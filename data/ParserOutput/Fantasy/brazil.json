As it comes closer we can see that it is, in fact, a MAN wearing strange woo and metal bird wings. In the bright sunshine their flapping movements create a brilliant, flashing effect. Along with the wings, SAM LOWRY (for this is he) wears an outfit that combines the best of Flash Gordon and a WWI fighter pilot. He sweeps past the CAMERA and then, banking, rises BACK INTO SHOT IN MCU. An ethereal voice can be heard calling \"Sam ... Sam ... Sam\". He hovers, looking beyond the CAMERA to something wonderful. CUT TO face of stunningly beautiful GIRL, she is the idealised twin of JILL LAYTON ... Her long hair swirls across her face partially obscuring it and making her appear slightl mysterious. The CAMERA PULLS AWAY from her as soft billowing material sinuously undulates about her. It rise and falls like waves carried on the wind. As the CAMERA GLIDES BACK through this sea of gossamer we can see that the GIRL is being held aloft by and in it. A vast landscape stretches below her. The sun frames her in the sky. She and SAM are engaged in a beautiful sensual aeria ballet. Romantic music fills the soundtrack. SAM swoops up and away. The GIRL floats in the distance a SAM. rises in the foreground. She beckons to him. SAM begins to flap back towards her. But then the dreamy quality of this scene is interrupted by threatening rumble. SAM looks down. The ground far below him suddenly erupts as a massive, monolithic stone skyscraper bursts through the surface an soars upwards with a mighty rush. CUT to the GIRL in LONG SHOT. The monolith rises up into FRAME partially cutting her off from view. Before SAM can do anything, another stone skyscraper breaks through the ground and rushes upwards. Then anothe and another. There is nothing SAM can do. The GIRL is being cut of from him by these gigantic faceless structures. And then she is finally lost from view somewhere in the depths of this strange stone metropolis. SAM lies closer. The stone skyscrapers appear to be solid No windows. No doors. Nothing whatsoever to interfere wit their clean, harsh, rectilinear design. As he flies among these towering blocks he sees no sign of the GIRL, only sheer walls rising high above him. Below him the walls plummet vertiginously into the darkish streets. No sound but the creaking flapping of his wings can he heard in this dead place. Coming round a corner he sees something in the distance. far below him a dark procession is wending its way through the narrow passages... away from him. CUT TO LOW ANGLE SHOT of the procession making its way past the CAMERA. Black-robed and cowled, the sinister figures look like heavily armed monks. These are the FORCES OF DARKNESS. Together they are straining at severa heavy hawsers that rise in long arcs up to a huge metal cage floating above and behind the procession. Binding th cage are metal straps to which ropes are attached. Inside is the GIRL - still enveloped in gossamer which billows a if there were a breeze in constant attendance. CUT TO SAM as He dives out of shot. CUT to the FORCES OF DARKNESS suddenly stopping in their tracks. They've seen something. CUT to their POV. There at the end of the passage between two stone skyscrapers stands SAM ... barring the way. CUT to swords being unsheathed. Cowls being thrown back. Underneath are rotting, broken dolls' faces. All the face are the same except for the manner in which they have decayed. They smile - slobbering, sickeningly. Suddenly the robed bodies change shape - some rising up to become long, others expanding sideways to become bulbous, others shrinking. From the folds of cloth come evil weapons. The FORCES are massed ready to charge. CUT to long shot of SAM. He removes his arms from his wings and folds the wings behind him. He is ready. Cut to the FORCES. Nothing moves ... except for the constant dribble from their cracked mouths. CUT back to SAM. Stillness. The tension is unbearable. Suddenly SAM unleashes a terrifying scream and charges th fearsome horde. Unarmed! CUT to the FORCES thundering down to SAM. Weapons flailin madly. SAM skillfully dodges the swordthrust of the leading field, and karate chops him senseless - at the same time catching his sword as he falls. Spinning around he parrie a spearthrust and skewers a third attacker. Slash! Hack! Stab! He lays waste to the FORCES. Nothing can stop this boy. The pile of black-robed bodies grows with each swing of SAM's sword. Wham! Bam! Smash! SAM carves his way through the mob with nary a scratch. And then, suddenly, they are all dead, but a heap of blackness to commemorate SAM's prowess. The GIRL is beaming as SAM makes his way toward the hawsers holding the cage. But then a noise behind him makes him turn. There, behind him the pile of black shapes begin to rise. The ropes become a mass of flapping black cloth. This evil churning cloud coalesces and lifts off the ground. The horrible flapping apparitio emits a terrifying maniacal laughter as it flies away. SA is about to rush after it to halt its escape but is stopped by the sound of a telephone ringing. He looks around - confused."

SAM, MOTHER and MAITRE D make their way across the room. The waltzing strains of the string quartet accompanying them. CUT to group of tables with diners. At one of them sits a wealthy-looking OLDER WOMAN with a rather plain-looking DAUGHTER in her 20s.

SAM follows it as it continues over the GIRL and down to the opposite horizon. Another crackling noise is heard. Another crack appears. Then another. And another. All these cracks are emanating from a vanishing point ove the horizon. Soon the sky is covered with these cracks from horizon to foreground. Then cracks begin appearing a right angles to them. Very quickly the sky is covered wit a mammoth grid. Once it is complete, another noise is heard. Something like massive blocks of stone sliding against one another. One of the squares formed by the gri pattern begins to slide upwards as if being pulled out from the back side of the sky. A square hole is left in its place. We can see the sides of the hole as it extends upwards into blackness. As soon as this first block of sk is withdrawn, another begins to slide up and away. SAM is frozen in position as this terrifying spectacle goes on above him. The eyeballs are madly looking this way and that. The grinding noises are deafening as block after block of sky is removed. With each successive loss the light decreases. The GIRL is crying out for SAM to save her. Frantically SAM tries to haul the cage down to the platform but it's too late. Where the sky was is now pitch black. Only one block of sky remains. Slowly that final bit of sky is pulled up an out of shot. Total blackness. A maniacal laughter can be heard. A beam of light is switched on. SAM has a searchlight in his hand and is searching the darkness. Th laughter continues. Suddenly the beam catches something black and moving. it's the same black, flapping cloth tha appeared at the end of the previous dream. The horrible flapping thing comes thundering down on SAM. He is engulfed in the black awfulness."

He grabs the pupil for a better handhold and it opens like a hatch cover. SAM manages to pull himself inside. Once out of th intergalactic maelstrom, SAM turns to survey the cramped and dark space inside the eyeball. It seems to be bisecte by a dividing wall, from which a thin sliver of light is escaping. Pushing on the wall in the area of the slit, SA is able to move a section. More light shaftes into the tiny space from around the edges of what appears to be a small hatch. SAM scrunches down and really puts his shoulder to the hatch. with a metallic rasp it gives way and SAM crashes through. CUT to other side of opening as SAM topples through. He catches himself in the nick of time as the camera zooms back revealing his close call with disaster. He is high o a vast wall of what looks like filing cabinets. The hatch he came through was the front of one of the millions of files-drawers composing this wall. As he scrambles back into the opening we can see that the wall drops away for hundreds of feet, disappear into a steaming mist. Other walls of files enclose this vast space. From where SAM is it looks like the view from the 50th storey of the Time Life building in NYC. These millions of files are being tended by MEN arising themselves up and down, as well as sideways, on modern skyscraper window-cleaners' platforms The attendants are seen putting PEOPLE in different perio costumes into drawers. SAM's attention is distracted by a sound overhead. Looking up he sees a window washer platform being lowered in his direction. Leaning over the side is a JOLLY GENT, who happens to look like MR HELPMAN (as seen on TV)."

From SAM'S POV, a piece of broken mirror lying on the floor reflects the hole in the ceiling ... with JILL's head and shoulders framed in the hole. The moment is unreal for SAM in his dazed condition. The vision seems unreal too. JILL is staring at SAM out of the piece of mirror and. she's very much the GIRL from his dream now."

Near one of the mounds are two long lines of shrouded FIGURES being forced into two giant cages, suspended beneath two great misshapen balloons. Th black-robed FORCES OF DARKNESS (FOD) surround the PRISONERS, relentlessly herding them towards the cages. The entire scene is strangely coloured by unearthly light The sky is blood red and where the sun should be is a black disc. SAM descends on his cape-parachute. CUT to PRISONERS in their grey shrouds, shuffling towards the jaws of the brutal cages. They are defeated, destroyed, without hope. The FOD prod and whip them forward. One of the FOD raises his spear to force a stumbling PRISONER to his feet but stops with the spear raised above his head. He has seen something. Other FODS turn to see what it is. CUT to SAM landing on the beach - a short distance away. The PRISONERS stop and look up. We see their faces clearly for the first time. One of them i MRS BUTTLE. Others are PEOPLE SAM saw in the flats, and the KIDS. SAM recognises them. He is slightly taken aback A look of determination crosses his face. He draws the sword. EVERYONE is frozen in place. SAM starts forward. But he is stopped by a violent tremor as the earth begins to tremble and shake. EVERYONE looks terrified. With a mighty roar a crack opens up in the ground between SAM an the OTHERS. Brilliant rays of light shaft upwards from th opening. And then, with a maniacal shriek, the large blac flapping thing shoots out of the crevasse and streaks hig into the sky. SAM hesitates and turns to look down into the light. There, under several meters of the earth's crust are fluffy white clouds darting about in a beautifu blue sky. SAM is delighted but as he looks up he is froze in his tracks by an enormous FIGURE that straddles the crevasse. This terrifying CREATURE stands over 12 feet high. He is encased in a frightening concoction of ancien Japanese armour which seems on closer examination to he made of computer parts. His face is hidden behind a horrific steel mask. It is the GIANT SAMURAI WARRIOR that was pushing the drawer closed in the Storeroom Of Knowledge. In his hand is an evil-looking spear. SAM is unsure which way to turn. The GREY PRISONERS are being loaded into the cages with more speed. He turns to face the GIANT WARRIOR. As SAM steps forward the GIANT stands ominously still. Then very slowly he raises his spear in an almost religious gesture. POOF! He vanishes. As he doe the light from the day is cut off. Looking down, SAM sees that he crevasse has vanished as well. Maniacal laughter from the flapping black thing makes SAM look up to see th ballooned cage packed with GREY PRISONERS rise up from th ground and begin to float away escorted by the Black flapping Thing. SAM rushes after it grabbing one of the trailing ropes. But as he is hoisted into the air it is severed by the FODS. He tumbles to the ground. Looking around he sees that, for some reason, the second balloone cage is still tethered nearby. SAM rushes over to it and begins chopping the tethers away. The cage bobbles ungainlily as SAM cuts the last restraining rope. Grabbing hold he is pulled upwards, but before he can reach the cage something clutches his leg halting his progress. As he struggles his other leg is caught. He is being pulled back by two giant hands. Looking down he can see that from the top of one of the smoking mounds a head and two giant arms protrude. The face looks like MR KURTZMAN. SAM desperately clings on to the rope as he struggles with the restraining hands. MR KURTZMAN OF THE MOUND"

He returns to lining up his pencils, placing a couple of bocks (phone books) against the wall on the left extreme of his desk. SAM turns his attention away from the books when suddenly the both fall over with a \"plop\". Puzzled, he stands the book up again, turns his eyes away and \"plop\". Same result. Intrigued, a bit exasperated, SAM carefully, and before his very eyes, the desk begins to disappear into the wall and \"plop\", the books topple over. Puzzled, SAM grabs hol of the desk and begins to try to pull it back through the wall. The desk moves back an inch or so, but then stops, somehow held stubbornly.

As he gets closer we can see that the snip is listing heavily to one side. In fact it is barely afloat. Closer still, it becomes apparent that the ship is made of stone Dark, evil, grey blocks of granite form not only the hull but the super-structures and smokestacks. It looks like a massive medieval fortress gone to sea. The screen is engulfed in stone. The CAMERA heads up the side of the ship. Higher and higher we climb - past course after course of mammoth stones. Reaching the first deck, we continue upwards. There appears to be no entrance. SAM is looking frustrated and angry. But then he spots an opening. A few stones have come loose - one of them juts out forming a ledge. As the cage passes, SAM jumps and managed to gain a foothold on the outcropping. Squeezing thru the gap in the rocks, he makes his way thru a dark passage. Emerging from the opening he finds himself teetering over an enormous abyss formed by the outer hull and the inner stone core of the ship. Great stone ribs curve downwards thru the darkness broken only by narrow shafts of brilliant light streaming from occasional crack and fissures in the stone core. For a brief moment SAM gets a glimpse of blue sky thru one of the openings but his attention is distracted by a distant moan. Huddled fa below him at the bottom of the dark abyss are hundreds of grey shrouded PRISONERS. Their moan blends with the creak and groans of the stones as the ship slowly wallows back and forth. Suddenly a great boom resounds throughout the ship. SAM is unsure where it comes from. And then another boom reverberates about him. He has to steady himself as the ship quivers from the noise. Another book. He clutche at the wall."

It doesn't return a second time, periodically something passes through the tubes causing them to move. SAM's pneumatic tubes continue to pulsate, pressure building up At this point SAM's desk begins, as before, to creep through the wall. He grabs it violently. He pulls it. There is a scream from the other side of the wall. SAM smiles. Th pneumatic tubes give a final convulsion and then there appears to be a muffled explosion outside SAM' office door. It shakes the whole building. SAM goes to hi door and opens it."

There in the bright pool of light are SAM's wings - beautiful, shimmering silver... But, nailed to a large stone cruciform - like a crucified eagle. SAM rushes towards them and begins to pull them loose, But before he can, a great cracking noise reverberates thru the ship and a black shadow falls across SAM and the wings. Looking roun he saees the inner wall has split open to the level of th floor - but, blocking the opening is the GIANT SAMURAI WARRIOR. SAM draws his sword and rushes toward the GIANT. The GIANT stands ominously still. Then very slowly he raises his spear in front of himself in an almost religious gesture. Poof! He vanishes! SAM is confused. Suddenly a PRISONER shouts a warning and SAM spins round just in time to avoid a slash of the spear by the giganti WARRIOR who is now standing directly behind him. SAM parries a couple more thrusts of the spear and then strikes with his sword. At thin air! The GIANT has vanished again. SAM can't figure it out. But he hears something whoosh and instinctively dodges as the GIANT wh is once again behind him brings the spear crashing down. Again SAM manages a few parries as he is forced backwards He trips and falls to the ground. The spear goes into the ground. Before the GIANT can wrench the spear loose, SAM slashes at him with his sword. But again the GIANT disappears. SA spins around. The GIANT is a short distance from him. SAM rushes him. Again he vanishes. This time he reappears nex to the spear and tries to free it. But SAM attacks again and the GIANT is forced to do his vanishing act before he can recover the spear. SAM is becoming exasperated with his behaviour, and as the GIANT reappears he shouts at hi to hold still, at the same time throwing his sword at the big fellow. The sword pins the GIANT's foot to the ground before he can disappear. Instead of blood pouring from th wound, fire issues forth. SAM takes advantage of the situation and manages to wrench the spear from the ground The GIANT is unable to escape as SAM charges, but manages to dodge a bit. However the spear catches his arm and opens a gash. Again fire pours out. As the big GUY tries to stop the fire, SAM charges again. This time he succeed in striking dead centre. The GIANT gasps as fire gushes from his chest. He staggers and crashes to the ground. Th wounds continue to bleed fire. SAM gets his breath back and approaches the fallen WARRIOR. Reaching down he removed the GIANT's mask. Fire rushes forth from all the facial orifices. But the thing that makes him catch his breath is the face itself. It's his ... SAM's! While he stares in amazement the fire begins to melt the face. In a moment it is unrecognizable SAM stands there stunned. Somewhere in the distance a bel tolls."

SAM's humming into a full orchestra, and we hear ...... \"Brazil, where hearts were entertained in June, We stood beneath an amber moon, And softly murmured 'Some day soon' We kissed and clung together, Then, tomorrow was another day.
