Why, in the twenty- five years since he and Uncle Billy  started this thing, he never once  thought of himself. Isn't that right,  Uncle Billy?  He didn't save enough  money to send Harry to school, let  alone me. But he did help a few people  get out of your slums, Mr. Potter.  And what's wrong with that? Why...   Here, you're all businessmen here.  Doesn't it make them better citizens?  Doesn't it make them better customers?  You... you said... What'd you say  just a minute ago?... They had to  wait and save their money before  they even ought to think of a decent  home. Wait! Wait for what? Until  their children grow up and leave  them?  Until they're so old and broken- down that they... Do you know how  long it takes a working man to save  five thousand dollars?  Just remember  this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble  you're talking about... they do most  of the working and paying and living  and dying in this community. Well,  is it too much to have them work and  pay and live and die in a couple of  decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my  father didn't think so. People were  human beings to him, but to you, a  warped, frustrated old man, they're  cattle. Well, in my book he died a  much richer man than you'll ever be!"
