The GUNMAN sees it, gestures for her to hand it over. But MARTHA is paralyzed, afraid to move. The GUNMAN steps past THOMAS, SNATCHES AT THE NECKLACE. The instant his wife is threatened, THOMAS ATTACKS. The  pearl strand BREAKS in the GUNMAN'S HAND as he drops towa the sidewalk. A SILENT BURST OF FLAME erupts from the muzzle of the gun THOMAS CRUMPLES. MARTHA emits a PIERCING SHRIEK -- a shri we cannot hear -- -- a shriek cut short by a second burst of flame. BRUCE stands paralyzed in shock. THE GUNMAN scoops a  handful of pearls off the sidewalk, reaches for MARTHA's  purse, and rises slowly -- his gun levelled directly at t boy. Almost catatonic, BRUCE stares down at the corpses of his parents. At their hands, somehow intertwined. At the tiny glinting pearls and the spreading pool of blood around  them. He looks up with a gaze so bleak, so petrifying... that t GUNMAN turns and runs. AND WE CUT. To an exact reproduction of the Pulitzer Priz winning photo... the cops bent over the bodies, the medic with their stretchers, the boy BRUCE, his arms wrapped  tightly around the waist of OFFICER GORDON. There's only one difference. BRUCE's head is turned away  from us.  We can't see his face . And now a HAND enters the frame. Much like the GUNMAN's  hand, but feminine, beckoning. BRUCE, hearing his name,  LOOKS UP; then, agonized, ashamed, he BURIES HIS FACE in  GORDON's side. GORDON gestures angrily at the intruder. But the hand keeps beckoning. And ultimately BRUCE turns. Showing us the tear-stained face from the famous photo"

Rumbling up the avenue at two-block   intervals, moored to floats, are DOZENS OF ENORMOUS  BALLOONS in the shapes of cartoon characters and historic figures. It's like a hellish Thanksgiving's day processio The LEAD-OFF BALLOON is a gigantic, grotesque CLOWN --  smiling ghoulishly, dressed in white pierrot frills. We  TILT DOWN to the FLOAT BENEATH IT...  ... and there, atop a mountain of roses where the prom queen should be, sits the JOKER -- smiling, waving dainti at the rioters and looters, presiding over the carnage li some demented parade marshal."
