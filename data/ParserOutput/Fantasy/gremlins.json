The Oriental rests the box on a stack of crates. He opens the box. A TINY CREATURE is inside'. The animal is eleven inches tall and stands; upright on two legs. It has two arms, with small; four-fingered hands. Its body is covered with fluffy brown fur. The piercing eyes are big, sad. Its ears are long and pointed A tiny black nose sits above a wide mouth, with small, square teeth. The creature is smiling. It lets out a giggle. Rand is delighted and surprised. He's never seen anything like this. The animal is more charming than a Disney character. The Oriental claps his hands. The creature leaps from the box, onto Rand's shoulder. The animal licks Rand's cheek.' He laughs, amused by the creature. The Oriental claps his hands again. The creature hops back into the box. It stares at Rand with those cute green eyes'."
