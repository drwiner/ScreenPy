In the f.g., we see the silhouetted  figures of Chinese running away from  Baskul and toward the Camera, their  personal packs on their backs. 3. MED. CLOSE SHOT Toward office building. Conway comes  out of the building, followed by a small  group of white people with frightened  faces. They have to fight their way  through a horde of milling Chinese. 4. MEDIUM SHOT As Conway and group finally reach the  plane where Conway forces the white  people in. In this he is aided by his  brother, George, a young and vigorous  Englishman. The pilot sticks his head  out of the cockpit. ? 472 ? PILOT Conway, we can't take more than seven! Conway pulls a passenger out and gives  the pilot a signal to start. CONWAY (to passenger) All right. I'm sorry. There will be  another plane in a minute. All right  - go on. 5. LONG SHOT Motors roar, and the plane starts to  move, scattering those of the Chinese  who were unfortunately too close to  the ship. Conway and George rush back  into the office building. INT. LARGE OFFICE ROOM 6. FULL SHOT There are about thirty white refugees,  men, women and several children. They  all lift their panicky faces to Conway  and George as they enter. A barrage  of questions are flung at them. AD-LIB Are there any more planes? Do you think  the bandits will come here? Please take  my wife next, Mr. Conway! CONWAY Wait, wait! Everybody, wait! There are  plenty of planes coming. Now everybody  have patience. Everything will be all  right. He crosses to a back room. GEORGE You have nothing to worry about. Leave  everything to my brother. INT. RADIO ROOM 7. MEDIUM SHOT As Conway enters to speak to operator. RADIO OPERATOR Yes, sir - with seven passengers aboard. RADIO SPEAKER Seven passengers? Good. CONWAY Get me Shanghai. OPERATOR I'm talking to them now, sir. CONWAY Hello? Hello? RADIO SPEAKER Hello. Hello. CONWAY (into mike) Conway speaking. Is Colonel Marsh there? ? 473 ? COLONEL'S VOICE Right here, Conway. Go ahead. 8. CLOSE SHOT As Conway continues into mike. CONWAY Colonel, I need more planes. I've still  about twenty people to get out. Where  are those planes you promised us? COLONEL'S VOICE We sent everything we could find, Conway. CONWAY They better get here soon or I can't  be responsible 9. WIDER ANGLE As George rushes in. GEORGE Bob! I think I hear motors! CONWAY (listening - then into mike) Colonel, wait a minute, they may be  here now! (to George) Say George, get down on that field and  guide those planes in when they get  here. GEORGE Yes. He starts for the door. CONWAY And be sure that none of the natives  get in. GEORGE (exiting) Yes. CONWAY Hello? Colonel? COLONEL'S VOICE Hello, Conway. Yes? CONWAY Thanks - and take care of that liver  of yours. COLONEL'S VOICE Oh, ho - my word! INT. OFFICE ROOM 10. FULL SHOT As Conway enters. CONWAY All right, get ready everybody. The  planes are here. The people crowd around him pleading  for priority. ? 474 ? CONWAY One at a time. Children first. Where  are they? Come on now, and stand over  here. A woman pushes some children forward. CONWAY Where's the mother? PRIEST (standing nearby) They're orphans, Mr. Conway. CONWAY I see. All right. (directing people aside - pulling out  an old lady) Well, you come - right over here - and  you, and you (looking off scene) come on OLD MAN What about us, Mr. Conway? CONWAY Gentlemen, please wait your turn. 11. CLOSE SHOT A girl slouched in a corner. We meet  Gloria Stone, a surly, wan-looking prostitute. GLORIA You'd better take some of those squealing  men with you first. They might faint  on you. I'll wait. 12. CLOSE SHOT - CONWAY Something of a smile crosses his face. CONWAY Just as you say! Just then, a terrific explosion is heard  in the distance. 13. FULL SHOT All the lights go out. Everybody starts  screaming. CONWAY (sharply) Whoa! Don't lose your heads now - I'll  see what it is. He dashes out. EXT. OFFICE BUILDING 14. CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR Conway rushing out, meets George coming  back. GEORGE The power house - they've blown it up!  The planes can't land without lights. ? 475 ? CONWAY (thinking fast) Come on! We'll burn the hangar. That  will make light for them! He grabs a lantern and dashes off. 15. MEDIUM SHOT As they run through the screaming mob  toward the hangar. INTERIOR HANGAR 16. FULL SHOT It is filled with Chinese refugees clinging  to their household goods. Conway and  George enter. Conway speaks to them  in Chinese, ordering them out. Some  hesitate, and they have to push the  terror-stricken waiting coolies out.  When they have all left, Conway opens  the spigots of several gasoline tanks,  waits for the fuel to spill on the ground,  then tosses a lantern on the fuel, igniting  a blaze. At the same moment, he and  George dash for the door. EXTERIOR FIELD 17. LONG SHOT Conway and George rush out of hangar.  When they are at a fairly safe distance,  the building bursts into flames. DISSOLVE TO: 18. LONG SHOT Against a background of the burning  hangar, a plane is just leaving the  ground, as another one is landing. 19. MEDIUM SHOT Of Conway, signalling. CONWAY All right, go ahead! (to George) We go on to the next plane. Bring out  any people that are left. GEORGE Right, Bob. 20. REVERSE ANGLE - LONG SHOT Shooting toward the burning city of  Baskul in the distance. We see the bandits  coming, flashing bayonets, in pursuit  of screaming refugees. 21. MED. SHOT FRONT OF OFFICE BUILDING Conway emerges, followed by Gloria,  and an American, Barnard. CAMERA FOLLOWS  THEM to the ship just as the pilot,  Fenner, is climbing down from cockpit. CONWAY Hello, Fenner. FENNER (broad grin) Hello, Conway. Having a little trouble? ? 476 ? CONWAY You never mind me. Get this gadget off  the ground. George is pushing off Chinese. GEORGE Bob, these are all that are left. CONWAY (to George) Come on! Quick! This way. 22. MED. SHOT AT PLANE When Conway and others approach, George  helps Gloria Stone up, while Conway  faces the mob, punching at those who  try to wedge their way forward. Finally  one of them manages to get his foot  on the step, and Conway pushes him violently. 23. CLOSE SHOT - MAN Who staggers back and falls, sprawling.  As he hits the ground, he yells: MAN You can't leave me here, you blighter.[2]  I'm a British subject! We meet Alexander P. Lovett. 24. MEDIUM SHOT Conway looks his surprise and lifts  him off the ground. 25. CLOSE SHOT - A CHINAMAN Glaring off toward Conway, picks up  a board and starts toward Conway. 26. MED. CLOSE SHOT ENTRANCE TO SHIP George emerges in time to see the Chinese  lift the board and about to clout Conway  on the head. George moves quickly, puts  out his left hand, wards off the blow  and with his right he punches the Chinese,  who reels out of the scene. GEORGE Look out, Bob! 27. MEDIUM SHOT A shadowy figure materializes in the  cockpit, and clubs Fenner from behind.  He shoves Fenner aside and takes his  place. 28. MEDIUM SHOT Conway pushes George up and starts to  mount himself. He looks off - and what  he sees startles him. CONWAY (yells off) All right, Fenner! Go ahead! ? 477 ? 29. LONG SHOT Of what Conway sees. Several trucks  loaded with bandits - in makeshift uniforms  - come tearing up the road - come to  a stop. Some fire toward plane - others  are setting up machine guns. Droves  of refugees scramble to cover. INT. PLANE 30. FULL SHOT Already present are Barnard, an American;  Gloria Stone, the prostitute; and Lovett,  whom we saw dressed as a Chinese. Conway  slams the door shut - looks off - then  cries: CONWAY Get down on the floor, everybody. Go  ahead, Fenner! They all fall on their faces. GEORGE Fenner, let's go! 31. MED. CLOSE SHOT Of the new pilot setting the controls  and lifting the plane into flight. EXT. FIELD 32. LONG SHOT As the plane swings around - taxies  crazily - and leaves the ground, accompanied  by gunfire of the bandits. INT. PLANE 33. FULL SHOT The occupants are still on the floor.  Conway rises and glances out of a window,  warily. CONWAY (mumbling) Well, I guess we're out of range. (to others) Everybody all right? There are murmurs of \"Yes\" - \"I'm all  right\" - as they raise themselves. GEORGE Whew! That was close. 34. MEDIUM SHOT Conway starts for the back seat and  suddenly sees Lovett. CONWAY Where did you come from? LOVETT I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir. CONWAY Why aren't you registered through our  office? ? 478 ? GEORGE (chiming in) It would serve you right if you were  left behind. LOVETT (high-pitched voice) How could I know that a war was going  to break out right over my head! (a grave injustice) Right over my head. Oh, my word! I tell  you, those Chinese were pouncing on  me from every direction. I had to get  into these ridiculous clothes in order  to escape. CONWAY Where were you hiding? LOVETT Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the  interior - hunting fossils. This morning  I looked up suddenly CONWAY I know - and a war broke out right over  your head. GEORGE The next time you're in wild country  like this, keep in touch with the British  Consul. CONWAY Aha - very good, Freshie.[3] Very good.  You'd better put his name on the list  and make out a report later. He proceeds to the back seat. Barnard,  the American, who is in front of Lovett,  leans over toward him. 35. MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO Barnard and Lovett. BARNARD I beg your pardon, brother. What did  you say you were hunting? LOVETT Fossils. BARNARD Fossils, huh? LOVETT I'm a paleontologist. BARNARD (blankly) A what? LOVETT A paleontologist. ? 479 ? BARNARD Oh, I see. Lovett produces a small box clutched  under his arm. LOVETT I have here a discovery that will startle  the world. It's the vertebrae from the  lumbar of a Megatherium,[4] found in  Asia. BARNARD Well, what do you know about that! LOVETT Found in Asia! BARNARD Uh-huh. LOVETT When I get home I shall probably be  knighted for it. BARNARD Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind  if I take a look at it? LOVETT (proudly) Not at all. He lifts the lid and Barnard peeks inside. INSERT: OF BOX Wrapped carefully in absorbent cotton  is something that resembles a dry chicken  bone. BACK TO SCENE: Barnard reaches for the box, but Lovett  pulls it away from him. BARNARD Sorry. LOVETT This is the only thing I was able to  save when those heathens surrounded  me. BARNARD (he is allowed to take it out and examine  it - unimpressed) Uh-huh. LOVETT You see, from this vertebrae I shall  be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton. BARNARD Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted  for finding that soupbone? LOVETT It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium  - found in Asia. ? 480 ? BARNARD Yeah, I remember. You said that before. LOVETT Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and  he never got beyond the mesozoic era. Barnard stares at Lovett unbelievingly. BARNARD Ah, poor fellow. Lovett glares at him resentfully, and  snaps the lid shut on his box. LOVETT Yes, it just shows (taking offense) I don't know why I'm talking to you.  I don't know you. Who are you? BARNARD (turns away) Okay, brother. LOVETT Don't call me brother. BARNARD Okay, sister. (chuckles to himself) No offense. No offense! 36. CLOSE SHOT - GLORIA AND BARNARD Gloria sits slumped in her seat, looking  glumly out. Barnard glances at her curiously.  Finally he makes a friendly overture. BARNARD Cigarette? Gloria turns her head, surveys Barnard  coldly, and without responding, turns  back. BARNARD I say, will you have a cigarette? GLORIA No. BARNARD (unabashed) Say, you're an American, aren't you? GLORIA (irascibly) Say, listen - will you go and annoy  the rest of your playmates? Let me alone! He shrugs his shoulders and slides back  into his seat. ? 481 ? 37. FULL SHOT All is silent for a moment. Conway is  writing on a small pad - which he rests  on an uplifted knee. George is rummaging  through a closet - rear of the cabin. 38. MED. SHOT - GEORGE AND CONWAY Conway still writes, undisturbed. George  reaches into the closet and emerges  with a bottle of whiskey. His face lights  up. GEORGE (holds up bottle) Hello! Look what I found! He crosses to Conway. GEORGE Just what I needed too. CONWAY (looks up - smiling) You? GEORGE Just this once, Bob. I feel like celebrating.  Just think of it, Bob - a cruiser sent  to Shanghai just to take you back to  England. You know what it means. (hands him cup) Here you are. Don't bother about those  cables now. I want you to drink with  me. (holds his cup up) Gentlemen, I give you Robert Conway  - England's new Foreign Secretary. Conway watches him, amused. George gulps  down his drink. CONWAY (after a slight hesitation - downing  his drink) Hurray! GEORGE How I'm going to bask in reflected glory! (dreamily) People are going to point to me and  say, \"There goes George Conway - brother  of the Foreign Secretary.\" CONWAY Don't talk nonsense. Give me the bottle. Conway takes the bottle from him and  pours himself a second drink. GEORGE That's why they're sending for you,  Bob. With all these foreign entanglements,  it was bound to happen. They need you. Conway, with a poured drink in hand,  laughs. GEORGE All right, you can laugh if you want  to. But who else can they get? Who else  is there in all of England half the  fighter, half the diplomat, who ? 482 ? has half your knowledge of the foreign  situation? They can't stop you now,  Bob. Conway moodily pours himself a third.  He downs the drink as we DISSOLVE TO: INT. PLANE 39. CLOSE SHOT OF CONWAY We find Conway, asleep in his seat,  his head on his hands. George approaches  and tenderly spreads a jacket over his  shoulders. Conway stirs, opens an eye. CONWAY (drunkenly) Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report  out yet? GEORGE Yes, Bob. CONWAY Did you say we saved ninety white people? GEORGE Yes. CONWAY Hurray for us. Did you say that we left  ten thousand natives down there to be  annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that.  They don't count. GEORGE You'd better try to get some sleep,  Bob. CONWAY Just you wait until I'm Foreign Secretary.  Can't you just see me, Freshie, with  all those other shrewd, little Foreign  Secretaries? (confidentially - screws up face) You see, the trick is to see who can  out-talk the other. Everybody wants  something for nothing, and if you can't  get it with smooth talk, you send an  army in. I'm going to fool them, Freshie.  I'm not going to have an army. I'm going  to disband mine. I'm going to sink my  battleships - I'm going to destroy every  piece of warcraft. Then when the enemy  approaches we'll say, \"Come in, gentlemen  - what can we do for you?\" So then the  poor enemy soldiers will stop and think.  And what will they think, Freshie? They'll  think to themselves - \"Something's wrong  here. We've been duped. This is not  according to form. These people seem  to be quite friendly, and why should  we shoot them?\" Then they'll lay down  their arms. You see how simple the whole  thing is? Centuries of tradition kicked  right in the pants (pause - drily) and I'll be slapped straight into the  nearest insane asylum. He starts to pour himself another drink. ? 483 ? GEORGE You'd better not drink any more, Bob.  You're not talking sense. Conway downs the drink, and then chuckles  cynically. CONWAY Don't worry, George. Nothing's going  to happen. I'll fall right into line.  I'll be the good little boy that everybody  wants me to be. I'll be the best little  Foreign Secretary we ever had, just  because I haven't the nerve to be anything  else. GEORGE Do try to sleep, Bob. CONWAY Huh? Oh, sure, Freshie. Good thing,  sleep. He grunts and squirms. George tucks  him in. CONWAY Did you ever notice the sunrise in China,  George? Ah, you should. It's beautiful. He gets settled. George relaxes and,  leaning back, shuts his eyes. 40. LONG SHOT OF CABIN It is quiet. All are asleep. CAMERA  MOVES FORWARD SLOWLY until it reaches  the glass panel leading to the cockpit.  The pilot's face turns. Instead of Fenner  we see a strange, Mongolian face - with  sharp, piercing eyes. A half-smile plays  across his mouth. EXT. SHOT OF PLANE 41. LONG SHOT OF PLANE Flying at high speed against a moonlit  sky. We stay on the shot until it vanishes,  a mere speck, over the horizon. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. SHOT - DAWN 42. LONG SHOT The morning sun peeks over a mountain  top. From the same direction, as if  arriving with the sun, the ship looms  up, and comes roaring toward us. INT. PLANE 43. FULL SHOT All are asleep except Lovett, who fidgets  on his seat. Then Barnard stirs - opens  his eyes - and stretches. As he does  so, he sees that Lovett is awake. BARNARD Good morning, Lovey. LOVETT I beg your pardon. BARNARD I say, good morning, Lovey. ? 484 ? LOVETT Good morning (catches himself) Look here, young man. BARNARD Eh? LOVETT I didn't care for 'sister' last night,  and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning.  My name is Lovett - Alexander, P. BARNARD I see. LOVETT I see. BARNARD Well, it's a good morning, anyway. LOVETT I'm never conversational before I coffee. Barnard glances out of the window, looks  around outside thoughtfully. BARNARD Wait a minute. Is it a good morning?  Say, we're supposed to be travelling  east, aren't we? LOVETT Why, of course. Yes. BARNARD Well, it looks to me as if we're travelling  west. LOVETT That's ridiculous. BARNARD Is it? LOVETT It certainly is. BARNARD Look here LOVETT Any child knows how to tell direction.  Any child. I don't care where the child  is - in the air, on the earth, or in  the sea. If you face the rising sun,  your right hand is the north, and your  left hand is the south BARNARD I always get it twisted because I'm  left-handed. LOVETT Oh, really? ? 485 ? BARNARD Yes. LOVETT Well, you just reverse it. Your left  hand is (tries to explain - gets confused and  irritated) What difference does it make what 'hand'  you are? The north is the north! BARNARD Uh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises  in the east, and we're going away from  it. LOVETT Now you're irritating and absurd! 44. CLOSE SHOT - LOVETT As he sulks by himself, looks around  - locates the sun in back of him - smiles  - satisfied he's right, throws a condescending  glance over at Barnard - then suddenly  his face clouds - the whole thing dawns  on him. LOVETT (jumps up shrieking) Oh, my word - of course - yes. Boy!  Boy, we're travelling in the wrong direction!  Wake up! We're going in the wrong direction! 45. FULL SHOT Conway is still asleep. GEORGE (concerned for Conway) Couldn't you arrange to make a little  less noise? LOVETT I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai  is east of here! GEORGE Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in  China. He knows what he's doing. LOVETT (not quite reassured) It's Fenner. BARNARD He might have lost his way. LOVETT Of course. That's what I told them last  night. You can't expect a man to sail  around in the dark.[5] During this George has been looking  around - he rises. GEORGE All right, all right. Calm yourself.  I'll talk to Fenner. ? 486 ? He crosses to panel leading to cockpit,  CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM. When he gets there  he knocks on the window. GEORGE Fenner! I - I say George knocks again. From the cockpit  side - the small shade suddenly snaps  up - and George finds himself staring  into the face of the mysterious pilot.  He takes an instinctive step backward.  The pilot turns his head. CAMERA ANGLE  WIDENS as George keeps backing up until  he gets to Conway. George turns to Conway  and shakes his shoulder. GEORGE Bob! Bob! Conway stirs in his sleep, slowly opens  his eyes, yawns and stretches. Throughout  it, George speaks. GEORGE Wake up! Something's happened! It isn't  Fenner in the cockpit! Conway looks at him, glances off toward  the others, and back at George. CONWAY (dismissing him with a gesture) Oh, stop it! GEORGE The bloke up there looks a Chinese,  or a Mongolian, or something. BARNARD We're nowhere near Shanghai. We're going  in the opposite direction. This interests Conway and he looks out  of the window. CONWAY We're over the desert. That's funny. Then rising, he crosses to cockpit.  The others watch him expectantly. 46. GROUP SHOT - AROUND COCKPIT Conway pounds on the panel. The face  of the pilot appears in sight. Conway  tries to ask him something in Chinese.  The pilot glares at them for a second,  then a gun is shoved out at them. Instinctively  they back away. CONWAY Charming chap. BARNARD (not being funny) Nice puss to meet in a dark alley. The ship lurches - and they are thrown  off balance. The panel has been snapped  shut. ? 487 ? CONWAY Well, that's that, I guess. BARNARD Wonder what's happened to Fenner. LOVETT Yes. And who is he ? How'd he get there? BARNARD Do you suppose we stopped someplace  during the night and changed pilots? CONWAY No. That's not possible! If we had landed,  we all would have been awakened. LOVETT Of course. We never left the air. I  know - I didn't sleep the whole night  long. CONWAY (with finality) That fellow got on at Baskul. LOVETT What's he doing? Where's he taking us?  He may be a maniac for all we know. George, who has disappeared during the  above, now returns, with a monkey wrench  in his hand. Conway stops him. CONWAY George, what are you going to do? GEORGE I'm going to drag him out and force  him to tell us what his game is. LOVETT Good. CONWAY What if he refuses? LOVETT We'll smash his face in. That's what  we'll do. CONWAY Brilliant! (a sweeping gesture) Can anyone here fly a plane? There is a general chorus of \"nonot  I,\" etc. CONWAY (takes wrench from George's hand) Well, George, that's no good. Conway throws the monkey wrench into  a corner. ? 488 ? CONWAY I guess we're in for it. LOVETT In for what? CONWAY I don't know. He must have had some  purpose in taking the plane away from  Fenner. (starts for his seat) When he lands, we'll find out. LOVETT You mean to tell me you're not going  to do anything until we land? CONWAY What do you suggest? LOVETT Why, you - you Look here - he may dash  us to pieces! CONWAY It might afford you a great deal of  relief. (sitting) Now gentlemen, I'm going back to sleep.  Oh, and I was having such a peaceful  dream. (curling up) As soon as he lands, let me know. He shuts his eyes and leans back. The  others watch him for a second - and  wander back to their seats. 47. CLOSE SHOT - GLORIA AND BARNARD Gloria is apparently indifferent to  their predicament. As Barnard watches  her, a little bitter smile plays around  her mouth. 48. CLOSE SHOT - GEORGE He stares out of the window and is suddenly  startled. EXT. SHOT OF PLANE 49. LONG SHOT Of the plane with its nose turned downward  in a sharp descent. INT. CABIN OF PLANE 50. MEDIUM SHOT George is on his feet. GEORGE (excited) We're heading down! We're going to land! Everyone looks out. George rushes to  Conway and nudges him. GEORGE (breathlessly) Bob, we're landing! (pointing out) Bob, we're coming to a village! Conway sits up and looks out. ? 489 ? EXT. SHOT OF PLANE 51. MEDIUM SHOT Plane starting toward ground. All we  can see are mountain tops. INT. PLANE 52. MEDIUM SHOT They all stare out of the windows. Conway  peers intently. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. SHOT FROM AIRPLANE 53. LONG SHOT From angle in cabin of plane. Through  the window, directly below we see a  large open space at the foot of the  hills. The plane is headed for it. 54. LONG SHOT We see a swarm of strange-looking natives,  scantily attired, but bearing bayonets,  running toward the plane. INT. PLANE 55. MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT Of George and Conway, as the ship hits  the ground, bouncing and swaying perilously. EXT. MOUNTAINOUS COUNTRY 56. MEDIUM SHOT As the plane taxies across the uninhabited  space. INTERIOR PLANE 57. MED. CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR Conway and George ready to get out.  As Conway turns to open the door, he  looks off and is startled by something  he sees. George follows his gaze, and  a bewildered expression comes into his  eyes, too. EXTERIOR OF PLANE 58. LONG SHOT Shooting through door. The strange-looking  natives have surrounded the plane and  are closing in. INTERIOR PLANE 59. MEDIUM SHOT Conway and George both instinctively  wheel around toward the opposite side.  But from that direction too, a horde  of natives dash toward them. Conway  hesitates a second, and like a flash  springs for the door. But he stops again,  as he opens the door. EXTERIOR OF PLANE 60. MEDIUM SHOT To include door of plane. Conway finds  himself staring into the threatening  mouths of half a dozen rifles, and quickly  shuts the door. GEORGE What are these people? CONWAY I don't know. I can't get the dialect. ? 490 ? EXTERIOR OF PLANE 61. MEDIUM SHOT THROUGH WINDOW We see the pilot and several natives  in single file as they come toward the  plane, buckets in hand. In b.g., one  of them lowers a bucket into a well  in the ground. GEORGE Look - they're loading up with gasoline. EXTERIOR OF PLANE 62. SEVERAL SHOTS The gas is being loaded. Natives on  horseback dash back and forth shouting  and signalling. Camels can be glimpsed  among the horses. There is tremendous  disorder and commotion. 63. LONG SHOT The ship leaves the ground. The natives  stand around, curiously watching. INTERIOR PLANE 64. MEDIUM SHOT Conway is pacing. The occupants sit  by their open windows. CONWAY Imagine having all that fuel there,  waiting for us! (he sits down) George, something tells me our journey  is just beginning. LOVETT Where are we going? Huh? BARNARD (pointing) If you ask me, we're heading straight  for those mountains. EXTERIOR SHOT 65. LONG SHOT We see the plane against the sky. In  the b.g., there is nothing but snow-covered  mountains. DISSOLVE TO: INSERT: A sign reading \"Shanghai Municipal  Airport.\" INT. AIRPORT 66. MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT A Chinese officer is on the phone. CHINESE OFFICER A Douglas plane[6] from Baskul with  Conway and four others aboard are missing.  Unreported between here and Baskul. QUICK SHOTS of: A switchboard operator besieged by calls. A telegraph secretary furiously typing. Newspapers being run off a press. ? 491 ? INT. FOREIGN OFFICE 67. CLOSE SHOT Of a high official of the British Foreign  Office. HIGH OFFICIAL (holding forth to his secretary) Make it very emphatic that His Majesty's  Government will hold the Chinese government  and all Chinese governors of Chinese  provinces responsible for the complete  safety of Robert Conway. THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal other  foreign department officials and functionaries  arriving in the midst of his speech. HIGH OFFICIAL Good morning, gentlemen. FUNCTIONARIES (ad-libbing) Good morning, etc. OFFICIAL No news yet, sir? HIGH OFFICIAL It's fantastic. The plane couldn't disappear  into thin air. (turning to secretary of the group) And cable Lord Gainsford at Shanghai.  Leave no stone unturned to find Conway. (turning back to foreign officials) And Robertson? ROBERTSON Yes, sir? HIGH OFFICIAL Better get a postponement of the Far  East conference. We can't afford to  meet those nations without Conway. INT. PLANE 68. MED. SHOT The occupants are hunched up in the  corner of their seats. What little clothes  they have, and what few blankets, are  bundled around them. All the windows  are shut. INSERT: ALTOMETER Registering a height of 10,000 feet. 69. FULL SHOT There is silence for a moment before  Barnard speaks. BARNARD It can't be kidnapping. They wouldn't  be taking us so far on such a dangerous  trip. No sense to it. No one responds to his speculation and  he lapses into silence. ? 492 ? 70. MED. SHOT To include George, Conway and Lovett. GEORGE What do you make of it, Bob? You must  have some idea? Conway shrugs. CONWAY Huh? I give it up. But this not knowing  where you're going is exciting anyway. LOVETT Well, Mr. Conway, for a man who is supposed  to be a leader, your do-nothing attitude  is very disappointing. GEORGE What do you want him to do? LOVETT I don't know. I'm a paleontologist,  not a Foreign Secretary. Lovett slips back into his corner and  pulls his coat over his face. INSERT: OF ALTOMETER Registering above 10,000 feet. We STAY  on it as it climbs and climbs to 15,000  feet. EXT. MOUNTAINOUS COUNTRY 71. Showing the plane high over mountain  peaks. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. SHOT OF PLANE - NIGHT 72. LONG SHOT Against a moonlit sky, we see a lone  speck - the plane as it flies high above  the mountains. It appears to be traveling  through endless space. INT. PLANE 73. MED. SHOT The atmosphere is pervaded with a feeling  of utter futility. The occupants are  still slumped in the corners of their  seats. 74. CLOSE SHOT - GLORIA AND BARNARD Gloria has a fit of coughing. She grabs  her throat - as she gasps for breath.  Barnard, himself feeble and exhausted,  glances over at her sympathetically. 75. WIDER SHOT Including Lovett, George, and Conway.  Lovett sits with his chin helplessly  on his chest, his mouth ludicrously  open, his eyes popping. George, his  teeth clenched, struggles against a  desire to sob. Conway looks at him feelingly. 76. CLOSE SHOT - GEORGE AND CONWAY Conway's eyes never leave George, who  finally unable to control himself, emits  a sob - and rather ashamed, slaps his  hand over his mouth and turns away. ? 493 ? CONWAY Oh George, come on. GEORGE (suddenly - tensely) It's not knowing that's so awful, Bob.  Not knowing where you're going, or why,  or what's waiting when you get there. George, with an effort, stifles another  outbreak. CONWAY We got above that storm. INSERT: OF ALTOMETER At 20,000 feet - and while we stay on  it - keeps mounting. INTERIOR CABIN 77. FULL SHOT Deathly silence. Gloria has her hands  to her ears, rocking in pain. Suddenly  her voice rents the air. GLORIA Oh! Oh! I can't stand it any longer! She jumps up and moves about frantically. GLORIA (screaming) Take us down! I can't stand this pain  any longer! Let me out of here I say!  I can't stand it any longer! She runs to one of the ship's doors  and pounds on it with her fist, then  tries to shove it open. A blast of frigid  air throws her back. George and Conway  manage to pry her off and pull her away.  Sobbing pitifully, she lets Conway steer  her back to her seat, where she bundles  up in torturous pain. For a moment nothing  is heard but her stifled moans. BARNARD Take it easy, sister. Unexpectedly the cockpit panel opens,  and the pilot tosses something out in  Gloria's direction. CONWAY (grabbing for it) It's oxygen! (he rigs it up for her) Now take it with your teeth. That's  right - bite. GLORIA (struggling) Let me alone. CONWAY Now, now. Come on now. That's right.  Now, bite. She resumes her sobbing quietly. ? 494 ? DISSOLVE TO: EXT. PLANE 78. LONG SHOT Of the plane at twilight, fading into  deepest night. INT. PLANE 79. FULL SHOT Of the cabin at night, everyone frozen  in despair. All of a sudden there is  a loud, sputtering noise from the outside.  They all react - listen for a moment  - until the noise dies completely. Now  nothing is heard - not even the motor. AD-LIB (breaking the silence) What's that! What's happening? CONWAY (immediately on his feet) He must have run out of fuel. BARNARD Look! Look down there! EXT. PLANE 80. LONG SHOT The plane gradually tilting downward. INT. PLANE 81. FULL SHOT The ship sways several seconds and finally  rights itself. EXT. PLANE 82. LONG SHOT Of what they see from plane. Vast snow-covered  mountain peaks, with no sign of a stretch  big enough to land. 83. LONG SHOT The plane sways perilously in the cross  wind. INTERIOR PLANE 84. MEDIUM SHOT They are all silent - waiting prayerfully.  Conway turns to the others - his voice  electric with authority. CONWAY George - everybody - better get back  towards the tail! He may nose her over.  Into the corner, quick! George - cushions,  blankets! They obey his command. EXTERIOR SHOT OF PLANE 85. LONG SHOT We see the plane nearing the ground,  sailing over some smaller hills. INTERIOR PLANE 86. MED. CLOSE SHOT With Conway in front of them, the others  are crouching in the corner. There are  ad-libs of fearful assurances while  they hand around cushions and blankets. ? 495 ? EXTERIOR SHOT OF PLANE 87. LONG SHOT Just as the ship hits the ground for  the first time. INTERIOR PLANE 88. MED. CLOSE SHOT The occupants brace themselves for the  jolt. The ship hits and bounces several  times and finally stops. Its nose seems  to bury itself in the ground. The people  are lifted high into the air where they  remain, suspended for a few seconds,  terror-stricken. Then, accompanied by  grinding, crackling sounds, the ship  flops back and falls on its side. For  a moment there is stark silence - while  the people do not stir. A look of relief  spreads over their faces. CONWAY Everybody all right? The passengers offer dazed replies:  \"Okay - yeah - I think so.\" Meanwhile,  Conway has opened the door. A swirling  mass of snow greets them, so that they  have to force their way out. EXTERIOR OF PLANE 89. MEDIUM SHOT George and Conway fight their way down  from the plane in the blinding snow.  George quickly runs around to the other  side. Conway crosses to the cockpit,  and clambers aboard. 90. CLOSE SHOT IN THE COCKPIT Lit only by the dashboard light. Conway  sticks his head in from the outside.  His eyes which have been flashing with  determination suddenly sober. CAMERA  PANS OVER to pilot, who is slumped over,  his chin resting on his chest. 91. MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT George pops into view on the opposite  side, just as Conway has found the pilot's  gun beside him on the seat. GEORGE What is it? Has he fainted? CONWAY It looks like it. (sniffing) Smell those fumes? Conway hops up beside the pilot. George  follows suit. CONWAY (handing gun to George) Here George, take the gun. Hold the  lights. I'm going to search him before  he comes to. (while searching) We might find something interesting. (finds something) Hello - what's this? A map! (hands it to George) He resumes his search enthusiastically.  Suddenly he stops. The utter limpness  of the pilot's body gives him pause.  He lifts up his chin, stares into his  face - pulls up his eyelid and then  places a hand over his heart. He turns  slowly toward George, who has been watching  his brother intently. ? 496 ? CONWAY He's dead. GEORGE Dead? George stares unbelievingly. CONWAY It must have happened the moment he  hit the ground. (a pause) Let's take a look at this map. Conway holds the map under the dashboard  light. He studies it painstakingly,  and his tense expression changes to  one of deep concern. George's eyes are  glued on him. GEORGE What is it? CONWAY See that spot? GEORGE Yes. CONWAY That's where we were this morning. He  had it marked. Right on the border of  Tibet. Here's where civilization ends.  We must be a thousand miles beyond it  - just a blank on the map. GEORGE (afraid to ask) What's it mean? CONWAY It means we're in unexplored country  - country nobody ever reached. George stares at him, wide-eyed, the  gravity of their situation slowly penetrating  his terrorized mind. Conway's thoughts  are interrupted by a knock on the panel,  and he looks up. 92. MED. CLOSE SHOT THROUGH GLASS PANEL We see the faces of Barnard and the  others. We hear their voices inquiring  - \"Hey, Conway, what's happening?\" -  \"What's up?\" - \"Where are we?\" - \"What'd  you find out?\" 93. CLOSE SHOT - CONWAY AND GEORGE Conway turns to George. CONWAY George, our chances of getting out of  this are pretty slim. But it's up to  us. (a nod toward cabin) We can't have three hysterical people  on our hands. He enters the cabin through the cockpit. ? 497 ? INT. CABIN OF PLANE 94. MEDIUM SHOT As Conway enters, he is met by a volley  of questions. AD-LIB What do you say? What'd you find out? CONWAY (interrupting - cheerily) Everything's all right. The pilot won't  trouble us any more. He's - he's dead. This is met by a series of exclamations. AD-LIB Dead? How did it happen? CONWAY Probably a heart attack. BARNARD What are we going to do? CONWAY Well, there's nothing we can do until  the morning. 95. CLOSE SHOT Taking in George as he enters from cockpit.  His terror-stricken eyes look dully  before him. He stops in the doorway. CONWAY The storm will probably die down by  then. My suggestion is that we better  all try and get a good night's rest. 96. MEDIUM SHOT Over the shoulders of Gloria, Barnard  and Lovett as they face Conway, who  sits down. GEORGE (fiercely) Why don't you tell them the truth? 97. FULL SHOT They all wheel around and face George. GEORGE Why don't you tell them we're a million  miles from civilization, without a chance  of getting out of here alive? It's slow  starvation - that's what it is. It's  a slow, horrible death! When the significance of this outburst  finally sinks into the chaotic minds  of his listeners, they turn to Conway  hopefully, certain he will refute it.  But Conway looks beyond them at George.  From his noncommittal silence, they  realize that George's statement is the  truth. They slip into their seats. The  place is heavy with a fatalistic silence.  George slowly crosses to his seat near  Conway, avoiding his accusing eyes.  Suddenly the air is rent with harsh,  bitter laughter from Gloria. They all  look up. ? 498 ? GLORIA Well, that's perfect! Just perfect!  What a kick I'm going to get out of  this! She emits another outburst of semi-hysterical  laughter. 98. CLOSE SHOT - GROUP Favoring Gloria. The bitterness of a  lifetime in her voice. GLORIA (grimly satisfied) A year ago a doctor gave me six months  to live. That was a year ago! I'm already  six months to the good. I'm on velvet.[7]  I haven't got a thing to lose (semi-hysterical) But you! - you, the noble animals of  the human race, what a kick I'm going  to get out of watching you squirm for  a change. (her voice cracks completely) What a kick! She flops into her seat and buries her  head in her hands. For quite a while  all we hear are her stifled sobs. 99. CLOSE SHOT - CONWAY AND GEORGE George throws sidelong glances at his  brother, feeling his guilt. 100. FULL SHOT Shooting from front of plane, taking  in entire cabin. The only sound that  comes in on the tragic quiet is the  low moaning of the wind outside. A feeling  of doom has descended upon the five  people. FADE OUT: FADE IN 101. LONG SHOT Shooting toward the mountains which  seem to imprison the valley below. The  snowstorm, treacherous in its fury,  seems to threaten the valley with complete  obliteration. 102. MEDIUM SHOT Of the plane, tilted over on its side.  It is fully covered with snow. CAMERA  PANS UP TO LOVETT AND BARNARD, shivering  in their blankets as they pace worriedly. INTERIOR OF PLANE 103. MEDIUM SHOT George and Conway are missing. Lovett  turns from the window. LOVETT They've been gone for three hours. The others appear disinterested in this  observation. LOVETT Left us here to rot. That's what they've  done. Heroes of the newspapers! BARNARD All right, all right. Keep quiet. Lovett sees something through the window. ? 499 ? EXTERIOR OF PLANE 104. MEDIUM SHOT - THROUGH WINDOW OF  PLANE George and Conway are seen walking briskly  toward the plane, their few clothes  a scant protection against the biting  wind. INTERIOR PLANE 105. FULL SHOT LOVETT Here they come! The others quickly glance up, just as  Conway and George clamber aboard. Conway  has a serious mien, but George is full  of vigor and enthusiasm. GEORGE Hello, everybody. He holds out his hat which he has been  carrying, bottom side up. GEORGE Well, we found some food. Barnard and Lovett rush to him. GEORGE No chance of our starving now. When they see the contents of his hat,  their faces fall. LOVETT What is it? GEORGE Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here,  have some. I've read of people lasting  thirty days on this stuff. They grab handfuls. He goes on: GEORGE Listen, my brother and I have worked  out a plan. If we use our heads, we  should be able to keep alive for weeks,  until he gets back. LOVETT & BARNARD Gets back? Where's he going? GEORGE He doesn't know. But he's starting out  right away in the direction of India.  Sooner or later he's bound to run into  somebody - a tribe or something. BARNARD Yeah? 106. CLOSE SHOT - CONWAY Throughout the previous scene he has  been busily occupied making preparations.  Out of the baggage hold he has brought  some blankets and rope and has been  wrapping his feet in them. As George  speaks, he looks up and smiles. ? 500 ? GEORGE Now here's the idea. We found a cave  over by that small hill. After we bury  the pilot, we're moving in. We can have  a fire there. I shouldn't be surprised  to see Bob back within a week. Conway's smile dies on his face. We  get a feeling he is attempting a futile  journey, and is fully aware of it. He  resumes the roping of his feet - his  movements mechanical. 107. MED. CLOSE SHOT - GROUP Barnard and Lovett all attention as  George speaks. Gloria, off to one side,  has her eyes peeled on Conway intently. 108. CLOSE SHOT - GLORIA AND CONWAY GLORIA You haven't got a Chinaman's chance[8]  of getting out of this country alive,  and you know it. Conway stares at her blankly. BARNARD Cave, eh? Where? GEORGE (pointing) Over by that hill. Barnard peers out the plane window. BARNARD Hey - look! GEORGE Look, Bob! 109. FULL SHOT They all look up and glance out. EXTERIOR OF PLANE 110. LONG SHOT THROUGH WINDOW From their angle. In the distance, just  appearing over the top of a hill, we  see a caravan of natives approaching.  They are not close enough to distinguish  who or what they are, but that they  are human beings is apparent. INTERIOR PLANE 111. MEDIUM SHOT Conway takes in the unbelievable sight.  We hear the exultant exclamations of  the others. Barnard and Lovett start  out of the plane. LOVETT (looking around) Where are they? Do you see them? BARNARD Yes! LOVETT Do you think they're cannibals? ? 501 ? EXTERIOR OF PLANE 112. MEDIUM SHOT Where George, Lovett and Barnard wait,  a trifle awe-stricken. Conway joins  them. Gloria has stayed inside. 113. MED. LONG SHOT The approach of the caravan from the  viewpoint of the group. It comprises  some twenty Tibetans, attired in sheepskins,  fur, hats and boots. Somewhere in the  middle of the single file is Chang,  an elderly Chinese. Chang steps forward  as their leader. 114. MED. SHOT (MOVING) As Conway leaves his group and meets  the oncoming party. He approaches Chang  and bowing courteously, greets him in  Chinese. Chang turns his head slowly  and speaks in perfect Oxfordian English. CHANG I am from a nearby Lamasery. (holding out his hand) My name is Chang. 115. MEDIUM SHOT George, Barnard and Lovett. GEORGE Why, he's speaking English. LOVETT English! CONWAY (shaking hands) And mine's Conway. CHANG How do you do? CONWAY You've no idea, sir, how unexpected  and very welcome you are. My friends  and I - and the lady in the plane -  left Baskul night before last for Shanghai,  but we suddenly found ourselves travelling  in the opposite direction LOVETT At the mercy of a mad pilot. CONWAY We'd be eternally grateful if you CHANG (interrupting) Where is your mad pilot? CONWAY He must have had a heart attack, or  perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed  he was dead. GEORGE We were just going to bury him when  you came along. ? 502 ? CHANG (preoccupied) Pardon me Chang turns to some of his men and issues  an order in a foreign tongue, obviously  instructions to take care of the pilot. CONWAY (when Chang is through) So, if you will be good enough to direct  us to your Lamasery 116. MED. CLOSE SHOT - GROUP Favoring Chang. CHANG I shall consider it an honor to accompany  you and your friends. He issues a command to his men and turns  to Conway. CHANG You will need suitable clothes for the  journey. It is not particularly far,  but quite difficult. CONWAY Thank you. Several men have hopped into the scene  while he has been speaking. They come  forward with boots - sheepskins - fur  caps, etc. As they start to get into  these new clothes: DISSOLVE TO: 117. LONG SHOT As the caravan starts its journey back  up the hill. All five people are now  attired in their newly acquired outfit. 118. SERIES OF SHOTS Showing the party on various stages  of what looks like a humanly impossible  journey. We see them first climbing  - then across long vastnesses of flat  land. Each succeeding time we see them,  their feet drag more wearily. Their  breathing becomes more difficult. These  pictures finally DISSOLVE TO: EXT. NARROW TABLELAND 119. MED. LONG SHOT Halfway up a mountainside. The procession  is just starting around a hairpin curve.  They are forced to travel on a narrow  ledge overlooking a deep ravine. 120. CLOSE SHOT - LOVETT, BARNARD AND  GLORIA As they cling against the rocky sides  and glance apprehensively down into  the abyss below. 121. CLOSE SHOT - GLORIA Close by to Barnard. Gloria's face is  wan and haggard. Every upward move seems  to require a Herculean effort. She stops  and has a fit of coughing. ? 503 ? DISSOLVE TO: EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL 122. LONG SHOT Of the snake-like moving party. They  have reached quite a height although  the peak of the mountain they are ascending  towers high above them. The cutting  wind moans treacherously as it caroms  off the mountainside. A heavy mist envelops  them. 123. SERIES OF SHOTS As the snake-like line approaches a  narrow, treacherous footbridge and makes  a slow, difficult crossing in heavy  weather. EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP 124. MED. SHOT Of the group. They round a curve and  come upon a narrow crevice which opens  up into a passageway. One by one they  step through, assisted by the natives.  On the other side, they sigh relievedly.  Oddly, the wind has stopped, the chill  has lessened. They look up to inspect  their surroundings and a startled look  comes into their eyes. 124. MED. CLOSE SHOT Of Conway as he glances casually around.  What he sees leaves him transfixed.  He stares unbelievingly before him for  a long time. EXT. SHOT OF SHANGRI-LA 125. LONG SHOT From angle at mountain top. A sight that is both magnificent and  incredible. The eye-filling horizon  before them throws out a softness and  a warmth that is breathless. On the  left is a group of colored pavilions  that seem as if suspended on the mountainside.  Down below, in the hazy distance, is  a valley which gives one the impression  of a huge tapestry, superb in its blending  of soft colors. In every direction,  wherever one might gaze, there is a  feast of strange and heavenly beauty. 126. MED. CLOSE SHOT As Chang approaches Conway. CHANG Welcome to Shangri-La. EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP 127. MED. SHOT - GROUP Conway's group and Chang. Chang smiles  as he watches their astonished faces.  Conway turns from the rare magnificence  of Shangri-La, unhampered by the wind  and storm they had just encountered,  and looks backward, in the direction  from which they came to assure himself  he is the victim of a nightmare. Chang,  watching him, answers him before he  can express his astonishment. CHANG (a wave of his hand) You see, we are sheltered by mountains  on every side. A strange phenomena for  which we are very grateful. ? 504 ? DISSOLVE TO: EXT. A GARDEN 128. SERIES OF SHOTS As the group approaches the beautiful  and peaceful Shangri-La. 129. MED. SHOT At the foot of a wide marble stairway  as the caravan stops. LOVETT It's magic! 130. CLOSER SHOT On the group, as they look around and  feast their eyes on the grandeur of  the place. 131. CLOSE SHOT - CONWAY Glancing around at his picturesque surroundings. 132. PANNING SHOT Following Conway's gaze. In an upper  window of a tower, their faces glued  to the pane, are two robed Lamas who  stare down curiously. CAMERA PANS OVER  to a very narrow terrace covered almost  completely by a floral arbor. In it  stands a statuesque woman of rare beauty.  She looks down at Conway intently. 133. CLOSE SHOT - CONWAY As he returns her gaze, impressed by  her beauty. GEORGE'S VOICE Come along, Bob. Coming, Bob? 134. CLOSE SHOT - CONWAY His eyes still on the girl above. He  starts up the steps, staring at her,  then stumbles. 135. CLOSE SHOT - THE GIRL Laughing at his embarrassment. 136. CLOSE SHOT - CONWAY He smiles up at her. DISSOLVE TO: INT. A DINING ROOM 137. FULL SHOT It suggests nothing we might expect  to see in this forsaken place. The motif  is neither Oriental nor religious -  but rather a delicately appointed room,  subdued in tones. At the moment, no  one is present except servants who silently  set the table. INT. A CORRIDOR 138. MED. TRUCKING SHOT Of Lovett peering worriedly toward dining  room door. He sees two servants who  flank the entrance and steps back hesitantly.  Barnard emerges from a room across the  hall, and Lovett beckons to him. Both  are attired in flowing robes not unlike  the one worn by Chang. LOVETT Mr. Barnard, I do not like this place.  I definitely do not like this place. ? 505 ? BARNARD Will you stop squawking! LOVETT Look at me. Look at what they gave me  to wear. BARNARD You never looked better in your life.  As soon as our clothes are cleaned,  they're going to give them back to us,  Lovey. They have reached the doorway of the  dining room and halt. Two servants bow  and scrape and lead them in. BARNARD Something tells me this means food.  Come on! LOVETT I just feel as though I'm being made  ready for the executioner. INT. DINING ROOM 139. MEDIUM SHOT As the servants show Lovett and Barnard  to their places. BARNARD (taking in the food) Yeah? If this be execution, lead me  to it. LOVETT That's what they do with cattle just  before the slaughter. Fatten them. BARNARD Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey. LOVETT Please don't call me Lovey. At this moment Conway and George enter. CONWAY That was refreshing! Oh, ho - the food  looks good! He takes something off the table and  nibbles at it. BARNARD Some layout they got here. Did you get  a load of the rooms? You couldn't do  better at the Ritz. LOVETT All the conveniences for the condemned,  if you ask me. Conway looks at him and smiles. BARNARD Don't mind Lovey. He's got the misery. LOVETT Mr. Conway, I don't like this place.  I don't like it. It's too mysterious. ? 506 ? CONWAY It's better than freezing to death down  below, isn't it? BARNARD I'll say. INT. GLORIA'S ROOM[ 9] 140. FULL SHOT It is in semi-darkness. The moon sends  a stream of light through the windows.  Outside we see the outline of towering  mountains. Spread across the bed - her  clothes unchanged - is the body of Gloria  - her face sunk deep in the pillows. 141. MED. CLOSE SHOT Gloria emits wracking coughs. After  a few moments - she sits up. Her cheeks  are wet - her hair disheveled - her  eyes bloodshot. We get an impression  of someone who has suffered for hours.  Finally, her coughing begins again -  and unable to stand it, she rises and  paces the floor - then she crosses to  the window and looks down, CAMERA PANNING  WITH HER - and into her eyes has come  a grim, determined expression. 142. LONG SHOT From Gloria's point of view. She is staring at the chasm below her. CONTINUATION SCENE 141 Gloria continues to peer below - and  her coughing resumes. INT. CORRIDOR 143. MEDIUM SHOT As Chang comes down the corridor - hears  the coughing and stops. INT. GLORIA'S ROOM 144. FULL SHOT Chang enters and watches Gloria for  a moment before speaking. CHANG Is there something I can do for you? Gloria wheels around and glares at him. GLORIA What do you want? CHANG I've offered you some warm broth. I  thought perhaps- GLORIA You get out of here! If any of you men  think you can come busting in here- She cannot finish as she is attacked  by a fit of coughing. CHANG Please calm yourself. You'll soon be  well if you do. GLORIA (through fits of coughing) I don't need any advice from you! Get  me a doctor! ? 507 ? CHANG I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here. GLORIA (looks up quickly) No doctors? (bitterly) That's fine. That's just fine. CHANG Please let me help you. GLORIA Sure, you can help me! You can help  me jump over that cliff! I've been looking  and looking at the bottom of that mountain,  but I haven't got the nerve to jump! CHANG (quietly) You shouldn't be looking at the bottom  of the mountain. Why don't you try looking  up at the top sometimes? GLORIA (her voice cracking) Don't preach that cheap, second-hand  stuff to me! (a sob escapes) Go on, beat it. Beat it! She flings herself across the bed, coughing  uncontrollably. Chang watches her sympathetically  for a few seconds. CHANG (before turning away) Peace be with you, my child. INT. DINING ROOM 145. FULL SHOT They all look up as Chang enters. He  is escorted to his place at the head  of the table by two servants who stand  on either side of his chair. CHANG (jovially) Good evening. Good evening, my friends.  Oh no, no, no, please sit down. I hope  you found everything satisfactory. BARNARD & CONWAY Swell. Excellent. CHANG (sees that no one has started) You shouldn't have waited for me. BARNARD Where's the girl? Miss Stone. ? 508 ? CHANG She's remaining in her room. She isn't  feeling very well. (to others) Now please go on without me. I eat very  little. 146. MEDIUM SHOT Shooting down the long table toward  Chang. He sits up straight - studying  them - as the others bend over their  food. DISSOLVE TO: INT. DINING ROOM 147. MEDIUM SHOT The meal is over. Conway sips from a  wine glass. BARNARD Well, there's certainly nothing wrong  with that meal! CHANG Thank you. CONWAY And the wine - excellent. CHANG I'm glad you like it. It's made right  here in the valley. LOVETT Now that dinner is over, if you'll excuse  us, we're very anxious to discuss ways  and means of getting back home. GEORGE The first thing we want to do is to  cable the Foreign Office. All of England  is waiting to hear about my brother.  There's a cruiser at Shanghai ready  to take him back. CHANG Really? Well, as regards cabling, I'm  afraid I can't help. Unfortunately,  we have no wireless here. As a matter  of fact, we have no means of communication  with the outside world. George stares at him suspiciously -  and then turns to Conway for his reaction  - but Conway is apparently disinterested  in the whole conversation. BARNARD Not even a radio? CHANG It's always been a source of deep regret,  but the mountains surrounding us have  made reception almost impossible. ? 509 ? GEORGE In that event, we better make arrangements  to get some porters immediately. Some  means to get us back to civilization. CHANG Are you so certain you are away from  it? GEORGE As far away as I ever want to be. CHANG Oh, dear. LOVETT Of course, the porters will be very  well paid - that is, within reason. CHANG I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see,  we have no porters here. LOVETT No porters here!! CHANG No. BARNARD What about those men we met this morning? CHANG Yes. Those are our own people. They  never venture beyond the point where  you were met this morning. It is much  too hazardous. 148. CLOSE SHOT - CONWAY To intercut with above speech. He has remained quiet throughout the  scene, apparently interested only in  a paper in front of him, upon which  he has been writing. INSERT: What has been occupying Conway's  interest. It is a picture of Chang which  he has been listlessly drawing. BARNARD How do you account for all this? Who  brought it in? 149. FULL SHOT They all turn to Chang expectantly. CHANG Oh, yes. There is a tribe of porters  some five hundred miles from here. That  is our only contact with the outside  world. Every now and again, depending  upon favorable weather of course, they  make the journey. GEORGE How can we get in touch with them? ? 510 ? CHANG In that respect, you are exceedingly  fortunate. We are expecting a shipment  from them almost any time now LOVETT What exactly do you mean by \"almost  any time now\"? CHANG Well, we've been expecting this particular  shipment for the past two years. BARNARD Two years!? CHANG Yes. Barnard and Lovett look shocked. George  starts to say something, but the words  choke in his throat. CHANG But I can assure you, gentlemen, if  there is a prolonged delay, Shangri-La  will endeavor to make your stay as pleasant  as possible. (rising) And now if you will excuse me, it is  getting late. I do hope you all sleep  well. Good night. The servants move his chair back. Before  he goes, however, he turns to Conway. CHANG Good night, Mr. Conway. Conway, a little surprised at the distinction  in his behalf, nods. CONWAY Good night, sir. Chang exits. There is a hushed silence  following Chang's departure. LOVETT That's what I mean - mysterious. Mr.  Conway, I don't like that man. He's  too vague. GEORGE (concerned) We didn't get much information out of  him, did we Bob? CONWAY It seems to me we should be grateful.  We were in a bad mess this morning. (a wave of his hand) After all, this is quite pleasant. Why  not make ourselves comfortable until  the porters do arrive? While he was speaking, the muted strains  of a violin float into the room. Conway  rises. ? 511 ? 150. MEDIUM SHOT As Conway crosses to a balcony door. BARNARD That's what I say. What do you say to  a rubber of bridge? I saw some cards  in the other room. CONWAY Not for me, thanks. No, I'm too weary. He disappears onto the balcony. George  watches him go. BARNARD (slightly effeminate) How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's  you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge. LOVETT (distractedly) I'm thinking. BARNARD Thinking? What about some double solitaire? LOVETT As a matter of fact, I'm very good at  double solitaire. BARNARD No kidding? LOVETT Yes. BARNARD Then I'm your man. (starts away) Come on, Toots. Lovett detests the pet names, but follows.  George thinks a moment - and crosses  to balcony. EXT. BALCONY 151. MEDIUM SHOT Conway is listening moodily to the soulful  music. George wanders in beside him. CONWAY Hello, George. (looking out) Cigarette? GEORGE Thanks. (lights the cigarette - after a pause) I suppose all this comes under the heading  of adventure. CONWAY We've had plenty of it the last few  days. ? 512 ? GEORGE It's far from over, from what I can  see. This place gives me the creeps,  hidden away like this - no contact with  civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned  at all. CONWAY Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to  be concerned about anything. (moodily) I think I'm going to like it here. GEORGE You talk as though you intend on staying. CONWAY (turns to him) Something happened to me, when we arrived  here, George, that - well - did you  ever go to a totally strange place,  and feel certain that you've been there  before? GEORGE What are you talking about? CONWAY (back to earth) I don't know. GEORGE You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford  calls you the man who always wanted  to see what was on the other side of  the hill. 152. TWO SHOT - CONWAY AND GEORGE Conway's point of view, studying George. CONWAY Don't you ever want to see what's on  the other side of the hill? GEORGE What could there be except just another  hill? In any event, I'm not curious.  At the moment, it seems to me we should  be concerned about getting home. I'd  give anything to be in London right  now. CONWAY Of course you would. If ever we get  out of this place, the thing for you  to do is to take that job with Helen's  father. GEORGE What do you mean if we should get out? CONWAY (evasively) Did I say \"if\"? ? 513 ? GEORGE (interrupting) That's what you said. CONWAY Well - I mean GEORGE What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as  though we're going to have trouble getting  out of here. 153. CLOSE TWO SHOT - FAVORING CONWAY CONWAY George, I've been putting things together.  Do you notice the resemblance between  those natives and the pilot? And why  did those clothes materialize so conveniently  when they met us at the plane? Chang  himself just said that they never venture  beyond that point. What brought them  there? Unless it was to meet us? GEORGE (catching on) Chang's first question was about the  pilot. CONWAY Uh-huh. GEORGE There must be some connection between  the plane and this place. They must  have deliberately brought us here. Why,  Bob? What reason could they have for  doing a thing like that? CONWAY That's what's on the other side of the  hill. FADE OUT: FADE IN EXT. OF VALLEY - DAY 154. LONG SHOT FROM A TOWER ROOM Shooting over shoulders of two men in  f.g. We see a beautiful picture of the valley  below. There is a tranquility here that  is beatific. CAMERA PULLS BACK. The  two men are revealed as Conway and Chang.  They stand on a terrace of one of the  tower rooms. CHANG It's three thousand feet, practically  straight down to the floor of the valley.  The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call  it. There are over two thousand people  in the Valley besides those here in  Shangri-La. CONWAY Who and what is Shangri-La? You? CHANG Goodness, no! CHANG So there are others? ? 514 ? CHANG Oh, yes. CONWAY Who, for instance? CHANG In time you will meet them all. 155. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO - FAVORING  CONWAY He watches Chang's face searchingly,  then smiles. CONWAY For a man who talks a great deal, it's  amazing how unenlightening you can be. CHANG (laughs) There are some things, my dear Conway,  I deeply regret I may not discuss. CONWAY You know, that's the fourth time you've  said that today. You should have a record  made of it. CHANG (evasively) Shall we go inside? I should so like  to show you some of our rare treasures. INT. A TOWER 156. FOLLOW SHOT WITH GEORGE On a spiral staircase. Looking surreptitiously  around, he backs his way up. CAMERA  FOLLOWS HIM as he reaches the top of  the landing. Here he stops and glances  around the corner down a corridor. INT. CORRIDOR 157. MEDIUM SHOT CAMERA FOLLOWS GEORGE as he peers into  several rooms searchingly. He finally  arrives at one and enters. INT. A ROOM 158. FULL SHOT George enters and looks around. It is  dimly lit and apparently unoccupied.  He crosses to a desk and picks up several  objects, scrutinizing them closely. 159. CLOSE SHOT OF THE GIRL, MARIA -  IN ALCOVE She sits, a tapestry board on her lap,  watching George with keen interest. 160. CLOSE SHOT - GEORGE He opens a book and glances at its contents. 161. MED. SHOT TO INCLUDE BOTH Maria surveys his back appraisingly. MARIA Good afternoon. George wheels around, startled, and  stares at her intently. ? 515 ? GEORGE (starts backing out) Excuse me MARIA (appealingly) Please don't go. George hesitates at door. MARIA Tea will be served any moment. 162. CLOSE SHOT - GEORGE He watches her with grave speculation  for a long moment, then slowly moves  toward her. MARIA (a winning smile) Won't you come in? George still maintains a serious mien,  as their eyes meet. MARIA My name is Maria. Won't you sit down? INT. LIBRARY 163. FULL SHOT It is a huge room. The walls are lined  with impressive tomes. Chang is showing  Conway around. 164. MEDIUM SHOT Conway has just finished browsing through  one of the books. CONWAY By the way, what religion do you follow  here? CHANG We follow many. A look of surprise spreads over Conway's  face. CHANG (thoughtfully) To put it simply, I should say that  our general belief was in moderation.  We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses  of every kind, even including (he smiles) the excess of virtue itself. 165. CLOSER SHOT - THE TWO CONWAY That's intelligent. CHANG We find, in the Valley, it makes for  better happiness among the natives.  We rule with moderate strictness and  in return we are satisfied with moderate  obedience. As a result, our people are  moderately honest and moderately chaste  and somewhat more than moderately happy. ? 516 ? CONWAY How about law and order? You have no  soldiers or police? CHANG Oh, good heavens, no! CONWAY How do you deal with incorrigibles?  Criminals? CHANG Why, we have no crime here. What makes  a criminal? Lack, usually. Avariciousness,  envy, the desire to possess something  owned by another. There can be no crime  where there is a sufficiency of everything. CONWAY You have no disputes over women? CHANG Only very rarely. You see, it would  not be considered good manners to take  a woman that another man wanted. CONWAY Suppose somebody wanted her so badly  that he didn't give a hang if it was  good manners or not? CHANG (smiling) Well, in that event, it would be good  manners on the part of the other man  to let him have her. 166. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO - FAVORING  CONWAY CONWAY That's very convenient. I think I'd  like that. CHANG You'd be surprised, my dear Conway,  how a little courtesy all around helps  to smooth out the most complicated problems. 167. MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO Chang smiles. Conway scarcely hears  the last speech, for his attention has  been caught by the playing of a piano.  He stops to listen. Chang has walked  out of scene. 168. MEDIUM SHOT Conway locates the direction whence  the music comes, goes to a doorway where  he stops. 169. CLOSE SHOT - CHANG He realizes Conway did not follow him  and turns. When he sees Conway, his  face clouds - and he starts toward him. 170. CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR Conway watches someone through door  with grave interest. Chang enters scene  and follows his gaze. ? 517 ? INT. MUSIC ROOM 171. FULL SHOT From doorway. It is a spacious, high-ceilinged  room, oddly shaped, and except for a  piano, a harp and several chairs, is  otherwise sparsely furnished. At the  extreme end, the room is set off by  an alcove of stained glass extending  from the ceiling to the floor, where  it finishes with a deep window seat.  At the piano we see an old man - and  by his side is the girl Conway saw last  night. They finish playing and both  laugh heartily. 172. CLOSE SHOT AT DOORWAY Conway finds her laughter infectious  - and smiles. 173. CLOSE SHOT - GIRL AND MAN AT PIANO In the midst of her laughter, the girl  sees Conway, off scene, and her face  sobers - self-consciously. 174. CLOSE SHOT AT DOORWAY Chang quickly takes Conway by the arm. CHANG At some time in the future you will  have the pleasure of meeting her. Conway turns for one last glimpse of  the girl, and then turns to Chang, looking  up at his face, puzzled and amused. CONWAY Some man had better get ready to be  very courteous to me. 175. CLOSEUP - THE GIRL She continues to stare off toward the  door, her eyes alight with a keen interest. DISSOLVE TO: INT. CORRIDOR 176. FOLLOW SHOT WITH CONWAY AND CHANG CONWAY But Mr. Chang, all these things - books,  instruments, sculpture - do you mean  to say they were all brought in over  those mountains by porters? CHANG They were. CONWAY Well, it must have taken CHANG Centuries. CONWAY Centuries! Where did you get the money  to pay for all those treasures? CHANG Of course we have no money as you know  it. We do not buy or sell or seek personal  fortunes because, well, because there  is no uncertain future here for which  to accumulate it. ? 518 ? INT. A ROOM 177. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO They have arrived in a small room, where  they pause. Chang reaches into a bowl  of large nuts, cracks one, and hands  the nut to Conway. Then he does the  same for himself. During the following  scene, both are eating nuts from the  bowl. CONWAY That would suit me perfectly. I'm always  broke. How did you pay for them? CHANG Our Valley is very rich in a metal called  gold, which fortunately for us is valued  very highly in the outside world. So  we merely . . . CONWAY buy and sell? CHANG Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange  . CONWAY (chuckling) I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr.  Chang, there's something so simple and  naive about all of this that I suspect  there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence  somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did  it all start? CHANG That, my dear Conway, is the story of  a remarkable man. CONWAY Who? CHANG A Belgian priest by the name of Father  Perrault, the first European to find  this place, and a very great man indeed.  He is responsible for everything you  see here. He built Shangri-La, taught  our natives, and began our collection  of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father  Perrault. CONWAY When was all this? CHANG Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I  think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled  into the Valley, half frozen to death.  It was typical of the man that, one  leg being frozen, and of course there  being no doctors here, he amputated  the leg himself. CONWAY (shocked) He amputated his own leg? ? 519 ? CHANG Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had  learned to understand their language,  the natives told him he could have saved  his leg. It would have healed without  amputation. CONWAY Well, they didn't actually mean that. CHANG Yes, yes. They were very sincere about  it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect  health is the rule here. They've never  known anything different. So what was  true for them they thought would naturally  be true for anyone else living here. CONWAY Well, is it? CHANG Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly  so in the case of Father Perrault himself.  Do you know when he and the natives  were finished building Shangri-La, he  was 108 years old and still very active,  in spite of only having one leg? CONWAY 108 and still active? CHANG You're startled? CONWAY Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's  all. CHANG Forgive me. I should have told you it  is quite common here to live to a very  ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain  water, you might say. But we like to  believe it is the absence of struggle  in the way we live. In your countries,  on the other hand, how often do you  hear the expression, \"He worried himself  to death?\" or, \"This thing or that killed  him?\" CONWAY Very often. CHANG And very true. Your lives are therefore,  as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural  death as by indirect suicide. CONWAY (after a pause) That's all very fine if it works out.  A little amazing, of course. ? 520 ? CHANG Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me! CONWAY I surprise you? Now that's news. CHANG I mean, your amazement. I could have  understood it in any of your companions,  but you - who have dreamed and written  so much about better worlds. Or is it  that you fail to recognize one of your  own dreams when you see it? CONWAY Mr. Chang, if you don't mind, I think  I'll go on being amazed - in moderation,  of course. CHANG (chuckles) Then everything is quite all right,  isn't it? They exit scene together. EXT. GARDEN[10] 178. MED. CLOSE SHOT On a garden bench Gloria slumps languidly.  Suddenly we hear Barnard's voice, yelling.  Gloria quickly turns her back. Barnard  runs into scene. BARNARD Honey, it's terrific! Terrific! I just  saw something that will make your hair  stand on end. You see those hills over  there? Gold! Gold! Popping right out  of them! Tons of it! (conspiratorially) Now look, you keep this under your hat,  because if those other monkeys hear  about it, they'll declare themselves  in. But if I can mine that stuff, I'll  throw a bombshell into Wall Street.  Now look, I've got a plan - and if I Gloria begins coughing heavily. Barnard  notices how pale and haggard she looks. BARNARD Aw say, honey, you aren't feeling well,  are you? Look, don't pay too much attention  to what those doctors tell you. I've  seen an awful lot of people fool them,  and I've got a hunch that this place  is going to be good for you. Honest,  I have. (waits for her reaction - receives none) Come on now. Come on. You be a good  kid, and snap out of it, and I'll cut  you in on the gold deal. Look, I'm going  up and make a deal with Chang - right  now. He enthusiastically exits scene. INT. LOVETT'S ROOM 179. CLOSE SHOT Lovett enters warily, sits down at his  desk and begins to write in his journal. ? 521 ? INSERT OF WHAT HE WRITES: THE DIARY OF ALEXANDER P. LOVETT 2nd Day at Shangri-La \"This place is too mysterious!\" He looks up, sees himself in a mirror  and gives a start. Then, chuckling to  himself reassuringly, he looks around  warily and continues to write. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. SOMEWHERE IN SHANGRI-LA 180. FULL SHOT It is a bright, cheery morning. Conway  is drinking in the beauty of his surroundings.  He comes into the area where the horses  are stabled. Two men are busily grooming  the horses. CONWAY (cheerily) Good morning! MEN Good morning, Mr. Conway! CONWAY Oh, you speak English, do you? MEN Yes, sir. ONE OF THE MEN Would you like to take a ride, Mr. Conway? CONWAY No, thanks. Not just now. Suddenly, Conway is startled by the  sound of hoof-beats and, looking up,  is in time to see 'the girl' of the  previous sequence (Sondra) fly by him  on a horse - screaming delightedly.  As she passes him, she waves. CONWAY (instantly changing his mind) Well, I think I will take that ride! 181. MED. SHOT - CONWAY As he rides off in pursuit of her. 182. SEVERAL SHOTS OF THE CHASE Showing Sondra successfully eluding  him - as he closes in on her. 183. MED. LONG SHOT - BOTTOM OF A HILL Sondra whizzes by. As we stay on the  shot - Conway rides through in exciting  pursuit. 184. ANOTHER ANGLE Showing Sondra disappearing behind a  mountain waterfall. Conway dashes up,  but she is lost from sight. He wheels  around several times - and unable to  find her, looks puzzled. Finally, giving  up, he starts slowly back. After a few  moments he is startled by her laughter,  and glances around. ? 522 ? 185. LONG SHOT From his view - shooting upward. High  up - near the summit of the hill - we  see Sondra - waving and laughing. Then  she swings her horse around and disappears. 186. CLOSEUP - CONWAY As he smiles - amused and interested. DISSOLVE TO: 187. LONG SHOT - SONDRA As she swims in a mountain stream, apparently  in the buff. From a distance, we see  her climb onto a rock to dry off. 188. CLOSEUP - SONDRA As she shakes her shimmering hair. 189. MEDIUM SHOT - CONWAY He has caught up to her tethered horse  and is skulking around trying to find  out where she is. 190. CLOSE SHOT - A SQUIRREL A squirrel, near to Sondra, chatters  excitedly. 191. CLOSE SHOT - SONDRA She can apparently understand the squirrel's  warning. She hurries to dive back into  the water and swim to the other side.  She comes up, spots Conway and watches  him from hiding, behind some bushes. 192. MEDIUM SHOT - CONWAY Conway has discovered her clothing and  is constructing a kind of scarecrow  on a bush out of them. As a crowning  touch, he adds a flower to the effigy,  his eyes twinkling at his little joke.  With one final glance over his shoulder,  he turns to leave. 193. CLOSE SHOT - SONDRA She stifles her laughter as he vanishes  from view. DISSOLVE TO: INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT 194. FULL SHOT Lovett and Barnard are at the table  waiting for the others. Several servants  are in the b.g. George paces nervously  in front of the door. 195. MED. SHOT AT TABLE Lovett and Barnard. Barnard nibbles  at something. BARNARD Bah! Fossils! Why? What for? Running  around digging up a lot of old bones!  You didn't dig yourself out of one of  those holes by any chance, did you? Lovett is about to reply, when he realizes  he is being made fun of, and gives a  tentative chuckle. INT. CORRIDOR 196. MEDIUM SHOT Conway is coming down the corridor.  George comes out of door to dining room  and starts forward. Conway walks along  in a cheerful mood, singing as he goes,  a Cockney song. ? 523 ? GEORGE (forces a smile) You seem gay. Did you find out anything? 197. CLOSE TRUCKING SHOT WITH THEM As they walk back toward dining room  door. CONWAY Well - I heard that if you want a man's  wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners. GEORGE Nothing about the porters yet? CONWAY Porters? GEORGE Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two  weeks and we haven't found out a thing. CONWAY Well, we haven't been murdered in our  beds yet, George, have we? GEORGE I'm afraid the porters are just a myth. (tensely) I guess we never will know why we're  here, or how long we're going to be  held prisoners. CONWAY Shhh! They have reached the door and start  into dining room. INT. DINING ROOM 198. MEDIUM SHOT As Conway and George enter, Barnard  calls to them: BARNARD Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm  starved! CONWAY (imitating Chang as he takes his chair) Please! Please! Do not wait for me!  I eat so very little. Barnard laughs heartily. George, surily  silent, enters and drops in his seat.  At the same moment, Gloria comes into  the room. GLORIA Good evening. The men greet her, all rising. BARNARD Well, I'm certainly glad to see that  it's all finally organized. (to servant) Okay, handsome. Dish it out, and make  it snappy. As he sits, he looks over at Gloria  and something in her face arrests him. ? 524 ? BARNARD Hey, what's happened to you? GLORIA (self-consciously) Nothing. Why? BARNARD Why, you look beautiful. CONWAY That's unkind. Doesn't Miss Stone always  look beautiful? 199. MED. CLOSE SHOT AT TABLE Featuring Gloria, Barnard and Conway. BARNARD (suddenly) I got it! It's your make-up. You've  got none on. Gloria busies herself with her soup,  self-consciously. BARNARD And say, honey, you look a million per  cent better. Wholesome, kind of - and  clean. You take a tip from me, and don't  you ever put that stuff on your face  again. Why, it's like hiding behind  a mask. LOVETT Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about  a mask? What do you mean? You've been  wearing a mask ever since we met you. BARNARD Have I? LOVETT It's very strange, you know. You've  never told us anything about yourself.  Who are you, anyway? Why don't you take  your mask off for once! CONWAY (lightly) Yes. Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.[11] BARNARD (his face has become serious) All right, I will! I'll let my hair  down! Why not? It can't make any real  difference now. (after a pause) Hey Lovey, were you ever chased by the  police? Lovett is halted in his tracks - soup  spoon halfway up to his mouth. LOVETT Certainly not. ? 525 ? 200. CLOSE SHOT - BARNARD BARNARD Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas  picked me up at Baskul, they'd been  on my tail for a year. LOVETT (skeptical) The police? BARNARD Uh-huh. (after another pause) Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant? CAMERA PULLS BACK to include the others.  They look shocked. CONWAY (the first one to make the connection) Chalmers Bryant! BARNARD Bryant's Utilities - that's me. George is the only one unconcerned.  He is deeply absorbed in thought - his  food has remained untouched. Lovett  suddenly explodes. LOVETT I knew it. I knew I had a reason for  hating you! Sir, you're a thief. GLORIA He never stole anything from you , did  he? LOVETT I have 500 shares of Bryant Utilities  that I bought with money that I saved  for 20 years teaching school, and now  I couldn't sell it for postage stamps. 201. MED. SHOT - GROUP Featuring Barnard. BARNARD That's too bad. I got a half million  shares. My whole foundation! And now  look at me! LOVETT A colossal nerve you have sitting there  and talking about it so calmly - you,  the swindler of thousands of people BARNARD You know, that's what makes the whole  thing so funny. A guy like me starts  out in life as a plumber - an ordinary,  everyday, slew-footed[12] plumber -  and by the use of a little brains, mind  you, he builds up a gigantic institution,  employs thousands of people, becomes  a great civic leader. And then the crash  comes - and overnight he's the biggest  crook the country ever had. ? 526 ? LOVETT You are a thief, sir, and a swindler,  and I, for one, will be only too glad  to turn you over to the police when  we get back. George can't stand it any longer. GEORGE (suddenly - hoarsely) What do you mean - \"when we get back\"? The sharpness of his voice startles  the others. GEORGE What makes you think we're ever going  to get back? You may not know it, but  you're all prisoners here. We were deliberately  kidnapped and brought here - and nobody  knows why He rises to his feet. GEORGE Well, I'm not content to be a prisoner.  I'm going to find out when we're going  to get out of this place. (whips out a revolver; grimly) I'll make that Chinese talk if it's  the last thing I do! He starts out. 202. MEDIUM SHOT Before anybody can realize what his  intentions are, he has bolted out of  the room. CONWAY (calling) George! Starts after him. INT. CORRIDOR 203. MEDIUM SHOT As George strides determinedly out into  the hall, yelling. GEORGE Chang! Chang! Suddenly he sees a native servant and  his eyes pop insanely. CAMERA PANS WITH  HIM as he strides across to the servant  and grabs him by the shirt-front. GEORGE (shaking servant violently) Where is he? Where's Chang? Where is  he? Where's Chang, or I'll blow your  brains out! Conway has caught up with him and wrestles  him away from the servant, who stumbles  off in fright. CONWAY George, what do you think you're doing? ? 527 ? GEORGE Let me go, Bob! George pushes Conway away from him and  starts down the corridor. CONWAY George, come back! GEORGE Chang! Chang! Chang! George spies another servant. GEORGE Come here, you! Come here! The servant, frightened by his voice,  turns suddenly and starts running. George  levels his revolver and sends a stream  of bullets after the fleeing servant,  who miraculously manages to skate around  a corner, unharmed. Conway runs into  scene, reaching George, and with a quick  flip of his left hand he smacks him  over his revolver arm - and with his  right, he punches him flush on the jaw. CONWAY George, you idiot! George reels for a moment and slumps  to the floor. 204. CLOSE SHOT As the others trail in. BARNARD Had to sock him, eh? Conway pockets the gun and, bending  over George, a pained expression on  his face, starts to lift him. DISSOLVE TO: INT. CONWAY'S ROOM 205. MED. CLOSE SHOT Conway brings George in, followed by  the others. He drapes him across his  bed. Conway stands by his side, looking  down at him, deeply concerned. After  a moment, Conway shakes him and George  awakens with a start. GEORGE Let me up! Let me up! CONWAY All right. Sorry, George. George groans and turns away. 206. MED. SHOT TOWARD DOOR On Barnard, Lovett and Gloria. Barnard  wanders over to Conway, who appears  lost in thought. BARNARD Say Conway, is it true about us being  kidnapped? Conway shrugs. ? 528 ? BARNARD (louder) I say, is it true about us being kidnapped? Conway suddenly is aroused from his  reverie by someone he sees off scene.  He looks up alertly. CONWAY Mr. Chang! Chang enters scene, beaming charmingly. CONWAY Do you mind stepping in here for a moment? 207. FULL SHOT As Chang enters. He bows courteously  to the others, who stand in front of  George's bed. Conway shuts the door  and turns the key. He crosses to a door  leading to another room - and locks  this one, also. Chang watches him curiously.  The others, including George, who is  now alert, are puzzled and somewhat  impressed. Then Conway comes to Chang. CONWAY Won't you sit down? Chang sits, his placidity unchanged.  Conway pulls up a chair in front of  him. CONWAY (very quietly) Mr. Chang, you have been very kind to  us - and we appreciate it. But for some  reason we are being held prisoners here,  and we want to know why. 208. CLOSE SHOT - BARNARD, LOVETT AND  GLORIA As Conway's voice continues, talking  to Chang: CONWAY Personally, I don't mind at all. I'm  enjoying every minute of it. (dead serious) But my brother is not of the same opinion,  nor are the others. (after a pause) It's time we were told what it's all  about. 209. MED. SHOT - GROUP Conway still continuing: CONWAY We want to know why we were kidnapped,  why we are being kept here, but most  important of all - do we get the porters,  and when? (much too suavely) Until we get this information, my dear  Mr. Chang, I am very much afraid we  cannot permit you to leave this room. There is a pause while the eyes of all  are centered on Chang's face. ? 529 ? CHANG (after a pause) You know, it's very, very strange, but  when you saw me in the corridor, I was  actually on my way to you. I bring the  most amazing news. (impressively) The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr.  Conway. LOVETT The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?! BARNARD Yeah. I though you ran this joint. CONWAY Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas,  do we get the porters? CHANG The High Lama is the only one from whom  any information can come. GEORGE Don't believe him, Bob. He's just trying  to get out. LOVETT Yes. BARNARD Sounds like a stall to me. CONWAY One moment. You say the High Lama is  the only one who can give us any information? CHANG The only one. CONWAY And he can arrange for the porters to  take us back? CHANG The High Lama arranges everything, Mr.  Conway. CONWAY Well, then he's the man I want to see. (to Chang) Will you come along? Conway unlocks the door. When he has  opened it, he turns. CONWAY Better wait here until I get back. We'll  soon know where we stand. INT. CORRIDOR IN HIGH LAMA'S QUARTERS 210. MED. TRUCKING SHOT With Conway and Chang. Chang walks in  a high state of expectancy. Conway is  grim. They climb a narrow spiral staircase. ? 530 ? 211. MED. CLOSE SHOT They proceed up the stairs until they  arrive at a large, impressively ornate  double door which seems to open automatically  the moment they approach. Chang remains  without. The moment Conway steps over  the threshold, the doors swing closed. INT. HIGH LAMA'S CHAMBER[ 13] 212. MED. SHOT As the doors swing shut. Conway turns  and realizes Chang is no longer with  him. 213. CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR Conway stands still, glancing around  the room, which is lit so dimly that  nothing definite is distinguishable. 214. FULL SHOT To show what Conway sees. For the moment,  practically nothing. As his eyes become  adjusted to the darkness, he begins  to sense the architecture and furnishings  of the room. But as yet no sign of life.  SLOW PAN SHOT reveals it to be a dark-curtained  and low-ceilinged room, furnished rather  simply. Very sombre, indistinct tapestries  drape the back walls. While the CAMERA  FOLLOWS CONWAY'S GAZE, MOVING SLOWLY  AROUND, a voice is heard. HIGH LAMA'S VOICE (soft and friendly) Good evening, Mr. Conway. CAMERA QUICKLY SWINGS OVER to the nethermost  corner of the room where, scarcely visible,  sits an old man of indeterminate age.  In the gloom only the outlines of his  pale and wrinkled face can be seen.  It yields an effect of a fading antique  portrait. 215. CLOSE SHOT - CONWAY He stares, motionless, at the eerie  vision. 216. MED. SHOT OF ROOM HIGH LAMA Please come in. Conway comes forward warily until he  stands within a few feet of the old  man, his eyes riveted upon him. HIGH LAMA Sit here, near me. I am an old man and  can do no one any harm. CONWAY Are you the High Lama? HIGH LAMA Yes. 217. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO As Conway, expressionless, sits down  opposite the High Lama. HIGH LAMA I trust you have been comfortable at  Shangri-La, since your arrival. ? 531 ? CONWAY Personally, I've enjoyed your community  very much. But my friends do not care  for this mystery. They are determined  to leave as soon as While he has been speaking, his eyes  have been gradually taking in the details  of the old man. The CAMERA QUICKLY FOLLOWS  HIS GAZE - to crutches leaning against  the man's throne - then, looking down,  to his legs, one of which appears to  have been amputated. 218. CLOSEUP - CONWAY CONWAY (awe and amazement) It's astonishing - and incredible, but 219. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO HIGH LAMA What is it, my son? CONWAY You're the man Chang told me about!  You're the first - who - two hundred  years ago (reverently) you're still alive, Father Perrault! HIGH LAMA Sit down, my son. (pause) You may not know it, but I've been an  admirer of yours for a great many years. Conway evinces surprise. HIGH LAMA Oh, not of Conway the empire-builder  and public hero. I wanted to meet the  Conway who in one of his books, said,  \"There are moments in every man's life  when he glimpses the eternal.\" The quotation captures Conway's interest  - and his eyes widen. HIGH LAMA That Conway seemed to belong here. In  fact, it was suggested that someone  be sent to bring him here. CONWAY That I be brought here? Who had that  brilliant idea? HIGH LAMA Sondra Bizet. CONWAY (secretly pleased) Oh, the girl at the piano? HIGH LAMA Yes. She has read your books and has  a profound admiration for you, as have  we all. ? 532 ? CONWAY Of course I have suspected that our  being here is no accident. Furthermore,  I have a feeling that we're never supposed  to leave. But that, for the moment,  doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet  that when it comes. What particularly  interests me at present is, why was  I brought here? What possible use can  I be to an already thriving community? HIGH LAMA We need men like you here, to be sure  that our community will continue to  thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La  has much to give you. You are still,  by the world's standards, a youngish  man. Yet in the normal course of existence,  you can expect twenty or thirty years  of gradually diminishing activity. Here,  however, in Shangri-La, by our standards  your life has just begun, and may go  on and on. CONWAY But to be candid, Father, a prolonged  future doesn't excite me. It would have  to have a point. I've sometimes doubted  whether life itself has any. And if  that is so, then long life must be even  more pointless. No, I'd need a much  more definite reason for going on and  on. HIGH LAMA We have reason. It is the entire meaning  and purpose of Shangri-La. It came to  me in a vision, long, long, ago. I saw  all the nations strengthening, not in  wisdom, but in the vulgar passions and  the will to destroy. I saw their machine  power multiply until a single weaponed  man might match a whole army. I foresaw  a time when man, exulting in the technique  of murder, would rage so hotly over  the world that every book, every treasure,  would be doomed to destruction. This  vision was so vivid and so moving that  I determined to gather together all  the things of beauty and culture that  I could and preserve them here against  the doom toward which the world is rushing. (pause) Look at the world today! Is there anything  more pitiful? What madness there is,  what blindness, what unintelligent leadership!  A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity  crashing headlong against each other,  propelled by an orgy of greed and brutality.  The time must come, my friend, when  this orgy will spend itself, when brutality  and the lust for power must perish by  its own sword. Against that time is  why I avoided death and am here, and  why you were brought here. For when  that day comes, the world must begin  to look for a new life. And it is our  hope that they may find it here. For  here we shall be with their books ? 533 ? and their music and a way of life based  on one simple rule: Be Kind. (pause) When that day comes, it is our hope  that the brotherly love of Shangri-La  will spread throughout the world. (pause) Yes, my son, when the strong have devoured  each other, the Christian ethic may  at last be fulfilled, and the meek shall  inherit the earth. A long silence ensues during which Conway,  so engrossed is he in all he has just  heard, scarcely notices the Lama, who  has risen slowly and now stands before  him. The Lama reaches down and gently  touches him on the shoulder. CONWAY (scarcely audible) I understand you, Father. Conway kisses the High Lama's hand. HIGH LAMA You must come again, my son. Good night. Conway slowly rises to his feet and  turns to leave scene. INT. UPPER CHAMBER 220. MED. CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR TO LAMA'S  CHAMBERS Conway comes through. He walks as if  in a trance. CAMERA PULLS BACK as he  continues on his way - bearing an expression  of deep absorption. DISSOLVE TO: INT. LOWER CORRIDOR 221. MED. SHOT As Conway walks toward an open door  at the end of corridor leading to the  garden. Lovett emerges from one of the  rooms and sees him. He beckons to those  inside and almost immediately they come  out and start toward Conway. 222. MED. CLOSE SHOT NEAR GARDEN DOOR Conway, just about to exit, when the  others catch up to him. AD-LIB We thought you were never coming back! What'd you find out? When do we leave? Conway stares at them blankly. GEORGE What about the porters? CONWAY (vaguely) Porters? GEORGE Didn't you find out anything about the  porters? ? 534 ? CONWAY Why - I'm sorry - but I He starts away from them, but they crowd  around him. AD-LIB What were you doing all this time? You've been gone for hours. GEORGE For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter  with you? You went out there for the  purpose of CONWAY George. George - do you mind? I'm sorry,  but I can't talk about it tonight. He leaves them. EXT. GARDEN - NIGHT 223. MED. CLOSE SHOT Shooting toward garden through open  doorway. Conway walks away from the  crowd in f.g., all staring at him, nonplussed.  We see Conway walk through the garden  in b.g. and disappear. 224. CLOSEUP - GEORGE IN DOORWAY He stares at his brother, off, fearfully. EXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE VALLEY 225. FULL SHOT Of a pleasant and peaceful place. Conway  is walking along moodily, drinking in  the pastoral beauty. 226. MED. TRUCKING SHOT WITH CONWAY As he walks along. He comes to a spot  where a man and a woman are tilling  the soil, and stops to watch them. The  man looks up and, seeing Conway, makes  a friendly bow and doffs his hat. Conway  also bows. The woman curtsies prettily  and smiles. Conway doffs his hat in  acknowledgement. He is in a cheerful frame of mind and  continues his walk - CAMERA CONTINUING  WITH HIM. He greets several other people.  Upon seeing him, they also bow and doff  their hats. Conway does likewise. EXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE VALLEY - DAY 227. FULL SHOT Conway is walking along a street in  the valley. It is a quaint thoroughfare,  unlike anything we have ever seen before.  The small, one-story huts along its  very narrow sidewalk are of singularly  varied architecture - giving the impression  of being \"homemade.\" As a result of  this, no two are alike. Only one characteristic  about them is similar - their cleanliness.  Something about the atmosphere is fresh  and wholesome and peaceful. In front  of several of the huts native women  sit - some weaving on a tapestry board,  some nursing babies, some asleep, and  some just sitting. The keynote is contentment. 228. MED. TRUCKING SHOT With Conway, walking along. As he passes,  the women smile at him in the most friendly  fashion. From inside these homes, soft  and soothing music emanates. At the  end of the street, Conway finally arrives  at a garden spot. The suddenness of  this is startling, too - because of  its beauty. Sighing contentedly, Conway  throws himself at the foot of an overhanging  tree, and leans against the trunk. ? 535 ? 229. CLOSE SHOT - CONWAY He throws his head back, shuts his eyes  - in a restful and contemplative mood.  He remains this way quietly for a few  seconds, when he is attracted by the  singing of a chorus of children's voices.  He glances around. 230. LONG SHOT From Conway's angle. In the shadow of  a row of overhanging trees which form  an arch, a group of fifteen or twenty  children sing a hymn, or nursery song  - in English. Sondra (the violin girl  of previous scenes) stands in front  of them, a baton in hand, conducting  them. 231. CLOSE SHOT - CONWAY He smiles at the sight - and springing  to his feet starts in their direction. 232. MED. SHOT Of Sondra and the children, as Conway  saunters into the scene behind her.  He finds himself a comfortable place  under a tree and sits down. The children,  still singing, have seen his approach  and crane their necks curiously. 233. CLOSE SHOT - SONDRA She waves her baton and sings with the  children. Then she notices they are  being distracted and casually turns  her head. She is somewhat startled at  seeing Conway, but quickly recovers  her composure, and smiles wanly. 234. CLOSE SHOT - CONWAY He smiles also. CONWAY Do you mind? 235. WIDER ANGLE To include Sondra, Conway and some of  the children. They finish the song,  and Conway applauds. Sondra curtsies  prettily. She turns to the children. SONDRA This is Mr. Conway, children. 236. MED. SHOT In unison the twenty children curtsey. CHILDREN (all together - sing-song) Good morning, Mr. Conway. CONWAY How do you do? CHILDREN Very well, thank you. Conway scrambles to his feet and does  an exaggerated bow. Sondra laughs delightedly. SONDRA All right, children. We will now sing She lifts her baton and the thin, piping  voices fill the air. ? 536 ? 237. CLOSEUP - CONWAY He lights a cigarette and, leaning against  a tree, studies Sondra's face - impressed  by her beauty. 238. CLOSEUP - SONDRA She slyly glances backward, and a self-conscious  smile covers her face. 239. MED. SHOT As a child from the ranks breaks and  comes to Sondra, who leans down to listen  to the child - who whispers in her ear.  Sondra, murmuring, \"Of course, dear\"  and still waving her baton is, for the  moment, uncertain what to do. Then turning  to Conway, holds out the baton to him. SONDRA Do you mind? Conway snaps out of his reverie and  jumps forward. CONWAY Not at all. He takes the baton from her. SONDRA Thank you. And, taking the child by the hand, she  exits. 240. CLOSE SHOT - CONWAY Conducting the chorus in all seriousness  - albeit a trifle awkwardly. He turns  his head to watch Sondra, and when he  looks forward again, finds himself off-beat.  To cover his embarrassment, he smiles  foolishly. 241. MED. SHOT They come to the end of the song, but  Conway, whose eyes are searching for  Sondra, is oblivious of this and continues  to conduct mechanically. The children  break into laughter. 242. MED. CLOSE TRUCKING SHOT With Sondra as she returns with the  child clinging to her. As she turns  a bend, she looks up, surprised. 243. CLOSE SHOT - SONDRA As she laughs heartily. 244. CLOSE SHOT - CONWAY CONWAY All right, children. Now teacher is  going to be very busy this afternoon,  so school's dismissed! The children break into squeals and  race off. THE CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM as  they cross a footbridge, gleefully doff  their clothes and with yelps and cries  leap into a stream. 245. MED. SHOT - CONWAY AND SONDRA Favoring Conway. CONWAY Oh, please. I hope you're not going  to run away this time. ? 537 ? SONDRA (extending her hand) My name's Sondra. CONWAY I hope you'll forgive me for He hears curious, fluttering music coming  from somewhere. CONWAY (looking around) You know, each time I see you, I hear  that music. What is it? SONDRA Oh, you mean my pigeons. THE CAMERA SHOWS PIGEONS swirling overhead. Sondra pulls a miniature flute from  one of her pocket. SONDRA (showing him) It's these little flutes that I attached  to their tails. See? Come along with  me, and I'll show you how I put them  on. They exit scene. INT. PIGEON HOUSE 246. MED. CLOSE SHOT Of a large coop where pigeons are bred  and raised. The pigeons flutter around,  landing on Sondra and Conway, as she  shows him her collection with pride.  She grabs one pigeon and ties one of  the miniature flutes to its legs. SONDRA You see, this is how we tie them on.  And by varying the size of the flutes,  I can get any notes I wish. The wind  does the rest. Here's a little fellow  who lost his! She grabs another pigeon, ties a flute  to its legs. CONWAY (wonderingly) Was this your idea? SONDRA Yes. Hold this pigeon. CONWAY You suggested my being brought here,  didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd  fit in? SONDRA That was easy. I read your books. CONWAY Oh, you've read my books. You do more  things! What have my books got to do  with it? SONDRA I saw a man whose life was empty. ? 538 ? CONWAY A man whose life was empty! SONDRA Oh, I know. It was full of this and  full of that. But you were accomplishing  nothing. You were going nowhere, and  you knew it. Conway scrutinizes her face intently. SONDRA As a matter of fact, all I saw was a  little boy whistling in the dark. CONWAY A little boy whistling in the dark!?  Do you realize that there is a British  cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring  out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings,  waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London?  Do you know that at this minute there  are headlines shrieking all over the  world the news that Conway is missing?  Does that look like a man whose life  is empty? SONDRA (after a pause) Yes. CONWAY (good-naturedly) You're absolutely right. And I had to  come all the way to a pigeon house in  Shangri-La to find the only other person  in the world who knew it. May I congratulate  you? She laughs merrily and shakes his hand. SONDRA I really only brought you here to show  you my pigeons! CONWAY Don't worry about the pigeons. From  now on, you can put flutes on my tail  and bells on my feet! She turns to leave, and he follows,  exiting scene. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. SOMEWHERE ON TOP OF A HILL 247. MEDIUM TRUCKING SHOT Sondra and Conway, walking. This spot  is on top of a hill overlooking the  splendor of the valley below. 248. CLOSER TRUCKING SHOT They walk along silently for a few seconds,  while Conway studies her face speculatively. CONWAY There are so many questions I'd like  to ask you, I hardly know where to begin. ? 539 ? SONDRA I'll help you. To begin with, you'd  like to know what I'm doing here. Whether  I was born here. CONWAY Thank you. SONDRA Well, I was almost born here. It took  place in that wild country beyond the  pass. My father and mother were in a  party of explorers who got lost and  wandered around for a year. When Chang  found us, only Father and I were alive.  But he was too weak to climb the pass.  He died on the way. I was brought up  here by Father Perrault himself. CONWAY Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked  to him last night. SONDRA Yes, I know. CONWAY Father Perrault. Of course I can't quite  get used to this age thing. He steals a sideways glance at her.  She is greatly amused. SONDRA (satisfying his obvious curiosity) I'm thirty. CONWAY Oh, you're going to make life very simple. 249. MED. SHOT As they arrive at a scenic overlook.  It is getting toward dusk. CONWAY (wonderingly) It's inconceivable. SONDRA What is? CONWAY All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent  history. This place, hidden away from  the rest of the world, with its glorious  concepts, and now you come along and  confuse me entirely. SONDRA I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the  light. But why do I confuse you? Am  I so strange? CONWAY On the contrary, you're not strange.  And that in itself is confusing. I have  the same idea about Shangri-La. The  sense that I've been here before, that  I belong here. SONDRA I'm so glad. ? 540 ? CONWAY I can't quite explain it, but everything  is somehow familiar. The very air that  I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet  rooted in the good earth of this fertile  valley, while its head explores the  eternal. All the beautiful things I  see, these cherry blossoms, you - all  somehow familiar. (chuckles to himself) I've been kidnapped and brought here  against my will. A crime, a great crime,  yet I accept it amiably, with the same  warm amiability one tolerates only from  a very dear and close friend. Why? Can  you tell me why? SONDRA Perhaps because you've always been a  part of Shangri-La without knowing it. CONWAY I wonder. SONDRA I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's  a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's  heart. I have never seen the outside  world. But I understand there are millions  and millions of people who are supposed  to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know  that secretly they are all hoping to  find a garden spot where there is peace  and security, where there's beauty and  comfort, where they wouldn't have to  be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish  the whole world might come to this valley. CONWAY Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for  long. She laughs as they exit scene. EXT. SOMEWHERE IN SHANGRI-LA[14] 250. TRUCKING SHOT Barnard is bringing a reluctant Lovett  along on an excursion into the Valley.  They pass friendly natives and farmers  at work. LOVETT I don't know why I associate with you,  Mr. Barnard - or Mr. Chalmers Bryant  - or Mr. Embezzler - or whatever your  name may be. BARNARD Just call me Barney. LOVETT Barney? Why should I? Never! We have  nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What  effrontery! BARNARD Okay, Lovey. ? 541 ? LOVETT And this trip to the valley. I can't  imagine why I'd allow you to drag me  down here. Why, we don't know anything  about these people. We're not even armed! BARNARD They're very nice people - except that  they've got horns. LOVETT (alarmed at first) Horns? Barnard points to sheepherders with  their long horns. BARNARD (chuckles) Yeah. You know. LOVETT Horns? What kind of horns? Lovett sees his point, starts to chuckle,  but still looks wary. BARNARD Here, here! Come on. They won't hurt  you. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. A WATERFALL 251. MEDIUM SHOT Barnard has encountered some beautiful  native girls, and they have surrounded  him with their hospitality - plying  him with wine and food. Lovett is off  scene. BARNARD Okay, honey, all I want is a glass of  wine! Thanks very much. NATIVE GIRL Please sit down. BARNARD This is fine. This is swell. No, just  a drink. I've been walking and I'm a  little thirsty, you see? That's all  right. I don't just happen to be very  hungry. Say look, all I asked for was  a glass of water. Look here, I've got  to have some help with this. (looking around anxiously) Now, Lovey! Where is Lovey? 252. CLOSE SHOT Of Lovett, lagging behind and missing  out on all the fun. LOVETT Mr. Barnard? 253. MEDIUM SHOT Favoring Barnard as Lovett comes into  view. BARNARD Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked  for a glass of wine and look what I  got. Come on, sit down. ? 542 ? LOVETT So that's where you are. I might of  known it. No wonder you couldn't hear  me. BARNARD You were asked to have a glass of wine.  Sit down! LOVETT And be poisoned out here in the open? BARNARD Certainly not! NATIVE GIRL (to Lovett) For me, won't you please have a glass  of wine? LOVETT I never drink wine in the daytime. BARNARD (as he is poured a glass anyway) There you are! LOVETT (raising the glass to his lips) This doesn't obligate me in any way. NATIVE GIRL No. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. A CLEARING 254. FULL SHOT A merry Lovett has had too much to drink.  Now he is entertaining a group of native  children, who are huddled at his feet.  Other natives watch the entertainment.  Bernard, watching from one side, is  losing patience. LOVETT then the bears came right into the  bedroom and the little baby bear said,  \"Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my  bed.\" And then the mama bear said, \"Oh  dear, somebody's been sleeping in my  bed!\" And then the big papa bear, he  roared, \"And somebody's been sleeping  in my bed!\" Well, you have to admit  the poor little bears were in a quandary! BARNARD I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on,  Lovey! LOVETT (continuing) They were in a quandary, and BARNARD Come on, Lovey. ? 543 ? LOVETT Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's  the matter? Are you going to be a fuss  budget all your life? Here, drink it  up! Aren't you having any fun? Where  was I? BARNARD In a quandary. They all laugh. LOVETT I'm telling this story! I'm telling  it. (continuing) Yes, the poor little bears didn't know  what to do, you see, because somebody  had been sleeping in their bed. A CHILD IN THE AUDIENCE Who slept in their beds? NATIVE GIRL (the one who poured him a drink of wine  alluringly) Who was it, Lovey? LOVETT (smitten) Oh, you call me Lovey, eh? (to Barnard) Look at those eyes? There's the devil  in those eyes! DISSOLVE TO: INT. LOVETT'S BEDROOM 255. CLOSE SHOT Following Lovett as he enters, unusually  chipper, singing \"Here we go gathering  nuts in May . . . \" He is in such a  good mood that he improvises the lyrics,  putting Shangri-La in with his la-la-las.  After glancing out the window, Lovett  sits down and pulls out his journal.  He writes: INSERT: APRIL 4TH 24TH DAY AT SHANGRI-LA. FEEL SO GOOD  I COULD SOW A WILD OAT He pauses, looks up, opens the compact  box at his side and looks at himself  confidently and admiringly in the mirror.  Returning to his journal, he adds: INSERT: OR TWO. EXT. GARDEN - DAY 256. MED. SHOT (MOVING) With George as he disconsolately walks.  He is startled by the sound of Maria's  voice calling him. CAMERA PANS with  him as he crosses to a sheltered spot  where Maria sits on a garden bench. ? 544 ? GEORGE Hello, Maria. He fumbles for a cigarette. 257. MED. CLOSE SHOT MARIA (a little hurt) You promised to come for tea yesterday.  I waited for so long. GEORGE I'm sorry. (chagrined to discover he has no cigarettes  left) I haven't even got any cigarettes left! MARIA I'll make some for you! (pleading) You will come today? GEORGE (after a pause) Perhaps. MARIA (tenderly) Please say you will. The days are so  very long and lonely without you. (a whisper) Please . . . GEORGE All right, I'll be there. MARIA (happily) Thank you. GEORGE (suddenly) You'll tell me some of the things I  want to know, won't you? You'll tell  me who runs this place. And why we were  kidnapped. And what they're going to  do with us! 258. CLOSEUP - MARIA From the moment he starts to speak,  her face clouds. George's voice continues  without interruption. GEORGE'S VOICE Chang's been lying about those porters,  hasn't he? She runs off, frightened. INT. ELSEWHERE IN THE GARDEN 259. MED. CLOSE SHOT Following Conway and Sondra as they  stroll peacefully hand in hand amongst  the sculpted shrubbery and rows of flowers.  There is a sudden pealing of bells.  The two of them look off and pause,  their gaze momentarily captured by picturesque  snowcapped peaks in the distance. ? 545 ? CONWAY (moved) Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump. SONDRA Bump? CONWAY When the plane lands at Shangri-La and  wakes us all up. She gives him a pinch. CONWAY Ouch! SONDRA (chuckling) You see, it's not a dream. CONWAY You know, sometimes I think that it's  the other that's the dream. The outside  world. Have you never wanted to go there? SONDRA Goodness, no. From what you tell me  about it, it certainly doesn't sound  very attractive. CONWAY It's not so bad, really. Some phases  are a little sordid, of course. That's  only to be expected. SONDRA Why? CONWAY Oh, the usual reasons. A world full  of people struggling for existence. SONDRA Struggling, why? CONWAY Well, everybody naturally wants to make  a place for himself, accumulate a nest  egg, and so on. SONDRA Why? CONWAY You know, if you keep on asking that,  we're not going to get anywhere. And  don't ask me why. SONDRA I was just going to. CONWAY It's the most annoying word in the English  language. Did you ever hear a child  torture his parent with it? ? 546 ? (mimicking) Mother's little darling musn't stick  her fingers in the salad bowl. Why?  Because it isn't lady-like to do that.  Why? Because that's what forks are made  for, darling. SONDRA (joining in) Why, mother? CONWAY Because mother read it in a book somewhere,  and if mother's little darling doesn't  take her fingers out of the salad bowl  this instant, mother's going to wring  her little neck. Sondra laughs heartily. SONDRA (teasingly) Would you like to wring my little neck? CONWAY I'd love it! SONDRA Why? Conway makes a grab for her and she  spurts away. He chases her across part  of the garden, and past the fountain  catches up with her. He reaches to place  his hands around her neck. SONDRA (laughing) I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. He hesitates, studying her intently. 260. CLOSE-UP They kiss. SONDRA (when they break) I've thought about it for years. (softly) I knew you'd come. And I knew if you  did - you'd never leave. (a whisper) Am I forgiven for sending for you? CONWAY Forgiven. (a pause) You know, when we were on that plane,  I was fascinated by the way its shadow  followed it. That silly shadow racing  along over mountains and valleys, covering  ten times the distance of the plane.  It was always there to greet us with  outstretched arms when we landed. And  I've been thinking that somehow you're  that plane, and I'm that silly shadow.  That all my life I've been rushing up  and down hills, leaping rivers, crashing  over obstacles, never dreaming that  one day that beautiful thing in flight  would land on this earth and into my  arms. ? 547 ? They kiss again. DISSOLVE TO: INT. LIVING ROOM 261. MEDIUM SHOT Chang is being visited by Lovett, who  has lost his petrified manner. LOVETT Amazing, Mr. Chang. This place is amazing!  And that marble quarry in the valley  is simply magnificent. Oh, I've looked  around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers  and your cloth-weavers - they all seem  so very, very happy. CHANG Yes. LOVETT You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but  right here you have Utopia.[15] CHANG You've very kind Mr. Lovett. 262. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO LOVETT I don't mean it in that sense. I only  give credit where credit is due. (pauses - sincerely) Er, Mr. Chang, I'm very anxious to have  you realize that I never for a moment  believed that ridiculous kidnapping  story. CHANG Oh, I'm so glad. LOVETT Simply preposterous. Do you know what  I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang,  I held a sort of a self-inventory. I  said to myself last night, Mr. Chang,  I said, \"Lovey\" (catches himself - looks around) Mr. Lovett! \"Mr. Lovett,\" I said, \"you  are an ungrateful fool . . . \" CHANG Why, no. LOVETT \"Ungrateful fool . . . !\" Those were  my very words to myself last night.  \"Here are these people in Shangri-La  doing everything in their power to make  our stay comfortable and happy and I  haven't done one single thing to show  my appreciation.\" CHANG Now, what would you like to do? ? 548 ? LOVETT Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your  permission of course, and while I'm  waiting for these porters, I would like  to organize classes for those children  in the valley and teach them something  practical and something useful. Geology. CHANG Splendid! LOVETT Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a  professor for twenty years? - and a  very good one. CHANG I'm sure you were. When would you like  to start? LOVETT Oh, immediately. CHANG (offering his handshake) Then it's done. LOVETT Oh, thank you. Thank you! CHANG Thank you. EXTERIOR GARDEN 263. MEDIUM SHOT Conway sits on a bench - Barnard leans  over him, showing him a map - a-twitter  with an idea. BARNARD You see? You get the idea? From this  reservoir here I can pipe in the whole  works. Oh, I'm going to get a great  kick out of this. Of course it's just  to keep my hand in, but with the equipment  we have here, I can put a plumbing system  in for the whole village down there.  Can rig it up in no time. (aghast) Do you realize those poor people are  still going to the well for water? 264. CLOSER SHOT - THE TWO CONWAY (a twinkle in his eye) It's unbelievable. BARNARD Think of it! In times like these. CONWAY Say, what about that gold deal? BARNARD Huh? ? 549 ? CONWAY Gold. You were going to BARNARD (interrupting) Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going  to run off with it. (full of business) Say, I've got to get busy. I want to  show this whole layout to Chang. (exiting) So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels. CONWAY All right. He disappears. We hear him whistling,  something joyous. Probably \"The Old  Gray Mare Ain't What She Usta Be\" 265. CLOSEUP - CONWAY As he watches Barnard go, pleased at  the metamorphosis that's taking place  in him. Suddenly he sees George and  jumps up. CONWAY George. 266. MED. LONG SHOT From Conway's angle. George has just  made his appearance. CONWAY George! George keeps on going and Conway runs  toward him. 267. MED. CLOSE SHOT As Conway catches up to Georgeand takes  him by the arm. CONWAY (sincerely) George - you're behaving like a child.  You haven't opened your mouth in two  weeks. GEORGE (coldly) I don't see that there's anything to  say. And releasing his arm, he leaves Conway  abruptly. 268. CLOSEUP - CONWAY As a look of deep pain comes into his  face. He stands for several seconds  - looking helplessly - and despairingly  in George's direction. FADE OUT: FADE IN INT. LIVING ROOM 269. MEDIUM SHOT Chang and Conway playing chess. Conway  leans over the board, a faraway expression  on his face. Chang leans over - moves  a 'man' into position. ? 550 ? CHANG I'm afraid that does it. Conway looks up - aroused from his reverie.  He glances over the board. CONWAY Yes. I'm afraid it does. CHANG Shall we have another? CONWAY (rises) No thanks. Not tonight if you don't  mind. He crosses to a window and glances out.  Chang looks up and sees Maria in doorway. CHANG Come in, my dear. 270. CLOSE SHOT - MARIA In doorway. She seems slightly embarrassed. MARIA Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. (self-consciously) I thought Mr. Conway's brother was here.  Excuse me. She leaves. 271. CLOSE SHOT - CONWAY AND CHANG CHANG Charming, isn't she? CONWAY Yes, charming. CHANG Your brother seems quite fascinated  by her. CONWAY Why not? She's an attractive young woman. CHANG Young? She arrived here in 1888. She  was 20 at the time. She was on her way  to join her betrothed - when her carriers  lost their way in the mountains. The  whole party would have perished but  for meeting some of our people. CONWAY (hands in the air) Amazing! She still doesn't look over  20. When is she likely to grow old in  appearance? CHANG Not for years. Shangri-La will keep  her youthful indefinitely. CONWAY Suppose she should leave it? ? 551 ? CHANG Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely.  You couldn't drive her out. CONWAY No, I mean about her appearance. If  she should leave the valley - what would  happen? CHANG Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance  to her actual age. CONWAY (shaking his head) It's weird. (a pause) Chang, how old are you? CHANG Age is a limit we impose upon ourselves.  You know, each time you Westerners celebrate  your birthday, you build another fence  around your minds. They are interrupted by the entrance  of George. GEORGE (stridently) Oh, there you are! You're just the man  I'm looking for. 272. WIDER ANGLE As George comes up to them. He is livid  with rage. He crosses directly to in  front of Chang. GEORGE A fine trick! Smart, aren't you? What  a pack of lies you told us about those  porters! Of course the minute they arrive,  we can make arrangements to leave. If  they take us. But you knew very well  you'd tell them not to! 273. THREE SHOT - FAVORING GEORGE CHANG Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't GEORGE (snapping at him) You've been lying to us ever since we  got here! Apparently it's worked with  some people. Perhaps it's because they  lack the courage to do anything about  it. But not me, Chang. You're up against  the wrong man. I'll get out of here,  if I have to blow this fantastic place  into the valley! I'll get outporters  or no porters! And with this threat, he storms out  of the room. CHANG You must prevail upon him not to attempt  the journey. He could never get through  that country alive. ? 552 ? CONWAY (tensely) I can't let him go alone. It's suicide! He exits abruptly. Chang watches him  depart, deeply upset. INT. HIGH LAMA'S CHAMBER 274. MEDIUM SHOT Conway sits in the same place before  the Lama. LAMA Yes, of course, your brother is a problem.  It was to be expected. CONWAY I knew you'd understand. That's why  I came to you for help. LAMA You must not look to me for help. Your  brother is no longer my problem. He  is now your problem, Conway. CONWAY Mine? LAMA Because, my son, I am placing in your  hands the future and destiny of Shangri-La. (pause) For I am going to die. There is a pause during which Conway  cannot conceal his amazement at this  simple statement. LAMA I knew my work was done when I first  set eyes upon you. 275. CLOSEUP - CONWAY AND LAMA Conway is too awed and impressed to  utter a sound. The High Lama finally  resumes. LAMA I have waited for you, my son, for a  long time. I have sat in this room and  seen the faces of newcomers. I have  looked into their eyes and heard their  voices - always in hope that I might  find you . My friend, it is not an arduous  task that I bequeath, for our order  knows only silken bonds. To be gentle  and patient, to care for the riches  of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while  the storm rages without. CONWAY Do you think this will come in my time? ? 553 ? 276. MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO HIGH LAMA You, my son, will live through the storm.  You will preserve the fragrance of our  history, and add to it a touch of your  own mind. Beyond that, my vision weakens. (pause - magisterially) But I see in the great distance a new  world starting in the ruins - stirring  clumsily - but in hopefulness, seeking  its vast and legendary treasures. And  they will all be here, my son, hidden  behind the mountains in the Valley of  the Blue Moon, preserved as if by a  miracle. The voice of the Lama, toward the last,  seems to fade out. Conway, thoroughly  engrossed, half-consciously waits for  it to continue. Following a protracted  silence, he slowly turns toward the  Lama. A breeze blows through the room,  ruffling curtains on the window. 277. CLOSE SHOT - THE HIGH LAMA From whose face the glow has faded.  There is nothing left but a dark-shadowed  mask. 278. CLOSEUP - CONWAY He stares, uncertainly, for a long while,  with a slow realization that the High  Lama is dead. Quite unaware that he  is being moved emotionally, tears well  up in his eyes. While still sitting  this way, unable to stir, he becomes  conscious of activity around him. 279. MEDIUM SHOT As two servants, unbeckoned, arrive  - only to peer, solemn-faced, at the  Lama. Then, in intervals of seconds,  groups of Lamas, hitherto unseen, enter  softly and silently, and gather around  the High Lama. We hear indistinguishable  murmurs that might or might not be prayers.  Conway is only vaguely aware of their  presence - and after a few moments,  scarcely conscious of what is actuating  his movements, he drifts away from the  murmuring Lamas, and walks in the direction  of the door. DISSOLVE TO: INT. BARNARD'S ROOM 280. MEDIUM SHOT Barnard and Gloria are on their knees  on the floor. Before them they have  spread a large map or chart. Barnard  is enthusiastically out - lining his  plans. BARNARD Look, honey. We run the pipes through  here, and we connect with the main water  line here. GLORIA Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes? BARNARD Oh, that's a cinch. I'll show them how  to cast pipes out of clay. This is as far as they get for George  at this moment barges in. ? 554 ? GEORGE There you are! Barnard, you'd better  get your things together. We're leaving. BARNARD Leaving? GEORGE Yes. I've just been talking with the  porters. They're going to take us. We've  got clothing, food, everything. Come  on! BARNARD When are you going to start? GEORGE Right this very minute! The porters  are waiting for us on the plateau. And  that Chinaman thought he could stop  me. Come along. BARNARD I think I'll stick around. I'll leave  with the porters on their next trip. GEORGE You mean you don't want to go? BARNARD Well - I'm GEORGE I see. You're afraid of going to jail,  eh? BARNARD Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing  business GEORGE All right! If you insist on being an  idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing  you. (to Gloria) How about you? BARNARD Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey. (before she can answer) She'll stick around too. (to Gloria) Is that right? GLORIA (beaming) If you want me to! BARNARD Sure - sure. Don't you worry. I'll take  care of you. GEORGE All right, suit yourself. But just remember  you had your chance. ? 555 ? As he starts out, Lovett enters. GEORGE How about you? Do you want to go? LOVETT Go? Where? GEORGE Home. Away from here. I've got porters  to take us back. 281. CLOSE TWO SHOT - GEORGE AND LOVETT LOVETT Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible.  Why, I have my classes all started. GEORGE (irritably) I don't care what you've got started.  Do you want to go? LOVETT Well - no - I think I'd better wait.  Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait. GEORGE (grumbling as he goes) You'll wait till you rot! LOVETT (glowering after him) Yes. (does a double-take) Barney! BARNARD Lovey! Lovett immediately dismisses George  from his mind and his face brightening,  he starts toward Barnard and Gloria. 282. MED. CLOSE SHOT As Lovett joins the two on the floor. LOVETT Hello, Gloria. GLORIA Hello. LOVETT Barney, I've just finished translating  one of the most interesting old tablets  you can imagine. It told me all about  the origin of the Masonic symbols and BARNARD That's swell, Lovey. I want to show  you something. Look! He proudly displays his map. ? 556 ? LOVETT Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it? BARNARD Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going  to run pipes all through the village As all three heads go into a huddle. INT. CONWAY'S ROOM 283. CLOSE SHOT Conway stands in front of a window -  his arms extended across - peering out  moodily. He is watching a solemn and  slow-moving procession of torchlight-bearers  - the funeral rites of the High Lama  - accompanied by cermonial music and  drum-beating. 284. LONG SHOT Shooting over his shoulder. Getting his view of the magisterial  procession. 285. CLOSE SHOT Conway, as he thoughtfully surveys the  surroundings of which he has just become  master. 286. CLOSE SHOT - AT DOOR George appears in the doorway. He looks  around and espies Conway. For a moment  he stands uncertainly, and finally enters. GEORGE (softly) Bob 287. MEDIUM SHOT As Conway turns - and seeing him, evinces  no emotion whatsoever. CONWAY (a murmur) Hello, George. George looks at him peculiarly. Conway's  behavior is odd in view of their strained  relationship. GEORGE Well, you can stop worrying about everything  now, Bob. I've made arrangements to  leave. If you'll let me close that window,  I can talk to you. That noise is driving  me crazy. He closes the window. GEORGE I said we're getting out of here. Back  to civilization. I made a deal with  the porters. They brought in a load  of books or something, and they're leaving  tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for  us five miles outside the valley. Come  on, get your things together. Where's  your top coat? 288. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO CONWAY You can't leave, George. ? 557 ? GEORGE Why not? What's going to stop me? CONWAY (pleading) You mustn't. You've got to stay here  now. GEORGE (sharply) Stay here?! (more softly) What's the matter with you, Bob? You've  been acting strangely ever since we  came here. (no response from Conway) I've never seen you like this. Why can't  we leave? What's stopping us? Conway combats an impulse to tell him  the whole story. CONWAY (impulsively) Something grand and beautiful, George.  Something I've been searching for all  my life. The answer to the confusion  and bewilderment of a lifetime. I've  found it, George, and I can't leave  it. You mustn't either. GEORGE I don't know what you're talking about.  You're carrying around a secret that  seems to be eating you up. If you'll  only tell me about it. CONWAY I will, George. I want to tell you.  I'll burst with it if I don't. It's  weird and fantastical and sometimes  unbelievable, but so beautiful! (pause) Well, as you know, we were kidnapped  and brought here . . . While he is speaking, we slowly DISSOLVE TO: 289. SAME SCENE: As Conway is concluding his story. CONWAY . . . And that's the whole story, George.  He died as peacefully as the passing  of a cloud's shadow. His last words  to me were, \"I place in your hands,  my son, the future and destiny of Shangri-La.\"  Now you know why I can't leave. George listens to him intently, his  face a mask of apprehension. He stares  at his brother for some time and finally  rises and walks around for a few moments. GEORGE (running his hand through his hair) Well, I - I really don't know what to  say. Except that you must be completely  mad. ? 558 ? CONWAY So you think I'm mad? GEORGE What else can I think after a tale like  that? Good heavens, Bob, things like  that don't happen today. We're living  in the twentieth century. CONWAY So you think it's all nonsense, huh? 290. MED. SHOT - THE TWO GEORGE I think you've been hypnotized by a  lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why,  I wouldn't believe it if I heard it  in an English monastery. Why should  I swallow it here in Tibet? How do you  know the things they told you are true?  Did they show you any proof? CONWAY I don't need any proof. GEORGE (contemptuously) I knew there was a reason I hated this  place. I'd give half my life to fly  over it with a load of bombs just for  what they've done to you. How do you  know the things they told you are true?  Did they show you any proof? All this  talk about the Lamas being hundreds  of years old. How do you know? Did you  see their birth certificates? (some more pacing) I can't believe it, Bob. A bunch of  decrepit old men sit around and dream  about reforming the world. And you,  Bob Conway - two-feet-on-the-ground  Conway - want to join them. It's horrible. CONWAY Is that all my story meant to you? GEORGE What else could it mean to me? It's  obviously a lot of bunk. CONWAY Then you'd better go, George. This is  no place for you. GEORGE It's no place for you, Bob. Think of  what's waiting for you. Do you want  to stay here until you're half dead?  Until your mind starts corroding like  the rest of them? CONWAY Please, George. I don't want to talk  about it anymore. ? 559 ? GEORGE You've got to talk about it. What about  me? You said they stole that plane to  bring you here. I didn't want to come.  You owe me some responsibility. CONWAY I'm tired of owing you things. You're  free to go. Go ahead. GEORGE (suddenly) It's that girl - that girl has twisted  and turned CONWAY Enough! Never mind the girl! (a tense moment of silence) Well, why don't you go? Conway has sunk into a chair. George  kneels before him, pleading. GEORGE Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember,  you've looked after me. Now I think  you're the one that needs looking after.  I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something  wrong with you, let me help you. CONWAY (a murmur) Oh, George . . . GEORGE Besides, I - I don't feel like making  that trip alone, Bob. CONWAY George, you couldn't possibly stay here,  could you? GEORGE I'd go mad! CONWAY (after a moment's hesitation) George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac.  But I believe in this, and I'm not going  to lose it. (warmly) You know how much I want to help you,  but this is bigger, stronger if you  like than brotherly love. I'm sorry,  George. I'm staying. GEORGE (after a long pause) Well, I can't think of anything more  to say. Goodbye, Bob. They shake hands warmly. George turns  to leave. ? 560 ? CONWAY (just as George reaches the door) George, are you sure of the porters?  About their taking care of you, I mean? GEORGE (turning back) Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the  arrangements. CONWAY (glances up - surprised) Maria? GEORGE Yes, the little Russian girl. CONWAY What's she got to do with it? GEORGE She's going with me. Conway looks his extreme amazement. CONWAY (suddenly - wild) George, you're crazy! As he says this he jumps to his feet.  George is startled by his tone and manner. CONWAY (wheeling) You can't take her away from here! GEORGE (confidently) Why not? CONWAY (strongly) Because you can't. Do you know what  will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La?  She's a fragile thing that can only  live where fragile things are loved.  Take her out of this valley and she'll  fade away like an echo. GEORGE (slowly) What do you mean - \"fade away like an  echo\"? CONWAY She came here in 1888! 291. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO Favoring George. He laughs hollowly.  He runs his hand through his hair. He  stares unbelievingly at Conway. GEORGE This would be funny - if it wasn't so  pathetic. Why, she isn't a day over  twenty! ? 561 ? CONWAY You're wrong, George. GEORGE I'm not wrong. She told me so. Besides,  she wouldn't have to tell me. I'd know  anyway. (significantly) I found out a lot of things last night. (quickly) I'm not ashamed of it either. It's probably  one of the few decent things that's  ever happened in this hellish place. 292. MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO Conway stares at him. GEORGE (cynically) So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La?  Nobody would ever think of leaving? (vehemently) It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded  with me ever since I came here to take  her away from this awful place. She's  cried in my arms for hours, for fear  I'd leave her behind. And what's more,  she's made two trips to the plateau  to bribe the porters - for me! CONWAY (doesn't want to believe it) I don't believe it! I don't believe  a word of it! GEORGE All right. I'll prove it to you! You  believe everything they've told you  - without proof! I'll prove my story! As he speaks he has crossed to door  leading to adjoining room. Conway's  eyes are glued on him. GEORGE Come in a minute. After a few seconds Maria appears in  the doorway and stands there timidly. GEORGE Come in. She steps forward. 293. MED. SHOT - THE THREE GEORGE (shrewdly) I've got some bad news for you, Maria.  My brother and I have decided we can't  take you along. Maria's face collapses. ? 562 ? MARIA (small, frightened voice) You can't take me? She rushes to George and throws her  arms around him. MARIA But you promised me! You promised to  take me with you! Over her shoulder George looks victoriously  at Conway, who cannot believe his ears.  Suddenly Maria wheels on Conway. MARIA It's all your fault! It was all arranged  until he spoke to you! Why can't you  leave us alone? CONWAY Do you mean to tell me you want to leave  Shangri-La? MARIA I'll die if I have to stay here another  minute! I've waited a long time for  this chance to go, and you're not going  to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go  alone. It was I who bribed the porters.  If it weren't for me, you'd never get  out! CONWAY I thought the porters had instructions  from the High Lama not to take anyone. MARIA The High Lama? Who pays any attention  to him? The porters laugh at the High  Lama. All they want to know is how much  gold he will give them. Well, I gave  them more gold. I've been stealing it  for a year. I'd do anything to get out  of this place. To get away from that  High Lama - the one who calls himself  Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane  for years! CONWAY Father Perrault is dead. MARIA He's dead? That's fine. You won't see  me shedding any tears over him! (pleading) Oh George, you must take me with you! CONWAY (quietly) Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't  want to look like an old woman, do you? MARIA Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't  he? CONWAY Yes. ? 563 ? MARIA I thought so! He tells everyone I'm  old. He wants them to stay away from  me. He can't stand it when anyone comes  near. He's punished me for every minute  I've spent with George. If it weren't  for him, I would have been out of here  long ago, but he always stops me. Six  months ago, I tried to escape and he  locked me in a dark room. I nearly went  crazy. (pause) Look at me, Mr. Conway, do I look like  an old woman? Is this the skin of an  old woman? Look into my eyes and see  if these are the eyes of an old woman? GEORGE She was kidnapped and brought here two  years ago just as we were, Bob. CONWAY (thrown) I don't believe it! I can't believe  it. She's lying. (wildly) You're lying. You're lying! Every word  you've been saying is a lie! Come on,  say it! He has backed her into a corner and  is nearly throttling her. CONWAY You're lying, aren't you? MARIA No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What  reason could I have for lying? The chances  are that we'll never come out of that  horrible trip alive, but I'd rather  die out there in a snowstorm and be  buried alive, than to stay here one  more minute now. Thoroughly disillusioned, Conway emits  a few cynical chuckles - shakes his  head - stares blankly for a moment. CONWAY (dead voice) You say the porters are waiting for  us? GEORGE Yes. CONWAY The clothes? GEORGE (alertly) Yes, everything! CONWAY What about the others? ? 564 ? GEORGE I've already asked them. They're afraid  to make the trip. We'll have to send  an expedition back after them. CONWAY (business-like) Come on! We're wasting time! Conway dashes around and collects his  things. MARIA Are you taking me? CONWAY Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on! They start out the door and we . . . DISSOLVE TO: EXT. IN THE GARDEN 294. MED. CLOSE TRUCKING SHOT Conway, George and Maria on their way  out of the main building. The funeral  procession continues around them. The  two men walk together, Maria behind.  George is cheerful and buoyant. GEORGE It won't be long now before we're in  London. Can't you just see everyone  when we pop out of the blue! Conway's jaw is set grimly. 295. MED. SHOT As Conway, George and Maria continue. GEORGE We'll have them breathless when they  hear our story. While he speaks, Conway turns his head  around, looking for a glimpse of Sondra. 296. MEDIUM SHOT - CHANG As he hurries out of the building and  looks out at them from a roof terrace. 297. CLOSE SHOT - MOVING WITH CONWAY As he continues to look back in Sondra's  direction, although he keeps in step  with George. GEORGE'S VOICE You had me worried for a while. I thought  you were gone completely. Conway turns his head away. 298. THREE SHOT (MOVING) Conway, George and Maria. George glances  up at Conway. ? 565 ? GEORGE (sincerely - grinning) Lucky thing for me you snapped out of  it, too. You saved my life. I never  could have made it alone. CONWAY What was that? GEORGE I was saying CONWAY Can't you shut up? Must you go on babbling  like an idiot? George looks up, startled. 299. LONG SHOT Sondra has come running out to stand  anxiously beside Chang. 300. MED. CLOSE SHOT Sondra and Chang. SONDRA What's happened? Where's Bob? CHANG He's going, my child. SONDRA Going? CHANG But he will return. SONDRA Oh no! No! Bob! Shouting, she rushes off and the CAMERA  FOLLOWS HER as she races down a long  flight of stairs, calling out Conway's  name. 301. TRUCKING CLOSEUP - SONDRA As she runs, calling out Conway's name  and weeping. 302. A SERIES OF SHOTS Showing Conway, George and Maria - accompanied  by a dozen or more porters - as they  approach the mountain opening where  they first entered Shangri-La. 303. CLOSEUP - CONWAY He hesitates at the opening, looks back  one more time. His eyes show confusion  and defeat. George, ahead, calls out  to him to hurry. 304. TRUCKING MEDIUM SHOT - SONDRA As she stumbles up the trail to the  opening, minutes behind. The wind howls  on the other side. She cries and weeps,  calling out Conway's name, but he can  no longer be seen. ? 566 ? DISSOLVE TO: 305.

DAY The whole caravan are seen in the distance,  clambering up a mountain-side - hoisted  by ropes. DISSOLVE TO: 308. NIGHT In the middle of a vast plain. They  attempt to put up tents, which proves  futile, as a raging snowstorm rips the  canvas from its moorings. DISSOLVE TO: 309. DAY The large group are seen lowering themselves  in single file down a ledge alongside  a ravine. The wind howls. DISSOLVE TO: 310. DAY A mountain pass somewhere with a hailstorm  swiping viciously across their faces.  They edge their way pre-cautiously across  a narrow ledge. Suddenly the girl loses  her bearings - slips - screams - and  is caught by Conway just in time to  save her from falling down the side  of the jagged mountain. DISSOLVE TO: 311. MED. SHOT - NIGHT Maria has one arm around George and  the other around Conway - limping. She  has her head down. They trudge silently.  The porters are off in the distance,  leaving them behind. MARIA (collapsing) I can't stand it. I can't go on anymore!  I've got to rest. She stumbles and they help her up. George  looks off toward the porters helplessly. MARIA (hysterical) How long is this going to go on? I can't  stand it, I say. 312. MED. SHOT Of the porters, laughing at their distress. ? 567 ? 313. MED. SHOT - THE THREE GEORGE Bob, can't you get them to wait for  us? They're leaving us farther behind  every day. CONWAY There's nothing that would suit them  better than to lose us, but we must  go on. (to Maria - gently) Come on. MARIA No, I can't! I can't! You've got to  let me rest! You've got to let me rest! CONWAY (calling out to the porters) Hey! 314. MED. SHOT Of the porters, still laughing. The  lead porter whips out a gun and fires  at them for sport. 315. MED. SHOT - THE THREE They are in no danger. The porters are  too far off. GEORGE (contemptuously) Target practice again! One of these  days they're going to hit us. CONWAY (wryly) As long as they keep on aiming at us,  we're safe. (to Maria) Come now, child. They start to move again. 316. MED. SHOT Of the porters. They are still laughing,  and now others have drawn out their  guns. Firing off wildly, they trigger  an ominous thunder overhead. 317. MED. SHOT - THE THREE Looking up, they see an avalanche beginning. 318. A SERIES OF SHOTS Of the avalanche, picking up strength  and fury as it crashes downhill, sweeping  over the porters and crushing them to  death. 319.

MEDIUM SHOT - DAY A scene in which Conway carries the  girl on his back. George walks behind.  The wind continues to howl. ? 568 ? 321. CLOSEUP - GEORGE Staring at the girl's face as it hangs  over Conway's back. Suddenly, his eyes  widen. 322. CLOSEUP - MARIA A distorted view of her. Youth and beauty  seem to be vanishing. 323.

MEDIUM SHOT - NIGHT On the backs of the two men, who bend  over Maria. CAMERA DRAWS BACK as they  straighten up. Both stare down aghast  at the girl, whom we do not see. 325. ANOTHER ANGLE To include the girl. 326. MED. SHOT OF THE THREE The only illumination comes from the  moon. We cannot get a clear view of  her face. But what we see seems to us  to be small, withered and aged. She  is dead. The men stare at her intently. 327. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO MEN Who watch her, immobile. George looks  despairing. Slowly his head turns toward  the cliff behind him - and his eyes  become alert with an idea. His face  lights up with great determination.  He lets out a piteous howl, and breaks  away, racing out of scene. Conway turns sharply and is horrified. CONWAY George! George! 328. A SERIES OF SHOTS George stumbling toward the cliff, Conway  chasing him. George, falling head over  heels, rocking on the edge - then plummeting  over, falling down, down into the darkness. 329.

Slowly, he begins to rise and  start again. ? 569 ? DISSOLVE TO: 332. DAWN As the sun comes up, Conway emerges  from the whiteness, feeling his way  forward with a walking stick. He walks  with the pain and effort of a blind  man, and just as he manages to cross  a bridge spanning a great chasm, the  bridge collapses. He stumbles on. DISSOLVE TO: 333.

Finally he comes to one which causes  his eyes to pop. Muttering something  under his breath which sounds like \"Good  heavens!\" - and without taking his eyes  off the cablegram, he rises and starts  away. 338. MED. TRUCKING SHOT - CLERK As he strides across to the end of the  outer office - to a glass-panelled door  upon which we read \"ASSISTANT TO THE  FOREIGN SECRETARY\" - through which he  disappears. INT. OFFICE OF ASSISTANT 339. FULL SHOT As the clerk enters, full of excitement. CLERK Cable from Gainsford. ASSISTANT SECRETARY Oh, read it! ? 570 ? CLERK (reading) \"Leaving today for London with Conway  aboard S.S. Manchuria. Conway can tell  nothing of his experiences. Is suffering  from complete loss of memory. Signed,  Gainsford.\" ONE OF THE OTHERS IN THE ROOM Loss of memory? ASSISTANT SECRETARY All right, give it to the press. CLERK All of it? ASSISTANT SECRETARY Yes. Might as well - all of it. CLERK Yes, sir. ASSISTANT SECRETARY I'll dispatch a convoy to meet him. 340. A SERIES OF SHOTS More newspaper headlines reporting that  Conway has amnesia and other details  of his homeward journey. FADE OUT: FADE IN INT. OFFICE OF ASSISTANT 341. FULL SHOT Another clerk enters with haste, bearing  another cablegram. CLERK Conway's gone again! Run out! Listen  to this! From Gainsford. ASSISTANT SECRETARY Let me have it. (takes it and reads aloud) \"Aboard the S.S. Manchuria. Last night  Conway seemed to recover his memory.  Kept talking about Shangri-La, telling  a fantastic story about a place in Tibet.  Insisted upon returning there at once.  Locked him in room but he escaped us  and jumped ship during night at Singapore.  Am leaving ship myself to overtake him,  as fearful of his condition. Wrote down  details of Conway's story about Shangri-La  which I am forwarding. Lord Gainsford.\" 342. A SERIES OF SHOTS More newspaper headlines indicating  Gainsford has abandoned his pursuit  of Conway and returned to London. ? 571 ? FADE OUT: FADE IN INT. A GRILL ROOM OF A FASHIONABLE CLUB 343. FULL SHOT A scattering of men are present - some  at the bar - others at tables. 344. MED. SHOT IN A BOOTH Several men are seated. CARSTAIRS (looking off) Here's Gainsford now. They all look off. 345. LONG SHOT From their view. We see Gainsford standing  in the doorway, looking around. He spies  them and starts forward. 346. MEDIUM SHOT As Gainsford arrives at the booth. The  men rise with extended hands. AD-LIB Well, it's good to see you back, Lord  Gainsford! Thought you were never coming. MEEKER Will you have a drink? Sit down. 347. MED. CLOSE SHOT AT TABLE As Gainsford shakes hands with them,  and sits down. GAINSFORD Yes. Scotch and soda. I'm parched. ROBERTSON Here you are, ready and waiting. He pushes on in front of him. CARSTAIRS We're most eager to know what you've  discovered. AD-LIB Any news of Conway? Where is he? Did you bring him back? All this is said as Gainsford drains  his glass. GAINSFORD (setting glass down) Gentlemen, you see before you a very  weary old man, who has just ended a  chase that lasted nearly ten months. MEEKER Do you mean to tell me you never caught  up with him? ? 572 ? GAINSFORD Since that night that he jumped off  the ship until two weeks ago, I've been  missing him by inches. WYNANT You don't mean it! AD-LIB Think of it! ROBERTSON He was as determined as that to get  back? GAINSFORD Determined! Gentlemen, in the whole  course of my life, I have never encountered  anything so grim. During these last  ten months, that man has done the most  astounding things. He learned how to  fly, stole an army plane and got caught,  put into jail, escaped . . . all in  an amazingly short space of time. But  this was only the beginning of his adventures. (leaning forward) He begged, cajoled, fought, always pushing  forward to the Tibetan frontier. Everywhere  I went, I heard the most amazing stories  of the man's adventures. Positively  astounding. Until eventually, I trailed  him to the most extreme outpost in Tibet. 348. CLOSE GROUP SHOT Favoring the other men, as Gainsford  continues. GAINSFORD Of course he had already gone. But his  memory - ah - his memory will live with  those natives for the rest of their  lives. The Man Who Was Not Human, they  called him. They'll never forget the  devil-eyed stranger who six times tried  to go over a mountain pass where no  other human being dared to travel, and  six times was forced back by the severest  storms. They'll never forget the madman  who stole their food and clothing -  whom they locked up in their barracks  - but who fought six of their guards  to escape. 349. MED. CLOSE GROUP SHOT Gainsford still continues. GAINSFORD Why, their soldiers are still talking  about their pursuit to overtake him,  and shuddering at the memory. He led  them the wildest chase through their  own country, and finally he disappeared  over that very mountain pass that they  themselves dared not travel. (takes a drink) And that, gentlemen, was the last that  any known human being saw of Robert  Conway. ? 573 ? WYNANT Think of it! CARSTAIRS By jove, that's what I call fortitude! ROBERTSON Tell me something, Gainsford. What do  you think of his talk about Shangri-La?  Do you believe it? GAINSFORD (thinks a moment) Yes - yes, I believe it. (sincerely) I believe it, because I want to believe  it. They all watch his face, impressed by  his tone. 350. CLOSE SHOT - GAINSFORD As he lifts his glass. GAINSFORD Gentlemen, I give you a toast. Here  is my hope that Robert Conway will find  his Shangri-La! 351. CLOSE GROUP SHOT They all raise their glasses. GAINSFORD (softly) Here is my hope that we all find our  Shangri-La. They are all impressed by the sincerity  in his voice - and as their glasses  come together - CAMERA MOVES UP TO A  CLOSEUP OF THEM - and as the music starts  - the picture DISSOLVES TO: EXT. SOMEWHERE IN TIBET - NIGHT 352. CLOSEUP MOVING IN FRONT OF CONWAY - as he walks  forward with a steady step - his head  held high - his eyes sparkling - snow  pelting his face. 353. LONG SHOT Over his silhouetted back. As he walks away from the CAMERA, and  we STAY WITH HIM a long time as he approaches  a hill. DISSOLVE TO: 354. ANOTHER LONG SHOT He has now ascended to the middle of  the steep hill - his gait unchanged.  THE CAMERA PANS UP to the summit of  the incline - and we see that beyond  it the horizon is filled with a strange  warm light. Conway's figure - in silhouette  - disappears over the hill - bells ring  - and as the music begins to swell[16] FADE OUT. THE END"
