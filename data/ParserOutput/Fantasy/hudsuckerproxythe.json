THROUGH the window we see the BOARD MEMBERS still sitting around the table, paralyzed in attitudes of horror and  disbelief. All stare at the shattered window in the f.g. At the far end of the table, Hudsucker's chair is empty a oddly askew. His cigar still smokes in its ashtray. There are dust footprints down the middle of the long oak table. One Executive sits with a pluming cigarette held halfway his mouth; another holds a carafe suspended on its way to his water glass; another holds his spectacles inches from his nose. We hear only the HUM of the HUDSUCKER CLOCK. SID MUSSBURGER ENTERS FRAME at the window. He is a tall m aged executive with lean and rugged good looks and a  commanding presence. He knocks a last piece of glass out of the sill with his  knuckle, looks out, grunts, and draws his head back in. The CAMERA FOLLOWS him INTO the room. The other board mem heads swivel to watch him, all staring, searching despera for some hint as to the fate of their fallen leader.  Apparently, some absurd hope still lingers. Mussburger perches on the board table by his own chair. He reaches over to pluck the smoking cigar from the suici ashtray."
