There's blood in the streets & it's up to my knees  She came  Blood in the streets of Chicago  She came  Blood on the rise and it's following me  Just about the break of day (etc)  The river runs red down the legs of the city  She came  The women are crying red rivers of weeping The MONTAGE collides into an ECU on JIM -- drinking as if silence the images, the sounds we hear and see on his fac Spirits crying for release. In alcoholic solace. He passe out, head hitting the bar. Jim's English friend, MIKE, walks in, throwing a harsh sh of LA morning light across the dark bar and JIM's face, b eyed, passed out on the counter. He has a drinking paunch With him are TOM BAKER, \"TOM\", the actor from the Warhol  scene in New York and a huge biker type drinker named DOG one of Jim's roadmen, a beard fanning his chest, tattoos  everywhere. In the front of these three monoliths are abo twenty beer bottles, numerous Jack Daniels bottles emptie and a lesbian BARTENDRESS pouring up a breakfast shot of  bloody Marys... Mike hands Dog a breakfast in a brown pap bag."
