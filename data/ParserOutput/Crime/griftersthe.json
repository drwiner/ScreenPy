His hands fa to his sides, eyes stare upward, mouth still moves slight Lilly, shoving money away with her hands now, stares at h willing it not to happen. He stops moving. His eyes dull.

She blunders around the room, kicks the attache case, bends t pick it up. She studies the clasp, sees it still works, g back to her knees. LOW ANGLE, Lilly in f.g., Roy in b.g., as Lilly repacks t money into the case, wiping the blood from some wads onto carpet. Finishing, she closes the case, then remains on h knees, bending over the case. She WEEPS grindingly. WIDE SHOT, entrance door in b.g. Lilly's weeping subsides She gets wearily to her feet, and leaves the room. CAMERA HOLDS. SOUND of water running in sink. SOUND STOPS. Lilly reappears. She does not again look toward Roy. She picks the attache case, crosses to the door, opens it, steps ac the threshold, reaches back to switch off the light. GO T BLACK."
