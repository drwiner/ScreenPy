He goes into a slide, hitting the grass .underneath the bench, sliding under it, popping up on the other side. He rips a metal panel off the back of it as he does, revealing an AUTOMATIC PISTOL... .and just as quickly, he's up on one knee, aiming, using the bench as a shield as the Consultant rushes up, surprised and BAM! BAM! BAM: The Consultant drops where he is, three bullets hitting him in his two shoulders and his chest. People start SCREAMING and RUNNING the hell away from the gunplay. Wesley is about to run away himself, but when he turns, Fox is right there beside him... smiling. A couple of SECURITY GUARDS are with her, smiling as well.
