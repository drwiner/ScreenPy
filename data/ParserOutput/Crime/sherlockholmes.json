The heat is excruciating -- but the cloth protects them. Watson watches anxiously as the scorched cloth drops away, revealing that Holmes and Irene made it -- just. Relieved, Watson heads for the lever until \"Oh Shit!\" he looks ahead -- -- sees the scorched pig carcass being dragged into a long, conveyor-belt-wide SCALDING TANK OF BOILING WATER. Decision time for Watson -- help Holmes and Irene, or try the lever? He goes for the lever, reaches it, pushes it all the way over -- -- and the belt speeds up with a jerk. Watson hauls back on the lever, gets the belt back to the original speed, looks around for another possible off switch. Just as they reach the scalding tank, Holmes jumps off the belt (still opposite side to Watson), grabs Irene's legs and pulls her horizontal just before she's dragged into the boiling water."

Gathering himself, Holmes stands in the middle of the bare room and starts to lay out the clues he has on the floor. The Ox bone directly in front of him (at 12 o'clock). The eagle feather to his right (at 3 o'clock). The human hair behind him (at 6 o'clock) and the Lion's fang to his left (at 9 o'clock). Then with a piece of charcoal Holmes draws a circle around each image and a circle directly in the center of the four other circles. He then draws lines which join the circles together in the shape of a cross. In the center circle he draws a pentagram (using wax from a burning candle?). Then he pours a ring of salt around that circle. He lights four candles (one at each point of the cross) then stands in the center of the circle. He pulls a pocket knife from his coat, opens the blade, cuts his thumb and allows the drops of blood to drip onto the ground just outside the circle."

Blackwood snarls, mounts a frenzied attack, which Holmes simply tries to survive. The two men finally part, with Holmes cast off towards the end of the bridge. Blackwood smiles. He grabs Holmes' gun (which Blackwood knocked from Irene's hand earlier). Blackwood fires at Holmes. Holmes quickly ducks. The bullet misses him, but hits a bucket twirling above his head. A black liquid (tar) begins to pour out in a circle around him. Holmes turns, as if to flee (not that there's anywhere to go) -- his eyes lock on to something.
