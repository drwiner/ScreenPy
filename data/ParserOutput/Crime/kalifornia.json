He wrenches Brian's head back and whips his belt buckle k toward his throat! Brian manages to lift his hands to his neck an instant be the knife tears through his flesh. The knife slices a vic wound across the back of Brian's right hand. He drops the gun to the floor. Brian elbows Early in the ribs and pull away from him. He reaches to the ground for the gun, but  Early kicks him in the stomach and sends him crumbling to his knees."
