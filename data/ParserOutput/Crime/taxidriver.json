He walks at a fast, maniacal clip, looking only the sidewalk in front of him.  Out of his mouth comes a continuous stream of invective: \"That-cock-sucking-crazy- good-asshole-bitch-when-I-get-my-fucking-fingers-on-her- nigger-tits-I'm-gonna-ring-em-and-shit-up-her-ass...\" and on.

Finally, TRAVIS spies the object of his search: IRIS walk down the sidewalk with her GIRLFRIEND.  Iris wears her la blue sunglasses. TRAVIS checks to see if his .38 is in place (it is), open the door and exits from the cab. Flipping up the collar of his Army jacket, TRAVIS slouche over and walks toward IRIS.  He sort of sidles up next to her and walks beside her: TRAVIS always looks most suspic when he's trying to appear innocent."

We thought we had lost her, but now our lives are full again.  Needless to say, you are something of a hero around this household. I'm sure you want to know about Iris.  She is back in school and working hard.  The transition has been very hard for her, as you can well imagine, but we have taken steps to see she never has cause to run away again. In conclusion, Mrs. Steensma and I would like to again thank you from the bottom of our hearts. Unfortunately, we cannot afford to come to New York again to thank you in person, or we surely would.  But if you should ever come to Pittsburgh, you would find yourself a most welcome guest in our home. Our deepest thanks, Burt and Ivy Steensma"
