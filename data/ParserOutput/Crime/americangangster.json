Richie has evidence tables covered with cash, weapons, stocks, bonds, property deeds, pictures of Frank's holdin heroin in blue cellophane. Frank has celebrities, community leaders, Joe Louis himse who will testify to Frank's benevolent character. The Cha hugs the heroin trafficker warmly in front of everyone an Richie wonders if he should just give up now.

Frank's eyes smile as they regard Richie, and seem to ask Can you see this - can you see what you're up against - c you see how insignificant you are?
