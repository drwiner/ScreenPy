Take it at  face value.  Lou, Susie, I'm going  with my gut here.  He's got an alias  of Hidell to buy the rifle, \"O.H.  Lee\" to rent the room, right?  What's  in a name, right?  In intelligence,  they're assumed to be fake.  A name  is sort of like a postbox number, a  code - several different people can  use the same name, right?

World War II - Rumania,  Greece, Yugoslavia, I helped take  the Nazi intelligence apparatus out  to help us fight the Communists.   Italy '48 stealing elections, France  '49 breaking strikes - we overthrew  Quirino in the Philippines, Arbenz  in Guatemala, Mossadegh in Iran.   Vietnam in '54, Indonesia '58, Tibet  '59 we got the Dalai Lama out - we  were good, very good.  Then we got  into the Cuban thing.  Not so good.   Set up all the bases for the invasion  supposed to take place in October  '62.  Khrushchev sent the missiles  to resist the invasion, Kennedy  refused to invade and we were standing  out there with our dicks in the wind.   Lot of pissed-off people, Mr.   Garrison, you understand?  I'll come  to that later... I spent much of  September '63 working on the Kennedy  plan for getting all U.S.  personnel  out of Vietnam by the end of '65.   This plan was one of the strongest  and most important papers issued  from the Kennedy White House.  Our  first 1,000 troops were ordered home  for Christmas.  Tensions were high.

The Warren Commission  thought they had an open and shut  case: three bullets, one assassin -  but two things happened that made it  virtually impossible: 1)the Zapruder  film which you just saw, and 2)the  third wounded man, Jim Tague, who  was nicked by a fragment down by the  Triple Underpass.  The time frame of  5.6 seconds established by the  Zapruder film left no possibility of  a fourth shot from Oswald's rifle,  but the shot or fragment that left a  superficial wound on Tague's cheek  had to come from a bullet that missed  the car entirely.  Now they had two  bullets that hit, and we know one of  them was the fatal head shot.  So a  single bullet remained to account  for all seven wounds in Kennedy and  Connally.  But rather than admit to  a conspiracy or investigate further,  the Commission chose to endorse the  theory put forth by an ambitious  junior counsellor, Arlen Specter.   One of the grossest lies ever forced  on the American people, we've come  to know it as the \"magic bullet\"  theory."

It then  moves upward in order to leave  Kennedy's body from the front of his  neck - his neck wound number two -  where it waits 1.6 seconds, turns  right and continues into Connally's  body at the rear of his right armpit -  wound number three.  Then, the bullet  heads downward at an angle of 27  degrees, shattering Connally's fifth  rib and leaving from the right side  of his chest - wounds four and five.   The bullet continues downward and  then enters Connally's right wrist -  wound number six - shattering the  radius bone.  It then enters his  left thigh - wound number seven -  from which it later falls out and is  found in almost \"pristine\" condition  on a stretcher in a corridor of  Parkland Hospital. (he shows a mock-up  of the \"pristine\"  bullet) That's some bullet.  Anyone who's  been in combat can tell you never in  the history of gunfire has there  been a bullet like this. (the court laughs) The Army Wound Ballistics experts at  Edgewood Arsenal fired some comparison  bullets and not one of them looked  anything like this one. (he shows mock-ups of  comparison bullets) Take a look at CE 856, an identical  bullet fired through the wrist of a  human cadaver - just one of the bones  smashed by the magic bullet.  Yet  the government says it can prove  this with some fancy physics in a  nuclear laboratory.  Of course they  can.  Theoretical physics can prove  an elephant can hang from a cliff  with it's tail tied to a daisy, but  use your eyes - your common sense - (he holds the bullet) Seven wounds, skin, bone.  This single  bullet explanation is the foundation  of the Warren Commission's claim of  a lone assassin.  And once you  conclude the magic bullet could not  create all seven of those wounds,  you have to conclude there was a  fourth shot and a second rifleman.   And if there was a second rifleman,  there had to be a conspiracy, which  we believe involved the accused Clay  Shaw.  Fifty-one witnesses, gentlemen  of the jury, thought they heard shots  coming from the Grassy Knoll, which  is to the right and front of the  President."

Going back to when we were children,  I think most of us in this courtroom  thought that justice came into being  automatically, that virtue was its  own reward, that good would triumph  over evil.  But as we get older we  know that this just isn't true.   \"The frontier is where a man faces a  fact.\"  Individual human beings have  to create justice and this is not  easy because truth often presents a  threat to power and we have to fight  power often at great risk to  ourselves.  People like Julia Ann  Mercer, S.M. Holland, Lee Bowers,  Jean Hill, and Willie O'Keefe have  come forward and taken that risk. (he produces a stack  of letters) I have here some $8000 in these  letters sent to my office from all  over the country - quarters, dimes,  dollar bills from housewives,  plumbers, car salesmen, teachers,  invalids ... These are the people  who cannot afford to send money but  do, these are the ones who drive the  cabs, who nurse in the hospitals,  who see their kids go to Vietnam.   Why?  Because they care, because  they want to know the truth - because  they want their country back, because  it belongs to us the people as long  as the people got the guts to fight  for what they believe in!  The truth  is the most important value we have  because if the truth does not endure,  if the Government murders truth, if  you cannot respect the hearts of  these people... (shaking the letters) ...then this is no longer the country  in which we were born in and this is  not the country I want to die in...   And this was never more true than  for John F. Kennedy whose murder was  probably the most terrible moment in  the history of our country.  You the  people, you the jury system, in  sitting in judgement on Clay Shaw,  represent the hope of humanity against  Government power.  In discharging  your duty, in bringing the first  conviction in this house of cards  against Clay Shaw, \"Ask not what  your country can do for you, but  what you can do for your country.\"   Do not forget your young President  who forfeited his life.
