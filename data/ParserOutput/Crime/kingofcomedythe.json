It is dusk and the show is about to break. There is a very small crowd already positioned at the stage door -- a few young girls, a few curious passers-by who have stopped to see who will emerge. Three professional autograph hunters are clustered together: MAE, a lady in her sixties, wears a red velvet dress, a lace hat and much too much rouge. SIDNEY is in his mid-twenties, tall, badly-complexioned, slicked hair but otherwise neatly dressed. He carries a brown lunch bag. CELESTE is an enormously fat woman in her mid-thirties. She wears a large cape to conceal her obesity. A middle-aged MAN, dressed in a corduroy suit,    emerges from the backstage door which is guarded by a    large, white-haired POLICEMAN. The non-professionals     in the crowd just peer at the MAN but MAE immediately    steps i front of him with her autograph book raised."

The bottle stops right in front of PUPKIN who takes it and slides it back with equal force. At this moment, the THIR MAN in the middle has finished his sip and has just place the THIRD MAN's glass on the counter. The beer bottle collides with the THIRD MAN's glass, creating a mess. RIT glares at PUPKIN as does the THIRD MAN. PUPKIN shrugs an apology and RITA cleans up the mess."

There is a specia Kennedy section -- John F. and Bobby framed in black, Jackie in mourning and a picture of Teddy. There is also trio of assassins -- Sirhan, Oswald and James Earl Ray.

When I was principal at Clifton High and these two were students, I had very little faith that Rupert here would amount to very much. But like his teachers and his fellow students, I underestimated this fine young man.   Some say that this misjudgment is directly tied to my recent dismissal as head of the Clifton School System. But let me take this opportunity to set the record straight. Knowing that Rupert and Rita here were most certainly destined for a great career and a lifetime of happiness, I voluntarily stepped down. I would only here add my own wishes to those of millions of viewers for their continued health, wealth and boundless success. The OFFICIAL looks quickly past RITA and PUPKIN."

(laughter) Is there anyone here from Clifton? (silence) Good. We can all relax. Now, I'd like to begin by saying that my parents were too poor to afford me a childhood but the fact is nobody is allowed to be really poor in Clifton. Once you fall below eleven thousand you're exiled to Passaic. My parents did, in fact, put down the first two payments on my childhood. Then they tried to return me to the hospital as defective.   But, like everyone else I grew up in large part thanks to my mother. If she was only here today I'd say, \"Hey, mom. What are you doing here? You've been dead for nine years?\" (laughter) You should have seen my mother. She was wonderful -- blonde, beautiful, intelligent, alcoholic. (laughter) We used to drink milk together after school. Mine was homogenized. Hers was loaded. (laughter) Once she was picked up for speeding. They clocked her doing fifty -- in our garage. (laughter) When they tested her they found that her alcohol was two per cent blood. They took away her license and she died shortly afterwards. We used to joke together Mom and me, until the tears would stream down her face and she'd throw up. (laughter) And who would clean it up? Not Dad. He was too busy down at O'Grady's throwing up on his own. In fact, until I was sixteen, I thought throwing up was a sign of maturity. While the other kids were off in the woods sneaking cigarettes, I was hiding behind the house with my fingers down my throat. (laughter) I never got anywhere until one day, my father caught me. Just as he was giving me a final kick in the stomach, for luck, I managed to heave all over his new shoes. \"That's it,\" I thought. \"I've made it. I'm finally a man!\" (laughter) As it turned out, that was the only time my father ever paid any real attention to me. He was usually too busy out in the park playing ball with my sister, Rose. And, today thanks to those many hours of practice, my sister Rose has grown into a fine man. (laughter) Me, I wasn't especially interested in athletics. The only exercise I ever got was when the other kids picked on me. They used to beat me up once a week, usually Tuesday. After a while, the school worked it into the curriculum. And, if you knocked me out, you got extra credit. (laughter) Except there was this one kid who was afraid of me. I kept telling him, \"Hit me! Hit me! What's the matter with you? Don't you want graduate?\" As for me, I was the only kid in the history of the school to graduate in traction. The school nurse tucked my diploma into my sling. But my only real interest, right from the beginning, was show business. Even as a young man, I began at the very top, collecting autographs. (laughter)"

Right now, Jerry Langford is strapped to a bedstead somewhere in the middle of this city. (laughter) Go ahead. Laugh. But the fact is ... I'm here. Tomorrow you'll know I wasn't kidding and you'll think I was crazy. But I figured it this way: better to be King for a Night than Schmuck for a Lifetime!!! (laughter) Good night ladies and gentlemen.
