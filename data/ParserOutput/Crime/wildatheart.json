I dont know how much or what it  means though I miss you an awful bunch sometimes I know youre thinking about me cause I can feel it.  I miss you not being around to call me peanut nobody else ever called me that. Mama married Santos.  It just about drove me crazy.  My daddy left a lot of money somehow and theyre spending it like there is no tomorrow.  Im going to move out as soon as I can. Mama and Santos said because of the baby theyre lookin at the two of us in a different light - whatever that means. Johnnie Farragut has plumb disappeared.  No one knows where.
