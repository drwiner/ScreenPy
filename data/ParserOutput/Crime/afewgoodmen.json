And if  that's the situation, that's fine, I  won't tell anyone. But my feeling is  that if this case is handled in the  same fast-food, slick-ass, Persian  Bazaar manner with which you seem to  handle everything else, something's  gonna get missed.

They woke him up, tied his arms and  legs with rope, and forced a rag  into his throat. A few minutes later,  a chemical reaction in Santiago's  body called lactic acidosis caused  his lungs to begin bleeding. He  drowned in his own blood and was  pronounced dead at 32 minutes past  midnight. These are the facts of the  case. And they are undisputed. That's  right. The story I just told you is  the exact same story you're going to  hear from Corporal Dawson, and it's  the exact same story you're going to  hear from Private Downey. Furthermore,  the Government will also demonstrate  that the defendants soaked the rag  with poison, and entered Santiago's  room with motive and intent to kill. (beat) Now, Lt. Kaffee, is gonna try to  pull off a little magic act, he's  gonna try a little misdirection.  He's going to astonish you with  stories of rituals and dazzle you  with official sounding terms like  Code Red. He might even cut into a  few officers for you. He'll have no  evidence, mind you, none. But it's  gonna be entertaining. When we get  to the end, all the magic in the  world will not have been able to  divert your attention from the fact  that Willy Santiago is dead, and  Dawson and Downey killed him. These  are the facts of the case. (beat) And they are undisputed."

It's because it  was what they were ordered to do. (beat) Let me say that again: It's because  it was what they were ordered to do.  Now, out in the real world, that  means nothing.
