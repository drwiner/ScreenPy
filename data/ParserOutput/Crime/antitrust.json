Indeed, Gary has spared expense for the toddlers: they're flat, sleek, digital  screens. At the moment, they show colorful, childish cont drawings that say WHERE I WANNA WORK (e.g.: a spaceship). There are a dozen more screens on tables at the perimeter the room showing screensavers (eg: angelfish swimming). Milo moves slowly around the table, studying the screens. Not surprisingly, most of the WHERE I WANNA WORK drawings are of desks or tables with computers. Tracking just ahead of Milo, we get to a screen that show workstation with a red pennant on the wall, a rubber plan at each end of a desk. Even in contour form it's -- famil Milo passes it. And comes back to it. Staring at it, he sits. He begins typing. [The drawing st occupies the screen, but in a window he's brought up at t bottom, there is dense, DOS-looking code.] He types furio numbers, symbols, backslashes. Whatever he's trying to do a challenge even to him. He deletes lines, begins anew, h frustration evident. As he works through the layers of code, the pixels on the screen start to fill in. The contour lines slowly dissolv into a live broadcast image of Teddy's workstation in  Sunnyvale (eerily empty, now). When all the pixels have fallen into place, Milo hears CL CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK from every direction, as all the  screens in the room fill in with live broadcast images. A of them show variations on a theme: A workstation seen by a camera over-the-shoulder of a  programmer (if he were present). The stations are of vari shapes and sizes, but in each case we have an unobstructe view of screen & keyboard. At this hour, few programmers present. One guy has fallen asleep, his head on a desk.
