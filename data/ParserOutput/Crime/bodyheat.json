The gun BLASTS once. One small window in the front door shatters and the bulle continues into the night. Edmund's revolver slides across the hall floor into a corner. Edmund is on the floor, blood pouring from his scalp. But he is coming on like a crazed beast. His glasses askew, but still on his head, he has grasped Racine aroun the legs. With a powerful lunge, he pulls Racine's legs out. Racine crashes to the hall floor, losing the wooden plank. Matty, frozen at the stair railing, cries out. Edmund is pulling Racine toward him with all his might, crawling up Racine's body as they both slide on the wood floor. Edmund reaches out one huge hand, and pulls Racine even closer. Racine puts his left hand into Edmund's face, his thumb flat against the lens of Edmund's glasses and pushes his head back. The glasses fly away and Racine loses his hold. Edmund comes on. Racine's right hand gropes -- gropes -- finds the wooden plank. He swings it up. The wooden plank describes a perfect arc into our view, and then out, finding its mark with a HORRIBLE THUD. Matty, up the stairs, turns away. Racine falls back on the floor. Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org               72."

As he does he looks down a connecting hallway. He sees movement. He snatches up the flashlight and the wooden plank and rushes down that hallway. AT THE END OF THE HALLWAY, Racine slides to a halt, breathing hard. Again he sees the movement. A horrible, sweaty figure confronts him -- there is a broken mirror attached to the wall.

It is Edmund's Cadillac, glowing in the moonlight. The Cadillac stops in front of the house and for several moments nothing happens. Then Matty gets out of the car Waterway. She is wearing the same white dress she was wearing when Racine first saw her and she is luminous in the moonlight Racine watches from the blackness of the gazebo. Silently Matty walks twenty feet past the gazebo and stops when she can make out the boathouse in the gloom. She stares at it a moment then turns back toward the house. Racine steps to the edge of the gazebo. Matty seems startled for only a split second."
