I don't  like the word confession. I just  want to set you right about one thing  you couldn't see, because it was  smack up against your nose. You think  you're such a hot potato as a claims  manager, such a wolf on a phoney  claim. Well, maybe you are, Keyes,  but let's take a look at this  Dietrichson claim, Accident and Double  Indemnity. You were pretty good in  there for a while, all right. You  said it wasn't an accident. Check.  You said it wasn't suicide. Check.  You said it was murder. Check and  double check. You thought you had it  cold, all wrapped up in tissue paper,  with pink ribbons around it. It was  perfect, except that it wasn't,  because you made a mistake, just one  tiny little mistake. When it came to  picking the killer, you picked the  wrong guy, if you know what I mean.  Want to know who killed Dietrichson?  Hold tight to that cheap cigar of  yours, Keyes. I killed Dietrichson.  Me, Walter Neff, insurance agent, 35  years old, unmarried, no visible  scars -- (He glances down at  his wounded shoulder) Until a little while ago, that is.  Yes, I killed him.

And  suddenly the doorbell rings and the  whole set-up is right there in the  room with you... Look, Keyes, I'm  not trying to whitewash myself. I  fought it, only maybe I didn't fight  it hard enough. The stakes were fifty  thousand dollars, but they were the  life of a man, too, a man who'd never  done me any dirt.
