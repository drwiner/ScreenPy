CLOSE ON: Romeo: his face glows pink. He is sitting on th grubby shoreline of Verona Bay dressed as a boy King Arth with fake chain mail and sword. Romeo watches the dying flare sink into the bay. The soun of the party drifts across the water. Balthasar, dressed Frankenstein's monster, touches a lighter to a large bong and Romeo inhales smoke. Behind them, Benvolio, drunk and dressed as a pizza, is yelling at Gregory, who, dressed as a Viking, is trying t cut slices off his pizza costume. Sampson, also dressed a a Viking, sits in the back of a car. One arm is bandaged and he swigs from a bottle. Suddenly the darkness is slashed by headlights. A reckles sports car speeds toward the boys. Stereo screaming, the car skids to a halt. CLOSE ON: Music blares from the sound system. A silver stilettoed foot emerges from the car and plants itself firmly in the dirt. CUT TO: The boys, eyes wide with amazement. CUT TO: Another stiletto follows the first. Guitar groans PAN: Slowly up a shapely pair of black stockinged legs, p a hint of garter belt to a black sequined mini-skirt and over a muscular dark skinned stomach and tiny sequined br top, to discover: the 21 year old male, African American face of MERCUTIO. CUT TO: The boys. Recovering from the initial shock, they laugh and cat-call raucously. CUT TO: Mercutio. He roughly jams a short black wig onto his head and yells above the music."
