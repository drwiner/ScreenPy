The Compound looks like a walled-off subdivisio most of which we can see from this high up. The landscape is foreign. Scrub desert. Ten miles beyond, the horizon: the shimmer of a modern skyline. Surreal monolithic shapes made more so by the heat. Muted yells-claps-screams waft in from that Compound now. Catches the youngest Grandson's attention. Eyes lift up f his painting: the yells-claps-screams are coming from a softball game mostly visible behind the Compound's reinfo walls that extend a mile in each direction. Played on the only stretch of green grass visible from this vantage."

Takes a deep, measured Sniper's breath, eases the stock snug aimpoint up to his right eye, and without hesitation lets loose the entire c perfectly: one heartbeat before the Mercedes hits the gap The right side of the Mercedes shreds just as it appears. Fleury's clip gone in a flash, yet more rounds still hit Mercedes: Al-Ghazi four feet away, firing his own salvo f a knee. Something bright red pops against the driver's si window now, the Mercedes rip-slides to a stop. Commotion inside. Wild, half-aimed shots back at us. Then it starts up again. Al-Ghazi bolts toward the line o stopped traffic. Searching for something big, empty, stil running. Fleury right on his heels. COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)                   "
