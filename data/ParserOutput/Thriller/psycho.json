We are  close now, so that only the lower half of the window fram is in shot. No sounds come from within the room. Suddenly, we tip downward, go to the narrow space between shade and sill, peep into the room. A young woman is stretched out on the mussed bed. She wea a full slip, stockings, no shoes. She lies in and attitud of physical relaxation, but her face, seen in the dimness the room, betrays a certain inner-tension, worrisome  conflicts.

But slowly, he is forced to surrender to the impulse and, resisting himself, he goes to the wall, presses the side his head against it. The SOUNDS come louder, as if we too had our ear pressed against the wall. Now Norman looks at picture hanging on the far end of the wall he is leaning  against. Slowly he starts toward it. He reaches it, touches it, reluctantly lifts the small fr off the wall. A tiny circle of light hits Norman's face, coming from th hole in the wall behind the picture. This end of the room very dim and thus we are able to see clearly the light  striking Norman's face. We move close to Norman, extremely close, until his profi fills the screen. The tiny spot of light hits his eye. Se the small hole through which the light comes. Norman peep through."

It is ornate, damask-and-mahogany, thick and warm and rip an olla podrida of mismated furnishings and bric-a-brac o the last century. The bed is four poster, but uncanoped; dressing table is fancy and flounced with satin; there is great chiffonier, a big-doored wardrobe, a large, oval, f length pier-glass (this against the wall directly opposit the door), a satin recamier, an upholstered armchair by t window, a white marble fireplace, its grate cold but pile with ashes. And there is in the room an unmistakably live quality, as even though it is presently unoccupied, it has not been l vacated by some musty presence. Lila glances at the bed. The damask coverlet is thrown ov it, but it is not neat, there is the imprint of a body on it, a body which obviously has slept in a curled-up, womb like position. Lila stares at it for a moment, up, then g to the dressing table. Its top is scattered with boxes an jars of cosmetics and creams, traces of fresh powder, an  opened bottle or perfume, a comb, and a brush with traces hair in its bristles. Lila moves on, catches a glimpse of herself in the pier-glass, is startled, turns away, goes the chiffonier, is about to open a drawer, sees the high  wardrobe out of the corner of her eyes, goes to it,  hesitantly. She opens one door. Fresh, clean, well presse dresses hang neatly. Lila opens the other door. The sweat and dresses and robes hang freely, none in moth-proof, st type bags. There is even a well-brushed collar of foxes. Along the floor of the wardrobe is a line of clean, polis shoes. Lila stares, then closes the door, turns, looks on again over the whole room, starts out,"

The bed is small, far too short for a man of Norman's height. And yet the rumpl covers indicate that it is in this bed that Norman sleeps Next to the bed is an old-fashioned toy chest. On its top there are a bird-in-a-cage lamp, a plain-bound book, and ash tray filled with ashes and cigarette stubs. A grown m shirt hangs on a child's clothes tree. Against one wall there is a narrow, high bookcase filled  with thick, unchildish-looking books. On the small, white chest of drawers there is an old, child's victrola. The r on the turntable is discovered, on close inspection, to b Beethoven's Eroica Symphony. Lila studies the room, fascinated and repelled. She glanc at the bookcase, comes into the room, goes to the bookcas and pulls out a thick, large, plain-bound book. She opens it. Her eyes go wide in shock. And then there is disgust. She slams the book closed, drops it."
