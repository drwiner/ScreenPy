Atwood re-checks the number on the Moving Company's Work Order - 517, she's going the wrong way. She turns around. Now Atwood and the Couple are walking toward each other o opposite sides of the Hall. Atwood steps into an area of light. The reflection off her face catches the attention of the who is wearing a wide brimmed hat. He lifts his head. It's Thorton Meeks. The Woman with him was the Driver of Van. She's wearing a watchcap. Meeks gently takes his Companion's arm. They stop. Her ey go to where he's looking and then back to his. At some unspoken signal they both draw their guns. Intent on finding 517 and Baffert, the Couple hasn't registered on Atwood's radar. BANG! TWOCK! A chunk of plaster blows off the wall next t her head. Startled, Atwood winces away. BANG! The Woman fires. The slug explodes the plaster on the other side of Atwood's head. Now Atwood is turning toward them, gun in hand. Meeks fires. The bullet passes through Atwood's jacket."
