It reaches one of her teammates who sets up another to spike it. Chieko's team wins the point. The referee, instead of whistling, lifts up a red flag. The players congratulate each other silently, in sign language. The only sound we can here is the parents' clap as they watch the game from the stands. Chieko's team serves. Again, the game is heated. A rival player spikes the ball, and it is barely out of bounds. However, the referee, with his red flag, calls the point. Chieko is upset and goes to argue with him."
