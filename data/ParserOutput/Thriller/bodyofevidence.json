Yes.  And what a deadly weapon Rebecca Lawson made of it.  The State will prove that Miss Lawson seduced Andrew Marsh -- that she put increasing sexual demands on him while she secretly administered cocaine.

Her fingerprints were found on the nasal spray bottle that contained the cocaine -- and she was the sole beneficiary of Andrew Marsh's will. She planned it from beginning to end.
