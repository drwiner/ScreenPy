As a HEAVY METAL COMBAT BEAT begins to PULSATE ON THE SOUNDTRACK, The Boys and The Bride have a Spaghetti Weste Stand-off. We do a 360 INSIDE the CIRCLE of The Crazy 88, who surrou the yellow-haired warrior. Not all have Samurai swords; o JUGGLES TWO HATCHETS, another TWIRLS A THREE-STAFF TRIPLE IRON over his head. As the Heavy Metal music builds...We Cut to various Shots The Two Opposing Forces Preparing to Strike....Hands on S Handles...Feet finding Combat Stance...etc... ....Until Heavy Metal reaches its Breaking Point... ...At that point, the Metal EXPLODES OVER THE SOUNDTRACK. TIME WITH The BRIDE EXPLODING INTO A VIOLENT KILLING MACH ON SCREEN. As she matches skill with the army of black-suited boys, flailing, silver blade Clashing and Slashing, long blonde hair whipping like a whirling dervish.... ...She's a Goddess of War Venus. Not only is the FIGHT CUT TO THE HEAVY METAL MUSIC, but T Bride seems to be somewhat dancing to it as she fights. This explosion of furious violence is punctuated CINEMATICALLY BY THE COLOR IN THE FILM POPPING OFF, and t fight being filmed in HIGH CONTRAST BLACK AND WHITE, turn the squirting, spewing geysers of BLOOD FROM CRIMSON RED OIL BLACK. Many members of The Crazy 88 are Sliced, Slashed, and liberated from the limbs they were born with at The Bride blade. Some SPECIFIC MOMENTS While Clashing swords, The Bride whips the silver Boomera out of its holster, and Throws it... ....It Twirls Through the Air... ...Embedding itself longways in one of the boy's faces. The Bride does a Mid-Air Somersault over the head of an Attacker, landing solid on her feet behind him...Slash, h Out. The Bride is knocked to the floor, her Attacker stands ov her to Spear the young blonde, Her Legs Spring Up In The Ankles Lock Around The Boy's Neck. She throws him down to the ground. With his neck still in vise-like grip of her ankles, She removes The SOG Knife f its sheath and Plunges it Deep Into The Boy's Chest. While still on the ground, an Attacker Charges at her. Yanking the Boomerang out of the Dead Boy's Face, She Sen It Flying in the Charging Man's path... ...Boomerang Twirling Through the Air Close to the Ground ...Chopping Off the Charging Attacker's Foot in Mid Step, falls flat. The Bride jumps up onto an attacker's shoulders. She lock her legs around him so he's helpless at shaking her off. ...she swings down with her sword, and cuts the man's han off. So while the helpless man with no hands screams, the now foot tall Bride fights with the others. When she's through she brings the blade across the man sh perched on's throat. He falls to his knees, bringing the Bride back to the floor like an alevator. As soon as her soles touch ground, she's off his shoulder somersaulting on the floor, bringing her blade up between attacker's legs into his groin. He lets out a scream, as she yanks her blade free. ONE ATTACKER steps out from the rest, \"The Best One.\" He Twirls his sword expertly, challenging the young woman to \"Come get a piece.\" The Bride does a screaming charge towards him.... ...Sword raised, The Attacker stands his ground, calm - steady, waiting for the blonde-haired locomotive to collide.....They meet....."

And last not least, The Bride, bound and gagged, lying in the flat of Budd's pickup. The BRIDE She begins to come to from the shot in her arm. Some dried blood lies caked around her wounds. Rope binds wrists tightly together in front of her. A big leather cowboy belt is wrapped tight around her che brown cowboy boots. Her eyelids flutter open...and she se stars. A giant, black Texas night sky full of them. She has no idea where she is. She turns her head to the left and sees, Back window and Cab of truck. She turns her head to the right and sees, Hatch Gate to flatbed. She listens...she hears, Crickets...The sound of Two Men Digging...One of the Men something to the other in Spanish... THEN... She hears one of the Shovels HIT something buried... The Two Men speak to each other in Unsubtitled Spanish... THEN... We hear them Lifting something heavy, we might assume is coffin. The Bride however knows not what to think. BOOM...They set it down. She hears boots approaching the flatbed, The crunching of leaves leading in her direction... TILL... With a CLANG and a SCRAPE the latches on the Gate of the flatbed are Yanked Out, and it lowers open with a CRASH. Revealing Budd, looking down on her. BUDD"

Was it the intention of the Shaolin monk to insult Pai Mei? Or, did he just fail to see the generous social gesture? The motives of the monk, remain, unknown. What is known, were the consequences. The next morning Pai Mei appeared at the Shaolin Temple, and demanded that the temple's head Abbot offer Pai Mei his neck, to repay the insult. The Abbot, at first, tried to console Pai Mei, only to find, Pai Mei was inconsolable. So began, the massacre of the Shaolin Temple, and all sixty of the monks inside, at the fists of the White Lotus. And so began, the legend of Pai Mei's Ten-Point Palm - Exploding Heart Technique.

Listen to this, (reading from the notepad) \"...In Africa, the saying goes, in the bush, an elephant can kill you. A leopard can kill you. And a Black Mamba can kill you. But only with the Mamba, and this has been true in Africa since the dawn of time, is death sure. Hence its handle; Death Incarnate.\" (looking up from the paper) Pretty cool, huh? (back to paper) \"...Its neurotoxic venom is one of nature's most effective poisons, acting on the nervous system causing paralysis. The venom of a Black Mamba can kill a human in four hours, if say bitten on the ankle or the thumb. However, a bite to the face or torso can bring death from paralysis within twenty minutes. (up from paper to Budd) Now you should listen to this cause this concerns you. (reading from the paper) The amount of venom that can be delivered from a single bit can be gargantuan. (looks up from paper) -- You know I've always liked that word Gargantuan, and I so rarely have an opportunity to use it in a sentence. (back to paper) \"If not treated quickly with anti venom, 10 to 15 milligrams can be fatal to human beings. However, the Black Mamba can deliver as much as 100 to 400 milligrams of venom from a single bite.\" Elle finishes reading and puts the paper away.

She dips the tip of the blade in the blood, leaving the tiniest of crimson smudges. She then removes the Bill handkerchief, and wipes Bill's blood from off the blade onto the white cloth. She lets the Bill handkerchief drop onto his body. The Jingi sword Hattori Hanzo created, just for her, for purpose, has come to the end of its journey.

The tear is for her as well. she's very aware she    will never ever be completely any man's WOMAN.
