HALLENBECK, CONFIDENTIAL INVESTIGATIONS. On the lawn, a late-model Plymouth. The sprinkers come to life. Fling water across the car."

The ball sits there.    Only slightly scorched. Tentatively, almost like he's afraid of being caught, one of the boys bends down... looks both ways... Picks up the ball.    Smiles. Then, as if by some unspoken agreement -- The other boy starts to run. Slowly at first, then faster... faster still... A slant pattern, heading for the mailbox... And at 12 midnight on December 22nd, the San Pedro Street quarterback throws an absolutely perfect pass. Their laughter is joyful.    Innocent.    Fervid. They will grow up to be sports heroes."
