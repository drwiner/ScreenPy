A train of cars trundling down the ramp, bumper to bu B.  Young Beautiful People from Princeton, Yale, NYU, wea knapsacks, toting luggage, babies riding in papoose rigs, energized children, senior citizens holding hands on the  pedestrian ramp, a few wheelchairs.

Brody: \"All I get is a recording. Is there some other number I could try...?\" J.  Station wagons with pale winter faces pressed anxious to the window. Cadillacs with Rear Admirals at the helm,  their wives with blue hair remembering the way from years before. K.  Hooper: \"When did he check out? Did he leave another  phone number?\" L.  Brody: \"How can I reach him in Chambers if he's not i Chambers?\" M.  Little Karate Hands breaking picket fences. N.

They all wear Men's Club Lifeguard patches and  matching collegiate windbreakers. They scour the landing, looking for someone to save. The boat is empty.

We was  still under sealed orders after  deliverin' the bomb...the Hiroshima  bomb...we was goin' back across the  Pacific from Tinian to Leyte. Damn  near eleven hundred men went over  the side. The life boats was lashed  down so tight to make the bomb run  we couldn't cut a single one adrift.  Not one. And there was no rafts.  None. That vessel sank in twelve  minutes. Yes, that's all she took.  We didn't see the first shark till  we'd been in the water about an hour.  A thirteen-footer near enough. A  blue. You measure that by judgin'  the dorsal to the tail. What we didn't  know... of course the Captain knew...I  guess some officers knew... was the  bomb mission had been so secret, no  distress signals was sent. What the  men didn't know was that they wouldn't  even list us as overdue for a week.  Well, I didn't know that -- I wasn't  an officer -- just as well perhaps.  So some of us were dead already --  in the water -- just hangin' limp in  our lifejackets. And several already  bleedin'. And the three hundred or  so laying on the bottom of the ocean.  As the light went, the sharks came  crusin'. We formed tight groups --  somewhat like squares in an old battle --  You know what I mean -- so that when  one come close, the man nearest would  yell and shout and pound the water  and sometimes it worked and the fish  turned away, but other times that  shark would seem to look right at a  man -- right into his eyes -- and in  spite of all shoutin' and poundin'  you'd hear that terrible high  screamin' and the ocean would go  red, then churn up as they ripped  him.  Then we'd reform our little  squares. By the first dawn the sharks  had taken more than a hundred. Hard  for me to count but more than a  hundred. I don't know how many sharks.  Maybe a thousand. I do know they  averaged six men an hour. All kinds --  blues, makos, tigers. All kinds. (Pause) In the middle of the second day,  some of us started to go crazy from  the thirst. One fella cried out he  saw a river, another claimed he saw  a waterfall, some started to drink  the ocean and choked on it, and some  left our little groups -- our little  squares -- and swam off alone lookin'  for islands and the sharks always  took them right away. It was mainly  the young fellas that did that --  the older ones stayed where they  was. That second day -- my life jacket  rubbed me raw and that was more blood  in the water. Oh my. On Thursday  morning I bumped up against a friend  of mine -- Herbie Robinson from  Cleveland -- a bosun's mate -- it  seemed he was asleep but when I  reached over to waken him, he bobbed  in the water and I saw his body upend  because he'd been bitten in half  beneath the waist. Well Chief, so it  went on -- bombers high overhead but  nobody noticin' us. Yes -- suicides,  sharks, and all this goin' crazy and  dyin' of thirst. Noon the fifth day,  Mr. Hooper, a Lockheed Ventura swung  around and came in low. Yes. He did  that. Yes, that pilot saw us. And  early evenin', a big fat PBY come  down out of the sky and began the  pickup.  That was when I was most  frightened of all -- while I was  waitin' for my turn. Just two and a  half hours short of five days and  five nights when they got to me and  took me up. Eleven hundred of us  went into that ocean -- three hundred  and sixteen got out. Yeah. Nineteen  hundred and forty five. June the  29th. (pause) Anyway, we delivered the bomb."

Qu footing falters and slips, he stumbles at the Mouth of He the big teeth seize him and snap. Quint's roar of rage and pain is choked off as his body i clamped between the grinding, sawing teeth, and his head legs suddenly contort as the shark's teeth meet across hi torso. Blood gushes onto the deck. The remnants of his bo tumble from the shark's mouth. Brody sees the horror, hears the screams -- in his  desperation, he tears loose one of Hooper's remaining air tanks, and hurls it at the monster. It tumbles into the b well, wedging across the back of the mouth, the thick ste blocking the cruel jaws. The shark's head shakes even more violently, trying to cl the cold iron, but the tank is in to stay."
