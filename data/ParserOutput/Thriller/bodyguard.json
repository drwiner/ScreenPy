As Tony reaches out to lift him by his shirt, Frank spins low out of his seat. Tony's legs are knocked out from under him. He lands hard on his back and finds himself looking up at Frank, who holds him down with the chair he was sitting on, like a lion tamer, a leg strut pressed against Tony's throat. Frank looks down at him question- ingly, as if to ask, \"Had enough?\" Tony scowls and nods. Frank lifts the chair away. Tony stands up and faces him. Frank turns away and Tony throws a punch at his head, barely catching him as Frank ducks and moves in under it. He hits Tony twice and throws him against a cabinet. Tony gets up slowly, looks around and grabs a carving knife from a hook on the wall. He holds it in front of him threateningly. Frank shakes his head. He's getting irritated. He picks up the knife he's been using on the peach and flips it in his hand so he's holding it by the blade. With the same fluid motion we've seen earlier, he throws it at Tony. It sticks in the wall an inch from Tony's ear. Tony does a slow take and then lowers his blade. Frank picks up his dirty dish and takes it to the sink. He glances at Tony."

His breath billows out of the mouth hole, whitening in the cool March air. He hears Frank APPROACHING and points his gun in the direction of the FOOTSTEPS.  He does not fire. SILENCE. Frank stops and rests on his haunches. Listening, he hears the intruder move. The sounds have stopped up ahead. Close. The figure peers into the fog, gun up.   He's ready, confident. He waits. Nothing. Frank, from his crouch, does something brand-new. He raises his gun into the fog in a two-handed grip, ready to fire. He holds it easily. And then he does something really strange: Frank closes his eyes. After a beat, we hear MOVEMENT. Frank, eyes still closed, swings his gun 15 degrees and FIRES TWO BLASTS. The man jumps away from a small tree that has splintered six inches from his shoulder. His eyes are wild behind his ski mask. Frightened, he suddenly crashes away in the opposite direction.
