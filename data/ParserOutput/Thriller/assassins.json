Outside there is a beautiful stone church decorated for Christmas.  He watches the snowflakes drift to the distant street below. He is wondering what it would feel like to let himself fall, when there is a KNOCK at the door. Crossing the room, he opens the door.  Backlit by the bright hallway light is a WOMAN.  She has already removed her coat and though she is only a silhouette we can see that her dress is very short and very tight."

A pretty waitress sets a steaming loaf of garlic bread out and a giant bowl of minestrone i front of Leevio.  He tells her something and she giggles. They joke in Italian, watching her ass as she wiggles bac to the kitchen. At Leevio's table the wine steward returns to fill their glasses. It is the goon standing against the wall that is the firs to realize that it is not the same wine steward.  He is the second assassin, much younger than Rath.  His name is BAIN.  He smiles.

He is wearing an airport security uniform, a gun holstere to his side. Taped inside the newspaper is a faxed Interpol photograph of a Japanese man wanted for \"industrial espionage.\" At the gate, five Japanese men emerge.  Leading the group is the man in Rath's photo.  The other four are obviously muscle. Rath watches as they walk down the crowded terminal hall. When they are almost out of sight, he folds his newspaper and begins to follow. His pace and manner is that of a cautious predator.  His focus shifts continually from face to face, expecting to find Bain's. His hand hovers near his gun. Ahead of him a thin young man, wearing a long blue trench coat, stops.  Rath cannot see his face. The man starts toward a drinking fountain. Rath catches a glimpse of his face.  It could be Bain, bu he isn't sure. The young man bends over and slurps at the stream of water.  He rises into the barrel of Rath's .22. A mouthful of water coughs from his mouth. It is not Bain and in the next instant, the gun is gone."

It is a very similar set up to Rath's, only it has been put together with a fraction of the resources. Bain sits, typing at the computer, his shirt off.  Beside the desk-top is a six pack of Old Style beer, a bag of Doritos and his Gameboy. On the floor, disassembled neatly on a small white towel is his cleaned gun. Bain finishes punching in a code, sits back and sucks dow his beer."

He smiles. He assembles it quickly, snapping it together with automatic ease.  When the sight is tightened in place, he jumps up. In the mirror over the dresser, he poses down with the gun. Not satisfied, he grabs his shades and checks himself again.  He starts moving with the music, playing with the gun, first as a guitar, then whipping it around, spinning it expertly, like a drum and bugle corpsman.  The gun zip and flashes around as he whirls in place, then freezes. The butt of the rifle to his shoulder, he peers down the scope at his own head reflected in the mirror.

Seeing Rath exposed on the stairs, Bain whips around and FIRES, the WALL SHREDDING behind Rath as he dives back down into the shadows. Ripping open Bain's duffel bag Electra grabs Bain's .22. Bain advances steadily, the rifle trained on the door. Inside the room Electra grunts, hurling the duffel bag ou the door.  It spins over the balcony and plummets to the ground and bursts open. A GUN CLIP SKITTERS across the stone tile coming to rest in the middle of the courtyard. Rath and Bain both see it. Staying hidden, Rath immediately circles towards it. Bain sweats, looking at the door, down at the clip, then back at the door.  Something's got to give. Unsure what to do Electra waits, the gun clenched between her two hands, covering the empty, dark space of the door Bain makes his choice, moving towards room 502. Rath sees that Bain is going after Electra.  He takes a slow breath and tears from the shadows -- Bolting into the open, Rath is focused wholly on the clip the ground a blur beneath him -- Bain reacts; the rifle swings, rushing, arcing after Rath Two more steps and Rath dives, sliding, snagging the clip as -- The RIFLE SPITS -- Rath screams, his leg erupting with blood."

Electra moves towards the door aiming at every sound, at every dark corner.  She is almost there when we see Bain, a shadow coming to life, emerging behind her. Lumbering, Rath is halfway there, his eyes riveted on the door to room 502. Hearing Bain, Electra turns.  In one smooth motion, he snatches her arm and breaks her wrist.  The gun falls. Rath hears her scream. Electra kicks at his groin but he drops, leg sweeping her to the ground. She gropes for the gun when he kicks her in the face, jack-knifing her body back, knocking her unconscious. Bain grabs the gun. Rath whips into the room BLASTING -- BULLETS CHASING Bain as he disappears into a blackened hole. Rath goes to Electra not knowing if she is alive or dead. Gently he turns her, cradling her head, her face, smeared with blood. From within the labyrinth, Rath hears BAIN begin to LAUGH"
