She cocks wrist back and hurls the tool, snaps it just like her dad taught her to play baseball. The wrench flies up and across the house. With a CRUNCH, it catches Chuckie right in the collar bon right side. He screams. Drops the flashlight. Drops to his knees hold his throat. Della snaps the tool box shut and makes a run for it. She throws herself up onto the first floor and darts between Tomas and Huey. Huey lunges for her but trips over a loose plank, lands w his face down, biting on the plank's edge. Della catches a peripheral glimpse of Tomas leaping towar her, but his leading foot slams down instead onto the bac Huey's neck. Grinds Huey's face into the plank with a hid THUD. Huey's neck SNAPS back smiley style. Huey's scream gurgles into the night. Huey's body falls through the spa in the floorboards landing with a thud in the foundations below. Tomas falls away, cursing in horror."

She sees that the male figure is slightly separate. That the children stick figures have frightened eyes and cling to the female. That the sky is turbulent. stars clear and bright. The words... A tear escapes from underneath her eyelid. Then another. sob. She might never see her kids again. Another sob. She heaves with the release of emotion. More tears escape. Another sob. She tries to bite it back Wills herself to stop. Finds that rage takes sorrow's place. Rage and self recrimination. Goddamit! She's gonna be raped and killed because of some stupid note!
