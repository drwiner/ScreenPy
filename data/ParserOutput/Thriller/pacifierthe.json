Lulu has a basket in her lap -- inside: GARY THE DUCK and his new family, the most adorable ducklings you ever saw. They all watch, rapt. You Are Sixteen begins. Shane watches with bated breath. Todd spins. In SLOW MOTION, he leaps into the SPIN KICK. It's fantastic -- a Michael Jordan dunk. The AUDIENCE goes nuts, Shane stands, and shouts:"
