Wearing a long coat and, despite the night, sunglasses, h pauses on the slimy asphalt and gazes up the sides of the flophouses, to their yellowish windows and competing Mexi radio stations. One window, dark and quiet on the third f catches his gaze. There's a metal hand railing in the alley that the long-c figure effortlessly pops up onto.

Anyway, it was settled  when the bishops of the world got to  together at the Council of Nicene in  325 and hashed out the various  interpretations of scripture into a  uniform dogma of belief. The result  was the Nicene Creed, which basically  said that Christ was in fact the  same as God and was owed the same  power and respect as the Father.  That they were the same.

Gabriel, a shattered, broken thing, pulls himself up to h knees. The sunglasses are gone and two eyeless pits stare out at Mary, huddled in the corner.
