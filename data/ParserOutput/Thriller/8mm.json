Looks like a hot room.  We only ever see three walls.  The once beautiful girl looks worn, drugged, dark circles under her eyes, staring blankly.  The CAMERA'S tungsten SPOTLIGHT casts long, shifting shadows as the camera moves, but the girl still stares oblivious.  The bed is wrapped in PLASTIC an DUCT TAPE.  The floor is covered by PLASTIC SHEETING... Welles watches, crossing his arms, already uncomfortable. ON THE WALL: a door opens behind the girl, looks like a bathroom, and a MASKED MAN enters. The Masked Man wears a garish, Mexican WRESTLING MASK wit eye holes and a mouth.  The mask covers his entire head. He's naked except for red shorts, his body scrawny, oiled pale.  The man goes to stand in front of the girl.  He se to be saying something to her, but the film is silent and the ONLY SOUND is the PROJECTOR'S LOUD sprocket hole CLATTER.  It's all one long take.  The CAMERA MOVES to fa the girl... Welles sits straight in his chair, wary. ON THE WALL: Masked Man raises his open hand and SLAPS th girl, knocking her back on the bed... Welles grimaces. ON THE WALL: Masked Man pulls the girl back to a seated position.  The girl's like a rag doll, face reddened, eye closed, but she remains upright.  Masked Man uses his thu to open her unseeing eyes.  He touches her mouth with his fingers, presses his lips to hers.  Then, Masked Man back away, leaving frame, till the CAMERA MOVES to find Masked Man standing at a table with THREE large BOWIE KNIFES lai out.  Masked Man runs his fingers over the blades... Welles rises slowly, still watching. ON THE WALL: Masked Man selects a huge Bowie knife and mo back towards the girl... Welles crosses his arms tight, disbelieving, fearful."

Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.

Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes.  Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations.  Interstate wire transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows?
