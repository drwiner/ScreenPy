As the sheetrock tears away, we see the skeleton of the w behind it.  There's a latticework of two by four studs, a beyond those the dull shine of the wall's metal core. But that's not what he's after.  He continues tearing, reveals an air duct running through the wall, feeding int the panic room through a welded hole in the steel.  Burnh tears away with the hammer, exposing a short section of t duct. CLANG!  The claw hammer drops into an opened toolbox. Burnham drops to his knees, rips open another tool case. This one has a sophisticated looking power drill in it, a with a couple dozen specialized bits.  He selects one, tw it into the drill. At the wall, Burnham puts drill to metal and hits the swi A horrendous METAL SCREECH fills the air and the drill bi tears into the duct, opening up a jagged hole about the s of a quarter. Raoul hurries through the doorway of the bedroom, carryin coiled garden hose.  Burnham snaps his fingers for it, Ra tosses it to him, holding one end, and the hose uncoils i the air as it snakes across the room. Burnham shoves the end of the garden hose into the hole h just drilled in the air duct. RIP!  He tears off a length of duct tape and seals the connection, makes it airtight. SLIT!  Using a large hunting knife, Raoul hacks a ten foo section of the garden hose off the coil. He stretches it out, across the room, to the white five gallon tank we saw before, which is now sitting on the fl up here.
