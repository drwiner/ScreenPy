Painfully. He stands up, then steps forward. As Josh and Renai watch his KNEE begins to BEND BACKWARDS, the tendons stretching snapping, the knee bending in the opposite direction. His other knee follows and he steps forward - both knees bending back. Specs is rigid in his chair, rooted to the spot, notepad still in hand. When he looks up at Dalton, the flashlight under his chin shines in Dalton's eyes. Dalton ROARS and advances forward - SLAPPING Specs with t force of ten men. Specs reels backwards, hitting the wall smashing his head and crumpling like paper. Elise stands to face Dalton.
