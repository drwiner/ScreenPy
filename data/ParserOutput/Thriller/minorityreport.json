Kids burst out of the houses, and zoom down sidewalks on trikes.  Mothers in bright dresses stand in doorways, watching.  The smiling mothers wave to one another, then back into their houses. Dogs bark, birds sing in trees of just the right height, boys and girls laugh and ring the bells on their trikes. is a delicious world, where dogs and birds and children a safe."
