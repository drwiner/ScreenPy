At this command, his men move-- Aufidius steps back as-- The Volscian thugs attack-- With knives, machetes and tire irons-- Coriolanus fights bravely -- disarming two, grabbing thei weapons, killing them, fighting back-- Slashing and cutting his way through the killers- Closer and closer to Aufidius, who just watches-- Blood spattering and spraying- But the thugs overpower Coriolanus, there are just too ma 106. They stab him -- slicing with knives -- battering with ch and clubs -- finally emptying pistols him into him-- It is graceless and brutal carnage. Slaughter. But still he comes on. Body riddled with bullets and cut bits. He refuses to fall. Like something immortal. An obs demon of blood. Finally the thugs move away. Coriolanus still stands. Teetering. His face is a swollen mask of blood and gore. Blood flows from his body, poolin around his feet, spreading across the parking lot. Aufidius steps forward. What is left of Coriolanus glares at him through blood. Aufidius slowly pulls his knife. The same knife he was sharpening so carefully at the opening of the story. It h finally found its purpose. Coriolanus looks at him. Then slowly Coriolanus tries to raise one bleeding arm this requires superhuman effort his slashed fingers clutch his shirt he rips it open exposing his breast. Ready. He locks eyes with Aufidius. Aufidius steps to him. Takes his neck. Pulls him onto the knife. Driving it into him. Cradling his head like a love They stand like this. Then Coriolanus falls. A pause.
