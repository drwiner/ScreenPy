As it burns we see that it is the  same picture of Abby's and Ray's \"corpses\" as Visser show Marty, except that in this print the bullet holes and blo are less convincingly brushed in. Another print is dropped into the tray and ignites. In th one we see bullet holes but no blood. A third print is dropped in and ignites. It is the origin undoctored shot of Abby and Ray asleep in bed. Visser's hands enter frame holding the picture-envelope t he took away from Marty's office. Visser rips it in half is about to drop it into the tray, but stops abruptly. There is posterboard, not a photograph, peeking out of th torn envelope.
