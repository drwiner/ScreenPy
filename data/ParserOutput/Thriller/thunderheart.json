And it is spectacular. The DRUM, pounds deeper, bigger, as the sun gets higher.  Stronger. Igniting a vast landscape of gentle slopes and  foothills; throwing shadows on the plains that look like, the Indians say, an old man dancing. The grass is golden. And high. The wind moves through it, snakes through it.  Slowly. BEGIN CREDITS. Voices; a TRADITIONAL INDIAN SONG (Lakota), summoning Wak Tanka - The Great Mystery. And now, rising up over one of the small land waves, a he comes into view. Shoulders. A man, running in ghostly SLO MOTION, his long black hair trailing in the wind. The IND MAN wears only buckskin pants and a bone choker around hi neck. Legs and arms churning, the man runs with antelope grace, backlit by the sunrise, bounding toward us. Running... hi heart pounding. SONG RISING... DRUM POUNDING... FIVE MORE VOICES in high-pitched tremolo join the song. And then the runner soars, like an eagle from a bluff,  airborne, flying over a small dip, arms outstretched, and would be a wondrous thing if there were not a fine, crims mist all around him and if slow motion was not suddenly  overtaken by LIVE SPEED, revealing the brutal force of gu which has slammed the Indian into the air, throwing him.  Slamming him hard into the grass. And it is over as quick and violently as a deer shot dead. LAKOTA SONG ends abruptly."

He looks at this sniffs it. There is a te water-torture like tempo coming from the old pump where w barely drips onto a hub cap in the dirt. Ray sets the boo down. Goes to grab the other boot and -- a WESTERN DIAMOND BACK RATTLER coils out from the shade o the boot, RATTLING and HISSING from white mouth and three inch fangs, and Ray has done a backflip and roll, slappin his shoulder holster and pulling lead and BLAM! BLAAAM! h unloads two, and the reptile is so dead, there's not even enough snake left to make a truck-stop key chain. He kneels there, flushed in the face, holding his breath double-clutching his gun. The SHOTS ECHO through the Badl like the aftermath of dynamite. From inside the trailer, can hear CRYING. A low moaning. Praying softly."

There is a black and white TV with Sesame Stre wailing, honking and guffawing through static. Grandpa fixes his eyes on Ray for only split seconds at a time but one gets the feeling he's doing an incredibly de reading of the young man. Slowly, he sits up -- focusing  intensely on Ray. He begins to speak. A hoarse, strained, string of LAKOTA, spoken like it used to be, gesturing toward Ray. When he  finishes, he sits back in his chair. Ray looks intrigued."
