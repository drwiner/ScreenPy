Doug scrambles up from under the table with the pencil dangling from his chin, knocking over his chair in the process. The tranquility of the library is destroyed by the flabbergasted reactions of the students. Eleanor is momentarily concerned about his welfare, but she cannot help but laugh, too."

Poor Lloyd -- I felt sorry for him. He'd have a cup of coffee with Mother and me. If a doorknob had come off he'd fix it. He'd carry the garbage cans to the curb. Someone dies, people try to be helpful. But he was by here so often that people started to talk. It was fairly obvious that he wanted something more from me than just a cup of coffee. I suggested that he didn't need to stop by here so often, but... then one afternoon I was at Woolworth's, having lunch at the counter. All of sudden Joan Abbott was standing there -- screaming and yelling at me to stop sleeping with her husband, with Lloyd. I was speechless. She was gone before I could find my tongue.
