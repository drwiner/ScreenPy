He is wearin pinky ring, a dark suit, a gold watch, and, on his face, mustache and a look of incredible seriousness. Loretta is Italian, 37. Her black hair, done in a dated style, is fl with grey.

And when that  happens, when I look out among those  chairs and look at a young woman's  face, and see me there in her eyes,  me the way I always wanted to be and  maybe once was, then I ask her out  on a date. It doesn't last. It can  go for a few weeks or a couple of  precious months, but then she catches  on that I'm just a burnt out old  gasbag and that she's as fresh and  bright and full of promise as  moonlight in a martini.
