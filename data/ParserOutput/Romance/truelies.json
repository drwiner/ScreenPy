He knocks away the SILENCED aimed at the back of his head with a sweeping block, capt Yusif's arm in an arm-lock.  The shot goes wide, shatteri urinal.

Harry drives Yusif's head into the counter.  T elbows him in the throat and they crash together on the f floor.  Harry grabs Yusif's hair and pounds his face repe against the rim of a urinal.
