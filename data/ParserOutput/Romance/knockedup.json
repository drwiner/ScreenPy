Maybe have her point it out to us on a globe? I don't understand the young talent in this town! It doesn't make any sense. I got four jobs. Hell, I'm more famous than half the people we talk to anyway! No one stands up. No one has the balls to sit them down and say, \"Look, just cut the shit.\"But everybody works for `em. They're all on the payroll. They're all sucking the teat! Nobody sits `em down, eye-to- eye, one-on-one, and says... \"Cut the shit.\" And all these stars just to fuck it up. That's what they do. They fuck my day up! And it pisses me off! And now I'm sweating."
