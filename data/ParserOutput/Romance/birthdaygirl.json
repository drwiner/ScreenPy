John listens intently and l around. \"Nadia...?\" -- John sits there, surrounded by his colleag listening to Nadia breathe. Close up on a man's hands tying a tie tight a-round a wom wrist. Pull back to a close up of Nadia's face, her eyes  fixed on John. John running by the river. John watches Nadia rise from his bed after sex and leave room. He stares out the window. Nadia's fingers, knitting skillfully. Nadia sits on her bed alone, pulling on black stockings a attaching them to suspenders. The street cricketers run for cover as a thunder storm br over the close. Rain coming down in John's garden. The pair sit under the shelter of the back porch. John has his hands out as Nadi is winding red wool it into a ball. The jumper is half  finished. The rabbits shelter from the rain under broad leaves. John in a pub with a four colleagues from the bank. He si his half, half listening to the conversation. It all seem so dull. He finishes his drink and looks at his watch. Th ask him if he's staying for another. A knitting needle is drawn from a row of red stitches on nearly-finished jumper. Nadia kneels over John holding the knitting needles. She  presses one to his skin and we watch it drawn across his  chest in close up, up to his neck. His eyes are fixed on hers. Close up on Nadia's face. Her mouth is gagged and she's l on her front, head half-buried in a pillow. We can just m out John behind, on top of her. Both are lying still and  breathing hard, covered in sweat. Catching her breath Nad yanks the gag off and wriggles out from underneath him.
