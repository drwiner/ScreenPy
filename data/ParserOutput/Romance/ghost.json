An old white plaster wall FILLS THE SCREEN. Momentary bli of light flash across it. SOUNDS of street traffic are he dimly in the distance. With startling impact, the SOUND of a sledgehammer explod out of nowhere. The wall shudders. HAMMER BLOWS assault the audience. They are loud and jarr The wall buckles. Chunks of plaster CRASH to the floor. The air fills with swirls of white dust. The SLEDGEHAMMER smashes INTO VIEW. Beams of sunlight cut through the cracks, piercing the  atmosphere like searchlights in a fog. A huge section of  wall falls toward camera as more plaster billows into the air. We hear voices talking."
