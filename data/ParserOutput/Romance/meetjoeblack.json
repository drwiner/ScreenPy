I started in this business because this is what I wanted to do.  I knew I wasn't going to write the Great American Novel, but I also knew there was more to life than buying something for a dollar and selling it for two.  I wanted to give the news to the world, and I wanted to give it unvarnished.  The more we all know about each other, the greater the chance we will survive. Sure, I want to make a profit, you can't exist without one but John Bontecou is all profit.  If we give him license to absorb Parrish Communications, and he has his eye on a few others after us, we'll be appointing him to the position he craves -- Gatekeeper.  In order to reach the world you will have to go through John Bontecou.  And not only will you have to pay him to do this, far more expensive, you'll have to agree with him.  Reporting the news is a privilege and a responsibility and it is not exploitable.  Parrish Communications has earned this priv- ilege, John Bontecou wants to buy it.  As your chairman, I urge you to agree this company is not for sale. A silence, everybody shifts, the Board is in shock, Drew trying to maintain his balance."

Strange territory for Joe, not to be 'in control' and exe ing his power, but his inventions and responses in lovema ing are so real that an emotional exchange between he and Susan builds.  Joe has found himself in an unexplored lan of feeling and passion, he loves what is happening and ye at the same time, is terrified by it.  He feels himself b lured by some power he has not only never been aware of, is deeply dangerous to partake of; he knows what he is do is putting who he is at great risk, yet he goes right on. The powerful contradiction is transmitted to Susan, and i the end there is the knowledge they have together made a journey, they both have been swept away in a stream of ev they have created; and they don't care about the conseque Spent, they lie in silence.
