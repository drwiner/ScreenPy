When Rocklin reaches Arly, he takes her one hand from beh her back, and slowly forcing it up sees what is obviously Clara's letter in her tightly clenched fist. He tries to  open her hand, and Arly, knowing she lacks the strength t prevent it, suddenly whips out a knife with her free hand But that quick, Rocklin grabs the knife hand, and without any apparent effort, wrenches it free of her grasp and to it across the room, where it lands on the bunk. Arly rela her grip on the letter meanwhile, and Rocklin gets it, an tears it very deliberately, letting the pieces fall at he feet. He turns his back on her now, going over to his hat on th floor. Arly is furious in her helplessness and humiliation. And  Rocklin's smug manner isn't helping any. He picks up his and, glancing at Arly, puts his finger once more through bullet holes."
