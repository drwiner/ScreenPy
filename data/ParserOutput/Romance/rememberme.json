Linda looks great. She's dressed festively but tastefully Next to her is her eleven year old DAUGHTER, ALICIA. She twirling about the platform, still jazzed from the birthd party they attended in The City. Alicia wears a black dress with a pink cardigan and has a handbag. We notice a CHARM BRACELET with four-leaf clover her right wrist. The mother and daughter wait alone at one end of the stat platform. TWO TEENAGE BOYS wait at the other end. They speak soft, SLURRED SPANISH to each other. Linda gives the boys a glance and evaluates. She watches as Alicia spits a wad of gum into her mom's open hand. The Boys approach. Linda tenses. At the last second the b make a hard left turn and disappear down the stairwell. I quiet again. Linda relaxes, smiles at her daughter. The F TRAIN is rounding the final bend into the station. Their focus is on this train. It's getting closer, louder And so they don't see, don't hear the Boys coming back up stairwell behind them. Not until the boys have the mother and daughter boxed in the one who can hardly grow a mustache is showing them hi gun. Linda puts her arm around her daughter. Alicia looks terrified. The train roars INTO THE STATION as Linda quickly hands o her purse, her watch. She hands over her engagement ring her wedding band. One of the boys yanks Alicia's little purse away from her The other boy fumbles the wedding band. The ring CLANGS t the ground and rolls to a stop a few feet away. We hear MEN'S VOICES echoing up the stairwell. Now the Boys are boxed in. And starting to panic."
