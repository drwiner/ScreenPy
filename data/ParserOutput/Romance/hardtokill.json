This time Storm has his own tool -- and takes his cue to intercept the one about to connect with his head. He again uses the power of the attacker's momentum and as soon as his cue goes down, so does Storm's, onto the back of Jones's skull with so much force we hear the NECK SNAP at the same time the cue splinters in half! Storm is left with the jagged tip of the skinny end. Dunne, knowing he'll never make it in time to the couch at the rear of the room, lunges at Storm with a butcher knife he seizes from a tray of cold cuts on a side table. Storm traps the knife, and quickly guides it into Dunne's midsection. With the other hand he  raises the sharpened end of the pool stick and slams it down Dunne's throat via the windpipe!"
