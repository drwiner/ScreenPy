The bride and groom appear: MARIANNE, in white lawn, and  COLONEL BRANDON in full uniform. Behind them come EDWARD his parson's garb and, on his arm, ELINOR as matron of ho CLOSE on them as they watch the party moving away. MARIAN and BRANDON make their way forwards, everyone throws thei flowers over them, whooping and singing. An open carriage decked with bridal wreaths comes to meet them, and BRANDO lifts MARIANNE in. His melancholy air is all but gone and radiates joyful life and vigour. MARIANNE also looks extr happy - but there is a gravity to her joy that makes her  seem much older. According to the custom of the time, BRANDON throws a lar handful of six pences into the crowd, and the VILLAGE CHI jump and dive for them.

As draw back further still, he slowly pulls the horse around and moves off in the opposite direction."
