His was a dynamic voice in a paralyzed body, a full life lived long after he should have been dead. He graduated from college, wrote and published articles and poems, and -- against all odds, by his own admission -- entered into the fully human experience of physical love. In this way, Mark lived from day to day to day, from breath to breath to breath, for 49 years. He loved, and he was loved and in his quiet voice, he spoke loud truths."
