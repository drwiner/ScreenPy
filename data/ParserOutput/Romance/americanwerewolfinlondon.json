The conversation is loud and there is often laughter.  But there is something unsavory about these people.  A look of leanness and poverty.  They seem inbred and somehow sullen.  We establish the types and the general level of noise in the room. The door opens revealing David and Jack.  There is dead silence and all are staring in a not friendly way at the two boys who are made uncomfortable by all the strange attention.  They give each other a \"what?\" look, then turn to the assembled populace."

On all fours he gives himself over to the excruciating hurt and slowly begins to change. The metamorphosis from man into beast is not an easy one.  As bone and muscle bend and reform themselves, the body suffers lacerating pain.  We can actually see David's flesh move, the rearranging tissue.  His mouth bleeds as fangs emerge.  His whole face distorts as his jaw extends, his skull literally changing shape before our eyes.  His hands gnarl and his fingers curl back as claws burst forward. The camera pans up to show the full moon outside through the window.  David's moans change slowly into low guttural growls.  We hear the four footfalls as the WOLF begins to walk.  As the camera pans back over the room, we see the front door pushed open and hear the Wolf padding off into the darkness."

Mass confusion as orders are shouted and the police pursue the Wolf. It runs down an alleyway into a cul de sac.  It stops in the darkness, blocked by a brick wall.  The Wolf whirls around, defiant, roaring.  The cops quickly barricade the entrance to the alley."
