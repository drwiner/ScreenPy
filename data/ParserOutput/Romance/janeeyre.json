She carries a shawl and has a small bag of belongings over her shoulder. She trips, falls to her knees; looks back. Expressive eye open features. She is desperate. We see the house she is running from; a Jacobean battlemented mansion. Her need to escape is so great that she crawls forward until she is able to raise herself to her feet. She runs. She reaches an antique stile by a brook. She lifts hersel on to it. She lands on the road. And runs. I/E. DAY. A ROADSIDE/COACH. The sun is higher in the sky. Jane exhausted, now running down a main road. Her spirts lift at the sight of an approaching coach. She flags it down. Jane empties her purse into the driver's hand. He looks a her money then suspiciously back at her. A terse nod indicates she can get in."

She undertakes a tremendous effort not to betray he emotional state. She doesn't sob, she doesn't howl - although her breathing threatens to. Slowly, unable to be the day, she closes her eyes. EXT. EVENING. WHITCROSS. Sunset. A whitewashed, stone pillar set up where four roa meet on a barren moor. The coach driver opens the door. With a curt nod he indicates that Jane must get out. She looks around, dismayed. In each direction there is op moorland for as far as the eye can see. The driver sets o at a good pace - glad to be rid of such a passenger. Jane puts her hand to her side for her bag of belongings. It i not there. She runs as fast as she can after the coach. It is recedi towards the horizon. She comes to a halt, objectless, los alone. She pulls her knitted shawl around her. She leaves the road and sets off across the moor, into th gathering dark. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 2. EXT. NIGHT. THE MOOR. Jane is on her knees by a strange overhanging rock. The night sky is awesome; the universe is all around her. She is trying to calm herself with a prayer. EXT. DAY. THE MOOR. Jane lies on a great rock, soaking up the heat of the sun She is like someone numb with pain. She watches a lizard crawl over the rock. She is mesmerised. EXT. TWILIGHT. THE MOOR. Jane squats in the heather and eats bilberries as the lig fades. She hungrily licks the juice from her hand. EXT. DAWN. THE MOOR. Jane is asleep in the heather, her shawl wrapped around her. A red-haired child in a white nightgown lies by her side, watching her. It is Helen Burns. Helen reaches out. She touches Jane's hand. Jane wakes. S sits up. She is alone. EXT. DAY. BY A RIVER. Jane is crouched on a rock watching the waters go by. The sky is overcast. The first big drops of rain land on the stones. Jane makes no movement. A raven lands on a rock nearby. Jane is suddenly filled with a wild rage. She picks up a stone and hurls it at th bird with a raw cry. The gesture exhausts her. She watche the bird wheel away, as the rain starts to pour. EXT. TWILIGHT. A FARM BY A WOOD. It is raining hard. Jane sees a small girl come out of th farm with some leftovers. She drops them into a pigpen."

The moors rise away above her to the horizon. Jane looks at the sun starting to set. The clouds are red and gold. She sees a small red-haired girl in a white nightgown walking barefoot on the moors ahead of her. The girl turn looks back at Jane. With her last strength, Jane follows. EXT. EVENING. THE MOOR. Dark clouds are banking up; the rain starts again. Jane i struggling through a marsh. Her boots are stuck. She falls. Her hand disappears into mud; her face pressed against the earth. She doesn't move. She has reached the point of despair. The girl's bare feet walk close by, as if waiting for her Jane looks up. Where the child should be, she sees a ligh shining across the moor. Jane starts crawling. EXT. NIGHT. THE MOOR/MOOR HOUSE. Jane is toiling on through the lashing rain towards the light. It has become a window. A brief flash of lightning shows her a low stone cottage. Helen Burns is sitting on the gate."

She comes to a pair of rusting iron gates hanging open between granite pillars. She walks through them. She finds herself in front of a decrepit Elizabethan mano house; no garden, just a sweeping semi circle of meadow grass, which someone has cut at with a scythe. Jane stops Standing on the threshold is Edward Fairfax Rochester. He is in his shirtsleeves. He stands strong, stalwart, brooding. His hair is still raven black. He is looking sightlessly around his domain, with the concentration of hawk. His strength is undiminished. He walks fifteen paces from the house. It brings him into the middle of the semicircle of grass. He is close enough for Jane to see his scarred eyes. She walks towards him, silent. A few drops of rain begin to fall. Rochester puts out his right hand to feel them. He raises his face up to the sky as if he is looking for something from there. He is absolutely still; his expression, serene. Jane is very close. She steps on a twig. It breaks with a loud crack, shattering the silence. Rochester is immediately on guard, his expression turning wary. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 118. He suddenly swipes the air with his left arm; the ruin of it passing an inch from her face. Jane steps back. Rochester swipes again. She holds her breath. He seems satisfied at last that nothing is there. He turn and walks fifteen paces back to the house. He disappears into the dark interior. Jane starts to breathe again. EXT. DAY. FERNDEAN - THE SIDE ENTRANCE. Jane lightly taps on the side door. Martha opens it; she astonished. Jane puts her finger over her lips. INT. EVENING. FERNDEAN - THE DRAWING ROOM. Rochester is in an armchair in front of his fire. Pilot i at his feet. Jane carries in a tray with a candelabra and jug of water."
