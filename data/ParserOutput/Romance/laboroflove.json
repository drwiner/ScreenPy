H relaxes a bit as he finally straightens his leg.  Maurice sits there motionless -- eyes glazed... defeated. The SOUNDS OF A BIRD snap him out of his trance.  He look to see a PAINTED BUNTING, a bird about six inches in heig FLY DOWN from a tree and land on a rock next to him.  Mau stares at the beautiful bird curiously.  Its body splashe with brilliant blues, reds and greens.  It looks out of p in these mundane surroundings.  Maurice looks around the skies to see no other birds.  The Painted Bunting chirps few times before taking flight into the air.  It circles Maurice before disappearing behind the trees. Maurice smiles.  He pulls himself to his feet with great effort. Maurice opens all of his bags and begins emptying the essentials -- the maps, food, a canister of water. Maurice reloads one bag and pulls it over his shoulder wi great effort.  At his feet, are the rest of his belonging piled on the side of the road. Maurice painfully begins walking again. WE PULL BACK on Maurice's figure walking on the highway.. the pile of disregarded things laying by the side... The highway is endless... winding it's way for miles and mile into a fixed dot in the distance."

My patient comes back -- goes nuts when she hears that Mac has been in the sewer for over 48 hours. Apparently the cop who found the dog didn't want to get his pants dirty.
