We get  up at 5 a.m., hump all day, camp around 4 or 5 p.m.,  dig foxhole, eat, then put out an all-night ambush or  a 3-man listening post in the jungle.  It's scary  cause nobody tells me how to do anything cause I'm  new and nobody cares about the new guys, they don't  even want to know your name.  The unwritten rule is a  new guy's life isn't worth as much cause he hasn't  put his time in yet - and they say if you're gonna  get killed in the Nam it's better to get it in the  first few weeks, the logic being: you don't suffer  that much.  I can believe that ... If you're lucky  you get to stay in the perimeter at night and then  you pull a 3-hour guard shift, so maybe you sleep 3-4  hours a night, but you don't really sleep ...

A huge Nazi flag on an antenna looms up in the bush, foll the great belly of a turreted dragon crunching down a tre its breakfast. A big tough GERMAN SHEPARD comes boudning at him sniffs, by a flak-jacketed MONSTER MAN - filthy and greasy, unsha face, earring in his left ear, 'DEATH CORPS' scrawled on shirtless flak jacket and a drawing of a death's head, he like a cross between a pirate and a hell's angel.  Behind SECOND MONSTER MAN and the ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER grin engine, a human skull hanging from its turret."
