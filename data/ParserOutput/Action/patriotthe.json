The house, built of native brick, is well-constructed and well-maintained.  There's a barn, a workshop and a forge. It is a home of substance rather than wealth.  On the front porch, MARGARET, 11, pumps a butter churn while her brother, WILLIAM, 6, watches. GABRIEL, 18, strong and handsome, walks out of the woods with a musket in his hand and a dozen game-birds over his shoulder.  At his side walks THOMAS, 14, also carrying a musket."

Racks of tools, planes, hammers, augers, drills, blocks, all hanging in their places.  All very well-worn. FRANCIS MARION methodically works his lathe, turning a piece of hardwood, shaving off tiny curls of wood with a razor-sharp chisel.  He's in his late-forties, strong and weathered.  His hands, though big and callused, handle th chisel with a surgeon's precision.  Self-educated and self-sufficient, he has built himself, as he built his farm, brick by brick, from the coarse clay of the earth. A finely-made rocking chair, missing only the dowel on which Marion is working, sits on the work table.  The chair is a work of art, thin and light, a spider-web of perfectly turned wood, no nails, no glue. Sitting on the woodpile, SUSAN, 4, a silent, stone-face wisp of a child, watches her father. Marion takes the piece of wood out of the lathe, carefull fits it into the chair, inserts a peg and taps it into place.  Then he steps back and appraises his handiwork. He picks up the chair and hooks the top rail to a scale, countering with a three-pound weight.  The chair floats. Marion blows softly on the weight which sinks.  Susan nods, so far, so good.  Marion puts the chair on the floo and walks slowly around it, checking every angle. Then, the acid test.  He takes a deep breath and lowers himself onto the seat, gingerly adding an ounce at a time Not a creak.  He smiles and sits back with a sigh. CRACK!  THE CHAIR SPLINTERS under Marion's weight, DUMPIN HIM on his ass on a pile of broken wood."

A REDCOAT draws a bead on Marion who drops to the ground an FIRES, killing him. Samuel, WEEPING as he loads, hands a primed musket to Nathan who FIRES... The Redcoats turn their attention to THE SPOT MARKED BY NATHAN'S SMOKE... Marion SEES THE REDCOATS AIMING TOWARD THE BOYS.  He instantly STRIDES OUT INTO THE OPEN, drawing the Redcoats attention from his sons... Marion FIRES BOTH HIS PISTOLS, killing two Redcoats... One Redcoat finishes reloading... Marion rushes him, shoves aside the barrel and SLAMS him in the face with th butt of the musket... This is a DIFFERENT MARION, a vicious, savage Marion, killing with stunning brutality... Marion drops his own expended rifle and CATCHES THE REDCOAT'S LOADED MUSKET before it hits the ground shoves that musket into another Redcoat's belly and FIRES... Two Redcoats left, neither finished loading... MARION CHARGES, drawing his TOMAHAWK, ignores a GLANCING BAYONET WOUND to the neck, HACKS a Redcoat open... Splattering himself with BLOOD... The final Redcoat, a cherubic-face young man, ducks into the woods... Marion tears after him... A FOOTRACE... the young Redcoat BLASTING THROUGH THE BRUSH... the older Marion, panting, losing ground... A CLEARING... the Redcoat is almost to the cover of the trees on the far side... MARION THROWS HIS TOMAHAWK which FLIES through the air an SINKS IN THE REDCOAT'S BACK... Marion runs to the wounded Redcoat, grabs his hair, yanks back his head and SLITS HIS THROAT...

Gabriel leads several men, riding along a dry path that snakes through the swamp.  They cross a narrow land bridg onto a wooded island, joining a dozen-and-a-half men, including Marion who kneels at a campfire. CLOSE SHOT:  Several of Thomas' brightly painted LEAD SOLDIERS MELT in a cast-iron pan.  The little men fall to their knees then lose form, turning into bubbling, molten metal. The new arrivals dismount and greet the others. Gabriel steps up behind Marion and watches as he pours th lead into a bullet mold, closes the lid and dips the mold into a bucket of water which HISSES and STEAMS."

Marion wavers... Then he takes a last look at Tarleton and heads off to help the faltering Patriots... TARLETON sees the movement of Marion and his men and sees Marion himself, his back exposed... AT THE PATRIOT LINE... Marion, Dalton and two dozen other militia cavalrymen arrive at the same time, beating back the Redcoats...

Marion is oblivious, concentrating on holding the America line...

Tarleton GRABS HIS SWORD, SLASHES AT MARION who dodges th blow... Tarleton advances... Marion scrambles back, then rises... Marion grabs a BROKEN CAVALRY LANCE and FENDS OFF REPEATE BLOWS from Tarleton's SWORD... Then Marion sees his pistol, loaded with a bullet from Thomas' lead soldiers, lying on the ground... Marion makes his way toward the weapon... still BLOCKING BLOWS from Tarleton's sword... Marion focuses on the pistol... leaving himself exposed.. Tarleton sees the OPENING... MOVES ON MARION... TARLETON RAISES HIS SWORD, about to deliver the killing blow... Marion dives... GRABS HIS PISTOL... FIRES... KILLING TARLETON WITH A SHOT TO THE CHEST... Marion, stunned, exhausted and surprised to be alive, watches Tarleton fall... Marion stands over Tarleton's body and gives himself a moment of bitter triumph, then he turns back to the battl at hand... Marion picks up Tarleton's sword and runs to the AMERICAN LINE which stiffens as Dalton and Rev. Oliver are joined by Marion and a dozen other Patriots... The blue-uniformed Continentals reform their line... Marion looks back toward Tarleton but finds that his body along with the place and the moment of his death, has disappeared into the smoke of the battle... Marion and his men fight on... then, Redcoats start fleeing the field... First one Redcoat at a time... then more and more..."

Then, a single figure appears on one of the British parapets.  A DRUMMER BOY, no more than ten-years-old. Behind him, a single British officer. They boy begins to beat the drum.  The officer raises a white flag. In the American lines, the men see the flag.  Some call out, some cheer, some laugh, most, among them MARION, simply take a deep breath.  It's finally over."

At the head of the avenue, WASHINGTON AND HIS STAFF stand waiting. A musical band of Continentals, thirty men strong, loudly plays a tune, \"The World Turned Upside Down,\" a jaunty British air with a melancholy undercurrent.

MARION, standing with Dalton, Rev. Oliver, Abner, Scott and the rest of his surviving men sees Cornwallis pass...
