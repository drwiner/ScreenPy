He scrambles into the street, around the and grabs the gun... Roper dives over the hood of the car and knocks Clarence  down before he can aim. They roll into the middle of the  street. Both have a death grip on the weapon. Clarence fi like a trapped animal. Thrashing desperately. Roper pins on his back, but can't pry the gun out of his fingers."
