There is the sound of EXPLOSIONS, distant, and an intermi electronic WHINE.  Incredibly bright searchlights play ov the ground.  PANNING with the moving treads through twist wreckage, F.G. The screen WHITES OUT with a BLAST, very close.  As the debris clatters down, a helmetted head snaps up into FRAM EXTREME F.G. The visor of the HIGH-TECH HELMET is shattered, presumabl by the explosion.  The wearer rips it off, revealing a younger Reese, minus his burn scar. His face is bathed in sweat, lit by the glow from a CRT SCOPE-SIGHT on a strange-looking rifle. The sound of SCREAMS and HOARSE SHOUTS not far off, and a continuous low murmuring of RADIO CHATTER, grid coordinat casualties, unit placements, medic requests. Reese looks over his shoulder at his teammate, a GIRL of about sixteen, gaunt, dirty, heavily armed like himsel DOLLYING as they start to belly crawl through the bones and wreckage. Reese looks up. Through spires of a collapsed building a terrifying SPHINX-LIKE SHAPE moves against the sky...obscured by dus and blinding sweeps of its searchlights. Though we see little, this is an H-K,Hunter-Killer mobile ground-unit. Reese crawls, pacing the H-K, under and through, on elbow and knees, past mounds of charred skulls.  They pass the BODY OF A CHILD, a boy of about 10, center- punched with a smoking hole.  The boy clutches a rifle. More bodies.  Some in rags, some in uniforms like theirs. WOMEN. OLD MEN. CHILDREN.  They're all dirty and gaunt, scabrous.  And still bleeding.  Reese scrabbles past a dark rat-hole and there are human rats in it.  Some of th are sobbing, or screaming. Another EXPLOSION. The GLARE lights the huddled few. Human vermin with mud-caked weapons that haven't been invented yet.  Soldiers in a nightmare war. Reese and his teammate stop behind a blasted wall, having outflanked the massive H-K.  Its flashing blue lights fli across the walls, its searchlights sear through the debris. WIDER, showing the H-K more clearly...a blast-scarred CHROME LEVIATHON, with hydraulic arms folded mantis-like against its 'torso', and huge underslung GUN TURRETS. Reese leaps up and straight-arms a satchel-charge into it path.  One tread rolls over the explosive. Guns and searchlights swivel.  The head turns ponderously Reese's partner rises, poised to throw hers. A POWER-BOLT catches her at the top of her arc, BLOWING HER INTO RED MIST. Reese is knocked down by the concussion.  Gets up, runnin as the charges blow. The H-K's tread carriers are RIPPED APART. It lurches to a stop, burning. The following SEQUENCE is extremely FORESHORTENED. CUT FAST.  IMPRESSIONS ONLY. Running. Explosions light the ruins like flashbulbs. ENERGY WEAPONS criss-cross the night like tracers. LOW ANGLE, up past the burning H-K as its flying counter- part, an AERIAL H-K, arcs into view with a TURBOJET WHINE Reese hauls two survivors of his unit into a PERSONNEL CARRIER, a CHEVY CAMARO with steel plate welded over it a the roof cut away to access the 50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN. It's stripped and rusted and bullet-riddled, glassless. The TIRES are OFF-ROAD and very gnarly. They're driving through the ruins, up and over and throug Reese drives like a demon.  Under other circumstances it would be considered insane.  Here it is merely very good. The machine gun CHATTERS. A BLACK SHAPE descends, a demon with searchlights. A BOLT OF LIGHT. Reese's car flips like a kicked beer can, rolling and crumpling.  He's pinned in the wreck, bloody, screaming despite his training.  The only other survivor, an emaciated BOY of twelve, is pulling for all he's worth to drag Reese out before it burns."

Her hair is singed by burning gunpowder.  An involuntary cry is punch out of her by the double concussions. Reese is stroking up another shell as Terminator half-ris from booth. OVER REESE'S SHOULDER, as he fires, cocks the slide, fire again, advancing on Sarah's booth. Terminator is blown backward over the center divider, crashing through the glasses and pitchers of beer on the table opposite, and onto the floor. Sarah is screaming, scrunched down in the booth. Terminator is lying on his back at the feet of a table- full of drunk patrons. He has two rifled 12 gauge slugs in his chest and one in the arm. The bar customers are frozen in the weird tableau, coweri gaping. Sarah stops screaming. Reese stand motionless, gun aimed. In the sudden silence, the sound of him cocking the shotg is abnormally loud. ON TERMINATOR, very still. Then he smoothly rolls to a crouch and slips the UZI mach pistol from beneath his overcoat, where it has been hang- ing on a shoulder strap. He doesn't seem too impaired as he swings around to fire. Reese rolls like a cat and comes up firing. A burst from the UZI rakes the bar where he stood. An orgy of shattering glass. Total pandemonium. SEVERAL ANGLES  as patrons of the bar run, scream or dive for cover, depending upon their level of intelligence. Reese slides through the glass to Sarah's booth and seize her wrists. ON TERMINATOR, kneeling amid the chaos, raising the UZI one-handed. Reese tugs viciously on Sarah's arm and she sprawls acros the booth seat a moment before the divider and seat cushi erupt with hits from the UZI. ANGLE ON A RUNNING PATRON as a burst of 9mm fire catches him in the chest.  He pitches into Sarah's booth, pinning her. Reese fires, ducks, fires again. Tables crash over. A window is blown out. A table candle rolls into a pool of high-proof alcohol behind the bar. It ignites with a WHOOSH. Reese feed two shells into the riot-gun. TIGHT ON TERMINATOR, an island of slow, precise movement amid the confusion.  He drops a spent clip.  Reaches for another with his bloody hand. MOVING WITH REESE as he vaults the row of booths and star firing.  At point blank range he unloads the shotgun into Terminator's belly."

MEDIUM ON TERMINATOR as he sits at a ratty folding table under the light. His eyebrows are singed off. Hair a charred stubble. Left eyes glistening with imbedded glass shards. Before him on the table is an array of SMALL TOOLS. He removes the charred remains of his jacket and props. one elbow on the table. ANGLE PAST HIS NON-FUNCTIONAL RIGHT ARM, F.G., as he exam ines it.  He picks up an X-ACTO KNIFE and cuts deeply int the skin of his forearm. His expression is one of mild concentration.

He walks along a row of CARS, models from the eighties an nineties, now stripped, rusty and modified to carry weapo There are conventional military vehicles as well. He passes several family groups. Gaunt kids are huddles around an old TV SET. Its glow bathes them. REVERSE ANGLE reveals that the set has been gutted and a small cookfire crackles inside the shell. Nearby a kid has a LARGE RAT cornered and is whacking it with a stick. Reese pauses at the end of the row of vehicles and unsnap a pocket in his tunic, removing a small paper rectangle, a worn photograph. C.U. - REESE, gazing down.  His head snaps around at the sudden sound of BARKING. ANGLE ON SENTRY POST as the dogs go crazy."
