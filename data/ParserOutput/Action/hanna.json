We see his p of view through his night vision sight, just the dark tun stretching on. Like a ghost HANNA'S face appears up close, her eyes a pe white. She slams the gun back in the HENCHMAN'S face. Still in night vision we see the fight, quick and hard. T flash of a single bullet illuminates his death. Silence once more. HANNA now has the first HENCHMAN'S rifle. From around the corner into the next tunnel she hears the sound of feet on dirt. She presses herself against the tunnel, waits listening, hears the feet again and in one movement raises the rifle and spins round the corner. Through her night vision sight she sees a deer, scared ey staring back at her. She releases her grip on the trigger and the deer scamper into the darkness."
