Her training kicking in, Rachel uses a krav magah move to grab and twist Vogel's forearm, breaking his hold on her and turning the arm until, with a yell of pain, Vogel dro the shard. He swings wildly at her, but Rachel ducks the fist and drives the palm of her hand up into his face. Vogel stumbles back, surprised by her speed and the sudde pain of the blow. Rachel is about to press home the attack but is blinded b blood from her wound washing into her eyes. As she wipes her eyes clear, Vogel grabs a LAMP from a small chest of drawers in the hall and smashes it into he face. She falls. Vogel begins to run, but, driven by adrenaline and desperation, Rachel scrambles onto all fours and lunges a him, catching hold of his trouser leg as he moves towards the front door. Vogel stumbles, manages to pull a leg free and stamps dow on Rachel who lets go with a moan. He stamps again, steps free and kicks her hard in the head. Rachel rolls with the force of the kick and comes to a rest, losing consciousness.

He may have begun his speech hoping to get a reaction fro David but he has lost himself in his rant and so rather than triumph we see only a moment of startled fear in his eyes as David suddenly swings the bowl violently at his head, SHATTERING IT on the pipe to which he is tied. He grabs Vogel by the collar and begins to punch him, har again and again. Vogel slides sideways, limp. And still David punches him a murderous rage, possessed, wanting to break his skull open, to kill him. Rachel and Stephan run in, with Rachel reaching him first She throws her arms around him, trying to stop him, but - instinctively - he throws a punch behind him. It connects splitting her lip and sending her flying to the ground. Stephan runs at him, knocking him to the floor, and remai lying on him, the two of them breathing hard, the assault finally over.
