CREDITS as we hear the haunting song float through dense forests.  We finally come to a rough, muddy road slashing through the forest.  On the road a GERMAN PEASANT FATHER is herding along three sickly looking cows.  His two SONS are with him.  His youngest son sits on one of the cows and sings a soft, plaintive song. They become aware of another sound behind them on the roa -- the creak of wood, the slap of metal on leather.  The Father immediately leads his cattle and his sons off the road.  They stand-still, eyes down:  the familiar posture of subjugated peoples throughout history. A wagon train rumbles past them.  Three ornate wagons followed by a mounted cohort of fifty heavily-armed PRAETORIAN GUARDS. The young boy dares to glance up at the passing Romans. His eyes burn with hatred."

He approache a large network of tents.  He enters."

Gangs of whores of both sexes trawl the streets.  They have bizarrely-colored hair and elaborate makeup... Citizens begin arriving, pushing past the vendors and the pickpockets.  We see whole families with picnic lunches.. Ferocious animals are brought into the Colosseum in barre cages... In the busy arcade, barbers and blood-letters practice their craft alongside exotic alchemists, fire eaters and contortionists... Richer citizens arrive in sedan chairs and chariots, they feign indifference to the hooting mob... Mounted City Guard police units try to retain some order...

Nothing we could have possibly imagined could have prepared us for the sight of the thousands and thousands of screaming spectators, the row after row of cheering faces. It is staggering. But for Maximus none of this exists.  His full attention is focused on one spot alone.  The Imperial Box. He can see Commodus and Lucilla sitting in the box.  The box is elevated fifteen feet above the arena floor at the top of a sheer black marble wall.  A cohort of fifty imposing Praetorian Guard Archers surround the box. Commodus' personal Body Guard of six Centurions actually stand in the box itself, eyes constantly watching like modern Secret Service agents. Commodus is untouchable. Meanwhile, three teams move from different entrances to the arena. As Cassius orates to the crowd:"

A chaos of dust -- and the battle is on -- The chariots zoom around the arena -- the archers keeping up a deadly hail of arrows. Maximus immediately dives onto a passing chariot and kill the charioteer and archer -- he dramatically leaps from the front of the chariot to a lead horse and cuts it free And Maximus takes control, we see the General of the Feli Regiment gloriously alive again as he barks out orders an leads his gladiators in battle.  They follow him faithfully, his stern commands unquestioned. His strategies are quick and smart, he makes the gladiators work together. This kind of slaughter could last for hours... We see flashes of the endless battle... Maximus races on his horse past another chariot, kills the driver, the chariot smashes into a wall... the sun sinks lower, the shadows on the sand lengthen... areas of the sand are swamps of blood, Juba slips, pulls himself up fighting... Maximus uses Vibius to create a diversion, two chariots collide... the crowd roars... a gladiator is dragged between a chariot and the side wall of the arena... the drummers pound out their relentless tattoo... Finally... Maximus is on his horse across from the final chariot. We can see that Juba and Vibius and a few other gladiator are still alive.  The rest of the arena is polluted with the dead and injured. Maximus spurs his horse and gallops toward the final chariot -- the charioteer whips his horses and zooms toward Maximus -- The crowd is breathless -- watching the final battle -- Maximus and the chariot speed toward each other -- like Medieval jousters -- And collide in a flashing explosion of steel -- Maximus sails from his horse -- as the charioteer sails from his chariot -- Maximus lands hard but quickly pulls himself up, he races to the final charioteer.  The charioteer is defeated but not dead. Maximus glances around, all his opponents are defeated. He stands over the final charioteer.  Then he simply tosses down his sword. The crowd is stunned by this strange act of mercy.  But then an enormous roar grows from the crowd -- wave after wave of adulation for the hero of the day. Maximus looks around, taking it all in. Then he turns to the Imperial Box. Maximus slowly walks to before the the Imperial Box.  The Praetorian Archers immediately raise their bows, pointing down at him. Maximus glares up at Commodus through his helmet mask. Commodus returns his gaze, curious. The crowd is intrigued, growing quiet.  What is going on? Then Maximus simply turns and begins walking away."

The crowd cheers and Maximus immediately turns and starts slashing -- Tiger easily blocks and strikes back -- The sword play is very fast -- they block and parry and hack like lightning -- constantly attacking -- they are perfectly matched -- As he fights Maximus becomes aware of a strange sound ove the roar of the crowd -- a low rumbling -- then he feels something -- a vibration in the ground -- Suddenly traps doors swing open and four enormous platforms rise into view.  On each platform is a snarling Bengal tiger restrained by a chain.  Tiger's teams of \"cornermen\" hold the chains through a pulley system.  The cornermen are safely inside cages.  The platforms stop at ground level. The four ferocious tigers now mark the four corners of th battleground. Tiger takes advantage of Maximus' momentary confusion and assaults brutally -- forcing him back toward one of the tigers -- the tiger claws for Maximus -- Maximus just evades it claws -- rolls for a new position -- another tiger snaps at him -- Tiger attacks -- Maximus is on the defensive -- fighting off Tiger and evading the four snarling beasts -- And then all four tigers are suddenly closer.  The teams of cornermen are letting the chains play out, bit by bit, gradually reducing the size of the battle ground.  The crowd roars. But the fight is hardly fair. Whenever Tiger is near one of the tigers the cornermen pull back the tiger slightly -- when Maximus is near a tiger they let it out a bit. Maximus and Tiger fight -- swirling action -- finally, Maximus has the edge -- he circles so that the sun stabs into Tiger's eyes -- then Maximus lunges forward under Tiger's swinging sword and SLAMS into him -- they fall -- a tiger swats at Maximus' face -- he jerks his head back -- he shoots out a leg and kicks Tiger's sword toward one of the tigers -- it is out of reach -- Maximus leaps up and stands over the winded Tiger, sword to his throat. Tiger is gasping for breath, crushed. Then one of Tiger's corners suddenly cheats -- they completely release a tiger -- it leaps for Maximus -- Maximus barely has time to turn -- the tiger crashes into him -- its claws slashing into his back, cutting through his leather armor -- Maximus shoves an armored forearm into the tiger's jaws and stabs with his sword -- Tiger takes this chance to pull himself up -- one of his corners throws him another sword -- the crowd boos -- Maximus wrestles with the tiger -- spinning it around wit superhuman effort so it is always between himself and Tiger -- so that Tiger can't get at him -- Maximus finally kills the tiger and leaps for Tiger -- he quickly disarms him and tosses him to the ground -- Maximus stands over him -- ready to administer the coup d grace. All eyes turn to the Emperor. Commodus slowly stands and steps to the edge of the Imperial Box.  He raises his arm and gives the fatal thumbs down. Maximus looks up at him. And then defiantly tosses the sword to the ground, refusing to kill Tiger. Commodus is stunned. The crowd gasps -- a collective intake of breath -- and then an enormous roar building.  It cascades around the Colosseum.  It is a roaring celebration of the unexpected act of mercy.  And the delicious act of defiance of the Emperor. Commodus slowly sits. Maximus walks across the arena -- the people stand and cheer for him.  Cries of \"Maximus the Merciful\" can be heard. It is the birth of a hero."
