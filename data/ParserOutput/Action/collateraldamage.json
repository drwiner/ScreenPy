Two Colombian officials and an American military officer died in last Thursday's blast. Also killed were Anne Pitt, wife of a New York City firefighter, and their only child, four-year-old Matt... The President has vowed that the United States will avenge what he called 'this monstrous act of barbarism and cowardice'... Intelligence sources say the identity and whereabouts of The Wolf remain a mystery. They believe he has worked closely with radical elements in Latin America for more than twenty years and have linked him to numerous terrorist bombings, including the 1983 downing of a Peruvian airliner, which killed forty-two people, eleven of them Americans...

Gordy drives him backward. Slams him against a wall. Then hooks an arm around the back of The Wolf's neck and drives the other fist like a piston into his abdomen. All his weight behind the punches. Trying to break ribs and crush them into The Wolf's heart, when... A bodyguard slams the butt of an AK into Gordy's kidneys. Gordy takes the blow standing. The guard delivers a second, much harder shot, and Gordy drops to his knees in agony. Beat. The Wolf recovers from the hammer-blows to his midsection. And then... He makes Gordy pay for the punches. Lands blow after blow on Gordy's face. Beats the living shit out of him... and leaves him unconscious on the dirt floor."

She falls hard. Gets back to her feet quickly and starts to run, when... Gordy hits her like a linebacker. Slams Selena against a brick wall. Gets behind her and slips a mighty arm around her thin neck. Selena squirms hard, kicks backward, going for the balls, kneecaps, insteps, doing whatever she can to hurt Gordy and get free. But she's not in a position to do a lot of damage -- and she'd have to kill him before he'd let go. Gordy's got his arm locked in a police chokehold around Selena's neck. Uses his weight to force the smaller woman down onto her knees. Presses her harder, till she's sitting back on her legs. Selena can't drop out of the hold, and her legs are immobilized. All she can do is scratch. But Gordy's oblivious. They're alone in the courtyard. Body to body. Head to head. He's pumped with fury and hatred. He tightens the chokehold. Hisses in her ear --"
