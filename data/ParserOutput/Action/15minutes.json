Why are we showing something so journalist, I must show it.  A democracy survives through the freedom of its media, and if we cannot see what is happening then we don't deserve our democracy, or our freedom.  Eddie Flemming was my friend.  I cried when I watched this footage and vowed to fight this violence with every molecule of my being from this day onward.  Hopefully, this will have a similar effect on you.
