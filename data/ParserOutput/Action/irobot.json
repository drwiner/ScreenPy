Another LINE o ROBOTS. Descending between Spooner and Calvin. Cutting th off from one another... Spooner. Catching glimpses of Calvin. On the other side o the metal bodies. Trying. To cut through. His heart. Starting to POUND. As Calvin. Disappears... He swivels round. But another line of ROBOTS. Drops down. Cutting him off. He stumbles back. As another line. Appears before him... Breathing. Getting heavier. He looks down at his hand. It's trembling. NOISE CRASHING, all around him. Everywher he turns. More ROBOTS...BLANK EYES...GAPING MOUTHS... He darts through the line. Finds a wall. Leaning against it, pulls a small BOTTLE from his pocket. Rips off the li Shakes out a couple PILLS. Swallows them. Staring down. A his trembling hand. Squeezing his eyes. Open and shut... WHEN SUDDENLY. A passing ROBOT. Grabs him by the collar. SMASHING him against the wall. It's the Suspect. Spooner. Sinks to the ground. As the Suspect Robot. Slips off the line. STANDING. Over him. Raising his arms. Could end it. Right now. But looks. Into Spooner's eyes... Then turns.   Disappearing. Spooner. Stunned for a second. Then. Rallies. Scrambles to his feet and plunges back into the maze of bodies. Hea a POUNDING. In the distance. Catches a glimpse. Of the Robot. Trying to SMASH through a large SECURITY DOOR. Wit his metal fists... Spooner's view. Blocked once again.   By a shifting row. When a HAND. Lands on his shoulder.   He wheels round."
