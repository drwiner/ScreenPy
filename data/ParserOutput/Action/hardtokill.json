There is a LOUD CRACK and   scream as he lands on his hea and neck, and then -- from   the side, point-blank --anot ferocious SHOTGUN BLAST --   Storm is blown into the air and back onto the bed from   which he came."

This time Storm has his own tool -- and takes his cue to intercept the one about to connect with his head.

Storm is left with the jagged tip of the skinny end. Dunne, knowing he'll never make it in time to the couch at the rear of the room, lunges at Storm with a butcher knife he seizes from a tray of cold cuts on a side table.
