You and Mallory may be killers, but you're not insane. You belong in a prison, not in an asylum. The prison board is blatantly railroading you into a hospital for the sole purpose of turning you into vegetables. Now some people are saying, 'So what?' I am not one of those people. If we avert our eyes while they do this to you, we give them permission to do it again whenever they see fit. Today they wipe clean your mind because they feel your actions are dangerous, tomorrow they wipe clean my mind because they feel what I say is dangerous. Where does it all stop?"

And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing.

In a world where people can't seem to make the simplest relationships work and the slightest emotional commitment is considered devastating, Mick and Mallory have a do-or-die romance of a Shakespearean magnitude. To the country's youth, 75 percent of which are coming from broken homes, that's appealing. They have an 'us against the world' posture which always appeals to youth. And they've taken that posture seventeen steps beyond. It's not 'us against the world,' it's 'we're gonna kill the world.' They're exciting. I read their file and I find myself turning the page like it was a paperback. Why do disillusioned youths get into Mickey and Mallory? Why do disillusioned housewives read romance novels? Why are you filming this special? Because you know as well as I do, you say 'tonight at nine Charles Manson speaks,' everybody's going to tune in to hear what he says. Mickey and Mallory have shocked a country numb with violence. They've created a world where only two exist and anybody who inadvertently enters that world is murdered."

That's why we don't just input all the facts into a computer for the appropriate punishment. I couldn't give them the death penalty. See, California hops back and forth on that issue. Mickey and Mallory went to court when it was out of favor, which is actually good because it leaves more room for imagination. Anybody can give somebody the chair. When you have someone who deserves to die and you can't kill them, you have to be creative. And if the bastards had let it stand, it would of been the perfect sentence. It hit 'em right where they lived. Far more punishing than the death sentence."

Well, Mickey and Mallory were that 'kill 'em to watch their expression change' attitude personified. Except with each other. And, since they lived only for each other, I wanted to attack that, at its very root. So, in a nutshell, my sentence was double life for each without any possibility for parole. That would be fairly standard in their case. The twist I added was that the husband and wife would have no contact or correspondence with each other for the rest of their lives. And they would never receive any word or information about the other. So, basically once the cell door slams shut, Mickey and Mallory will completely disappear from each other's life. They'll never know when the other dies. But alas, the best laid plans of mice and men..."

He was really nice. Anyway, Warren showed me all these different models of guns. Magnums, automatics, pistols, Walters. And I ask to see a shotgun. He brings me a Mossberg pump action shotgun. As soon as I held that baby in my hands, I knew what I was gonna do. It felt so good. It felt like it was a part of me. They had a mirror in the store. I looked at myself holding it, and looked so fuckin' good, I immediately bought it. Bought a bunch of boxes of ammo. Turned my car around, drove to Mallory's house, we took care of Mallory's parents, packed up the car, and we were off."
