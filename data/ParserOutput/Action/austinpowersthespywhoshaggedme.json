He was  lactose-intolerant. He could eat red  meat all night long, but one sip of  milk and it was gastric hell. And I  remember we were caught in fragrance  delicto by Henry Kissinger, and you  can imagine my humiliation at having  Hank hear me say, \"Mr. French, no  teeth.\" One of my greatest  disappointments is that I never became  a song and dance man. I could have  been a quadruple threat, kind of  like a despotic Ken Barry. Dancer,  singer, actor, and I would possess  nuclear weapons, the latter being  the most threatening of the four. I  once sat on a bus and tried to will  myself a menstrual cycle. All I ended  up with was a sense of failure and a  mild neuralgia in my incisor teeth  and perhaps a grudging respect for  the weaker sex. I love toe cleavage.  For the most part I distrust dogs. I  slept in a horse once. It was quite  roomy. On second thought, it was the  Ritz. I named my left testicle 'piss'  and my right testicle 'vinegar'. I  wrote \"It's Raining Men\", or so the  Christmas babies told me. Oh yes, I  also made a Marzipan voodoo effigy  of The Fonze while I was in coma  after smoking some Peruvian prayer  hash, but who at the end of the day  can honestly say they haven't done  that?"
