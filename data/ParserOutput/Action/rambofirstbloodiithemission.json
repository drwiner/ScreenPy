Smoking a cigarette he looks around, perhaps scanning for the source of the faint crashing he heard a moment before Following a dirt road, little more than a trail between the hootches, an OLD WOMAN approaches.  She is barefoot, and pushes a rusting bicycle laden with an enormous bundl of firewood. Brewer struggles to free himself, straining in silence as the pigs step disdainfully around him. The man flicks away the cigarette.  He laughs raucously a something the old woman says and hurries to help her carr the firewood inside. Brewer looks up, at his chute billowing quietly in the branches overhead. The old woman pauses at the door, spits a shot of betelnu juice into the yard, and goes inside. The door bangs shut."

Rambo desperately catches the handles of the door gun, stopping his plunge into space.  His weight swings the gu around in its sling, pointing it into the ship. Completely outside the helicopter, Rambo hangs from the handle with one hand.  Pulls the bolt with the other. And drills a long burst into Palyushin at point blank range, blasting him out the far door in an explosive spra of blood. The pilot turns, terrified, as Rambo advances on him.
