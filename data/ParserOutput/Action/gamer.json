CLICK. It's DEAD. The GEEKS hav taken care of that. KABLE tosses it aside and sprints for CASTLE, but the SLA break off from the choreography to ENGAGE HIM; turns out they're flesh and blood after all. CASTLE backs away, whistling the melody, and continues hi SOFTSHOE to the music as KABLE wades into brutal hand-to- combat... breaking necks, snapping arms, smashing faces.. it's a full-on BALLET OF DEATH... finally, THE MUSIC ENDS right on cue: KABLE is finishing off the last of the men, blood on his hands."
