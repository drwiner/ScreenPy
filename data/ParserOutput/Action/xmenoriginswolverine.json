Before we hear anything the boy turns, watching the bend the road behind him. After a moment we hear the thrum of hard-charging engine. An Oldsmobile Super 88 rounds the bend, accelerating as i hits the straightaway. The boy steps away from the road b the car comes straight at him. The boy closes his eyes. The Oldsmobile's brakes clamp do on the wheels and the car shivers to a halt with inches t spare. Laughter spills from the car's open windows.
