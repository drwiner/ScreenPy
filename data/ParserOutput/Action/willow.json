The minion looks up in horror as the heavy keg crushes him. But the danger is far from over.  The wagon rocks along with one wheel half-destroyed.  Willow whips the reins and looks over his shoulder.  Steam-rolling toward them is the war chariot! The Nockmaar CHARIOT DRIVER stands up and stuffs the reins in his mouth.  He rasise his arm and begins to twirl a deadly weapon, a kind of bolo-blade, over his head. Madmartigan defends himself with a wooden wagon-post. The chariot driver hurls the whistling blade:  CHONK! It lodges in the post.  Madmartigan tugs.  So does the chariot driver.  Back and forth, the wagons smashing up each other.
