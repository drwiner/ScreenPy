The small hatch against which he was leaning is ripped away and SOMETHING snatches him out the opening  He disappears to the waist with a shriek, legs kicking.  The alien clings to the roof, pulling him out.  Its tail whips over, scorpionlike, and buries a four inch stinger in Gorman's shoulder. Hicks grabs a joy stick at the FIRE-CONTROL CONSOLE and turns it rapidly.  On the roof the alien looks up as servo-motors whir.  A remote control turret cannon, a 20mm chain-gun, swivels toward it in a curt arc. VOOM.  The creature is blasted off the vehicle's armored back and tumbles away.  Gorman, slumped unconscious, is dragged back inside. The APC rips away a section of catwalk and heads for clear air, its flank trailing fire like a comet. Ripley fights the controls as the big machine slews, broadsiding a control-room out-building.  Office furniture and splintered wall sections are strewn in the APC's wake. Suddenly, an alien arm arcs down, right in front of Ripley's face.  It smashes the windshield.  Glistening, hideous jaws lunge inside... Ripley recoils.  Face to face once again with the same mind-numbing horror.  She reacts instinctively.  Slams both sets of brakes with all her strength.  The huge wheels lock.  The creature flips off, landing in the headlights.  Ripley hits full throttle.  The APC roars forward, smashing over the abomination.  Its skeletal body is crushed under the massive wheels.  It rolls, tumbling...lost in the darkness behind as the machine thunders onto the causeway and away from the station. A sound like bolts dropped in a meat grinder is coming from the APC's rear end.  Hicks eases Ripley's hand back on the throttle lever.  Her grip is white knuckled."

Ripley lays the rifle on top of the cot and crawls carefully underneath.  Without waking the little girl, she slips her arms around her. Ripley becomes merely the larger of two children huddling together in the darkness under their bed. Newt's face contorts with the externalization of some tormented dreamscape.

The SQUEAL OF METAL as the legs scrape across the floor is jarringly loud in the stillness. When the space is wide enough she cautiously slides herself up between the wall and the edge of the cot, reaching for the rifle she left lying on top of the mattress.  Here yes clear the edge of the bed.  The rifle is GONE. She snaps her head around.  A SCUTTLING SHAPE LEAPS TOWARD HER from the foot of the bed!  She ducks with a startled cry.  The obscene thing hits the wall above her, legs moving lightning fast.  Reflexively she slams the bed against the wall, pinning the creature inches above her face.  Its legs and tail writhe with incredible ferocity and it emits a demented, piercing SQUEAL. Ripley heaves Newt across the polished floor and in a frenzied scramble rolls from beneath the cot.  She flips it over, trapping the creature underneath. They back away, gasping.  Ripley's eyes flash around the shadowed room where every corner of space between equipment holds lethal promise.  The creature scuttles from beneath the bed and disappears under a back of cabinets in a blur.  Ripley hugs Newt close and heads toward the door, moving as if every object in the room had a million volts running through it.  She reaches the door.  Hits the wall switch.  Nothing happens.  Disabled from outside.  She tries the lights. Nothing.  She pounds on the door.  The acoustically dampened door panel thunks dully.  She moves to the observation window, glancing frantically over her shoulder.  The bare floor behind her is like a screaming threat."

She looks into its tangle of arms and cables, inches away. Looks away.  Her eyes snap back.  SOMETHING LEAPS AT HER FACE.  She SCREAMS and topples off the table, splashing to the floor.  Newt shrieks and scrambles away as Ripley hurls the CHITTERING creature off of her.  It slams against a wall of cabinets, clings for a moment, then leaps back as if driven by a steel spring.  Ripley scrambles desperately, pulling equipment over on top of herself, clawing across the floor in a frenzy of motion.  In a blurr of multijointed legs the creature scuttles up her body. She tears at it, but it is incredibly powerful for its size.  It moves like lightning toward her head, avoiding her fumbling hands.  Newt screams abjectly, backing away, until she is pressed up against a desk in one corner. Ripley has both hands up, forcing the pulsing body back from her face.  The thing's tail whips around her throat and begins to tighten, forcing the underside of its body close to her.  Ripley thrashes about, knocking over equipment, sending instruments CLATTERING. Water streams over her, into her eyes, blinding her and making it impossible to get a grip on the creature's body. ANGLE ON NEWT  as crablike legs appear from behind the desk, right behind her.  She sees it and, thinking fast, jams the desk against the wall, pinning the writhing thing.  The desk jumps and shudders against all the pressure her tiny body can bring to bear on it. She wails between gritted teeth as the second creature gets one leg free, then another and another.  Squeezing itself inexorably onto the desk top...toward her. The legs of the chittering thing claw at Ripley's head, getting a surer grip even as she whips her head from side to side.  The obscene TUBULE extrudes wetly from the sheath on the creature's underside, forcing itself between the arms she has crossed tightly over her face. A figure appears at the observation window, a silhouette behind the misted-over glass.  A hand wipes a clear spot. Hick's eyes appear.  He steps back.  WHAM!  A burst of pulse-rifle fire shatters the tempered glass.  Hicks dives into the crazed spider web pattern and explodes into the room in a shower of fragments.  He hits rolling, his armor grinding through the shards, and slides across to Ripley.  He gets his fingers around the thrashing legs of the vicious beast and pulls.  Between the two of them they force is away from her face, though Ripley is losing strength as the tail tightens sickeningly around her throat.  Hudson leaps into the room, flings Newt away from the desk to go skidding across the wet floor, and blasts the second creature against the wall.  Point-blank.  Acid and smoke. Gorman appears at Ripley's side and grabs the tail, unwinding its writhing length like a boa constrictor coil from her throat.  All of them grip the struggling, SHRIEKING creature."

Bishop comes aft from the pilot's compartment to help Hicks dress his injuries.  Hicks is sprawled in a flight seat, the contents of a FIELD MEDICAL KEY strewn around him.  He's out of the game...contorted with pain."

Her hair is matted, and she glistens with sweat.  Her eyes burn with a determination that holds the gut-panic in check. The elevator descends.  She checks her weapon.  Attaches a BANDOLIER OF GRENADES to her harness.  Primes the flamethrower.  Checks the rifle's magazine.  Racks the bolt, chambering the first round.  She checks the MARKING FLARES jammed in the thigh pockets of her jump pants.  She drops an unprimed grenade, trembling, forcing herself to be strong.  We SEE she doesn't know doodley about grenades. This is the most terrifying thing she has ever done.  She begins to hyperventilate, soaking with sweat.  Her finger slick and slippery on the rifle.  The elevator descends. The lift motors whine, slowing.  It hits bottom with a bump.  The safety cage retracts.  Slowly, expectantly, the doors open. HER P.O.V.  THROUGH the parting doors...an empty corridor.  Dark, swirling with steam, a ruddy glow VISIBLE here and there.  It seems to have been a descent into Dantean Hell.  The air itself vibrates with heat distortion.  Couplings groan.

Ripley retreats, ducking under a glistening cylindrical mass.  A PIERCING SHRIEK fill the chamber.  She turns.  And there it is. A massive silhouette in the mist, the ALIEN QUEEN glowers over her eggs like a great, glistening black insect-Buddha.  What's bigger and meaner than the Alien?  His momma.  Her fanged head is an unimaginable horror.  Her six limbs, the four arms and two powerful legs, are folded grotesquely over her distended abdomen.  The egg-filled abdomen swells and swells into a great pulsing tubular sac, suspended from a lattice of pipes and conduits by a weblike membrane as if some vast coil of intestine were draped carelessly among the machinery.  Ripley realizes she ducked under part of it a moment before.  Inside the abdominal sac can be SEEN the forms of countless eggs, churning their way toward the pulsating ovipositor where they emerge glistening, to be picked up by DRONES.  The drones are tiny scuttling albino versions of the \"warrior\" aliens we have already seen. Ripley pumps the slide on her grenade launcher.  She fires.  Pumps and fires again.  Four times.  The grenades punch deep into the egg sac and EXPLODE, ripping it open from within.  Eggs are tons of gelatinous matter pour across the chamber floor.  The Queen goes berserk, SCREECHING like some psychotic steam whistle. Ripley lays about her with the flamethrower, igniting everything in sight with an insane fury.  Eggs shrivel in the inferno, and figures of warriors and drones vanish in frenzied thrashing.  Over all is the Queen's shrieking as she struggles in the flames.  Two warriors emerge from the boiling smoke, closing on her.  She pulls the trigger...an empty click.  DIGITAL COUNTER flashing crimson zeroes.  She drops the magazine, grabs another from her belt, rams it home and OPENS UP. The creatures vanish in rapid-fire flashes.  Ripley backs away, venting her terror in a sustained orgy of fire as she blasts everything that moves in one long eye-searing expenditure of energy.  Then she dashes into the catacombs, navigating by sheer primal instinct."

She slams the control for the other cage and hears the sound of the LIFT MOTOR'S WHINE as it begins its slow descent from several levels up.  AN ENRAGED SCREECH ECHOES in the corridor.  Ripley sees a silhouette moving in the smoke...a glistening black shape which FILLS THE CORRIDOR TO THE CEILING...THE QUEEN.  Her last cartridge is reading zeroes.  The flamethrower sputters uselessly when she tries that. The grenades are gone.  Ripley drops the weapon and looks up the shaft to the descending lift...then at the approaching FIGURE.
