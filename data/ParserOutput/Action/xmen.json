Then we see the eyes themselves that look up at them. A LITTLE BOY.  A boy who will not die this day.  A boy who will live to see the end of the war and the world of the future. He stares at the metal wire with an unusual fascination. The boy looks up at HIS WORRIED PARENTS - a sturdy- looking couple who try to smile and comfort him. The corridor comes to a junction where it splits in several different directions. Soldiers here push the mob using rifles as pikes, screaming and terrorizing the lot of them.  Suddenly it is clear what they are doing.  They are dividing the mob into smaller groups. Soon, the groups themselves become evident. Men from women.  Children from adults. The family tries to stay together, clinging to one another dearly, until finally, they are put upon by a number of gray uniforms and pulled apart. The boy is dragged screaming his feet no longer touching the ground. Two soldiers carry him as they follow the back of a large column of children being led through a gate of barbed wire so dense, it resembles wool. The gate closes and the boy looks back to see his parents - along with many others - being restrained by a number of soldiers.  The screaming is deafening. And the boy's can be heard above it all.  The soldiers seem to be having a hard time carrying such a frail child.  The farther they get from the fence, the heavier he seems to get, until they are literally pulling him as though he were anchored to something. His outstretched fingers claw at the thin air and he screams until the blood in his face is blue. The soldiers are literally pulled back a step and they begin to slip in the mud. They look at one another and then over their shoulders as they hear a sound. A groaning, creaking sound.  And then the unmistakable twang of wire stretched to snapping."

Every child holds a long reed-like stick and they chase each other playing their version of tag. As each child is tapped, they chase the others.  Each trying to avoid being \"it\", though never going far enough away to miss the fun. One girl in particular.  A PRETTY GIRL OF 12, with unusual white hair, is tagged and immediately shunned. She chases kids this way and that, but to no avail.  She is not strong enough, nor agile enough, to win. She tumbles and lands on her stick, snapping it.  She stands and, when the children see that her stick is broken, they begin to giggle. The giggles become laughter and the laughter becomes a taunt, and before we even realize, the inherent cruelty of children let loose becomes evident. They have now formed a circle, at first avoiding her touch with distance, but now growing tighter with menace. In the unspoken manner of children at prey, the group begins to chant in their native tongue - a song we have not heard but sung in a way none-too inviting.  They begin to poke at her with the reeds, driving her back. The girl now moves to the center of the circle, no longer wishing to tag anyone. ONE DEVIOUS CHILD seems to get an idea.  He takes his stick and smacks it across her shoulder.  She turns to face the child and another swings his stick across her back with a solid THWACK.  Before long, mob rule gives way and all the kids are swinging at her and laughing. It grows to the brink of frenzy, the laughing and the shouting not too unlike the noise of the previous scene. So much so, we may miss the first flake of snow.  The children certainly do.  It is snowing for a good ten seconds before the last of them stops. By then, the snow is thick as flies and wafting down to melt instantly on the hot African soil that has never seen snow before."

AN OLD MAN looks down at his feet and sees a tiny, misshapen ball of ice, no bigger than his eye.  He looks at it, bites it, then pops it in his mouth - breath turning to steam. Another such chunk of ice pops him on the head.  THE CROWD LAUGHS. They look up again and see that mixed with the snow are tiny pellets of hail, seeming to increase in number as the snow mysteriously wanes. And the pellets are getting larger.  Until they land as hunks. The white haired girl drops to the ground and covers her head as hailstones the size of baseballs plow into the Earth. Before long, tents are collapsing and panic ensues. And all along the white haired girl sits huddled in the dust, crying. As hailstones fall in a circle around her, never coming closer than then a few feet or so."

Before long, she transforms back into a healthy young girl with no sign of injury. Then, her escaping breath begins to accelerate, much in the way Loganis did - too much like Loganis did.  It is as if she has taken in his trait of berserker rage.  Soon she is smashing things all around her.  One hand rakes the wallpaper like claws. Finally, she gets a hold of herself, becoming the introverted Rogue we all know so well. Then she stands slowly, looks at the others. And she runs from the room.  Storm runs after her. The rest turn to Logan, who lays on the floor, convulsing. Jean goes to help him.  She looks back at Cyclops.  His expression makes it clear that his worst fears about Logan have come to pass."

Logan sits up in his bed, his chest bandaged. VRRRIP -- the sound of blinds being pulled open.  Bright sunshine fills the room, washing across a box and a card sitting on a bureau. ANGLE ON: the card as Logan reads it. LOGAN -- WELCOME HOME.  It is signed simply, X. Logan reaches in the box, pulling out -- a UNIFORM.  He lays it on the bed.  He pulls on one of the gloves, stretching his fingers in it.  Perfect fit. SHOOK -- He pops his claws through THREE METAL RINGLETS on the back of the glove -- clearly it was made specifically for him. Logan looks down into the box for him. INT. LOGANiS ROOM - LATER - DAY From behind Logan we see him finish putting something on over his head.  Logan turns into frame, he is wearing a dark blue MASK. It fits his head neatly.  The sides arch up shadowing his ears, giving him a wolf or fox-like appearance.  The shape is reminiscent of Loganis sketch -- the wolverine. Logan stands facing a mirror.
