We glimpse POV SHOTS of-- driving-- drinking in a bar-- intimate conversations-- watching an old movie-- a sex partner's face. The FIGURES before the screens are WATCHER DRONES, specialized surrogates-- a head and shoulders mounted on a wheeled contraption attached to tracks. This enables them to move and stop at any monitor quickly, surveilling dozens of surrogates. Males and females, but all have the same faces. PETERS stares in wonder at this voyeur's paradise. GREER grabs her arm to keep her from getting hit as a WATCHER tracks past. The Watcher ignores them, intent on work. They mount stairs into the RAISED HUB that overlooks the work floor. An extremely corpulent human being-- BOBBY SANDERS-- sits on a reinforced rolling chair, which he keeps in almost constant motion, eying the DOZEN SCREENS up here at once. ON SCREENS - POVs of actual criminal activity-- frantic running across a park-- a burglary in a darkened jewelry store-- packets of drugs changing hands.

He swings his body to get the momentum going the right way-- --but his grip gives a moment too soon-- GREER plunges from the roof to the BALCONY RAIL, hitting the railing hard, starting to fall off the wrong way.
