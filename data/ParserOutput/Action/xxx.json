Shooting in and out of that powdery mass like a surfer, t can see Xander skipping like a stone down the mountain fa There's a mad scramble as Guards turn their snowmobiles a ride for their lives. A furious Viktor spins around and m a run for it as well. Nobody has a chance. The avalanche is coming like a freig train, frothing like white water. Xander blazes right through the scrambling Guards and hit JUMP. He goes soaring up and lands square on the sloped r of the Outpost. The avalanche is right behind him, slamming down everythi and everyone in its way. Guards are swallowed up and tossed, snowmobiles go tumbli under the onslaught. Xander grabs onto the chimney as the avalanche washes ove the Outpost. He holds on until the ocean of snow comes to stop. Then it's all quiet. Above him the slope is a battlefield of icy rubble. There nothing moving up there anymore. Xander pulls himself fre Then he hears a gushing sound and a DEEP BENEATH THE SURF he sees the WARM ORANGE GLOW OF FLAME. It's Viktor and hi flame thrower. There's another SPURT and the glow fades f good. Xander boards to a rock and sits to catch his breath. He' right above the Castle now. Then his communicator starts BEEP."
