He opens the door on '3' and is about to run when he sees a security camera directly above. Grabbing a fire extinguisher, he pulls the pin. Spray coats the lens. Then he yanks a FIRE ALARM. A HORN BLARES DEAN runs for the second stairwell when he sees JONES stepping out. DEAN looks back at the stairwell he left. That door's opening as well. Trapped. Using the extinguisher, DEAN smashes the glass door to an office and goes inside. JONES starts to enter when a shot rips into the wall, convincing him otherwise. He retreats as the BLARING FIRE ALARM STOPS. DEAN races through the suite of offices trying locked door after locked door. Finally, one opens and he rushes in and tries to lock it behind himself. No lock. He sees the MEN and they see him. He slides a desk against the door, then backs away, pistol ready."

DEAN shimmies out through a broken side window. He barely gets to his feet as he stumbles 20 yards or so. His foot accidentally dislodges a large pile of coal, which buries him up to his waist and immobilizes him."
