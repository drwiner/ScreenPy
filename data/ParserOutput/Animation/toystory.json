Woody looks across the room to see Buzz combing Troll Dol hair, chatting away like a hair dresser. Woody angrily shakes Etch, removing Buzz's image. G) Rocky, Snake, Troll Doll and Rex are lifting Tinkertoy as weights.  Buzz works out on top of an upside down Robo using his feet as a treadmill. Potato Head attempts to lift his Tinkertoy barbell but en up tumbling backwards, leaving his arms connected to the barbell. H) Woody looks under the bed for Slinky, finding only the checkerboard. Woody peeks around the corner of the bed to see Slinky an Robot, under Buzz's direction, setting Buzz's \"ship\" up o top of ABC blocks for repair. In frustration, Woody kicks the checkerboard, sending the pieces flying.  One of the checkers ricochets off the dresser and boomerangs into Woody's mouth. I) On Andy's bed, Buzz pets Slinky whose back end is stretched over to the other side where Woody sits.  Slink wagging tail whacks Woody in the face repeatedly. Woody shoves Slinky's rear end off the bed, leaving his front end no choice but to eventually follow. J) At bedtime, Andy loads his toys into the toybox until just Woody and Buzz are left.  He deliberates as to which toy to keep and which to toss into the toybox."
