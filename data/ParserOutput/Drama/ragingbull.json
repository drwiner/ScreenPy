I mean, jail up north is gotta be like summer camp compared to jail down in cracker country. And if you're a guy like me, you ain't got a chance in a place like that. Especially if you're Italian... you come from the Bronx... and you're an ex-champ. As soon as they saw me... soon as they heard me... I know I'm in trouble. To me, they got an accent, and to them, I got an accent! You gotta get the picture -- I'm big, I got small hands, I walk like I'm still in the ring... the balls of my feet pop up and down, you know... and whenever I get the chance, I read a lot. So naturally, takin' all this into sideration, they figure it adds up to one thing -- I'm queer! Now I didn't mind too much when they called me \"Queer\" or \"Mr. Tough Guy\" or \"Yankee Punk\"... But one day these screws got to me... I was workin' on the work gang, pickin' up some trees that were knocked down by a storm or somethin' and puttin' 'em on this truck. All of a sudden... one of the trees slipped and fell on me and pinned me to the ground. I'm lyin' there with a tree across my chest! This screw walks over, takin' his time, he looks down at me and says, \"Well, Champ Pimp... you lyin' down on the job again?\"! They got a great sense of humor when they're standin' there with a gun in their arms and you got a tree on your chest! So I look up at him and say, \"Oh, this tree... it fell on me.\" And he says, \"Oh, I'm sorry... If I'd have known, I would've yelled 'timber'\" I said, \"Hey, look... it hurts. I think maybe I broke somethin'!\" He says, \"Well, whaddaya know... Champ PImp's got himself a boo-boo.\" Then I got as stupid as him. I said, \"If I'm Champ Pimp... how 'bout givin' me the money you made last night?\"! Then another screw comes over and says, \"This Yankee creep givin' you trouble?\" -- What kind of trouble? What am I gonna do -- hit 'em with the tree? Now anybody else in their right mind would've said, \"No sir, I wouldn't think of giving any of you gentlemen trouble... I just want to serve my time and get the hell out of here as soon as I can.\" That's anybody else. When I said it... it was a little different. \"You stupid cracker... take your hands off me or I'll get up and kick your brains out -- but first you gotta bend over so I can find 'em!\" Next thing I know I'm in the hole. Solitary confinement. All my life I had guys in my corner yellin' \"Go get 'em, jake... kill 'em! You're the greatest.\" Now there's nobody rootin' for me. But it wasn't so bad. I learned things there. I learned how to scratch a calendar on the wall. I never knew how to do that before. Now I know. Monday is one scratch. Tuesday is two scratches. Wednesday is three scratches. And so on. Except for Sundays. Sundays is no scratches. Sundays rested."
