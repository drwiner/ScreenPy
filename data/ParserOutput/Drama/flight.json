Then at 9:42, according to the data recorders, a decision was made to invert the aircraft. The NTSB has created animated simulation that I would like to play at this point. ELLEN points to the screen... An NTSB animation shows the plane pitching down and we fo it through the inversion of the plane while listening to real audio of the flight crew. The animation has a split screen that also shows the instruments and printed text of what's being said. We hear...\"What's your son's name?\" \"Why?\" \"The black box \"I love you, Trevor. Be a good boy, Mommy loves you.\" \"Wh are we doing?! Why would I trim down?!\" \"We're gonna roll it. Ready? Here we go.
