If the Jews are, as one of their own has said, a people who will not take yes for an answer, then let us say yes to them. If they thrive on opposition, let us cease to oppose them. The way to annihilate them, utterly and completely, is to open our arms, take them into our homes and embrace them. Only then will they vanish into assimilation, dilution...and love.
