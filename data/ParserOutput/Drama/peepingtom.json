CLOSE SHOT of Helen looking round in amazement. As certain events of possible interest are to take place  in this room, here, in detail, is what amazes Helen. The room is the product of three rooms which have been  knocked into one. It is very large and extremely well  constructed (as we are soon to learn, it was originally a laboratory). One half of the room is used for processing, and the other half for filming - and for trade shows. The two halves are lined by long shelves upon which are perch all shapes and sizes of cameras, their spectacles glintin in the light. In the processing half two benches (a 'dry' bench and a  'wet' bench) face each other against opposite walls. Ther are three sinks above the 'wet' bench and an outburst of  equipment above the 'dry'. This part of the room is lit by two dark-room lamps frown in the ceiling above the benches. The other part of the room has a window at the far end of it. Heavy drapes are putted across it. Mark's projector rests on a small table in front of the  16mm screen.  Two banks of floods and a variety of spots  light this part of the room. There is a small control pan on the wall.   Some of the equipment is ancient - but none of it is old. All of it glistens with the affection of its owner. There is absolutely nothing in the room to alarm anyone  except an adult... the kind who starts to wonder who paid for it all. CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He stands by the lighting panel,  watching Helen. From his POV WE SEE her brushing the hair out of her eyes as she looks slowly round. He brushes the hair out of his For a moment she turns her back to him. He presses a swit on the wall. A gentle light ripples through the back of  Helen's hair. SHOT of Helen. She turns to him. She is very nearly at a  loss for words."

She cannot manage it the first time - and keeps on watching, then, like a child waking from a nightmare,  she jerks herself away from the table, and stumbles towar the door.
