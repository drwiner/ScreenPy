Here comes the Toughest at a lazy gallop. He's riding onl with his legs. His hands are busy with bow and arrows. Ca but blink quick, the Toughest snatches another arrow from the quiver at his waist, strings it and fires. This arrow catches Timmons in the gut. He falls squirming against th slope. The Toughest is still coming, his face like granite as he fires arrow after arrow. The three warriors who came with the Toughest have reache the wagon. Two of them are slicing away harness on the te of nice army horses. The third is rifling through Timmons gear. This man unwittingly picks up Timmons' blanket. Whe he gets a whiff of its stink, the warrior flings it far o on the grass. Then he drops to one knee, scoops up some d and rubs it between his soiled hands."

He stops now and lowers the pipe. He stares down. The pip seems almost alive as it lays in his hands. Dunbar hands the pipe back, and as Kicking Bird takes it hears the light tinkling of bells.

Just ahead the forest opens into an  incredible cathedral-like expanse. Sunlight streams down  onto the floor in beautiful pools.

Trees have been felled everywhere, most of them left to r for no explicable reason.

They are flies and they are swa over dozens of carcasses strewn over the ground. Badgers, skunks, squirrels and other small animals, nearly all of  them killed merely for target practice. The men and their ponies move on. Deer carcasses are  everywhere, many of them horribly mutilated. A choice fla portion is cut away here and there, while ninety-five per of the bodies have been left to rot. Heads and legs have been chopped off. Dances With Wolves  passes by a spot where several deer heads have been place nose to nose as if the heads were having a conversation.  Someone's perverted idea of humor. The men ride through the carnage in a sad daze. Now they reach the center of the cathedral and here they  find a few crude leantos, hewn from freshly cut wood.
