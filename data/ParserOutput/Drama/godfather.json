SONNY grabs hold of CARLO's massive body, and tries to dr him off of the hold on the railing, his teeth clenched in the effort.  Then he tries loosening CARLO's locked hands even biting them.  CARLO screams but he does not let go. It's clear that CARLO is much stronger than he is, and wi not be moved.  SONNY knees him in the mouth, and beats hi more; but he is exhausted.

Then BARZINI in a black homburg, standing a long time. MICHAEL watches the scene. BARZINI crosses himself and passes on, immediately rejoin by his men.
