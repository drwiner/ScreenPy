As they look into each other's eye Truman goes to say something but Veronica hushes him by p a finger to his lips.  Then abruptly she moves out of fra cardigan falling from around her shoulders in her haste. From Truman's POV we focus on the cardigan on the pavemen triggering a flashback in his head."
