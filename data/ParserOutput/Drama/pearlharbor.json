The plane reaches the top of its arc, and almost stalls; but Rafe noses it over again, toward the earth, only this time he has very little altitude.  The p hurtles down, still with it belly on the inside of the curve... And makes it full circle.  Rafe's head now is barely a fo off the asphalt as the plane shoots past, still inverted. THE OTHER PILOTS burst into cheers. RAFE, IN HIS COCKPIT permits himself a smile. He lands, and the guys run out to meet him...all except f the Training Captain, who stands there shaking his head. Danny jumps on the wing, as Rafe stops and slides back hi canopy.  Danny grabs him by the harness and shakes him."

Thirteen planes crash landed in China, where the Chinese people helped the Americans escape, and had their villages destroyed and citizens executed by the Japanese forces of occupation.  Two crews were captured by the Japanese and three fliers were executed without trial, called \"war criminals\" by the Japanese.  Jimmy Doolittle was promoted to General, and given the medal of honor."
