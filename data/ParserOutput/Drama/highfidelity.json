Average.  A  middleweight.  Not the smartest guy  in the world, but certainly not the  dumbest.  I've read books like The  Unbearable Lightness of Being,  Angela's Ashes, and Love in the Time  of Cholera, and understood them, I  think -- they're about girls, right? --  just kidding -- but I don't like  them very much.  My all time top  five favorite books are Johnny Cash's  autobiography, Snow Crash by Neil  Stevenson, Zen and the Art of  Motorcycle Maintenance, The Trouser  Press Guides to Rock, and, I don't  know, probably something by Kurt  Vonnegut.  I look through the New  Yorker when my neighbor's done with  it, and I'm not averse to going down  to the Fine Arts to watch subtitles  films, although on the whole I prefer  American films.  Top five being Blade  Runner, Cool Hand Luke, the first  two Godfathers which we'll count as  one, Taxi Driver, and The Shining.   I'm okay looking, average height,  not skinny, not fat.  My genius, if  I can call it that, is to combine a  whole load of averageness into one  compact frame.  You might say there  were millions like me, but there  aren't, really: Alot of guys have  impeccable music taste but don't  read, alot of guys read but are really  fat, alot of guys are sympathetic to  women but have stupid beards, alot  of guys have a Woody Allen sense of  humor but look like Woody Allen.   Some drink too much, some drive like  assholes, some get into fights, or  show off money, or do drugs.  I don't  do any of these things, really.  If  I do okay with women it's not because  of the virtues I have, but because  of the ugly flaws I don't have...  So.  Charlie and I didn't match.   After her I was determined to never  get out of my league again."

Maybe fifty or so have one or  more of these attributes, but that  still leaves... well, about nine  million, give or take fifty.  And  they're just men.  Regular guys.   We're just guys, because I, even I,  am a member of this exclusive, nine  million member club.  In fact, Marie  is my seventeenth lover. \"How does  he do it?\" you ask. \"He wears bad  sweaters, he's grumpy, he's broke,  he hangs out with the Musical Moron  Twins, and he gets to go to bed with  a recording artist who looks like  Susan Dey-slash-Meg Ryan.  What's  going on?  Listen up, because I think  I can explain, with all modesty aside:  I ask questions.  That's it.  That's  my secret.  It works precisely because  that isn't how you're supposed to do  it, if you listen to the collective  male wisdom.  There are still enough  old-style, big-mouthed, egomaniacs  running around to make someone like  me appear to be refreshingly  different.  If you can't hack this  simple strategy, there are some women  out there, of course, who want to  get pushed around, ignored and mowed  over, but do you really want to be  with them anyway?"

I know I'm not born to run,  and it's clear that Halsted Street  is nothing like Thunder Road, but  feelings can't be that different,  can they?  I'd like to call up all  those people and ask them how they  are and whether they've forgiven me,  and tell them that I have forgiven  them.  And say good luck, goodbye.   No hard feelings.
