He is doing everything with deliberate quietness, taking the occasional glance towards the bedro to check he's not making too much noise. He is boiling an egg, which he takes out of boiling water and puts on a sparkling clean plate. MICHAEL puts the yolk-stained egg-cup and plate into the sink, his breakfast eaten, then, as noiseless as he can, turns on the tap to run water. The bedroom door opens, an BRIGITTE comes out, naked. She's attractive, younger. The credits end."
