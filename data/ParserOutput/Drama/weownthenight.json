He is SMILING, receiving many AD-LIBBED CONGRATULATIONS and holding one of his children in his arms, infant PAUL. Nex to him is his wife, SANDRA, thirties. Next to her, their older infant, TEDDY. NEXT TO JOSEPH: BURT GRUSINSKY, sixty. Bobby's father, we will soon learn. Tough as nails. Unsentimental, ex- military, rough-edged, vital. In this world, he is a king Standing behind Burt are his two closest associates: MICHAEL SOLO (\"G.Q.\"), fifties, somewhat urbane, and JACK SHAPIRO (\"Pudge\"), also fifties. A big, quiet man. Huge hands. The enforcer. Burt is beaming over his treasured son. He directs a PHOTOGRAPHER, repositions Joseph:"
