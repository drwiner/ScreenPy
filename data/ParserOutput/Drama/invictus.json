Fanning out behind each scrum are the backs -- faster, mo glamorous players who will run with the ball, or kick it. The Lions scrumhalf thrusts the ball into the maw of the scrum, the huge men lock up against each other with maxim force. The ball comes out the back of the Lions' scrum, the scrumhalf dive-passes it away to the backs, who flick it laterally to the wing, with lightning speed. The wing lofts a delicate kick just over the onrushing Springbok defenders. The Lions charge the ball, which bounces erratically -- -- right into the hands of the man who kicked it. One las burst of speed, one quick juke to avoid a desperation tac and the wing scores in the corner. As the Lions kicker gets ready to convert the try, we fin the Springboks huddling under their goal posts, hands on their hips, stunned. 26. At the center of the huddle Pienaar bleeds behind his gum guard as, furiously, he tries to inject some fire into hi team."

Especially because, this day, the All Blacks push the hak closer and closer to the Springboks -- -- who do not back down. In fact, they close ranks and advance. Major, major international smackdown. This is not fake. T emotions, the aggression are real. ON MANDELA, whose diplomatic mask slips a little showing warrior's glitter in his eyes. He wants to respond, primally. His fists clench at his side. The HAKA ENDS with a fearsome, guttural Maori yell. ON THE SPRINGBOKS, massed together, faces red with emotio pulses racing. Mandela takes a deep breath in.

We have only seen snippets of rugby, so far. And mostly f a somewhat polite distance -- the usual distance of TV coverage. Say, at closest, the referee's point of view. Not now. Not for the climax. We experience this beautiful piece of mayhem up close and personal. We're inside the heaving scrums. We are the ball. We see the way cleats leave a pattern of round white dimples on abused skin, which quickly turn to purple as they fill wi subcutaneous blood. 136. We feel a tackle in our own spine; we see teeth sink into flesh in the intimacy of a loose scrum; we feel a hard fi smacking us again and again in the hot privacy of a rolli maul. For this is not a pretty match, not for one moment -- jus the Springbok coach wanted. This match is all about a less talented team stifling the best team in the world by sheer determination and fitness This is about the Springboks applying continuous, unrelen pressure, and forcing the vaunted All Black attack into making mistakes. Lots of them. Dropped balls, errant passes, knock-ons. No fluency of movement, no electric building of momentum. Because of one thing: tackling. Tackling and tackling and tackling again. The first time Lomu touches the ball, the stadium, the na holds its breath -- -- until the Springbok wing scythes into him at thigh hei wraps him up and brings him down. The second time Lomu gets the ball he is brought down fro behind by Pienaar, with a picture perfect tackle. We can cut away to the faces of the spectators when we wa from Mandela to Nerine to Sipho and on and on, all over t country. But, in truth, our attention belongs on the fiel ON PIENAAR, continually exhorting his men, leading by example, wreaking havoc in the All Black backfield. ON LOMU, who always seems just one broken tackle away fro running one in -- except that there are no broken tackles ON THIRTY BIG, STRONG, BATTLE-SCARRED MEN, who have devot their entire lives to this moment. They are not playing f money. They are playing for pride, for their countries. Outdated notions. We miss them. No tries are scored in the Final. The two fly halves matc each other, penalty goal for penalty goal. With each made kick, the goal posts shrink for the next. penalty goals are unchallenged. It is up to the kicker to make them or fail. That is pressure. 137. The score is 6 - 6 when, just before half time, the Sprin fly half takes a long, perfect pass from the scrum half, with the All Black defenders looming, kicks a drop goal through the uprights. The Springboks lead 9 - 6. A tight match. So tight, in fact, that there is only one score in the se half -- an All Black drop goal that levels the score at 9 9. Until right before the end of the match, when the All Bla camp in the Springbok half. The scrum half sends a long, spiralling pass to the fly h who is in perfect position to go for a drop goal. The kick soars into the air, high and straight. 43 million South Africans hold their breath. All around the world, fans lean forward on their chairs. This will be the decisive blow. But the kick just goes wide. Relief. The referee blows his whistle to signal the end of regulation. Both teams are spent."
