The reason she left didn't  have anything to do with you. (pause, this is very  painful) Look, I don't know if this will make  any sense to you, okay? But I'll try  and explain. You see the reason your  mom left was because... Well, I guess  it was because I kept trying to make  her into a certain kind of person...  Make her be the way I thought a wife  was supposed to be. Only she wasn't  like that. She was... (smiles to himself) Well, she wasn't like that. And now,  when I think about it, I can see she  tried very hard to be like I wanted  very hard. And when she couldn't,  then she tried to tell me about it.  Only I wouldn't listen. I guess I  thought that if I was happy, that  meant she was happy too. Only she  wasn't. The truth is, the only reason  she didn't leave a lot sooner was  because she loves you so much. Joanna  stayed until she couldn't stand me  any longer and then she left... But  it wasn't you, pal. It wasn't you."

So do I. But the way it  was explained to me, that's not the  issue. The only thing that's supposed  to matter here is what's best for  Billy... When Joanna said why  shouldn't a woman have the same  ambitions as a man, I suppose she's  right. But by the same token what  law is it that says a woman is a  better parent simply by virtue of  her sex? I guess I've had to think a  lot about whatever it is that makes  somebody a good parent: constancy,  patience, understanding... love.  Where is it written that a man has  any less of those qualities than a  woman? Billy has a home with me,  I've tried to make it the best I  could. It's not perfect. I'm not a  perfect parent.
