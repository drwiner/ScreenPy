Today they've taken off sheets and put on police uniforms, they've  traded in the bloodhounds for police dogs. And  just as Uncle Tom back during slavery used to  keep the Negroes from resisting the bloodhounds  or resisting the Ku Klux Klan by telling them  to love their enemy or pray for those who use  them as spitefully today.

In the past I thought  the thoughts, spoke the words of the Honorable  Elijah Muhammad, that day is over. From now on  I speak my own words, and think my own thoughts.  Internal differences within the Nation of Islam  forced me out of it. I did not leave of my own  free will. But now that it has happened, I  intend to make the most of it. Now that I have  more independence of action, I intend to use a  more flexible approach toward working with  others to get a solution to this problem. I do  not pretend to be a divine man, but I do  believe in divine guidance, divine power, and  in the fulfillment of divine prophecy. I am not  educated, nor am I an expert in any particular  field, but I am sincere, and my sincerity is my  credentials. I'm not out to fight other Negro  leaders or organizations. We must find a common  solution, to a common problem. I am going to  organize and head a new mosque in New York  City, known as the Muslim Mosque, Inc. This  gives us a religious base, and the spiritual  force necessary to rid our people of the vices  that destroy the moral fiber of our community.  Our political philosophy will be black  nationalism. Our economic and social philosophy  will be black nationalism. The Muslim Mosque,  Inc. will remain wide open for ideas and  financial aid from all quarters. Whites can  help us, but they can't join us. There can be  no black-white unity until there is first some  black unity.
