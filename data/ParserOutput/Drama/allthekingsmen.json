He knew what it was to  get up before dawn and get feed and  slop and milk before breakfast...  and then set out before sunup and  walk six miles to a one-room, slab- sided schoolhouse. Oh, this hick  knew what it was to be a hick, all  right. He figured if he was going to  get anything done, he had to do it  himself. So he sat up nights and  studied books. He studied law because  he thought he might be able to change  things some... for himself, and for  folks like him."

It killed and mangled a dozen kids.  But you know that story. The people  were his friends because he fought  that rotten brick. And some of the  politicians down in the city, they  knew that...
