He pulls his shirt out and sees dark spots forming there. He holds his palm out flat in front of him. The rain pools. He rubs the water through his thumb and fingers.

To get a better view, Curtis moves from beneath a tree in corner of the yard and surveys the large swath of farmlan that runs up to his property. Chain-link fencing partitions the yard from a deep concre culvert that leads out to the open field. A giant STORM CELL gathers force on the horizon there. Red barks incessantly. He winces and strains against the rope tied to his collar. Curtis flinches again as A BOLT OF LIGHTNING streaks to t ground in the distance. Sparks shoot into the air leaving circle of scorched crops. Another CRACK of thunder. 10. A light rain begins. Red snaps his head around and bucks into the air. He gnashes at the rope. Curtis collects Hannah off the playscape and turns back t the approaching STORM CELL. He holds up his hand and stud the falling rain. It's the thick, amber colored liquid. With Hannah in his arms, Curtis watches, awestruck, as wi tentacles drip to the ground forming a collection of THRE TORNADOS out in the field. Behind them, Red's teeth fray the rope at his collar. He thrashes his head, the rope SNAPS, and the dog flies towa Curtis and Hannah. Curtis turns to see Red charging them. He barely has time set Hannah down before Red catches him by the forearm. They crash to the ground, tangled together. Rain coming d hard now. Curtis yells and waves Hannah back. Red, snapping, buries his teeth into the muscles in Curtis' arm. Blood streams from the wound.

His breathing comes under control. His attention turns to something else. Something under the sheets. Curtis pulls back the bed sheets. The mattress is soaked YELLOW urine. This scares him. His hand trembles as he reaches out to touch his wet boxe The toilet FLUSHES. Footsteps in heels. Curtis quickly pulls the covers back up. Samantha enters bedroom. She pulls her hair into a tight ponytail and pic earrings off a nearby dresser, her back to Curtis."
