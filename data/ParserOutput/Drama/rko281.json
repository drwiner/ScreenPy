They were all  on the old man's yacht taking a nice jaunt from  Pedro down to San Diego. Real foggy night it was.  This was Hearst, Marion, Ince, Charlie Chaplin,  Louella, the usual gorillas. So Hearst notices  Marion slip off with Chaplin -- she was screwing  everyone then -- and the old man goes nuts. Grabs  his revolver and starts shooting. Just like Tom Mix,  standing there blasting away through the fog. Boom - - boom -- boom -- and Thomas Ince takes a bullet  through the head. So now there's this dead guy lying  on the deck. You'll see how this could be quite an  embarrassment. So the empire goes into action. Nice  and quiet and Ince was cremated lickety-split. No  inquest and no police. It was right after this that  Hearst gives Louella her life-time contract. Just to  keep her all hush-hush."
