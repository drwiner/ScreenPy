JACQUES reaches them in a matter of seconds.  Turns the brakes, brings his machine to a halt, 180 feet down. The medics are waiting for him there.  They take his pulse.  Check his eyes... 15 seconds... normal... the bubbles from there scuba tanks churn the water around them... JACQUES closes his eyes... a tap on the shoulder, he releases the brake on the gueuse.  Plunges further, this time into pitch black. Below him a faint spotlight glows on the bottom.  He reaches it and the dark diver moves to him.  JACQUES brakes his machine.  Moving very slowly, turns his body right side up.  Like a sleep walker, JACQUES starts to take the plaque off the plumbline... pauses in the middle of the gesture. The dark diver flashes the high sign to JACQUES, thumb an forefinger touching, fingers extended, all clear.  JACQUE does not respond.  The diver repeats the signal.  JACQUES does not respond. The diver taps JACQUES on the shoulder... a beat... and then JACQUES responds, thumb and forefinger touching okay Slowly, reluctantly, he wraps his hand around the handle of the balloon. The dark diver quickly turns the handle for him.  The balloon inflates.  JACQUES hangs on... lets it carry him up. At the plague marking 210 feet, JACQUES lets go of the th balloon.  With a burst of speed, it darts toward the surface. JACQUES follows slowly, undulating like a fish... He's getting warm now... He closes his eyes. Passes the medical control without stopping... without even seeing it like someone asleep. He's moving faster now, toward the warmth, toward the air JACQUES opens his eyes, watches the lights grow brighter. The silhouette of the boat comes back into view.  60 feet to go."

All the muscles of their bodies stretch to their limits. JACQUES, progressively, finds himself disappearing.  His image dissolves point by point... disintegrates into unbroken blue... The effect creates the impression of someone melting, the screen is now totally blue. A thin, HIGH-PITCHED SOUND. From the bottom of the image, a tiny pinpoint starts TOWARD the CAMERA.  It is JACQUES, naked, swimming out of the deep blue ocean toward the light as if he were coming out of a dive.  He comes CLOSER and CLOSER to the CAMERA... Until his head almost touches the lens... A sudden DEAFENING NOISE... and we find JACQUES on top of JOHANA.  He looks down at her, speechless."

Standing at the helm, looking like Christopher Columbus his hair brushed back by the wind, is ENZO. Next to him hanging on to the windscreen is an impressive six foot, dark haired beauty.  She has a scarf over her hair.  She wears a purple leather micro-mini with a ceris halter top and her ruby fingernails are three inches long If she ever actually would get cast in a movie, she'd mak Raquel Welch hide in shame.  Her stage name is BONITA MARIPOSA. ENZO kills the THROTTLE, swings the speedboat into a perfect landing at the dock.  ROBERTO takes the lines."

The dolphin meets his group, about ten of them, 250 Kg of muscles, swimming at more than 40 km/H underwater.  They all break through the surface to gulp air regularly. Suddenly, one of them, leaves the group.  He crosses the blue and seems to make sonar-like sounds.  We see a sonar picture.  It's an image in which the dolphin will appear few seconds later.  The dolphin comes up like a rocket, gulps air and goes back down. The sonar image appears again.  Finally, the dolphin, locates a group of fish and starts hunting them, exactly like a war plane.  He manages to break the group in two, then in four, and this way, he isolates his victim. He breaks the surface to gulp air and goes back down.  He goes full power.  The fish he is after are even more divided.  There is only one left, totally lost and in a panic. The exhausted fish is swallowed. The dolphin slows down, goes back up, breaks the surface in slow motion.  Images becomes pale and bright. He screams inhumanly. Image is white, black, silence."
