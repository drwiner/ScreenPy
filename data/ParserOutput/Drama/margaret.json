On stage, the two women start singing barcarole \"Belle Nuit.\" It's very beautiful. Joan looks next to her at Lisa. Lisa is trying not to cry but tears are dripping slowly down her face. She sniffs a wipes them away, but they keep coming. Joan looks at her again, but Lisa still won't look at her Joan takes Lisa's hand and Lisa breaks down completely, clutching Joan's hand back, squeezing it hard. Joan start crying too out of sympathy. As the duet goes on they sit side by side holding hands, crying and holding on and wiping her eyes with her free h and Joan crying too, but not as hard, grateful finally th the spell has been broken. The duet ends and we CUT TO BLACK. THE END"
