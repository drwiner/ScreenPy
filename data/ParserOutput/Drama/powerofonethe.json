The rules are different for everything, in games as well as in the rest of our lives. The managers, the foremen, the company people. They live apart from the miners. They have families. Proper gardens. Sunday dinners. The miners--the crud, as we are called -- don't. This is a society of men, many of whom have pasts better left behind. Future does not apply. It is a society only in the loosest sense of the word. The laws of survival are simple-- you either do or you don't. PK comes down a side street. A half a dozen men at cards, hard-faced desperadoes, see him pass, eyeing him closely. PK averts his eyes. From behind his back comes the sound of LIPS PUCKERING loudly, indecently. PK swallows hard. The sound of a CHARGE turns him to the six men bolting from their card game after him, whooping with lascivious intent. PK takes off. The chase takes PK and his pursuers flying through the streets of the camp, past one identical cement hut after another.  People watch, disinterested. No one raises a hand to help. PK comes racing around the corner to three of the men"

The miners outside, crowding three deep, yell and shout. People start to make bets. Botha charges PK as PK scrambles up. Botha swings. The blow glances off PK's shoulder and sends him flying, spinning over a table. Botha leaps at PK, driving him into the wall. PK grimaces, sagging. Botha picks him up and starts to squeeze him to death in his massive arms. PK, his hands free, starts to pound on Botha's ears with his palms. Botha screams as the powder head- ache accelerates through the top of his skull. He drops PK. PK rolls away and swings a stool at Botha's midsection. Botha is driven back. PK goes to swing the stool again. Botha catches it as if it were made of balsa. He rips it out of PK's hand and flings it back at him, charging behind it. PK goes topping end over end. Botha gets a hand on him and lifts him from behind. He flings PK over the bar. PK hits the floor, stunned. Botha pulls at the bar trying to get at PK. He rocks the bar and rocks the bar as PK is trying to regain his bearings. Finally, with one tremendous rip, the bar comes away from its bolting. Botha pulls it aside. PK rises just as Botha moves in. PK hits him three solid shots to the stomach but Botha hardly feels them. He grabs PK and starts to squeeze him again.
