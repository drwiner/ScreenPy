David is such a clod, passing out in the back seat, his legs hanging out over the door of the car, one sandal missing. His beautiful face is somehow an obscene parody of itself, fiery red from the sun. Oliver mimics David, Petulia, the guard at the gate, dances, skips, romps, annoys Petulia, makes her laugh, dares her, goads her. Finally, when Petulia's car is just one away from the border guard, Oliver impudently hops into the seat beside her, expecting to be thrown out but also expecting maybe a nickel in the bargain. But the joke's on Oliver. Petulia is even kookier than he is. Is it the look of David that sickens her? Is it her annoyance at having to wait so long and do the driving while he lies collapsed and useless? Is it that \"useless\" that goads her? 53"

Petulia stops the car a few hundred yards past the border to let Oliver climb out, but he just sits there. Petulia thinks, \"okay, you little bastard . \" and zooms down the highway, intending to stop at the first moment the look of superior arrogance leaves Oliver's tough little face. During this we hear Archie and Petulia's second tele- phone conversation which is as blab and loving as before. ARCHIE: Hi, there. PETULIA: Hello. ARCHIE: I'm having lunch with the boys. PETULIA: You eat a good lunch, Archie, ARCHIE: I will, I will. PETULIA: You only had a cup of coffee for breakfast. ARCHIE: I'll eat a good lunch, Petulia. PETULIA: Like what? ARCHIE: Petulia, they have a thousand different things on the menu. PETULIA: You should have a sirloin steak with french fries or baked beans. ARCHIE: Okay. PETULIA: That's easy to say, Archie, But I know you. ARCHIE: Steak with french fries or baked beans. PETULIA: Do they have fresh sea-food? ARCHIE: Yes. PETULIA: Sea bass is nice. ARCHIE: Yes, sea bass is great. PETULIA: If they grill it, ARCHIE: I'll have grilled sea bass. PETULIA: Unless they do a nice omelet. ARCHIE: I'm sure they would if I asked.
