Life's  work, criticisms, political  aspirations. But you couldn't tell  me what it smells like in the Sistine  Chapel. You've never stood there and  looked up at that beautiful ceiling.  And if I asked you about women I'm  sure you could give me a syllabus of  your personal favorites, and maybe  you've been laid a few times too. But you couldn't tell me how it feels  to wake up next to a woman and be  truly happy. If I asked you about  war you could refer me to a bevy of  fictional and non-fictional material,  but you've never been in one. You've  never held your best friend's head  in your lap and watched him draw his  last breath, looking to you for help.  And if I asked you about love I'd  get a sonnet, but you've never looked  at a woman and been truly vulnerable.  Known that someone could kill you  with a look. That someone could rescue  you from grief. That God had put an  angel on Earth just for you.  And  you wouldn't know how it felt to be  her angel. To have the love be there  for her forever. Through anything,  through cancer. You wouldn't know  about sleeping sitting up in a  hospital room for two months holding  her hand and not leaving because the  doctors could see in your eyes that  the term \"visiting hours\" didn't  apply to you. And you wouldn't know  about real loss, because that only  occurs when you lose something you  love more than yourself, and you've  never dared to love anything that  much. I look at you and I don't see  an intelligent confident man, I don't  see a peer, and I don't see my equal.  I see a boy. Nobody could possibly  understand you, right Will? Yet you  presume to know so much about me  because of a painting you saw.  You  must know everything about me.  You're  an orphan, right?"

And  I'm real happy with myself, 'cause I  did my job well.  But maybe that  code was the location of some rebel  army in North Africa or the Middle  East. Once they have that location,  they bomb the village where the rebels  were hiding and fifteen hundred people  I never had a problem with get killed.  (rapid fire) Now the politicians are  sayin' \"send in the Marines to secure  the area\" 'cause they don't give a  shit. It won't be their kid over  there, gettin' shot. Just like it  wasn't them when their number got  called, 'cause they were pullin' a  tour in the National Guard. It'll be  some guy from Southie takin' shrapnel  in the ass.  And he comes home to  find that the plant he used to work  at got exported to the country he  just got back from. And the guy who  put the shrapnel in his ass got his  old job, 'cause he'll work for fifteen  cents a day and no bathroom breaks.  Meanwhile my buddy from Southie  realizes the only reason he was over  there was so we could install a  government that would sell us oil at  a good price. And of course the oil  companies used the skirmish to scare  up oil prices so they could turn a  quick buck. A cute, little ancillary  benefit for them but it ain't helping  my buddy at two-fifty a gallon. And  naturally they're takin' their sweet  time bringin' the oil back and maybe  even took the liberty of hiring an  alcoholic skipper who likes to drink  seven and sevens and play slalom  with the icebergs and it ain't too  long 'til he hits one, spills the  oil, and kills all the sea-life in  the North Atlantic. So my buddy's  out of work and he can't afford to  drive so he's got to walk to the job  interviews which sucks 'cause the  shrapnel in his ass is givin' him  chronic hemorrhoids.  And meanwhile  he's starvin' 'cause every time he  tries to get a bite to eat the only  blue-plate special they're servin'  is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker  State."
