Inside the cab, playing on the radio, is Angelique Kidjo's funky song \"Batonga\". Then, the rear door to the cab opens and in an EXTREME CL UP we see ZED, a young man with wild, almost mesmerizing shielded by small round glasses, and with a head of nappy hair.  His face has drops on it from the flurry outside. He settles himself, then looks to the CAB DRIVER, an easy going Senegalese/Frenchman, in the front seat."
