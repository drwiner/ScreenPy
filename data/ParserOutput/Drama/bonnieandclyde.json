As the camera slowly pulls back from the closeup we see that we have been looking into a mirror.  She is standing before full-length mirror in her bedroom doing her make-up.  She overdoes it in the style of the time: rosebud mouth and s forth.  As the film progresses her make-up will be refine until, at the end, there is none. The camera pulls back and continues to move very slowly throughout the first part of this scene.  As the camera continues to move away, we see, by degrees, that BONNIE i naked.  Her nudity is never blatantly revealed to the audience, but implied.  That is, she should be \"covered\" various ways from the camera's P.O.V., but the audience m be aware of her exposure to CLYDE later in the scene.  Th is the only time in the film that she will ever be this exposed, in all senses of the word, to the audience.  Her attitude and appraisal of herself here are touched with narcissism. The bedroom itself is a second-story bedroom in a lower- class frame house in West Dallas, Texas.  The neighborhoo is low income.  Though the room reveals its shabby surroundings, it also reveals an attempt by BONNIE to fix up.  Small and corny objets d'art are all over the tops o the bureaus, vanity tables, etc. (Little glass figurines porcelain statuettes and the like.) BONNIE finishes admiring herself.  She walks from the mir and moves slowly across the room, the camera moving with her, until she reaches the screened window on the opposit wall.  The shade is up.  There are no curtains.  She look out the window, looking down, and the camera looks down w her. EXT. BEDROOM.  BONNIE'S P.O.V.  DAY. Over her shoulder, we see the driveway leading to the gar connected to the house.  There is an old car parked in th driveway, its windows open.  We see a man walking up the driveway, somewhat furtively.  He is a rather dapper fell dressed in a dark suit with a vest, a white collar, and a straw boater.  It is CLYDE BARROW.  Obviously, he is abou to steal the car.  He looks it over, checking around him make sure no passers-by are coming.  He peers inside the front window to see if the keys are in the ignition.  He studies the dashboard.  BONNIE continues watching, silent Finally she calls out."

INT. SECOND CAR.  DAY. At the top of the laugh, cut to the int. of the second ca riding right in back of them.  The atmosphere is complete unlike the cozy and jolly scene preceding.  We have dead silence.  BONNIE is driving, smoking a cigarette, grim. BLANCHE--seated as far away as she can get from BONNIE without falling out of the car--makes a face at the cigar smoke, rolls down the window for air.  C.W.'s in the back seat, just staring."

But the laws fooled around, Kept taking him down And locking him in a cell, Till he said to me, \"I'll never be free So I'll meet a few of them in hell.\" The road was so dimly lighted; There were no highway signs to guide; But they made up their minds If all roads were blind, They wouldn't give up till they died."

Th see ahead of them an incredible shooting match and, in terror, they jam on the brakes and leap out of the truck. They run as fast as they can into the meadow, away from t trouble. The gun fight takes just seconds during which law fires eight-seven shots at BONNIE and CLYDE, giving them absolu no chance.  The sound is rapid, deafening. At no point in the gun fight do we see BONNIE and CLYDE i motion.  We see, instead, two still photographs cut into sequence: one of Clyde, half out of the car, taking caref dead aim with his gun, just as he did in the teaching sce one of BONNIE, in terror, a pack of cigarettes in her han clutched tight, looking as fragile and beautiful as she c be. The noise stops at once.  Utter silence.  It has been a massacre.  BONNIE and CLYDE never had a chance to return gunfire.  We see the car, a complete shambles.  We never BONNIE and CLYDE dead, though for a moment we discern the bodies slumped in the car. The camera pulls above the car until it is on a level wit the opposite side of the road.  Then, slowly, the six law stand up in the trench.  On the faces of the five deputie horror and shock at what they have just done.  HAMER, however, registers no emotion.  His face is a blank.  He lights a cigarette.  Slowly, slowly, the five men begin t edge closer to the car to see the result.  Music, the wil country breakdown music, begins on the sound track."
