He breaks off from the Girls, follows Jerome to the backstage entrance where they're joined by other MEMBERS of The Time -- JESSE and JELLYBEAN among them.

Morris listens with a complacent grin on his face, his eyes searching out various members of The Time who are scattered through-out the club.  When he connects with one of them he makes a series of absurd faces which sends them into hysterics.  For Prince is playing music that The Time is noted for, and, as far as Morris is concerned, performs better. Not everyone in the club is dancing, or paying attention, and this does not escape his notice. Suddenly \"G-Spot\" comes to a rousing end.  The CROWD cheers wildly.  Prince moves quickly to the piano and launches into \"Electric Intercourse,\" a love ballad which, as it progresses, becomes a personal statement for Vanity and Prince himself. She listens intently, her eyes fastened on him.  The words have a profound effect on her -- and the audience. Without being consciously aware of it, they're moving closer to the stage, searching for their personal fix. Prince surrenders himself to the music totally, releasing from himself all that is hurtful -- releasing the sincerity and truthfulness that escapes him in his daily life.  We are entering  realm where life and music are inextricably bound, and the impact on the performer and listener is profound. He's directing his music toward her, and she receives it gratefully, almost anxiously.  It fills a void in her, hewn by a life of meaningless promises.  He searches her face with his magnificent eyes, and ends the song with a heartrending cry which connects with the souls of all present.  Everyone is paying attention now. The stage is plunged into darkness.  The CROWD goes CRAZY!  Vanity applauds vigorously, wipes the tears from her eyes.  Morris, who was more affected by the performance than he'd care to admit, doesn't like what he sees and searches for a winning line-- MORRIS"

He twists wildly to the side of the road, kicking up dirt and debris, lurching him into the handlebars violently. The TRAIN ROARS abreast of him!  Prince snaps an angry look at the engineer. The Guy coolly gives him the finger and BLASTS the HORN violently. Prince becomes enraged!  He snaps a look to the speedometer: 65 mph.  He snaps a look to the Engineer -- the Guy sends him another obscene gesture and BLASTS his HORN. Prince grits his teeth, twists the throttle full.  He lurches forward in an instant, blazing in front of the train, The Engineer BLASTS the HORN mercilessly, and throws on the coals. They blast down the stretch neck to neck, twist round a wide bend. Prince edges in front!  The Engineer BLASTS the HORN and moves up.  Prince snaps a look to him -- the Guy mouths the words:  Fuck You! Prince wants to scream!  He twists the throttle, snaps a look to the speedometer:  75 mph.  He RIPS past ruts and gullies like a madman.  The TRAIN moves up.

He shoots a look to the Engineer -- the Guy is laughing hysterically now, BLASTING his HORN wildly, mouthing the words:  Bye Bye! Prince screams like  a MADMAN!  He twists his  throttle FULL!  He blazes ahead of the train, BLASTS! up the embankment, SAILS through the air... ...a BRICK WALL cuts the access road in two! He SCREAMS in bloody terror!  He hits the road and fishtails wildly, locking his brakes.  The WALL comes at him like a locomotive.  He's going to hit it, knows it and... He twists his throttle violently BLASTS! directly into the path of the train! The Engineer looks on in horror!  Prince throws his weight forward and... ...the train ROARS past him as he fishtails wildly to a stop. The Engineer sails off into the dusk, his mouth agape.

She bares her teeth angrily and he sucks at her mouth, biting and kissing her in a fever pitch. She kicks at him violently, hot tears streaming down her cheeks.  He jams his leg between hers, rubs it firmly against her bottom.  She struggles helplessly against him as he covers her breasts, her stomach, her thighs with his lips. Quick breaths escape from her -- her breathing begins to race... He snaps her panties in two, pulls them from between her legs.  She spreads herself as he releases his pants.  She squeezes his buttocks, pulls him toward her -- but Prince resists her coldly, regards her with contempt.  Suddenly he flips her onto her stomach, forces her to stand painfully on her knees.  He rubs his hand between her buttocks, then thrusts into her painfully, driving himself to the very depths of her... ...but she stifles a cry, arches her back, and meets his thrusts fiercely, moving quicker and quicker, banging her buttocks against his thighs again and again.  She's drawing from him now, turning the humiliation around, obtaining all that she needs and desires.  He's powerless -- her thrusts set the pace.  She rises, Prince still inside her and tugs on him rapidly, causing him to ejaculate suddenly, drawing from him a sharp and sudden cry...

He SEES musical notes written down on the paper. his heart pounding in his chest, he searches frantically through the rubble scattered about him.
