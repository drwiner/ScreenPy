They stand to shoot at him with t bows; the arrows WHISH toward the lens, fly past... The arrows tear through Wallace's clothes, but don't catc his flesh. He charges on; his horse LEAPS the barrier as  Wallace simultaneously swings the broadsword -- and he's  more than an expert: the tip, at the end of a huge arc, n breaks the sound barrier and the blade bites through the  corporal's helmet, taking off the upper half of his head! The soldiers try to rally, to shoot him in the back as hi horse leaps over them. One of them has sighted William's  back... But Hamish and his father crash into them! It's a wild fight; old Campbell takes an arrow through the shoul but keeps hacking with his sword; Hamish batters down two men -- and more Scots arrive! They overwhelm the soldiers"

William struggles up to meet him -- and comes face to face with Robert the Bruce. The shock and recognition stun Wallace; in that moment,  looking at Robert the Bruce's guilt-ridden face, he  understands everything: the betrayal, the hopelessness of Scotland.

He  batters at Wallace's sword, as if its use would give him  absolution."
