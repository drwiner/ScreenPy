Water pours into the canoe. Dogs bark, and no FIGURES are visible at the jetty. HOME GUARD. One of them has a sniper's rifle and is loading for a third shot. Inm can see him sighting the rifle. They lie flat in the cano ANOTHER GREAT FIST OF WOOD is gouged out. Now the boat is almost full of water. Veasey spits out a foul mouthful. I ROCKS THE CANOE AND LETS IT TURN OVER ONTO THEM, Veasey  surfaces from under it, clutching the wood as a raft, but the canoe CATCHES INMAN A BLOW TO HIS HEAD and he sinks.  Veasey hauls him to the surface and, surprisingly strong, holds him with one fist, the boat with the other, lets th current take them, pulling them under, then up, under, th up, but clinging on, as the rifle continues to deliver it assault, another shot into the boat, another into the wat near to Veasey's arm.
