The pool of golden light disintegrates into the thousands points which constitute it as we rapidly draw closer to t city. We are just above the tops of the highest buildings as we approach Hollywood Boulevard.  Below is neon and the icy thrust of search lights rotating on the corner of Hollywo and Vine. We continue west, then quickly north. There is the momentary appearance of the moonlit HOLLYWOO sign as we pass the blinking red beacon of the Capital Records building and drop into Franklin avenue and over t 101. Architectural remnants of Hollywood's past whip up.  We a heading east at treetop level.  A warm glow in the distan quickly grows into a modest commercial strip which includ cafes, bookstores, and a theater. We drop to eye level as we spy through the plate glass showcase window of the \"Bourgeois Pig\" coffeehouse, which holds the translucent reflection of the full moon. A cigarette wedged between knuckles smoulders.  MIKE take the last drag with great effort, then crushes it out.  He sits in the window sprawled across a red velvet couch tha once perfectly complemented a faux spanish foyer."

The bald guys all have facial hair and multiple pierced extremities with the odd neck-tattoo thrown in for good measure. Baggy denim and boots.  Pot leaves and Pumas.  Long, heav key chains.  Vintage 1994 whiteboy faux-gansta.  They do, however, look big and mean next to our boys. The early sixties style sweater jackets and blazers over button down shirts and tapered slacks don't quite have th same fear factor, but the boys do look classy. The word \"bitch\" is growled out by the two of them a half dozen more times until... Sue pulls a PISTOL out of his belt. Everyone is SCARED.  Especially the swingers."
