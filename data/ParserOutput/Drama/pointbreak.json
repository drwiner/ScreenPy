TRACKING SLOWLY IN on him as he lets it pour over his face. A HAND ENTERS FRAME, shutting off the water suddenly. TIGHT ON UTAH, his eyes opening. REVERSE, revealing RAZORHEAD and THREE OTHERS. They are powerfully built SURF-NAZIS. Scalps shaved on the sides.  Hair military short on top, lengthening into pigtails in the back.  Tattoos.  Wrist chains. TONE, ARCHBOLD and WARCHILD.  The one who socked Utah before is BUNKER.  They spread out flanking him."

He moves back on the board, trims out, slowing down. Maintains a fragile control. On pure adrenalized instinct, heart pounding, he falls in behind Bodhi, taking the same line along the roaring blac face. Bodhi is like the Silver Surfer, ahead of him in the moonlight. Not wanting to drop too far behind, Johnny walks a little forward on the board.  The nose dips, picking up speed. Johnny starts letting the speed work for him, learning that he can make long floating turns up and down the glassy face. Feeling the water under his feet, the tons of water pilin up behind him... feeling its awesome power and borrowing little of it. The Silver Surfer and the quarterback rocket through the night. Utah has a big feral grin plastered on his face. Bodhi looks back.  Gives him a thumbs up. Then he cuts left and drops giddily down to the bottom, slashing back and climbing. Utah tries it, feels the drop like freefall... feels the speed. He makes his bottom turn, nearly falling. The grin dropping off his face. He falls in behind Bodhi again as the wave wraps over the like a great black wing. TYLER, paddling back out, watches them shoot past her. Utah raises his arms above his head and HOWLS like a gonz wolf as they go by. She grins to herself, watching him. Knows he's gotten the ride that will make him a surfer fo life."

Then she knees him in the balls as he ricochets off the wall into her. She drives her elbow into his back as he drops. \"FREIGHT TRAIN\" lands knee-first on his gun hand, and viciously kicks the pistol away with one bloody foot.  It skitters under the bed. She's cut up from flying glass.  Demon-eyed and wired, he body lithe and muscular under white skin.  She sprints across the bedroom, leaving Utah slumped, heaving for breath. IN THE HALLWAY, Tone is hidden behind a doorway. White-knuckling the forty-five.  A wild-eyed kid with a big gun and not the slightest idea how to use it. He hears footsteps POUNDING behind him and spins. It's Warchild, running with the shot-gun."

Munoz sandwiches him with the door and draws down on Warchild, who dives into a doorway. Cole drives past Munoz, who has Tone pinned, and pounds down the corridor. Cole reaches the doorway and goes for the shot on Warchild. \"Freight-train\" appears behind him from another door. She raises a pair of scissors and drives them into his back up to the hilt. Pulls them out, going for another stab, when-- Pappas spins her around and slams her face-first into the wall. UTAH, in the bedroom, sees Warchild blur across his field of vision.

Warchild grabs Johnny as they scramble, and heaves him bodily toward the spinning blade.  Utah catches the rim o the mower with both hands, stopping himself inches from the rotor. Warchild puts all his weight on Johnny. Pushing him face-first toward the blades. Johnny feels the wind on his face. The engine is roaring, full throttle. PAPPAS APPEARS BEHIND THEM.

In SUSPENDED TIME we see them hooting and grinning at eac other as they cut aggressive moves close to each other. Dolphins playing. Challenging each other in mock combat. So good, their boards slash past each other with inches t spare. There is an incredible sense of freedom and exhilaration. Bonding forged through mastery of this arcane art. For the first time we see the core group of Bodhi's tribe by themselves.  It dawns on us... There are four of them. And at that moment Nathaniel drops in front of Bodhi, laughing at the near miss, and drops his pants in a nasty wig-wagging moon. TRACKING SLOWLY IN ON JOHNNY staring, mouth open. Watching the four horsemen of the Apocalypse ride toward him. IN SLOW MOTION, BODHI grins as he slashes past Nathaniel' shining white butt. ON JOHNNY, as he reacts to the dawning certainty. He feels weak, dizzy... like the ground is moving under him."

Utah's car starts to swap ends.  Hit the center island broadside. The sedan flips onto its back in an explosion of glass. SCREECH of steel on concrete as it comes to rest. Hanging upside down, Pappas is mightily pissed off."

Reagan grabs the gas nozzle out of the car. He pulls out a ZIPPO LIGHTER. Reagan raises the gas nozzle like a gun and holds the zippo below and slightly in front of it.  He flicks the flame. Then pulls the trigger on the nozzle. Like an impromptu flame thrower, the nozzle spews A TWENT FOOT JET OF FIRE which engulfs the T-Bird in an instant.

Broken field run through toys, swing set, stacks of god- knows-what. He runs through a Mr. Turtle Pool in an explosion of spray. Crashes through a hedge. Through the narrow gap between houses. Utah powers into the tight space behind him. Blurring along between stucco walls. They emerge into the front yard. A WOMAN watering her lawn is so surprised she yelps and falls down. Reagan and Utah both hurdle her. AHEAD, KIDS ON BIKES, racing along the sidewalk. Reagan dodges the first, Utah slams into the next two. He crashes, rolling, tangled up in bikes and squawking teenagers. He comes out of a pile-up somehow still in high gear. Reagan flashes across the sunlit street. Dodges in front of a GARBAGE TRUCK which locks up the brakes. It stops so fast, one of the guys falls off the back. The GUY is getting up as Utah whips around the back of th truck. Knocks him sprawling. Utah doesn't stop.  Doesn't look back. Like he doesn't see anything in the real world but the figure running ahead of him.  Like it's some kind of hyperkinetic video game. Everything is a blur.  Suburbia smeared into staccato impressions. The house across the street is blocked by fence on both sides. A MAN is picking up his mail. Reagan pounds past him.  Right through the front door of the house. Utah follows. Panting as he sprints down a dark hallway. A WOMAN with a basket of washing SCREAMS as Reagan blasts past her, knocking her flying. Utah leaps over her sprawled legs. Cats blur underfoot.  Utah crunches down on a tail.  A CA EXPLOSION.  Screeching merges with the woman's shrill shouts as Utah slams the back screen door off its hinges. Across the back yard.  Fence.  Over it.  Running on. REAGAN looks back. Sees Utah still behind him like in a bad dream. He enters the next house.  Sliding glass door. Utah sees Reagan pull it closed.  Locking it. Without breaking stride Johnny grabs a potted plant off a patio wall. Heaves it ahead of him. The glass BURST INTO A WALL OF DIAMONDS. Utah blasts through a microsecond later. Topples the kitchen table.  Furniture and crockery crashing everywhere. He sprints down a hallway after Reagan. A FIERCE WOMAN in a housecoat shouting at them as they pass, holding a vacuum cleaner like it's shot-gun."

TYLER stands above him, recovering from the kick of the smoking 9mm Beretta in her hand."

Hits and slides across the floor leaving a two-foot wide red smear. Echoes slap the walls.  Then all is still.  Plaintive whimpering and moaning.  The air is blue with smoke. Johnny is trying to catch his breath.  He rips his shirt open to see two deep indentations in the Second Chance vest.  Flattened .38 slugs caught in the Kevlar mesh.  Bu no blood. Bodhi drops over the counter near Utah. The two men look at each other. Bodhi's eyes seem lost.  He stares around at the carnage he has wrought, the bloody wreckage of his ego game.

Through the jungle of wings and fuselages we see Pappas get out of the car and start working his way among the aircraft. Utah slides behind the wheel and drives on. TIGHT ON TURBOPROP ENGINE roaring as it warms up. The same aircraft as before. Bodhi and Nathaniel are loading duffel bags into the open back door as the pilot completes his pre-flight checks. The Ex-President's suits have been removed, along with th body armor, and no guns are in sight.  Just a couple of guys getting ready for a charter flight.  Bodhi looks up and stops his work as... THE FBI SEDAN stops about 50 feet away. Nathaniel pulls a shotgun out of one of the duffels. Utah gets out.  He holds his hands out from his body and turns completely around.  Without his jacket on, it is evident that he is not carrying a gun. He walks forward."

There is no fear in his face, only awe as the mountain of water closes out, burying the Bodhisattva in whitewater grave... Pieces of broken surfboard explode upward, only to fall back into the raging whiteness and vanish. UTAH remains pensive, eyes fixed on the riderless surf. Tyler lowers her head.  A fragment of surfboard washes up onto wet sand.  The wind gathers force. Johnny finally turns to his woman, curls an arm around he shoulder, gathering her close.  Tears are streaming down her face as she stares at the sea."
