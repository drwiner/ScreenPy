At that time, I had him author all the scripts and stories that I wrote. I came up with a standard biography to fill the back flap of his books. He had been a sailor, an industrial spy, the doorman at a Parisian cabaret, a boxer, a waiter and an advertisement hand-double. A self-made man, active and attractive like an English spy, vital, skeptical and sarcastic. For many years, Mateo Blanco and Harry Caine shared the same person, me, but a time came when, all of a sudden, I couldn't be anyone other than Harry Caine. I became my pseudonym. (He applies lotion in front of the mirror, we first see him in front of it, and then, doubled, reflected in it. Then, suddenly, the mirror does not reflect him. Of his two identities he only has one left). Just as I had planned, a heterodox writer and, never better stated, a self-made man, one might even say, \"self-written man\".
