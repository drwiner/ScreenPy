Workin for redneck nobody named McGuthrie. Had no money, no staff, no fuckin office. Everyone thought we didn't stand a chance. There's no way we can compete. And about this time, a guy running a congressional campaign a few districts over gives me a call. Says, \"I really like what you were able to do for poor ole' Sam. But let's face it, he's a goner, so why don't you come work for me?\" What do I do? Well Stephen -this is where you and I are different. I told Sam about the call. And Sam says to me, \"Paul, you think this other's guy's got a shot at winning, and he can pay you more than anything I can afford, so if it's what you feel you need to do, then I won't get in your way.\" So I say, \"Sam -you took a chance and hired me when I was even more of nobody than you are, and I'd be damned if I'm gonna jump ship just because the shit hit the fan.\" We lost the race, but three years later, when Sam decided to run for Governor -who do you think he called? We won that race."
