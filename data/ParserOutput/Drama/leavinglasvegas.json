He is a good-looking man  but is clearly in trouble of some kind. Although still  in control of his faculties, it becomes clear in the  following scene that he is much the worse for wear with  drink. He looks around the room until he sees someone he recognizes and then walks over to a table where two coupl are seated. The men are young execs, the girls, both blon and busty, have very white teeth and smile all of the tim The camera follows Ben over to the table. One of the exec looks up as Ben gets close. He recognizes him but delays  his recognition until the last moment in the hope that Be is not looking at him."

There were three or four  small naked children playing  on the floor and we had to  step over them to get into  the room. The room had a bed  and a dresser. He lay on his  back on the bed and I put a  rubber on him and sucked him  for a while until he was hard  and then I eased on to him.  About twenty minutes later  there was a knock on the door  and it was the woman saying  our time was up. I felt kind  of guilty because he hadn't  come and I offered to reason  with the woman and get  another ten minutes, but he  said it was all right and  began dressing. When we were  ready to leave the room he  stopped me and... hugged me  and kissed me on the cheek.  He gave me an extra hundred  as a tip and went back to his  car. I remember being  relieved that I wouldn't have  to work again that evening."
