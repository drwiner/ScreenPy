Watson spins off several of the girls, grabs another group. His ex-partners wind up close to Rogozhin. He whispers something to them. Their eyes widen, and they stare at Watson with disbelief. Watson again switches partners, and the first girls now whisper intensely to those who just left the floor. The same reaction. Watson, oblivious to all this, is whirling around with another set of girls. By now some of the girls who are in on the secret are whispering to the male dancers in tights. Their reaction is slightly different. They are seeing Watson in a new light. And before Watson knows what's happening, he has been abandoned by all the girls, and is joined first by one pair then another pair of male dancers, till he is dancing only with gay guys in tights. It gradually dawns on Watson that there is something wrong with this state of affairs. After some difficulty, he breaks away from them."

Prominently lettered on the bow is the name H.M.S. JONAH, and suspended by a rope from the prow is the magnum of champagne which Holmes delivered. Along the sides are torpedo tubes, and fitted over the conning tower is the head and neck of the \"monster\" we saw in the lake. Present are half a dozen naval personnel, commanded by an officer. As the royal party comes down the spiral staircase, the officer snaps to attention. Mycroft is in the lead, followed by the Queen, Holmes, the lady-in- waiting, the equerry and the scientists."
