ZIAT - CLOSE in terror; throat cords rippling; eyes bulgi with disbelief, body quivering, mouth open and screaming, but it is a SILENT SCREAM and the mouth is a dark hole  filled with blood and without a TONGUE. BILLY, without a moment's mercy, crashes his fist into  ZIAT'S face. ZIAT his strength now broken, collapses on his back. BILLY crashes his fist again into the hated face.

STEAM - a glint of a FACE coming through.  HAMIDOU - his  eyes so intense they seem to burn off the steam like sun  cutting haze. Then disappear again. BILLY pulls back. A pause. Silence. Cat and mouse.  Then  very suddenly: A HAND reaches out of the STEAM and GRABS BILLY by the  hair.  A GRUNT, OFF. BILLY his eyes moving fast. A FLASH of a huge darkened penis, fully erect cutting  forward into the steam like a from drill, detached from  the rest of the body. A SOUND - grotesque and so sudden after the silence it  jars the senses. A BLURRED VISUAL then:   BILLY Launching forward in SLOW MOTION, desperation  distorting his features and:  STEAM - then BILLY'S HEAD SLAMS through it in SLOW MOTION and: SMASHES the penis with its skull. A horrifying GASP. BLURRED VISUALS - STEAM - HAMIDOU staggering CLOSE -  surprise, pain... BILLY MOVING. A FOOT coming up fast through the steam, connecting again with the genitals. Another SCREAM. A BODY hitting the tiles. BILLY groping for the falaka stick. Raises it.  A STRUGGLE - Two bodies thrashing, one of them screaming  now in pain. A definitive sound then a THWACK! Another  thwack!  The steam seems to clear and BILLY is on top of the gigantic HAMIDOU smashing him with the falaka stick with all his might.  HAMIDOU is in contortions, his nose busted and bleeding. His HAND gripping BILLY by the neck, forcing him back and strangling him at the same time. Billy is red in the face such is the force of this creature but continues to beat  him, harder, harder.  His expression filled with a life  energy, seeded in hatred, that he thought he had lost.   Again, Again -"

Curiosity.  Recognition. Shock. Love. And then they move. But we don't hear their movements. It is SOUNDLESS reunion; the SISTER running out first in SLO MOTION, the MOTHER following last, crying; the GRANDMOTHE too infirm to move, the shaking her head from side to sid in SLOW MOTION, her tears lost somewhere in the wrinkles  of her face.  BILLY surrounded by FAMILY - SLOW MOTION - SOUNDLESS.  Hi eyes flooding. All the feelings in him.  And deep inside a solitary question.  "
