He was a widower, and I was his only  child. He was not an especially  religious man, a sober Methodist.  One evening, seven years ago, he  attended a Pentecostal meeting in  the commons rooms at Harvard and  suddenly found himself speaking in  tongues. (she takes her drink  and crosses to the  sofa) That is to say, he suddenly sank to  his knees at the back of the room  and began to talk fluently in a  language which no one had ever heard  before. This sort of thing happens  frequently at Pentecostal meetings,  and they began to happen regularly  to my father. (she sits) It was not unusual to walk into our  home and find my father sitting in  his office, utterly serene and happily  speaking to the air in this strange  foreign tongue. I was, at that time  twenty years old and having my  obligatory affair with a minority  group, in my case a Hopi Indian, a  post-graduate fellow at Harvard doing  his doctorate in the aboriginal  languages of the Southwest. One day,  I brought the Indian boy home just  as my father was sinking to his knees  in the entrance foyer in one of his  trances. The Indian wheeled in his  tracks and said, \"Well, I'll be a  sonofabitch.\" You see, my father was  speaking an Apache dialect, an obscure  dialect at that, spoken only by a  ragged band of unreconstructed Indians  who had rejected the reservation and  were living in total isolation in  the Sierra Madre Mountains of northern  Mexico. Well! What do you say to  that, Dr. Bock?"

I mean, here was living  afflatus right before my eyes! Within  a week, my father had closed his  Beacon Hill practice and set out to  start a mission in the Mexican  mountains. And I turned in my S.D.S.  card and my crash helmet and followed  him. It was a disaster, at least for  me. My father had received the  revelation, not I. He stood gaunt on  a mountain slope and preached the  apocalypse to solemnly amused Indians.  I masturbated a great deal. We lived  in a grass wickiup and ate raw rabbit  and crushed pinon nuts. It was  hideous. Within two months, I was  back in Boston, a hollow shell and  dizzy with dengue, disenchanted with  everything. I turned to austerity,  combed my hair tight and entered  nursing school. I became haggard,  driven and had shamelessly incestuous  dreams about my father. I took up  with some of the senior staff at the  hospital. One of them, a portly  psychiatrist, explained I was  generated by an unresolved lust for  my father. I apparently cracked up.  One day, they found me walking to  work naked and screaming obscenities.  There was talk of institutionalizing  me, so I packed a bag and went back  to my father in the Sierra Madre  Mountains. I've been there ever since.  That's three years. My father is, of  course, mad as a hatter. I watch  over him and have been curiously  content. You see, Doctor, I believe  in everything."

Two hours ago,  walking out of a coffee shop on Fifty- Seventh Street and Second Avenue,  eight o'clock in the morning, broad  daylight, I got mugged. A sixteen- year-old girl walks up to me, shows  me a knife about a yard long and  says, \"Give me your wallet.\" I thought  she was kidding. I mean there's  hundreds of people walking right by.  Well, she wasn't kidding. \"Listen,\"  I said, \"all I got's about twenty  bucks.\" So she takes the wallet  anyway. So I said, \"How about leaving  me my identification?\" I mean, I had  my driver's license, my Diner's Club,  my credit cards. But she took them  all, the whole damn wallet, credit  cards, everything. So I stopped some  guy, I said, \"Hey, you see that girl  there, walking away?\" He says, \"Yeah.\"  I said, \"She just stole my wallet,  credit cards and everything.\" He  says, \"Well, that's what they want,  the credit cards.\" So I started  looking for a cop. I mean, go find a  cop, right? Well, I finally find a  cop. The girl's halfway to South  America by now, probably bought the  ticket with my credit cards. So the  cop says, \"What's your name?\" And  you want to know something? I couldn't  think of my name. The girl took all  my identification, you know what I  mean? She took all my credit cards.  So I said, \"You know this is screwy.  I can't think of my name.\" So he  took me to the station house. The  sergeant says, \"What's your name?\" I  said, \"I don't know! She took all my  credit cards!\" So they took me down  here. So what do you think, Doctor?  I'm nuts, right? I finally flipped."
