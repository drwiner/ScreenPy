As we watch him draw we can tell he is capable of great concentration. And patient. With eyes that miss nothing: He has pilot's eyes. We'll find out more about him as time goes on, but this is all you really have to know: Luther Whitney is the hero of this piece. As we watch him draw -- Luther's sketchbook. He is finishing his work on the eyes, and he's caught the sadness: It's good stuff. Luther. It's not good enough for him.        He looks at work a moment, shakes his head."
