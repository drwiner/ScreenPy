Some, from the Asian territories, still ear something of their national  costume. Included among them are groups of foreigners from recently occupied countries and a Babel of languages drifts through the fetid air. It's a wide ranging mix of types, of race, of class. They're miserable, starving and ill. There is no camp camaraderie and they eye each other with indifference or suspicion. Most of these men are political prisoners, known as 'Politicals' or 'S8ers', after the section of the Soviet Penal Code that has put them here. Near the stove, and contrasted with the 'Politicals', a group are gathered about a card game on a lower bunk. These men look healthier, and are further distinguished by their tattoos."

From  the high windows, hands can be seen clutching the bars. From inside a communal groaning and sighing. Voices,  female voices, cry out for water, and on the agonized  faces of the fugitives a mixture of pain and empathy. Then the train seems to sigh, like a great beast, and from beneath the carriages flow streams of blood and urine. As the distant light turns green the train slowly  moves forward, and as it does so, letters and notes drop to the tracks from the barred windows. After it is gone they scramble over the tracks into the  woods on the other side, all but VOSS. He is picking up  as many of the notes and letters as he can."

It is with a backdrop of this luxuriant green that Indian faces look up toward the slopes. Here they watch three wild looking bearded men descending toward them. The additional cost of this final leg of their journey is plainly visible on their faces, and in their slow stumbling movements. They walk like automatons, only their senses fully alive. Shouts from the locals produce a village ELDER, then a POLICEMAN. Older children squeal with delight, while some of the very young cry out in fear, one even bursting into tears - are these the dreaded Yeti their grandfathers told them lived up in the mountain peaks?"
