Both men are desperately worried: the Valet is  thin and middle-aged; the Cook, plump and Italian. It is  very cold. They wear shawls over their night-dresses and  clogs on their feet. They wheeze as they climb. The candl throw their shadows up onto the peeling walls of the hous which is evidently an old one and in bad decay.

The  next I was here, in Vienna, city of  musicians, sixteen years old and  studying under Gluck! Gluck, Father.  Do you know who he was? The greatest  composer of his time. And he loved  me! That was the wonder. He taught  me everything he knew. And when I  was ready, introduced me personally  to the Emperor! Emperor Joseph - the  musical king!  Within a few years I  was his court composer. Wasn't that  incredible? Imperial Composer to His  Majesty! Actually the man had no ear  at all, but what did it matter? He  adored my music, that was enough.  Night after night I sat right next  to the Emperor of Austria, playing  duets with him, correcting the royal  sight-reading. Tell me, if you had  been me, wouldn't you have thought  God had accepted your vow? And believe  me, I honoured it. I was a model of  virtue. I kept my hands off women,  worked hours every day teaching  students, many of them for free,  sitting on endless committees to  help poor musicians - work and work  and work, that was all my life.
