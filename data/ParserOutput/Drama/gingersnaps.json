A semi appears on the horizon, coming her way. Brigitte lifts he thumb. The semi's turn indicator comes on as it slows and veers arrive before her. ROLL TAIL CREDITS as: Excerpts from an episode of the television program UNSOLV MYSTERIES roll. It tells the story of the mysterious disappearance of two teenage girls - sisters - who disappeared under strange circumstances in the normally q suburb of Bailey Downs. Brigitte and Ginger LOOK-A-LIKES re-enact the summarized events of their flight from justice. The cops figured out their faked deaths, of course.. Henry and Pamela have reportedly denied comment. It is seen from the community' perspective as two delusional young women gone totally wr a grotesque tragedy of youth wasted by mental illness. No can explain though the non-human blood trails leaving the scene of their last crime... At the segment's close and the credits roll. out, we see traditional high school photos of Brigitte and Ginger."
