SANDY I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown.  There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on,  but I think there are some people who were  brought in for questioning on a murder case  that could have something to do with the ear.  I heard some of the same names. JEFFREY Do you know who was brought in for  questioning? SANDY There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the          field where you found the ear. There's  also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others. JEFFREY Were all these people questioned this afternoon? SANDY No. this has been going on for some time . several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body. only parts. JEFFREY The ear is from a missing person maybe? SANDY Maybe so. JEFFREY It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in? SANDY Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a  couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her. JEFFREY I guess you have to get back home soon? SANDY Not really, why? (then she understands) You want to see the building?. Come on, I'll show you."

SANDY (thinking and intrigued, plus she  is beginning to like Jeffrey) It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.

JEFFREY Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a  few minutes you will knock on her door,  drawing her attention away from me and I  will then jimmy a window. SANDY What will I say when she comes to the door? JEFFREY You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a  few \"Awake\" magazines for you. You don't  have to keep her very long. a few seconds  is all I'll need. Whatiya think? SANDY I don't know. it sounds like a good  daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous. JEFFREY Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest.

I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named  Frank who has now cut off both of Don's  ears. I think he is holding them to make  her do things for him. I think she wants  to die. the ears were for her a warning  to stay alive. there is another man  involved. I call him the \"yellow man\". you saw his back the other day in the hall  at her door. I don't know what he does but  I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank.  Frank is a very dangerous man. SANDY (quietly) Wow. Should you tell my father? JEFFREY I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble. SANDY You saw a lot in one night. JEFFREY . Actually. I've been in twice. SANDY (uneasy) Twice. without her sensing anything? JEFFREY (lying) Yes. SANDY (pausing) Did you see her undressed? JEFFREY Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know. SANDY Yeah? JEFFREY (a searching, slight smile) That doesn't bother you, does it? SANDY Who, me? Why should it? JEFFREY (seeing some jealousy and  and happy for it) That's what I thought. SANDY You're sure right. It is a strange world. JEFFREY Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.? SANDY I don't know. I had a dream. in fact. the night I met you. (she reflects silently on  this before proceeding) . in the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. you know, birds. robins stood for love. and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess. until the robins come there is trouble. JEFFREY Yeah I guess so. (he turns to her) You're a neat girl. SANDY So are you. (laughs) I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
