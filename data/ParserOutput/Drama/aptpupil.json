Like hers, she said, wasn't teaching, but  collecting nineteenth-century postcards.  I guess there's no money in that, so she has to  be a teacher.  Anyway, she told us to start thinking about it.  So I did, but nothing happened.  Until the following summer, in  Ronny Pegler's garage.  That's where I found it."

We could just crowd them in and pull a gas torch up to each of the windows.  But with so many of them, we couldn't be sure the bodies would burn properly.  We needed something ...certain.  Then a young, bright soldier, I shall never forget his enthusiastic smile, pointed to a pair of bulldozers near the Western gate which had been used during construction.  How perfectly simple it was. The bulldozers carved a narrow trench, four meters deep, down the center of the camp. For two hours they dug until I realized we may not have enough gas to finish the job. So the inmates were given shovels and told they were building a shelter from the incoming artillery.  When they were done, I immediately called for a practice drill and three thousand naked bodies began to march into the trench.  It took less than twenty minutes to get them in place.  Quickly the bulldozers moved down the sides of the pit sending the piles of earth into the massive grave.  Those who tried to free themselves were shot, of course, but very few cartridges were wasted that day.  The machines were too fast.  Back and forth they went... packing the dirt.  One by one the tractors ran out of gas and my men had to scurry along with shovels.  But by sunset... it was done.  I gave the order to evacuate.  In the distance the plumes of Russian mortar fire rose like an approaching thundercloud.  But I knew that no matter what happened, ...no one would ever forget what we did here. Dussander stares into the fire.  Todd, wide-eyed, is lock Dussander when... The PHONE RINGS. They look at each other, a bit puzzled.

Such a problem can often be solved by a frank and open discussion.  I am ready to work out a  time for us to meet.  In a case such as this, earlier is usually better.

In the distance, the faint, but rising wail of sirens.   A front door or two slams shut as Todd passes.  Suddenly up between two houses.  A man standing in his back yard s Todd and freezes.  Todd ignores him.  He steers the bike the yard and picks up the dirt path he has used so many t before."
