There are chains - dozens of them - disappearing with the darkness of the ceiling: all are swinging back and forth.  Some end in hooks, with pieces of skin and sinew adhering; some are serrated, others simply drip blood. The bell tolls on. On the blood-spattered floor, a box, some six inches square, which resembles an elaborate Chinese puzzle box.  Later, we'll learn its name and function. It's called the Lament Configuration, and it's a way to raise Hell.  LITERALLY. For now, it remains an enigma. A hand, its flesh systematically pierced with needles, reaches down and picks the box up. In close up we see just what an elaborate construction it is, made up of sliding panels and mysterious chambers.  It is open at present, its polished innards exposed.  Out of it, a banal melody, played on a hidden mechanism.  The hands, which belong to one of the demons - a CENOBITE - move over the box."

The room is getting darker.  The chains are disappearing into the gloom. We see tantalizing glimpses of other figures, turning from the light and fading into the darkness.  We catch sight of monstrous faces, but only for the briefest of moments.  Then they're gone. The box is almost returned to its unopened condition. The last sounds to fade are the tune from the box, and the bell. It tolls on as the final panel of the box is slid into place. The light stops swinging. The panel clicks.  The tune stops. At last, a long shot of the room.  At the far end the window is covered with yellowed newspapers.  There is dust settling through the air. Otherwise it is empty. The bell fades. It's as if nothing ever happened here. Except ... Somewhere, very quietly, a creaking that could be the sound of floorboards, or the low, agonized gasp of a thing barely alive."

The room has been spruced up for the party.  Candles are burning on tables and mantelpiece, there are pictures on the walls.  But this is essentially cosmetic.  The place has not been refurnished or re- decorated. We move to the party guests.  Two, we recognize: KIRSTY, and LARRY - who is presently entertaining the gathering with an account of his accident.  The others are new faces.  An American couple:  BILL UNDERWOOD and his wife EVELYN, who are of an age with LARRY, and a younger, bespectacled man - a work colleague of LARRY's - STEVE O'DONNELL.  All are drunk. A brandy bottle sits on the table between them, and half a dozen other liquer bottles besides.  STEVE, it soon becomes apparent, has his eyes on KIRSTY. LARRY is half-way through his hospital story, gesticulating wildly as he goes through the tale, much to the pleasure of the rest.  His hand and lower arm are heavily bandaged."

FRANK's head is thrown back, and he screams. She slips from beneath his grasp.  But he's after her in a moment, his hand catching her blouse.  It tears.  His fingers rake her bare skin. She stumbles, reaches out for the wall, which is slick with SYKES' blood.  Her hand slides over it.  She falls, heavily. Roaring, FRANK comes in pursuit of her. On the floor in front of KIRSTY:  the box.  It's a poor weapon, but it's all she's got.  As he comes after her again, she stands up and delivers a blow to his head with the box.  He howls.  She races for the door.  But he's after her.  He strikes her. She's thrown against the wall.  He's FURIOUS now. Strikes her again.  She cannot survive much more. She raises the box to retaliate.

Once, she glances back towards the Hospital Room, to reassure herself that it's still there.  It is, though it's no more than a sliver of light at the far end of the passageway. She advances a few more paces.  The atmosphere is growing denser; smoke thickens the air. Then, a light glows at the other end of the corridor. The sound of the sobbing child ceases. She stops walking. Ahead, the smoke clears and the light brightens, and we see a creature - THE ENGINEER - hanging in the space between the walls.  It is in silhouette against the light, but we can see enough to know that it resembles no earthly animal.  Its vast black limbs hold it suspended above the corridor, clinging to the stone. Its front limbs, vestigial by comparison, hang down from beneath its vast head.  Its tail is curled over its back. KIRSTY's expression registers this horror.  THE ENGINEER moves into the light.  Its irises narrow to slits. From the tail a vast sting, oozing pus - like venom, glides into view. And then - - it comes at her, advancing along the corridor by bracing its legs against the walls.  Its breath is a growl in its belly, until it moves into darkness, when all sound from it ceases, only to erupt  again as it finds the light. KIRSTY turns, and starts to run. It comes after her at speed.   Darkness, light, darkness, light; roars and silence - Its jaws spill its thick saliva; its eyes gleam. KIRSTY runs blindly down the corridor, back towards the safety of the Hospital Room.   But it's very close on her heels, lingering - As she comes within a few yards of the Room it closes on her."

Standing across the room from her, lit by a strange phosphorescence that has no visible source, are four extraordinary figures. They are CENOBITES.   Each of them is horribly mutilated by systems of hooks and pins.  The garments they wear are elaborately constructed to marry with their flesh, laced through skin in places, hooked into bone. The leader of this quartet has pins driven into his head at inch intervals.  At his side, a woman whose neck is pinned open like a vivisection specimen.  Accompanying them is a creature whose mouth is wired into a gaping rectangle - the exposed teeth sharpened to points, and a fat sweating monster whose eyes are covered by dark glasses. When the lead CENOBITE speaks, we recognise the voice as that of the creature from the beginning of the film. KIRSTY stares in amazement."
