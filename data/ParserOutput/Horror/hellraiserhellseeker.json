Trevor falls to the ground, arms and legs thrashing, heav up mouthfuls of water. Trevor is drowning... BONG... BONG... BONG... In the puddles of water, we see bits of debris: leaves, pebbles, etc. Finally, a hideous eel-like creature's head pokes out of Trevor's gaping mouth- it escapes and slithe across the floor, up the window sill and out into the nig -the ringing bell stops abruptly and he takes in a humong lungful of sweet oxygen.
