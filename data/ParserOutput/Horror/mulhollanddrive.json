Well, you'll sleep good tonight ... Hudson Bay sounds beautiful ...oh well, I hope you packed your coat. (laughs). You mean the audition...Wally Brown... she didn't mention it but he'll fax the dialogue to Coco? Suddenly I'm so nervous ... okay Aunt Ruth... I'll try. I'll study those lines until I know them inside out. Yes, either right here on this fabulous leather couch or I'll take them with a coffee in the courtyard like a regular movie star. (laughs). Oh! I got a real shock to find your friend Rita here. She was in the shower and I opened the door ... Rita ... what do you mean? She was in an accident ... your friend Rita. No, Coco unlocked the door. No, she didn't see her. She's sleeping. No... she's very nice. I'm sure there's some explanation, Aunt Ruth... I don't think we have to do that. Please don't worry. I'll take care of it. No, I'll let you know. Where can I ... okay I'll get it from Coco. No, please don't worry... thank you so much for letting me stay here. You've made me so happy... thank you, thank you. Please don't worry... Aunt Ruth we don't need the police. I'll call you when you get to Hudson Bay. Please... please ... Goodbye Aunt Ruth. Betty slowly and quietly hangs up the phone.

Behind her are three back-up male vocalists dressed in three tone, shiny 60's suits. We hear strings soar up and the blonde girl begins to sing SIXTEEN REASONS by Connie Stevens. The mal vocalists backing her up flawlessly. We move back and realize we are on a movie set inside a s stage. A screen test is being shot of the girl and as we continue moving back we see the director Adam Kesher surrounded by his crew. Behind them there are many people standing, eating, watching, working. The stage is full an bustling. The song plays loudly over. Sarah and Nicki bri Betty into this scene through a giant stage door. A guard mimes for them to be quiet as they approach the set. The song continues to play over. As Sarah leads Betty up close Adam turns and his eyes fal the beautiful face of Betty Elms. Sensing something Betty turns and sees Adam. They each seem to feel the thrill of the thunderbolt, but each embarrassed to stare longer tha they already have turn back and watch the girl finish the song.
