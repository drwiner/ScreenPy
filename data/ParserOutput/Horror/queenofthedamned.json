A glittering torrent of notes fly out of his violin as if made of gold. Unconsciously, Lestat steps closer to the music, into firelight. The Father and his daughter become less certain, as they gaze at Lestat's strange, pale, glowing skin, the luminous shine of eyes. But Lestat is completely taken by the music, the moment.

There is an open foyer area leading to two great wooden doors, held firm by a tree-sized carved wooden bolt that bars the doors shut from the outside. Suddenly, the BOLT flies up and SPLINTERS with a SHRIEKING CRACK. The doors fly open revealing a bright light from within... Lestat, apprehensive, continues towards the open doorway."

Slowly, her eyelids pull back to reveal pale green eyes. Lestat stares in amazement... Her arm rises up, her wrist extended outward towards Lestat. The pulse of a HEARTBEAT begins... Lestat moves toward her as if beckoned. A green vein appears beneath the marble surface of her skin. The vein pulses as the blood courses around. The HEARTBEAT POUNDS LOUDER, DEEPER.

Jesse is about to speak when Lestat raises his finger to her lips and then points at... A couple of lovers moving across the meadow. They sit on a park bench. The woman giggles drunkenly. Jesse watches and gasps as she realizes the male lover is a vampire. Lestat moves forward. Jesse gingerly follows. Taking his lover in his arms the vampire begins to bite her neck... Lestat looks over at Jesse who watches, fascinated and disturbed. The vampire senses another's presence -- stops and turns to reveal his vampire eyes shining in the dark. Lestat steps into the halo of a street lamp and hisses. Sensing Lestat's power, the vampire hisses and instantly -- the vampire is gone. Jesse turns to Lestat but he has disappeared, too. Spinning around again she sees... Lestat hovering over the mortal woman who is still in a swoon. Checking to see that the vampire is gone, Jesse moves closer to the bench."
