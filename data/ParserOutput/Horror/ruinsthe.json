ERIC sits in the chair beside her, studying the Cliff Not for The Canterbury Tales. He's leanly muscular, with dark curly hair. Other Cliff Notes lie scattered beneath his chair: Antigone, A Separate Peace, Hea rt of Darkness, 19 JEFF and STACY sit on the far side of the cooler; they're playing gin.

A second tendril emerges from the low wall of green aroun the clearing, then a third. They move rapidly, as if raci each other; both of them slipping alongside the first int the little pool of vomit.

He glances at the others, but once again no one responds. They all look dazed: knocked back into themselves. Jeff picks up the knife, wipes it on his jeans. JEFF (cont'd) They must've done the same thing with the archaeologists. And Henrich. Trapped them here. Like us. He cuts the sandwich into four equal sections. JEFF (cont'd) And then somehow it killed them off. All of them. one by one. This is too much for Eric; he.leaps up, looking panicky. 82."

They're lying in the dirt at the base of the backboard, t bloodstained bones held together with a few remaining cor of flesh. A vine has come snaking into the clearing: it's wrapping itself around one of the feet. As the tendril begins to drag. the bones away, a.second o slithers forward and lays claim to the other foot. Eric grabs the knife, jumps up, steps on the first tendri bends to slash at it with the blade. He swoops toward the second one. Even as he does so, though, a third tendril slithers into the clearing, then a fourth. Stacy SCREAMS again, short and loud, and backs toward the tent; Eric bends and slashes, bends and slashes, and the' keeps coming, from all directions, reaching for the bones"

It was impossible to make any sense of what she was saying. She was sobbing, hysterical. We had to sedate her.

DOCTOR (cont'd) Her clothes were torn; she was covered in blood. But not her own. 135. Teresa stares down at the photo: it shows Amy on a gurney unconscious, blood-smeared, corpse-like."
