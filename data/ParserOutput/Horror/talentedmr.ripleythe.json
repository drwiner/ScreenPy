The boat is rocking and swerving crazily as Dickie falls against the tiller. Ripley almost loses his balance. His glasses come off. They struggle, locked together in a life or death wrestle to get control of the oar. Dickie's blinded by hi own blood, loses his grip. Ripley, terrified, hits Dickie again and again, the oar l a carpet-beater banging down flat, blood on the blade, bl on Ripley, until he's on his knees, heaving for breath, letting his arm drop, then realizing, disgusted, that he' let it rest in a pool of blood. He starts to sob, sprawls there, sobbing, next to Dickie, horrified by what he's do Nobody's in sight.  The boat rocks, gently, the sun spark indifferently on the waves.  Ripley lies by Dickie in the bottom of the boat, in the embrace he's always wanted. The pretty blue-and-white boat rocks peacefully.  The sea calms. EXT. A COVE NEAR SAN REMO. AFTERNOON. A deserted cove, several miles along the coast. Ripley clambers onto a rock over the shore.  He's watching the b slowly sinking. Shuddering from the exertion, the cold, h finds Dickie's jacket, puts it on and watches as the boat disappears under the surface. EXT. SAN REMO. DUSK. Ripley walks back towards the hotel, still wearing Dickie jacket, cold and wet, his bag over his shoulder. INT. HOTEL LOBBY. EARLY EVENING. Ripley approaches the front desk.  He's shivering.  He's wearing his glasses."

He has placed one shirt on the Ripley pile then checks again, and - on seei Dickie's initials, places it with the bigger pile, then p it up again and holds it briefly against his cheek. He takes Dickie's rings, opens up a LITTLE BOX of buttons needles and cufflinks and sadly tosses them in.
