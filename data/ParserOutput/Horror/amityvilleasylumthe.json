The tribe had fled Salem in Massachusetts to escape persecution by the Christians who were persecuting members of the tribe because of their Witchcraft practices. These practices included a ritualistic human sacrifice of six people (The significance of Six being related to the biblical number of man and creation) in order to induce the spirit of their God, The Dark Master, who they believed manifested his powers through his devoted followers, giving them immortality. The hundred strong tribe settled in Amityville but were later chased off the land by local Christians. Satchem accused the Christians of not properly compensating his tribe for the land. A war started and the Christians hired a hunter called John Underhill from Salem. At the site where One Twelve Oceans Avenue was later built in Amityville, Underhill killed all of the tribe. The Indians were buried in a mass grave on the site. Before he died Satchem vowed revenge. According to local legend, Chief Satchem is believed to have subsequently haunted the land. Various parapsychologists and mediums have 65. claimed that Satchem's vengeful spirit influenced the 1974 DeFeo murders at One Twelve Oceans Avenue and the haunting of the subsequent owners. Although such assertions are widely disputed. LISA"

I always say that all forms of media, whether it be books, newspapers, TV or movies, are a preservation of life. Our physical bodies may die but our images live on when we are famous. Our work and our passion is preserved, therefore it's as if our souls are preserved. Through all of these forms of media we are, in effect, immortal.
