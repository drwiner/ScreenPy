The carton asks \"Have You Seen Me?\" above a photogr face that's been obscured by grime. Yellowing newspaper, old Coke cans, Twinkie wrappers... i that bed of untended weeds. A hollow Texas wind blows thr it all. We stay with the carton... Then that hollow wind gains speed... and a deep RUMBLE gr in the distance, becoming a ROAR. The yellowed newspaper off and whips past us. ...as an 18-WHEEL MACK TRUCK blows by, just a blur in the corner of our frame, doing 75 in the pre-dawn darkness. Then, the truck is gone, and the rush of air dissipates. milk carton, the coke cans... they lie undisturbed. A LIGHT RAIN begins to fall... and some of the grime wash away from that milk carton, revealing a face. A child. \"H You Seen Me?\" It's heartbreaking. TILT UP... to take in the vast flatness of Texas' I-35: concrete forever.

No. Less a second... by a glimpse of that SHATTERED MIRROR - his o twisted image. He looks away from it, refusing to be distracted, determi to kill this guy. ...then those eyes drift back to the mirror again. ...and he sees his reflection: a hardened, crazed strange animal.
