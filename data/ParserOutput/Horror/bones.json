Bones' face shifts, cracking, one second the hungry ghost The next, he's the old Bones who once ruled this 'hood. He sees, down the block, the old palmistry sign.  It's Pearl's place.  For a second, the face of the real Jimmy Bones triumphs and he smiles.  Then hears voices behind h Stank and Weaze.  They see a tall, thin figure in some ve fine looking, long duster."
