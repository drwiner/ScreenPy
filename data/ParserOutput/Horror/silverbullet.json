In his workroom, we see MAC spilling boron over the medal and looking closely at the stain. JANE (v-o continues) The gunsmith confirmed the high-grade silver content of my crucifix and Marty's medallion... d.) In a dim shot which makes MAC look more like a sorcer than ever, we see him light an acetylene torch and begin melting the medal and the crucifix in the crucible.
