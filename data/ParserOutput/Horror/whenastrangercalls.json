Jill hangs up and thinks for another moment, apprehension creeping over her face. Then, in the darkness of the bedroom, she begins to hear muttering of a man's voice, low and deep. It is Duncan in the throes of Guy du Marraux. Jill freezes. As the voice gets steadily louder and more  menacing, her attention focuses on the door to the bedroo closet which is a couple of inches ajar."

Jill screams again. It is the despe sound of a woman facing certain death. Suddenly, two quick shots ring out, overwhelming all othe sound. Duncan falls back with a groan and a thud. Out of the darkness of the hallway steps Clifford, pistol hand. He crosses to Duncan. He is dead. Then Clifford wal around the room to the far side of the bed and looks down On the narrow strip of floor between the bed and the wall lies John. Clifford nudges the body with his foot.
