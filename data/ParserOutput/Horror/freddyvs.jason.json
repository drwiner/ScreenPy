Freddy laughs and kicks the nightmaremobile into overdrive, ROARING OFF and disappearing with an EXPLOSION of FIRE that wisps away in an instant. In the distance -- an old farmhouse.  The lights go on inside. The passenger door opens and Meagan falls out onto the ground, bleeding from a slight scalp wound.  A rear door opens and Stormie and Erwin spill out, locked in embrace and not seriously hurt.  Meagan staggers around to the driver's side and opens the door.  Jesse is laying unconscious against the steering wheel. Meagan pulls him off the wheel and the HORN stops. Jesse is splattered with blood and his leg is a mess."

Pieces of his are flying off.  Fingers shot off of a hand.  A knee shot away to reveal the bone.  Dozens of BULLET HITS going off of his chest and head. Finally, the cops start to run out of ammo.  The SHOOTING subsides and finally grinds to a stop, leaving the cops knee-high in brass and a thick layer of gunsmoke in the room. As it clears, Jason still stands.  He teeters a little, then falls backwards with a mighty THUD. Jason lays dying.  Meagan rushes to his side.
