Every shadow, a beckoning invitation...to  disaster.  I know I should  think of other things, of  pleasant things, but I can't.  How can I think of other things,  of pleasant things, when I am  in a place surrounded by  shadows and objects, which can  take any shape, here in the  darkness...Any shape my mind  can conceive.\""
