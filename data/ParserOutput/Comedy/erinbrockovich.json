ON THE SIDEWALK, a SKATEBOARD CA-LUNKS down the sidewalk, past the foot traffic of Southern Californians: flip-flop Doc Marten's, Rollerblades, Nikes ... then, in the middle this pedestrian normalcy, a pair of IMPOSSIBLY HIGH SPIKE HEELED PUMPS struts out of a shop.  So high it hurts to l at them.  As the shoes leave frame, we TILT UP and see they're leaving a 99-cent store. As the Pumps turn and head up the street, we see they are connected to a pair of IMPOSSIBLY LONG, SHAPELY LEGS. Eveready legs -- they just keep going and going. They saunter past two BUSINESSMEN on a lunch break.  The pause and glance as men tend to when they see a beautiful woman.  In fact, everyone this woman passes lets their ey rest on her a microsecond longer than usual. - Two SKATEBOARDERS note the STRETCHY MICRO-MINI skimming tops of her thighs. - A MAILMAN spots the BIG, DARK SUNGLASSES tucked into a MOUNTAIN OF BIG, BLOND HAIR. - A PRE-TEEN GIRL glimpses the PLUNGING NECKLINE of the TIGHT, BRIGHT RED MIDRIFF-BARING BUSTIER. It isn't until she rounds the corner at the end of the bl that we see her entire figure and appreciate why everyone so goggle-eyed.  Eye-catching is an understatement.  All those folks who say Barbie's proportions are unrealistic obviously never met ERIN BROCKOVICH."
