From halfway down the train car, nothing appears amiss, and no passenger looks the wiser. Or so it seems...

Back to Linus, his spoils (a Gucci wallet) now in sight, but he waits for just the right moment, and then, when the train hits another curve... ... he stumbles forward, his left hand finding support on the Stockbroker's shoulder as his right relieves the man of his wallet."
