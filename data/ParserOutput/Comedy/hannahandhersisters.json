A church choir sings a soaring hymn ov the scene. The music continues as the film moves inside, where the choir is seen singing behind an altar glowing warm gold. fairly large congregation sits in darkened pews as the fi cuts to the back, where Mickey, his arms crossed, stands underneath some stained-glass windows, watching and liste to the inspiring music. The choir continues to sing as the movie cuts to Father Flynn in his office. He picks up some large, heavy books from a shelf near his window and he walks over to Mickey, who's standing near h desk, already holding several tomes.  Father Flynn puts t books on top of Mickey's pile; Mickey, flipping through t top one, awkwardly carries his bundle to the door. Next is seen a close-up of a painting of Jesus Christ on cross, complete with crown of thorns and holy expression. His eyes, especially designed to blink as the lights hit them, open and close repeatedly.  The hymn plays on, loud as the camera moves back, revealing Mickey, standing outs a barber shop window, looking at the Christ playing and shuffling from side to side to gets its eyes' 3-D effect. Smaller inspirational pictures border the bigger, blinkin Christ.  A barber pole with moving stripes stands nearby; passing traffic is reflected in the window. Mickey turns from the window, shrugging, and starts to wa down the street, past a fruit and vegetable store with op air-displayed flowers, past several briskly moving pedestrians. With the hymn still playing, the screen goes black briefl Mickey opens the door, the light from a hallway illuminat him.  He's just entered his apartment.  He closes the doo and walks through his dark foyer; he carries a brown bag. He switches on the light, and walking past his spiral staircase, past several framed pictures on the wall, he makes his way to his living room coffee table.  Mickey pu a crucifix out of the bag; he looks at it, then puts it o the table near a pile of books and some objets d'art.  He then takes out a copy of the New Testament, putting it on top of the crucifix.  Then out comes a framed picture of saint.  It too gets put on the growing pile.  But the bag not yet empty.  Next comes a large loaf of Wonder Bread a a large jar of Hellman's mayonnaise.  Mickey sets them on top of the saint."
