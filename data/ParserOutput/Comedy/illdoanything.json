That's his way. Doesn't  hear them do a line. I also have a  way. What I do is interview first-- then read--maybe do it all over again  the next day. I call up people the  actor has worked with--check him  out. If he's famous, I do an opinion  survey to test how much people like  him. If he's not famous, I put him  on tape and show it to everyone I  can grab. I believe in screen tests;  I believe in replacing if the dailies  are bad, in cutting people out if  the previews aren't there. Because  I'm not doing movies for theaters  where they serve cappucino in the  lobby. I'm doing popcorn movies. You  want to know what I like? Come to my  house, look at my lamps... you won't  find it in my movies. In my movies,  you'll find out what I know. I know  how to do detail. What I don't know,  I discover. Yesterday we finished  mixing a movie--the last scene is in  a field of windmills which blows up  and all the blades of these windmills  slice through the air, one of which  hits a four-story tank of propane  gas. A humongous explosion scene. I  kept on saying 'louder', and they  finally said to me they couldn't go  louder without distortion. We went  louder. We had to discover a thing,  a filter, but we went louder. I don't  question doing these things. I do  them. So if you want to know if it's  okay to do it differently--not to  talk--to just read first... I say... (pointing to John  Earl) Ask him--he's the director."
