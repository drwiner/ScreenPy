As we CLOSE IN, we discover that he has opened the box of diapers and that he's holding one of them; its plastic has been carefully cut out with scissors. Casually, glancing right and left, he takes the individ- ual packets of white powder out of his pocket and shoves them into a little plastic bag from the supermarket. Then he carefully tapes the bag so it's well-sealed and flattened out, and he inserts it into the diaper, be- tween the plastic and the absorbent fabric. Next, the diaper is taped up, folded back up and put back in the box, neatly packed between the other ones. Michael closes the box again and glues it together so it looks as if it's never been opened. He throws all the other stuff away in a trash can and grabs hold of his brand-new box of diapers. He walks away."

He    ostensibly takes the brown package out of his plastic   bag and gives it to them. The two punks immediately take off with the package. Graton leaps up, shouts \"let's get 'em\" and takes off after the punks, followed by about 10 other plainclothes detectives, who'd been hiding all around. Michael quickly gets up,    picks Mary up and discreetly deposits the dope-filled    diaper in a trash can, giving the punk on the bench an    intent look. Then he goes off in the direction of the    cops. The punk calmly goes over to the trash can, takes out the diaper, which he stuffs into his girl friend's purse, and goes off in the opposite direction. The cops have meanwhile arrested Peter and Jack, who put up no resistance whatsoever. Michael now joins them."

He looks around and suddenly sees Sylvia and two men deep in discussion coming out of an elevator. Michael, startled, runs and hides behind one of the elevators, staring out wide-eyed. Sylvia is dressed in a very chic, tight black suit, with a veiled little black hat and spiked heels. One of the men is carrying a bunch of cameras. They walk out toward the front door, and Sylvia suddenly stops. She seems to have forgotten something. She kisses them goodbye and heads toward the elevator. Once she's out of their sight, she turns and waits for them to leave. When they're gone for sure, she rushes toward Mary and showers her with kisses."
