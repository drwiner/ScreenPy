He becomes very still. TEARS well up in his eyes. The ballroom clock strikes MIDNIGHT. Kate climbs an opposite staircase to get a better view th STOPS. In her heart SHE KNOWS. Slowly she turns. Leopold  stands quietly at the bottom of the stairs, gazing up at  her. He extends his arm, showing her THE RING. He offers his hand. The crowd, the room, THE WORLD AROUND THEM, DISAPPEAR. Th eyes lock. As she descends the staircase, THE YEARS MELT  AWAY. Kate's short hair grows long, cascading around her  shoulders. The fine lines around Leopold's face are gone. They see themselves through each other's eyes, at the mom of youth, when they fell in love. Leopold bends down, places the slipper on Kate's foot. He rises, looks down at his hands and then up at Kate. His h are caked with mud. She smiles helplessly. Not caring, he wraps his arms tightly around her. MUSIC begins to play, a slow waltz. He nods to her. She t a deep breath. Her head bobs in rhythm. She begins to cou silently. Leopold smiles, counting along. THEY DANCE... An elderly couple watch Leopold with interest."
