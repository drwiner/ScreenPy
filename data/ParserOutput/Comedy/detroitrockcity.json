The boys stomp relentlessly, mercilessly, blasting their  nemesis with hideous cafeteria red as Elvis throws his ar back, body quaking at every splat. It's kind of like the  scene in \"The Godfather\" where Sonny gets it. Beaten and spent, his scream now dried up to a hoarse GAS Elvis slips on some ketchup at his feet. He hits the floo with a THUD right in the goop. He lays there letting out SOBS looking like a bunless wiener. Hawk jumps off the stoop. Taking Elvis's key chain away, hops back up and unlocks the door letting Trip and Lex ou Hawk whips the keys back at Elvis, hitting him in the hea then flashes a pearly Error Flynn smile."

Jam is pushed l a twig in a flood and over the shoulders of those in fron of him. Purely by accident, he is thrown onto the stage  landing on his stomach between Paul and Gene. Just before Peter's drum solo is about to start. Gene, Paul, and Ace silence their instruments. Peter thro his drumstick into the air intending to catch it when it  comes down. But the sight of Jam landing on the stage  distracts him. All is mute as Peter misses the drumstick. It hits the ou edge of one of the drums. Thinking fast, Jam grabs one of his drumsticks out of his sock and tosses it to Peter. It tumbles through the air i SLOW MOTION with a LOW, WHOOPING, HELICOPTER SOUND. We se the word \"Mystery\" clearly as it twirls. Instantly, it's caught in Peter Criss's hand and he bring it down on his drum not missing a beat. The song resumes  with all its fury as Peter's drum kit ascends on a hydrau platform. Jam scrambles from the stage and leaps back into the audi barely missing the claws of some security guards. The four friends pound on each other with unbridled, teen exuberance. Will it ever get any better than this? FREEZE FRAME."
