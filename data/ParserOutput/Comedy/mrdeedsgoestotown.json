COBB (continuing) Mr. Cedar is, and I haven't seen him  in two days. (hangs up the phone) Listen, Cedar, we've got to do something  about the newspapers. CEDAR (barely glancing up) I'm not interested in the newspapers. COBB But it's a great story. Somewhere in  this country a guy is walking into twenty  million bucks. CEDAR Yes, I know. My first concern is to  locate the lucky man. When I do, it's  your job to keep the newspapers away  from him. COBB (resignedly) It's okay with me as long as my weekly  stipend keeps coming in. THE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO A FULL SHOT  as two men rush in with a flurry of  excitement. One of them is Anderson,  an obsequious employee of Cedar's. With  him is another lawyer, one of the Cedar  brothers. ANDERSON We located him, Mr. Cedar! We found  out where he is. CEDAR Good! FIRST BROTHER Yes, John, we got him. ANDERSON Here's the report: Longfellow Deeds,  single, 28, lives in Mandrake Falls,  Vermont. CEDAR (glancing at the report) Thank heaven. FIRST BROTHER Better wire him right away, John. CEDAR I'll do no such thing. I'm going there  myself. You're going with me too, Anderson  - and you too, Cobb. ? 337 ? He pushes a button on the intercom. VOICE Yes? CEDAR Make three reservations on the first  train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont. VOICE (skeptically) Where? CEDAR Mandrake Falls. (begins to spell as scene fades) M-A-N CUT TO: EXT. A STATION 4. MEDIUM SHOT It is a pleasantly rural scene - with  just a handful of local characters scattered  about. At one end of the platform -  some mail - newspapers - and a few pieces  of freight are being loaded. Cedar,  Cobb and Anderson stand in front of  a welcome sign. The three obviously  are out of their element here - obviously  \"City folks.\" Over their shoulders. We hear Cobb's  voice as he reads: COBB'S VOICE Welcome to Mandrake Falls - Where the scenery enthralls - Where no hardship e'er befalls - Welcome to Mandrake Falls. 5. MEDIUM SHOT Cobb and Cedar exchange glances. COBB That's pretty. CEDAR Are you sure this is the town he lives  in? ANDERSON Yes sir, Mr. Cedar. This is the town  all right. CEDAR Well, I dropped everything at the office  - I hope it's not a wild goose chase. ANDERSON No, sir. We checked it thoroughly. He  lives here all right. COBB Ah! I spy a native. Let's ask him. CAMERA MOVES WITH THEM as they cross  to a small, one-story old brick building,  covered with ivy. This is the ticket  and freight office combined. In front  of it is a very old man, a stoop- ? 338 ? shouldered rail agent with a face of  a million wrinkles - puttering around  some packages. CEDAR (as they approach) Good morning. AGENT (glances up) Morning, neighbors. Morning. He picks up a package and disappears  into the building. Cedar and Cobb look  at each other. COBB That's an excellent start. At least  we've broken the ice. The old man returns to his pile of packages. CEDAR I say, my friend, do you know a fellow  by the name of Longfellow Deeds? AGENT Deeds? CEDAR Yes. AGENT Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows  Deeds. CEDAR Yes, I He again disappears. COBB Must be a game he's playing. The old man shows up again. CEDAR We'd like to get in touch with him.  It's very important. AGENT Who's that? CEDAR Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking  about? AGENT Oh, yes - Deeds. Fine fellow. Very democratic.  You won't have no trouble at all. Talk  to anybody. Whereupon the old man carries another  package inside. Cobb is properly exasperated  now. ? 339 ? CEDAR I guess we'd better try somebody else. COBB No, we won't! The next time that jumping  jack comes out, I'll straddle him while  you ask him your questions. The old man emerges from the building  and looks up at them as if he's never  seen them before. AGENT Morning, neighbors. 6. TWO SHOT - COBB AND AGENT (FEATURING  COBB) Cobb grabs the old man as he turns to  head back into the building. COBB Remember us? We're the fellows who were  here a minute ago. AGENT Oh, yes. Yes, indeedy. I never forget  a face. He turns again - but Cobb holds him  by the arm and sets him down on a small  packing case. COBB Listen, Pop, we've come all the way  from New York to look up a fellow by  the name of Deeds. It's important -  very important! AGENT (releasing his arm) You don't have to get rough, neighbor.  All you got to do is ask. COBB Then please pretend, for just one fleeting  moment, that I'm asking. Where does  he reside? AGENT Who? Cobb turns away in disgust. Anderson  steps forward. 7. CLOSE SHOT - THE THREE ANDERSON Longfellow Deeds - where does he live? AGENT Oh, that's what you want! Well, why  didn't you say so in the first place  instead of beating around the bush?  Those other fellows don't know what  they're talking about. (as he exits scene) Come on, I'll take you there in my car.  If they'd only explained to me what  they wanted, there would be no trouble. He leaves Cobb and Cedar staring after  him killingly. ? 340 ? DISSOLVE TO: INT. LONGFELLOW'S LIVING ROOM 8. MEDIUM SHOT A little old lady, Mrs. Meredith, answers  a knock at the door. Cedar, Cobb and  Anderson stand there, with the old man  at their heels. Mrs. Meredith is a sweet,  soft-voiced, timid and fluttery little  creature. MRS. MEREDITH Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen? CEDAR Is Mr. Deeds in? MRS. MEREDITH No - he's over to the park arranging  for the bazaar, so's to raise money  for the fire engine. (to old man) Mal, you shoulda knowed he was in the  park. AGENT Knew it all the time. But these men  said they wanted to see the house. (mumbling as he exits) Can't read their minds if they don't  say what they want. 9. GROUP SHOT Cobb glares after him exasperatedly.  Mrs. Meredith turns to Cobb and Cedar. MRS. MEREDITH Come in, please. Come in. Can I get  you a cup of tea? CEDAR No, thanks. MRS. MEREDITH Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a  glass of lemonade or something? CEDAR That's very kind of you. Are you related  to him? MRS. MEREDITH No, I'm his housekeeper. CEDAR Well, we'd like to find out something  about him. What does he do for a living? MRS. MEREDITH He and Jim Mason own the Tallow Works.  But that's not where he makes his money.  He makes most of it from his poetry. 10. CLOSE SHOT - THE THREE Featuring Cobb. COBB (skeptically) He writes poetry? ? 341 ? MRS. MEREDITH Oh, my goodness, yes. Longfellow's famous.  He writes all those things on postcards.  You know, for Christmas - and Easter  - and birthdays. Sit down, please. She reaches over to a desk and picks  one up. MRS. MEREDITH Here's one - he got $25 for this one. 11. CLOSEUP - MRS. MEREDITH As she reads - with feeling: MRS. MEREDITH \"When you've nowhere to turn - and you're  filled with doubt - Don't stand in midstream, hesitating, For you know that your mother's heart  cries out - 'I'm waiting, my boy, I'm waiting.'\" (she looks up) Isn't that beautiful? 12. CLOSEUP - COBB His eyes open unbelievingly. MRS. MEREDITH'S VOICE Isn't it a lovely sentiment? COBB (flatly) Yeah. A dog enters, racing toward the door,  scratching at it and whining. MRS. MEREDITH (as she heads toward the door) Here he is now. She opens the door and goes out, with  the dog racing ahead. COBB (to Cedar - sotto voce) I suggest you break it to him gently.  He's liable to keel over from the shock. Mrs. Meredith re-appears. We hear her  voice as she comes through the doorway. MRS. MEREDITH They've been waiting a long while. Longfellow Deeds trails behind her. LONGFELLOW Who are they? MRS. MEREDITH I don't know. ? 342 ? CEDAR (standing - formally) Mr. Longfellow Deeds? LONGFELLOW Yes. CEDAR How do you do. LONGFELLOW (shaking hands) How do you do. CEDAR (extending card) I'm John Cedar - of the New York firm  of Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. 13. CLOSE SHOT - GROUP Featuring Cobb. He watches Longfellow  who is glancing at the card. LONGFELLOW (reads to himself) Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. (looks up; smiles) Budington must feel like an awful stranger,  hmm? Cobb's eyes pop at the nifty.[1] CEDAR Mr. Cornelius Cobb and Mr. Anderson. They exchange greetings. Longfellow  gestures to chairs. LONGFELLOW You gentlemen make yourselves comfortable. COBB AND ANDERSON Thanks. 14. MEDIUM SHOT Longfellow crosses to his tuba near  a chair. He takes a mouthpiece out of  his pocket. LONGFELLOW New mouthpiece. Been waiting two weeks  for this. Kids keep swiping them all  the time. They use 'em for bean shooters. (he blows a note) What can I do for you gentlemen? MRS. MEREDITH You gentlemen going to stay for lunch? CEDAR (right to the point; ignoring her) I'd like to ask you a few questions. LONGFELLOW All right. Longfellow looks at them strangely and  sits down beside his tuba. ? 343 ? CEDAR Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph  and Mary Deeds? LONGFELLOW Yes. CEDAR Are your parents living? LONGFELLOW Why, no. CEDAR Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W.  Semple mean anything to you? LONGFELLOW Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think.  I never saw him, but my mother's name  was Semple, you know. CEDAR Well, he passed on. He was killed in  a motor accident in Italy. LONGFELLOW He was? Gee, that's too bad. If there's  anything I can do to While he speaks, he has been adjusting  the tuba between his legs and now sucks  on the mouthpiece, preparatory to playing. CEDAR I have good news for you, sir. Mr. Semple  left a large fortune when he died. He  left it all to you, Mr. Deeds. Deducting  the taxes, it amounts to something in  the neighborhood of $20,000,000. 15. CLOSEUP - LONGFELLOW His lips are over the mouthpiece of  the tuba. His only reaction to the startling  news is to lift his eyes in Cedar's  direction. 16. GROUP SHOT MRS. MEREDITH How about lunch? Are the gentlemen going  to stay - or not? LONGFELLOW Of course they're going to stay. (to the gentlemen) She's got some fresh orange layer cake.  You know, with the thick stuff on the  top? (to Mrs. Meredith) Sure, they don't want to go to the hotel. Mrs. Meredith leaves. Cobb and Cedar  have watched this by-play, open-mouthed,  and are now even more astounded to see  Longfellow blow into his tuba. ? 344 ? 17. CLOSER SHOT - THE THREE CEDAR (over the noise of the tuba) Perhaps you didn't hear what I said,  Mr. Deeds! The whole Semple fortune  goes to you! $20,000,000! LONGFELLOW Oh, yes, I heard you all right. $20,000,000.  That's quite a lot, isn't it? COBB Oh, it'll do in a pinch. LONGFELLOW (impressed) Yes, indeed. I wonder why he left me  all that money? I don't need it. He resumes his 'Oom-pahs.' 18. CLOSE SHOT - CEDAR AND COBB Staring, unbelievingly. DISSOLVE TO: INT. AN ALCOVE 19. FULL SHOT The three men sit around a table, having  lunch. By Longfellow's side is, as expected,  the tuba. CEDAR Mr. Cobb here is an ex-newspaperman  associated with your uncle for many  years - as a sort of buffer. LONGFELLOW Buffer? COBB Yeah. A glorified doormat. CEDAR Yes. You see, rich people need someone  to keep the crowds away. The world's  full of pests. Then there's the newspapers  to handle. One must know when to seek  publicity - and when to avoid it. During Cedar's speech, Longfellow seems  to have been lost in his own thoughts. 20. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW AND COBB Favoring Longfellow. LONGFELLOW Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny,  I can't think of a rhyme for Budington. COBB Why should you? ? 345 ? LONGFELLOW Well, whenever I run across a funny  name, I always like to poke around for  a rhyme. Don't you? COBB Nah. LONGFELLOW I've got one for Cobb 21. CLOSE SHOT - THE GROUP LONGFELLOW \"There once was a man named Cobb, Who kept Semple away from the mob. Came the turn of the tide And Semple - he died - And now poor Cobb's out of a job!\" COBB Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me. LONGFELLOW Huh? COBB I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways  - but never in rhyme. LONGFELLOW Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm  going to need your help. COBB Oh, that's different if it's just poetry. 22. WIDER ANGLE As Mrs. Meredith enters with coffee  which she pours. CEDAR Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds? LONGFELLOW Who - me? No. MRS. MEREDITH No, he's too fussy for that. That's  what's the matter with him. There are  lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake  Falls who're dying to be married LONGFELLOW Don't pay any attention to her. MRS. MEREDITH He's got a lot of foolish notions -  about saving a lady in distress. LONGFELLOW Now you keep out of this! ? 346 ? CEDAR (diplomatically) Saving a lady in distress, eh? Well,  I suppose we all have dreams like that  when we are young. (rising) Incidentally, we'd better get started.  You'll have to pack. LONGFELLOW What for? CEDAR You're going to New York with us. LONGFELLOW When? COBB This afternoon - at four o'clock. LONGFELLOW I don't think we've got any suitcases. MRS. MEREDITH Well, we could borrow a couple from  Mrs. Simpson. You know, she went to  Niagara Falls last year. LONGFELLOW I'm kind of nervous. I've never been  away from Mandrake Falls in my life.  Kind of like to see Grant's Tomb, though. CEDAR (all business) I can understand that. (rises to go) We'll take a walk around town, meet  you at the train at four o'clock. (shakes his hand) Congratulations, Mr. Deeds. You're one  of the richest men in the country. We'll  see you later. (to Mrs. Meredith) Goodbye and thank you. COBB See you later, kid. ANDERSON'S VOICE (as he too exits) Good day, sir. They exit. 23. TWO SHOT - LONGFELLOW AND MRS. MEREDITH LONGFELLOW Hear what he said? You know how much  twenty million is? MRS. MEREDITH I don't care how much it is. You sit  right there and eat your lunch. You  haven't touched a thing. ? 347 ? Longfellow nibbles at some food, staring  into space thoughtfully. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. STATION 24. LONG SHOT The whole town is out. The band is playing  \"He's a Jolly Good Fellow\" - the crowd  sings. It's a festive occasion. A large,  awkwardly painted sign looms over everyone's  head. It reads: FAREWELL LONGFELLOW DEEDS THE PRIDE OF MANDRAKE FALLS 25. MEDIUM SHOT - CEDAR AND ANDERSON They peer anxiously around, looking  for someone, when Cobb dashes in. COBB (breathlessly) I can't find him. CEDAR You can't? COBB I looked everywhere. I even went to  his house. It's locked up. ANDERSON He probably had a change of heart. CEDAR He wasn't very anxious to come in the  first place. COBB (looking on) Here comes the train. Cedar glances off. 26. LONG SHOT (STOCK) Of train approaching. 27. CLOSE SHOT - CEDAR AND COBB The band has already begun and is now  in the midst of \"For He's A Jolly Good  Fellow.\" At this moment, as he looks off, a startled  expression comes into Cobb's eyes. He  grabs Cedar by the arm - who glances  in the direction he points. COBB Look! CEDAR What? COBB That tuba player! ? 348 ? 28. MEDIUM SHOT - THE BAND With Longfellow, in his customary position,  blowing on his tuba. CONTINUATION SCENE 27 Cedar and Cobb stare, wide-eyed, as  the song is finished. COBB Well, now I've seen everything. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. STATION 29. LONG SHOT In the b.g. is the train with Longfellow  standing on the observation platform,  clutching his tuba. On either side of  him is Cedar and Cobb. In the f.g. the  crowd yells its farewell. Several of  them stuff baskets of fruit into his  hands. The band plays \"Auld Lang Syne.\" 30. CLOSE SHOT Over Longfellow and Cobb's shoulders.  As the train begins pulling out. Longfellow  smiles wanly and waves. LONGFELLOW Goodbye, Mrs. Meredith! Goodbye, Jim!  Bye, Buddy! Goodbye, everybody! (a pause) Gosh, I've got a lot of friends. Cobb looks up into Longfellow's face  - affected by the scene. DISSOLVE TO: INT. TRAIN DRAWING ROOM 31. FULL SHOT Longfellow is slumped in his seat, his  legs sprawled out, his eyes ceilingward  - in deep thought. Cobb sits across  from him. Cedar enters, hangs up his  coat, hat and cane. COBB (opening a snifter - generously) Have a drink? LONGFELLOW (distractedly) No, thanks. Cobb and Cedar exchange a look. CEDAR Will you have a cigar? LONGFELLOW No, thank you. Cedar sits down. CEDAR (breaking the silence) I wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course,  a large fortune like this entails a  great responsibility - but you'll have  a good deal of help. So don't worry.  Leave everything to me. ? 349 ? LONGFELLOW Oh, I wasn't worried about that. CEDAR No? LONGFELLOW I was wondering where they're going  to get another tuba player for the band. Cobb has just finished taking a drink  and can't help but nearly spit it out. FADE OUT: FADE IN 32. LONG SHOT (STOCK) The 20th Century crossing the Harlem  River. DISSOLVE TO: 33. ANOTHER STOCK SHOT Of the 20th Century going under the  street level on Park Avenue. DISSOLVE TO: 34. CLOSE SHOT OF OFFICE DOOR Upon which we read: \"CEDAR, CEDAR &  BUDINGTON - ENTRANCE.\" CAMERA PULLS  BACK to take in Cedar, who opens the  door and walks through. INT. GENERAL OFFICE 35. CLOSE TRUCKING SHOT With Cedar as he strides across the  room - in business-like fashion. He  comes to a door marked \"PRIVATE OFFICES.\"  He pushes this door opens and disappears. MAN'S VOICE (as Cedar passes by) Hello, John. Where have you been? CEDAR (as he walks briskly) I've been fishing. In the background is typical office  hub-bub. CEDAR (to a secretary as he passes) Good morning, Celia. SECRETARY Good morning, Mr. Cedar. A chorus of \"Good Morning, Mr. Cedar!\"  issues from the clerks. A secretary  looks up. INT. PRIVATE OFFICES 36. CLOSE TRUCKING SHOT With Cedar - as he passes through the  room - arriving at a door marked \"JOHN  CEDAR, PRIVATE.\" He goes through the  door. ? 350 ? INT. CEDAR'S PRIVATE OFFICES - ANTEROOM 37. FULL SHOT Cedar breezes in and speaks to a secretary. CEDAR Good morning. Where are they? SECRETARY Waiting for you in the other office. He strides across the room to still  another door marked \"PRIVATE\" and he  disappears. DISSOLVE TO: INT. CEDAR'S PRIVATE OFFICE 38. FULL SHOT A group of associates sit around in  large leather chairs, as Cedar barges  in. CEDAR (beaming) Good morning. Hello, boys. The men come to life. Some rise - others  lean forward. Two of them are brothers  of Cedar - tall and athletic. The third  is a small, frightened-looking man.  He is Budington. MEN (ad lib) Hello, John. What happened? Well, what's he like? CEDAR We've got nothing to worry about. He's  as naive as a child. BUDINGTON John CEDAR Close that door. (into dictograph) Will you get Mrs. Cedar on the phone,  please? FIRST BROTHER Come on, John. What happened? CEDAR (to associates) The smartest thing I ever did was to  make that trip. BUDINGTON (anxiously) John, did you get the - uh ? 351 ? 39. MED. SHOT - GROUP Favoring Cedar. CEDAR (interrupting) No, Budington, I didn't get the Power  of Attorney. But don't worry, I will. (beaming to his brothers) I asked him last night what he was going  to do with the money, and what do you  suppose he said? THE TWO BROTHERS (gathering around him) What? I can't imagine. CEDAR He said he guessed he'd give it away. THE TWO BROTHERS (laughing) Give it away!? The boy must be a nit-wit! Budington hasn't enjoyed the joke -  his mind still on their problem. ONE OF THE BROTHERS Well, John, you had the right hunch! BUDINGTON John, if you don't mind my saying so  - we can't afford to CEDAR (irascibly) I know, Budington. We can't afford to  have the books investigated right now.  You must have said that a thousand times  already. BUDINGTON But what if they fall into somebody  else's hands, why - uh CEDAR Well, it hasn't happened yet - has it? BUDINGTON (wailing) But a half million dollars! My goodness,  where are we going to get CEDAR (exploding) Will you stop worrying! It was I who  got old man Semple to turn everything  over to us, wasn't it? And who got the  Power of Attorney from him ! All right,  and I'll get it again! (pause - change of tone) I'll take it easy. Those books'll never  leave this office. ? 352 ? DISSOLVE TO: INT. AN APARTMENT 40. MEDIUM SHOT George Semple, a ne'er-do-well, prominent  for the pouches under his eyes and a  perpetual nose-twitch, is sprawled out  in a chair reading a newspaper. A nagging  wife walks around him. WIFE A yokel! Nothing but a yokel! Your uncle  must have been mad to leave all that  money to him! You're as closely related  to him as he is, and what did you get? She storms around the room. George merely  twitches his nose but says nothing. WIFE (slaps the paper George is reading) I say, what did you get? GEORGE Stop yelling. Can I help it if my uncle  didn't like me? WIFE I told you to be nice to him. Ten years  we've been waiting for that old man  to kick off. And then we were going  to be on Easy Street. Yeah - on Easy  Street! GEORGE Oh, shut up! It's too late now, and  you're a nuisance! WIFE That's just what I'm going to be - a  nuisance. I'm going to be a nuisance  until I get hold of some of that money! DISSOLVE TO: INT. EDITOR'S OFFICE, DAILY MAIL 41. FULL SHOT The editor stands in front of his desk.  Four of five reporters in front of him  - several photographers. In the b.g.,  leaning against the wall near the door,  apparently indifferent, is Babe Bennett.  The editor, Mac, is haranguing them. MAC (as he blows his nose) He's news! Every time he blows his nose,  it's news. A corn-fed bohunk like that  falling into the Semple fortune is hot  copy . . . But it's got to be personal.  It's got to have an angle. What does  he think about? How does it feel to  be a millionaire! Is he going to get  married! What does he think of New York!  Is he smart? Is he dumb? . . . A million  angles! 42. CLOSE SHOT - BABE She has a string in her hand which she  keeps flicking, trying to get a knot  into it - in the manner of cowboys with  a rope. Mac's voice continues over scene: ? 353 ? 43. MEDIUM SHOT Of them all, as Mac continues: MAC He's been here three days, and what  have you numbskulls brought in! Any  halfwit novice could have done better! REPORTER'S VOICE Yeah, we tried too MAC Am I talking too loud? Or annoying anybody? REPORTER You know Corny Cobb. He's keeping him  under lock and key. MAC Cobb, Cobb! Never mind about Cobb. Use  what little brains you've got! Find  out something yourselves, you imbecilic  stupes! Now get out of here before I  really tell you what I think of you.  Come on, get out! They scramble to their feet. One of  the reporters mumbles something as he  passes Mac on the way to the door. REPORTER (Mumbles.) MAC (alert) What was that? REPORTER (thinking fast - covering up) Huh? I said you had dirty plaster. 44. MED. CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR As Babe is still flicking her string,  trying to get a knot. The reporters  file past her on their way out. Just  as the last one is approaching, she  succeeds in doing the trick. 45. MEDIUM SHOT As Mac turns to Babe. MAC You too! Thought I could depend on you,  but you're getting as bad as the rest  of them. He grabs up a handful of papers and  starts out. BABE (flicking the string) Look, I can do it! MAC What's gotten into you, Babe? I remember  the time when you'd blast this town  wide open before you'd let Cobb get  away with a thing like this. ? 354 ? 46. CLOSE TWO SHOT BABE Oh, he's not getting away with anything. MAC (excited) Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on  this guy, and you can have BABE Can I have a month's vacation? MAC With pay! BABE With pay! MAC Uh-huh. BABE (casually, as she starts away) Leave four columns open on the front  page tomorrow. 47. MEDIUM SHOT As Babe crosses to door. MAC Now you're talking, Babe. I'll keep  the whole front page open. What are  you going to do? BABE (at door) Have lunch. She exits. Mac's face lights up happily. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. RESIDENCE 48. LONG SHOT Of a large, imposing-looking residence. INT. LONGFELLOW'S BEDROOM 49. MEDIUM SHOT Longfellow stands awkwardly between  two tailors - who chalk and pin a suit  on him. After a few seconds of silence: LONGFELLOW It's the first time I ever had a suit  made on purpose. The tailors smile accommodatingly as  CAMERA PULLS BACK and we discover that  both Cedar and Cobb are present. Cobb  is slumped in a chair, and Cedar is  carefully putting some papers away in  a portfolio. ? 355 ? CEDAR It's merely a suggestion. I don't wish  to press the point, Mr. Deeds, but if  you'll give me your Power of Attorney  we'll take care of everything. It'll  save you a lot of petty annoyances.  Every shark in town will be trying to  sell you something. LONGFELLOW Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them  around here already. Strangest kind  of people. Salesmen - politicians -  moochers - all want something. I haven't  had a minute to myself. Haven't seen  Grant's Tomb yet. CEDAR Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother  with that sort of thing. He left everything  to us. He traveled most of the time,  and enjoyed himself. You should do the  same thing, Mr. Deeds. LONGFELLOW Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you  also want to handle my investments too? CEDAR Yes. That is to say LONGFELLOW Well, outside of your regular fee, how  much extra will it cost? CEDAR (too quickly) Oh - nothing. No extra charge. LONGFELLOW That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't  it? CEDAR (generously) Yes, but that's an added service a firm  like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington  usually donates. LONGFELLOW Budington. Funny, I can't think of a  rhyme for Budington yet. 50. WIDER ANGLE As a butler stands in the doorway. BUTLER The gentlemen from the opera are still  waiting in the board room, sir. They're  getting a trifle impatient, sir. LONGFELLOW They are? I forgot all about them. (to Cobb) What do you think they want? ? 356 ? CEDAR Well, your uncle was Chairman of the  Board of Directors. They probably expect  you to carry on. COBB (rising) I'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts  on, that you'll be right down. LONGFELLOW Thanks (suddenly) Oh, did you send that telegram to Jim  Mason? COBB Jim Mason? Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't  send it. I've got it written out, though.  Here it is. (reaches into his pocket and reads) \"Arthur's been with the Tallow Works  too long. STOP. Don't think we should  fire him. Longfellow.\" LONGFELLOW Fine. Send it right away. I don't want  him to fire Arthur. COBB Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire  Arthur. LONGFELLOW He was the last baby my father delivered,  Arthur was. CEDAR I think you ought to give this matter  some thought, Mr. Deeds. LONGFELLOW Huh? CEDAR I mean, about the Power of Attorney. LONGFELLOW Oh, yes. Yes, I will. Cobb has stalled long enough to hear  Longfellow's decision before he goes  out of the room. LONGFELLOW I'll give it a lot of thought. There  was a fellow named Winslow here a little  while ago, wanted to handle my affairs  for nothing too. It puzzles me why these  people all want to work for nothing.  It isn't natural. So I guess I'd better  think about it some more. 51. MEDIUM SHOT Longfellow, Cedar and the two tailors. TAILOR That's that. ? 357 ? LONGFELLOW You go to an awful lot of work to keep  a fellow warm, don't you? TAILOR Yes, sir. A butler enters again. BUTLER A Mr. Hallor to see you sir. CEDAR (quickly) Did you say Hallor? BUTLER Yes, sir. CEDAR Well, don't let him in. LONGFELLOW Why not? Who is he? CEDAR A lawyer representing some woman with  a claim against the estate. (to butler) Tell him to see me at my office. LONGFELLOW Well, if he has a claim, we'd better  see him. (to butler) Send him in. The butler disappears. CEDAR He's capable of causing you a lot of  trouble, Mr. Deeds. LONGFELLOW How can he make any trouble for me?  I haven't done anything. The butler reappears, followed by Hallor.  The minute he appears, Cedar speaks  up belligerently. CEDAR I thought I told you to take up this  matter with me, Hallor. 52. MED. CLOSE GROUP SHOT HALLOR I'm a little tired of being pushed around  by you, Mr. Cedar - I don't care how  important you are. (to Longfellow) Mr. Deeds, I represent Mrs. Semple. ? 358 ? LONGFELLOW (eyebrows raised) Mrs. Semple? HALLOR Yes. Your uncle's common-law wife. She  has a legal claim on the estate. CEDAR We'll let the courts decide what her  legal position is. HALLOR You wouldn't dare go into court with  a case like this - and you know it! He turns to Longfellow, who has listened  to them studyingly. HALLOR I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you  conceive of any court not being in sympathy  with any woman who gave up the best  years of her life for an old man like  your uncle? LONGFELLOW What kind of wife did you say she was? HALLOR Common-law wife. On top of that, there's  a child. LONGFELLOW A child? My uncle's? HALLOR Yes, sir. LONGFELLOW That's awful. The poor woman should  be taken care of immediately. HALLOR (pleased) I'm glad to see you're willing to be  reasonable, Mr. Deeds. LONGFELLOW If she was his wife, she should have  all the money. That's only fair. I don't  want a penny of it. He yanks his trousers off and hands  them to the tailor. CEDAR Don't make any rash promises As the tailors exit, Cobb returns. COBB You'd better get right down there. That  opera mob is about to break into the  Mad Song from \"Lucia.\"[2] ? 359 ? LONGFELLOW (to Hallor) Oh, I don't want to keep them waiting  any longer. They're important people. (to Cobb) I wish you'd go along with me, Cobb.  They're all strangers to me. HALLOR Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds? LONGFELLOW (getting into robe - to Hallor) You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be  right back. He exits with Cobb. INT. CORRIDOR 53. MED. TRUCKING SHOT As Longfellow and Cobb come out and  start down corridor. LONGFELLOW Gee, I'm busy. Did the opera people  always come here for their meetings? COBB Uh-huh. LONGFELLOW That's funny. Why is that? COBB (wisely) Why do mice go where there's cheese?[3] INT. BOARD ROOM 54. FULL SHOT A group of eight distinguished-looking  men sit around a long table, awaiting  Longfellow's arrival. At the head of  the table is a Mr. Douglas. DOUGLAS From what I'm led to believe, the young  man's quite childish. I don't think  we'll have any difficulty in getting  him to put up the entire amount. After  all, it's only a matter of $180,000. CHORUS OF VOICES A drop in the bucket for him. An excellent idea! Why not? . . . DOUGLAS (slyly) You know, gentlemen, we're really very  fortunate the young man is so sympathetic  toward music. (winking) He plays the tuba in the town band. MAN (who has been watching at door) Here he comes. ? 360 ? DOUGLAS Good. There is a shuffle of preparation. DISSOLVE TO: INT. DIRECTOR'S ROOM 55. SAME SCENE With Longfellow and Cobb present. Longfellow  looks around, completely awed. DOUGLAS Now, gentlemen, the first order of business  will be the election of a new Chairman  of the Board. A MAN (rising) As a sentimental gesture toward the  best friend opera ever had, the late  Mr. Semple, I think it only fitting  that his nephew, Mr. Longfellow Deeds,  should be made our next Chairman. I  therefore nominate him. A VOICE Second. DOUGLAS All those in favor . . . EVERYBODY Aye. DOUGLAS Carried. (rises) My congratulations, Mr. Deeds. 56. CLOSER SHOT Featuring Longfellow. LONGFELLOW (self-consciously) I'm Chairman? DOUGLAS (humoring a child) Oh Yes, of course - you've just been  elected. LONGFELLOW (to Cobb) I'm Chairman. COBB (dryly) Happy voyage. DOUGLAS Right here, Mr. Deeds. ? 361 ? 57. WIDER ANGLE As Longfellow is led to the president's  chair. Douglas sits next to him. DOUGLAS Now, the next order of business is the  reading of the Secretary's minutes .  . . A VOICE Move we dispense with it. ANOTHER VOICE Second. DOUGLAS All in favor? CHORUS OF VOICES Aye! Longfellow looks his surprise. DOUGLAS I think they can be dispensed with.  We're ready now for the reading of the  Treasurer's report. A VOICE Move we dispense with it. ANOTHER VOICE Second. DOUGLAS All in favor? CHORUS OF VOICES Aye! DOUGLAS Quite right! Now, gentlemen, the next  business will be 58. MED. CLOSE SHOT Featuring Longfellow, as he interrupts: LONGFELLOW Wait a minute. What does the Chairman  do? DOUGLAS Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings. LONGFELLOW That's what I thought. If you don't  mind, I'm rather interested in the Treasurer's  report. I'd like to hear it. There is an uncomfortable shuffle. For  a few minutes, no one speaks. From the  rear, a tall man rises. ? 362 ? 59. CLOSE SHOT Featuring treasurer. TREASURER The treasurer reports a deficit of $180,000  for the current year. 60. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW He is stunned. LONGFELLOW A deficit! You mean we've lost that  much? 61. WIDER ANGLE To include all at table. DOUGLAS You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not  conducted for profit. LONGFELLOW It isn't? What is it conducted for? DOUGLAS Why, it's an artistic institution LONGFELLOW We own an opera house, don't we? A VOICE We do. LONGFELLOW And we give shows? DOUGLAS We provide opera. LONGFELLOW But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets? VOICE Of course. LONGFELLOW And it doesn't pay? DOUGLAS That's impossible. The opera has never  paid. LONGFELLOW (conclusively) Well, then, we must give the wrong kind  of shows. Cobb smiles. The directors are stumped. 62. MED. CLOSE SHOT Featuring Douglas and Longfellow. DOUGLAS The wrong kind! There isn't any wrong  or right kind. Opera is opera! ? 363 ? LONGFELLOW I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't  care to be head of a business that kept  losing money. That wouldn't be common  sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000  coming from? DOUGLAS Well, we were rather expecting it to  come from you. LONGFELLOW Me?! DOUGLAS Naturally. LONGFELLOW Excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing  natural about that . He is suddenly startled. His ears prick  up. 63. SHOT OF DIRECTORS They all stare at Longfellow. Over scene  comes the low wailing cry of a siren,  which increases in volume as it gets  closer to the building. 64. MEDIUM SHOT Longfellow jumps up. LONGFELLOW Hey, a fire engine! He rushes to the window and peers out.  The others stare unbelievably. The shriek  of the siren finally dies down. Longfellow  turns back. LONGFELLOW (admiringly) Gee, that was a pip![4] (as he goes back to his seat) We expect we're going to have one like  that in Mandrake Falls pretty soon   with a siren, too. There is a pause while he gets seated. LONGFELLOW Now, where were we? 65. MED. CLOSE SHOT AT TABLE DOUGLAS You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not  conducted like any ordinary business. LONGFELLOW Why not? DOUGLAS Because it just isn't a business, that's  all! ? 364 ? LONGFELLOW Well, maybe it isn't to you, but it  certainly is a business to me, if I  have to make up a loss of $180,000.  If it's losing that much money, there  must be something wrong. Maybe you charge  too much. Maybe you're selling bad merchandise.  Maybe lots of things. I don't know.  You see, I expect to do a lot of good  with that money. And I can't afford  to put it into anything that I don't  look into. That's my decision for the  time being, gentlemen. Goodbye, and  thank you for making me Chairman. 66. MED. SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE He exits, followed by Cobb, whose eyes  shriek his admiration. The directors  watch them leave, flabbergasted. Cobb's  head reappears in doorway. COBB Gentlemen, you'll find the smelling  salts in the medicine chest. He disappears. The Board of Directors  stare in dumb stupefaction at the door. WIPE OFF TO: INT. LONGFELLOW'S BEDROOM 67. MED. SHOT As Longfellow enters. Hallor and Cedar  rise. LONGFELLOW Sorry to keep you waiting so long. Those  opera people are funny. They wanted  me to put up $180,000. HALLOR What about it, Mr. Deeds? LONGFELLOW Why, I turned them down, naturally. HALLOR No, I mean - about my client. LONGFELLOW Oh - we'll have to do something about  the common wife. Longfellow's valet, Walter, enters and  holds up a full dress suit. WALTER Tails tonight, sir? LONGFELLOW What - tails? (turns and sees it) Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you  want people to laugh at me? I never  wore one of those things in my life. WALTER Yes, sir. ? 365 ? The tailors are leaving. TAILOR (shaking hands with Longfellow) Goodbye, and thank you sir. LONGFELLOW Goodbye. (turning to the others) Wants me to wear a monkey suit. Cedar and Hallor smile accommodatingly.  Walter hands him a pair of trousers. 68. CLOSER SHOT OF GROUP As Longfellow starts getting into the  trousers. HALLOR Of course, we don't want to appear greedy,  Mr. Deeds. LONGFELLOW Huh? HALLOR I say we don't want to appear greedy. LONGFELLOW Oh. That. Walter has gotten down on his knees  and holds the ends of the pants. LONGFELLOW What do you think you're doing? WALTER Why, I'm assisting you, sir. LONGFELLOW Get up from there. I don't want anybody  holding the ends of my pants. Get up  from there! WALTER (rising) Yes, sir. LONGFELLOW (to others) Imagine that - holding the ends of my  pants! Hallor smiles feebly - his impatience  growing. HALLOR Mrs. Semple is entitled by law to one-third  of the estate. LONGFELLOW (to Walter) And don't ever get down on your knees  again, understand? ? 366 ? WALTER No, sir. LONGFELLOW (to Hallor) Excuse me. What did you say? HALLOR Mrs. Semple is entitled to one-third  of the estate. LONGFELLOW One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't  it? HALLOR (quietly) Well, we didn't expect that much. I'm  sure I can get her to settle quietly  for one million. CEDAR If there's any talk of settlement, Hallor,  take it up with me at the office. HALLOR I'll do no such thing LONGFELLOW That's right. Don't you go to his office.  There's only one place you're going,  and that's out the door. Hallor looks up, surprised. HALLOR You're making a mistake, Mr. Deeds. LONGFELLOW Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face.  Besides, there's something fishy about  a person who would settle for a million  dollars when they can get seven million.  I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's  supposed to be a smart man, couldn't  see through that. HALLOR Now wait a minute, buddy 69. MED. SHOT Longfellow crosses to bell cord and  pulls it. LONGFELLOW There's one nice thing about being rich  - you ring a bell and things happen.  When the servant comes in, Mr. Hallor,  I'm going to ask him to show you to  the door. Many people don't know where  it is. HALLOR No use in getting tough. That'll get  you nowhere, Mr. Deeds. (strongly) You know, we've got letters. ? 367 ? As a butler enters, Longfellow turns  to him. LONGFELLOW Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front  door? BUTLER Yes, sir. 70. CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR As Hallor gets to it. Longfellow grabs  him by the shirt front and half lifts  him off the floor. LONGFELLOW And listen, there isn't any wife - there  aren't any letters - and I think you're  a crook. So you better watch your step. He shoves Hallor violently and he stumbles  out of scene. Cobb enters to Longfellow,  his hand extended. COBB I can't hold out on you any longer.  Lamb bites wolf. (shakes his head) Beautiful. LONGFELLOW Only common sense. 71. MED. SHOT Cedar has been most uncomfortable through  the scene, but now suavely assumes an  admiring attitude. CEDAR (a forced smile) I can't hold out any longer either,  Mr. Deeds. (holds out his hand) Being an attorney for you will be a  very simple affair. LONGFELLOW You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar.  Not till I find out what's on your mind.  Suppose you get the books straightened  out quick so I can have a look at them. CEDAR Yes, of course, if you wish. But you  must be prepared. This sort of thing  will be daily routine. (picks up his hat) If it becomes annoying, you let me know.  Goodbye, Mr. Deeds. Goodbye, sir. Longfellow shakes his hand. Cedar exits.  Longfellow stares after him disgustedly,  wiping his hands with his handkerchief. LONGFELLOW Even his hands are oily. Walter has entered and holds up a coat  for Longfellow. ? 368 ? COBB Well, how about tonight? What would  you like in the way of entertainment? LONGFELLOW Entertainment? 72. CLOSE TWO SHOT COBB Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones,  tall and stately. How would you like  yours? Dark or fair, tall or short,  fat or thin, tough or tender? LONGFELLOW What're you talking about? COBB Women! Ever heard of 'em? LONGFELLOW Oh. COBB Name your poison and I'll supply it. LONGFELLOW Some other time, Cobb. Some other time. COBB Okay, you're the boss. (as he goes) When your blood begins to boil, yell  out. I'll be seeing you! 73. MED. SHOT As Cobb exits. Longfellow turns to Walter,  the valet. LONGFELLOW He talks about women as if they were  cattle. WALTER Every man to his taste, sir. LONGFELLOW Tell me, Walter, are all those stories  I hear about my uncle true? WALTER Well, sir, he sometimes had as many  as twenty in the house at the same time. LONGFELLOW Twenty! What did he do with them? WALTER That was something I was never able  to find out, sir. WIPE OFF TO: ? 369 ? EXT. CORRIDOR 74. MED. SHOT Longfellow, exiting his bedroom, wearing  a coat and hat. He comes to the top  of a grand staircase, looks around slyly  and sees that no one is watching. He  slides down the bannister and touches  the statue at the bottom for good luck. He starts for the door. When he gets  there he finds his way barred by two  husky-looking mugs. He looks up surprised. FIRST BODYGUARD Hey, you going out? LONGFELLOW Why yes. Isn't that all right? 2ND BODYGUARD No. Don't ever want to go out without  telling us. LONGFELLOW Who are you? BODYGUARDS We're your bodyguards. LONGFELLOW Oh, yeah. 2ND BODYGUARD Yeah, Mr. Cobb said stick to your tail  no matter what. LONGFELLOW That's very nice of Mr. Cobb - but I  don't want anybody sticking to my tail  no matter what. FIRST BODYGUARD Sorry, mister. Orders is orders. LONGFELLOW Is that so? 2ND BODYGUARD Yes, sir. We gotta get you up in the  morning - and we gotta put you to bed  at night. FIRST BODYGUARD Only it's all right. No matter what  we see - we don't see nuttin', see? LONGFELLOW (smiling) That's going to be fun. 2ND BODYGUARD Some people like it. Longfellow glances around the room thoughtfully,  then continues: LONGFELLOW Uh, will you do something for me before  we go out? ? 370 ? FIRST BODYGUARD Sure! The first bodyguard eagerly takes out  a pistol. The second bodyguard slaps  it away. 2ND BODYGUARD (to first bodyguard) Put that away, slug! (to Longfellow) At your service! LONGFELLOW I got a trunk in that room. Will you  get it out for me? 2ND BODYGUARD Certainly. FIRST BODYGUARD With pleasure. The two bodyguards accommodatingly enter  a closet. The moment they are gone,  Longfellow closes the door calmly and  turns the key. BODYGUARDS (ad-lib) Hey, hey! We're your bodyguards. You  can't do this! Longfellow whistles as he exits. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE 75. MED. CLOSE SHOT Longfellow comes out, glances over the  horizon. The air is filled with a slight  drizzle and he sighs happily. CUT TO: INT. TAXI CAB 76. CLOSE SHOT Babe and two photographers, Bob and  Frank, are huddled conspiratorially  in the back seat of a taxi cab. BABE (pointing) There he is. Yep, that's him. BOB That's who? BABE Get the cameras ready and follow me. FRANK What are you going to do? BABE Never mind. Follow me and grab whatever  you can get. ? 371 ? BOB I suppose it's going to be the same  old thing. FRANK I tell you that dame's nuts. BOB Right. CUT TO: EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE 77. MED. CLOSE SHOT Longfellow is exiting front gate. 78. MED. SHOT From his angle. Out of the shadows a  girl comes into view and staggers forward.  She reaches a tree and clutches it weakly.  Then her strength failing, she crumples  to the ground. 79. MED. CLOSE SHOT Longfellow's eyes widen in apprehension  as he starts forward - CAMERA FOLLOWING  HIM. He reaches the girl and bending  down, lifts her head. We see it is Babe  Bennett. Her eyes are closed, apparently  in a dead faint. 80. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW AND BABE  - LOW ANGLE Longfellow studies her face for a moment,  then starts to lift her. As he does  so, her eyes open and she looks up at  him, feigning bewilderment. LONGFELLOW You fainted. BABE (feebly) Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . . She struggles to get to her feet. 81. WIDER ANGLE Longfellow tries to assist her. LONGFELLOW Can I help you? BABE No, thank you. I'll be all right. LONGFELLOW Look, this is my house. I'd like to BABE Oh, no, really - I'll be all right. LONGFELLOW What happened? BABE Well, I guess I walked too much. I've  been looking for a job all day. I found  one, too. I start tomorrow. ? 372 ? (backing away) You've been awfully kind. Thank you  very much. As she leaves him, Longfellow watches  her, full of sympathy. She takes a few  steps and, again feigning weakness,  falls against the iron fence, clutching  it. Longfellow rushes to her assistance. 82. CLOSE TWO SHOT LONGFELLOW (looking around) Hey, taxi! CUT TO: INT. TAXI CAB 83. CLOSE SHOT BOB (to driver) Hey, stupe! Follow that cab they just  got into, will you? Hurry up! Step on  it! FRANK Come on, come on! BOB Hurry up! DISSOLVE TO: INSERT: AN ELECTRIC SIGN: \"TULLIO'S  EAT WITH THE LITERATI\" DISSOLVE TO: INT. TULLIO'S 84. MED. CLOSE SHOT A corner table, surrounded by ferns,  at which Longfellow and Babe sit. She's  still eating. LONGFELLOW Feel better now? BABE Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I  don't know how I can ever thank you. LONGFELLOW Tell me more about yourself. BABE Well, I guess I've told you almost everything  there is to tell. My folks live in a  small town near Hartford. I'm down here  alone trying to make a living. (hanging her head) Oh, I'm really just a nobody. Longfellow spots a strolling violinist.  He furtively beckons the fellow over.  The musician leans into them with romantic  strains. ? 373 ? BABE (as the musician finishes and strolls  away) Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you. LONGFELLOW You were a lady in distress, weren't  you? BABE (looks up) What? LONGFELLOW Oh - uh - nothing. 85. WIDER ANGLE As a waiter enters the scene and begins  removing dishes. LONGFELLOW Waiter! Has anybody come in yet? WAITER Huh? On, no. Nobody important. LONGFELLOW Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't  you? WAITER Uh-huh. LONGFELLOW I'm a writer myself, you know. The waiter throws Longfellow a sidelong  glance of complete boredom. WAITER Uh-huh. LONGFELLOW I write poetry. WAITER Uh-huh. He exits. 86. CLOSE TWO SHOT - BABE AND LONGFELLOW BABE You've been having quite an exciting  time here, haven't you? All those meetings  and business deals and society people  - haven't you been having fun? LONGFELLOW No. That is, I didn't (pause - while he looks at her) Until I met you. I like talking to you,  though (moodily) Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep. ? 374 ? 87. WIDER ANGLE The waiter enters again. WAITER Brookfield just came in. LONGFELLOW Oh, the poet? Where? WAITER Over at that big round table. The one  that looks like a poodle. Longfellow stares off scene - his eyes  full of worship. LONGFELLOW (to Babe) Look - there's Brookfield, the poet. BABE (looks also) Really? 88. MED. SHOT From their angle, to show people at  a table, engaged in conversation. 89. MED. CLOSE SHOT At Longfellow's table. He stares off  at them, awed. Babe watches his face. 90. MED. SHOT - AUTHOR'S TABLE A group of five men, drinking - as the  waiter enters. WAITER (confidentially - indicating Longfellow) Pardon. Longfellow Deeds, who just inherited  the Semple fortune, wants to meet you. BROOKFIELD Oh, yes. I read about him. He writes  poetry on postcards. HENABERRY Let's invite him over. Might get a couple  of laughs. Getting rather dull around  here. MORROW It's always dull here. BROOKFIELD (rising) I'll get him. HENABERRY Good. ? 375 ? DISSOLVE TO: 91. MED. SHOT - ROUND TABLE At which they are all seated now. Babe  sits next to Longfellow, who is the  center of attraction. Brookfield is  just finishing introductions. BROOKFIELD Henaberry, Mr. Morrow, Bill - this is  Mr. Deeds and his fiancee from Mandrake  Falls. THE GROUP (ad-lib) How do! Hello! Nice to meet you! LONGFELLOW Nice of you to ask us to come and sit  with you. Back home we never get a chance  to meet famous people. BILL (calling waiter) Waiter! A little service here. THE GROUP (ad-lib) Yes! Mr. Deeds is a distinguished poet. A drink for Mr. Deeds! HENABERRY He's a poet. Have a drink. LONGFELLOW No - I don't want it, thank you. HENABERRY Why, you must drink! All poets drink! 92. MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE GROUP BILL Tell us, Mr. Deeds. How do you go about  writing your poems? We craftsmen are  very interested in one another's methods. HENABERRY Yes. Do you have to wait for an inspiration,  or do you just dash it off? LONGFELLOW (self-consciously) Well, I don't know. I HENABERRY Mr. Morrow, over there, for instance,  just dashes them off. ? 376 ? MORROW Yes. That's what my publishers have  been complaining about. They all laugh superficially. 93. CLOSE SHOT GROUP - BABE AND LONGFELLOW Babe glances up at Longfellow, to see  if he's aware that he is being laughed  at. But he apparently isn't. LONGFELLOW (laughing feebly) Your readers don't complain, Mr. Morrow. MORROW'S VOICE Oh, thanks. Thanks. BROOKFIELD How about you, Mr. Deeds? LONGFELLOW Well, I write mine on order. The people  I work for just tell me what they want  and then I go to work and write it. BROOKFIELD Amazing! Why, that's true genius! HENABERRY Yes. Have you any peculiar characteristics  when you are creating? LONGFELLOW Well, I play the tuba. They all laugh. MORROW I've been playing the harmonica for  forty years - didn't do me a bit of  good. 94. CLOSE SHOT - GROUP BROOKFIELD You wouldn't have one in your pocket,  would you, Mr. Deeds? LONGFELLOW (smiling) What? A tuba? They all laugh. BROOKFIELD No, a postcard - with one of your poems  on it. Longfellow is beginning to sense he  is being kidded. LONGFELLOW (his face sober) No. ? 377 ? HENABERRY You mean to tell me you don't carry  a pocketful around with you? BROOKFIELD Too bad! I was hoping you'd autograph  one for me. HENABERRY I was too. BILL Quite right. 95. MED. GROUP SHOT As they keep on. Longfellow has his  eyes levelled on each speaker in turn,  obviously cognizant of their ill-concealed  jibes. HENABERRY Wait a minute, boys. Perhaps Mr. Deeds  would recite one for us. THE OTHER'S VOICES (ad-lib) Yes! BROOKFIELD That's a very good idea. Nothing like  a poet reciting his own stuff. ONE OF THE OTHERS How about a Mother's Day poem, Mr. Deeds? HENABERRY Exactly! Give us one that wrings the  great American heart. THE GROUP (ad-lib) Yes. Babe has been watching Longfellow, interested.  Now, when their voices die down - and  they wait expectantly - he speaks quietly. LONGFELLOW (deeply hurt) I guess I get the idea. I guess I know  why I was invited here. To make fun  of me. 96. MED. SHOT - GROUP SEVERAL VOICES (ad-lib) Oh, come now. I wouldn't say that. HENABERRY Look, he's temperamental. ? 378 ? LONGFELLOW (levelling off at him) Yeah, what if I am? What about it? Henaberry's face sobers. LONGFELLOW (simply) It's easy to make fun of somebody if  you don't care how much you hurt 'em. (to Brookfield) I think your poems are swell, Mr. Brookfield,  but I'm disappointed in you. I know  I must look funny to you, but maybe  if you went to Mandrake Falls you'd  look just as funny to us . Only nobody  would laugh at you and make you feel  ridiculous - 'cause that wouldn't be  good manners. 97. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW As he rises, continuing: LONGFELLOW I guess maybe it is comical to write  poems for postcards, but a lot of people  think they're good. Anyway, it's the  best I can do. So if you'll excuse me,  we'll be leaving. I guess I found out  that all famous people - aren't big  people . . . 98. MED. SHOT The group watches him silently as he  leaves the table accompanied by Babe.  For a moment they are nonplussed - then  they break into raucous laughter - all  but Morrow. 99. CLOSE TRUCKING SHOT With Longfellow and Babe as they take  several steps. Then he abruptly stops. LONGFELLOW (turning to them) There's just one thing more. If it weren't  for Miss Dawson being here with me,  I'd probably bump your heads together. BABE (quickly) Oh, I don't mind. Longfellow stares at her for a moment. LONGFELLOW Then I guess maybe I will. He starts back toward the table. 100. MED. SHOT AT TABLE Protectively, Brookfield and Henaberry  rise from their chairs. But they are  too late, for Longfellow clips Brookfield  on the chin first with his left fist  - and with his right catches Henaberry  on the jaw. The punches are almost simultaneous.  The surprise attack catches the men  off-guard and they fall backward. A  waiter rushes forward to escort Longfellow  and Babe out. ? 379 ? WAITER (calling out) Manager! Morrow, who never budged from his chair,  and who has watched Longfellow with  great admiration, now rises to catch  up to him. MORROW (an outcry) Eureka! INT. FOYER OF TULLIO'S 101. MED. SHOT As Morrow catches up to Longfellow and  Babe, who are on their way out. The  waiter is shooing people away. WAITER Step aside, step aside! Morrow barges forward. Longfellow and  Babe turn. MORROW (obviously groggy with drink) Say fellow, you neglected me - and I  feel very put out. (points to his chin) Look, sock it right there, will you?  Lay one right on the button,[6] but  sock it hard. 102. CLOSE SHOT - THE THREE LONGFELLOW That's all right. I got it off my chest. MORROW The difference between them and me is  I know when I've been a skunk. You take  me to the nearest news-stand and I'll  eat a pack of your postcards raw. Raw! Longfellow and Babe smile. As Morrow  continues to speak, he sways drunkenly  and would fall over backwards a couple  of times in midsentence if the alert  Longfellow didn't have a clutch on his  collar. MORROW Oh, what a magnificent deflation of  smugness. Pal, you've added ten years  to my life! A poet with a straight left  and a right hook - delicious! Delicious!  You're my guest from now on - forever  and a day - even unto eternity! LONGFELLOW Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going  out to see the sights. MORROW Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me  a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like  to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard  my magic carpet (Longfellow catches him before he falls  backward in his enthusiasm) thanks - and I'll show you sights that  you've never seen before. ? 380 ? LONGFELLOW I'd kind of like to see Grant's Tomb  - and the Statue of Liberty. 103. CLOSE SHOT - GROUP Favoring Morrow. MORROW Well, you'll not only see those, but  before the evening's half through, you'll  be leaning against the Leaning Tower  of Pisa - you'll mount Mt. Everest.  I'll show you the Pyramids and all the  little Pyramiddes, leaping from sphinx  to sphinx. Pal, how would you like to  go on a real, old-fashioned binge? LONGFELLOW (puzzled) Binge? MORROW Yes. I mean the real McCoy. Listen,  you play saloon with me, and I'll introduce  you to every wit, every nit-wit, and  every half-wit in New York. We'll go  on a twister that'll make Omar the soused  philosopher of Persia[7] look like an  anemic on a goat's milk diet. Longfellow saves him - once again -  from crashing over. 104. CLOSE SHOT - GROUP Featuring Longfellow. LONGFELLOW (vaguely) That ought to be fun. MORROW Fun? Say, listen, I'll take you on a  bender that will live in your memory  as a thing of beauty and joy forever. (to someone off) Boy! Boy! My headpiece! He exits from the scene. CAMERA FOLLOWING  HIM. MORROW (to the world in general) Oh, Tempora! Oh, Moeraes! Oh, Bacchus![8] He bumps into a woman, who glares at  him. WOMAN Oh, you're drunk. MORROW (unmindful) Oh, you're right. 105. CLOSEUP - BABE AND LONGFELLOW LONGFELLOW (to Babe) I guess if we go with him, we'll see  things, huh? ? 381 ? She looks up at his face, amazed at  his innocence. BABE Yes, I guess we will. FADE OUT: INT. MAC'S OFFICE 106. MED. SHOT Mac is reading the story, eyes sparkling.  Babe is sprawled in a chair, doing tricks  with a coin. MAC (reads) \"'I play the tuba to help me think.'  This is one of the many startling statements  made by Longfellow Deeds - New York's  new Cinderella Man - who went out last  night to prove that his uncle, the late  M.W. Semple - from whom he inherited  $20,000,000 - was a rank amateur in  the art of 'standing the town on its  cauliflower ear' . . . \"[9] He looks up. MAC Cinderella Man! That's sensational,  Babe! Sensational! BABE It took some high-powered acting, believe  me. MAC Did it? BABE I was the world's sweetest ingenue. MAC Is he really that big a sap? 107. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO Favoring Babe. BABE He's the original. There are no carbon  copies of that one. MAC Cinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag  on that hick that'll stick to him the  rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb's  face when he reads this? BABE If we could sell tickets, we'd make  a fortune. She covers the coin with palm of other  hand, and the coin disappears. But Mac  is too excited to pay any attention. MAC How'd you get the picture? ? 382 ? BABE Had the boys follow us. MAC Marvelous! (reads again) \"At two o'clock this morning, Mr. Deeds  tied up traffic while he fed a bagful  of doughnuts to a horse. When asked  why he was doing it, he replied: 'I  just wanted to see how many doughnuts  this horse would eat before he'd ask  for a cup of coffee.'\" (laughs) Beautiful! What happened after that? BABE I don't know. I had to duck to get the  story out. He was so far along he never  even missed me. MAC When're you going to see him again? BABE Tonight, maybe. (looks at her watch) I'll phone him at noon. (explaining) Oh, my lunch hour. I'm a stenographer,  you know. Mary Dawson. 108. MED. SHOT - THE TWO Favoring Mac. MAC (laughing) You're a genius, Babe - a genius! BABE I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment  - in case old snoopy Cobb might start  looking around. MAC (all excited) Good! Good! Stay there. Don't show your  face down here. I'll tell everybody  you're on your vacation. They'll never  know where the stories are coming from.  Stick close to him, Babe - you can get  an exclusive story out of him every  day for a month. We'll have the other  papers crazy. (starts for her) Babe, I could kiss you! 109. WIDER ANGLE BABE (sidestepping) Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's  vacation - with pay. MAC Sure. ? 383 ? BABE With pay! She is out the door. MAC (yelling after her) You'll get it, Babe. You'll get it. DISSOLVE TO: INT. LONGFELLOW'S BEDROOM 110. CLOSE SHOT Walter leans over the bed violently,  shaking Longfellow, who is lost in drunken  sleep. WALTER Mr. Deeds - Mr. Deeds, sir - you really  must get up. It's late! LONGFELLOW (without budging - without opening his  eyes) You're Walter, aren't you? WALTER Yes, sir. LONGFELLOW I just wanted to make sure. 111. CLOSE SHOT - WALTER He smiles. WALTER If you'll permit me to say so, sir,  you were out on quite a bender last  night, sir. 112. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW Longfellow opens one eye - and then  the other, blinking. As consciousness  returns to him, he glances around the  room as if to get his bearings. LONGFELLOW Bender? You're wrong, Walter. We started  out to a binge but we never got to it. 113. MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO Walter offers him a drink on a tray. WALTER (humoring him) Yes, sir. LONGFELLOW What's that? WALTER A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10] LONGFELLOW (slow to comprehend anything) Prairie? Oysters? ? 384 ? WALTER Yes, sir. It makes the head feel smaller. Longfellow takes it and downs it in  one swig. LONGFELLOW (his face finally reacting) Oh. Oh! (remembering) Has Miss Dawson called yet? WALTER Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson  has called, sir. LONGFELLOW She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't  let me help her. Got a lot of pride.  I like that. WALTER Oh, I do too, sir. LONGFELLOW I'd better call her up and apologize.  I don't remember taking her home last  night. WALTER I'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember  much of anything that happened last  night, sir. 114. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO Favoring Longfellow. LONGFELLOW What do you mean? I remember everything!  Hand me my pants - I wrote her phone  number on a piece of paper. WALTER You have no pants, sir. Longfellow looks up slowly. Walter goes  on: WALTER You came home last night - without them. LONGFELLOW (after a double take) I did what! WALTER As a matter of fact, you came home without  any clothes. You were in your - uh -  shorts. Yes, sir. LONGFELLOW Oh, don't be silly, Walter. I couldn't  walk around in the streets without any  clothes. I'd be arrested. WALTER That's what the two policemen said,  sir. ? 385 ? LONGFELLOW What two policemen? WALTER The ones who brought you home, sir.  They said you and another gentleman  kept walking up and down the streets,  shouting: \"Back to nature! Clothes are  a blight on civilization! Back to nature!\" Longfellow watches his face, fascinated.  Slowly it is all coming back to him. LONGFELLOW Listen, Walter, if a man named Morrow  calls up, tell him I'm not in. He may  be a great author, but I think he's  crazy. The man's crazy, Walter. 115. REVERSE ANGLE Favoring Walter. WALTER Yes, sir. By the way, did you Longfellow slowly swings out of bed  into a sitting position. Walter kneels  to put on Longfellow's slippers. Longfellow  balks, points, silently reminding Walter  that he has broken his promise not to  kneel down in front of him. LONGFELLOW (pointing) Please! WALTER But how'll I put on the slipper, sir? Longfellow's expression begs no disagreement.  Walter stands, fumbling with the shoes  from a stooped posture. WALTER (continuing) Yes, sir. I beg pardon, sir, but did  you ever find what you were looking  for, sir? LONGFELLOW Looking for? WALTER You kept searching me last night, sir.  Going through my pockets. You said you  were looking for a rhyme for Budington. LONGFELLOW (flatly) Better bring me some coffee, Walter. WALTER Very good, sir. (remembering) Oh, I beg pardon. A telegram came for  you, sir. (he hands the telegram to Longfellow) I'll get you some black coffee, sir. ? 386 ? 116. MEDIUM SHOT Following Walter's exit. Longfellow  quickly opens the telegram. His face  clouds. At this moment, Cobb comes bursting  into the room - a newspaper in his hand. COBB (wildly) Did you see all this stuff in the papers? LONGFELLOW (holding out telegram) Arthur wants to quit! COBB Arthur! Who's Arthur? LONGFELLOW He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow  Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit. COBB (he goes crazy) What do I care about Arthur! Did you  see this stuff in the paper? How'd it  get in there? What'd you do last night?  Who were you talking to? He flings the paper on the bed. Longfellow  glances at it, and his face clouds. COBB (while Longfellow reads) And what'd you do to those bodyguards?  They quit this morning. Said you locked  them up. LONGFELLOW Oh, they insisted on following me. 117. TWO SHOT COBB (wildly) What do you think bodyguards are for? LONGFELLOW (glances up) What do they mean by this - \"Cinderella  Man!\" COBB Are those stories true? 118. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW AND COBB Longfellow has his eyes glued on the  paper. LONGFELLOW I don't remember. \"Cinderella Man!\"  What do they mean by that? COBB They'd call you anything if you gave  them half a chance. They've got you  down as a sap. ? 387 ? LONGFELLOW (calmly) I think I'll go down and punch this  editor on the nose. COBB (quickly) No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking  people is no solution for anything. 119. TWO SHOT LONGFELLOW Sometimes it's the only solution. COBB Not editors. Take my word for it. Not  editors! LONGFELLOW If they're going to poke fun at me,  I'm going to COBB (bends over, earnestly) Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got  brains, kid. You'll get along swell  if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts  - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk  to anybody! These newshounds are out  gunning for you. LONGFELLOW (referring to paper) But what about this \"Cinderella Man\"? COBB That's my job. I'll take care of that.  I'll keep that stuff out of the papers  - if you'll help me. But I can't do  anything if you go around talking to  people. Will you promise me to be careful  from now on? LONGFELLOW Yes, I guess I'll have to. COBB (mopping his brow) Thank you. (as he goes) If you feel the building rock, it'll  be me blasting into this editor. 120. MED. SHOT He exits. During the scene Walter has  entered with a tray, which he has adjusted  on Longfellow's knee. LONGFELLOW Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody. BUTLER (entering) Miss Dawson on the phone, sir. ? 388 ? LONGFELLOW (alertly) Who? Miss Dawson? BUTLER Yes, sir. LONGFELLOW Fine. I'll talk to her. Give me the  phone, quick. She's the only one I'm  going to talk to from now on. As the butler scurries around for the  phone, DISSOLVE TO: EXT. TOP OF FIFTH AVENUE BUS - NIGHT  - (PROCESS) 121. CLOSE SHOT - BABE AND LONGFELLOW Longfellow looks around, absorbed. Babe  watches him. LONGFELLOW It's awfully nice of you to show me  around like this. BABE I enjoy it. LONGFELLOW The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in  New York, I'd go there every day. I'll  bet you do. BABE Well, I'd like to - but I have a job  to think of. EXT. STREET 122. MED. CLOSE SHOT - A TAXI Directly behind the bus. A man's head  is stuck out of taxi window. We recognize  it as one of the photographers, Bob. BOB (to driver) Hey, flap-ears![11] You better keep  following that bus! DRIVER'S VOICE Keep your shirt on! INT. THE TAXI - PROCESS 123. CLOSE SHOT - BOB AND FRANK Two photographers, with their equipment.  They keep their eyes glued on the bus  in front. They return to their seats. BOB It don't look as though we're gonna  get any pictures tonight. FRANK Babe ought to get him drunk again. ? 389 ? EXT. TOP OF BUS 124. CLOSE SHOT - BABE AND LONGFELLOW BABE Got any news (catches herself) I mean, has anything exciting been happening  lately? LONGFELLOW Sure. I met you. BABE (laughs) Oh. What's happening about the opera? LONGFELLOW Oh, that - well, we had another meeting.  I told them I'd go on being Chairman  if (explaining) I'm Chairman, you know. BABE Yes, I know. LONGFELLOW I told 'em I'd play along with them  if they lowered their prices - and cut  down expenses - and broadcast. BABE What did they say? LONGFELLOW Gosh, you look pretty tonight. BABE What did they say? LONGFELLOW Huh? Oh. They said I was crazy. Said  I wanted to run it like a grocery store. BABE What are they going to do? LONGFELLOW (leans over close to her) Do you always wear your hair like that? 125. WIDER SHOT At this point, two girls pass by, chattering.  One girl has a paper open. FIRST GIRL Isn't it a scream - \"Cinderella Man!\"  The dope! 2ND GIRL I'd like to get my hooks into that guy. ? 390 ? FIRST GIRL Don't worry. Somebody's probably taking  him for plenty. They are gone. Longfellow glares after  them. Babe is afraid to look up. LONGFELLOW (quietly) If they were men, I'd knock their heads  together. Babe is silent. Longfellow watches her  for a moment. 126. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO Favoring Longfellow. LONGFELLOW Have you seen the papers? BABE Uh-huh. LONGFELLOW That's what I like about you. You think  about a man's feelings. I'd like to  go down to that newspaper and punch  the fellow in the nose that's writing  that stuff 127. MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO She looks up, startled. LONGFELLOW \"Cinderella Man!\" I guess pretty soon  everybody will be calling me \"Cinderella  Man.\" Babe has had an uncomfortable time of  it - and quickly changes the subject. BABE Would you like to walk the rest of the  way? It's so nice out. LONGFELLOW Yes. BABE Yeah, let's. She jumps up from her seat, and Longfellow  follows. INT. THE TAXI 128. MED. CLOSE SHOT Favoring the taxi driver. DRIVER Hey, wise guys. He's getting off. This sets off a mad scramble. BOB AND FRANK (ad-lib) Hey, come on! ? 391 ? Pull over to the curb! DISSOLVE TO: EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE - GRANT'S TOMB 129. MED. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW AND  BABE He stands across the street from Grant's  Tomb, looking solemn. His eyes moist.  She is unaware of his emotion. BABE Come on, don't you want to see it? INT. THE TAXI 130. MED. SHOT - BOB AND FRANK FRANK Feast your eyes. Grant's Tomb! BOB Is that it? (to driver) Hey, beetle-puss! The Tomb! 131. MED. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW AND  BABE As they approach the monument. BABE There you are. Grant's Tomb. I hope  you're not disappointed. LONGFELLOW (throatily) It's wonderful. BABE To most people, it's an awful letdown. LONGFELLOW (in awe) Huh? BABE I say, to most people it's a washout. LONGFELLOW That depends on what they see. BABE (looks up at him) Now, what do you see? 132. CLOSEUP - LONGFELLOW LONGFELLOW Me? Oh, I see a small Ohio farm boy  becoming a great soldier. I see thousands  of marching men. I see General Lee with  a broken heart, surrendering, and I  can see the beginning of a new nation,  like Abraham Lincoln said. And I can  see that Ohio boy being inaugurated  as President (dreamily) Things like that can only happen in  a country like America. ? 392 ? 133. CLOSEUP - BABE To intercut with above speech. During  his recital, she watches his face, fascinated.  Her impulse is to laugh, but she finds  that she can't. LONGFELLOW (overcome - he almost chokes on his  final words) Excuse me! FADE OUT: INT. PRIVATE OFFICES 134. MED. CLOSE SHOT A switchboard operator fielding calls. SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR Sorry, Mr. Hopper. Mr. Cedar won't answer  his phone. Sorry. OFFICE CLERK (passing by) Say, what's going on in the boss's office? SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR Search me. The three 'Cs' and little  'B' have been in there for over an hour. INT. CEDAR'S PRIVATE OFFICE 135. FULL SHOT Cedar paces the floor. His brothers  look worried. Budington is enthroned  at Cedar's desk. BUDINGTON I don't want to be critical, John, but  here it is CEDAR (pouncing on him) Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we  haven't got the Power of Attorney yet! BUDINGTON Yes, but you said CEDAR (walking way from him) I don't care what I said. I can't strangle  him, can I! FIRST BROTHER It's ridiculous for us to have to worry  about a boy like that. (crosses to desk) Look at these articles about him! \"Cinderella  Man!\" Why, he's carrying on like an  idiot. BUDINGTON Exactly what I was saying to my wife  when this FIRST BROTHER Who cares what you were saying to your  wife? ? 393 ? There is a moment's awkward silence.  The silence is broken by the buzzing  of the dictograph. Cedar crosses to  it and snaps the button. 136. CLOSE SHOT AT DESK As secretary's voice comes over dictograph: CEDAR Yes? SECRETARY'S VOICE Mr. and Mrs. Semple are still waiting. CEDAR (irritated) I can't help it. Let them wait! He snaps the dictograph off. 137. MED. SHOT GROUP FIRST BROTHER Those people have been in to see me  every day this week. 2ND BROTHER Who are they ? CEDAR (dismissing it) Relatives of old man Semple. FIRST BROTHER They keep insisting they should have  some nuisance value. CEDAR Nuisance value? FIRST BROTHER They say if it hadn't been for Deeds,  they'd have gotten all the money. CEDAR (suddenly) Nuisance value. (thinks a minutes - crosses to door) Maybe they have! Maybe they have! Maybe  they have! (opens door) Mr. and Mrs. Semple, please. How do  you do? The others all stand around - as the  Semples enter. MRS. SEMPLE We've been trying to 138. MED. CLOSE SHOT - CEDAR AND THE  SEMPLES CEDAR (smoothly cutting her off) I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting.  How are you, sir? I don't know what  my secretary could ? 394 ? have been thinking to keep you waiting  this long. (to one of his brothers) Will you bring the chairs? Quickly.  Will you have a cigar, Mr. Semple? MR. SEMPLE Thanks. Semple takes the cigar - rather flabbergasted  at all the sudden attention showered  upon him. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. ROOF OF TALL BUILDING - NIGHT 139. MED. SHOT - LONGFELLOW AND BABE From over their shoulders, looking down  on the lights and teeming activity of  Times Square. BABE There's Times Square. LONGFELLOW You can almost spit on it, can't you? BABE Why don't you try? He does try. The wind blows it back  on him. She laughs, takes out a handkerchief  and wipes it off his coat. BABE (as she wipes) Oh! It's breezy up here. He doesn't say anything right away. BABE You're worried about those articles  they're writing about you, aren't you? LONGFELLOW I'm not worrying any more. I suppose  they'll go on writing them till they  get tired. You don't believe all that  stuff, do you? A guilty look spreads over Babe's face. BABE Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers,  you know. LONGFELLOW Yeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is  why people seem to get so much pleasure  out of hurting each other. Why don't  they try liking each other once in a  while? An awkward pause. BABE Shall we go? ? 395 ? DISSOLVE TO: EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT 140. MED. TRUCKING SHOT As Babe and Longfellow walk. BABE (spotting a park bench) Here's a nice place. LONGFELLOW Yeah. Anyway, there aren't any photographers  around. EXT. PARK - BEHIND SOME BUSHES 141. MEDIUM SHOT Bob and Frank, sneaking around in the  bushes. 142. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW AND BABE BABE You know, you said something to me when  you first met me that I've thought about  a great deal. LONGFELLOW What's that? BABE You said I was a lady in distress. LONGFELLOW Oh, that BABE What did you mean by that? LONGFELLOW Nothing There is a pause. LONGFELLOW Have you got a - are you - uh - engaged  or anything? 143. CLOSEUP - BABE The corners of her mouth go up in sympathetic  amusement. BABE No. Are you? LONGFELLOW'S VOICE No. BABE You don't go out with girls very much,  do you? LONGFELLOW'S VOICE I haven't. BABE Why not? ? 396 ? 144. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO Favoring Longfellow. LONGFELLOW Oh, I don't know. BABE You must have met a lot of swell society  girls since you've been here. Don't  you like them? LONGFELLOW I haven't met anybody here that I like,  particularly. They all seem to have  the St. Vitus Dance.[12] (awkwardly) Except you, of course. (a pause) People here are funny. They work so  hard at living - they forget how to  live (thoughtfully; leans back) Last night, after I left you, I was  walking along and looking at the tall  buildings and I got to thinking about  what Thoreau said. They created a lot  of grand palaces here - but they forgot  to create the noblemen to put in them. 145. REVERSE ANGLE Favoring Babe. She stares at him curiously. LONGFELLOW I'd rather have Mandrake Falls. BABE I'm from a small town too, you know. LONGFELLOW (interested) Really? BABE Probably as small as Mandrake Falls. LONGFELLOW (finding a kindred soul) Gosh! What do you know about that! Babe leans her head back in a reminiscent  mood. We get a feeling that, for the  moment, she has forgotten she is Babe  Bennett, out on a story. BABE Ah, it's a beautiful little town, too.  A row of poplar trees right along Main  Street. Always smelled as if it just  had a bath. 146. MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO Longfellow watches her face intently. BABE I've often thought about going back. ? 397 ? LONGFELLOW You have? BABE Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun  there when I was a little girl. I used  to love to go fishing with my father.  That's funny. He was a lot like you,  my father was. Talked like you, too.  Sometimes he'd let me hold the line  while he smoked - and we'd just sit  there for hours. And after awhile, for  no reason, I'd go over and kiss him  and sit in his lap. He never said very  much but once I remember him saying:  \"No matter what happens, honey, don't  complain.\" LONGFELLOW He sounds like a person worth while  knowing. There is a pause while Longfellow watches  her, and she is lost in thought. BABE (continuing) He played in the town band, too. LONGFELLOW He did? I play the tuba BABE Yeah, I know. LONGFELLOW What did he play? BABE The drums. He taught me to play some. LONGFELLOW He did? BABE Yes. I can do \"Swanee River.\" Would  you like to hear me? LONGFELLOW (enthusiastically) Sure! 147. MEDIUM SHOT She picks up a couple of branches. With  the two sticks she drums on the bench  seat - and sings \"Swanee River.\" When she is finished, though clearly  delighted, he shows her a long face  of mock-disappointment. BABE Oh, I suppose you could do better. LONGFELLOW Sure. I can sing \"Humoresque.\" ? 398 ? BABE \"Humoresque\"? I'll bet you don't even  know how it goes. LONGFELLOW Sure. Look! You sing it over again,  and I'll do \"Humoresque\" with you. BABE It had better be good. She starts again, and he sings \"Humoresque\"  in counterpoint to her drumming. CUT TO: EXT. PARK - BEHIND SOME BUSHES 148. CLOSE SHOT - BOB AND FRANK They wait with their camera. When they  hear the singing, they look up, and  then at each other in surprise. BOB I wonder if they'd want to make it a  quartet. FRANK Shhh! 149. MEDIUM SHOT Longfellow and Babe. They are having  a grand time with their singing. A policeman  saunters into the scene and stands watching  them for a few seconds, without their  being conscious of his presence. He  smiles, shakes his head and passes on  out of scene. Over the shot we hear  the low moan of a siren in the distance. 150. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO They reach the climax of their song  - and laugh joyously. At this moment,  the shrieking of the siren is nearer  and louder. Longfellow looks up quickly.  Excited, he jumps up and runs toward  street. Babe looks up, surprised. LONGFELLOW (as he runs off) Fire engine! Fire engine! I want to  see how they do it. Wait for me, will  you? 151. CLOSE SHOT - BOB AND FRANK BEHIND  BUSHES Frank grabs the camera. FRANK Looks like the evening is not going  to be wasted! 152. MEDIUM SHOT They dash by the policeman, who looks  up, startled. 153.

It contains  a paper upon which the following is  typed: \"CINDERELLA MAN FIRE-EATING DEMON\" \"Longfellow Deeds, 'The Cinderella Man,'  last night threw a 'defy' into the teeth  of the New York Fire Department, that  when it comes to extinguishing conflagrations  - they had better look to their laurels\" CAMERA PULLS BACK and we find Babe,  staring at the sheet of paper in front  of her. Her eyes have a distant look. 157. FULL SHOT Several feet away from her Mabel Dawson  stands in front of an easel, working  silently on a painting. She dabs at  it and turning, pauses a moment to watch  Babe, who at the moment rests her forehead  on the typewriter carriage. MABEL (softly) What's the matter, hon? BABE (quickly) Nothing. Babe is too much absorbed to hear this.  Getting no response, Mabel turns and  studies her for a few seconds. MABEL What's up, Babe? Something's eating  you. BABE No. It's nothing. MABEL My unfailing instinct tells me something's  gone wrong with the stew. BABE (murmuring) Don't be ridiculous. ? 400 ? She again resumes her typing. Mabel  crosses to her and looks over her shoulder. MABEL You haven't gotten very far, have you?  That's where you were an hour ago. Come  on, let's knock off and go down to Joe's.  The gang's waiting for us. BABE (jumping up) I can't write it, Mabel! I don't know  what's the matter with me. Babe lights a cigarette. Mabel studies  her. MABEL (quietly) Uh-huh. I think I can tell you. The phone bell rings. Mabel picks it  up. 158. CLOSE SHOT AT PHONE MABEL (into phone) Hello . . . (listens) Yes, she's here. Who wants her? (listens) Who? (listens) Oh, yes.

(listens) Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to  say things - so I write 'em. CONTINUATION SCENE 160 BABE (touched) I'd like to read it some time. She listens for a moment, apparently  moved by his sweetness. CONTINUATION SCENE 161 LONGFELLOW Maybe I'll have it finished next time  I see you. (listens) Will I see you soon?

CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO MABEL (knowingly) Uh-huh. ? 402 ? BABE I'm crucifying him. MABEL People have been crucified before. BABE Why? Why do we have to do it? MABEL You started out to be a successful newspaper  woman, didn't you? BABE Yeah, then what? MABEL (shrugging) Search me. Ask the Gypsies. BABE Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh.  To us he looks like a freak. You know  what he told me tonight? He said when  he gets married he wants to carry his  bride over the threshold in his arms. MABEL The guy's balmy. BABE Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried  to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in  my throat. MABEL Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get  me thinking about Charlie again. BABE He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know  what that is? MABEL Huh? BABE No - of course you don't. We've forgotten.  We're too busy being smart-alecks. (sits at her typewriter) Too busy in a crazy competition for  nothing.

LONGFELLOW What do you mean by coming in here when  I'm playing? WALTER But she's on the telephone LONGFELLOW Get out. (pointing) The evil finger's on you. Get out! Walter hurries out. Longfellow jumps  up and chases him down the grand staircase.  Longfellow stops at the top of the stairs,  struck by an idea. INT. GRAND STAIRCASE 165. WIDE ANGLE Showing Walter at the bottom of the  stairs and Longfellow at the top. LONGFELLOW Stop! Walter halts. Longfellow gives a shout  from the top of the stairs. There is  a discernible echo. LONGFELLOW Hey, did you hear that? WALTER What, sir? ? 404 ? Longfellow gives another shout. There  is another echo. He tries it again -  louder. Another echo. It is all very  satisfactory. WALTER (pleased) Why, that's an echo, sir! LONGFELLOW You try it. WALTER (timidly) Me, sir? LONGFELLOW (an order) Yeah. Walter gives a bird-like hoot. There  is an echo. LONGFELLOW (firmly) Louder. Walter gives a louder hoot. And louder.  Each time, an echo. A butler in a bathrobe emerges to see  what all the hullabaloo is about. Longfellow  spots him. LONGFELLOW (to butler) You try it. BUTLER Me, sir? But the butler clearly relishes the  opportunity. He gives a little high-pitched  squeak. LONGFELLOW Louder! The butler tries it again - much better.  Another man-servant has emerged. Longfellow  points to him. LONGFELLOW You try it! The man-servant tries it - very raspy,  another tone altogether. LONGFELLOW (waving like a conductor) All together! A symphony of hoots, shrieks, barks  and echoes. LONGFELLOW Again! The household staff do it again. ? 405 ? LONGFELLOW (surveying the scene - then, dramatically) Let that be a lesson to you. With that, Longfellow spins on his heel  and returns to his bedroom. There is a pause. The butler takes command  of the other two. BUTLER (gesturing imperiously) Go back to your room, both of you! Walter and the man-servant hasten to  exit. The butler waits until nobody is looking,  then gives one, final hoot. He murmurs  to himself with satisfaction as he exits. DISSOLVE TO: EXT.

Where is he? I'm just dying to see the \"Cinderella  Man.\" CAMERA MOVES SWIFTLY among groups of  people picking out vignettes of conversation.  Longfellow is the hot topic. A husband and a wife whispering: A HUSBAND Shh! - he may hear you. A WIFE Even if he heard you, he wouldn't understand. A man and a woman gossiping: A MAN I hear he still believes in Santa Claus. A WOMAN Will he be Santa Claus? That's what  I want to know. Another man holding forth to two elegantly-dressed  women: ANOTHER MAN Have you all got your slippers ready  for the \"Cinderella Man\"? ? 406 ? WOMEN (ad-lib) Yes, I have. Everybody laughs.

FULL SHOT Babe is listlessly packing her few things  in a small handbag. She slowly and meticulously  folds a silken undergarment, wrapping  it in tissue. Her eyes have a distant  look. Mabel watches her, concerned.  There is a long pause before either  of them speaks. MABEL (breaking the silence) You're a fool, Babe. BABE I just couldn't stand seeing him again. MABEL Running away is no solution. 169. MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO Babe is unresponsive. MABEL (after a pause) What'll I tell him if he calls up? BABE Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I  got a job in China - some place. MABEL You're acting like a school girl. BABE (suddenly - tensely) What else can I do? Keeping this up  is no good. He's bound to find out sometime.

FRANK (reaching for a bottle) Just one little drink - and then we're  ready to shoot. MABEL (grabbing it away) Just a minute. No, you don't. BABE We're not going out tonight.

BABE You threw them out! 182. CLOSER SHOT MABEL You mean (gesturing with hands) by the neck or something? LONGFELLOW Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw  'em out. Mabel raises her eyebrows. LONGFELLOW I guess that'll be in the papers tomorrow.  It will give 'em something else to laugh  at. 183. CLOSEUP - BABE Her face clouds - miserably. LONGFELLOW'S VOICE (lightly) I don't mind though. I had a lot of  fun doing it. BABE (quickly) Would you like to go for a walk? 184. MED. CLOSE SHOT LONGFELLOW Yes, if it isn't too late. BABE (going to bedroom) I'll get my hat. She disappears, leaving Mabel and Longfellow  again staring at each other, self-consciously.  Mabel smiles, ill-at-ease. ? 410 ? LONGFELLOW Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't  it? - isn't it? MABEL (tremulously) Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice  weather lately. LONGFELLOW (after a pause) It would be a nice night to go for a  walk, don't you think? MABEL Oh yes, I think it'd be a swell night  to go for a walk. A nice long one. 185. CLOSE SHOT - BEHIND SOFA Bob and Frank, holding their breaths. 186. MEDIUM SHOT Babe comes out of bedroom. BABE Ready? LONGFELLOW Gosh, she looks better every time I  see her. BABE (vaguely) Thank you. She crosses to the door. LONGFELLOW (to Mabel) Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep  her out late. MABEL Thank you so much. Good night. They exit. Mabel sighs relievedly. The  boys jump from their crouching positions. FRANK (wobbling forward) Ow! My foot's asleep! BOB (grabbing camera) Come on - let's go! Frank grabs his camera and both bolt  toward the door. Mabel gets there one  step ahead of them, and blocks their  path. MABEL No, you don't. Just a minute. No more  photographs. ? 411 ? DISSOLVE TO: EXT. FRONT OF BABE'S HOME 187. CLOSE TRUCKING SHOT As they walk slowly down the front steps.

CLOSE TRUCKING SHOT As they walk along a foggy street, on  their faces. LONGFELLOW Mary, I'm going home. BABE Are you? When? LONGFELLOW In a day or so, I think. BABE I don't blame you. 189. CLOSE TWO SHOT Continuing on them, as they slowly walk  around the block. LONGFELLOW A man ought to know where he fits in.  I just don't fit in around here. I once  had an idea I could do something with  the money, but they kept me so busy  here, I haven't had time to figure it  out. I guess I'll wait till I get back  home. There is a long pause. Both lost in  their own thoughts. LONGFELLOW Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary?  You don't have to pay any attention  to me. BABE No, I don't mind. LONGFELLOW All my life, I've wanted somebody to  talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always  used to talk to a girl. BABE A girl? LONGFELLOW Oh, an imaginary one. I used to hike  a lot through the woods and I'd always  take this girl ? 412 ? with me so I could talk to her. I'd  show her my pet trees and things. Sounds  kind of silly but we had a lot of fun  doing it. (smiling) She was beautiful. (then moodily) I haven't married 'cause I've been kinda  waiting. You know, my mother and father  were a great couple. I thought I might  have the same kind of luck. I've always  hoped that some day that imaginary girl  would turn out to be real. They have arrived back at the front  steps of Babe's home. LONGFELLOW Well, here we are again. BABE Yes, here we are again. (after a pause) Good night. LONGFELLOW (then, quickly - his voice faltering) Mary - I - excuse me 190. CLOSE TWO SHOT Favoring Babe. She cuts him off, her  voice shaking. BABE Goodbye, darling. Don't let anybody  hurt you again - ever. They can't anyway.  You're much too real. You go back to  Mandrake Falls. That's where you belong  - goodbye! 191. WIDER ANGLE She runs up the steps. LONGFELLOW Mary She stops and turns. He walks up close  to her. 192. CLOSER SHOT - THE TWO LONGFELLOW You know the poem I told you about?  It's finished. His hand goes to his breast pocket -  and then slowly is withdrawn - without  bringing out the poem. LONGFELLOW Would you like to read it? It's to you. BABE (scarcely audible) Yes, of course. He now takes the poem out. The paper  is folded. He hands it to her and she  slowly unfolds it. Just as she is about  to read Longfellow lays a hand on her  arm. ? 413 ? LONGFELLOW (a little frightened) You don't have to say anything, Mary.  You can tell me tomorrow what you think. She looks into his eyes, but does not  respond. Then she holds the paper up  and begins reading. Longfellow watches  her anxiously. 193. CLOSEUP - BABE Reading softly: BABE \"I tramped the earth with hopeless beat  - Searching in vain for a glimpse of  you. Then heaven thrust you at my very  feet, A lovely angel - too lovely to  woo.\" The last words come with difficulty.  Babe's eyes are slowly welling up. 194. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO Babe continues reading: BABE \"My dream has been answered, but my  life's just as bleak, I'm handcuffed and speechless in your  presence divine - For my heart longs to cry out, if it  only would speak, 'I love you, my angel - be mine, be  mine.' \" Her voice is choked when she finishes.  She does not look up until she refolds  the paper. He stands close to her, waiting  expectantly. Finally, she glances up.  Her cheeks are moist, and her face clouded.  Impulsively, she throws her arms around  his neck, kissing him. BABE Oh, darling! Longfellow's arms encircle her and for  a few moments they remain in an emotional  embrace. LONGFELLOW (huskily) You don't have to say anything now.  I'll wait till tomorrow - till I hear  from you. 195. CLOSEUP - BABE Her eyes are beset with fears. She loves  him - but knows how hopeless it all  is. She slowly starts freeing herself  from his embrace. 196. MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO As Babe, weeping softly, frees herself  from his embrace. Longfellow gives a yelp of joy and leaps  down the steps. He trips over a garbage  pail and bumps into passersby, making  a racket as he zigzags down the street  and out of scene. ? 414 ?

BABE (after a pause) Last night he proposed to me. MAC Proposed to you! You mean he asked you  to marry him? BABE Yes. MAC (alert) Why, Babe - that's terrific!

Funny twist, isn't it? MAC (suddenly) Say, you haven't gone and fallen for  that mug, have you? ? 415 ? Babe's silence is eloquent. MAC Well, I'll be He places an arm tenderly around her  shoulder. MAC That's tough, Babe. Babe smiles wryly. MAC (interested) What're you going to do? BABE (walking away) I'm going to tell him the truth. MAC Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him  you've been making a stooge out of him? BABE I'm having lunch with him today. He  expects an answer. It's going to be  pretty. MAC You're crazy! You can't do that! 199. MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO Over their shoulders, from behind, as  Mac comforts her. BABE He'll probably kick me right down the  stairs. I only hope he does. MAC I'll put you on another job. You need  never see him again, eh? BABE That's the rub. MAC Oh, as bad as that, huh? BABE (far-away) Telling him is the long shot - I'm going  to take it. He watches her sympathetically. Babe  sighs resignedly. BABE (looking around) Well, it was fun while it lasted, Mac.  I'll clean out my desk. She leaves him. Mac is deeply moved  by her problem. ? 416 ? DISSOLVE TO: INT.

The pate  de fois gras, sir. LONGFELLOW Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it  because she likes it. BUTLER Yes, sir. The other butler returns with a small  bowl of flowers which he places in the  center of the table. LONGFELLOW Now you got the idea. Fine. He sits in one of the chairs and leans  forward in an imaginary conversation  with Babe - his lips move but we hear  nothing. LONGFELLOW (motions to butler) Sit over there, will you? BUTLER Me sir? LONGFELLOW Yes. The butler sits. LONGFELLOW Yes. You're too tall. Slink lower, will  you? The butler does it. LONGFELLOW More. Now forward. They are practically nose to nose over  the flowers.

I don't  mind you making a sap out of yourself  - but you made one out of me, too. LONGFELLOW (to Walter - merrily) Will you tell the gentleman I'm not  in? COBB Mary Dawson, huh? Mary Dawson, my eye.  That dame took you for a sleigh ride  that New York will laugh about for years.  She's the slickest, two-timing, double-crossing At the mention of the name, Longfellow  turns for the first time. 205. CLOSEUP - LONGFELLOW His face goes livid, as Cobb's voice  continues: LONGFELLOW (between clenched teeth) What are you talking about? ? 419 ? 206. MEDIUM SHOT Longfellow has started out toward him.  In two long strides, Longfellow has  grabbed Cobb by the shirt-front, ready  to strangle him. COBB All right. Go ahead. Sock away, and  then try to laugh this off. With his free hand, he reaches into  his coat pocket. He unrolls a newspaper.  Longfellow shifts his glance over to  the photograph in the newspaper Cobb  holds up, and slowly his grip on Cobb  relaxes. He takes the newspaper. 207. CLOSEUP - LONGFELLOW As he looks at the picture. INSERT: PICTURE OF BABE BENNETT Under which is the following: \"Louise (Babe) Bennett - wins Pulitzer  Prize for reportorial job on Macklyn  love triange.\" BACK TO SCENE Longfellow stares long and unbelievingly  at the picture. 208.

His face is a dead mask,  every illusion shattered. Slowly, a  wry smile appears on his face and, rising,  he wanders around the room in deep abstraction.  Cobb and Walter watch him sympathetically. Longfellow is silent a long time. 216. MEDIUM SHOT As a butler enters. BUTLER I beg pardon, sir. Shall I serve the  wine with the squab, sir? Longfellow doesn't hear him. BUTLER (tries again) I beg pardon, sir. 217. CLOSEUP - COBB His face softens. COBB If I knew you were going to take it  so hard, I woulda kept my mouth shut.  Sorry. 218. MEDIUM SHOT As finally Longfellow speaks, without  turning. LONGFELLOW (quietly) Pack my things, Walter. I'm going home. WALTER Yes, sir. He immediately busies himself. DISSOLVE TO: INT. CORRIDOR 219. WIDE SHOT Longfellow emerges from his bedroom,  walking briskly toward the staircase,  immediately followed by Cobb and Walter.  Walter is loaded down with suitcases.  Longfellow is wearing coat and hat. COBB (trying to keep up with Longfellow) You shouldn't be running away like this.  What's going to happen to the Estate? LONGFELLOW They can have the Estate. ? 422 ? As they approach the staircase, a commotion  is heard from stairs. Cobb hurries ahead  to see what is going on. INT. GRAND FOYER 220. MEDIUM SHOT Two butlers are struggling with a wild-eyed  man of middle age. They shout in unison. BUTLERS (simultaneously) FARMER You can't come up here! Let me go! I wanna see him! He's not home, I tell you! I wanna see that guy! We'll send for the police! Let me go! They continue to struggle as Cobb reaches  them. COBB What's going on here? The man yanks himself free. FARMER There he is! I just wanted to get a  look at him. He sees Longfellow over Cobb's shoulder. FARMER There you are! I just wanted to see  what kind of a man you were! He struggles to thrust Cobb aside. 221. FULL SHOT Favoring Longfellow, who has reached  the bottom of the staircase and watches  the man warily. FARMER (wildly) I just wanted to see what a man looks  like that can spend thousands of dollars  on a party - while people around him  are hungry! The \"Cinderella Man,\" huh?  Did you ever stop to think how many  families could have been fed on the  money you pay out to get on the front  pages? Cobb forcibly restrains the man. COBB Come on! Take him out of here! FARMER Let me go! LONGFELLOW (an order) Let him alone. FARMER Let me alone! (threateningly) If you know what's good for you - you'll  let me get this off my chest! ? 423 ? (to Longfellow) How did you feel feeding doughnuts to  a horse? Get a kick out of it, huh?  Got a big laugh? (sarcastically) Did you ever think of feeding doughnuts  to human beings! No! Longfellow stares at him. WALTER (quietly) Shall I call the police, sir? LONGFELLOW No! (to man) What do you want!! FARMER Yeah - that's all that's worrying you.  What do I want? A chance to feed a wife  and kids! I'm a farmer. A job! That's  what I want! LONGFELLOW A farmer, eh! You're a moocher, that's  what you are! I wouldn't believe you  or anybody else on a stack of bibles!  You're a moocher like all the rest of  them around here, so get out of here! FARMER Sure - everybody's a moocher to you.  A mongrel dog eating out of a garbage  pail is a moocher to you! COBB (starting to push him towards the door) This won't do you any good The man shoves him away, suddenly whips  out a gun and levels it at him. FARMER Stay where you are, young feller. Get  over there. Cobb backs away and the man points the  gun at Longfellow, who remains staring  at him, immobilely. FARMER (tensely) You're about to get some more publicity,  Mr. Deeds! You're about to get on the  front page again! See how you're going  to like it this time! (voice rises) See what good your money's going to  do when you're six feet under ground.  You never thought of that, did you?  No! All you ever thought of was pinching  pennies - you money-grabbing hick! You  never gave a thought to all of those  starving people ? 424 ? (his voice wavers) standing in the bread lines (huskily) not knowing where their next meal was  coming from! Not able to feed their  wife and kids. (voice breaks) Not able to He can't go on. A sob escapes. He reaches  up and brushes away a tear with a rough  hand. It seems to bring him to his senses.  He glances down and seeing the gun in  his hand - stares at it in surprise.  He realizes what he was about to do. FARMER (scarcely audible) Oh! 222. MED. SHOT - THE GROUP The man slumps into a chair and the  gun drops to the floor. Cobb bends quickly  and picks it up. Longfellow never moves. FARMER (dead voice - staring into space) I'm glad I didn't hurt nobody. Excuse  me. He turns his head slowly and peers at  them with non-seeing eyes, then suddenly  he hides his face in his hands and sobs. FARMER (muffled) Crazy. You get all kinds of crazy ideas. Longfellow watches him pityingly. FARMER Sorry. I didn't know what I was doing. The rest of it seems to come out of  him effortfully - his voice breaking. FARMER Losing your farm after twenty years'  work - seeing your kids go hungry -  a game little wife saying \"Everything's  going to be all right.\" (stridently) Standing there in the bread lines. It  killed me to take a handout. (pathetically) I ain't used to it. (resigned) Go ahead and do what you want with me,  mister. (scarcely audible) I guess I'm at the end of my rope. He sobs openly. While he was speaking,  Longfellow was peering into the man's  face intently. As the man finishes DISSOLVE TO: EXT. INTIMATE DINING ROOM 223. CLOSE SHOT At the table that was all set for Babe.  The man sits, eating. He seriously bends  over his food. Longfellow sits opposite  him - his eyes glued on the man, absorbed  in profound thought. ? 425 ?

On one  side and leading out into the hall,  is a long line of men waiting to be  interviewed. VOICE Go on. Step lively. 226. MED. SHOT At Longfellow's desk. He has a two days'  growth of beard and looks worn. Next  to him is a clerk. In front of him is  an applicant. LONGFELLOW (as the camera moves in on him) Are you married? APPLICANT Yes, sir. LONGFELLOW Any children? ? 426 ? APPLICANT No, no children. LONGFELLOW All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll  qualify.

WIDER ANGLE As the farmer in previous sequence approaches. FARMER Here's the order for the plows. We got  a good price on them. LONGFELLOW That's fine. Thanks. I'll look 'em over  later. FARMER Oh, Mr. Deeds Longfellow looks up. Farmer goes on: ? 427 ? FARMER my wife wanted me to tell you she (hesitates) she prays for you every night.

INT. CEDAR'S OFFICE 230. MEDIUM SHOT Cedar behind his desk. In front of him  is Henry Semple and his nagging wife.  Cedar shoves a paper in front of Semple. CEDAR We have very little time. He's ordered  me to turn everything over to him immediately.  We have to work fast before he disposes  of every penny. WIFE See! I told you something could be done.  I knew it all the time. Sign it, dear. SEMPLE (hesitating) We may get into trouble. WIFE Oh, don't be so squeamish. CEDAR There are millions involved. After all,  you have your legal rights. You're his  only living relatives. 231. CLOSE SHOT AT DESK As Semple picks up the paper. SEMPLE What's it say? WIFE That's your agreement with Mr. Cedar,  if we win. ? 428 ? CEDAR You see, my end is going to be rather  expensive. I have a lot of important  people to take care of. I have the legal  machinery all set and ready to go. I've  been working on nothing else for the  last week. You say the word, and we'll  stop this yokel dead in his tracks. WIFE Sign it! SEMPLE Oh, all right. With the perturbed expression still  on his face, Semple reaches over to  sign the document. Simultaneously, Cedar  flicks a button on his dictagraph. CEDAR (into dictagraph) Charlie, we're off! Papers all set? VOICE All set. CEDAR Okay, then. Go to it. (afterthought) And, Charlie VOICE Yeah? CEDAR Find out who wrote those newspaper articles  and subpoena them right away. VOICE Okay. DISSOLVE TO: INT. LONGFELLOW'S DRAWING ROOM 232. MEDIUM SHOT A large, raw-boned Swede stands before  Longfellow. LONGFELLOW What is your name? SVENSON Christian Svenson. LONGFELLOW Farmer? SVENSON Yes, ma'am. LONGFELLOW Where is your farm? SVENSON South Dakota north. ? 429 ? LONGFELLOW South Dakota - north? SVENSON South Dakota - but on the top. LONGFELLOW Oh. Oh! 233. WIDER ANGLE Cobb enters, very businesslike. COBB What about your knocking off for lunch? LONGFELLOW Not hungry. I want to get through this  work in a hurry, and then I want to  go home. What price did you get on those  trucks? COBB Come on, come on. What are you trying  to do, kid? Keel over? You haven't been  out of this house in two weeks. LONGFELLOW (tired) Well, maybe I will have a sandwich. (to Swede) Do you mind waiting a few minutes? SVENSON (undoing paper package) Oh, sure, sure. If you like to have  a sandwich, I can give you one, please. He brings out two huge sandwiches, and  hands one to Longfellow. LONGFELLOW (smiling) Thanks. Thank you. Never mind, Cobb. He takes it, and he and the Swede silently  eat. Longfellow looks up. LONGFELLOW Good. The Swede smiles. Longfellow nibbles  his sandwich, then glances around the  room. His gaze rests on: 234. LONG SHOT Of the long line of applicants waiting  for an audience. 235. MEDIUM SHOT LONGFELLOW (calls to Cobb) Cobb! Get lunch for the rest of them. ? 430 ? COBB (entering) What? There must be 2000 of them out  there. LONGFELLOW Well, that doesn't make 'em any less  hungry. COBB Okay, Santa Claus. 2000 lunches. He exits. Longfellow glances over at  the line, smiling. 236. FULL SHOT In front of the line there is a slight  scuffle, as a man is being pushed forward  by some others. He mumbles a protest,  tries to get back into position, but  the men push him forward again. GROUP (ad-lib) Go on, say something. Say something! 237. CLOSEUP - LONGFELLOW He looks up inquiringly. 238. MED. CLOSE SHOT - MEN IN LINE The man finally is resigned, and stands  shifting, ill-at-ease, his head hanging  bashfully. MAN Mr. Deeds, the boys here wanted me to  say a little something. They just wanted  me to say that (clears his throat) Well, they wanted me to say that (quickly gets it out) We think you're swell - and that's no  baloney. MAN'S VOICE Say something more! 239. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW He smiles self-consciously. 240. MED. CLOSE SHOT OF MEN The spokesman apparently has not finished  yet. Directly behind the line, three  officious-looking men have made their  appearance and wait for him to conclude. MAN Give me a chance, fellas. We're all  down and out - but when a fellow like  you comes along, kinda gives us a little  hope - and they just wanted me to say It's as far as he gets - as the three  strangers break their way through the  line and approach Longfellow's desk. ONE OF THE SHERIFFS (ad-lib) Break it up. 241. MED. SHOT AT DESK FIRST DEPUTY SHERIFF (pointing to Longfellow) That's him. ? 431 ? 2ND DEPUTY SHERIFF Are you Longfellow Deeds? LONGFELLOW (looks up) Yes? FIRST DEPUTY SHERIFF Sheriff's office. (shows paper) We've got a warrant to take you into  custody. LONGFELLOW (without moving) A what? FIRST DEPUTY SHERIFF A warrant for your arrest. You'll have  to come along with us. Cobb enters. COBB What's up? What do you mugs want? FIRST DEPUTY SHERIFF I don't know nothing, buddy. All I know  is the Sheriff gives me an insanity  warrant to execute. COBB Insanity! Who's says he's insane? They all turn to Charlie, who comes  forward. CHARLIE The complainant is a relative of the  late Martin Semple. The charges are  that Mr. Deeds is insane and incapable  of handling the Estate. COBB Oh, somebody got panic-stricken about  his giving his dough away, eh? (to sheriff) Where do you think you're going to take  him? FIRST DEPUTY SHERIFF To the County Hospital. CHARLIE Of course, that's only temporary. A  hearing will follow immediately. 242. CLOSEUP - LONGFELLOW As he speaks quietly. LONGFELLOW That's fine. Just because I want to  give this money to people who need it,  they think I'm crazy. (cynically) That's marvelous. That makes everything  complete. ? 432 ? 243. WIDER ANGLE To include group. FIRST DEPUTY SHERIFF Let's get going! COBB Wait a minute! Not so fast. We're going  to get a lawyer. I'll call Cedar. LONGFELLOW (thoroughly disillusioned) No, don't bother. CHARLIE As a matter of fact, I'm from Mr. Cedar's  office. He represents the complainant. COBB Oh. Longfellow glances up at him and smiles  bitterly. FIRST DEPUTY SHERIFF Well, let's go. We're wasting a lot  of time. He goes to one side of Longfellow, and  his partner to the other. They take  Longfellow by the arms. He glances down  casually and, suddenly, violently pushes  the deputies away from him. They are  thrown backward; their eyes widen in  surprise. LONGFELLOW (calmly rising) All right, I'll go. But get your hands  off me! 244. MEDIUM SHOT Longfellow starts to walk forward, accompanied  by Cobb - and the two deputies and Charlie  fall in behind them. THE SHERIFFS (ad-lib) Make way! Make way! 245. CLOSE SHOTS OF CLERKS To be intercut with above scene. They  stare, petrified, and mumble to each  other. 246. MEDIUM SHOT Of the farmers and other applicants.  The line has fallen out and they stand  in a bunch, staring pathetically and  hopelessly at the departing group. 247. CLOSEUP OF THE FARMER Who stands in f.g. of bunch. What is  taking place has slowly penetrated his  befuddled brain. The disappointment  he feared is here. His body imperceptibly  sags, his eyes dim - all hope having  gone out of them.

The guard hurriedly hangs  up and stands to block her. GUARD Sorry, lady (recognizes her) Oh, it's you again. BABE Oh, please! I've got to see him. GUARD Now listen, sister, for the fourteenth  and last time he don't want to see nobody. BABE (pleading) Will you just give him my name? GUARD (confidentially) Listen, toots, just between us, there  ain't a thing in the world the matter  with that guy till I mention your name,  then he goes haywire! Babe winces under the blow. INT. HOSPITAL ROOM 249. MEDIUM SHOT Longfellow is seated by the far wall,  peering moodily out the window. Cobb  paces about. Suddenly, he wheels on  Longfellow. COBB What are you going to do - just sit  back and let them railroad you? It's  as pretty a frameup as ever hit this  rotten town! If you'd just let me get  you a lawyer! Longfellow pays no attention to him. 250. MED. CLOSE SHOT As Cobb continues. COBB (raises his voice) You can't walk into that courtroom without  being ready to protect yourself in the  clinches. Cedar's too smart. With the  array of talent he's got lined up against  you - you're cooked! ? 434 ? Longfellow is still unresponsive. Cobb  thinks a moment, watching him studiously;  then pleading tenderly: COBB Listen, pal - I know just how you feel.  A blonde in Syracuse put me through  the same paces. I came out with a sour  puss - but full of fight. Come on, you  don't want to lay down now. Longfellow is still unresponsive. COBB Do you realize what's happening? They're  trying to prove that you're nuts! If  they win the case, they'll shove you  in the bughouse. The moment they accuse  you of it, they have you half licked.  You've got to fight! Longfellow disregards him and Cobb sighs,  resignedly. INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE DOOR 251. MED. CLOSE SHOT The guard is reading his paper. Babe  is still waiting, pacing. GUARD Go on, sit down, won't you? 252. MED. CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR As Cobb comes out. The guard gets up  to check the door is locked. GUARD So long, Mr. Cobb. Cobb, in a troubled frame of mind, doesn't  respond and starts down corridor - CAMERA  TRUCKS WITH HIM. Babe catches up with  him. BABE Corny! Cobb doesn't stop. Babe grabs his arm: BABE Corny! Cobb stops. 253. CLOSE TWO SHOT Cobb glares at Babe belligerently. BABE I've got to see him! I've got to talk  to him! COBB Haven't you done enough damage already? BABE (ignoring his attack) Somebody's got to help him! He hasn't  got a chance against Cedar. Look, I've  been all over town talking to everybody.  I've got Mac all lined up - and the  paper's behind him. And I can get him  Livingston, too. With a lawyer like  Livingston, he's got a fighting chance. ? 435 ? COBB (coldly) You're wasting your time. He doesn't  want any lawyers. He's sunk so low,  he doesn't want help from anybody. (bitterly) You can take a bow for that. (huskily) As swell a guy as ever hit this town,  and you crucified him! For a couple  of stinking headlines! You've done your  bit - now stay out of his way!

She stares, expression-less. Mac  glances at her sympathetically. 258. MED. SHOT Featuring the farmer who broke into  Longfellow's house. Near him is the  Swede we saw - and others. ? 436 ? 259. SHOT INSIDE RAILING Cedar and his assistants arrange their  papers. Two dignified gentlemen, psychiatrists,  await action, arms folded.

COBB (full of excitement) Cedar just sent for me. Wants to make  a settlement. Here's your chance to  get out of the whole mess. What do you  say? He gets no response from Longfellow. There is a stir in the courtroom. 266. MED. LONG SHOT The bailiff calls out as the Judge proceeds  to his bench. BAILIFF Quiet, please! The Supreme Court of  the State of New York, County of New  York, is now in session, the Honorable  John May, Judge, presiding. Be seated. 267. MED. CLOSE SHOT To include Judge and Longfellow. JUDGE The court wishes to warn those present  that it will tolerate no disturbances. (to Longfellow) Regarding the sanity hearing of Longfellow  Deeds, are you represented by counsel,  Mr. Deeds? ? 437 ? Almost imperceptibly, Longfellow shakes  his head no. The Judge looks troubled.  There is a stir in the courtroom. JUDGE I understand that you have no counsel,  Mr. Deeds. In fact, that you have no  intention of defending any of these  charges. Now, if you wish to change  your mind, the hearing can be postponed. Getting no response from Longfellow,  the Judge shrugs his shoulders. JUDGE Proceed. DISSOLVE TO: INT. COURTROOM 268. MEDIUM SHOT Cedar is on his feet. CEDAR (addressing the court) and in the interests of my client,  the only other living relative of the  late Martin W. Semple, we cannot permit  a fortune so huge to be dissipated by  a person whose incompetency and abnormality  we shall prove beyond any reasonable  doubt. 269. PANNING SHOT OF SPECTATORS CEDAR'S VOICE I have before me a series of articles  written by a newspaper woman who was  an eye-witness to his conduct ever since  he came to New York. CAMERA STOPS on Babe and Mac. Cedar's  voice goes on: CEDAR She tells how, in the midst of a normal  conversation, he would suddenly begin  playing his tuba. She tells of his attacks  upon several of our eminent writers  - for no apparent reason. In fact, there  are many instances not recorded in these  articles in which Mr. Deeds satisfied  an unnatural desire to smash people  up without provocation. 270. MED. SHOT - FRONT OF COURTROOM CEDAR I, myself, unable to keep pace with  his mental quirks, and constantly fearful  of assault, turned down an opportunity  to represent him as his attorney. This  newspaper woman, whom we have subpoenaed  to testify, tells how he tied up traffic  for an hour feeding doughnuts to a poor  horse. And by his own statement, waiting  for that horse to ask for a cup of coffee. ? 438 ? There is laughter in the courtroom -  which quickly subsides when the Judge  pounds his gavel. CEDAR We have photographs to substantiate  this little episode, and other photographs  showing Mr. Deeds jumping upon a fire  engine. This scarcely sounds like the  action of a man in whom the disposition  of twenty million dollars may safely  be entrusted. This writer of these articles  - a woman whose intelligence and integrity  in the newspaper world is unquestioned  - held him in such contempt that she  quite aptly named him \"The Cinderella  Man.\" 271. CLOSEUP - LONGFELLOW CEDAR'S VOICE We have witnesses here from Mandrake  Falls, his own home town, who will tell  of his conduct throughout his lifetime,  proving that his derangement is neither  recent nor a temporary one. Longfellow's interest is only slightly  aroused. He lifts his eyes in a casual  glance around him. 272. MED. CLOSE SHOT Featuring Cedar. CEDAR We have others who will tell of his  unusual behavior when he invited the  great leaders of the musical world to  his home, and then proceeded to forcibly  eject them. Only recently when he was  in the County Hospital for observation,  he not only refused to be examined by  these gentlemen, the state psychiatrists,  but he actually made a violent attack  upon them. 273. CLOSE SHOT - THE JUDGE As Cedar continues talking, CAMERA PULLS  BACK to WIDER SHOT. CEDAR In these times, with the country incapacitated  by economic ailments, and endangered  with an undercurrent of social unrest,  the promulgation of such a weird, fantastic  and impractical plan as contemplated  by the defendant, is capable of fomenting  a disturbance from which the country  may not soon recover. It is our duty  to stop it! Our government is fully  aware of its difficulties and can pull  itself out of its economic rut without  the assistance of Mr. Deeds, or any  other crackpot. 274. MED. PANNING SHOT Of farmers, the Swede and others. CEDAR'S VOICE His attempted action must therefore  be attributed to a diseased mind afflicted  with hallucinations of grandeur, and  obsessed with an insane desire to become  a public benefactor. ? 439 ? 275. CLOSE SHOT AT FRONT OF COURTROOM Featuring Cedar. CEDAR (suddenly) Your Honor, at this time, we would like  to call our first witness: Miss Louise  - Babe - Bennett. 276. FULL SHOT There is a mild stir, and all wait expectantly  for Babe to appear. CLERK Miss Bennett, please. Babe, eyes on Longfellow, slowly walks  to the stand. 277. CLOSEUP - LONGFELLOW He has his face averted and doesn't  look at her. 278. MEDIUM SHOT Babe continues to rivet her eyes on  Longfellow, as she is sworn in. CLERK Raise your right hand, please. She does so. CLERK Do you solemnly swear the testimony  you may give before this court to be  the truth, the whole truth and nothing  but the truth, so help you God? BABE I do. CLERK State your right name, please. BABE Louise Bennett. CLERK Take the stand. 279. MED. CLOSE SHOT AT WITNESS STAND As Cedar steps up to question Babe.  Judge in f.g. CEDAR Miss Bennett, are you employed by the  Morning Mail? There is no answer. Babe continues to  stare off at Longfellow, hoping he will  look up. Cedar speaks to her again: CEDAR I must ask you to direct your attention  to me. But Babe's attention remains focused  on Longfellow. BABE (appealing to Judge) Your Honor, this is ridiculous! ? 440 ? JUDGE Please answer the questions. BABE (wildly) The whole hearing's ridiculous! That  man's no more insane than you are. The suddenness of her outbreak is startling.  The Judge pounds his gavel. 280. WIDER ANGLE - FRONT OF COURTROOM The Judge pounding his gavel. JUDGE Miss Bennett please! CEDAR This is outrageous! BABE (rising to stand) It's obviously a frameup! They're trying  to railroad this man for the money they  can get out of him! CEDAR Your Honor! The Judge pounds his gavel throughout  her speech. JUDGE (highly) Young lady, another outburst like that  and I shall hold you in contempt! We're  not interested in your opinion of the  merits of this case. You're here to  testify. Sit down and answer the questions.  Proceed. Cedar beams victoriously. CEDAR Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed  by the Morning Mail? BABE (sharply) No! Cedar's eyes widen in surprise. There  is a light stir. CEDAR (threateningly) You are under oath, Miss Bennett. I  ask you again - are you employed by  the Morning Mail? BABE (irritably) No! I resigned last week! 281. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW As Cedar proceeds without interruption. ? 441 ? CEDAR'S VOICE Well, prior to that time - were you  employed by the Morning Mail? BABE'S VOICE (laconically) Yes. 282. CLOSE SHOT AT WITNESS STAND - BABE  AND CEDAR CEDAR Were you given an assignment to follow  the activities of Longfellow Deeds? BABE Yes. CEDAR Did you subsequently write a series  of articles about him? BABE Yes! CEDAR (holding them up) Are these the articles? BABE Yes! CEDAR Were you present when all these things  took place? BABE Yes! CEDAR Are they true! BABE NO!! CEDAR But they did take place? BABE They're colored! Just to make him look  silly! CEDAR And you saw them happen? BABE Yes, but I CEDAR (preemptorily) That's all, Miss Bennett. BABE (half shrieking) It isn't all! I'd like to explain ? 442 ? CEDAR (brusquely) That's all, Miss Bennett. That's all. 283. MEDIUM SHOT A bailiff takes Babe by the arm. BAILIFF Come on, miss - come on! CEDAR (simultaneously, to Judge) Your Honor, I'd like to submit these  articles as evidence. Babe struggles away from the bailiff. BABE (frantically) Let go of me! (steps up to Judge; wildly) What kind of hearing is this? What are  you trying to do - persecute the man?  He's not defending himself. Somebody's  got to do it! Throughout her tirade, the Judge has  been angrily pounding his gavel. JUDGE Miss Bennett, please! 284. CLOSER SHOT Featuring Babe and Judge. BABE I've got a right to be heard! I've attended  dozens of cases like this. They're usually  conducted without any formality at all.  Anybody can be heard! My opinion is  as good as these quack psychiatrists.  I know him better than they do. JUDGE Miss Bennett, if you have quite finished,  I should like to inform you that one  more utterance from you and I shall  place you under arrest. (leans back) I'm willing to hear anything anyone  has to say - but I insist on it being  done in an orderly fashion. When you  have learned to show some respect for  this court, you may return. (dismissing her) Until then, you'd better go back to  your seat and calm down. BAILIFF This way, miss. 285. WIDER ANGLE As Babe is led away, there is another  courtroom stir. BAILIFF'S VOICE Order in the court! ? 443 ? When Babe is out of sight, the Judge  turns to Longfellow. JUDGE Mr. Deeds, have you anything to say  in defense of these articles? 286. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW AND COBB Longfellow shakes his head. Cobb glances  to him helplessly. 287. CLOSE SHOT - JUDGE He shrugs. JUDGE Mr. Deeds? (again no reply) Mark these Exhibit A for the plaintiff. CLERK Yes, Your Honor. JUDGE Proceed. 288. CLOSE SHOT - BABE As she sits down beside Mac - who places  an affectionate arm around her shoulders. DISSOLVE TO: 289. MED. SHOT - FRONT OF COURTROOM Two old ladies are being led to the  witness stand. Their eyelids flutter  excitedly as they go. 290. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW He looks up, sees the old ladies and  smiles at them friendily. 291. MED. CLOSE SHOT AT JUDGE'S BENCH Against the drone of the clerk, who  swears witnesses in: CEDAR The Falkner sisters are rather timid,  Your Honor, and wish to be together.  If the court pleases, I will only have  one of them testify. JUDGE (impatiently) Yes! Yes! Let's get on with it. Cedar turns to them. 292. MED. CLOSE SHOT AT WITNESS STAND As Cedar addresses one of the old ladies. CEDAR What is your name, please? JANE Jane Falkner. This is my sister, Amy. AMY (agreeing) Yes - Amy. ? 444 ? CEDAR I'll direct my questions to you, Miss  Jane. You can answer for both. Do you  know the defendant, Mr. Longfellow Deeds? The two old ladies look at each other,  then in the direction in which Cedar  points. JANE Oh yes, yes - of course we know him. CEDAR (a little nervously) How long have you known him? Jane turns to her sister, and they whisper  to each other. JANE (turns to Cedar) Since he was born. AMY Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife. JANE He was a seven-months baby. CEDAR Thank you, that's fine. Do you see him  very often? The two old ladies have their whispered  conference again. JANE Most every day. AMY Sometimes twice. JUDGE (irascibly) Must we have the echo? CEDAR Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane.  Now, will you tell the Court what everybody  at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds? The two old ladies consult each other  once more. JANE They think he's pixilated. AMY Oh yes, pixilated. JUDGE (leaning forward) He's what? CEDAR (concerned) What was that you said he was? ? 445 ? JANE Pixilated. AMY Uh-huh. CEDAR (patiently) Now, that's a rather strange word to  use, Miss Jane. Can you tell the court  exactly what it means? While the two ladies go into a huddle: 293. CLOSE SHOT - PSYCHIATRISTS As one of them speaks up. PSYCHIATRIST Perhaps I can explain, Your Honor. The  word pixilated is an early American  expression - derived from the word 'pixies,'  meaning elves. They would say, 'The  pixies had got him,' as we nowadays  would say a man is 'balmy.' 294. MEDIUM SHOT The Judge nods his understanding. The  Falkner sisters nod in pleasant agreement.  Cedar sighs victoriously. CEDAR Is that correct? JANE Uh-huh. AMY Uh-huh. JUDGE Now tell me, why does everyone think  he's - uh - pixilated? Does he do peculiar  things? 295. MED. SHOT TOWARD WITNESS STAND JANE (after conferring with Amy) He walks in the rain, without his hat,  and talks to himself. AMY Sometimes he whistles. JANE And sings. CEDAR Anything else? JANE Recently he gave Chuck Dillon a thumping. AMY Blacked his eye. ? 446 ? CEDAR And why? JANE For no reason, I guess. He always does  it. We always run into the house when  we see him coming. AMY Never can tell what he's going to do. JANE He sure is pixilated. AMY Oh, yes - he's pixilated all right. CEDAR Thank you, ladies. That's all. Cedar beams. The old ladies leave to  resume their seats. DISSOLVE TO: 296. CLOSE SHOT IN WITNESS STAND A policeman in uniform. POLICEMAN They kept hollering: \"Back to Nature!  Back to Nature!\" I thought they looked  harmless enough so I took them home.  I never thought he was cracked. WIPE OFF TO: 297. CLOSE SHOT IN WITNESS STAND The waiter at \"Tullio's.\" WAITER I'm a waiter. He kept pressing me to  point out the celebrities, and so help  me Hannah I'm coming out of the kitchen  a coupla minutes later and there he  is moppin' up the floors with them.  I never figured he was a guy looking  for trouble. WIPE OFF TO: 298. CLOSE SHOT IN WITNESS STAND Mme. Pomponi. MME. POMPONI (expostulating) He threw us out bodily! But bodily! WIPE OFF TO: 299. MED. CLOSE SHOT IN WITNESS STAND Of one of the bodyguards on witness  stand. BODYGUARD We was hired as his bodyguard, see?  Well, the first crack out of the box,  he throws us in a room and locks the  door, see? Now, if a thing like that  gets around in our profession, we'd  get the bird - see? So I says to my  partner, \"Let's quit this guy, he's  nuts!\" ? 447 ? WIPE OFF TO: 300. CLOSE SHOT IN WITNESS STAND A Cockney cabman. CABMAN I'm very fond of Clara, sir. She's a  nice 'orse. And when this bloke 'ere  started feedin' 'er doughnuts, I yelled  down to him, \"Mind what you're doin'  down there! Mind what you're doing'!\"  Of course I wouldn't mind, sir, but  Clara won't eat nothin' but doughnuts,  now. WIPE OFF TO: 301. WIDE SHOT[13] Of one of the photographers (Bob) and  enlarged photographs of Longfellow's  antics. BAILIFF'S VOICE Come to order. CEDAR Your Honor, I wish to call your attention  to these exhibits. Mr. Davis, do you  recognize these reproductions? BOB Sure, they're good enlargements. Where'd  you have them made? CEDAR Did you make the originals of them? BOB Sure. I took the originals. Taking pictures  is my business. I photograph a lot of  nuts. WIPE OFF TO: As Cedar speaks. CEDAR And now, Your Honor, if the court pleases,  I shall call upon Dr. Emil Von Holler,  if he will be good enough to give us  his opinion. Dr. Von Holler, as you  know, is the eminent Austrian psychiatrist  - probably the greatest authority on  the subject in the world. At present  he is in this country on a lecture tour,  and has graciously volunteered his services.  Dr. Von Holler? While he is still speaking, VOICE OF BAILIFF Dr. Von Holler! ? 448 ? DISSOLVE TO: 302. WIDER ANGLE As the clerk finishes swearing Dr. Von  Holler in. CLERK Do you solemnly swear the testimony  you are about to give in the cause now  pending before this court shall be the  truth, the whole truth and nothing but  the truth, so help you God? State your  right name, please. VON HOLLER (a slight Austrian accent) Emil Von Holler. CLERK Take the stand. 303. MED. CLOSE SHOT AT WITNESS STAND On Von Holler and Cedar. CEDAR Now Dr. Von Holler, will you kindly  tell the court what your opinion is  on this case? VON HOLLER This is purely a case of manic depression.  In cases of this kind, patients sometimes  go on for years before being detected. He turns to one of the psychiatrists,  sitting with the Judge. VON HOLLER You remember, Dr. Fosdick, in my last  book there are some very fine examples. DR. FOSDICK (nodding) Uh-huh. VON HOLLER Especially, the one of the young nobleman,  you remember? DR. FOSDICK Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler.  Very interesting. VON HOLLER It reminds me very much of this one.  Nicht wahr? DR. FOSDICK Ja. VON HOLLER It takes so long to detect them (to Judge) because their mood changes so often  and so quickly. Now, Your Honor, may  I show you? May I use the chart? ? 449 ? JUDGE By all means. He moves to a blackboard. There are  chalk marks on it. A straight line runs  diagonally across the center. Other  lines run zig-zag over and below this  center line. VON HOLLER (indicating chart) Below here, they are extremely depressed,  melancholy, impossible to live with,  and often become violent. (running a line up) From this mood the manic depressive  might gradually change until they reach  this state. (he reaches the center line) Here is lucidity. Here they are perfectly  normal. As normal as you or I (smiling) assuming, of course, that we are normal. (he starts up with chalk) Then, the mood changes again until (chalk reaches top) they reach this state, a state of highest  exaltation. Here everything is fine.  Here the world is beautiful. Here they  are so elated - how do you express it? (quickly, as it comes to him) they would give you the shirt off their  backs! CEDAR Dr. Von Holler, how would you say that  applied to Mr. Deeds's case? VON HOLLER The symptoms are obvious. (points to top line) When he was here, on top of the wave,  he felt nothing but kindliness and warmth  toward his fellow-men. He wanted them  around him. So he decided he would give  a big reception. But in the meantime,  his mood has changed. (chalk goes down) He is now at the bottom of the wave  - depressed - melancholy. So, when his  guests arrive, he throws them out. They  are now his imaginary enemies. 304. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW As Von Holler's voice continues: VON HOLLER'S VOICE Other instances of high elation are  when he plays his tuba, when he writes  his poetry, when he chases fire engines  in his desire to help humanity. This  is contrasted with his present mood,  which is so low that even the instinct  for self-preservation is lacking. 305. MED. SHOT FRONT OF COURTROOM Von Holler still continues: VON HOLLER Oh, the man is verrukt. Your Honor,  this is decidedly a case of a manic  depressive. ? 450 ? CEDAR Thank you, Dr. Von Holler. Dr. Von Holler returns to his seat. CEDAR Your Honor, we rest. 306. FULL SHOT - COURTROOM There is a shifting of bodies, and a  renewed interest, as they wait for the  next move. The Judge and his own two  experts go into an inaudible huddle. 307. CLOSE SHOT - COBB AND LONGFELLOW Longfellow is slumped in his seat, head  down. COBB Come on, what're you going to do? Let  them get away with it? They got you  cooked. Longfellow does not budge. There is an expectant stir in the courtroom  among the spectators and rows of reporters. 308. MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE JUDGE AND  HIS EXHIBITS Judge comes out of his huddle and glances  at Longfellow. JUDGE (leaning forward) Mr. Deeds, before the court arrives  at a decision, isn't there anything  you wish to say? 309. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW AND COBB Longfellow shakes his head slightly. COBB (whispering) Come on - don't be a sap! CONTINUATION SCENE 308 The Judge watches him a few moments,  hesitatingly, and then turns to his  experts. 310. MED. SHOT - NEWSPAPER REPORTERS A REPORTER He's sunk. 311. CLOSE SHOT - CEDAR AND HIS CLIENTS,  ASSISTANTS ETC. They smirk confidently. 312. CLOSE SHOT - BABE AND MAC She stares, panic-stricken. 313. MED. SHOT Of the Swede, the farmer, and others.  Their faces show their resentment. 314. MED. SHOT FRONT OF COURTROOM JUDGE (to the two experts) You both concur? ? 451 ? EXPERTS (ad-lib) Oh, positively. The Judge emerges from his consultation  with his experts and addresses Longfellow. JUDGE Mr. Deeds, in view of the extensive  testimony and your continued silence  and upon recommendation of the doctors,  the Court considers it advisable for  your own safety that you be committed  to an institution as prescribed by law.  You need medical attention, Mr. Deeds. (shrugs) Perhaps in a little while Suddenly the air is rent with the shrill  voice of Babe. BABE No! No! No! Wait a minute! All are startled and look up. Babe runs  right to the Judge. BABE You can't do it! You've got to make  him talk. CEDAR'S VOICE Your Honor, I object! She turns directly to Longfellow - leaning  over close to him. 315. CLOSE SHOT - BABE AND LONGFELLOW BABE (pleading softly) Oh, darling, please. I know everything  I've done. I know how horrible I've  been. No matter what happens, if you  never see me again, do this for me. JUDGE'S VOICE Miss Bennett, please! BABE (frantically) You said I could speak! You said I could  have my say if I were rational. I'm  rational. Please, let me take the witness  chair. 316. WIDER ANGLE BABE He must be made to defend himself before  you arrive at a decision. JUDGE Very well. Take the stand. Babe goes up to the witness stand and  sits down. BABE Oh, thank you! ? 452 ? CEDAR (shouting) Your Honor, what she is saying has no  bearing on the case. I object. JUDGE Let her speak. BABE I know why he won't defend himself!  That has a bearing on the case, hasn't  it? He's been hurt! He's been hurt by  everybody's he met since he came here,  principally by me. He's been the victim  of every conniving crook in town. The  newspapers pounced on him - made him  a target for their feeble humor. 317. CLOSE SHOT - BABE BABE I was smarter than the rest of them!  I got closer to him so I could laugh  louder. Why shouldn't he keep quiet?  Every time he said anything it was twisted  around to sound imbecilic. 318. CLOSEUP - BABE As she continues. BABE He can thank me for it! I handed the  gang a grand laugh. This is a fitting  climax to my sense of humor. 319. WIDER ANGLE As Cedar protests. CEDAR But Your Honor - this is preposterous! The Judge waves him down with a dismissing  gesture of his hand. BABE Certainly I wrote those articles. I  was going to get a raise - and a month's  vacation! But I stopped writing them  when I found out what he was all about!  When I realized how real he was. 320. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW As Babe's voice continues: BABE'S VOICE He could never fit in with our distorted  viewpoint because he's honest and sincere  - and good. If that man is crazy, Your  Honor, the rest of us belong in straight-jackets. 321. MED. SHOT Cedar jumps up. CEDAR Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's  obviously in love with him. ? 453 ? BABE What's that got to do with it? CEDAR (shouting) Well, you are in love with him, aren't  you? BABE (shouting back) What's that got to do with it? CEDAR (louder) You are , aren't you? BABE (just as loud) Yes!!! 322. CLOSEUP - LONGFELLOW To be intercut during her speech. At  first he merely glances up at her speculatively.  Finally, he begins to show some interest. 323. MED. SHOT FRONT OF COURTROOM Cedar turns to the Judge. CEDAR Your Honor, her testimony is of no value.  Why shouldn't she defend him? It's a  tribute to American womanhood - the  instinct to protect the weak. I'm not  saying that nobody likes the boy. I  cherish a fond affection for him myself.  But that doesn't mean to say In the middle of his speech, Mac - the  editor - appears at his elbow. MAC When the windbag here gets through,  Your Honor, I'd like to verify what  Miss Bennett said. I'm her editor. When  she quit her job, she told me what a  swell fellow this man was. And anything  Babe Bennett says is okay with me. JUDGE If you have anything to say, you will  take the stand. MAC I've already said it, Your Honor. I  just thought I'd like to get my two  cents in. As he starts to go, CAMERA PANNING WITH  HIM, he passes Longfellow. He nudges  him. MAC Don't be a sucker, pal. Stand up and  speak your piece. He disappears to his seat. COBB Your Honor, I've got a couple of cents  I'd like to put in ? 454 ? JUDGE Sit down! COBB I've been with this man ever since he  came to New York 324. MED. SHOT Shooting toward the Judge. He pounds  his gavel, interrupting Cobb. JUDGE Sit down! There will be no further interruptions. Almost simultaneously with the Judge's  speech, the farmer, somewhere in the  audience, rises to his feet. FARMER How about us, Mr. Deeds! 325. MED. SHOT Shooting toward audience. As the farmer  finishes, a dozen others are on their  feet. CROWD (ad-lib) Yes! What about us, Mr. Deeds! You're not going to leave us out in  the cold! They're trying to frame you, Mr. Deeds! The turmoil is general, with bailiffs  running to quiet them. The Judge pounding  his gavel, incensed. BAILIFF'S VOICE Order! Order! JUDGE (when quiet reigns) In the interest of Mr. Deeds, I have  tolerated a great deal of informality.  But if there is one more outburst, I  shall have the courtroom cleared. LONGFELLOW Your Honor JUDGE (surprised) Yes? LONGFELLOW I'd like to get in my two cents' worth. JUDGE Take the stand! There is a general stir of excitement  - and whispering. 326. CLOSE SHOT - BABE Her eyes sparkle happily. ? 455 ? 327. CLOSE SHOT - CEDAR AND CLIENTS The clients look up at Cedar, concerned.  Cedar comforts them with a confident  grimace. 328. MED. SHOT To include Longfellow, Judge, and others  around them. Longfellow hesitates. JUDGE Proceed. LONGFELLOW Well, I don't know where to begin. There's  been so many things said about me that  I 329. CLOSE SHOT AT WITNESS STAND Longfellow continues: LONGFELLOW About my playing the tuba. Seems like  a lot of fuss has been made about that.  If a man's crazy just 'cause he plays  the tuba, then somebody better look  into it, 'cause there are a lot of tuba  players running around loose. Of course,  I don't see any harm in it. I play mine  whenever I want to concentrate. That  may sound funny to some people - but  everybody does something silly when  they're thinking. For instance, the  Judge here is an O-filler . . . 330. WIDER ANGLE Front of courtroom. JUDGE A what? LONGFELLOW An O-filler. You fill in all the spaces  in the O's, with your pencil. (points to desk) I was watching you. The Judge looks down at a paper in front  of him. INSERT: OF A PRINTED DOCUMENT Of some sort. All the O's and P's and  R's have the white spaces pencilled  in. 331. CLOSEUP - JUDGE As he looks up from the document. He  is a trifle self-conscious. Laughter  comes from the courtroom. LONGFELLOW'S VOICE That may make you look a little crazy,  Your Honor, just sitting around filling  in O's - but I don't see anything wrong  'cause that helps you to think. Other  people are doodlers. JUDGE Doodlers? ? 456 ? 332. MED. SHOT - FRONT OF COURTROOM LONGFELLOW That's a name we made up back home for  people who make foolish designs on paper  when they're thinking. It's called doodling.  Almost everybody's a doodler. Did you  ever see a scratch pad in a telephone  booth? People draw the most idiotic  pictures when they're thinking. Dr.  Von Holler, here, could probably think  up a long name for it, because he doodles  all the time. Dr. Von Holler, who is in the middle  of some doodling, flinches. A roar of  laughter comes from the spectators.  Longfellow reaches over to where Dr.  Von Holler sits and picks up a piece  of paper. LONGFELLOW (to Dr. Von Holler) Thank you. (returning to the stand) This is a piece of paper he was scribbling  on. (scrutinizes it) I can't figure it out. One minute it  looks like a chimpanzee - and the next  minute it looks like a picture of Mr.  Cedar. (hands it to him) You look at it, Judge. The Judge, with a serious mien, takes  the paper. INSERT: OF PAPER It is a doodle face. BACK TO SCENE: Dr. Von Holler is somewhat uncomfortable. LONGFELLOW Exhibit A - for the defense. (after a pause) Looks kind of stupid, doesn't it, Your  Honor? But I guess that's all right  if Dr. Von Holler has to doodle to help  him think. That's his business. Everybody  does something different. Some people  are (demonstrates) ear-pullers - some are nail-biters (pointing) That Mr. Semple over there is a nose-twitcher. 333. CLOSE SHOT - SEMPLE AND HIS WIFE He looks up, startled, his nose twitching  more violently than ever. The courtroom  rocks with laughter. His wife, in her nervousness, pulls  at her fingers. LONGFELLOW'S VOICE And the lady next to him is a knuckle-cracker. Mrs. Semple quickly drops her hands  in her lap, as the courtroom again fills  with laughter. ? 457 ? 334. CLOSE SHOT - COBB He swings a key-ring around his forefinger.  Suddenly he realizes Longfellow might  get to him, and he hastily palms the  keys and shoves them in his pocket. 335. MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEWSPAPER REPORTERS One is leaning forward, listening intently  - biting the end of his pencil. The  one next to him nudges him and silently  points to the pencil in his mouth. The  reporter gets the idea and, smiling  sheepishly, yanks it out of his mouth. 336. MED. CLOSE SHOT - FRONT OF COURTROOM LONGFELLOW So you see, everybody does silly things  to help them think. (in conclusion) Well, I play the tuba. 337. CLOSE SHOT - MAC As he bursts forth. MAC Nice work, toots! The crowd echoes him with shouts and  laughter. 338. CLOSE SHOT - JUDGE He glares off scene at Mac, reprimandingly. 339. CLOSE SHOT - BABE She is amused at the embarassment Longfellow  has caused them all. 340. CLOSE SHOT - CEDAR AND HIS CLIENTS They squirm uncomfortably. 341. MED. CLOSE SHOT AT WITNESS STAND Longfellow in chair - Judge at bench,  b.g. JUDGE Mr. Deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting  people from your home? LONGFELLOW Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those  people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi  told the truth. I did throw them out  because I didn't want the party in the  first place. I didn't invite anybody.  Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just  came to see what kind of a freak the  \"Cinderella Man\" was. I don't know how  people like that are supposed to act,  Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman  is an example, I'll stick to simple  folks. She just came in, talked my ear  off, and took charge of everything.  If I were a friend of hers, I'd have  her examined. 342. MED. SHOT OF COURTROOM Featuring Longfellow. Cedar, who cannot  stand it any longer, jumps to his feet. ? 458 ? CEDAR Your Honor, this is becoming farcical.  I demand that Mr. Deeds dispense with  side remarks and confine himself to  facts! Let him explain his wanderings  around the streets in underclothes,  his feeding doughnuts to horses! JUDGE'S VOICE Proceed. LONGFELLOW Mr. Cedar's right. Those things do look  kind of bad, don't they? But to tell  the truth, Your Honor, I don't remember  them. I guess they happened, all right,  because I don't think a policeman would  lie about a thing like that, but I was  drunk. It was the first time I was ever  drunk in my life. It's probably happened  to you, some time. I mean, when you  were younger, of course. The Judge clears his throat in embarrassment.  Several women giggle. The Judge sternly  pounds his gavel. 343. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW LONGFELLOW It's likely to happen to anybody. Just  the other morning I read in the paper  about Mr. Cedar's own son - about how  he got drunk and insisted on driving  a taxi-cab, while the driver sat inside.  Isn't that so, Mr. Cedar? Isn't that  so , Mr. Cedar? 344. MED. SHOT OF COURTROOM All eyes have turned to Cedar. 345. CLOSE SHOT - CEDAR His eyes are beginning to blaze angrily. CEDAR Your Honor, I object. JUDGE Proceed. 346. MEDIUM SHOT LONGFELLOW Now about the Falkner sisters. That's  kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar  going all the way to Mandrake Falls  to bring them here. Do you mind if I  talk to them? JUDGE Not at all. Longfellow turns. Everybody stretches  to get a better look at them. LONGFELLOW Jane, who owns the house you live in? ? 459 ? 347. CLOSE SHOT - THE SISTERS The girls consult with each other. JANE Why, you own it, Longfellow. AMY Yes, you own it. LONGFELLOW'S VOICE Do you pay any rent? JANE (after conferring with Amy) No, we don't pay any rent. AMY Good heavens, no! We never pay rent. 348. WIDER ANGLE As Longfellow continues questioning: LONGFELLOW Are you happy there? JANE Oh, yes. AMY Yes, indeed. LONGFELLOW Now, Jane, a little while ago you said  I was pixilated. Do you still think  so? JANE (after the usual conference) Why, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow. AMY Always. LONGFELLOW (smiling) That's fine. I guess maybe I am. (seriously) Now tell me something, Jane. Who else  in Mandrake Falls is pixilated? Jane turns to her sister and this time  they go into a prolonged huddle. It  is apparently a difficult thing to figure  out. Finally they come out of it. JANE Why, everybody in Mandrake Falls in  pixilated - except us. AMY Uh-huh. 349. MED. SHOT OF SPECTATORS There is an outburst of laughter which  the Judge quickly quells with his gavel. ? 460 ? 350. MED. SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE LONGFELLOW Now, just one more question. Do you  see the Judge here? He's a nice man,  isn't he? JANE & AMY Uh-huh. LONGFELLOW Do you think he's pixilated? JANE (quickly) Oh, yes. AMY Yes, indeedy. There is more laughter. More pounding  of the judiciary gavel. 351. CLOSE SHOT - CEDAR He feels his case slowly crumbling. 352. CLOSE SHOT - BABE She can scarcely conceal her elation. 353. MED. SHOT - FRONT OF COURTROOM JUDGE Mr. Deeds, you haven't yet touched upon  a most important thing. This rather  fantastic idea of yours to want to give  away your entire fortune. It is, to  say the least, most uncommon. LONGFELLOW Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your  Honor. CAMERA MOVES TO CLOSER SHOT, featuring  Longfellow and Judge, as former continues: LONGFELLOW Suppose you were living in a small town  and getting along fine, and suddenly  somebody dropped $20,000,000 in your  lap. Supposing you discovered that all  that money was messing up your life,  was bringing a lot of vultures around  your neck, and making you lose faith  in everybody. You'd be a little worried,  wouldn't you? You'd feel that you had  a hot potato in your hand, and you'd  want to drop it. I guess Dr. Von Holler  would say you were riding on (points to chart) those bottom waves, 'cause you wanted  to drop something that was burning your  fingers. 354. MEDIUM SHOT Cedar springs to his feet. CEDAR (shouting) If this man is permitted to carry out  his plan, repercussions will be felt  that will rock the foundations of our  entire governmental system! ? 461 ? The Judge has pounded him into silence. JUDGE Please, Mr. Cedar! (to Longfellow) Proceed. 355. MED. CLOSE SHOT AT WITNESS STAND LONGFELLOW Personally, I don't know what Mr. Cedar's  raving about. From what I can see, no  matter what system of government we  have, there will always be leaders and  always be followers. 356. MED. CLOSE SHOT Farmers in audience, as Longfellow's  voice continues: LONGFELLOW'S VOICE It's like the road out in front of my  house. It's on a steep hill. Every day  I watch the cars climbing up. Some go  lickety-split up that hill on high 357. FULL SHOT LONGFELLOW some have to shift into second - and  some sputter and shake and slip back  to the bottom again. Same cars - same  gasoline - yet some make it and some  don't. And I say the fellows who can  make the hill on high should stop once  in a while and help those who can't. 358. MEDIUM SHOT LONGFELLOW (making his point) That's all I'm trying to do with this  money. Help the fellows who can't make  the hill on high. 359. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW LONGFELLOW (hotly) What does Mr. Cedar expect me to do  with it? Give it to him - and a lot  of other people who don't need it? (rising; sarcastically) If you don't mind, Your Honor, I'll  ride on those top waves for a minute. (calls out) Hey, all you fellows out there! All  those who applied for a farm, stand  up! 360. REVERSE ANGLE Showing most of the audience struggling  to their feet. ? 462 ? 361. MED. CLOSE SHOT - WITNESS CHAIR LONGFELLOW See all those fellows? They're the ones  I'm trying to help. They need it! (pointing) Mr. Cedar and that Mr. Semple don't  need anything. They've got plenty! It's  like I'm out in a big boat and I see  one fellow in a rowboat who's tired  of rowing and wants a free ride - and  another fellow who's drowning. Who would  you expect me to rescue? Mr. Cedar,  who just got tired of rowing and wants  a free ride? Or those men out there  who are drowning? Any ten-year-old child  will give you the answer to that. (to farmers etc. in courtroom) All right, fellows. Thank you. Sit down. 362. MEDIUM SHOT - FRONT OF COURTROOM LONGFELLOW Now, my plan is very simple. I was going  to give each family ten acres - a horse,  a cow and some seed. And if they work  the farm for three years, it's theirs.  Now, if that's crazy, maybe I ought  to be sent to an institution. But I  don't think it is. And what's more,  Mr. Cedar doesn't either. (vehemently) Just before the hearing started, he  offered to call the whole thing off  if I made a settlement with him. So  you see, he wouldn't think I was crazy  if he got paid off. 363. CLOSE SHOT - CEDAR He jumps to his feet, highly incensed. CEDAR It's a lie! JUDGE Mr. Cedar! CEDAR Mr. Deeds is drawing on his warped imagination! 364. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW As he listens to Cedar, watching him  antagonistically. CEDAR'S VOICE I've never heard anything so colossally  stupid in my life! Longfellow's eyes narrow resentfully. 365. WIDER ANGLE To include Longfellow, Cedar and Judge. CEDAR It's an insult to our intelligence to  sit here and listen to his childish  ravings. ? 463 ? Throughout his speech the Judge has  been pounding his gavel. Longfellow  has his eyes levelled off on Cedar. JUDGE (when quiet reigns) You will please permit Mr. Deeds to  finish. CEDAR But Your Honor JUDGE Mr. Cedar! Cedar, grumblingly, remains standing.  Judge asks Longfellow: JUDGE Anything else, Mr. Deeds? LONGFELLOW (eyes still on Cedar) No. (changes his mind; turns to Judge) Yes. There's just one more thing I'd  like to get off my chest before I finish. JUDGE Proceed. LONGFELLOW Thank you, Your Honor. He rises to his feet, takes one step  forward, and clouts Cedar flush on the  jaw. As Cedar falls into the arms of  an associate, pandemonium breaks loose. BAILIFF'S VOICE Order! Order! Order in the court! 366. FULL SHOT OF COURTROOM The Judge pounds his gavel. There are  cries of approval from the spectators.  In the midst of the commotion DISSOLVE TO: INT. COURTROOM 367. MED. PANNING SHOT Showing spectators, waiting breathlessly  for a decision. All eyes are on the  Judge. 368. CLOSE SHOT AT BENCH The Judge holds a whispered conversation  with his experts. 369. CLOSE SHOT - BABE She is apprehensive. 370. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW He glances furtively at Babe, off scene. 371. MED. SHOT OF FARMERS Leaning forward. Their entire future  hangs in the balance. 372. MED. CLOSE SHOT AT BENCH The Judge comes out of the huddle; his  face is very stern. ? 464 ? BAILIFF'S VOICE Remain seated and come to order. The  Court is again in session. JUDGE Before the Court announces its decision,  I want to warn all who are here that  the police have orders to arrest anyone  creating a disturbance. 373. QUICK FLASHES Of Babe - Cobb - Longfellow - Mac -  the farmers. 374. INSERT: CLOSE SHOT - JUDGE The Judge's preface augurs ill. 375. CLOSEUP - CEDAR His mouth curls up in a contented grimace. 376. FULL SHOT - COURTROOM All eyes are upon the Judge, who clears  his throat. JUDGE (serious mien) Mr. Deeds, there has been a great deal  of damaging testimony against you. Your  behavior, to say the least, has been  most strange. An audible gasp is heard from audience.  Judge goes on: JUDGE But in the opinion of the Court, you  are not only sane, but you are the sanest  man that ever walked into this courtroom.  Case dismissed! The shout that greets this is tumultuous.  The Judge smiles warmly, and clasps  Longfellow's hand. Immediately, Longfellow  is surrounded by a crowd of people who  come running down the aisles. 377. CLOSE SHOT - CEDAR AND GROUP They sit, stunned, disappointed. Mrs.  Semple turns to her husband and slaps  him. MRS. SEMPLE You nose-twitcher! Budington rises to confront Cedar. BUDINGTON Oh, I knew it! I knew it! You, you Cedar disgustedly pushes him in the  face, aside. 378. CLOSE SHOT - BABE She smiles ecstatically, too excited  to move. Suddenly she rises. 379. MEDIUM SHOT As Babe tries to get to Longfellow,  but finds herself on the fringe of a  jubilant crowd in the center of which  is Longfellow. She tries to break through,  but finds it impossible. Desperately,  she jumps on a chair and tries frantically  to get a glimpse of him. At that moment,  several farmers have lifted Longfellow  on their shoulders. 380. FULL SHOT - COURTROOM As jubilantly, Longfellow is carried  out on the shoulders of the excited  crowd. ? 465 ? 381. MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT As Babe frantically tries to reach Longfellow,  but is jostled aside. The parade envelops  her. 382. LONG SHOT FROM REAR The shouting mob is heading for the  door at end of courtroom. Everyone crowds  forward. 383. CLOSE SHOT IN REAR Babe is left helplessly out. DISSOLVE TO: 384. FULL SHOT OF COURTROOM Empty - except for the Falkner sisters,  still whispering to each other, and  Babe, sitting helpless and forlorn. 385. CLOSE SHOT - BABE Her eyes are filled. Dismally she starts  forward. We hear a rising commotion  from the outside, at this moment. 386. WIDER ANGLE Longfellow running toward camera with  the mob, shouting, back of him. He reaches  courtroom, slams the doors shut behind  him. Babe, attracted by the noise, looks  up. He runs toward her, and swoops her  up in his arms. 387. CLOSE SHOT - JANE & AMY JANE He's still pixilated. AMY He sure is. 388. CLOSE SHOT - BABE AND LONGFELLOW She kisses him over and over again.  He looks around and over his shoulder  at the mob, a little dazed. Finally,  he notices her effort, and gives her  one passionately back. All that is heard is the cheering of  the crowd outside and the Columbia music. FADE OUT. THE END"
