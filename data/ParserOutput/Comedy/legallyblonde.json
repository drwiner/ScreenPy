As they finish, we follow the C Girl out and into the room of -- A BLONDE GIRL IN A TANK TOP and shorts, working out on a Stairmaster as \"General Hospital\" plays on a tiny TV. She signs the card while continuing to exercise. We move on, the room of-- A BLONDE GIRL MAKING OUT WITH HER BOYFRIEND who stops lon enough to sign the card, as her boyfriend nibbles on her neck. She hands the card back and we head into the room o A BLONDE PARTY GIRL who pours a pink frozen margarita int glass from the blender, then passes it down to ANOTHER BL GIRL, assembly-line style. The card goes one way, being signed, as the drinks go the other. Once the card arrives back in the Card Girl's hands, we follow her out of the room and down the hall until she reaches the very last and biggest door -- She puts a kiss mark on the card, then kneels down and sl the card under the door."
