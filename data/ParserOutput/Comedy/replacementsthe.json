He grips the seams like he's done this before. Then he holds the football out in front of him. Suddenly, he starts barking garbled signals to an imaginary offense. He turns to his running back as he yells something like \"Blue 31!\" It comes out in bubbles He cocks his left leg and his wide receiver goes in motion. Then on the \"snap\" he turns and starts a five step drop. He moves in slow motion because hey... he's underwater! He executes a perfect play action fake on the third step of his drop, and looks \"down field\" for his receivers. But there's a blitz! He steps up in the pocket but a linebacker's arm almost takes his head off. He dodges, he bobs, he weaves in a kind of delicate ballet. He rolls left and keeps looking for the open man. Suddenly he points down field, pulls up and cocks his arm. The \"ball\" comes behind his ear and snaps forward in a perfect release. The trophy spins OUT OF FRAME but we HOLD ON Shane as he watches his pass. Suddenly, he throws both arms up in a touchdown signal. We STAY ON him as he freezes in this pose of victory, fifteen feet underwater, on the trash-covered, muddy bottom of Marina Del Rey."

Yes, you heard right: every Cowboy has now crossed the picket line, some as late as this afternoon, and they will all play tonight. Can a rag tag group of hasbeens and castoffs stand up to what was once called America's team? And what about the strike itself?

You have proven to a skeptical America that sports is not about contracts, or agents or shoe deals. Sports is about rising to the occasion. We have one more opportunity tonight to do that, one more chance to show what heart is all about. The Dallas Cowboys are waiting out there to kill you. I expect nothing less than for you to win even in your death throes. We have a powerful weapon on our side tonight: there is no tomorrow for most of you. And that makes you very dangerous people.
