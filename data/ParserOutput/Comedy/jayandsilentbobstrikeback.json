Sudd within the mist, laser beams become apparent. Sissy hands the decibel monitor to Chrissy and takes a fe steps back, shaking her hands to limber up. She then runs forward and does an impressive series of flips down the  hallway, not touching a single laser beam. Chrissy checks the decibel monitor, which rises only slig Once Sissy's flipping comes to a stop at the other end of the hallway near the Diamond case, she makes a hand gestu to Justice. Justice nods, and proceeds to do the same ser of flips down the hallway, not tripping the alarm. Chrissy checks the decibel monitor, which rises only slig Justice lands beside Sissy, and then Sissy gestures to  Chrissy. Chrissy tosses the decibel monitor over the laser beams,  Sissy catches it, and the monitor rises only slightly. Then, Chrissy proceeds with her series of flips, which ar even more impressive than the other two, including runnin up walls and pushing into handstand flips.  When she pass the last laser beam, she lands between Sissy and Justice, arms in the air like a gymnast. Then, she lets out a loud manly FART.
