She couldn't talk to another man without  him thinking she wanted to go to bed with  him.  He never hit me. But the things he  did to her...and she would always just  take it.  She never fought back.  He'd  get drunk and...she'd tell people she  just fell down or something.  Then one  night...I was thirteen.  Something  happened.  My mom suddenly wouldn't take  it anymore.  Something made her say  enough is enough.  She hit back.  Tat  only made it worse.  I watched as he hit  her over and over.  Then he knocked her  down the stairs.  She broke her neck.   And when y father saw what he'd done - he  finally became human.  He cried over her  body for a while, then went into the  garage and blew his brains out with a  shotgun.  To this day I don't remember  what that final straw was.  The shrinks  say I've blocked it out of my memory.   There's no one else alive who knows what  really happened.  I have dreams about it  sometimes, but there's always that blank  spot.  A missing piece. She stops and closes her eyes.  Jacob closes his eyes for second also - feeling her pain."

More hands appear out of the mattress lunging for any part of Gina's body as she SHRIEKS from t touch.  And Gina jumps out of bed. She leaps to the other side of the room, bumping against dresser drawers.  Turns to her bed. SWOOP.  The multiple hands disappear down into the mattre There is a quiet beat as she catches her shivering breath Then a half-dozen ARMS AND HANDS pop out from the drawers next to her.  Latching indiscriminately.  Some grabbing h legs and arms.  Some grabbing more intimate parts. Gina SCREAMS.  Pulls away from the dresser.  Yanks a few  drawers out as the hands vanish and she spins over to ano wall. Where the wall ERUPTS with outreaching arms all around he Two grab her hair.  Three on each arm.  Her legs are pinn Gina shrieks and yells and flays her arms.  Beating the h with her fists as two grabs her breasts viciously.  She  starts kicking as one particularly perverse hand BURNT AN SCARRED, pops out between her legs.  Aiming right for her crotch and in an incredible show of strength, the girl pu away from the horde. Gina heads for the door.  CRASH.  Hands blast up from the wood floor.  She leaps around them.  CRASH.  More hands t to block her way. Gina jumps around like she's in a mine field made of hot  coals.  She finally reaches to door and flings it open."
