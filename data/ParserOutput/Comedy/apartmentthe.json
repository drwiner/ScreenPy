Bud leafs thro it till he comes to the piece de resistance of the magazi He unfolds the overleaf, glances at it casually, refolds then turns to the back of the magazine and starts to read What he is so avidly interested in is the men's fashion section.  There is a layout titled WHAT THE YOUNG EXECUTI WILL WEAR with a sub-head reading The Bowler is Back. Illustrating the article are several photographs of male models wearing various styles of bowlers. Bud is definitely in the market for a bowler, but somehow his mind starts wandering.  He turns back to the overleaf again, unfolds it, studies it, then holds the magazine up vertically to get a different perspective on the subject. By now the sleeping pill is beginning to take effect, and yawns.  He drops the magazine on the floor, kills the lig settles down to sleep.  The room is dark except for the g from the dial of the electric blanket. Three seconds.  Then the phone jangles shrilly in the liv room.
