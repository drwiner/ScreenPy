Somewhere in the distance a CAR ALARM CHIRPS. - Plays with a paddle ball. The ball keeps smacking him in the face. He doesn't like it. - Wall-E discovers a DIAMOND RING in a JEWEL CASE. Throws out the ring. Keeps the case. The jewel case drops into the cooler, then... ...A RUBBER DUCKY... ...A BOBBLE HEAD DOLL... ...An OLD BOOT... ...A TROPHY... - Wall-E finds a FIRE EXTINGUISHER. Activates it. FOAM blasts in his face. It's tossed far, far away from his cooler. - Wall-E's shovel hand strikes something solid. Faces a REFRIGERATOR much larger than himself. Now what? - CU on fridge door. A WELDING BEAM moves down its center. It emits from between Wall-E's SPLIT BINOCULAR EYES."
