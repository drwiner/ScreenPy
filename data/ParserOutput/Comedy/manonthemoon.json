Andy looks up... and there's a LONG LINE OF SICKLY PEOPLE Primarily Japanese, emaciated, all stripped to their underwear and barely able to stand. They have a look of desperation and reverence. At the head of the line is JUN ROXAS at his work station: bench, a sink, and ATTENDANTS with clean towels. A SICKLY WOMAN crawls onto the bench.  Jun impassively presses his hand into the fatty flesh of her stomach, kneading, searching.  Pause, then he removes some BLOODY GUTS. He flings them into a bucket. The woman cries out. Andy gasps. The woman is helped away. Jun turns to wash his hands.  An attendant gives him a to to dry with.  Then a SICKLY MAN crawls up... Andy rolls closer.  He stares at all this with fear. Nervousness.  Hope. Jun impassively presses his hand against the man's head. concentrates, searching... then pulls out some BLOODY GUT He flings them into a bucket. The man shakes.  He is helped away. Andy is wide-eyed.  He gets closer... closer... More patients.  More bloody guts.  More sobbing. Andy's excitement builds. Then -- he reaches the front. A moment. Lynne and Zmuda stare into Andy's eyes, drawn in by his total belief.  They are overcome.  It feels like they're saying goodbye.  Lynne gives Andy a tender kiss.  Zmuda starts to shake his hand -- and instead hugs him tightly. Andy smiles, then the attendants lift him from the wheelchair.  They help him up to the bench. Andy lies down.  Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. He looks over, and Jun Roxas is washing his hands from th previous patient. Andy shivers, anticipating the miracle. Jun turns.  An attendant gives him a towel to dry off. Andy relaxes, readying for it all... He glances at Jun's hands.  Jun hands back the towel -- a under it the attendant quickly slips Jun a sack of animal intestines. Jun discreetly palms it.  He's a fake."
