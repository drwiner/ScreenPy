ANGLE ON the Thin Man. He pulls his harness tighter. REVS his engine higher. ANGLE ON Natalie. If it's a game of chicken he wants, she'll give it to him. She REVS her engine higher still. The noise scares the bird, who suddenly flies off. Like a flag being dropped, that's the signal for both racers to peel out. A cloud of SMOKE.    Rubber on asphalt. Already reaching a tremendous speed, the racers are on a collision course. The Thin Man isn't going to turn away. Neither is Natalie. Racing faster, and faster still, there's only one way this can turn out. But then, at the very last moment, the Thin Man wusses out. He cuts the wheel right, missing Natalie and careening off the edge of the pier. In SLOW MOTION, we watch as his racer hangs in mid-air, wheels still spinning. Back-heavy, the tail hits the water first. Natalie brakes hard, cuts the wheel to avoid going off the far end of the pier. She finally stops, the rear tire just 1/4 inch from the edge. CRANING UP along the side of the pier, we find Natalie looking into the water where the blue racer went in. There's just a slick of oil and a steady stream of bubble"
