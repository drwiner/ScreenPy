Both of his hands fly up to massage top of his head. THOOMP - Hi's fist flies into frame to connect with Gale' unguarded stomach. Gale doubles over, clutching at his gu Hi interlaces his fingers to make a club of his two hands With Gale's bowed head a target in front of him, Hi swing his hands up over his head. Hi's knuckles scrape painfully against the plaster of the too - low ceiling. Skin is flayed, plaster crumbles. Hi grabs at his knuckles in pain. Gale lunges with a mid- body tackle that sends Hi crashing into the wall. Gale, still on top of him, reaches back to throw a punch. The reach-back sends his elbow crashing through a window doesn't stop the punch. It connects with Hi's jaw. Gale throws another quick punch, all his weight behind it Hi's head bobs sideways just in time and Gale's fist goes through the wall. It is momentarily stuck there. Hi uses the opportunity to grab Gale's one free arm with  both of his. He is twisting it to make Gale, roaring with pain, twist around and present his back to him. Hi climbs aboard, grabbing Gale's face. Gale, still roaring, is pulling his fist out of the hole. grabs a lath exposed by the hole and pulls; it tears out the wall and snaps free, giving him a length of about two feet. Gale is rampaging around like a grizzly bear hemmed in a small space. Hi is hanging on for dear life, his own feet flailing this way and that, knocking over lamps and wall  fixtures as Gale bends and twirls about, trying to shake loose. Gale crashes and bounces off the walls, roaring in pain and fury. Close shots of Gale's face show his features impossibly a grotesquely contorted by Hi's hand, squeezing, gripping a clutching at it. Evelle is dancing around with the baby, dodging crashing  furniture and flailing body parts."
