Holden is smiling, being seduced, Banky rolls his eyes.  Beside Holden, stands a pretty  GIRL with a short haircut, who's also riveted by Alyssa's performance. Alyssa makes big-time eye contact with somebody out  there.   The song seems to be aimed at whoever she's looking at.   It's more than obvious there's a seduction going on, bur  of whom!  At the end of the song, the crowd goes wild but Alyssa's preoccupied.  She points to someone in the  crowd, and curls her finger back in a 'c'mere' fashion,  urging whoever it is to join her.  She jumps off the  stage. Holden shakes his head sheepishly and looks downward, aw- shucks style.  At that moment, the Girl beside him leaps  forward.  Banky's eyes widen.  Holden looks up and is  suddenly taken aback. Alyssa and the Girl race into each other's arms and fall  into a way-to-passionate-to-mean-anything-else kiss. Holden's eyes bug.  Banky allows a smile to creep across  his face.  The crowd applauds.  Banky looks around, and  for the first time, we get the distinct impression that  this is a lesbian bar... There are a lot of chicks in this place.  Gay chicks.   Banky looks at Holden and slaps him on the back."

The Waitress walks past and drops her pad.  She bends over, to pick it up, hiking her mini-skirt up in  the process.  Alyssa stares at her ass.  Holden stops  talking and stares at her.  Alyssa looks over at him and  offers a caught smile. 2) Holden pushes a shopping cart at the FOOD STORE,  throwing various things into the basket.  Alyssa comes up with a box of Tampons and throws them in.  Holden glances at them, a bit flushed.  Alyssa catches him, picks up the box, and pulls one out.  She proceeds to demonstrate  their usage, throwing one leg on the can and miming  insertion.  Holden puts up his hands in the \"I know, I  know,\" fashion. 3) In the Studio, Holden displays some of his artwork to  Alyssa, during which she pulls out a cigarette and goes  to light it.  It's a child-proof lighter, so she's having trouble.  Holden grows a little frustrated.  Finally, he  grabs the lighter and pulls the child proof tab out with  his teeth.  Alyssa stares at him a bit taken aback.   Holden spits the tab out, and lights Alyssa's smoke.  He  then continues with his display. 4) Holden and Alyssa at the COMIC BOOK STORE.  Steve-Dave and the Fan-Boy eye them suspiciously.  Alyssa pays for a comic.  Steve-Dave glowers at Holden.  He gives Alyssa  her change and they exit.  Steve-Dave goes back to his  card game with the Fan-Boy.  Suddenly, a garbage can  comes crashing through their window.  Steve-Dave rips a  check off the garbage can and punches the counter.  The  Fan-Boy rubs his back soothingly, 5) Holden and Alyssa walk through a PARKING LOT, talking. She takes his hand and pulls his arm around her shoulder. Holden smiles to himself."

And  it's not because you're unattainable.   I love you.  Very simple, very truly.   You're the epitome of every attribute  and quality I've ever looked for in  another person.  I know you think of  me as just a friend and crossing that  line is the furthest thing from an  option you'd ever consider.  But I  can't do this any longer.  I can't  stand next to you without wanting to  hold you.  I can't look into your eyes  without feeling that longing you only  read about in trashy romance novels.   I can't talk to you without wanting to  express my love for everything you  are.  I know this will probably queer  our friendship - no pun intended - but  I had to say it, because I've never  felt this before, and I like who I am  because of it.  And if bringing it to  light means we can't hang out anymore,  then that hurts me.  But I couldn't  allow another         day to go by without  getting it out there, regardless of  the outcome, which by the look on your  face is to be the inevitable shoot- down.  And I'll accept that But I know  some part of you is hesitating for a  moment, and if there is a moment of  hesitation, that means you feel  something too.  All I ask is that you  not suppress that - at least for ten  minutes - and try to dwell in it  before you dismiss it.   There isn't another soul on this  fucking planet who's ever made me the  person I am when I'm with you, and I  would risk this friendship for the  chance to take it to the next plateau.   Because it's there between you and me.   You can't deny that.  And even if we  never speak again after tonight,  please know that I'm forever changed  because of you and what you've meant  to me, which - while I do appreciate  it - I'd never need a painting of  birds bought at a diner to remind me  of."

Men and women  should be together, it's the natural  way - that kind of thing.  I'm not  with you because of what family,  society, life tried to instill in me  from day one.  The way the world is -  how seldom you meet that one person  who gets you... it's so rare.   My  parents didn't really have it.  There  was no example set for me in the world  of male/female relation ships.  And to  cut oneself off from finding that  person - to immediately half your  options by eliminating the possibility  of finding that one person within your  own gender... that just seemed stupid.   So I didn't.  And by leaving my  options open, I was branded 'gay',  which to me was no big deal - labels  are labels, you know?  They define  what you do, not who you are, I guess.

Alyssa gave him.   It hangs at a severely crooked angle.  He looks back to  her and shakes his head 'no'. 2) Holden and Alyssa try to play a video game.  Banky  plays as well.  Holden instructs her in the ways of NHL  '96 (turning her paddle right-side-up, pointing at things on the screen).  She presses the reset button, over and  over.  Banky gives Holden a 'What the fuck?' look.   Alyssa sticks her tongue at him. 3) At the Video Store - Holden picks up a Disney cartoon  off the shelf.  He goes to show if to Alyssa, who's  reading the back of 'Anything But Dick', an allchick  porno.  An old WOMAN stares at her.  Holden nods to the  old Woman and takes the tape out of Alyssa's hands,  putting it back on the shelf.  He ushers her away.  The  old Woman waits until they're gone and then picks up the  tape herself, 4) Holden carries Alyssa on his shoulders through the  park, her crotch against the back of his neck.  He's  talking. She taps him and he stops and looks up.  She  begins to maneuver around so her crotch is in his face.   He pulls her off and put her down.  She's laughing.  He's flushed with embarrassment.  The same Old Woman from the  Video store passes by with her husband.  Holden shrugs. 5) In Holden's Apartment again - Alyssa again with the  waving, then putting up her hands to stop.  Cut to Holden again, this time with the painting hung completely upside down.  He looks at it, then offers her a bewildered gaze. 6) In the Office Banky comes to his drawing table.  There are penciled pages on it with a note that says \"Hanging  out with Alyssa today.  Holden\".  Banky crumples it up  and throws it across the room. 7) In Holden's Apartment - Alyssa waves this way, then  that way, then puts up her hands frantically to stop.   She settles back against the wall, a satisfied smile  crawling across her face, and closes her eyes.  We pull  back to reveal Holden on his knees in front of her,  eating her out (no, we don't see anything!)."

And I start  pulling her pants down all slow, 'cuz  I figure any second she's gonna turn  around and belt me in the mouth,  right?  But yo, check this shit out -  she's all into it man!  She don't try  to stop me or nothing!  She's                  all wet and shit, and I just went to  work, know what I'm saying?  Me and  Rick are going to town on this crazy  bitch, and she's just loving it, all  moaning and shit!  It was fucked up!   So Rick's the one that came up with  the nickname - 'cuz that day, she had  us locked in tight from both sides -  like a pair of goddamn Chinese finger  cuffs!"

Or what if- I sincerely  doubt it, but what if - I saw  something in Banky that I never saw  before, and fell in love with him and  left you.  I've been down roads like  this before; many times.  I know you  feel doing this will broaden your  horizons and give you experience.  But  I've had those experiences on my own.   I can't accompany you on your's.  I'm  past that now. (touches his face; stares to  cry) Or maybe I just love you too much.   And I feel hurt and let down that  you'd want to share me with anyone.   Because I never wanted to share you (holds it in; gets up) Regardless I can't be a part of this. (beat) Or you.  Not anymore (hugs him) I love you.  I always will.  Know  that."
