We watch as she swims a 100 yard individual medley; first the butterfly, then the backstroke, breaststroke and fina freestyle. We condense the time, of course, SHOOTING some underwater, some SLO-MO, as she knives through the water, her hair flowing behind her, an athlete alone with her me The SEQUENCE should convey not only the grace of her stro and her athletic ability, but the fluid beauty of swimmin its synthesis of power and form. As she begins the freestyle leg, another body appears in pool next to her. It's Jake, and he's racing her the fina lap.
