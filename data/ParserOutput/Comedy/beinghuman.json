We will think about it. On the far side of the cave we see the sleeping children. As we MOVE CLOSER we see that they are far from sleep. Two sets of bright eyes peek out from under their cover. We CUT BETWEEN them, the loving parents and the watching, learning children. Hector is arguing with his son, just outside their cave. The Boy wants to go foraging with him again."

Every now and then he will suck a cockle from its shell or crunch on a particularly tasty piece of seaweed. Hector looks about 30 years old. This is advanced middle age for his times and it shows. He has a heavy cold and an irritating hack in his throat. In a similar condition a modern individual would spend two or three pleasantly drugged days in bed, perhaps attempting a little light paperwork propped up on some pillows. The sun is warming the day. Hector sits on a rock, sur- veying his world. He seems very much a part of it. He watches some wading seabirds nearby. Like him they are nosing around the margins of low tide for food. He smiles. In another season they or their eggs will pro- vide a meal or two. There is a strange atmosphere of appropriateness in the scene, Hector seems such an inte- gral part of it. The easy fit of the man in his land- scape strikes us. Hector belongs to it in ways that a present-day hunter or holiday maker, or even naturalist, never could. Also, there is an odd sense of the world being rather empty. Whether the larger world is round or flat,   spinning or orbiting, Hector neither knows nor cares.    He knows simple things. Cold and hunger. He knows     warmth, roug comfort and companionship. His family and    the safety o their cave. Further along the shore Hector drops his bag and straigh- tens himself, easing the ache in his back. Then some- thing disturbs him. From behind a distant headland a smudge of smoke trails into the sky. Hector picks up his bag and runs. He knows where he is going. He reaches a vantage point on some rocks. He steadies himself and gazes hard out to sea. We can feel the strain in his eyes as he tries to detect any hint of threat in the glinting water. Then his jaw drops in fear. Around the edge of the headland two dark shapes proceed in regular motion. Their steady progress is full of menace. Oar- driven boats, slowly, insistently making their way into Hector's bay. He jumps from the rocks and runs up the beach toward the cave. One thing else that Hector knows is fear, blind, gut-turning fear."

They are playfully attempting to communicate with her, and although still a little timid, she is smiling. There is no hint of bar- barity, rape or abuse. That was not the intention of the Raiders. To them, a fertile woman and two healthy children are as gold will be to plunderers of later ages. For their part, the family have to accept the situation. Food and shelter are the best that life can offer. Painfully, Hector takes in the reality of the scene. His family have been stolen from him, plain and simple. In the morning they will be gone, out to sea and round the headland forever. He watches them for a while longer, then it becomes too painful.

Hector watches these moments of departure, watches the faces of his family. Hector makes his move. In a mad act he breaks cover and runs down toward the departing boats. The last Raiders are climbing aboard. Hector charges at full speed to the water's edge. He screams agonizingly at the Raiders and impotently starts throwing stones at them. The Raiders all look at him. The LEADER is impudently brushing Hector's missiles aside, like so many flies and smiling. Suddenly Hector's rage and energy leave him. He stands looking at the Raiders and they look at him, for a long moment. The Raiders are all young men, hardly into their twenties, and nowadays might resemble something like a motorcycle gang. But in Hector's time they are men in the full prime of life. They begin to laugh and exchange remarks about Hector. He returns their looks fiercely. His woman and children sit on the boat, frozen in fear. The Leader eventually turns from Hector, still smiling and gives an order. The men lift their oars and prepare to leave. Then an older man stands up in the other boat. He calls over to the Leader, nodding in the direction of Hector. Hector doesn't know what they are saying, but they have an intense exchange, obviously centered on him. The older man seems to be an adviser, a priest or wise man, although he's still only about thirty years old. The Leader listens to him intently. The PRIEST talks and points to the cliffs. The Leader looks there and nods his head. He gives some instructions to his men. Hector stands, bemused. Six or so of the Raiders leave the boats, wade ashore and without any resistance from him, take hold of Hector. Hector's children instictively rise as if to defend their father, but Deirdre, despite her own feelings, wisely holds them back."

He will take whatever is offered to him. The man comes close, the knife held ready. He stands in front of Hector for a moment. On the boat, Hector's family are tense with fear for his life."

The man stands sheepishly for a moment, then drops the rope at Hector's feet and wades back to the boat. A piece of rope in exchange for a family. Hector watches them for some time, his family and the strange Raiders, as they, achingly slowly, retreat from his view and his life. At last he turns and moves up from the shoreline. He goes some distance then stops, thinks for a moment, then retraces his steps. He goes back to the water's edge, picks up the piece of rope that bound him, and walks off with it. It might be of some use to him."

It is the hot room of a bathhouse somewhere in the Roman Empire. We have advanced 4000 years into the future and it shows in the technology. It is men's day at the bathhouse. All of the people relaxing in the water look prosperous and comfortable with themselves. Slaves wait in attendance, some around the edge of the pool, others in the water rubbing backs and massaging shoulders. There are three or four times as many slaves as bathers, and the proprie- torial way that they look after their masters gives the place the odd atmosphere of a kindergarten for over- indulged grown-ups. And then we find our Hector. He stands against the wall, holding a large towel. Although clean-shaven and more healthy-looking we can still recognize Hector, more so by the look in his eyes. There is a set to his face that tells us he is a man alone, emotionally detached from his surroundings. He is a personal body slave. He watches his master in the pool, alert to any hint of need that he might have. Hector's master LUCINNIUS is not as relaxed as the others around him. He is in anxious conversation with an older man wading beside him. We don't hear what they are saying but there is enough body language to detect Lucinnius' pleading and the older man's cool distraction. The older man gives a final dismissive shake of his head. Hector immediately moves to the side of the pool with the towel Lucinnius climbs out of the water."

From morning until night, and probably in his dreams too, Hector is living two lives, his own and his master's. Here in ancient Rome is this what they call classic schizophrenia?

We almost expect Hector to give him a little wave of encouragement as he is finally summoned into the inner office. Hector waits. The first signs seem good. Lucinnius doesn't emerge within the first minute. Cyprian is at least giving him the time of day. More minutes pass. Hector watches a game of handball while keeping an eye on the office door. One or two others, familiar to us from the bathhouse, go into the office. So does Lucinnius' friend Julian. Eventually Lucinnius emerges into the sunlight, a broad smile on his face. Hector relaxes and leaves the ball game to join him."

His eyes begin to close. Then a SOUND in the distance makes him open them again. He listens. MORE SOUNDS drift up to him from the floor of the valley. He stands up and crosses the track. At first he can see nothing. He walks back along the rim of the road. Then he sees where the noise is coming from. A mounted skirmish is in progress, just where a wooden bridge crosses the small river, at the very bottom of the valley There are no more than 30 knights in full armor, with twice as many foot soldiers and squires. Even from such a distance Hector can see and hear that the fighting is ferocious, almost insane in its intensity. From this distance it is like a puppet show, except the violence is real. The scene places Hector in his time and for us there is a strange feeling to it, almost as if Hector has awoken from sleep and found himself transported to some distant age. But this is not the case. Hector is where he belongs, in Medieval Europe. Hector makes his decision. With a last look behind him he runs off in the direction of the wagon.

Individual soldiers, like lost souls, run here and there trying to regroup with their comrades. The youngest are squires of twelve or thir- teen, the oldest are red-faced, overweight knights in expensive armor. Hector and Beatrice have found a quiet corner where they can sit and talk. Behind them is a group of soldiers, reserves who have not yet joined the battle. They are much fresher than the rest and are drilling as a disci- plined unit. Their movements are a strange cross between parade ground drill and battle training. To the BEAT of DRUMS they perform rhythmic, hypnotic movements, repeating the same pattern over and over again. A deadly dance, thrusting their pikes in unison. They become like one evil, inhuman machine. It is mesmerizing to watch, all the more so in relation to the coy seduction scene that Hecto and Beatrice are acting out. They have the problem of not sharing a language, but, resourceful as lovers are, they soon employ this as another titillating element in their love-play."

The Priest makes his way to his corner, but on the way he pauses by Beatrice. She snores lightly. The Priest bends over and takes a long sniff at her, then he sighs out his admiration. He steps over her and settles into his own space by the window. He suddenly misses the presence of Hector. He looks again at Beatrice, still and sleeping. What the Priest doesn't see is the extra pair of hands massaging her neck and head. She moans softly in her pretence of sleep. The Priest is troubled, suspicious, but he doesn't know why. He sniffs again, in the general direction of Beatrice. The mingled smells that his sensitive nose detects perplex him, but he settles down, pulling his cloak over his head. Across the room, Hector's head emerges from the covering beside Beatrice. They make love quietly in the dark, also enjoying the thrill of confounding the Priest."

The raft is in the full rage of the surf. The sense behind its loose construction is obvious now. Snake-like it rides the waves, one half up, the other down. The beaching isn't easy. A few people are washed overboard with no way of saving them. Finally the raft makes it through the barrier of the outer surf. They are in a long curving bay. Up from the beach lies an area of dunes, and beyond that a thick belt of jungle. The raft scrapes onto the sand. Those near the beach scramble ashore, immediately prostrating themselves in prayers of thanks while those at the back jump into the water and clumsily wade the last few feet to safety. Hector's attention is never far from Ursula. She is struggling in the water with some of her baggage. A youth, NUNO, goes to help her. Hector overtakes him and nudges him out of the way, offering to take Ursula's load from her shoulders. She refuses his help. Waist-deep in water they tussle over her bundle of possessions. Hector overpowers her, wrestles her load from her grasp, angrily wades to the shore and dumps it on the sand. In amongst the drama of their situation their little battle of wills seems petty and pathetic, but it reveals much about their past."

Most of what he has earned or plundered in his colonial years now lies at the bottom of the ocean. Since he is socially superior to anyone else on the ship he assumes responsibility and command. There are probably fifty men among the survivors more suited to lead them to safety. By Dom Paulo's side always is his SON. A quiet boy of about eleven. He is like a little miniature of his father, dressed in the same style of clothes. He is a constant, silent witness to everything that Dom Paulo doe good or bad, wise or foolish. He and his father are a continuing fascination for Hector, and we can enjoy Hector watching the boy watching his father. Some of the absurdities and comedies of the situation can be high- lighted in this way. There can be sadness in it too however, the pain of a son witnessing his father's compromises or failures all too closely, and Dom Paulo's sad awareness of his image slowly tarnishing in his son's eyes. Amidst the construction work, Dom Paulo is talking with some of his OFFICERS."

This car trip will pull the threads together. And after so many images of the natural world, a world little altered by man, the PANORAMIC SHOTS of New York in all its mad glory will place our Hector in a new dimen- sion. If there is a breathtaking moment in this film, when everything comes together, when all the pieces fit, then it will be somewhere around here that it happens. Six thousand years ago we left Hector on a beach, aching for his family. If the traffic allows, tonight in New Jersey Hector will complete his journey. We will GO WITH Hector OVER the bridge, ACROSS the avenues of Manhattan and THROUGH the tunnel. His PHONE RINGS ONCE."
