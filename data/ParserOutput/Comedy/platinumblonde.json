For cryin' out loud,  where is that? Go and dig him up! Stew!  Stew Smith! CAMERA TRUCKS ON: Until it takes in a sort of make-shift  screen, concealing a corner of the room. LAP DISSOLVE TO: 3. CLOSE SHOT On the other side of the screen. Stew  Smith is holding something in his hand.  His hat tilted back on his head, and  he is regarding this plaything intently.  Gallagher is sitting close to him, also  gazing intently at the plaything. Gallagher  is a girl, one of the sob sisters[2]  on the newspaper, dressed in a trim  but inexpensive little tailored suit. STEW Here it is. Pray for me, Gallagher.  Pray for me. Hold everything . . . 4. CLOSE SHOT On the object in his hand, one of those  hand-puzzles where you have to land  jumping beans in the holes. 5. DOUBLE SHOT GALLAGHER Stew, your hands are shaking. You've  been drinking again. STEW Come on, come on. Here they come, Gallagher!  Here they come! Conroy's shouts are heard in the background. GALLAGHER (conspiratorially) The boss is getting hoarse. STEW There's the third one. If I don't get  the last one, there's a certain sob  sister I know that's going to get a  kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops,  almost had that. 6. MED. CLOSE SHOT Conroy, the City Editor at his desk,  looking about with a scowl for Stew. CONROY (bellowing) Stew! Stew Smith! The Copy Boy races over to whisper something  to Conroy. ? 5 ? CONROY What? The screen? 7. CLOSE SHOT On Stew Smith STEW Gallagher! I made it! 8. MEDIUM SHOT (FROM CONROY'S ANGLE) The screen, concealing the washbasin  corner. CONTINUATION, SCENE 6 A wrathy Conroy, his eyes centering  suspiciously on something. With his  eyes on the screen, Conroy reaches out  and grasps a heavy telephone book on  the corner of his desk. Still looking  off, he heaves it forcefully. 9. MED. CLOSE SHOT Showing the screen. The telephone book  crashes into it, overturning it and  revealing Stew and Gallagher on the  other side. They both look up, startled.  The newsroom erupts in laughter. CONTINUATION, SCENE 6 Conroy, glaring off fiercely. CONROY Come over here! 10. MEDIUM SHOT Conroy at his desk. Stew saunters into  the scene. STEW Look, I quit! CONROY Yeah? STEW Yeah. CONROY Yeah? STEW You're always picking on me. It took  me three hours to get those little gadgets  in those holes, and you screw it up  in a minute. Hey, look! He gives the hand-puzzle to Conroy,  who is immediately captivated by the  fascinating object in his hand. 11. CLOSE DOUBLE SHOT STEW (superior) Mmm, not as easy as it looks, is it? Conroy puts it down with a disgusted  look. CONROY Aagh! No wonder you're batty. Would  it be imposing too much upon you if  I asked you to do a little work today?  Just to sort of break the monotony? ? 6 ? STEW With me you can always do business. CONROY Do you know what to do in a drawing-room? STEW It isn't a question of knowing what  to do, it's knowing how to get in one  that counts. The telephone rings, Conroy answers  it. CONROY (speaking on the phone) Yeah, yeah. Okay, okay. He hangs up, turns back to Stew. Now listen, we've got a tip that the  Schuyler family has finally made a deal  with that chorus dame. STEW Gloria Golden? CONROY Yeah, little Gloria. STEW The human cash register. Got her hooks  into the Schuyler kid, eh? CONROY Right - for the first time this year. STEW (modestly) Well - it's only April. CONROY Come on, get going, get going! STEW (loftily) Get going where? I can write that yarn  without stepping out of the office. CONROY Yeah - and get us into a million dollar  libel suit. It wouldn't be the first  time. Now, you get over there and get  a statement out of the old lady, the  sister, or the kid. Any of them - but  get it. STEW (resigned) All right. Give me a voucher for expenses. 12. CLOSE DOUBLE SHOT (ANOTHER ANGLE) CONROY What expenses? All you need is carfare  to Long Island. You'd better get a shave  and a shine, because you, you're going  to have a tough time getting in there  as it is. ? 7 ? STEW I know those bluenoses. Their ancestors  refused to come over on the Mayflower  because they didn't want to rub elbows  with the tourists. So they swam over. He turns away and exits. FADE OUT: FADE IN 13. EXT. THE SCHUYLER HOUSE - DAY -  MEDIUM SHOT Someone pacing outside the mansion gates. 14. EXT. THE SCHUYLER HOUSE (ANOTHER  ANGLE) - DAY - CLOSE SHOT A guard dog pacing inside the gates. 15. INT. INSIDE THE MANSION - DAY -  CLOSE SHOT A parrot on its perch, hopping from  foot to foot. 16. INT. SCHUYLER DRAWING ROOM - DAY  - CLOSE SHOT Michael Schuyler, a callow youth with  the usual dissipated, spoiled look.  His fingers are nipping out little chunks  of a folded piece of paper, dropping  the bits on the floor. This is indicative  of a habit of the individual in question  when undergoing nervous stress. He is  very fidgety and apprehensive, as he  glances around. CAMERA PANS OVER TO SHOW Anne Schuyler, a beautiful and aristocratic,  though slightly hard girl, a few years  older than Michael. CAMERA PANS OVER TO SHOW Mrs. Stuyvesand Van Alstyne Schuyler,  mother of Anne and Michael. A grande  dame, stern and glowering. Her attitude  indicates suppressed nervousness and  anger. She glares over in the direction  of Michael. Then she turns and looks  in another direction. MRS. SCHUYLER (viciously) Dexter Grayson, if you were any kind  of a lawyer, you'd get those letters  back! CAMERA PANS OVER TO SHOW Dexter Grayson, the family lawyer standing,  his hands clasped behind his back, just  completing the pacing of a few short  steps in his best courtroom manner,  his head bowed in an attitude of deepest  thought. He is dressed in striped afternoon  trousers and black coat. He turns to  regard Mrs. Schuyler. GRAYSON But I keep telling you how difficult  it is, Mrs. Schuyler. The last time  I asked her for those letters, she made  very uncouth noises with her mouth. CAMERA PANS OVER TO SHOW Anne Schuyler, trying desperately to  keep from laughing. CAMERA DRAWS BACK To reveal a full shot of the room and  group. They are in the magnificent drawing  room of the Schuyler home, resembling  the Union Depot and furnished with almost  imperial splendor and magnificence.  They very much resemble a jury in session.  As they continue: ? 8 ? MICHAEL I don't know why you're making all this  fuss. I only sent her six of them. MRS. SCHUYLER (sarcastic) If you had to make a fool of yourself,  why didn't you tell it to her instead  of writing? MICHAEL Because I couldn't get her on the phone. MRS. SCHUYLER Imbecile! ANNE You should have known better than to  write, Romeo. I found that out a long  time ago. MRS. SCHUYLER I should say you had. At the rate you  two are going, we'll have to leave the  country to save our faces. ANNE Splendid, Mother. Let's hop over to  Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save  a face. MRS. SCHUYLER Oh, shut up! A butler appears in the doorway. He  is about to say something, but he stammers  and turns. MRS. SCHUYLER (stopping him) What is it, Smythe? SMYTHE Pardon me, madam - but what am I to  say to the newspapermen? Mrs. Schuyler looks distractedly at  Grayson. 17. CLOSER SHOT Mrs. Schuyler and Grayson. She rises  and speaks imperiously: MRS. SCHUYLER Dexter, go out and tell those ruffians  I have nothing to say. Grayson faces her placatingly. GRAYSON You can't do that. Leave it to me. I  know how to handle reporters. MRS. SCHUYLER (with a shudder) All right, then - get it over with. ? 9 ? 18. MEDIUM FULL SHOT Grayson turns officiously toward the  waiting butler. GRAYSON We've decided to see the reporters.  Send in the man from the Tribune first. SMYTHE Very good, sir. MRS. SCHUYLER Oh, Smythe, some bicarbonate of soda,  quick - double strength. I know those  news mongrels[3] will upset me. SMYTHE I've anticipated it, madame. The bicarbonate  is ready. The butler exits. 19. INT. SCHUYLER LIBRARY - DAY - FULL  SHOT This room resembles the Grand Central  Station. It is lined with bookcases  filled with gorgeous first editions  and special bindings, and is furnished  in the extreme of magnificence and luxury. Present are Stew and Bingy, reporter  from the Tribune. Stew is seated, idly  leafing through a first edition. Bingy, still with his hat on, spots  an expensive music box on a nearby table,  opens it and does a little jig to the  tune that is emitted. 20. CLOSER SHOT Bingy, as he lingers at the table. He  is a lazy, sloppy-looking guy. His face  needs a shave and his pants need pressing.  There is a spot of dried ketchup on  his tie. On the table is a humidor.  Bingy opens it and lifts out a handful  of cigars. 21. CLOSE SHOT - STEW As he looks up from the book, he suggests: STEW Hey Bingy, you'll find the silverware  in the dining room. CONTINUATION, SCENE 20 Bingy turns, putting the cigars in his  pocket. BINGY Much obliged. 22. MEDIUM FULL SHOT Smythe enters. SMYTHE (frigidly) Mr. Grayson has decided to see you. ? 10 ? Both Stew and Bingy start forward eagerly.  Smythe continues: SMYTHE The gentleman from the Tribune, first. 23. CLOSER THREE SHOT Bingy beams broadly and Stew is disappointed. STEW There are no gentlemen on the Tribune. SMYTHE I understand, sir. Smythe leads the way out. As Bingy passes  by, Stew trips him. BINGY Say, take it easy! Take it easy! Listen,  my boy. No use you hanging around here.  Just buy the Tribune tonight and read  all about it. You can rewrite it for  your last edition. STEW Couldn't make the last edition. It'd  take me four hours to translate your  story into English. BINGY Oh, is that so? STEW I'm afraid. Bingy turns to leave. Take off your hat. You might make an  impression. Bingy dutifully doffs his hat. Impossible. Put it on again. BINGY Hey, make up your mind, will you? Bingy hurriedly puts his hat back on  as he disappears. 24. INT. SCHUYLER DRAWING ROOM - DAY  - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT By the door which leads out into the  hall. The butler enters and stops, standing  stiffly. Bingy enters behind him, shambling  awkwardly. He stops in some consternation  as he sees: 25. MEDIUM SHOT (FROM HIS ANGLE) The Schuyler jury. Grayson, Mrs. Schuyler,  Anne and Michael, all surveying him  in varying degrees of unfriendliness. CONTINUATION, SCENE 24 Bingy hesitates uneasily as he regards  this impressive assemblage. Quickly,  he takes his hat back off. Then he smiles  nervously and starts forward. BINGY Hi, folks! ? 11 ? CONTINUATION, SCENE 25 Grayson comes forward to meet him, attempting  to be very cordial. Bingy is seized  by a sudden impulse to sneeze. He does  so, violently. There is awkward silence.  Mrs. Schuyler throws off a visible shudder. BINGY What's the matter? Isn't there a 'bless  you' in the crowd? GRAYSON You're the Tribune man? BINGY Yeah, hello. How are you? Bingy extends his hand. Grayson pointedly  ignores it. GRAYSON (cordially) Fine. Have a seat. BINGY Thanks, I will. Bingy crosses the room, taking note  of the beauteous Anne. GRAYSON This way. BINGY Oh, man! Bingy sits gingerly on the edge of a  handsome chair. BINGY Oh, boy! 26. MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT Bingy and Grayson. Grayson picks up  a very flossy and expensive cigarette  box from the small end table beside  the chair. It is made of gold and semi-precious  stones are inset in the cover. Grayson  opens the lid and takes out a cigarette,  but pointedly does not offer one to  Bingy. Grayson remains standing before the  reporter, who is very uncomfortable  and ill at ease. GRAYSON Fine newspaper the Tribune. BINGY Well, I should say! GRAYSON I knew your managing editor very well. BINGY Is that so? GRAYSON Yale '21, I believe. ? 12 ? BINGY (uncomprehending) Huh? GRAYSON We were classmates. 27. CLOSE SHOT - MRS. SCHUYLER She clears her throat menacingly, as  she looks sternly at Grayson. MRS. SCHUYLER Ahem! BINGY What's the matter? She got a cold? CONTINUATION, SCENE 26 Bingy and Grayson. Both look over. Grayson  gives her a quick reassuring glance,  as though to say \"leave it to me now.\"  He continues his conversation with the  reporter. GRAYSON I got him his job on the paper. I'm  a stock-holder, you know. BINGY Is that so? GRAYSON As one Tribune man to another He laughs. BINGY (laughs) Yeah! GRAYSON But right now I'm acting in the capacity  of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney. BINGY Oh, that's all right with me. I won't  hold it against you. But you see, I'm  here to find out about GRAYSON I know, I know. But there's no truth  in the story whatsoever. BINGY Oh yeah? 28. MEDIUM SHOT Grayson and Bingy. He takes Bingy by  the arm and leads him over to a corner  of the room, assuming a confidential  pose. GRAYSON (speaking as they walk) However, I've taken the trouble to prepare  a little statement. Here it is. Here. ? 13 ? 29. CLOSER TWO SHOT Grayson and Bingy. Grayson takes an  envelope out of his pocket and hands  it to Bingy. Bingy opens the flap and  sees the contents. INSERT: ENVELOPE The corner of a fifty dollar bill protrudes. BACK TO SCENE: Bingy quickly shuts the envelope up.  Grayson is watching him closely. GRAYSON So, you see how silly that rumor is? BINGY Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey. GRAYSON That's what I wanted to say, but I couldn't  think of it. Grayson starts leading him toward the  door. CAMERA PANS WITH THEM as Grayson  leads him toward the door, talking as  they walk. GRAYSON Thank you very much. BINGY All right, all right, don't mention  it. GRAYSON Give my regards to your managing editor. BINGY I certainly will. They stop at the door. Bingy extends  a handshake, which is again refused.  He stops and looks back at the jury. 30. MEDIUM SHOT FROM HIS ANGLE The Schuylers all sitting silently and  contemplating him. BINGY Well, so long folks! He flutters his eyes at Anne. BINGY Thanks! He takes one last look at Mrs. Schuyler  and is again gripped by a violent sneeze. MRS. SCHUYLER (rising to the occasion) Uh, bless you! ALL Bless you! BINGY Thanks. The butler appears in the doorway behind  him. Bingy exits past him, beaming. ? 14 ? BINGY (waving to butler) So long! Grayson nods to the butler. GRAYSON Smythe, bring in the other reporter. SMYTHE Yes, sir. 31. INT. SCHUYLER DRAWING ROOM - MEDIUM  FULL SHOT The group awaiting the advent of the  Post reporter. Stew is shown in by the  butler, still carrying the Conrad book  in his hand. They give him the once-over.  Mrs. Schuyler raises her lorgnette with  a magnificent gesture. Stew eyes them  with animation, not in the slightest  discouraged by this supercilious scrutiny.  He starts toward them. 32. MEDIUM SHOT As Stew approaches them. STEW Schuyler's the name, I presume? Yes,  thank you, thank you. My name's Smith  - Stewart Smith. No relation to John,  Joe, Trade or Mark. Of course you can't  have everything. He smiles engagingly on them. Stew addresses  Mrs. Schuyler ingratiatingly, disregarding  her expression of obvious distaste. STEW Nice set of Conrads you have out there,  Mrs. Schuyler. I was just glancing through  this one. (indicates the book in his hand) What's Michael tearing the paper about? GRAYSON Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit  put out by all the rumors going around. 33. CLOSER SHOT - STEW AND GRAYSON STEW Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise  case a rumor? GRAYSON No breach-of-promise case has been filed.  The matter has been settled out of court. STEW (very cagey) Oh I see, but Gloria doesn't seem to  be satisfied with the twenty thousand  dollars. 34. A MEDIUM SHOT OF GROUP At this, Mrs. Schuyler rises wrathfully. MRS. SCHUYLER (furiously to Grayson) Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only  ten thousandand you didn't even get  those letters from that Jezebel! ? 15 ? STEW Oh, so you did give her ten thousand  dollars, eh? and there are letters .  . . Behind Stew's back, Grayson makes violent  gestures for her to shut up. STEW Well, well. That takes it out of the  rumor class, doesn't it? GRAYSON We admit nothing. However, I have a  little statement all prepared. He takes Stew's arm and walks him off  toward a corner much in the same manner  as he handled Bingy, and lowers his  voice confidentially. 35. CLOSER SHOT - STEW AND GRAYSON Apart from the others. STEW A statement? Good. GRAYSON I have it here. STEW Good. Grayson takes an envelope out of his  pocket and hands it to Stew. Stew puts  the book under his arm, takes the envelope  and extracts the contents. It is another  greenback. STEW (with interest) Fifty bucks, eh? He regards it a moment, then replaces  the bill in the envelope. His voice  is matter-of-fact, and almost casual. STEW Don't you know you should never offer  a newspaper man more than two dollars?  If you do, he'll think it's counterfeit.  I don't need fifty dollars. As a matter  of fact, I've got fifty dollars. Grayson is considerably disconcerted.  He tries again. GRAYSON The man from the Tribune seemed perfectly  satisfied. STEW Who, Bingy? Yeah, Bingy would. He never  saw fifty dollars before. You could  have bought him for six bits. Funny  thing about Bingy. The more he gets  - the more he prints. He looks stupid,  doesn't he? But oh how smart he gets  when he bends over a typewriter. He hands the envelope back to Grayson  and turns away. ? 16 ? 36. MEDIUM SHOT Schuyler group - taking his action with  dismay. Stew starts walking back toward  them, talking as he walks, Grayson beside  him, considerably distracted. STEW So ten grand was the amount you gave  the girl? Any other statement you folks  would like to make? There is an explosive chorus from the  group. GROUP (ad-lib talking at the same time) That's not so! We have nothing more to say! We'll make no statements. He turns to them, holding up his hand  and speaking plaintively. STEW Wait a minute. Don't get excited. I  wouldn't worry about it. A little publicity  never hurt anybody. 37. CLOSE SHOT - MRS. SCHUYLER She is on the point of an apopletic  stroke. She advances menacingly toward  Stew. She calls to Grayson. MRS. SCHUYLER (shrieking at him) Dexter, have this person leave immediately. 38. MEDIUM SHOT - THE GROUP Stew is not at all perturbed. Dexter  takes him by the arm and starts to lead  him out. GRAYSON I think you'd better go. STEW Go?! Wait a minute - that's a great  story! Newspaper reporter was forcibly  ejected from Schuyler Mansion, and Anne comes up to him. ANNE Wait a minute He faces her and cannot help but register  an appreciation of her beauty. ANNE Don't mind Mother. STEW (cheerfully) I don't mind her if you don't. CONTINUATION SCENE 37 Mrs. Schuyler, almost choking in her  wrath at this outrageous stranger. ? 17 ? MRS. SCHUYLER Anne! 39. CLOSE SHOT - ANNE AND STEW Anne stifles a smile at this cheerful  insolence. ANNE I'm sure you're quite willing to be  decent about this. STEW Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to  be noble. Anne continues in her most devastating  manner. ANNE You're not going to print this silly  thing, are you? STEW (noncomittally) No? Why not? She puts her hand lightly on his arm. ANNE Because my name's Schuyler too. And  I haven't done a thing, but I'll suffer  with Michael. And so will Mother. 40. CLOSEUP - STEW He has been listening to this and enjoying  it immensely. He looks over at Mrs.  Schuyler. 41. REVERSE ANGLE ON MRS. SCHUYLER Who is making a show of holding back  a flood of tears. CONTINUATION SCENE 40 STEW Mother's suffering already! CONTINUATION SCENE 39 Anne, not wanting to lose her point,  looks up at Stew pleadingly. ANNE As a special favor to me, you won't  print that story, will you? CONTINUATION SCENE 40 Stew, looking down at her in frank approval  and admiration. ANNE (pleading) Please Stew hesitates still. 42. MEDIUM SHOT Mrs. Schuyler, Michael, and Grayson.  All watching the couple intently, hanging  on the next wordswondering if Anne  is going to succeed. They are tense  and expectant. ? 18 ? 43. CLOSE SHOT - ANNE AND STEW He is looking down into her soft, melting  eyes. Then he smiles. STEW You know something, lady, if you sold  life insurance, I'd go for a policy  in sixty seconds. ANNE Oh, thank you, I knew you'd understand. CONTINUATION SCENE 42 The three. They relax and exchange relieved  and triumphant glances. Apparently Anne  has won. 44. MEDIUM SHOT - ENTIRE GROUP Stew turns aside. STEW May I use your telephone? ANNE (eagerly) Certainly. Right over there. STEW You're all right. She indicates. Stew starts for the telephone.  Anne walks to her mother's side. Stew  gets to the telephone and picks up the  receiver. STEW Hello, Beekman 1300? (he turns to wink at the group) That's an unlucky number. You know that,  don't you? 45. CLOSE SHOT - STEW At the telephone. He turns back to the  instrument as he gets his connection. STEW (into phone) Hello, Toots? Is Conroy there? Give  me Conroy. (pause) He isn't? Try the washroom, will you? While he waits for the connection, he  turns and addresses the group expansively. STEW Say, I interviewed a swell guy the other  day - Einstein. Swell guy, a little  eccentric, but swell. Doesn't wear any  garters. Neither do I as a matter of  fact. What good are garters anyway? (he turns back to the phone) Hello, Conroy? This is Smith talking.  I'm up at the Schuylers. No, I'm not  having tea - that is, not yet. (again, he winks expansively at the  groupthen returns to Conroy) Is she beautiful? Oh boss, her pictures  don't do her justice. If I was that  guy Ziegfield - what? ? 19 ? 46. CLOSE SHOT - ANNE AND MRS. SCHUYLER Anne smiles in spite of herself at this  flattery. Stew's voice goes on. STEW'S VOICE Yes, it's easy to see where her beauty  comes from. From her mother. For the first time, Mrs. Schuyler unbends  to the extent of giving forth a smile.  She cannot help but be pleased at this  compliment. The atmosphere is now very  friendly. Everybody feels that everything  is all right. CONTINUATION SCENE 45 Stew at the phone STEW Now wait a minute. Just hold on. Keep  your shirt on. I'm coming to that. The  Schuylers admit the story is true. Right.  They gave the gal ten thousand bucks.  But she's got some letters - and she's  holding out for more dough - and it  looks to me like she's going to get  it. 47. MEDIUM SHOT - SCHUYLER GROUP Horrified and shocked at this betrayal  and double-crossing. STEW (on the phonebreezily) Right boss. I'll be right over. Right  - no, I don't think I can get any pictures  now. Right. He casually hangs up and turns from  the phone. MRS. SCHUYLER (involuntary gasp) Oh-h-h . . .! Anne confronts him as if he were a reptile  of the lowest order. ANNE (voice cold as ice) I've met some rotters in my time, but  without a doubt, you're the lowest excuse  for a man I've ever had the misfortune  to meet Stew starts walking toward the door,  still holding his book. The family is  tremendously indignant and agitated. Stew stops, turns, looks at them. He  is met by icy glares. He indignantly  takes a nickel out of his pocket and  hands it to Grayson. STEW (with dignity) Well, if you feel that way about it,  here's a nickel for the phone call. He glares at themturns and walks out. They watch him walk out, stunned and  open-mouthed. FADE OUT: ? 20 ? FADE IN: DAY INSERT: Dingy board sign outside a building. JOE'S LAP DISSOLVE TO: INSERT: Three column heading in newspaper: SCHUYLER HEIR SETTLES BREACH OF PROMISE SUIT FOR $10,000.

Quite a number of men  and a few women are leaning on the bar  and seated around at the tables. Stew  and Gallagher are seated at one of the  rude round tables, smoking, drinks before  them. Gallagher is reading the newspaper  story. 49. CLOSE SHOT - STEW AND GALLAGHER She is grinning at the story. STEW and she walked up to me and put her  hand on my shoulder and said, (mimicking Anne) 'Mr. Smith, You wouldn't print that  story, would you?' Oh no, I wouldn't  print it - read it! 50. CLOSE SHOT - GALLAGHER Over Stew's shoulder. She laughs at  his attempted imitation. GALLAGHER You're sure going to be poison to that  Junior Leaguer[4] from now on! STEW I hope not . . . I've got to call on  her this morning! Gallagher looks up in astonishment. GALLAGHER You what? STEW Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench.  Her wounds need soothing. GALLAGHER For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely  bats? What for? I thought the story  was cold. You can't go back there. STEW Sure, the story is cold, but I'm not.  I'm sizzling - look! Psst! ? 21 ? He moistens a finger, touches it to  his wrist, and makes a sizzle noise. Gallagher looks over quizzicallya little  suspiciousa little jealous. GALLAGHER (a drawn-out knowing utterance) O-o-oh! Came the dawn, came the dawn! 51. CLOSE SHOT - STEW Over Gallagher's shoulder. STEW And with it came love! Oh Gallagher,  you've got to meet her. She's it GALLAGHER and that STEW (enthusing) and those and them. Gallagher takes a sip of her drink before  answering. GALLAGHER Well, I've seen her pictures, and I  don't think she's so hot. STEW (disparaging gesture) Oh, you don't appreciate it. Her pictures  don't do her justice. Why, Gallagher,  she's queenly - she is queenly - and  I know queens! (continues in exaltation) And oh, has she got herself a nose -  and I know noses too. That little snozzle  of hers is the berries, I tell you.  And is she cute when she throws that  little snozzle to the high heavens! 52. DOUBLE SHOT GALLAGHER Of course I haven't got a nose. Stew gives her a hurt look. STEW (shaking his head) Sure, sure. You've got a nose, Gallagher.  You've got a nose. But there's different  women, Gallagher. You know, like brewery  horses and thoroughbreds. GALLAGHER (deliberately misunderstanding) On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her.  I wouldn't call her a brewery horse. STEW Gallagher! She's the real McCoy! ? 22 ? GALLAGHER And the rest of us are truck horses? STEW (reproachfully) There you go, talking like a woman! GALLAGHER (a trifle resentfully) Well! STEW Well, you're my pal, aren't you? Then  don't turn female on me. During these last few speeches, Gallagher  has been regarding him with a curious  expression. She loves being his pal,  but wishes he would realize she is also  a woman. 53. MEDIUM SHOT Stew seems a little resentful of her  attitude. He rises. STEW Pay that check, will you Gallagher?  I'll give it back to you some time.  Maybe. He flourishes the book of Conrad, which  has been lying on the table in front  of him, and makes a grand gesture. STEW I go now - I go with Conrad in quest  of my youth! Fry those tomatoes, will  you, Gallagher? He strikes a poseand exits. Gallagher, sits, looking after him,  considerably disturbed. 54. CLOSER SHOT - GALLAGHER Sitting, looking dismally after Stew. She opens her bag and takes out a mirror,  surveying herself with frank disapproval.  She pulls out a curl of hair before  each ear, tries to soften the severe  brim of the hat. She puts a finger to  the tip of her nose and tilts it up,  studying the effect. Then, with a sigh  of disgust, she throws mirror and bag  onto the table. LAP DISSOLVE TO: 55. INT. SCHUYLER ENTRANCE HALL - DAY  - LONG SHOT Smythe, the butler, previously introduced,  comes from the direction of the rear  of the house, and proceeds down the  long, vast hallway towards the front  door. The bell keeps ringing steadily. The butler reaches the wide front door. 56. CLOSER SHOT As the butler opens the door and reveals  Stew standing outside, hatless, a book  in his hand, a spring overcoat slightly  askew, the pockets bulging with contents.  The butler quickly tries to slam the  door in Stew's face, but Stew's right  foot comes forward with a practiced  newspaperman's gesture and he forces  his way into the room. ? 23 ? STEW (reproachfully) Now, now Jeeves.[5] Was that nice? Was  that being a gentleman, Jeeves? Was  it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't  it? SMYTHE (stiffly) The name is Smythe. STEW Smythe! Well, well, well! With a Y ,  huh? (wags his head) Congratulations! What a small world.  Brothers under livery. Shake! (he grabs the butler's hand) Now, as a Smith to a Smythe SMYTHE (glacially) Mrs. Schuyler is not at home. 57. TWO SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE STEW I know, I know. I waited outside till  she went out. She's a very nice lady,  but we don't vibrate well together. 58. MEDIUM SHOT Anne, dressed in smart sports clothes,  starts to cross thru the hall. She stops  as she sees the butler engaged in conversation  with Stew. SMYTHE (hollowly) No one's at home, sir. Anne starts walking toward them. Stew  spots her. STEW Now Jeeves, what would you call this  - 'no one'? Anne comes up to them. 59. CLOSER THREE SHOT Anne looks up and sees that the butler  is frowning and uncomfortable and addresses  him. ANNE What's wrong? SMYTHE Mrs. Schuyler left orders, Miss, that  if this person came here again, I was  to call the police. STEW That's a good idea - telephone the police.  The number is Spring 3100. Get a couple  of cops over and we can have a rubber  of bridge. ANNE You may go, Smythe. ? 24 ? SMYTHE But I STEW Now the lady said you may go The butler bows stiffly and exits. ANNE (to Stewdirectly) What do you want? STEW Well, I tell you, yesterday when I was  here, I had one of your books in my  hand, and when I got outside, I realized  I still had your book in my hand. So  as long as I had your book in my hand,  I thought I might as well take it home  and read it. This morning, I got up  and put your book in my hand, and here's  your book in your hand. He extends the Conrad book, and Anne,  making no effort to take it, he throws  it on the table. ANNE (haughty) That's considerate of you. STEW Yeah, that was considerate of me. I  recommend you read it. 60. CLOSER TWO SHOT ANNE (stiffly) I'm not interested in your literary  recommendations. STEW Well, maybe it's a bit heavy for you.  Perhaps if you'd like something lighter  - something with a touch of romance He takes a package of letters out of  his overcoat pocket held together by  a rubber band. He extracts one of them  and opens it. STEW Just listen to this (reading) Adorable Babykins Does her miss her Baby? Him sends his  booful li'l sweetums a billion oceans  full of kisses. Bobo is so lonely! ANNE (interrupting coldly) Just a moment. I don't see how that  trash could possibly concern me. Stew advances a little closer, putting  up a finger. ? 25 ? STEW (mysteriously) Ah! But you don't know who Bobo is.  And you don't know who Babykins is. ANNE I'm not interested. Smythe will open  the door. She begins to walk away. STEW (brightly) But Bobo is your brother, Michael. And  of course nobody would ever guess who  Babykins is. Anne turns and stares at him, incredulously,  for a moment. ANNE Where did you get those letters? STEW I stole them when I was interviewing  Babykins about Bobo. Anne looks up coldly. ANNE I suppose you're going to print them? STEW No - give you another guess. 61. MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT (TRUCK SHOT) The two. Anne surveys him with frank scorn and  dislike. ANNE (scornfully) Oh, I don't need another guess. It's  quite obvious. STEW So, it's obvious, huh? She turns toward the library. ANNE Will you step into the library? STEW (with alacrity) Sure, I'll take a chance. Anne walks majestically with head held  highthru the hallthru the living room  and to the library. CAMERA TRUCKING  AHEAD OF THEM. This is a very long walk  with Anne walking ahead, Stew trailing. STEW (while walking with Anne single file) You know, the Indians used to walk like  this. (pause) Except the squaw always walked in the  back ? 26 ? (pause) You know why that was? That was in case  of attack from the front. (pause) Of course, if the attack was from the  rear, she had to depend upon her papoose. (pause) Oh yes, the papooses always had bows  and arrows. (pause) Of course, if she wasn't marriedthen  she'd have to protect her own - er,  er (indicates rear with thumb over shoulder) (still walking) What country is this library in? (pause) Miss Schuyler, how about carfare back  to the front door, huh? 62. INT. SCHUYLER LIBRARY - MEDIUM SHOT Anne sweeps in, followed by Stew. She  walks directly to a desk, opens a drawer  and takes out a large check book. She  draws up a chair and seats herself. 63. CLOSE SHOT Anne at the desk, starting to fill in  the date on a blank check. ANNE What are your initials - Mr. - er 64. CLOSE SHOT - STEW Who has remained standing. He is watching  her with a peculiar expression. STEW Smith. Stewart Smith. My friends call  me Stew. It's an injustice too because  I hold my liquor all right. CONTINUATION SCENE 63 Anne writes on the check. Then she looks  up. ANNE Will - uh - five thousand be enough? 65. DOUBLE SHOT STEW For what? ANNE For the letters, of course. 66. MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT As Stew walks closer and addreses her. STEW Gee, you shouldn't do that, Miss Schuyler.  That's all right for your lawyer friend,  but you shouldn't go around thinking  you can buy people. (hands her the letters) They're yours. ? 27 ? Anne has been listening to him with  a puzzled expression, impressed by his  obvious sincerity. ANNE I don't know how to thank you. Mother'll  be so grateful - she'll probably want  to kiss you. STEW Your mother will want to kiss me? Give  me back my letters. (grabs the letters) That's the breaks I get. It's the mothers  that are always grateful to me. (with a smile, he hands the letters  back) Here. ANNE You're a peculiar person. Why the other  day I pleaded with you not to send in  that story and  (gestures with letters) 67. CLOSE TWO SHOT STEW (patiently again) I know but that was news. This is blackmail  and I don't like blackmail. Anne is regarding him with searching  scrutiny. She smiles. Her icy, belligerent  attitude has vanished. ANNE I won't even pretend it isn't a very  great favor. I wish there was something  I could do for you STEW Well, you could make this table a little  - uh - a little less wide. (he leans over closer to her) There is something you can do for me,  Miss Schuyler. The smile goes out of Anne's eyesthe  suspicion returnsshe is saying to herself\"I  was right the first time!\" STEW (engagingly) I haven't had any lunch yet. Have you  got anything in the icebox? The hard, disdainful look leaves Anne's  face as she stares at this incredible  guy with his incredible request. With  a twinkle in her eyes, she responds: ANNE Oh, you fool! LAP DISSOLVE TO: INT. SCHUYLER DINING ROOM 68. MED. FULL SHOT A lovely, sunny room, cretonne drapes  and colorful painted furniture. Stew  and Anne are sitting at the table. Anne  looks amused and ? 28 ? definitely speculative. Stew has the  manner of having lived in this house  all his life. He draws the cup of tea  to him and puts in a lump or two of  sugar. Between him and Anne on the corner of  the table is a modernistic, squatty  little tea-pot. STEW After years of research, I finally discovered  that I was the only guy in the world  who hadn't written a play, so believe  it or not, in my spare time I'm now  writing a play. 69. CLOSE TWO SHOT Anne is casually amused. ANNE Really? STEW Yeah, I haven't figured out the plot  yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village. ANNE You're a bit eccentric, aren't you? STEW Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world,  me. Only one thing wrong with me ANNE You don't wear garters! Stew helps himself to another lump of  sugar. STEW Naw, that's just a symbol of my independence. He leans closer, looking directly into  her face. STEW I'm color blind. That's what's wrong  - I'm color blind. I've been sitting  here for a half hour looking at you  and I don't know yet whether your eyes  are blue or violet. Anne smiles at this unexpected statement,  and stares at him very critically. ANNE I'm just beginning to believe that something  could be done with you. STEW Say, you could do anything with me you  wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's  me. STEW (leaning closer) Now getting back to those eyes of yours  - would you mind if I kind of got closer  so I could see them? ? 29 ? ANNE Not if you're going to lose any sleep  about it. 70. CLOSE SHOT He gets closer, takes her chin in his  hand and gets an eyeful. ANNE Now, how would you like themopen like  this? She smiles radiantly. STEW Close them both. (getting warm) Something tells me I'd better leave. During the last speech Mrs. Schuyler  enters and stops in the doorway, surveying  this astonishing scene with stupefied  indignation and rage. Anne gets quickly to her feet as Mrs.  Schuyler sails forward. MRS. SCHUYLER That's an excellent idea. ANNE Oh, hello Mother! STEW (easily) Hello - hello, Mrs. Schuyler. Come right  in. Will you have a slug of tea? He hospitably indicates the table. Mrs.  Schuyler is speechless with fury. She  does not immediately reply. Then: MRS. SCHUYLER What is this person doing here? ANNE Why Stew goes on. STEW As a matter of fact, I was just trying  to decide the color of Anne's eyes.  I can't tell whether they're blue, or  whether they're violet. What would you  say, Mrs. Schuyler? MRS. SCHUYLER (bursting) Why ANNE (quickly) Don't say it, Mother, please. Mr. Smith  came here today to do us a great favor. 71. CLOSER SHOT Anne, Mrs. Schuyler and Stew. Mrs. Schuyler,  with an effort, restraining her impulse  to yank Stew out by the collar, speaks: ? 30 ? MRS. SCHUYLER (bursting with wrath) Indeed? Perhaps he will do me a great  favor. STEW (elaborate bow) With pleasure, Madame! MRS. SCHUYLER Get out of here. ANNE (distressed) Oh, Mother! STEW (with dignity) It's all right. It's all right, Anne.  I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but  I get it. It's all right. ANNE Please go. I'll explain to Mother. He steps close to Mrs. Schuyler's side. STEW The caviar was lovely, Madam. 72. WIDER SHOT Stew starts to the door, smiles at Anne,  and remarks to Mrs. Schuyler as he passes  her: STEW You must come over and see us sometime. Mrs. Schuyler freezes in inarticulate  anger, as Stew gives a courtly bow and  exits. FADE OUT FADE IN INT. SCHUYLER DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT 73. MEDIUM SHOT Anne in a stunning evening dress is  seated, a cocktail in one hand, cigarette  in the other. Dexter Grayson, in evening  clothes, is standing before her. GRAYSON Where were you yesterday? 74. CLOSE SHOT - ANNE She has a faraway, speculative look  in her eyes. ANNE Oh, Stew and I went for a long ride. (dreamily) Dexter, is there any finishing school  we can send him to? ? 31 ? 75. CLOSE SHOT - GRAYSON GRAYSON (witheringly) Yes - Sing Sing. CONTINUATION SCENE 74 Anne. She ignores this crack. ANNE Just the same, he's going to be a different  person when I get through with him. CONTINUATION SCENE 75 Grayson. He is looking at her, deeply  disturbed. GRAYSON When you get through with him? 76. DOUBLE SHOT ANNE Yes, it'll be a very interesting experiment. GRAYSON (sneering) To make a gentleman out of a tramp? ANNE Exactly. GRAYSON Now, Anne, you remember how much it  cost to get rid of that baseball player? ANNE You don't seem to understand that this  one's different. He has brains. 77. MED. CLOSE SHOT Grayson seats himself beside her on  the divan. GRAYSON (fervently) But what about me, Anne? She looks at him coldly with almost  an expression of dislike. ANNE You? Oh, don't go serious on me, Dexter. LAP DISSOLVE TO: INT. PENTHOUSE APT. - NIGHT 78. MED. SHOT TRUCKING An elaborate, modernistic roof apartment,  thronged with people all in evening  dress. Stew and Anne are walking down  among them. Anne is radiant, and Stew  is happily guiding her among the stuffed  shirts. Anne stops before a group. There  is the sound of conversation, laughter,  clink of glasses, music from stringed  invisible orchestra, etc. ? 32 ? ANNE Hello, Natalie. Mr. Stewart Smith .  . . Miss Montgomery, Mrs. Eames, Mrs.  Radcliff, Mr. Radcliff STEW How-di-do. GROUP (ad-lib acknowledgements) 79. MED. CLOSE SHOT - DEXTER GRAYSON Standing, helping himself to a cocktail,  which a footman is passing about. Dexter  looks off with a frown of disapproval. 80. CLOSE SHOT - GROUP OF WOMEN They are looking off in Anne's direction. FIRST WOMAN Say, who's Anne's new boyfriend? SECOND WOMAN Well, if these old ears don't deceive  me, I believe his name is Smith. FIRST WOMAN Smith! Can't be one of the brothers  - he hasn't a beard on.[6] SECOND WOMAN Well, he must have something if Anne  has got her clutches on him. There is the sound of a piano chord  being struck. 81. MED. FULL SHOT Mrs. Baxter, the hostess, is standing  importantly by the grand piano at which  is seated an anaemic-looking young man.  Beside her stands a stout, swarthy Italian  with bristling mustachios. Mrs. Baxter  bows toward the swarthy one, who bends  almost double in acknowledgement. There  is a polite scattering of applause,  and some of the guests seat themselves. Martini starts to sing. Unnoticed by the rest, Stew and Anne  slip out of the door into the roof garden. EXT. ROOF GARDEN 82. MED. FULL SHOT A most beautiful, romantic spot. Rose  trees in blossom, a vine-covered pergola,  a splashing fountain, a few choice marble  statues, low, deep chairs placed to  make a gorgeous spot. Stew and Anne  enter from the direction of the house.  The garden is dark except for the lights  from the interior of the house. From  within, comes the voice of the singer  rendering an extremely romantic, sentimental  Italian love song. This will continue  to the FADE OUT of the scene. Stew and Anne walk, still hand in hand,  toward the edge of the pergola where  the shadows are deeper and where a couple  of glorified steamer chairs are placed.  There is a full moon overhead. She leads him toward a waterfall effect,  a glass partition down which water trickles.  They go behind the dimly lit fountain  and sit ? 33 ? in a low, deep divan. We see them in  silhouette as they go into a passionate  embrace. All we hear is the faint voice  of Martiniand the uninterrupted splashing  of the fountain. CUT TO: 83. CLOSEUP - ANNE & STEW On divan, arms around each other. STEW Anne, pinch me, will you? Throw me out  of here. Give me the air. Throw me out  of this joint, will you? Anne smiles happily and pinches his  nose. ANNE Why should I? We're happy, aren't we,  darling? STEW Throw me out - because I'm beginning  to get goofy ideas, and they concern  you, Anne. ANNE (passionately) None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew,  if they concern me. STEW (struggling) My name is Smith - well, that you seem  to have been able to stand for the last  month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one.  I've never been in jail - that is, not  often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon.  I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like  black coffee and I hate garters. I make  seventy-five bucks a week and I've got  eight hundred and forty-seven bucks  in the bank - and - I don't know yet  whether your eyes are blue or violet. ANNE (although he is very close to her) That's because you're too far away,  Stew. Throughout his speech, Anne never takes  her eyes off him. As he fumbles now,  he turns. Their eyes meet. His overwhelming  desire for Anne overcomes him. He dismisses as futile his effort to  be practical, sweeps her into his arms  and kisses her passionately. FADE OUT: FADE IN INT. CITY ROOM OF MORNING POST - DAY 84. MEDIUM FULL SHOT Typical atmosphere, as before. LAP DISSOLVE TO: 85. MEDIUM SHOT Featuring Stew at his desk, which is  directly in front of the battery of  Morkrums whose clatter comes into the  sound track. ? 34 ? Stew finishes up a phone call. He sits  at his desk, staring pensively at his  typewriter. He is smoking a pipe and  is in his shirt-sleeves. His hair is  rumpled, and strewn over the desk is  a bunch of crumpled up pieces of paper,  indicating that he has made numerous  unsuccessful starts at writing something.  A fresh blank sheet of paper is now  in the typewriter. Nearby, at another desk, asleep in a  swivel chair, with his feet elevated  to the desk, the low snoring of another  reporter blends with the sounds of the  Morkrums and other noises of the City  Room. At the reporter's elbow is a telephone. 86. MEDIUM SHOT Desk of Conroy, the City Editor. A small  upright plate on his desk indicates  his position. This is near the copy  desk. Characteristic activities are  background for any action that may take  place. Reporters come up to throw their  stories on Conroy's desk; the phone  rings, etc. A boy comes in with a large number of  newspapers under his arm which he throws  on Conroy's desk. There are several  copies of each of the rival newspapers  in town. Conroy spreads them out and  begins to examine them. 87. CLOSE SHOT - STEW It is evident that he is nervous and  jumpy about something. Finally he starts  to pound the typewriter. INSERT: Sheet of paper in typewriter  on which is being typed. ACT 1 SCENE 1 A STREET IN ARABY 88. CLOSE SHOT - GALLAGHER As she talks on the phone to one of  her girlfriends GALLAGHER (sotto voce) Sure I got a new dress. A new hat too.  (listens) Well, I'll try to get Stew  to come with me. (she glances in his  direction) Yeah - he's all right. You  know, he thinks he's stuck on some society  gal. (listens) Naw, it won't last. It  better not last! 89. CLOSER SHOT - CONROY Hastily glancing over the headlines  of the papers. The phone rings. Without  looking at it, Conroy answers: CONROY What? Oh, I'll be surprised, eh? Listen  if there's any news in that sheet that  I haven't thrown in the wastepaper basket,  I'll eat it. He is looking down at the papers and  suddenly his eyes focus on something  which causes the cigar to drop from  his mouth and an expression of mingled  amazement and rage comes into his face.  We do not see at this point what it  is he has read, but we know it must  be something sensational. Abruptly he  hangs up the phone. ? 35 ? CUT TO: CONTINUATION SCENE 87 Stew, as he studies his typewriter.  Over his CLOSEUP comes the excited outraged  voice of Conroy. CONROY'S VOICE Hey Stew! Stew Smith! A look of infinite weariness and disgust  comes over Stew's face and he grits  his teeth. STEW Me? His general expression registers \"Good  god, there he goes again.\" With one  finger he pounds out four letters: INSERT: Sheet in typewriter: Next to A STREET IN ARABY Stew has typed: NUTS He yanks the sheet out of the typewriter. CONTINUATION SCENE 89 Conroy. He looks over and bellows furiously. CONROY You double-crossing hound! Come over  here! CONTINUATION SCENE 87 Stew gets up from his machine, crumples  the sheet of paper into a wad and flings  it at the sleeping reporter. The wad  strikes him in the face; he wakes abruptly  and automatically reaches for the phone.  He picks up the receiver and in a voice  fogged with sleep calls a number. Stew  exits. 90. MEDIUM SHOT At Conroy's desk. Conroy's expression  is one of bitter reproach as he leans  back in his swivel chair as Stew approaches  and stands by the desk. STEW Now listen boss, if you're going to  kick about that expense account CONROY (interrupting fiercely) Do you call yourself a reporter? 91. MEDIUM SHOT Of other reporters, the older man at  the copy desk, and perhaps a sob sister  or two nearby, who look up with expectant  interest, expecting to hear Stew get  a bawling out. 92. CLOSE SHOT - GALLAGHER At her desk. She looks up worried and  apprehensive. ? 36 ? CONTINUATION SCENE 90 Stew and Conroy. STEW It has been alleged - yes CONROY You wouldn't know news if you fell into  a mess of it, nose first. So you're  the bright lad that's never been scooped! STEW (defensively) Not on my own beat, no. CONROY (howling so that he can be heard all  over the room) No? Well, where were you when that happened? He slaps the copy of the Tribune furiously  and shoves it into Stew's face. 93. CLOSE SHOT - STEW Not knowing what it is all about, Stew,  with an injured expression, takes the  paper and looks at it. INSERT: Front page of Tribune ANN SCHUYLER ELOPES WITH REPORTER (with subheads giving more explicit  information) 94. MEDIUM SHOT The other reporters, copy readers, sob  sisters, etc., seeing the unusual commotion  and Stew's bewildered reaction, get  out of their chairs and cross over to  the City Desk, where they take up other  copies of the same paper to look at.  There are amazed and excited exclamations. 95. CLOSER SHOT - STEW AND CONROY Stew, still staring dumbly at the paper.  A few others are crowding around, glancing  over his shoulder, etc. CONROY I've heard of people being scooped on  their own funerals, but this! Holy mackerel!  Why, it's news when Anne Schuyler gets  her fingernails manicured, but this!  She gets married to one of our own reporters  and the Tribune beat us to it! (he notices other reporters milling  around) Well! What do you guys want? Go on,  get back to your desks. Go back to your  work. (returning his attention to Stew) Now don't tell me you were drunk at  the time and don't remember! Or is this  one of Bingy's snow-storms? STEW No, no - it's true, all right, only  we didn't want to get it in print yet,  that's all. CONROY Why not? ? 37 ? STEW Well, you see, I've acquired one of  those new mother-in-laws, and we were  afraid she wouldn't understand the whole  idea. So we were going to wait till  she went to Europe. CONROY What do I care about your mother-in-law!  You're still working for this paper,  aren't you! Or are you? STEW Yes, sir. CONROY Well, it's your business to get news!  And here you had a story right in your  own lap and you let the Tribune scoop  us on it. Making a first class Grade  A monkey out of me. If it ever happens  again - just don't bother about coming  back. That's all. He dismisses Stew with a wave of his  hand. STEW Thanks for your congratulations. 96. MEDIUM SHOT Stew turns away from Conroy's desk,  and a group of his confreres come up,  surrounding him in a series of ad-lib  congratulations. (Some slightly profane,  pounding him on the back, whooping,  and in general manifesting great surprise  and glee.) This group is increased by  copy readers, office boys and everybody  jabbering and shouting at him. GROUP (ad-lib congratulations) Stew manages to break thru them and  exits from scene. 97. MEDIUM SHOT Gallagherto intercut with above scene.  She gets up and goes over, CAMERA PANNING  WITH HER and picks up another copy of  the paper and reads the headlines. 98. CLOSER SHOT - GALLAGHER Her face stricken and sick as she reads  about Stew's marriage. Abruptly she  turns away, out of scene. 99. MEDIUM SHOT At Gallagher's empty desk. Stew comes  in trying to stave off the mob. He turns  on the congratulators, pushing them  off. STEW What's the matter with you mugs? Can't  a guy get married without all this? (looks around) Where's Gallagher? Anybody seen Gallagher? He forcibly breaks away from them and  walks back toward the door, the last  of the wisecracks and goodnatured jeers  being flung after him. ? 38 ? LAP DISSOLVE TO: INT. JOE'S SPEAKEASY 100. MED. CLOSE SHOT Gallagher is seated alone at a table,  looking very forlorn. Her life is suddenly  empty. A drink is in front of her, untouched.  She is fighting hard to keep her emotions  under control. Stew enters the speakeasy and mingles  with patrons, who offer congratulations.  He comes to a stop by the table. She  looks up, forcing a smile. STEW Well, well, well! Gallagher, old pal!  There you are. What did you run away  for? GALLAGHER I didn't run away. Stew draws out the other chair at the  table and sits down. 101. CLOSER SHOT OF THE TWO He looks across at her, grinning boyishly,  utterly unaware that what he has done  has hurt her deeply. STEW Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going  to congratulate a guy? GALLAGHER (with sincerity) Sure. I wish you all the luck in the  world, pal. She puts her hand tenderly on his. STEW Thanks, thanks. GALLAGHER I hope you'll be very happy. Stew expands under the comradeship of  Gallagher. He wants to talk. STEW Oh sure, we'll be happy. What's the  matter with your eyes? GALLAGHER It's the smoke. STEW (calling to bartender) Joe! A little snifter. (returning his attention to Gallagher) Say, wasn't I a lucky guy to fall into  a girl like that, huh? (he notices the newspaper, which Gallagher  has been reading) Look at that! I don't know how I rate  that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's a swell  girl. I want you to meet her. ? 39 ? GALLAGHER Who me? She wouldn't want to meet me.  I'm just an old load of hay. 102. CLOSE SHOT - STEW As his drink is served. STEW Ah! Thank you, Joe. (returning his attention to Gallagher) Tell you what - we'll have one of those  parties down at your house - one of  those spaghetti parties, you know. Gee,  we haven't had one of those in a long  time, have we Gallagher? 103. CLOSE SHOT OF THE TWO GALLAGHER (quietly) Not since you broke into society. STEW (waxing reminiscent) Remember the time we had a spaghetti  party, and while I was serving the spaghetti  I dropped it on the floor, and while  those mugs weren't looking, I picked  it up and served it to them anyway!  Remember that? Yes, Anne would love  that. 104. CLOSE SHOT - GALLAGHER Looking across at him. GALLAGHER Do you think your wife would walk up  three flights of stairs just to eat  out of paper plates? 105. DOUBLE SHOT STEW Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that. GALLAGHER Remember, she's a Schuyler. STEW Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's  the name. GALLAGHER (murmurs) My error. STEW Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll  come down alone. GALLAGHER (shaking her head) Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're  a married man now. Mother always warned  me never to run around with married  men. ? 40 ? STEW (resentfully) Say, what kind of a pal are you? You're  not going to leave me flat? Gallagher tries to be elaborately casual. GALLAGHER Oh, I'll call you up some time. And  if your social duties permit - why - STEW Cut that out. Just because I'm married  - there's no reason for that. Gallagher looks up and off, seeing something  that startles her. 106. MED. SHOT Conroy, the City Editor, entering the  speakeasy. CONTINUATION SCENE 105 Stew and Gallagher. GALLAGHER (interrupting in a whisper) Hey, ixnay - here's the ossbay.[7] Stew looks around, also startled. 107. MED. SHOT Stew buries his head in the newspaper,  in pretense of looking for something.  Conroy appears at the table and stops.  He indicates Stew. CONROY What's the Benedict[8] looking for in  the newspaper - his lost freedom? Stew slowly sticks his head up over  the top of the table, looking up. STEW (grinning sheepishly) Well, if it isn't old Fagin[9] himself. Conroy sits down at the table. STEW Gallagher and myself just came over  here to do a little work on a story  - CONROY (disgustedly) Baloney! (calls off) Joe! Bring me a special! 108. CLOSER THREE SHOT Gallagher tries to be very bright and  smiling. GALLAGHER (to Conroy) Isn't it swell about Stew's marriage? ? 41 ? CONROY (looking straight at her) Is it? Gallagher, self-conscious, realizes  this tough old buzzard is on to her.  She looks back at him for a moment -  then drops her head. Stew is oblivious  to this by-play. Conroy turns to Stew. CONROY Well, when are you quitting? STEW Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting. Joe comes in with a drink for Conroy. CONROY I take it you don't have to work for  a living any more He takes a sip of his drink and looks  over meaningfully. CONROY Mr. Schuyler . STEW (in a flash of anger) Now get this, Conroy. My name is Smith.  Always was Smith - and always gonna  be Smith. CONROY Is that so? STEW That's so. 109. CLOSEUP - CONROY He shows that he is genuinely interested  in Stew and his problems, but can't  help being a little sarcastic. CONROY Anne Schuyler's in the Blue Book - you're  not even in the phone book. Think that  one over, sucker. CAMERA PANS to CLOSEUP of GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER (quickly in Stew's defense) That doesn't make any difference (quietly) if they love each other. CAMERA PANS BACK to CLOSEUP of CONROY. CONROY Blah! It's like a giraffe marrying a  monkey. (looking off at Stew) Listen - you'll never be anything but  just the reporter that married the Schuyler's  millions. Stew Smith is dead and buried.  From now on, you'll be just Anne Schuyler's  husband. A rich ? 42 ? wife's magnolia. If you can smoke that  without getting sick, you're welcome  to it. CAMERA PANS to CLOSEUP of STEW: GALLAGHER'S VOICE But that's perfectly ridiculous. STEW (defensively) Wait a minute. Now, Gallagher, let me  do the talking. Get this, Conroy - Anne  Schuyler has got a lot of dough, all  right - and I married her, all right  - but her dough and me? No connection. 110. MED. CLOSE THREE SHOT Gallagher is looking fixedly at Stew  - very much worried about Conroy's dismal  prophecies. Conroy shakes his head in  sorrowful gloom. CONROY (as if he had not heard Stew) Just a boid in a gilded cage -[10] STEW A what? CONROY You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage. STEW Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap  tabloids. Anne and myself are going  to move downtown in a nice little flat,  we're gonna forget all about this social  stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr.  and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like  that? CONROY (sarcasm) And live on your salary, I suppose? STEW Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until  I finish writing my play. CONROY (snorts) What play? STEW My play. CONROY The one about the Siberian bloodhound? STEW Siberian bloodhound? No. That's been  all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now. CONROY Araby? STEW Sure. ? 43 ? CONROY Araby, my eye! 111. WIDER SHOT Conroy, having finished his drink, pushes  back his chair and rises. He puts an  affectionate hand on Stew's shoulder. CONROY Well, I'm sorry to see a good reporter  go blooey (starts away) Let me know when you're quitting. STEW I'm not quitting! CONROY No? STEW No! CONROY (singing) 'For he's only a bird in a gilded cage,  a beautiful sight to see' (he waves his hand) Tweet, tweet - ha, ha He laughs loud and raucously and exits. 112. CLOSE SHOT - STEW AND GALLAGHER Stew glares after Conroy. STEW (under his breath) Laugh - laugh, you hyena! Gallagher realizes that Conroy has hit  home with the truth and is sorry for  Stew. She puts her hand over his sympathetically. GALLAGHER Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He  doesn't know what he's talking about. STEW Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention  to him. You think that guy could get  me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a  tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't  know the fine things in life - that  guy. (he swirls his drink, thinking) A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting  so a guy can't step out without being  called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia!  Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around  and be a speakeasy rat all my life!  I'll tell you that. Not me, not me.  I'm going to step out and mean something  in this world. You watch me. (he swirls his drink, clearly bothered,  lost in his own thoughts) Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne  Schuyler? I've been hit with a carload  of horseshoes, and believe me I know  it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky! ? 44 ? (pause) Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher? GALLAGHER Sure - I think so, Stew. STEW I knew you would, pal. (clearly bothered) A bird in a gilded cage, eh? GALLAGHER How is her family going to feel about  it? STEW Her family? Oh, they'll be all right.  I'll bring them around. (swirling his drink) Gilded cage?! Besides, I'm not marrying  her family. Stew Smith in a gilded cage!  Stew Smith? Ha! (clearly bothered) That mug. What does he know? LAP DISSOLVE TO: INT. SCHUYLER DRAWING ROOM - DAY 113. MED. FULL SHOT Another jury scene. This time it is  Anne who's on the carpet. Grayson, in  correct afternoon attire, his hands  behind his back and his head sunk, is  pacing back and forth in a very depressed  and gloomy fashion. Anne is seated, her demeanor betokening  sullen defiance. Michael is pacing, nervously smoking  a cigarette. MICHAEL I don't know what you need me here for  - it isn't my funeral. Mrs. Schuyler stands by a table, staring  at a spreadout newspaper which is laid  out on the table. She flings the newspaper  aside. MRS. SCHUYLER You stay right here, Michael. Some day  you'll be head of this family, but thank  heaven I shan't be here when it happens.  And I hope you never have a daughter  who gives you gastritis as Anne has  me! She pulls the bell rope for the butler. ANNE Now Mother, calm yourself. There's no  use in getting so excited. 114. MEDIUM SHOT Mrs. Schuyler is vastly agitated. MRS. SCHUYLER Oh, isn't there? ? 45 ? (as Anne starts to get up) Sit down! (looking off) Smythe! The butler appears in the doorway. MRS. SCHUYLER (in a weak, agonized voice) Some bicarbonate - quick! SMYTHE Double strength! The butler bows and exits. She passes  a nervous hand over her eyes. Anne comes  up to her. ANNE Mother, if you keep this up, you'll  have a nervous breakdown before you  go to Europe. 115. CLOSER SHOT Anne, Grayson and Mrs. Schuyler. MRS. SCHUYLER It's a good thing your father passed  away before he saw insanity ravage the  family. I can't imagine what made you  do such a thing. A reporter! Of all  things, a reporter! A barbarian who  lets his socks come down! ANNE Mother, I promise you that he won't  be a reporter much longer. Once I get  him away from that atmosphere and get  him away from a man named Gallagher MRS. SCHUYLER (as Anne starts to get up again) Sit down! 116. WIDER SHOT The butler enters with a tray on which  is a glass of bicarbonate of soda and  brings it to Mrs. Schuyler. Walking  immediately behind the butler is Stew,  airily debonair. The butler glances  somewhat uneasily at Mrs. Schuyler as  he presents the tray. She glares blackly  at Stew without a word of greeting,  and taking the foaming glass from the  tray, starts to lift it to her lips. STEW (airily) Drink hearty, Mother. Once more, Anne starts to rise out of  her seat. MRS. SCHUYLER Anne! Mrs. Schuyler pauses - glowering at  Stew. Stew nods perfunctorily to each  member of the jury, the total innocent. STEW Hello, Anne. Mr. Grayson. ? 46 ? (to Michael) And you. (to Mrs. Schuyler) Mrs. Schuyler! Grayson does not acknowledge the greeting.  Mrs. Schuyler, having drained the glass,  dismisses the butler with a wave of  the hand, and directs her attention  again to the matter at hand. MRS. SCHUYLER (in command) Well, what's to be done? He's here now. They are all silent - reluctant to speak  in front of Stew. Stew looks at them  all - a little puzzled - then he walks  over toward Mrs. Schuyler. 117. MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT Mrs. Schuyler and Stew. STEW Nobody seems to want to do anything (to Mrs. Schuyler, brightly) Why not ask me? Perhaps I can offer  a suggestion. Do what about what? MRS. SCHUYLER (witheringly) About what? Your marriage to Anne! STEW (with a tone of dismissal) Oh, my marriage to Anne. Now Mrs. Schuyler,  we don't want you to go to any trouble  about that. We just want the usual blessings,  that's all. 118. MEDIUM SHOT Mrs. Schuyler's eyes flash. She draws  herself up with haughty dignity. MRS. SCHUYLER Young man, I want you to know that I  object violently to this whole affair! This finally brings Anne out of her  seat. She rises and crosses to Stew,  making a show of embracing him. ANNE Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly  ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and  I are married. STEW (to Mrs. Schuyler) I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler.  I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler,  that you feel this way. I was in hopes  that you would like me. I'm not the  burglar that you think I am. After all,  we're married. I think the thing to  do is to kiss and make up - Mother. MRS. SCHUYLER (furiously) Stop calling me Mother! ? 47 ? STEW (easily) All right, Grandma MRS. SCHUYLER (glaring) This man's impossible! I can't talk  to him. Grayson, let's go where we can  talk - hic! (she emits a burp, then fixes a glacial  look at Anne) See what you've done to me!? Without another word, she turns and  flounces angrily out of the room. Grayson  follows her. At the doorway he pauses,  starts to say something. They all look  at him expectantly - but no words come  out. STEW Got it too, huh? Grayson gives a harrumph and exits. 119. CLOSER MEDIUM SHOT Anne, Michael and Stew. Michael grins  at Stew. MICHAEL Who won that round? Michael starts moving toward the door. STEW (ruefully) I'm afraid your mother won that round  - that is, she got in the last blow. MICHAEL I don't feel the way they do. You're  really not as bad as everybody thinks. STEW (effusively - shaking his hand) You're beginning to appreciate me, eh?  Thanks! MICHAEL Don't worry too much about Mother -  she's enjoying this. Come on upstairs,  I'll give you a little - He indicates a snifter, grins and exits.  Anne crosses to Stew and puts her arm  around his shoulder. STEW (to Michael) A little? Sure, I'll be right up. (to Anne) He's all right. I like him. ANNE I'm glad. He sees two figures pass above in a  proscenium alcove, first Mrs. Schuyler,  then Grayson. He makes an elaborate  bow to each, and is impressed by Grayson's  return bow. ? 48 ? STEW He can bend! 120. CLOSER SHOT Anne takes a step backwards and sits  down with him on one of the divans.  CAMERA TILTING DOWN WITH THEM. He puts  an arm about her. ANNE Come here baby! Anne starts fussing abstractedly at  Stew's tie. They kiss. ANNE I haven't seen you for three hours.  You're neglecting me already During her speech she has been picking  away at a stain on his tie. Stew looks  down and notices it. STEW What's the matter? Something I et, no  doubt. Egg marks the spot ANNE You ought to get some new ties, Stewart. STEW I don't need any new ties. I've got  another tie - I've got another one besides  this one. And it's a pip, too. There's  only one thing wrong with it. You know  what that is? It has a little weakness  for gravy, and once in a while it leans  a little toward ketchup. Of course that's  only in its weaker moments. When you  move down to my place, I'll show it  to you. Anne is somewhat taken aback at the  suggestion that she's to move into his  place. ANNE Your place? 121. TWO SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE STEW Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't  compare with this coliseum of yours  here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill  serve. (elaborate) The architecture has a little feeling  of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture  sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance  - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids. ANNE (gently insistent) Don't you think it's silly of us to  think of living there when we have this  whole big house STEW When 'we' . . .? You mean, you'd like  to have me live here in your house? ? 49 ? Anne cuddles closer into his collar. ANNE Sure. We can have the whole left wing  and be all by ourselves all the time. Stew is slightly dazed. 122. CLOSEUP - STEW He is slightly dazed. STEW (cynically) We could have the whole left wing? Wouldn't  that be nice! Would that be room enough  for us? 123. TWO SHOT ANNE (seriously - missing his sarcasm) Oh darling, of course it would. If it  isn't - there are six rooms and two  baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother  will give us the blue room too, I think. STEW Oh, Mother will give us the blue room.  You haven't a red room, have you? Well,  bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice!  My, oh my - six rooms and two baths  and a blue room. I guess she would let  us have the right wing if we needed  it, wouldn't she? ANNE But we don't need it, I'm sure. STEW I see, we won't need that. Plenty of  room, plenty of room. 124. WIDER SHOT He gets up and paces the floor. He looks  at Anne and sees that she is taking  him seriously. He drops down beside  her. STEW (dropping his kidding) Look Anne, you're not serious about  this, are you? ANNE Of course I am Stewart. 125. CLOSER TWO SHOT STEW Now let's get this settled She cuddles closer, tweaking his nose. ANNE You have the cutest nose I've ? 50 ? STEW Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump  do you think I am? You think I'm going  to live here in your house - on your  dough? What do you think my friends  would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get  the razzing of my life for that. 'A  bird in a gilded cage' - that's what  I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not me! ANNE What do you think my friends would say  if they found me in a little cheap flat? STEW It isn't cheap. It's nice. ANNE (cuddling closer) Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about  things like that now STEW Wait a minute. I'll do anything you  ask me, Anne, but I will not live ANNE (cuddling closer - and stroking his  nose) Oh, I love that nose. It's such a sweet  nose. They kiss. STEW Nevertheless, whether the nose is sweet  or not, I'm not going to live in your  house. You may as well get that straight. They kiss again, longer. STEW You do want me to be happy, don't you?  Then I'm not going to live in your house  . . . They continue to kiss as . . . LAP DISSOLVE TO: INT. STEW'S BEDROOM - MORNING 126. CLOSE SHOT - STEW In bed, asleep, all curled up, his head  on his arm. CAMERA TRUCKS BACK showing  the magnificent bedroom, with carved  wooden panellings, a raised, canopied  bed. The clothes that Stew has taken  off the night before are draped haphazardly  about the room. When the Camera gets  to a point that takes in a LONG SHOT  of the room, the door to the hall opens  and a correctly attired valet appears.  He closes the door noiselessly, goes  over to the windows, and draws the brocaded  drapes aside. Then he crosses to a covered  object and with a small flourish removes  the cover - revealing a birdcage. He  approaches the bed. 127. CLOSER SHOT As Dawson the valet stops beside the  bed. The valet leans over and speaks  distinctly. DAWSON Mr. Smith, sir There is no movement from the form on  the bed. ? 51 ? DAWSON Mr. Smith, sir! Still no response. The valet taps the  bedclothes-shrouded shoulder gently. DAWSON Mr. Smith, sir Sleepily, Stew turns, his eyes heavy  with sleep. 128. MEDIUM SHOT DAWSON How do you like your bath, sir? STEW I like my bath all right. How do you  like your bath? Stew peers up, puzzled. STEW Who are you? DAWSON (surprised) I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name,  sir. STEW You're my what? DAWSON Your valet, sir. Stew still stares at him. Then he nods  to himself - thinks he gets the idea.  Stew kicks back the covers and sits  on the edge of the bed in his pajamas.  Still sitting on the edge of the bed,  he starts to slip his feet into a pair  of slippers. The valet bends on one  knee to help him. STEW Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'll  do that for you some time. That's very  sweet. Say listen, what did you say  your name was? DAWSON Dawson, sir. STEW Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night? DAWSON Drunk, sir? Stew rises and starts to reach for a  dressing gown, but again the valet beats  him to it - holding it for him and helping  him slip into it. STEW Yes. I must have been pretty much plastered  if I hired a valet. DAWSON Oh, but you didn't engage me, sir. ? 52 ? Stew, surprised, turns on him quickly. STEW Who did engage you then, if I didn't  engage you? What are you doing with  my pants The valet picks up his pants. STEW Did you take anything out of those pants? DAWSON Oh no, sir! STEW What are you doing fooling around in  here? DAWSON Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith -  she engaged me this morning, sir. Stew pulls out a cigarette. The valet,  without missing a beat, leans over and  offers a light. A wary Stew accepts. STEW Hmmm. So Mrs. Smith engaged me a valley,  huh? That's very nice of Mrs. Smith  - to engage me a valley. 129. WIDER SHOT Stew walks over and gets a cigarette  out of a box on a small table, waving  his hand in a gesture of dismissal.  The valet is right behind him, holding  up his bathrobe for Stew to step into. STEW (putting on the bathrobe) Say, you are nice. You're all right.  You'd make a good wife. DAWSON Thank you, sir. STEW But not for me! Though I like you well  enough. You're a nice fellow. You're  all right. But I'm sorry I don't need  any valleys today. The valet pays no attention to him,  but walks around the room, picking up  the clothes that Stew has flung about. DAWSON Oh, but indeed you do, sir, if you don't  mind my saying so. A gentleman's gentleman,  as it were. Someone to draw your bath,  lay out your clothes, help to dress  you - it's really most essential, sir. Stew, with his cigarette between his  lips, stands watching the valet as he  retrieves the various articles of cast-off  clothing. The valet's manner is somewhat  patronizing. He walks over to a chifferobe  and starts opening the drawers, preparatory  to laying out fresh things for Stew.  Suddenly, Stew stalks over to him, takes  him by the shoulder, and yanks him around  to face him. ? 53 ? 130. CLOSER SHOT - STEW AND DAWSON The valet is astonished and somewhat  alarmed at the belligerent expression  on Stew's face. STEW (over-sweetly) Are you trying to tell me that I need  someone to help me put on my pants and  button them up? DAWSON Quite so. Quite. STEW Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts.  But I don't need anybody to help me  button my pants - I've been buttoning  my pants for thirty years all right,  and I can button 'em with one hand as  a matter of fact. DAWSON Now Mr. Smith, now please Stew is rapidly losing his temper. STEW You've got a nice face, Dawson, you  wouldn't want anything to happen to  your face, would you? The valet puts a bewildered hand to  his face. DAWSON Oh no, sir Stew releases him with a definite motion  toward the door. STEW All right, outside! DAWSON (bewildered) I beg your pardon, sir? STEW (gesturing violently) Outside! The valet gazes at Stew as if he thinks  the man is insane. He is considerably  alarmed. DAWSON I think I understand, sir. You mean  you want me to go? STEW (smiling admiringly) There you are. You caught on. You see,  you're nice and you're smart too. You  caught on right away. Outside! Go on!  Outside! And don't come back! 131. MEDIUM SHOT The valet starts edging toward the door. ? 54 ? DAWSON No, sir. No! Stew's eyes bulge as he notices the  birdcage for the first time. STEW Wait a minute, what's this? INSERT: Birdcage. BACK TO SCENE: DAWSON That's a canary, sir. STEW That's a canary! Who brought that in  here? Canary, huh? Go on, get that out  of here. Get that out of here! DAWSON (frightened) Yes, sir. Very good, sir. STEW (ranting) A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get  that thing out of here! DAWSON Yes sir! The valet hurries off, carrying the  birdcage. As he nears the door, there  is a light tap on the door connecting  Stew's room and Anne's. The door opens  and Anne comes in, wearing a ravishing  and revealing negligee. She carries  a small jeweler's box in her hand. She  crosses the room toward Stew. ANNE Good morning, darling. She looks over and sees Dawson at the  hall door. ANNE Oh, Dawson, see that all Mr. Smith's  clothes go to the cleaners this morning,  please, will you? The valet bows. Stew looks at her blankly. DAWSON Very good, madame. He closes the door discreetly and goes  out. 132. CLOSER SHOT - ANNE AND STEW As they hug. STEW Say, who is this mug? Anne sits down on the rumpled bed. ? 55 ? ANNE I've got a present. Shut your eyes.  Keep 'em closed. I know you're going  to love them. STEW (eyes closed, feeling the package) Little - couldn't be an automobile,  could it? (he opens the package) Well, well! Ain't that nice! He holds them up - expensive garters. ANNE Do you like them? STEW Got my initials on them too. They're  cute. They're nice little things - what  do you do with them? ANNE You wear them of course, silly. STEW Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn  these things for Years. ANNE I know that. STEW Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't  look Gallagher in the face. ANNE Darling, I don't care whether you can  look Gallagher in the face or not, but  you're gonna be a good boy and wear  garters. STEW Honey, I love you. I'll eat spinach  for you. I'll go to the dentist twice  a year for you. I'll wash behind my  ears for you. But I will never wear  garters! His arms go about Anne. Under the force  of his embrace Anne sinks back on the  pillows. Stew leans forward looking  down at her. 133. CLOSE TWO SHOT - STEW AND ANNE Nose to nose. ANNE (adopting a sing-song) Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you  will my dear - you'll wear garters and  you'll like it too! STEW (picking up her sing-song) Oh, no I won't my dear - oh, no I won't  my dear - I'll wash behind my ears,  but no I won't my dear! He bends to kiss her again, but she  gently resists, and continues the sing-song. ? 56 ? ANNE Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you  will my dear - you'll eat spinach but  you'll wear garters too! STEW Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't  carry a tune - all you are good for  is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I  won't wear garters ANNE Oh yes you will wear garters They melt into each other's arms. LAP DISSOLVE TO: INT. CITY ROOM OF NEWSPAPER OFFICE -  DAY 134. MEDIUM FULL SHOT General activity, as before. CAMERA TRUCKS DOWN THE MAIN AISLE until  it centers on Stew at his desk, sitting  low in his chair, his feet cocked up  on the corner of his desk, reading a  newspaper CAMERA TRUCKS UP CLOSER centering on  his feet on the desk. One trouser leg  is pulled slightly up and reveals a  garter. 135. MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT Stew, reading the newspaper. It is opened  up before his face. INSERT: Headlines - about a three-column  article: ANNE SCHUYLER AND CINDERELLA HUBBY TO  OCCUPY SCHUYLER MANSION As Stew reads this, he looks very glum  and depressed. 136. MEDIUM SHOT A reporter, the one Stew had socked  with a wad of paper in an earlier sequence,  shambles past and stops abruptly, staring  at Stew's feet. INSERT: Of what he sees. Stew's feet.  The socks are strangely taut. BACK TO SCENE: The reporter glances up and sees that  Stew cannot see him, and then carefully  lifts Stew's trouser leg a few inches. INSERT: Stew's feet and legs. As the  reporter's hand lifts the trouser leg,  the fancy solid-gold garters are on  full display. BACK TO SCENE: The reporter stares at them goggle-eyed.  He can hardly contain himself at the  sight of the garters. He looks off: REPORTER (cautiously) Psst! 137. WIDER SHOT One or two other reporters hear him  and look over curiously. The reporter  looks very mysterious and important  and makes a motion for silence and caution.  They get up and cross on tip-toe to  join him. ? 57 ? 138. MEDIUM SHOT The men around Stew. They quietly gather  around his feet and the reporter who  made the discovery proudly displays  his find. One or two more step by and  all stare. Stew still has the paper  up in front of his face. FIRST REPORTER Is it real? 2ND REPORTER Of course it's real! 3RD REPORTER Any diamonds on them? REPORTER Musta set him back at least six bits.[11] 139. MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT Stew. (Camera behind him and shooting  over his head.) He is suddenly attracted  by this unusual conversation and lowers  his paper, revealing the group of six  or seven men in a huddle round his feet. 2ND REPORTER One just can't wear those and be decent. 3RD REPORTER Yes you can, if you belong to the Four  Hundred.[12] 2ND REPORTER I wonder what number he is. Stew flares in anger. Several of them  are bending low to get a close peek.  With a violent gesture, Stew kicks his  foot forward and sends a couple of them  sprawling. Stew gets to his feet. STEW Go on, get out of there! What's the  matter with you mugs? Didn't you ever  see a guy with a pair of garters on  before? 140. MEDIUM SHOT The two reporters who have done most  of the talking scramble to their feet.  The second reporter speaks in mock perplexity. REPORTER What do you suppose he wears them for? 2ND REPORTER Can it be possible to hold his socks  up? 3RD REPORTER Yeah, exactly. (effeminately) You know, one's hose look horribly untidy  when they hang loose-like, don't you  think so, percifield? Stew gets up as his phone rings. He  pays no attention to it. Hank, another  reporter, answers. ? 58 ? 4TH REPORTER (same effeminacy) Yes, my dear chap - they look ghastly  - they look ghastly! STEW Go on! Screw! Get out of here! He starts out when Hank calls to him: HANK Hey, Stew! Stew turns. HANK (indicating phone) Your policeman! Stew comes back and, frowning, picks  up the phone. 141. CLOSE SHOT Stew at phone. STEW Hello? Oh hello dear. Wait just a minute (to reporters, hovering around) Come on! Beat it, will you? Screw! Screw!  This is my wife! In your respective  chapeaux and over your cauliflower ears. REPORTERS (ad-lib teasing comments as they exit  scene) INT. ANNE'S BEDROOM 142. CLOSEUP - ANNE She is lying on her stomach on a rubbing  table, as used by a masseuse. We see  a considerable part of her back, on  which a middle-aged Swedish masseuse  is industriously working. Anne has the  telephone in her hand. Throughout her  scene, we hear very telling whacks: ANNE (into phone) But it's nearly six o'clock darling,  and you know how long it takes you to  dress. (pause) But the Ambassador is coming at eight,  and you've got to be ready by the time  he gets here. LAP DISSOLVE TO: EXT. SCHUYLER LONG ISLAND ESTATE 143. LONG SHOT OF ESTATE DISSOLVE INTO: 144. EXT. FRONT ENTRANCE GATE Two footmen stand at either side of  a huge iron gate. Cars and limousines  are arriving, dropping off guests in  evening wear. INT. CORRIDOR SCHUYLER HOME 145. Gallagher is just entering. Smythe  holds door open for her. ? 59 ? GALLAGHER I'd like to see Miss Wilson, please. SMYTHE Who shall I say, madam? GALLAGHER Miss Gallagher of the Post. SMYTHE Yes, miss. He leaves. 146. INT. SCHUYLER RECEPTION HALL MOSS AND FONTANA are doing a beautiful  tango. Guests scattered around the room,  watching interestedly. CUT BACK TO: 147. INT. CORRIDOR SCHUYLER HOME Gallagher is still waiting. Smythe enters,  leading Miss Wilson, a refined-looking  girl of 26 or so, her hand extended. SMYTHE Miss Gallagher of the Post. MISS WILSON Oh yes - of course. Miss Gallagher? GALLAGHER Yes. MISS WILSON I'm Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler's social  secretary. GALLAGHER I was sent from the Post in place of  our social editor. MISS WILSON Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned  me. Well, what would you like to have? GALLAGHER Why, a list of the guests. That's the  usual thing, isn't it? MISS WILSON Yes, of course. I'll get it for you (smiling) In the meantime, would you like to take  a look around? GALLAGHER Yes, thank you. The CAMERA MOVES WITH THEM as they start  for the Reception Room. MISS WILSON That's a lovely dress. ? 60 ? GALLAGHER Thank you. (pause) Where is Mr. Smith? MISS WILSON Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's  husband? GALLAGHER Yes. MISS WILSON He's probably very tired. You see, he's  had to meet all these people personally  tonight. GALLAGHER I bet. MISS WILSON You newspaper people have a lot of fun  with him, don't you? What is it you  call him - the Cinderella Man? CUT TO: 148. INT. ENTRANCE OF BALLROOM Moss and Fontana are just finishing  their dance. Gallagher stands in doorway  with Miss Wilson, watching them. Excited  voices comment on the dance. Miss Wilson  beckons to Gallagher to follow her. CAMERA TRUCKS with them as they weave  in and out of crowd. Miss Wilson points  out celebrated guests to her. MISS WILSON There's the Spanish Ambassador. Gallagher steals a glance at the celebrated  gentleman. GALLAGHER You know, he looks like one. Miss Wilson laughs delightedly. At this  point they are interrupted by a butler. 149. MEDIUM SHOT BUTLER Miss Wilson MISS WILSON Yes? BUTLER Mrs. Smith would like to see you. MISS WILSON (to Gallagher) Will you excuse me? Make yourself at  home for just a moment, please. GALLAGHER Thanks. ? 61 ? Miss Wilson follows butler out of scene.  Gallagher is left alone. She wanders  about the huge ballroom, peering here  and there, searching for Stew. Finally  she comes to a large open French door  and steps out. 150. INT. TERRACE LEADING OFF SCHUYLER  BALLROOM Several groups of men and women are  seated at tables. Gallagher enters from  ballroom, glances quickly at all the  men. Disappointed at not finding Stew,  she crosses terrace and descends broad  stone steps and advances into garden. 151. INT. SECLUDED SPOT IN GARDEN Stew, his head cupped in his hands,  is seated on a stone bench. Gallagher  wanders into scene. She sees Stew and  stops. Stew does not move. Gallagher,  with a happy smile on her lips, moves  closer to him. Stew suddenly becomes  conscious of someone near him and looks  suddenly up. He sees Gallagher; his  face breaks into a happy grin. GALLAGHER Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays  and I'd like an autograph. STEW Well, well! If it isn't my old friend!  Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at  you. GALLAGHER There you are! 152. CLOSER SHOT OF THE TWO STEW Well, daughter of the slums - how did  you get out of the ghetto? GALLAGHER I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor  tonight. I wanted to see some life in  the raw. STEW Aw, you wanted to see some life in the  raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't  got no raw life up here. GALLAGHER Well, I'll have to look someplace else. STEW No, no! Maybe we could interest you  in some well done butterflies, or perhaps  some slightly fried pansies, or better  still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed  every one of them will give you a good  stiff pain in the neck. GALLAGHER (fixing his tie) Say, who's been tying your ties lately?  It looks rotten. He suddenly realizes there's something  different about Gallagher. He takes  a step back so as to look her over carefully  - blinks his eyes. ? 62 ? STEW Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What  are you doing to yourself? GALLAGHER Nothing. STEW What did you do to that hair? And where  did you get that dress? GALLAGHER I dyed one and washed the other. STEW (enthusiastically) Oh, you dyed one and washed the other.  Well! You certainly look good. 153. ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDEN Anne is walking in direction of Stew  and Gallagher. She stops suddenly when  she sees them. Her body stiffens. CUT BACK TO: ANOTHER SHOT - STEW AND GALLAGHER From Anne's angle. Gallagher is facing  in the direction of Anne. GALLAGHER Don't turn around now - but there's  a very beautiful girl up there who seems  to be staring at us. STEW Staring at us? GALLAGHER My mistake - she's glaring. STEW Must be my wife. He turns - sees Anne. STEW It is my wife. Hi Anne. Don't go away.  Stay right there, because I'm going  to bring a friend up I want you to meet. They exit. 154. MED. CLOSE SHOT - ANNE Standing as before. She is looking off  with slightly narrowed eyes. Stew and  Gallagher come up to her. STEW Anne, prepare yourself for the treat  of your life. This is Gallagher. ANNE (astounded) Gallagher! ? 63 ? STEW Sure - my pal on the paper. She's subbing  for the society editor tonight. Anne turns an acid smile on the uncomfortable  Gallagher. 155. CLOSER THREE SHOT ANNE Oh, yes, of course. How do you do? STEW Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith. Anne winces slightly at this name. GALLAGHER How do you do? There is a short, awkward pause. ANNE (bitter-sweet) You know, Stewart, you failed to mention  that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful  young girl. STEW Gallagher? Gallagher flashes a look at Stew - seeing  that he fails to get the dynamite behind  Anne's casually pleasant phrases. Anne  plunges ahead. Her tone is unmistakable  now. ANNE Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed  to mention that Gallagher was a girl. STEW (surprised) Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny? ANNE (with a world of meaning) Yes - isn't it? 156. CLOSE SHOT - STEW AND ANNE Stew is beginning to realize that all  is not well as it could be. STEW You see, we never look at Gallagher  as a girl He breaks off. ANNE (with her eyes on Gallagher) No? What do you look upon her as? STEW (fumbling for words) Why, down at the office, we always look  at Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher,  that's all. CAMERA PANS QUICKLY TO CLOSE SHOT of  GALLAGHER. She tries to back Stew up. ? 64 ? GALLAGHER (not so comfortable herself) They all consider me just as one of  the boys. STEW Right! 157. MED. SHOT OF THE THREE ANNE (a deadly acid smile) Indeed? How interesting. GALLAGHER (same kind of smile) Yes - isn't it. Anne takes Stew's arm, drawing him away  from Gallagher. ANNE Miss Wilson will give you the guest  list and any other details you may need,  Miss Gallagher. GALLAGHER (resenting the tone of dismissal) Thank you. I'll go and look for her  at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith. ANNE Goodbye, Miss Gallagher. GALLAGHER Goodbye, Stew She leaves scene. 158. MED. CLOSE SHOT - STEW AND ANNE Stew turns and faces her. STEW That was kind of a rotten thing to do,  Anne. After all, Gallagher is my friend.  The least you can do is be courteous  to her. ANNE I thought I was very charming, Stewart. STEW You did? That's a lot of hooey! I'll  go and apologize. He promptly walks away from her in Gallagher's  direction. ANNE (furious) Stewart, please! She glares angrily at the departing  Stew. EXT. TERRACE 159. CLOSE SHOT Gallagher has just reached the ballroom  when Stew catches up to her. ? 65 ? STEW I'm sorry, Gallagher - really, I am  sorry. GALLAGHER (reassuringly) Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it.  As far as she's concerned, I'm just  part of the hired help. STEW No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne  act that way before. (pause) It's funny  I never thought to tell her you were  a girl, isn't it? GALLAGHER Yes. INT. SCHUYLER ENTRANCE HALL 160. MED. CLOSE SHOT The butler is just opening the door.  Bingy, looking more disreputable than  usual, steps inside. BINGY Hello, there, Meadows![13] SMYTHE (disapproving once-over) Who is it you wish to see, sir? BINGY I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse  me - I mean Mr. Smith. SMYTHE Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We  are having a reception here this evening BINGY Oh, a party! Great, great! Jolly times  and merry pranks. That's me. I'm a guy  who loves parties. You know He is distracted by two elegantly-dressed  ladies strolling by. BINGY a beautiful pair of shoulders! But  listen now, as a favor, will you please  make it snappy, Laughing Waters,[14]  and tell Stew Smith I gotta see him  because if you don't my whole family's  going to die. SMYTHE I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have  a seat. BINGY Well, I got a seat, but I have no place  to put it. The butler turns to leave, then turns  back, his face expressing distinct disapproval. SMYTHE Pardon me, sir, but I've heard that  one before. ? 66 ? INT. SCHUYLER BALLROOM 161. CLOSE SHOT Stew and Gallagher standing together.  The butler is seen leaving the scene,  having just informed Stew of Bingy's  presence at the reception. STEW (to Gallagher) Excuse me. I just want to make sure  and see he doesn't take away any of  the vases. (starts to leave, then turns back) Well, well, well! My little pal, Gallagher,  a girl, huh? (unexpectedly, he bends to kiss her  hand) (tenderly) That's just to give you an idea that  I know how to treat a gal. Get fresh  with me and I'll sock you in that little  nose of yours. Excuse me. I'll be right  back. He exits. Gallagher is left staring  at her hand wonderingly. INT. SCHUYLER ENTRANCE HALL 162. MED. SHOT Bingy gets up from his throne chair,  and crosses into the doorway of the  library opposite him. He stops by a  carved low-boy, and curiously examines  a large antique vase. Stew comes in  and stops with a smile as he sees him. Bingy, his hand on the vase, looks up.  Stew walks over to him. STEW (referring to vase) What's the matter, Bingy, a little clumsy  to get in your pocket? Bingy sets down the vase and surveys  him. BINGY No. I was just looking at it. Pretty,  ain't it? I was just looking for the  price tag. INT. SCHUYLER LIBRARY 163. CLOSER SHOT OF THE TWO Bingy looks him up and down in silent,  insolent scrutiny. Stew begins to burn. STEW What do you want? BINGY Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted  to see how the old newshound looked  made up for a gentleman. STEW (sore) Would you like to have me turn around  for you, Bingy? BINGY Oh boy, I'd love it. ? 67 ? Stew makes a complete turn and faces  Bingy again. STEW How's that? BINGY (appraisingly) Not bad - not good - but not bad. You  ought to be able to fool about almost  anybody. STEW Is that so? Well, have you seen enough  - or would you like a photograph? BINGY A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't  mama had you done in oils yet? (singing) \"Just A Gigolo . . . \"[15] STEW Now get this mug. You've got the kind  of chin I just love to touch. And if  you don't get out of here, I'm going  to hang one right on it. Bingy assumes a conciliatory attitude. BINGY Take it easy! Take it easy, Dempsey.[16]  Just relax, my boy, relax and open your  pores. 164. CLOSER TWO SHOT Stew glares at him. Bingy goes on. BINGY I bring a message from Garcia. STEW Yeah? BINGY Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer  you a job. He wants you to write a daily  column on the Tribune. STEW (skeptically) Yeah - go on. BINGY It's all right. You can write your own  ticket. A hundred and fifty bucks a  week. STEW (thinks a bit - quietly) I'll bite. What's the catch? BINGY There's no catch. This is on the up  and up. Of course all you have to do  is just sign the article - by Anne Schuyler's  Husband. ? 68 ? 165. MED. SHOT Taking in the doorway. The butler starts  to pass by. Stew's eyes are blazing. BINGY Well, how does the old Cinderella man  feel about that? With a quick motion, Stew clips Bingy  on the jaw. Bingy, caught unawares,  reels backward. 166. CLOSER SHOT IN DOORWAY Bingy describes a backward arc, just  as Smythe, the butler, seeing he can  be of service, steps forward and catches  him. SMYTHE Well done, sir. Very neat. STEW (through his teeth) That's what I think of it, Bingy! Bingy sags in the butler's arms. The  butler looks at Stew inquiringly. Stew  nods. STEW (to butler) Smythe, the - er - gentleman is leaving. SMYTHE Yes, sir. Bingy is carried out. Stew stands glaring  after them. FADE OUT: FADE IN INT. SCHUYLER HOME 167. MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT Anne and her mother at the breakfast  table. ANNE Good morning, Mother. Didn't I tell  you that he'd be marvelous. Everybody  thought he was so charming last night. MRS. SCHUYLER I was so worried for fear he'd knock  over a vase or something. I must have  acted like an idiot. (notices the morning paper in Anne's  hands) What does it say about the reception  last night? ANNE Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah  attended the blah, blah reception and  wore the same blah, blah things. MRS. SCHUYLER (reproachfully) Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like  the person you're married to. ANNE You don't have anything to complain  about, Mother. He was all right last  night, wasn't he? I told you not to  worry about him. ? 69 ? MRS. SCHUYLER It was a miracle. The man was ill or  something. She suddenly notices front page of paper  Anne is reading. Her face freezes in  horror. She screams. MRS. SCHUYLER (screaming) Ah-ah-ah! ANNE Mother! MRS. SCHUYLER (frantically gesturing at paper) Look! Look! The front page! Anne turns paper and reads the article. CUT TO: INSERT: NEWSPAPER CINDERELLA MAN GROWS HAIR ON CHEST ATTACKS REPORTER IN SCHUYLER HOME. \"I wear the pants,\" says Anne Schuyler's  husband. \"It's Okay with me,\" says Anne. 168. MEDIUM SHOT Mrs. Schuyler gets up. Paces wildly  about room. In a frenzy. MRS. SCHUYLER I knew it! I knew it! I felt it in my  bones! She is interrupted by the entrance of  Grayson, who dashes into the room, his  eyes ablaze. In his hand he has a copy  of the morning paper. GRAYSON (tapping paper in hand) Did you see the papers? \"Cinderella  Man Grows Hair On Chest!\" This is the  most terrible kind of publicity that  could possibly MRS. SCHUYLER (interrupting) Don't you think I know it, Grayson? (as Smythe the butler enters with tray) Smith - send for Mr. Smythe! Er - Smythe,  send for Mr. Smith! SMYTHE (as he turns to go) Double-strength! MRS. SCHUYLER (muttering, as she exits scene) \"Cinderella Man Grows Hair On Chest!\" GRAYSON (close behind, contemptuously) \"I wear the pants,\" says Anne Schuyler's  husband! ? 70 ? INT. SCHUYLER ENTRANCE HALL - DAY 169. MEDIUM SHOT Stew, now dressed in a business suit,  comes from the direction of the stairs  and stops just before he gets to the  door of the drawing room. From within  there is an ominous silence. Stew looks  longingly in the direction of the front  door - then back at the drawing room,  squares his shoulders and goes in. INT. SCHUYLER DRAWING ROOM 170. CLOSE SHOT As Stew stops just inside the doorway.  He had been prepared for this, but it  strikes terror into his soul, just the  same. 171. MEDIUM FULL SHOT From his angle in the doorway. The jury  - Dexter Grayson, hands behind his back  - is standing, gazing at Stew with a  fishy eye. Mrs. Schuyler stares haughtily.  Anne is crying softly. CONTINUATION SCENE 170 Stew - looking around at the gallery  of faces. Then he forces a jaunty smile  to his face as he starts to enter, whistling  as he goes. STEW Good morning, everybody (he gets a cold, frigid, silent reception) Well, maybe it isn't a good morning,  huh? (to Anne) Anne, did you ever get the feeling that  there was someone else in the room with  you? 172. MEDIUM SHOT MRS. SCHUYLER Have you seen this? (shows him newspaper) STEW Yes - the worm! MRS. SCHUYLER I beg your pardon? STEW He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on  him! MRS. SCHUYLER To engage in a brawl! A cheap, common  brawl, in my own home! \"I wear the pants!\"  The pants ! Not even the trousers! GRAYSON I've tried to stop the evening papers,  but it's useless. 173. CLOSER SHOT - STEW AND GRAYSON STEW You quit trying to stop anybody GRAYSON Well, at best you might deny it. ? 71 ? STEW Why deny it? The more you deny, the  more they print. Let them alone! The  thing to do is to sit still and keep  our traps shut. GRAYSON Traps shut! STEW Certainly! I'll take care of this guy  Bingy myself, personally. (sees Anne crying) Now what are you crying about? 174. MEDIUM SHOT ANNE Is this true, Stewart? Did you really  say it? STEW Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't  say it for publication, however. MRS. SCHUYLER And you struck him right here in our  house? STEW Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here  in your house. And I'll strike anybody  in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella  Man. GRAYSON Well, what else do you expect them to  call you? ANNE Dexter. 175. CLOSEUP - STEW STEW (burning) That's the fourteenth crack you've made  to me. I'm keeping count. When you get  to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right  on the nose. As a matter of fact, I  ought to sock you right now. 176. MEDIUM FULL SHOT MRS. SCHUYLER Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit  there and watch this man insult us?  Haven't you any decency left? ANNE (defending him) Why doesn't Dexter show some decency?  And you might show some too, Mother.  What do you expect a man to do when  he's called such names? (to Stew) I'm glad you hit that reporter, Stewart.  He deserved it. ? 72 ? MRS. SCHUYLER (rising) All right, all right! It's your funeral,  Anne Schuyler! She flounces out. Grayson remains behind. STEW (to Grayson) Go on, beat it, shadow. Grayson turns to go, then braves the  last word. GRAYSON Cinderella Man! That's fifteen. He leaves in a huff. Stew puts his arms  around the crying Anne. FADE OUT: FADE IN INT. SCHUYLER DRAWING ROOM 177. FULL SHOT Six or eight people of distinction scattered  around the room. All dressed in full  evening clothes. Among them is Grayson,  Anne, her mother, and one man in aviator's  uniform. The men have their coats and  hats in their hands, the women have  their evening wraps on. Apparently they  are ready to leave for someplace and  are being detained. An indistinct murmur  of ad-lib conversation is heard. 178. CLOSE SHOT On Smythe, the butler, as he approaches  Mrs. Schuyler. SMYTHE Pardon me, madam. They phoned through  from the Mayor's committee to remind  you it's past the hour for the reception. MRS. SCHUYLER Are the cars ready? SMYTHE They've been ready for the last half  hour. 179. MED. CLOSE SHOT - GROUP Including Captain White, a young, handsome  aviator. AVIATOR (modestly) I hope I don't have to make any speeches  tonight, Anne. ANNE Oh, you can't disappoint all the women.  After all it isn't every day they get  to see a famous round-the-world flier. AVIATOR Yes, I know, but they scare me to death.  This is the fourth dinner you've taken  me to this week. I'm running out of  material. ANNE Are you complaining? ? 73 ? AVIATOR Yes, there are always too many other  people around. LADY Anne, it's getting late. What are we  waiting for? ANNE We're waiting for my husband (lightly, concealing her irritation) If you'll excuse me, I'll run up and  see what the slowpoke's doing. (to aviator) I'll be right back She starts out, climbing stairs to Stew's  room. INT. STEW'S BEDROOM 180. MEDIUM SHOT Stew stands in front of a mirror, fumbling  with his dress tie. He pauses, his hands  still on his tie. ANNE (reproachfully) Stewart! We're all waiting for you.  Where's your valet? STEW I poisoned him. ANNE Stop trying to be funny, and get ready,  will you? As he struggles with his collar, it  springs off. STEW I'm not going! ANNE What are you talking about? STEW I'm talking about - I'm not going out. 181. CLOSEUP - ANNE ANNE (controlling her anger) What am I going downstairs and tell  those people? STEW Go downstairs, and tell them - anything.  Tell them I'm not going. Tell them I'm  not home. ANNE (getting angrier by the minute) Stewart, would you mind telling me why  you're not going? ? 74 ? 182. CLOSEUP - STEW STEW Yes, I'll tell you - for the same reason  I've never wanted to go out with those  social parasites, those sweet-smelling  fashion plates. I don't like them. They  bore me. They give me the jitters. ANNE'S VOICE Do you know you're talking about my  friends? STEW Yes, I'm talking about your friends,  and they still give me the jitters. 183. DOUBLE SHOT ANNE Well, are you going - or aren't you? Stew makes a move to embrace her. STEW Anne, come here. Listen ANNE (sternly - slipping away from him) Look out for my lipstick, Stewart. STEW I'll tell you what. Let's you and me  sneak out all by ourselves ANNE (interrupting) Are you crazy? STEW Think of the fun we can have - we'll  sneak down the back stairs and get in  the valet's Ford. How's that? ANNE Will you stop being silly, Stewart? STEW (trying hard) I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take  you and introduce you to all my gang.  Would you like that? ANNE (hard) But I don't want to meet your gang. STEW I don't mean the newspaper fellows that  you don't like. Another gang I know  - you'd love them. They're writers and  musicians and artists - a great crowd  of people - people who do great things.  People who are worthwhile. ? 75 ? ANNE Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile,  I suppose? STEW Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I ANNE (interrupting belligerently) That's exactly what you mean. Heaven  knows you've made that clear to me often  enough. Well, I'm sick and tired of  it. I've given you party after party  - I've taken you to some of the best  houses in this town - and introduced  you to people of importance - and are  you grateful? No! You insult them and  act like a bore. I'm sick and tired  of having to make excuses for you and  the things that you've done. Perhaps  it's just as well you're not coming  tonight. Maybe I can enjoy myself for  once without having to worry about you,  and what you're going to do. With which violent declaration, she  flounces out of the room, leaving Stew  staring after her, angry and hurt. Impulsively,  he follows her to the door - a retort  on his lips. When he gets there, however,  she has vanished. He returns to the  room, wanders about thoughtfully, extracts  cigarette from box, fumbles it - walks  to window - stares out - turns back  to room - heaves a lonely sigh. He notices his reflection in the mirror,  and gestures toward it. STEW And that, my friends, is what is known  as the society belle telling ex-star-newspaper-reporter  to go to - how-have-you-been, Mr. Smith! 184. CLOSE SHOT As Stew sits in a typewriter chair.  He rolls up the sheet in the machine  so that he can read what is already  written. INSERT: TYPEWRITTEN SHEET, IN TYPEWRITER ACT 1 SCENE 1 AN HACIENDA IN MEXICO Strumming of guitars are dimly heard. BACK TO SCENE: He studies it for a moment, frowning  in dissatisfaction. He's stuck. He leans  back in the chair and looks up for inspiration. INSERT: A BIG CLOCK, TICKING AWAY THE  TIME. INT. SCHUYLER GRAND FOYER 185. LONG SHOT Of Stew Smith pacing the grand foyer.  Seen from overhead, he is dwarfed by  the surroundings. He tries hopscotching  on the pattern of the floor. That wears  thin quickly. Supremely bored, Stew  gives a shout and is rewarded with a  cavernous echo. Smythe the butler then  appears, nervously crouched behind some  grillwork. ? 76 ? 186. MEDIUM SHOT - STEW AND SMYTHE SMYTHE Did you call, sir? STEW Smythe, come here. I want to talk to  you. (Smythe looks unenthusiastic.) Come on, Smythe, talk to me. Smythe,  I'm going nuts. I'm going nuts in this  house! This big . . . come on, I'm not  going to hurt you. Come on, what's the  matter with you? Stew gives another shout and is rewarded  with another loud echo. This coaxes  Smythe out from behind the grillwork. STEW Shhh! Do you hear something? SMYTHE Yes, sir. STEW You try it. SMYTHE (reluctant) Me, sir? STEW Yeah. Smythe gives it a timid try. STEW No, no. Give it more volume. Smythe gives a more satisfactory yell.  Stew nods approval. Smythe begins yelling  and shouting in earnest. STEW No, that's enough. I just wanted you  to get the idea. Now you know. This  house is haunted. SMYTHE (incredulous) No, sir! STEW Yes. Have you looked in the closets  all over . . .? SMYTHE Yes, sir. STEW Found no skeletons? SMYTHE No, sir. STEW It's haunted just the same. ? 77 ? SMYTHE Yes, sir. Smythe has heard enough. He turns to  leave, but Stew grabs him. STEW Smythe, what do you do with yourself  - I mean, when you're not carrying those  double-strength - what do you do with  yourself? SMYTHE Well, sir, I putter. STEW Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and  want to amuse yourself, then what? SMYTHE I just putter. STEW Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to  have a putter to putter? SMYTHE Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands. STEW Well, isn't that nice? You just go right  ahead and putter with your hands. That's  all right. How do you do it? SMYTHE Well sir, I'll show you. He demonstrates, touching objects on  a table and blowing dust off a lampshade. SMYTHE That's puttering, sir. STEW No! Well, well, well! That's all right,  if you like it. Can anybody do that? SMYTHE Oh no, sir. Some people are natural  putterers. Others can never master it. STEW Oh my. You mean, some people are born  and never will become putterers? SMYTHE Yes sir. STEW Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know  that you could never be a putterer. SMYTHE Yes sir. ? 78 ? STEW How about me? Do you think if I concentrated  and put my whole soul into it, that  some day I might be a putterer? SMYTHE You sir? Uh-uh. You could never be a  putterer. Not a good putterer, sir. STEW Well, if I couldn't be a good putterer,  I wouldn't want to putter. But why?  What makes you think I couldn't be a  good putterer? SMYTHE Well sir, to be a putterer, one's mind  must be at ease. A person with a problem  could never be a putterer. For instance,  sir, a fish can putter in water but  not on land because he'd be out of place.  An eagle can putter around a rugged  mountaintop but not in a cage, because  he'd be restless and unhappy. Now sir,  if you will pardon me, with all due  respect, sir, as a Smythe to a Smith,  you are an eagle in a cage. STEW A bird in a gilded cage? SMYTHE Yes. STEW That's all I wanted to know! Stew rushes off upstairs. Smythe gives  the echo one last try. FADE OUT: INT. STEW'S ROOM 187. MEDIUM SHOT As Stew makes a telephone call. STEW Hello, Gallagher old pal. How are you,  old pal? INT. GALLAGHER'S ROOM - NIGHT 188. MEDIUM SHOT A simple room, probably in a boarding  house or cheap hotel. Gallagher is on  the phone. A typewriter stands nearby. GALLAGHER Oh, hello Stew. I'm pretty good, can't  complain. How's our gentleman of leisure? CONTINUATION SCENE 187 Stew at phone. STEW I'm on the coast of Norway and I can't  get out - will you come and get me out  of the coast of Norway? CONTINUATION SCENE 188 Gallagher at phone. ? 79 ? GALLAGHER Oh, your play. Hmmm, Act One, Scene  One: Coast of Norway - and then a lot  of blank. Is that it? CONTINUATION SCENE 187 Stew at phone. STEW Yeah. Come on, don't be silly. (pause) All right, if you feel like you need  a chaper-one, call up Hank. Yeah. You'll  find him at Joe's, no doubt. Yeah. Hank  would be my idea of a perfect bodyguard. (pause) Sure you would. I knew I could depend  on you, old pal. Snap it up, will you,  Gallagher? CONTINUATION SCENE 188 Gallagher at phone. GALLAGHER Okay. She hangs up, joyful at the prospect  of seeing Stew. She hums softly to herself  as she picks up the receiver again. INT. SCHUYLER ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT 189. MED. SHOT SOUND (bell ringing) Stew comes out of the library. Smythe  is going down the hall. Stew intercepts  him. STEW Smythe, I'll get this. I'm expecting  some friends. SMYTHE Very good, sir. 190. MED. CLOSE SHOT At entrance door. Stew enters and opens  it. Gallagher and Hank enter. STEW Well, Gallagher! Glad to see you. GALLAGHER Hello, Stew. STEW Hello, Hank. How are you? HANK Fine, but kinda thirsty. STEW Come right in - I'll get you a drink. HANK Okay - you remember Joe ? 80 ? STEW Sure. HANK I sort of invited him along to bend  an elbow. You don't mind, do you? STEW It's all right. Bring him in. Joe appears in the open doorway. Stew  sees him. HANK Come in, Joe. It's all right. STEW Hello, Joe. JOE Hello kid, how are you? Glad to see  you. Stew starts to close the door. JOE Just a minute - Johnson's outside. You  don't mind if he comes in and dips a  beak[17] do you? STEW No, no, bring him in. The more the merrier. JOE Come on in! Johnson appears in the open doorway.  Stew sees him. STEW Hello, Johnson. JOHNSON Hello, Stew, old pal. How are you? STEW Glad to see you. Come in, kid. Stew starts to close the door. JOHNSON Wait a minute. I got two of the boys  I brought along - they were cruising  around with nothing to do. You don't  mind if I bring them in? STEW You brought two of the boys? That's  all right. Bring them in. What's the  difference? The two enter, followed in a single  file by 12-14 men and women, all of  whom greet Stew as they enter, ad-libbing  hello's and hand-shakes. Stew stares  at them dumbfoundedly. 191. MEDIUM FULL SHOT They swarm into the hallway and overflow  into the rooms on either side. The butler  stands aghast at this invasion. Stew  starts to close the door when three  or four more troop in, shouting cheery  greetings. Stew regards them in amazement. ? 81 ? 192. CLOSER SHOT - STEW As he watches them file past. STEW I'm sorry nobody could come. HANK The rest of the gang had to get out  the morning edition - but they'll be  down later. STEW Now Hank, are you sure they're coming?  It will be lonesome without them. (to Smythe) Smythe, take this crowd in there and  give them a drink. And find out what  the boys in the back room want! Smythe gulps nervously, as he is dragged  off by the revellers. INT. SCHUYLER DRAWING ROOM 193. FULL SHOT The gang have taken seriously Stew's  suggestion that they make themselves  at home. They have draped themselves  about the place - a couple are strumming  on the piano and others are inspecting  the room in awe-struck attitudes. Smythe  is being propelled around the room by  the revellers. SMYTHE It isn't done, gentlemen! It isn't done,  I say! It isn't done! INT. SCHUYLER ENTRANCE HALL 194. MEDIUM SHOT - GALLAGHER AND STEW STEW Well, Gallagher, you certainly took  no chances, did you? GALLAGHER I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank  did the rest. STEW I see. Hank brought them all. That's  all right. We'll give them a drink and  throw 'em out. How's that? GALLAGHER Okay. STEW (as Smythe passes by, being propelled  by revellers) Smythe! Give them one drink and throw  'em out! SMYTHE (dazed) Yes, sir. ? 82 ? Bingy pokes his head in the door, wearing  a false beard. STEW (spotting him) Is there a green elephant standing beside  that bwana? BINGY No, it's just little Bingy Baker. Stew rolls up his sleeves, preparatory  to launching a punch. BINGY (warningly) Uh-uh. Bingy dons a pair of glasses, and points  to them meaningfully. He enters, cautiously,  watching Stew warily. BINGY (striking a pose) Big Chief Bingy come to white man's  tepee to make friends. Big Chief very  sorry. To show how sorry - will bend  over and let white man kick Big Chief  where sun never shines. STEW Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss  this one for the world. He bends over, and Stew winds up and  delivers a hard kick to his backside.  Bingy straightens stiffly, then removes  a bottle of alcohol from the target  area. BINGY Fire water all right. (he takes a drink) Both start laughing. BINGY Well, Stew, that's all thrashed out.  By golly, I'm surely glad to see that  you're not really sore. You know our  racket - after all, news is news. STEW Sure, sure. That's all right. That was  a great story, Bingy. A great story  - wish I'd printed it. BINGY I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That  hairy chest story! STEW (indicating Bingy's false beard) You've raised it up to the chin, I see. (laughs) Go on in the other room and get yourself  a drink. Bingy emits a war-whoop and proceeds  into the drawing room, where Smythe  is still being held hostage by the party. ? 83 ? 195. CLOSER SHOT Gallagher and Stew. STEW You know what I should do with you?  I should sock you right in that funny  little nose. GALLAGHER Yes - and I'd love it. SMYTHE Sure, you'd love it. He draws her out of the entrance hall,  and the CAMERA MOVES WITH THEM as they  head upstairs, the party around them  going in full force. INT. STEW'S SITTING ROOM 196. MEDIUM SHOT Stew and Gallagher enter. Apparently  they have been talking about Stew's  play on the way upstairs. GALLAGHER How far have you gotten? STEW Well, I've just been able to get off  that Norway coast - so far. Stew gestures toward the typewriter  from which a sheet of paper is protruding.  Gallagher crosses to it. She rolls up  the sheet so she can read what is typed  on it. GALLAGHER (reading) 'Act One - Scene One - A Street in Old  Madrid' She turns as Stew walks over to her. GALLAGHER (smiling) Well, you're not getting your play done,  but you're certainly covering a lot  of territory. STEW (grins) Haven't I covered some territory? It  feels like I've been on a Cook's Tour[18]  some place. 197. CLOSER TWO SHOT Stew, standing before her. GALLAGHER (seriously) Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid? STEW (grinning in spite of himself) Been where? Gallagher To Old Madrid. ? 84 ? STEW Never even been to New Madrid. GALLAGHER Then how do you expect to write about  it? STEW Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose. GALLAGHER Did Conrad draw on his imagination? Stew is brought up with a start. STEW Did who? GALLAGHER Conrad. STEW What do you know about Conrad? GALLAGHER I don't know a thing about him, but  isn't he the one you're always yelling  about? Stew is noticeably impressed with this  point of view. STEW Gosh, you look cute. Gallagher warms up to her subject. GALLAGHER Isn't he the one that always writes  about things - only the things he knows  about? STEW Right. GALLAGHER Didn't he go to sea before he wrote  about it? STEW Right. 198. MEDIUM SHOT GALLAGHER Then why don't you write about something  you know? Write about yourself and Anne.  The poor boy who marries a rich girl  - now there's a swell theme. STEW Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's  an idea there. I wonder now . . . GALLAGHER Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine  . . . ? 85 ? STEW (warming up - he puts arm around Gallagher's  shoulder) And there's her mother - and what a  character that old dame would make with  her double-strength - and that lawyer  friend of theirs - he'd make a great  villain - and there's you! GALLAGHER (smiling) What could I be? STEW You could be something. (inspiration striking, he dashes to  the typewriter) I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get  this set. That's a great idea for a  play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will  you? GALLAGHER Here you are. STEW All right, thanks. Now, let's see. How  will I start? Hey pal, how would you  start? LAP DISSOLVE TO: INT. SCHUYLER ENTRANCE HALL 199. MED. FULL SHOT Shooting through into the drawing room.  It is many hours later. The members  of the party, including Smythe, are  pretty well lit. On the floor of the  entrance hall a dice game is in progress.  In the drawing room four or five are  hanging over the piano singing \"The  Grasshopper Jumped Over Another Grasshopper's  Back.\" In general, a large time is being had.  As the scene opens a door-bell is ringing.  A key is heard in the lock. 200. CLOSER SHOT - GROUP - IN ENTRANCE  HALL The outer door starts to swing open.  One of the party guests, very wall-eyed  now, and carrying a whiskey bottle in  his hand, staggers toward the door.  It opens wider, and Anne and Mrs. Schuyler  and Dexter Grayson stand gasping in  the opening. The guest comes up to them. GUEST (starting to close door) Say, you can't come in here - this is  a private party. Anne pushes the door violently, which  sends the guest sprawling. He stays  where he lands, holding the bottle in  both arms across his chest. Anne and  her mother advance into a CLOSE SHOT  and look off with incredulous horror  and amazement. 201. MEDIUM SHOT On a drunk Bingy as he peers at them  from an alcove above. BINGY (recognizing Grayson) Hey, my old classmate from Harvard!  Whoopee! Harvard, '98! (spotting Mrs. Schuyler) Hello, mama! ? 86 ? 202. MEDIUM SHOT Most are too cock-eyed or too engrossed  in the ongoing crap game to notice them. DEXTER I know who's the cause of it all! ANNE Oh, Dexter! One of the men wanders in from the drawing  room in time to hear this conversation.  He assumes an attitude of exaggerated  courtesy and gallantry as he bows before  them. Anne and her mother are almost bursting  with fury. They spot Smythe, across  the room, thoroughly in his cups. MRS. SCHUYLER (to butler) Smythe! Smythe - who are these people? Smythe comes stumbling up, a grin plastered  on his face. SMYTHE (thoroughly plastered) Friends of mine. Very lit-lit-literary  people. GRAYSON (confidentially, to Mrs. Schuyler) He's drunk. MRS. SCHUYLER (aghast) Smythe, you've been drinking. SMYTHE (proudly) I have. Double-strength! GRAYSON (confidentially) Very drunk. MRS. SCHUYLER (indignant) Where is Mr. Smith? SMYTHE Well, for crying out loud, I don't know.  And I don't care. Whoopee! He jubilantly exits scene. GRAYSON (confidentially) Very, very drunk. INT. STEW'S SITTING ROOM 203. MEDIUM SHOT Stew gets to his feet as an idea strikes  him. STEW Now Gallagher, if we could only get  a great scene - a tremendously emotional  scene - some- ? 87 ? thing that would just wring the hearts  out of the public - to bring the curtain  down in the second act - that would  be okay. Couldn't dig one out of your  hat some place, could you? GALLAGHER Nope - afraid I'm all out of tricks  tonight. STEW Now, we've got it right up to where  the boy's wearing his white spats and  going to teas and the frau enters -  how's that? GALLAGHER Very good. 204. MED. CLOSE SHOT At the partially opened door into the  hall. It opens wider, and Anne looks  in. She stares in horrified amazement. 205. MEDIUM SHOT (FROM HER ANGLE) Gallagher, her shoes off, sprawled out  on the chaise longue, stretches luxuriously  and yawns. CAMERA PANS TO Stew at the  typewriter, hair mussed, coffee pot  and cups prominent, the dressing gown  over the back of his chair. Neither  of them has seen Anne. CONTINUATION SCENE 204 Anne. She gasps as she quietly steps  further into the room. 206. CLOSE SHOT - GALLAGHER Gallagher, caught in the midst of a  grand stretch, sits up abruptly, startled.  She stares uncomfortably off at Anne. 207. CLOSE SHOT - STEW At the typewriter. He glances up momentarily  and very absently, and goes right on  typing. STEW (absently) Oh hello, Anne He types furiously. ANNE (tight-lipped) Good morning. What does this mean? Stewart looks up surprised at the tone  of her voice. STEW What does what mean? 208. MEDIUM SHOT - THE THREE Gallagher, sensing scene, starts hastily  looking for her shoes. One of them has  been shoved under the chaise longue  and she has to get down on her hands  and knees to retrieve it. Anne comes  in and confronts them, her hands on  her hips. STEW Oh, that mob downstairs. I guess I got  so interested in the play I forgot all  about them. ANNE I see. ? 88 ? STEW Have we got a play, Anne? Oh, have we  got a play! Of course most of it is  Gallagher's. She did most of it. That  brain of hers just snaps like that all  the time. He indicates by snapping his fingers.  Gallagher quietly gathers up her things,  apprehensive of the storm about to break. ANNE (coldly) I'm not interested in the way her brain  snaps. Stew stares at Anne as Gallagher, her  hat in her hand, her coat over her arm,  starts for the door. GALLAGHER I think I better go, Stew. ANNE I think you should, Miss Gallagher. STEW Wait a minute, Gallagher. Gallagher stops, transfixed by the new  tone in his voice. He comes over to  Anne. 209. CLOSE TWO SHOT - ANNE AND STEW STEW What's the idea, Anne? ANNE The idea is simply this - that I want  those people to leave here immediately. STEW Now wait a minute. Aren't you being  a little unreasonable? ANNE Unreasonable! Have you any idea what  the place looks like downstairs? Do  you expect me to stand here and see  this place turned into a cheap barroom? STEW Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's  no reason for that. Perhaps the boys  have had a little too much to drink.  That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go  right down and throw them out. That's  no reason for you to take this attitude.  After all, I certainly have a right  to invite a few of my friends to my  house, haven't I? ANNE (pointedly) Your house? STEW (getting the implication; after a pause) O-o-oh, I get you ? 89 ? (a knowing chuckle) All right. All right. I don't blame  you. I kinda forgot myself for a moment,  there. That's what I call getting me  told, isn't it, Anne? Anne remains silent. That's exactly  what she has done. STEW I suppose I've been boarding out this  past year. 210. MEDIUM SHOT He takes his coat off back of chair  and slips into it. STEW (quietly; grimly) All right, I'll tell you thisI don't  like your boarding house, lady As he gathers up loose manuscript, he  continues . . . STEW and if it's all the same to you, I'm  moving out. ANNE Stewart! STEW (hotly) This is something I should have done  a long time ago, only I didn't have  sense enough to do it. No, I had to  stick around here to try and make a  success of something that I knew darn  well was a failure from the very beginning.  But no more. No more! So that's that. ANNE You can't walk out of here like this. Throughout the scene, Stew is gathering  his things togetherand probably packing  an overnight bag. STEW Oh I can't? Who's going to stop me?  I'd like to see somebody stop me. If  you think I'm going to stick around  this joint just to look at this mausoleum,  not on your life! You're going to make  no stuffed shirt out of me. Now what  do you think of that? Mrs. Schuyler stalks majestically in. MRS. SCHUYLER What's going on here? Who is this woman? STEW (snappily) Joan of Arc! What's it to you? MRS. SCHUYLER Heavens! The man's insane! ? 90 ? 211. CLOSEUP - STEW STEW Sure I'm insane, but I've got some good  news for you. (points to himself) This magnolia is leaving your sweet  smelling vanilla joint. This bird in  a cage is gonna button his own pants  from now on. And that is what is known  as telling the mother-in-law. Gallagher's cry of joy is cut off by  an icy look from Mrs. Schuyler. GALLAGHER Eurek! 212. MEDIUM SHOT Stew is stuffing things into a bag. STEW (heatedly to Anne) You've done nothing but watch me - watch  me! - ever since I've been here. Treated  me like a thug, watched me like a hawk,  mistrusted me. Every time I leave the  house, that Jane (indicating Mrs. Schuyler) goes out and counts the silverware. ANNE That's ridiculous. STEW Fine! I don't blame her. I know I'm  out of my own crowd. I should have had  better sense in the beginning. But I'll  stay in my own backyard from now on. ANNE You're acting like a child. STEW All right, I'm a child. Have it any  way you want. But I'm going back to  my own apartment, where I should have  lived in the first place. But no, I  got to listen to you and move here.  All right. If you want to live with  me, Anne, okay. But the sign outside  will say \"Mr. Stew Smith\" and you'll  have to be \"Mrs. Stew Smith\" or there's  nothing doing. No more Anne Schuyler's  husband He has his bag all packed by this time.  He snaps it shut viciously, lifts it  off the chair, picks up his hat, and  notices Mrs. Schuyler staring open-mouthed  at him. STEW (to Mrs. Schuyler, pointedly) and here's some more news for you.  You can take your red room, your green  room, your left wing and your right  wing, and you know what you can do with  them! ? 91 ? (to Gallagher) Come on, Gallagher. He brushes by Mrs. Schuyler and Anne,  exiting. ANNE (exasperated) Oh, Stewart! EXT. SCHUYLER HOME - NIGHT 213. MEDIUM SHOT Stew and Gallagher appear, coming through  the iron gates. 214. MEDIUM MOVING SHOT As Stew and Gallagher move off down  the street, a ragged old panhandler  comes wheedling up to them. PANHANDLER Pardon me, could you spare a dime for  a cup of coffee? Stew is struck by a sudden idea as he  regards the bum intently. STEW Coffee? How would you like to be a Knight  of the Garter? PANHANDLER (stupidly) Huh! No Stew raises one foot, then the other,  and quickly removes the solid gold garters  which he presses into the bum's surprised  hand. STEW (as he removes the garters) Just a minute. (to Gallagher) Entertain the gentleman, Gallagher. (to the panhandler) There you are, my man - with those you  can eat for a couple of months. He walks away, leaving the bum staring  dazedly at the luxurious pair of garters. PANHANDLER (an afterthought) How about the socks? 215. MED. CLOSE SHOT As Stew and Gallagher pass the Camera  and go down the street, arm in arm.  As they get past the Camera, Stew is  seen to square his shoulders and throw  out his chest. He shakes first one leg,  and then the other, as if he were throwing  off shackles. 216. CLOSER MOVING SHOT Stew and Gallagher moving along. Gallagher  has a peculiar expression as she glances  at Stew. She has been deeply affected  by the scene she has just witnessed.  Stew's face is very thoughtful. GALLAGHER (comfortingly) I wouldn't worry too much about it,  Stew. She'll see it your way. ? 92 ? STEW Huh? (snapping out of it) Oh, I'm not worrying about her - I'm  worrying about that second act curtain,  that's all. Gallagher stares at him, realizing he  is thinking more about the play than  his split-up with his wife. Then she  breaks into a grin. GALLAGHER Why, you're just a first-class chump!  You just staged a scene that would play  like a million dollars! How about that  declaration of independence for the  second act curtain? Stew stops stock still and stares at  her. STEW (almost reverently) That's an idea, Gallagher - a great  idea. Gallagher happily links her arm in his  and again they move down the street. FADE OUT: FADE IN INSERT: CLOSE SHOT OF NAME PLATE OVER  DOORBELL \"STEWART SMITH\" LAP DISSOLVE TO: INSERT: SHEET IN TYPEWRITER On it is being typed: Act 3. Scene 1. LAP DISSOLVE TO: 217. INT. STEW'S APARTMENT - DAY - MED.  FULL SHOT Inexpensive but comfortable. Stew is  in his shirtsleeves. A battered old  typewriter stands on the table with  a sheet of blank paper in it. Stew is  seated in a chair before it, and is  picking out the letters, typing. He  pauses, running up the roller to regard  what he has written. 218. INT. STEW'S KITCHENETTE - MED.  SHOT Gallagher, in a little apron, is frying  some ham and eggs. She looks up as she  sees Stew from the doorway. STEW Hey, Gallagher! GALLAGHER Yeah? STEW How about my breakfast? How do you expect  me to ring a curtain down on an empty  stomach? GALLAGHER It'll be ready in a minute. ? 93 ? STEW (accusingly) Never mind that. If you can't get my  breakfast ready - and can't get here  on time in the morning - then you can  go get yourself another job. GALLAGHER (in mock contrition) Sorry, boss STEW Don't be sorry. Just get the breakfast,  that's all. 219. INT. STEW'S LIVING ROOM - MED.  SHOT There is a knock on the hall door. Stew crosses and opens it. 220. CLOSER SHOT As Stew opens the door. It reveals Dexter  Grayson in the little hallway, immaculately  clad, as usual. Stew regards him in  frank surprise for a moment. GRAYSON Hello, Smith. STEW (puzzled) Holy jumping swordfish! GRAYSON I suppose you know why I came? STEW No, I have no idea - unless some of  the silver-ware is missing. GRAYSON Now don't be absurd, Smith (as he brushes past, walking inside) May I come in? STEW Surely, come right in. GRAYSON (as he sits down) Thanks. May I sit down? STEW Surely, sit down. If I had known you  were coming, I would have thrown you  up a waffle. GRAYSON I don't eat waffles. STEW You don't. 221. MED. SHOT Grayson sits stiffly on one of the Grand  Rapids chairs. Stew remains standing,  and waits silently for Grayson to speak.  Grayson clears his throat. ? 94 ? GRAYSON Anne asked me to come and see you about  the divorce. STEW (with enlightened expression) She did? GRAYSON (uncomfortably) She wants me to arrange the financial  settlement. STEW Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and  75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have  any part of that she wants, but she'd  better hurry because I'm spending it  awfully fast. GRAYSON (interrupting) You don't seem to understand. Anne doesn't  expect anything from you. 222. INT. STEW'S KITCHENETTE - MED.  SHOT Gallagher. Overcome by curiosity at  the sound of voices, she leaves the  frying eggs and goes quietly to the  doorway and peeks out. 223. MED. SHOT Grayson and Stew. GRAYSON We should like to know how much you  would want to Stew stares off incredulously. STEW (interrupting) Wait a minute. Do I get from you that  she wants to pay me alimony? GRAYSON That's putting it crudely, but Stew starts advancing nervously toward  him. Grayson, a bit alarmed, rises. STEW (closing in on him) Remember what I told you about that  twentieth crack? All right, you've just  made it. Before you go unconscious I  want you to get this through your nut. GRAYSON I beg your pardon. STEW Unconscious. You know, when you don't  know anything. Your natural state. There  are some people - you can't buy their  self-respect for a bucket of shekels  - well, I happen to be one of those  guys. ? 95 ? 224. CLOSE SHOT Showing kitchen door open a crack. Gallagher's  eyes are glistening as she watches and  listens. 225. MED. CLOSE SHOT Stew and Grayson. GRAYSON (weakly) We just thought that STEW (snaps) Don't think. Let me do all the thinking.  Now you go back to that Schuyler outfit  and tell them that I didn't marry that  dame for her dough and I don't want  any of her dough now. I was too poor  to buy her a wedding present when we  got married, so I'm giving her a divorce  for a wedding present. Now, stand up! Grayson does so, completely intimidated  by Stew's manner. Stew grabs him by  the lapel. GRAYSON Yes. STEW And now for that twentieth crack Stew punches Grayson on chin and knocks  him through the open door into the hall. He slams door shut. 226. WIDER SHOT Stew thrusts his hands into his pockets  and walks thoughtfully back to the typewriter. 227. CLOSER SHOT Stew standing staring down at the typewriter.  He is still flushed with anger. Suddenly  a thought strikes him, and his face  breaks into a broad grin. He sits down  quickly, and begins pounding away. 228. MED. SHOT Gallagher enters from the kitchen, carrying  a platter of ham and eggs and a coffee  pot. She sets them on a small table  and this is spread with a cloth. Then  she crosses over to Stew. GALLAGHER (pretending ignorance) Who was that? STEW (without looking up from his typing) Grayson - Anne's lawyer. GALLAGHER What did he want? STEW Gallagher, that guy just dropped by  to give us a great opening for the third  act. They sit at the little table. ? 96 ? 229. CLOSER SHOT GALLAGHER What was the idea he gave you? Stew dives into the ham and eggs. STEW It's a swell idea, Gallagher. How's  this? The wife's family lawyer comes  to see the kid, see - to talk over the  divorce. Then this guy insults the poor  but honest boy by offering him alimony  - so the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer  in the nose and throws him out. How's  that for the beginning of the third  act, huh? GALLAGHER Well, from now on the play will be easy.  All you have to do is bring the wife  back, have her say she's sorry, and  then your play's over. 230. CLOSEUP - STEW He looks over at Gallagher with a peculiar  expression. STEW (vehemently - as he scoops out some  melon) What's the matter? Do you think I'm  going to let that guy go back to his  wife? Not on your life. He's got to  go to the other girl. 231. CLOSEUP - GALLAGHER She almost drops her coffee cup in a  wild gleam of hope as she looks back  at him. Gallagher tries hard to keep  her voice steady. GALLAGHER (not sure of herself) What other girl? 232. MED. CLOSE SHOT OF THE TWO STEW The little O'Brien girl, of course -  the one you suggested in the story. GALLAGHER (ecstatic, but still fighting) But that's ridiculous! You can't make  a sudden change like that. STEW Gallagher, what are you going to do  - tell me how to write a play? GALLAGHER No. STEW There's nothing sudden about that (tensely) He's always loved the girl, but he was  such a sap he didn't have sense enough  to tell her. Well, that's all right  - we can fix that. He will ? 97 ? go to the little O'Brien girl, and -  here, I'll show you. He gets to his feet, and comes around  to her. 233. CLOSE TWO SHOT Gallagher watches him a bit uncertainly. STEW (tenderly) He goes to the little O'Brien gal and  he says to her - in some pretty words  of some kind - something that you can  write - he'll say (as if reading part - very emotional) Darling, I'm sorry. I've been a fool  all my life. I've always loved you,  only I didn't have sense enough to see  it. As quick as I can get a divorce  from my wife, I want you to marry me.  Then she'll look at him that way - yeah  - then they'll embrace, or something  like that. (they draw closer) Then he'll kiss her, or something. To demonstrate the point, Stew takes  her in his arms and kisses her. They  hold the kiss longer than is justified.  Stew is swept away by his sudden emotion  and clings to her desperately, while  Gallagher's arms instinctively go around  his neck. Gallagher chokes back tears that persist  in coming. She stifles a sob. Stew folds  her in his arms. STEW (tenderly) What's the matter, Gallagher? What's  the matter? Gallagher buries her face in his shoulders. FADE OUT. THE END"
