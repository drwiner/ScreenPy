Nathan nods to his pretty French assistant, Gabrielle, wh presses a button. The Lucite domes over the salads lift. Tentatively both mice reach for a fork. There is a tiny p of velcro on each mouse's paw and a tiny piece of velcro each of the forks. The first mouse picks the correct fork and stabs it into the salad and eats happily, relieved. T second mouse picks the wrong fork. Nathan presses a butto which sends the mouse flying off his chair with an electr shock. The correct mouse keeps eating, unconcerned.
