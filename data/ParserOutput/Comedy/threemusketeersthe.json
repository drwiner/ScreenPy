And last, anti-pastoral, out of place -- the sound of CLASHING STEEL. SUPERIMPOSE:   France, 1625. Suddenly, two young men burst INTO VIEW, sword points cutting brilliant arcs through the morning air. The first is GIRARD, bearded, nearly thirty, a man in every facet. The second, D'ARTAGNAN. Younger in appearance and attitude. Exuberant, handsome. And at just this moment, bounding over a low stone wall with a boisterous cry. They battle across an expanse of turf thick with dew. Girard is the more polished combatant. But d'Artagnan is nearly a force of nature. He whips his sword through the air with wild-hearted abandon. He tumbles and somer- saults. This is fun. Girard and d'Artagnan cross the field, pass over a wooden fence, struggle toward a stable and hayloft. As they fight, both men utilize a variety of props. Handfuls of hay, a wooden spar, quick kicks from heavy boots. Anything goes as the swords cut through the air. D'Artagnan, gaining increasing advantage, forces Girard up against a peaceful country manor. Girard, seemingly cornered, executes a gymnastic flip onto the roof, fights from this high angle. D'Artagnan merely smiles... and follows."

But d'Artagnan parries the blow with a heavy gloved hand, rolls over the offending goose -- glances deadpan apology -- and rises to fight again. The epic battle continues. Girard's modest success de- volves into desperate flight. D'Artagnan's seemingly endless reserves are wearing him down. Then, at the last possible moment, Girard spies escape: a slow- moving HAYCART RUIMBLING up the country road. He runs toward the cart, leaps upon it, turns back to d'Artagnan with a confident smirk -- an expression that vanishes when the young Gascon executes a nearly impossible leap to join him. And still they battle, the clash of swords a kind of music by now, the men, their exuberance, the bright morn- ing all combined into a dazzlingly heroic display. Just then: The haycart crosses a wooden plank bridge. Girard backs from d'Artagnan's sword, weak from exhaustion, he stumbles. D'Artagnan has his man and he knows it. He prepares one last blow -- -- And the haycart shifts, deposits both men over the side and down to the small muddy creek below. A comical antidote to all this glorious swordplay."

Athos is a brutal swords- man, his strokes overpowering and savage. His repertoire also includes swift kicks, solid punches, the occasional elbow when necessary. Aramis is a seamless and graceful technician, he handles his two opponents with balletic ease, an artist working with steel and flesh, rather than paint and canvas. And last, and perhaps the most entertaining of all, Porthos. He is a walking arsenal, carrying a variety of bizarre weapons on his body -- a crossbow, daggers, bolo, nunchucks -- all of which he uses with the polished skill of a master. Add this funhouse of armaments to his already impressive size and strength, and you have a one- man wrecking crew of epic proportions. D'Artagnan's youthful energy is by now familiar. He bounds about like a newborn tiger, encircles his adver- sary, changing stance and shifting his ground with alac- rity. Jussac is having a hard time defending himself against his opponent who seems to be attacking from all directions at once."

Four passengers wait to be carried across -- TWO GENTLEMAN CAVALIERS on horseback, and a country WOMAN and her child. As the flatboat enters its slip, the two Cavaliers urge their horses on board, rudely jostling the Woman and her child to the rear. The Ferryman, an experienced boot-licker, bows and scrapes to the Cavaliers, collects the coins they toss to his way."

Athos' horse is struck by a bullet, stag- gers forward... and collapses just as they reach the crest. D'Artagnan leaps off his horse, takes cover with Athos behind the boulders. Athos takes aim, FIRES a SHOT, and kills one of the horsemen below. The others curse, leap from their mounts, seek cover. SHOTS WHIZ back and forth like angry hornets. Stalemate, but not for long. They are badly outnumbered. The horsemen creep slowly up the hillside, from tree to tree. Athos turns to d'Artagnan as he reloads:"

Followed by Armand de Winter, Aramis, d'Artagnan. And Athos. He watches every step. The procession stops at the cliff's edge. THUNDER RUMBLES. Lightning slashes the sky. The Executioner ties Milady's hands behind her. The Executioner removes a bright scimitar from beneath his cloak. Milady catches Athos' eye. He holds her gaze. He stares at Milady unflinchingly, as if to burn her image into his eyes, so that he might keep it there until the day he dies. Aramis reaches inside his cloak, removes the sacred priestly cloth he carries."
