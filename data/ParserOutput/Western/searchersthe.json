As we shall find out soon, he has a br and buxom wife and a rather astonishing brood of children BRAD JORGENSEN is one of these: sandy-haired, brash, amia impulsive. He is in his early twenties. CHARLIE MacCORRY, slightly older than Brad, is Sergeant o Company A of the Rangers. (He is also Company A.) Charlie a taciturn, gently-spoken, competent man, clearly pattern by his association with Captain, the Rev. Sam. MOSE HARPER is an old scout -- a walking bone-rack, yet  capable of tireless feats of endurance. Some think him  \"tetched\" yet he has managed to endure to his age during time and in a region where few men lived to see their  grandchildren. He wears a ragged dark overcoat in all wea a narrow-brimmed hat with a feather in its band. ED NESBY is a rancher and homesteader in his mid-thirties resolute, honest, self-effacing; nothing picturesque or  dramatic about him; just a solid citizen and a realist."
