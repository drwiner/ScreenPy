Army Engineers with their tripod-mounted scopes and binoculars are shoulder to shoulder with the armed infantry.  Everyone stares off at the same point on the horizon.  Waiting. The VIDEO CAMERA movements are HANDHELD, unsteady, as it moves through the line of Army personnel to reveal a second, less organized semicircle of observers fifty yard behind the Army.  LOCALS from nearby towns perch in truck beds and on car roofs, Budweiser and Fritos at hand, eyes glued to the distant object. The VIDEO CAMERA image climbs up onto the roof of a parke local TV van, finds the object again in the distance, zooms in, and waits, like everyone else. Abruptly the VIDEO IMAGE contracts, becoming a box CHROMAKEYED behind CNN reporter DUNCAN CRAIS."

His feet are just clear of the surface when -- Harcourt's han and arm rocket out of the water, grabbing Sykes' ankle. Sykes looks down in horror.  The helicopter keeps moving up, and before Harcourt's body breaks the surface, the ar tears away from the torso at the shoulder.  Sykes wildly shakes the clinging severed arm from his ankle, and it falls back into the water below. Jetson continues pulling him up into the helicopter as it moves off toward shore."
