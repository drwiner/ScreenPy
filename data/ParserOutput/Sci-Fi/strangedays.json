Snapping a look down-- Walls rushing past, sound of wind, and our own raspy scream-- Ground rushing up-- Split second impression of a cat, looking up, yowling and running out of the way as-- Pavement fills frame.

She is in her early twenties, and the harshness of her life has just begun to harden her features.  She looks lost and without hope, in fear of her life.  Her breath comes in hitching sobs, and her eyes are wild. She runs between cold steel walls of freight cars, lookin behind her frequently.  A police helicopter is circling. Its xenon beam plays over the train yard, sweeping over the cars.  She hunches into the shadows of a freight-car as the beam passes over.  Looking under the cars she sees an LAPD patrol car cruising down a street adjoining the yard, its searchlight sweeping toward her.  It moves on. She continues her run, moving away from the direction of the patrol car.  She reaches a chain-link fence.  Crying, she scrambles over it, cutting her hands and ripping her dress.  Another patrol car passes two blocks away.  She crouches in the tall grass until it rounds a corner out o sight."

All she cares about are the police lights, an the sound of the helicopter droning, circling. She pauses at the mouth of the alley, scanning the well- lit street beyond.  There are people here: downtown low- life street people.  A half-block away is a brightly lit sign marking the entrance to a Red-Line subway station. She walks along the sidewalk, her eyes on the sign, feeling exposed as she walks openly, her heart pounding. She is a mess, but in this section of town people barely glance at her. LOW ANGLE on her bare feet, standing out amid the shoes and boots of winter. SHE CROSSES the street, and reaches the sidewalk just as black-and-white rounds the corner at the end of the block behind her. IN THE CRUISER are TWO COPS, who are scanning the street. They look intense.  Revved up.  They are BURDEN SPREG, a massive, barrel-chested street-lifer in his mid-forties, and DWAYNE ENGELMAN, an aggressive hard-on in his twentie with a brush cut, a Nautilus body, and a face like a ferret."

OUTSIDE, Spreg is running next to the accelerating train. He swings his pistol, smashing the window with the butt. Iris screams as Spreg lunges through the opening next to her like some uniformed nightmare and grabs her.  He is still running alongside, pulling on her.  Trying to drag her right out through the window. She struggles.  Bites his beefy hand.  He swears and lets go.  Then makes one last grab.  Gets his fingers into her long mane of hair.  Yanks on her.  She comes half out the window, screaming. Then... RIP!  The hair pulls off her head. Spreg drops away, behind the speeding train, holding a red wig.  He looks at it stupidly, then raises his pistol and fires at Iris. She jerks back through the window and drops to the floor. A couple of shots hit the metal outside.  We see Iris has short hair, platinum white.  In it are a few of the many pins which held the wig securely in place.  She gasps for air, sobbing and hugging her knees, trembling all over. SPREG STANDS on the platform, watching the train disappear, as Engelman runs up.  Spreg looks at the wig i his hand, disgusted.  He turns it and looks inside, at th cap. CLOSE ON THE CAP inside the wig: there is an intricate network of sensors in a grid over the entire underside of the wig.  The sensors are connected by wires, in a patter like the veins of a leaf, bundling to a small, flat metal box, the size of a cigarette case.  It is a SQUID NET. Iris was wired.  Spreg just stares at the SQUID NET, eyes going crazy wide."

Cardboard boxes full of tech gear stacked in the corners, unidentified electronics components piled on a table, cables strung everywhere.  God knows what this stuff is.  There is aluminum foil taped to all the windows.  Fast food cartons, empty Coke cans, pizza boxes everywhere.  The bachelor apartment from hell.  High-tech low-life. He goes into the bedroom.  Mattress on the floor.  Same infernal interior decoration, but this room is dominated by racks of tapes... Squid tapes. Lenny pours himself a vodka from a bedside bottle, takes off his clothes and hangs them over a chair.  He sits on the bed in his underwear, looking lonely and depressed. This is the private Lenny: No plans.  No dreams.  Nothing to look forward to but another day of the hustle. He puts a set of playback trodes carefully on his head, fishes around in a shoe box among a bunch of tapes, squinting at the hand-written labels: they all say \"FAITH.\" Only the dates are different. He selects one and inserts it in the deck, makes some minute adjustments.  Sips his vodka.  Leans back.  Closes his eyes.  And hits PLAY."

Bob Marley singing \"Three Little Birds\".  Faith, covered with a sheen of sweat, sways to the music as she goes into a bedroom.  We follow her. She comes out of the small bathroom with a towel, starts to dry off.  Sunlight comes in the window lighting up Faith like she is in a spotlight.  We move up behind her and take the towel away, and now we see Lenny standing behind Faith in the mirror over the dresser. He puts his arms around her and they sway together to the music.  He runs his fingers in lazy circles over her sweaty belly.  Then leans down and licks the sweat off he shoulder, all the while watching her in the mirror.  A voyeur recording his voyeurism through his own eyes, so h can replay and relive the moment. Their eyes meet in the mirror. They both watch as Lenny slides his hand up under her halter and caresses her nipples.  She moans softly, responding.  She turns to him, and our POV shifts directl to her.  She is right in front of us, in TIGHT CLOSE UP. The intimacy is power."

Lenny goes to the kitchen in his underwear, searches for breakfast in the fridge, which is empty except for a red-white-and-blue 2-stick popsicle. Good morning.

She looks through the windshield, totally distraught, trying to see where the tape landed... and sees the reflection of cop cruiser lights coming down the street. She crouches next to the BMW, trying to blot herself out. And when the cruiser passes, she slumps to the ground, crying, afraid to move."

The place is a fringe hangout, a converted schmata factory transformed into a warren of dark rooms and corridors off the main dance floor.  A thundering labyrinth.  Steel cage-like partitions of chain-link give the place a harsh, concentration-camp atmosphere.  The music is a bass tech-thump, and the clientele are young and on the rough side.  Cybergrunge. There are many large video screens running a continuous montage of wild graphics and images... a flurry of disturbing videos: MTV baptized by William Burroughs. The Fetish is a street-tech hangout, a meeting place for lot of digital-underground types that Lenny knows.  You can buy and sell what you want here: illicit hardware and software, as well as chemicals for the wetware (brain). Lenny and Mace are greeted inside by two suited guys with metal detectors.  They barely notice as they are scanned: it's routine there days.  Mace shows her gun, a Sig Saur 9mm, and her state carry-permit.  The security guys check her pistol like a coat, giving her a claim check. Through the crowd in the lounge Lenny's eyes go immediately to one table.  It seems to be in a pool of light all it's own; or maybe this is just in Lenny's mind SLOW MOTION: Lenny watches a man at the table holding court, with a beautiful young woman sitting next to him. It is TRAN VO.  He's a mover and shaker in the record business: he produces, he manages, he tries to keep everyone in his orbit. The woman is FAITH JUSTIN.  We recognize her from playbac as Lenny's ex-girlfriend.  But now her hair has been dyed jet black and frames her face in a wild tangle.  She is wearing as expensive custom leather jacket over a sheer silk top.  She has on too much make-up, which gives her features a feral-doll quality.  Faith looks like what she is, a rock star wannabe.  But the look is red-hot. Tran looks around the room.  His eyes miss nothing.  And show nothing.  His hand -- unhurried, graceful, remarkabl -- brushes past Faith's cheek, barely touching her.  His fingers pick up a strand of hair, tuck it like a treasure behind her ear... fingers touching her head now... a moment of suspended time. ... and she trembles.  Just a little.  For a second. Tran and Faith are flanked on either side by an entourage consisting of music types, various hangers on, and Tran's personal security force of four: JOEY CORTO, a whippet- thin skinhead; DUNCAN, a none-too-bright armbreaker in th classic mold; a massively built ex-jock type called WADE BEEMER; and a sixteen year old Asian stone fox, CINDY MINH, aka 'VITA', possibly the most lethal of the four."

Looking up again, to see our running companion... a beautiful lithe woman in shorts and T-shirt.  She laughs and we speed up.  An exquisite moment of pure life force. TIGHT ON TEX'S FACE... as a tear leaks from the corner of his eye.  He is smiling like he is listening to beautiful music.  We see the quiet magnificence of Lenny's gift. Tex opens his eyes.

Faith starts to sing. Beautiful, unearthly, clear notes. SUDDENLY the band kicks down with a wall of thundering sound.  Faith explodes into motion.  Her body convulses like a 440 volt mainline is hooked up to her.  Her voice becomes a scream, an inchoate wail, a police siren.  The pain and rage of an entire, hell-bent tormented planet on its eve of judgment. Lost in the song, Faith has found herself.  She wheels across the stage, slashing her head up and down so that her hair bursts in the strobe-flashes like flak. A techno-erotic pagan.  A force of nature. Lenny is mesmerized.  He has seen this before, many times But it always has the same effect on him.  He is transported into another world by her, a world in which there is only the two of them. TIGHT ON MACE, eyes on the stage... a big piece of the puzzle suddenly fits.  She's never seen Faith perform before.  Holy shit. Faith doesn't play to the audience, or engage them in any way.  She is merely taking what's in her head and letting it out.  She doesn't care if they are there or not.  Now shrieking into the silence after a climatic downbeat, and holding the note... holding it longer than you believe sh possibly could.  Then nothing. When it is over she just drops the microphone and walk away.  Fuck you."

Opens it quietly and goes outside, moving to the wall dividing this room's balcony from the one next door. The Wearer climbs the railing and, six stories above the pavement, slips around the wall, stepping down onto the other balcony.  We hug the wall, looking furtively into the room.  It is a suite.  In the living room we see a woman making herself a drink at the mini-bar.  She turns... It is Iris.  She is wearing a T-shirt and panties. Probably ready for bed.  She looks like she can't sleep. Pours the Scotch shakily. CUT TO LENNY, the streetlight washing across his face.  H gets suddenly serious with a flash of premonitory dread. IN POV we see Iris go into the bedroom, out of sight.  We can hear the television on in there.  Using a steel jimmy the Wearer slips the latch on the balcony slider and silently opens it, slipping inside. We stalk quietly to the bedroom door, listening to her movements.  Water running in the bathroom.  We come aroun the door frame.  Bedroom dark, bathed in TV glow.  Iris i the bathroom, washing her face with cold water. We move toward her.  Crossing the room as she reaches for a towel.  We are now only a couple of feet away.  She comes out of the bathroom, walking right past us, drying her face.  She lowers the towel, turning away... her eyes whip back.  Widening in terror. She reacts with surprising speed, diving across the bed. We go after her. Her hand goes under the pillow and comes out with a small automatic.  She whips it around toward us but we grab it and twist it away before she can fire.  She smashes the palm of her hand into our face and rolls off the bed, lightning-fast. We follow her as she scrambles up, running through the bedroom door.  Across the living room and down the short hall to the front door.  Closing rapidly on her as she somehow gets the chain off the door and gets out into the hall. Slam!  We tackle her against the far wall of the corridor Our right hand comes into view holding a small electric stunner.  ZAP!  We nail her right in the back between the shoulder blades. She sags to the floor, gasping.  We zap her again.  The Wearer's glance does a 180 both ways down the corridor... nobody in sight.  We clamp our hand over Iris' mouth and drag her back into her room, locking the door. ON LENNY, reacting.  Going white."

Iris can now see herself as the Wearer sees her... wide- eyed with terror, white-lipped, weeping.  Helpless.  And she can feel what he feels. The Wearer's hand goes back into the fanny-pack and pulls out something else.  A black athletic headband.  We slip it over her head, down over her eyes.  A blindfold.  Now she can only see what the wearer sees. And also from the bag we pull... a yellow plastic object. With our thumb we extend the five inch blade of the razor knife, the type with tips that can be broken off by segments when they get dull.  It extends with an ominous clicking sound. We lower it toward her and cut up the middle of her T- shirt, laying it open.  Exposing her torso.  We then look down and slide the knife under the side band of her panties, slicing them off.  We put the knife up to her throat, and she whimpers, afraid to cry out, and then we draw the flat side of the blade across her body as if to tease her with the prospect of her death. MACE LOOKS AT LENNY'S EXPRESSION of dawning horror and pulls the car to the curb about a half-block from the Sunset Sheraton.  Lenny is hyperventilating, shifting in his seat as if ants are crawling over him.  He is experiencing the stalker's exhilaration. IN POV we see the Wearer pull his jogging pants down belo his knees (R-rated please) and reach for Iris.  Kneeling in front of her, he pushes her legs apart and pulls her hips forward onto him, pushing into her. Iris is feeling and seeing what he sees and feels... She feels her own pain and humiliation swirling with the killer's exhilaration. ON LENNY, sweating and barely able to breath.  Mace stops the tape... concerned by Lenny's reaction.  He opens his eyes... Mace see the fear there, of what the tape may reveal.  But he shakes his head.  He has to know.  He pushes her hand away and punches PLAY. IT FLOODS INTO HIS HEAD AGAIN.  The sweaty, grunting horror.  The stalker picks up her slit T-shirt and quickl wraps it around her neck.  He knots it tight and twists one powerful hand into the knot.  The muscles in his forearm look like cables as he turns the knot tighter. The stalker viciously twists the knot a full turn and the T-shirt fabric almost disappears into the skin under her jaw. Via her trodes, Iris watches herself die.  Her death come at the moment of his orgasm which is fed to her... blasting off the planet on total overload... terror, pain death merging with ecstasy and exultation at the same instant. ON LENNY, crying out and grabbing for the trodes, but he just holds onto them, as if they are sucking his brains out of his skull."

Her staring eyes He leans very close to her and stares into one dead eye, the pupil wide, seeing nothing. A burst of static.  End of tape. Lenny opens his eyes.  He fumbles open the car door and practically rolls out onto the sidewalk.  The trodes pull off his head as he lurches up, reeling across the sidewal to a darkened storefront where he leans for support.  He doubles over and heaves up the contents of his stomach. Mace circles around the car and catches him as he sags to his knees.  She holds his shoulders while he throws up again."

A MANILA ENVELOPE stuck between the steel bars and the glass of hi front window, next to the door.  \"NERO\" is printed on the envelope. Oh shit.  He opens the door, looking both ways.  No-one i around.  He fishes out the envelope from behind the bars and takes it inside.  Of course it contains a tape.  He stares at it with dread. Lenny sits down and put the tape in his playback deck.  H picks up the trodes and places them on his head.  He notices his hands are shaking.  He takes a deep breath an punches PLAY. POV SEQUENCE: DAY.  As expected we see the de-saturated signature look of the killer's vision.  The Wearer is walking through the courtyard of Lenny's apartment building.  We recognize it by the unkempt pool, the sunke deck furniture.  We walk through a breezeway to an ally- like courtyard behind the building.  We approach a door.. the back door to Lenny's apartment. The killer picks the lock on the back door.  Opens the door and enters.  The apartment is dark, blacked out.  We are in the kitchen.  We stop and listen.  Water dripping in the sink.  Soft snoring from the living room. Moving to the other room.  Slowly, silently.  Furtively looking around the door frame to the living room.  There is Lenny, crashed out on the couch. Now moving stealthily toward him.  Kneeling down beside him.  Lenny, burned out from the night before, is deep under.  Our hand comes into view, holding the yellow plastic razor knife.  With his thumb, the killer extends the blade... click, click, click, click. The blade flashes in a beam of sunlight as it moves towar Lenny.  The killer lays it gently against Lenny's throat. Draws it slowly across... not leaving a mark. The POV backs away and -- static as the tape ends. LENNY, IN THE PRESENT, whips off the trodes, freaking.  H feels around his throat with one hand... can't feel anything. Crossing quickly to a mirror near the front door, he inspects his neck minutely.  There is a hair-line red lin over his carotid.  He looks around the room wildly, his heart hammering.  Slowly, he gets his breathing under control. Then... he hears something in the kitchen.  A tiny click. His eyes go wide.  Hyperventilating, Lenny moves silently into the bedroom.  He fishes around under the bed and pulls out a GLOCK 22 .45 auto pistol.  He stalks silently toward the kitchen. Then he looks at the butt of the pistol-grip: no magazine He un-stalks back to the bed and finds a loaded magazine under a bunch of dirty socks.  He inserts it quietly, wincing as he chambers a round. Heart thudding, he works his way to the kitchen door.  He edges around the frame, pie-ing the room.  Cop reflexes intact. Mace is sitting at the kitchen table, giving him a funny look.  She is drinking a cup of coffee, made from the bottle of instant on the counter.  She is dressed casually, in bicycle pants, work boots and oversized nylo jacket over a tank-top."

Spreg sits up, pulling up his shirt to make sure his body armor stopped the slugs.  No blood.  He comes up firing. He and Engelman empty their magazines at the limo as it pulls away.  No damage.  They realize the limo is a bulle proof security model and run to their pickup truck, parke nearby, to give chase. Spreg's face is a mask of rage.

We tumble over a guardrail and roll down an embankment... get up and keep running. Train tracks ahead.  Looking back... here come Spreg and Engelman down the embankment, overtaking us.  We hear the thunder of a train... spinning again to look forward. Freight-train doing fifty on the nearest track.  Almost t us. We leap forward.  Over the track.  The diesel roars past behind us.  Looking back... a black wall of moving steel. Backing away from it. We see Engelman and Spreg crouching down... trying to aim through the wheels.  Hear the impotent pop of their guns over the roar of the train. Turning to run again.  We see a tiny hole appear in a sig right in front of us with a metallic SPANG.  Running and running. Looking back.  No pursuit.  Train still rolling by.  Can' see the cops.  Running, running.  Heart pounding and lung heaving.  Sobbing sounds coming from somewhere, seeming t fill the night. Looking down... one shoe on, one shoe off.  Iris' hand takes off the remaining shoe, clutches it to her chest. We move forward into the dark train-yard as-- THE TAPE ENDS. And Mace sits stone still.  Shakes.  For a beat.  And another.  Then she tears the trodes off and throws them across the room, near where Lenny is on the cellular."

FAITH, bathed in sweat, walking along a dark corridor backstage.  WE TRACK WITH HER, as she walks through the shadows, like a fighter returning from the ring, soaked and breathing hard. A HAND shoots from a black doorway and covers her mouth, pulling her into the shadows.  Terrified for a split second... before she recognizes that it is Lenny.  He pulls her into the room and closes the door.  It is Tex Arcana's VJ control room, full of monitors and constantly changing graphic images.  Tex is not there."

Lenny sprawls on the floor amid champagne foam and glass. Lenny, blood flowing in his eyes, rises blearily to see Faith being pulled away by Tran, who has her arm twisted viciously behind her back.  They go around a chain-link divider and double back, heading for the exit.  Lenny staggers to the chainlink, sagging to his knees again as Faith passes within a few inches of him.  He slips down the chainlink, into unconsciousness, as her image is lost in the pounding darkness. Mace gets to him through the crowd, and then whirls like cat as the Posse arrives.  She stands guard over him like a rabid dog, her .380 auto straightarmed and covering the expertly.  Corto eyes her with hatred.  The stitches on his nose and the bruised swelling are a reminder of his last run-in with her.  He backs off."

The dress is cut low at th top and high at the bottom, showing plenty of muscular legs.  High heels doing great things for her calves.  Her braids now loose and full, like a mane.

It is the familiar monochromatic vision of the killer.  Our hands open the door quietly with a keycard.  We enter the suite. Some of the lights are on.  We see Faith out on the balcony.  Watching the sea of madness below.  She comes back in, carrying an empty champagne glass.  She grabs a bottle off an end-table and up-ends it.  Empty.  She hurl it across the room, and it shatters against the wall. We approach her, standing with her back to us.  Closer. Only a few feet now.  She whips around, startled.  Gaspin loudly.  But then... she recognizes the wearer."

She has been blindfolded.  The Wearer goes SSSHHH.  A warning.  Like the hiss of a snake.  Our hands seize her wrists and handcuff them one by one to the iron frame at the head of the bed. The hands go out of sight and then reappear holding a set of trodes.  They are placed on her head... the spidery gecko-hand device almost disappearing in her black hair.

Our hands reach down and slowly slit her dress open, starting between her breasts and going down out of sight. She groans, squirming away from the cold knife.  The killer's hands open the material, exposing her white body which in his peculiar vision is pure ivory.  The knife deftly cuts off her panties. We unbuckle our pants and reach for her, grasping her hips, pulling her to us. ON LENNY, gagging.  Overcome by revulsion and horror, mixing obscenely with the pleasure flooding into him from the tape. BACK TO POV as we pull our belt out of the belt loops of our pants and wrap it around Faith's neck.  Faith begins to pant in tiny rapid breaths.  We tighten the belt slowly. LENNY tears the trodes from his head.  He clutches his stomach, gasping for breath.  Carrying the playback deck, he staggers into the bedroom... to the bed.  He stares wildly around the room. One whole wall of the bedroom is mirrored.  In the mirror he spots a shape, on the floor beyond the bed.  It is covered in the bed sheet, but it is clearly a human form, propped up against the wall on the far side of the night stand.  He missed it in his earlier look from the bedroom door. Lenny moves around the bed and reaches down to the foot o the figure, grasping the edge of the sheet with a trembling hand.  With horrified apprehension he pulls on the sheet. It reveals the head and upper body of... Tran Vo. The last thing he expected.  Lenny leans close and sees that Tran is breathing shallowly, but his eyes are vacant He looks like Tick did. Lenny sits on the bed and puts the trodes back on.  The fireworks and screaming outside sound like some nightmarish war, like the sound of the world coming to an end.  But all Lenny cares about is what's on the tape.  H hits PLAY. THE POV CONTINUES where it left off.  Faith's body lurche with the Wearer's thrusts.  His hand tightens the belt. Lenny feels the climax building. Faith's body shakes as the killer comes... she cries out herself, in pain... or is it?  The killers hand releases the belt.  We see Faith gasping for breath and moaning. Suddenly the POV whips sideways to the mirrored closet doors along one wall.  In the mirror is a reflection of the bed and on it Faith.  And on her... ... MAX. Pants down, her legs pulled up around him.  They are both gasping for breath, spent, following their shattering orgasms.  He runs his hands over her sweat-slick belly. LENNY is stunned beyond his power to imagine.  He does no have the strength or the will to stop the tape. IN POV Max's hands remove her blindfold.  She looks right at us, still gasping with the aftershocks of her pleasure Max's hands undo the handcuffs, freeing her.  She reaches for us, her eyes glittering with sated lust.  We slump forward onto her, and her face fills the POV."

His \"hair\" comes off in her hands.  A prosthetic wig, containing the squid-net array.  Max's head is shaved to Sinead O'Connor stubble.  He looks demonic, grimacing wit effort as he struggles with Lenny. He continues firing.  The shots hit the mirrors.  ANGLES of the reflected images of them shattering.  Faith, screaming, reflected, her face fragmenting into shards. The crystal chandelier shatters, reigning glassy snow on them from above. Max is stronger and heavier than Lenny, but Lenny has one advantage: Max has managed to make him really angry. Lenny gives a guttural cry and drives Max backward into the doorframe.  They tumble together into the living room falling together over the couch.  Lenny pounds Max's hand against the glass coffee table, shattering it.  He forces Max's hand along a glass edge, cutting it, and Max drops the gun.  Lenny reaches for it, but Max kicks it away a split-second before his hand touches it.  It skitters under the couch, out of play. Max punches Lenny brutally in the face, then in the gut, and grabs him with both hands.  He hurls him against the wall.  Lenny staggers off the wall into several vicious punches from Max.  We feel the tide turning.  Lenny goes down to one knee. Max pulls out his knife and flicks it open.  Lenny throws a lamp.  Max ducks and charges through.  Lenny spins away from the downthrust. The knife embeds itself in his shoulder blade, sunk into the bone.  Lenny punches Max in the throat and jerks away pulling the knife handle out of Max's hand.  Max tackles him and they crash together through a sliding glass door onto the balcony.  Explosion of flying glass. Max pulls a dazed Lenny to his feet and rushes him backward toward the railing.  At the last instant, Lenny twists with all his strength and spins Max into the railing, using his weight against him.  He pushes hard an Max topples. As he is going over, Max grabs Lenny's tie, pulling him over.  Max is dangling 12 stories above the oblivious crowd, his entire weight hanging from Lenny's tie.  Lenny has one arm and one foot hooked around the railing, and h is being strangled by the tie. Lenny is starting to black out.  In agony he gropes with his free hand to his own shoulder blade, finding the handle of the knife.  He jerks it out of himself.  Max sees it coming a split second before it happens. Lenny slashes the knife across the tie, just above Max's hands. Max takes the express elevator to Hell.  He hits 12 stories down, on top of a video truck. Lenny stands there panting, bleeding down the back of his jacket.  Faith runs to the railing and looks down.  All the strength goes out of her legs.  She sags to the floor Fireworks continue to boom across the sky. Lenny looks down at her, gazing at the object of his quest.  She looks up at him, her wet eyes seemingly at th bottom of a deep well from which he cannot save her. He turns and walks away.  It's hard.  But he keeps walking."

Engelman catches a glimpse of Mace running.  He points to her position and Spreg charges after her.  He has his baton laid back along his forearm and is clubbing people out of the way as he runs. Mace sprints barefoot through the crowd, pushing people out of her way.  Strobe-lights from the stage and flashes from the fireworks give the crowd a nightmarish look. Spreg fires at her.  People drop, their screams drowned out by the pandemonium.  The gunshots don't register abov the concussions from the fireworks.  No one notices the shootings.  Spreg continues to fire, missing her as peopl block his shots.  Mace won't fire back in the crowd. ON SPREG, coming to a stop at the base of a lighting tower.  He has lost sight of her.  He starts to reload hi pistol.  Mace comes up to him silently from behind the tower and hammer punches him behind the ear with the butt of her pistol. Spreg comes around with a roar, slamming the baton across her forearm.  Her .380 clatters to the ground.  Mace bodyslams him back against the steel tower, smashing her palm up under his chin.  His head raps off the metal. Mace is like a she-panther.  She rips the baton out of hi hands and cracks him once across the windpipe.  He drops to his knees, gagging and unable to breathe. A shot hits the metal space-frame next to her head.  She spins to see Engelman, charging toward her.  Before he ca fire again she drops behind the kneeling, gasping Spreg, using him as a human wall.  She clamps an arm around his neck, controlling him, and pulls his tazer from his belt. She shoots Engelman in the chest from 8 feet.  He convulses and drops instantly to the pavement, flopping like a fish.  She holds the current on him while she goes over and kicks his gun away. She takes Engelman's cuffs from his belt.  Spreg glares a her through the blood running into his eyes.  She raises the baton."

They jump the cops, swarming them, wrestling them down. It becomes a brawl. Then cops are running in from everywhere.  We see the trigger point of a full-scale riot.  Cops in full riot- gear, with Lexan shields, push the crowd back, clearing a space.  A helicopter XENON comes straight down from above like the divine light of God. Mace hugs herself, at the center of it, unable to get up. Within seconds there are twenty cops there, and more on the way, forming a human wall.  They get the crowd settle down. Through the phalanx of riot cops comes Palmer Strickland and several ranking officers.  He surveys the scene. Strickland looks down at Mace and then at Spreg and Engelman, who are getting to their knees, though still handcuffed to each other and the steel tower.  The beat extends... Strickland unreadable, face stern as Moses. Then... He points at the two prone cops."

A huge chanting and cheering, that becomes thunderous as everyone begins to shout the countdown to midnight."

The door slams.  Strickland gets in next to her.  The driver starts the car.  They start to move, and... There is pounding on the glass, startling her, and... The door is wrenched open... A hand comes in, grabbing her arm, pulling her out... Lenny.  His eyes are full of emotion. He grabs her in his arms, fiercely, and kisses her... lik there's no tomorrow.  She grabs his head and won't let hi break, even if he wanted to, which he doesn't. Strickland, in the car, rolls his eyes and looks at his watch.  Reflex.  Because if there's one time you don't need a watch, it's..."
