Blair, in silent awe, stands over the badly burned corpse of two interlocking dogs, that lie before him on a table. They are connected as if they were one animal. Though, th one wearing the remnants of Clark's bandage is much large and appears less dog-like. Its entire torso is cracked an peeled, as if its innards were trying to burst out. Odd appendages, recoiled and withered by the flame, are  wrapped grotesquely about both bodies. Clark, his eyes set in glassy stare, sits in shock. Nauls comforts him. Childs stands nearby smoking a joint and st at the floor. Blair, transfixed, continues hovering over the united  cadavers. Weighing. Thinking. A very worried look on his  face. The dead bodies of two other dogs from the kennel are not far off."
