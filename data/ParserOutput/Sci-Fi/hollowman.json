At the far end of the tube, we see a  gloved hand dangling a rat. The hand shoves the  frightened rat into the tube and closes the door behind  it. The rat s stark white fur bristles and it begins to  pad down the tube s length. After several feet, the tube opens up into a dimly lit  cubicle. The rat hesitates and stops. The SOUNDS of gentle BREATHING whispers in the rat s  ears. The rat turns round to head back down the tube, but a  door swings shut, trapping it in the cubicle. The rat cowers as the BREATHING turns to SNORTING. The rat s head jerks around, looking for signs of danger, but the cubicle is empty. The rat sees a water dish on  the far side of the cubicle - a place to hide - and  dashes toward it. But an invisible force descends. The rat squeals in agony as something smashes down on its body, crushing it. A LOUD BELLOW rings out, and the rat flies into the air,  halting a few feet off the ground. Its body writhes,  struggling against the unholy force. Then a sick crunch of tiny bones snapping. All life  quickly drains from the levitating body. Dead eyes... The creature s corpse floats in mid-air. Then the white  fur of the rat explodes in a shower of blood. HUGE BLOOD SMEARED INCISORS appear, as do the red-slicked ape- like lips. The gaping bloody mouth bites again into  the rat."

He pecks a few keys and the molecule shifts  slightly, then falls apart. Sebastian pulls a twinkie from a hostess box, unwraps the cellophane and sucks it down. He attacks the keyboard  with renewed vigor. Another molecule appears on the screen. Sebastian s  fingers fly across the keyboard. The molecule blinks on  and off, it trembles and twists apart."

So Superman starts thinking,  \"man... this is too easy. I could go  down there, do a little fast pumping  and be gone before she even sees me.\"  After all he is faster than a speeding  bullet, right? Anyway, he swoops down,  takes care of business so quick, you  can't even see him. Well ... I tell  ya. Wonder Woman looks up, surprised  as hell and says \"What the hell was  that.\" And the Invisible Man replies  \"I dunno know, but it sure hurt like  hell.\""

The fog wipes away, seemingly by  itself. But then through the window we see Matt walk into the  living room and put his arms around Linda's waist. We  hear a shocked intake of air. He kisses her neck and then slowly unzips her dress. Her  dress falls to the floor. Matt takes off his sport coat  and drapes it over a chair, while Linda unfastens the  buttons of his shirt. They're laughing now, exchanging  kisses. Matt reaches behind Linda and unhooks her bra. He kisses  his way down her neck to her breasts. Linda pulls him to  her. Suddenly the window shatters. Startled, both Matt and  Linda jump back covering themselves. We hear Sebastian's footsteps as he retreats down the  fire escape. A moment later Matt reaches the window and peers out.

And  because of the water displacement, we can clearly see two arms pushing Kramer beneath the water's surface.  MARTHA KRAMER opens the bedroom window and looks down at  the pool. All she can see is her husband drowning... his  flailing limbs kicking up a massive air bubble around  him. She races from the window. Kramer kicks and flails  for a few moments and then his limbs stop moving. A  moment later he floats to surface, face down. The AIR  POCKET bobs over to the pool ladder, and rising from the  pool, we see Sebastian's body outlined in sheets of  water. The shape melts away in a cascading waterfall  until all we can see of Sebastian are the hundreds of  tiny droplets still clinging to his body, caught in the  light like twinkling bulbs on a Christmas tree. The shape disappears into the darkness. A moment later Martha  emerges from the house and sees her husband floating face down in the pool. She screams."
