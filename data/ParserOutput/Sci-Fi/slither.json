He notices a strip of the same slime leading out of the crater itself and into the woods. Grant, curiously, slowly, follows the slimy trail. He comes to a flurry of colorful wild flowers. Something is rustling the flowers ever so slightly. He moves in closer. A gelatinous yellow organism slithers sluggishly between the flowers. The organism is a mound a few inches high, gross and veiny, yet as colorful as the flowers around it. A small cavity on the apex of the organism constricts and expands lightly. I guess it's not worth keeping secre that this thing looks a tad like a bright yellow vagina."

The deer tries to stumble forward again, but its whole head and neck have been knocked askew. It topples over, dead. Bill flips the shotgun forward into his hands. He stuffs the muzzle into the tumorous doe biting into his leg. The deer looks at him. Blood is running down Bill's face and he looks half-crazed. Bill glances down and sees the telephone wire wrapped around her ankle. Bill pulls the trigger, destroying her. He stands, looking around for the deer with Trevor. It has dragged him a fair distance down the street. Bill SHOOTS once, missing it, and again, hitting it straight on.
