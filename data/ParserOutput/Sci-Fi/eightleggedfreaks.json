Before it can strike, Ashley gets her eyes clear and drops the cloth. The cloth lands on the floor atop the spider. As the beast stares out from under it, barefoot Ashley steps on the cloth.

The spider reels, striking the burner knobs, turning on the gas. Gladys registers the sound of ESCAPING GAS. She looks back toward the fuse box and makes a run for it. As she goes, the tarantula fires a webline at her. Gladys gets the fuse off the top of the fuse box, but the webline prevents her from slotting it home. Gladys strains with all    her might, finally slots the fuse. She turns toward     the kitchen just in time to se the broken burner spark    to life. The gas ignites. The tarantula is engulfed in    flame. Gladys is knocked down by the blast. She lies on her back when a second male tarantula nails her with a webline. Gladys screams as she's dragged across the floor toward the basement door. The fire grows more intense, spreading quickly."
