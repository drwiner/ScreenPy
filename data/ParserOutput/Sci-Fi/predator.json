Inside the chopper, one man remains, stretched out agains the bulkhead, as if asleep.  He stirs, sits up, lighting up a CIGAR.  With fatigue showing in his motion, he leans forward, descending to the ground. A JEEP pulls to stop, the man swinging casually into the front seat, tossing his GEAR into the rear.  With a lurch the jeep heads out towards the command post. In the doorway TWO MEN solemnly watch as the jeep approaches.  Reaching the command post the man alights from the jeep, heading towards the two men. Into the pool of light cast by the fixture above the door steps MAJOR ALAN SCHAEFER, the team leader, 38, an intelligent and intense man.  He informally salutes, GENERAL H.L. PHILIPS, 55, hardened, close-cropped graying hair, his nameplate and insignia identifying him as a member of an elite commando unit in the U.S. Army.  He clasps Schaefer warmly on the shoulder."

Mac spins, hauling the heavy gun around, just as something crashes into his upper body, driving the huge man into the foxhole. A desperate battle for life ensues, illuminated with the strobing light of the descending flare.  Mac's enraged SHOUTS and ROARS mingled with horrific SCREAMS fill the night.

The Hunter reloads his WEAPON which turns INVISIBLE again.  Dillon continues to fire.  The Hunter's weapon appears from below, cutting into Dillon's unprotected abdomen, which, as if hit by a samurai sword, bursts open.  Dillon CRIES OUT as the huge man hits the ground."

Covering his finger in BLACK PAINT he applies dark slashes under his eyes and again, vertically down his cheeks.  Taking another dap of paint he makes a SYMBOL on his bare skin, over his heart. He drops the tin, withdrawing his COMBAT KNIFE.  Holding the knife he grasps the MEDICINE BAG around his neck, yanking it free with a quick snap.  He wraps the leather thong around his hand and knife, binding the weapon and bag together. Staring outward, as if in a trance, he begins a low CHANT.

On a flattened section of rock, Schaefer drags a large section of BRANCHES INTO VIEW, adding it to a growing mound of FIREWOOD.  He kneels, tending to a pile of DRIES GRASS, LEAVES and other tinder.  Using the last of his precious matches, he sets fire to the tinder, gently coaxing the tiny blaze into a slowly consumming FIRE, flames starting to lick upward through the dry wood. He stands, staring into the rapidly growing blaze.  He turns, facing the canyon rim, raising his weapons in one hand.  From the depths of his soul, a SOUND emerges; primitive and visceral, as if from an animal in pain. He throws back his head and SHOUTS."
