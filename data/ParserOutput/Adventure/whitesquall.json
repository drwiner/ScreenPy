Skipper meets Chuck's eyes and those of his mates.  Only now is his job finished.  He beams back.  The music swell like an anthem, building, like a swell lifting a small wooden boat over a jagged reef, until it rests safely in the calm waters beyond. The crew come together around Skipper one last time.  The embrace."
