The room is brightly lit by sunlight, the first since she moved here, and the sky out the windows is blue with white clouds. She smiles, remembering, and turns to her bag with the ghost eyes and snow globe with her parents inside. She opens it up, and searches, shoving aside ghost eyes and garden shears. But the snow globe is GONE! She gets on all fours, starts searching the floor. Her hand hits a small PUDDLE by the fireplace, with tiny bits of BLUE SNOW. A drip plops down, then another. She looks up to the mantel and spots the MISSING SNOW GLOBE. She stands up and finds that it's BROKEN OPEN, and neither her parents or the fountain bears are inside. As the last of the snowy liquid drains from the globe, Coraline's face clouds with confusion and fear: What does this mean and where are her parents? Then her WONDERFULLY REAL MOTHER calls to her."
