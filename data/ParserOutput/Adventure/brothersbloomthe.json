Years went by, and the boy's friend became a young man, and one day while drinking in town (which in his guilt he did quite a lot of) he heard that a well was being built near the forest... with the stones from the quarry. He ran to the quarry to find it nearly empty... no stones, no body. He ran to the well where the masons were finishing their work. `Did they find anything strange in the quarry?' he asked, expecting, maybe hoping they'd arrest him for the awful crime on the spot. But no, they said, motioning to the well. Nothing strange. Just stones. They left him alone there at the well, and he stood looking into it as the sun fell behind the mountains and twilight set the world in a deep, still silence. The last image we land on is the well, alone in the clear Its dark innards loom ominously in the long pregnant sile that follows. Then, with a piercing ROAR, a living monster of stone lun out of the well, animated and terrifying, grabs the frien the throat and with a crunching of bones and one last roa pulls him back down into the depths of the well.
