I think about all those  people who tended and picked the  grapes, and if it's an old wine, how  many of them must be dead by now. I  love how wine continues to evolve,  how every time I open a bottle it's  going to taste different than if I  had opened it on any other day.  Because a bottle of wine is actually  alive -- it's constantly evolving  and gaining complexity. That is,  until it peaks -- like your '61 --  and begins its steady, inevitable  decline.
