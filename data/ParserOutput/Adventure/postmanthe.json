Holnists and Carriers alike begin to move forward for a better look. The fight is fierce. Bloody. The Postman and Bethlehem are at each other like coiled snakes. It's more of a fight than any of the Holnists -- especially Getty -- expected. The spectators pull in tighter. Both combatants have taken a beating -- and still, they fight on -- trading bloody, raw-knuckled punches. One of Bethlehem's connects. The Postman loses his footing, hits the ground -- knocking his head on a rock with a resounding CRACK. Dazed, he's slow to rise. It's just the moment Bethlehem needs, he straddles the fallen Postman, reaches for his knife with one hand -- grabs The Postman's throat with the other."
