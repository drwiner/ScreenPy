The UmbyCords are uncoiled and plugged into ports in the back of the game-pods. The shirts, blouses, and jackets of the volunteers are lifted at the back to reveal their owners' bioports, whic are small, soft-plastic, flesh-coloured permanent spinal jacks positioned just above the belt line. Twenty-two folding chairs are placed in a circle on the dais. As each volunteer has his UmbyCord plugged into his bioport, he takes one of the seats and places his quiveri rippling game-pod, now connected directly to his nervous system, on his lap. The last chair is taken by Allegra Geller, who is fussed i over and settled by Levi as she unpacks her own master pod with exaggerated delicacy and is then ported in to th players on either side of her. We END the short MONTAGE with the security guard, Pikul, standing with arms folded near the church's side door, watching the proceedings with fascination.

The players are all emerging from a game that has just en - the movie we have been watching - and they begin to sti in their game gear, which is nothing like the organic pod technology we have just seen. On the contrary, the garners are wearing head-gear with electrodes, more like normal clunky Virtual-Reality equipment, and are linked by mundane wires. In their laps they hold, not game-pods, but sleek plastic game modules, each about the size of a walkman, with holes into Which I their left thumbs are inserted - a simpler and cruder version of the bioports we have become used to.

Don't hold back. After that, we're going to form a focus group where we'll discuss details of each of your experiences playing TranscendenZ.
