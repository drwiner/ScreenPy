Hi Brion at work! Best case scenario is they notify the police and after a 24 hour hold they file a report, a missing persons report. Which means noon tomorrow it's official that I'm gone. I do still have the tiniest bit of water left. Well, actually, I've resorted...I've had a couple pretty good gulps of urine that I saved in my Camelbak. I sorta let it distill...it tastes like hell. So it's 70 hours since I left on my bike from Horseshoe Trailhead during which time I have consumed 3 liters of water and a couple mouthfuls of piss. Pause. Did I say the weather is great? Well, it is. Though flash floods potential is still present. There's 4-prong major canyons upstream from me that all converge in this 3 foot wide gap where I am. The rock I pulled down on top of me, it was put there by flood."

As we reverse back on Aron in the canyon there's a burst light and color beyond him and on the sofa in the canyon little boy sits. He's blond, about 3 and in a red polo sh He looks like Aron. Aron walks towards him, the sunlight hits his face like a train and Aron looks up to it but keeps moving towards th boy, walking downhill towards the sofa. The boy leaps off sofa and comes running to Aron. 62. He scoops the boy up with his left arm and balances him around his shoulders with his right handed stump. The boy holds Aron's arms in his little hands and they prance aro the sofa, they giggle and shout playing bulls, giraffes, elephants, jousting knights, pretending to walk downhill behind the sofa. Like any father in any park. [A PERFECT SONG, BLONDIE MAYBE, PLAYS IN THE DISTANCE]. Like any fat in any park. Aron watches the image begin to fade. He switches on the light but its low and feeble. As the images on the inside of the bag fade so too does Aron's lamp. He tries to warm it up but it fades to black holds his breath."
