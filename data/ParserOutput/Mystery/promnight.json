Two faded yellow buses stand ready. The lull is shattered by the CLANGING of the final BELL. A swarm of children pours out the door and down the broad front steps, scattering across the lawn toward the cars and the buses. Moving slowly through the crowd, ROBIN and ALEX HAMMOND, nine-year-old identical twins, appear at the doorway.. Attractive, dark-haired children, they seem more sub- dued than the others. As they walk quietly down the stairs, Robin lags behind, staring at a boy teasing a girl nearby. He is NICK MCBRIDE, eleven years old, two grades ahead of Robin and the most popular boy in school. The pretty girl laughing at his antics is KIM HAMMOND, also eleven, Robin's older sister."

Robin pushes on a makeshift wooden door. It slips off its temporary hinges, crashing down to the floor. The NOISE is like a rifle shot; suddenly, there is ABSOLUTE SILENCE in the structure. Petrified, Robin crouches behind a wall, waiting. The CHANTING quickly RESUMES and she breathes a long sigh of relief. Robin moves through a dark corridor, hugging the walls. Flushed with excitement, she imagines herself a \"killer\" searching for Wendy. As she moves past an empty room, she hears a SOFT GIGGLE. Robin stops and listens care- fully. Once again she hears the GIGGLE, LOUDER this time, coming from nearby. Stepping to a doorway, she leans around the corner and peers inside. In the darkness she can see nothing. Gathering her courage, she quietly slips into the room. The room appears empty but a closet door is slightly ajar. As Robin approaches, she hears a FAINT GASP from behind her. Whirling around, she sees Wendy crouched behind a cardboard box in the corner."

This stuf- fy, dour science teacher drones on about the joys of ex- ploring frog vertebrae while most of his class naps, daydreams or passes notes. Seated in the back near the door, Jude is furtively opening a handwritten note. She quickly reads it. Stifling a giggle, she looks up to see Kim and Vicki across the aisle, eagerly awaiting her reply. Jude tears out part of a page from her biology book and scrawls her answer. Folding the note, she taps the boy next to her and motions for him to pass it on. Vicki grabs the note from the boy. Quickly scanning it, she nods, impressed. Kim reads it and mouths the word \"Wow\" to Jude who blushes happily. Glancing out into the hallway, Jude notices Slick walk- ing past. Seeing her in class, he stops and waves. Jude frantically tries to motion him away. Their backs to the door, Kim and Vicki watch with curiosity as Jude gestures in their direction. Seeing her friends watching her, Jude smiles and tries to ignore Slick. Not to be denied, he exaggeratedly mimes Weller, nose to his textbook, lecturing on, oblivious to his class. Jude laughs in spite of herself. Kim and Vicki turn around. Glancing out the door, the two girls stare in disbelief at the small weird curly-haired boy doing a perfect im- itation of the eminently boring Weller. Their surprise turns to hilarity as they realize this boy must be Jude's prom date. Kim holds up the note, raising her eyebrows as she gestures toward Slick. Jude nods. Kim and Vicki can barely contain their laughter. They do not notice Mr. Weller eyeing them suspiciously as he rattles on about frog intestines. Slick mouths the words, \"See you at lunch.., in the van.\" Jude nods and smiles. With a final bow and a wave, he exits. Kim suddenly looks up to find a red-faced Mr. Weller looming above her.
