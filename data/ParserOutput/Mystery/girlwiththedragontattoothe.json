The figure is too soft to identify - even with a magnifying glass - but is wearing a light-colored dress and has light hair. He glances to the family tree on the wall - the teenage Vanger girls' photos - Three INSERTS:   Harriet ... Cecelia ... Anita ... They all have light hair, and, frankly, all look alike. He moves on to the parade pictures. To the one Vanger said before was the last picture taken of Harriet alive. It's not really of her."

He adjusts the size function - closer on Harriet gets rid of the dissolve effect and music and reduces the time interval to make the transitions as quick as possible. He hits `play' again and watches a short jerky `silent film'- a kind of electronic flip-book: Harriet arrives with her friends. Moves along the street. Stops and faces the parade. Says something to her friends. Laughs. Watches the float with the harem girls on it. Smiles. Sees something to her left. Turns her head slightly toward it. Her eyes widen in fear. She looks down. She moves off. Her friends look after her confused. And then she's gone. Blomkvist backs up to the frame of Harriet looking off with fear in her eyes, and for the first time believes without a doubt what Vanger has believed for 40 years: She was murdered. Whoever she saw across the street followed her and killed her. The cat watches him."

Crawls desperately around and behind the ruins. Sees his shirt is bloody but can't feel a wound under it. Touches his face and finds the blood is coming from his forehead. He can see no one, and is almost relieved since if he could it would mean they were walking toward him, which would mean he would soon be shot dead, point blank. He has to get out of here before that happens. Behind him - the rocky cliff he just climbed. Ahead of him - a clearing leading to woods. Really only one choice - He runs for the trees. Dives through a curtain of thicket and stinging nettles that tear at his arms and hands. Crawls the rest of the way to the woods on his elbows and toes like an infantryman. Safe for the moment, he figures, hidden in the woods, he looks at the sun low in the sky, and decides to wait."

Salander flips through the handwritten notes she made during her talk with the retired detective in Landskrona and finds that part-time palm reader Rakel's main job was as a cleaning woman for Carlen Construction. The detective interviewed her co-workers, but no one from Vanger Industries, including that firm's representative in town for a few days, Gottfried Vanger. Gottfried Vanger ... which one was he again? Salander brings up on her laptop photographs she took of the wall of the cottage: the Vanger family tree. Gottfried Vanger, Son of Margareta & Richard the Nazi Husband of crazy Isabella, Father of Martin and Harriet Of all the Vangers - at least back in 1950 when Harriet was born - Gottfried was the most handsome. Clark Gable good looks. She puts a check next to Rakel's name and returns to Mari Holmberg and the 1954 Vanger files."

There's a photo of Henrik presenting someone with a Best Worker of the Year plaque. And another taken at a dinner for twenty guests and Vanger family members: The camera has captured Henrik presiding at the head of the table, putting on a brave face, raising a champagne flute - as everyone else does the same - except for the young man at the far right foreground. He looks sullen. But what teenager wouldn't at an event as boring as this. Salander would look even more sullen.

He struggles up to his knees, and she swings the club again, splitting flesh and crushing bone as he crumples the floor. She takes the gun from the bench and shoves it in her other back pocket. Grabs the hunting knife and shackles key and hurries over to Blomkvist who only witnessed part of the spectacle before losing consciousness - She saws through the leather strap around his neck. Unlocks the chain. As he sinks to his knees on the floor, blood rushes to his head, bringing him back to life just enough to see what she can't behind her - Martin, blood streaming from the gash in his head, getting to his feet. But he's not coming at them; he's trying to get out - Blomkvist tries to say her name to get her to look. Lifts a hand to try to point. She turns and glimpses the monster as he disappears out the steel door. Looks back at Blomkvist, still handcuffed on the floor, and, like a child asking a parent for permission - SALANDER"

The beauty of her city pleases Salander as she rides through it on her motorcycle. Or maybe it's something she's feeling as she turns onto Blomkvist's street. She parks. Gathers the garment bag and card, walks under construction scaffolding toward his apartment building. From around the corner ahead, Blomkvist and Erika appear. He says something and she laughs, puts her arm around his waist and lays her head against his neck scarf. Salander stops mid-stride, ducks into an alcove under the scaffolding, waits as long as it should take them to get inside the building, then peers out again - They're not inside. They've stopped just outside the building's entrance. They're embracing. And the longer they stand there together, the sharper the pain stabs at Salander. Finally they separate, but only to allow Blomkvist to unlock the door. Erika takes his hand then, and they disappear inside."
