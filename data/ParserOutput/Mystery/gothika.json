The bolts pop out of their sockets. The LIVE WIRE uncoils like some gigantic serpent and swings straight towards the paralyzed Miranda -- She looks down at her feet, ankle-deep in the puddle, back up at the 11,000 VOLTS OF POWER about to fry her to a crisp and jumps out of the way at the last second. The wire hits the water and the monumental charge sends SPARKS flying in every direction. It looks like lightning. A silent, sudden beat.   That was as close as close gets. MIRANDA (fighting tears)"

She tugs on the wall and opens it to the limits of the chain, but that's only a few inches more. Miranda peers into the darkness beyond, but can't see a thing. Hesitating only a moment, she turns sideways and slides herself into the claustrophobic slot. She moves forward cautiously a few feet until her face brushes against something hanging in the air. She stops, startled. It's a pull-string hanging from a naked light bulb. She tugs on it. And now she has 60 watts of reddish glow to see the hatch on the floor immediately in front of her. She pulls on the LATCH and it opens with a RUSTY CREAK. She peers into the pitch-black basement below. Feels around for the beginning of a stepladder and climbs down."
