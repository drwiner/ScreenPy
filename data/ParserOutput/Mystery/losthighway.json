Through  sliding glass doors we see nude and semi-nude people  cavorting in a swimming pool.  Everyone has a drink in hi her hand.  Renee finishes her drinkt and hands the empty glass to Fred who walks away with it.  Andy grabs Renee, dances with her.  They laugh and talk.  Renee appears to bit intoxicated. Fred, who appears less than thrilled with the carryings o makes his way to the open bar where he orders two drinks. When the drinks arrive he drains one of them completely, sets the empty glass down on the bar.  Then he swallows t other drink, too, and sets down the glass.

Suddenly, there are two knocks on the other side of the  closed door.  The Slickster moves off the door and opens crack.  He talks quietly to someone Alice can't see, then turns, opens the door and gestures for Alice to go throug Alice puts out her cigarette - her hand is shaking. She walks over past the Slickster and enters a much large room.  There are about FIFTEEN MEN in the room - all lean comfortably at different points on the walls.  There is o one chair in the room - Mr. Eddy is sitting in it. No one says anything to her, but one man nods his head an from this nod, Alice feels she should walk to the center the room.  She does, and she instinctively turns to the m sitting in the chair. They all just stare at her silently.  She looks around  nervously - her eyes return to Mr. Eddy's. Suddenly, a man steps quickly up to her - draws a pistol cocks it against her head. Alice goes weak in the knees.  Her eyes fill with fear. The men continue to stare. Mr. Eddy gives Alice a small gesture as if to say \"well?\" Somehow she knows what they want, even though they haven' asked for it with words. Alice starts to undress - slowly - in as sexy a way as sh knows how. The men just stare without expression. When she is completely naked, Mr. Eddy gestures her over him.  Soon she is on her knees in front of him - making  herself available for whatever he wants. Mr. Eddy's POV - Alice looks in his eyes.  She reaches he hand up to stroke his cheek..."
