     CREDITS COME QUICKLY.
     No flourish, just names.
     And what do we hear?

                          THIS SONG:
               the theme from the television
               series.

                           WHO IS THE TALL DARK STRANGER THERE?
     MAVERICK IS THE NAME.
     RIDING THE TRAIL TO WHO KNOWS WHERE.
     LUCK IS HIS COMPANION.
     GAMBLING IS HIS GAME.
     SMOOTH AS THE HANDLE OF A GUN,
     MAVERICK IS THE NAME.
     WILD AS THE WIND IN OREGON.
     FLOWING UP A CANYON, EASIER TO TAME.
     RIVERBOAT RING YOUR BELL.
     FARETHEEWELL, ANNABELLE,
     LUCKY IS THE LADY THAT HE LOVES THE BEST.
     NATCHEZ TO NEW ORLEANS
     LIVIN' ON JACKS AND QUEENS,
     MAVERICK IS A LEGEND OF THE WEST.
     As the SONG FINISHES --
     -- CREDITS COME TO AN END.

     And the movie begins...

                                                    FADE IN ON:


     EXT. DESOLATE LANDSCAPE - HANGING TREE - DAY

     Rocks. Cactus. The occasional tree.

     Not a place you'd like to spend your summer vacation.

     Now there are sounds: A WHIPPING WIND begins to get LOUDER.
     And in the distance, but GROWING: THUNDER.


     CAMERA STARTS TO MOVE --

     SLOWLY, INEXORABLY, ACROSS this dead place --

     -- suddenly it STOPS.

     We are in a Sergio Leone TIGHT CLOSEUP of just a hideous-
     looking man. One eye looks straight ahead. The other wanders.


     CAMERA MOVES AGAIN.

     The wind is really kicking up --

     -- suddenly, another STOP.

     Another Leone CLOSEUP.

     A second man. This guy makes the first one look handsome.
     Both his eyes work, which is an improvement.

     But his neck has been horribly burned as if from a noose.

     CAMERA IS MOVING AGAIN.

     LOUDER THUNDER.

     CAMERA STOPS.

     We are LOOKING AT the least appetizing of the three.

     that he's scarred, not that all his parts aren't in proper
     working order -- it's just that he's so damn frightening.

     Not to mention huge.
     A storm is coming fast.

     Not

     This is THE ANGEL and like the other two, he is seated on a
     horse. And he is staring intently at something. FROM The
     Angel -- we go to...

     BRET MAVERICK

     for this is who the trio is looking at.
     Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be
     found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library

     MAVERICK's 30, give or take. Enormously appealing.

     Whether that's because of his considerable physical skills or
     his sunny personality, who knows. It might be his quiet wit.

     In any case, we are looking at a handsome young man that
     everybody likes --

     -- oops --

     -- make that almost everybody.

     Because just now he is seated on a horse beneath a tree and a
     thick hope has been tied around his neck, the rope thrown
     over a branch. His hands have been tied behind his back. We
     are about to watch a hanging. His.

                          THE ANGEL
                    (riding closer)
               I almost got hung myself once,
               didn't much care for it, how about
               you?
                    (as Maverick says nothing)
               We're gonna leave now, but I'm
               worried about your well-being.

     Maverick just stares at him, makes no reply.


     THE ANGEL

     He gestures for the other two to ride, and they take off.

                          THE ANGEL
               See, I don't think it's a good
               thing for a man to be alone out
               here. Your mind can do cruel
               things.

     And now he takes a burlap sack, tosses it toward Maverick. It
     lands nearby.

                          THE ANGEL (CONT’D)
               Enjoy the company.

     He spurs his horse, rides away.

     MAVERICK

     managing to turn his head in the direction The Angel took.

               disappearing over a nearby hill.


     EXT. SKY - DAY
     The sky.
     Storm clouds convene.


     EXT. HANGING TREE - DAY

     Maverick. He takes a deep breath, tries to wriggle free of
     the knotted rope around his neck.

     No luck.
     Make that bad luck.

     The horse has been surprised by his movement, takes a half
     step.

     MAVERICK

     Freezing.

                          HORSE
               It relaxes, settles down.


     EXT. SKY - DAY
     The sky, and a THUNDERCLAP.


     EXT. HANGING TREE - DAY

     Maverick, staring at his horse.

     Either the horse is deaf or it likes thunder.

     budge an inch.

     Maverick starts to try and work his neck free again.
     The noise was loud.

                          DOESN'T
               This time the horse doesn't move at
               all. Maverick sighs with relief,
               glances around.

                          BURLAP SACK
               It is starting to wriggle.

               He holds his breath. HORSE
     It hasn't spotted the sack yet.

                          SACK
               Wriggling more. not to spot it.
               MAVERICK
     Pretty soon it's going to be hard

     caution to the winds now, trying desperately to somehow get
     free of the noose --

     -- and miraculously, he's starting to make a little headway.

     HORSE

     Calm. Nothing flusters this animal.

     MAVERICK

     even more headway -- he's in pain but he ignores it.


     EXT. SKY - DAY
     The sky.
     More THUNDER.


     EXT. HANGING TREE - DAY
     The horse.
     Standing still.


     EXT. SKY - DAY
     The clouds are darker.


     EXT. HANGING TREE - DAY
     The horse.
     It could be a statue.

     MAVERICK

     one eye on the sack as he continues to work to free his neck.
     Now --

                          SACK
               as a rattlesnake peeks out.

     MAVERICK

     Jesus.

     HORSE

     Oblivious.


     SACK

     Half-a-dozen rattlers are moving out of the sack now.

     Close by. Some of them are big, some of them are very big.
     All of them have fangs.

     MAVERICK

     struggling harder than ever, and he's actually making more
     headway. It's exhausting labor. As he continues his fight for
     life --

                          MAVERICK (V.O.)
               It had been just a shitty week for
               me from the beginning.

     Now, FROM that --


     FLASHBACK - EXT. ROAD - LONG LENS - AFTERNOON

     A lone rider rides through dusty area up and down dips in the
     road. It is Maverick. He rides a mule. Angel follows and then
     Coop follows.


     EXT. DUSTY CANYON - AFTERNOON

     Maverick rides his mule along dusty trail; as we PAN WITH him
     a wagon train travels in opposite direction; kids play poker
     in the f.g. -- one smokes a corn cob pipe; we CONTINUE PAN
     WITH Maverick and REVEAL the town of Crystal River, a ferry
     coming across the river in the b.g.

                          MAVERICK (V.O.)
               I was heading into Crystal River to
               take some money from the bank.
               Probably I should have expected bad
               luck on the horizon when my horse
               got stolen and I had to replace it
               with something less than a
               thoroughbred.


     EXT. CRYSTAL RIVER - AFTERNOON

     Crystal River. Not much of a place. Dusty. One main street --
     and almost every storefront indicates that it is either a
     saloon or a gambling hall.

     Just now the stagecoach comes off the ferry and drives
     through town kicking up dust.


     EXT. CRYSTAL RIVER - AFTERNOON

     Maverick, riding into town from the other direction, as the
     dust whips up. He's wearing different clothes than in the
     hanging scene.

                          MAVERICK (V.O.)
               My luck had to change fast -- the
               poker game of the century was
               starting in St. Louis in just ten
               days, and I was still short three
               thousand for the entrance fee.

     EXT. STABLES - AFTERNOON

     A stable as Maverick dismounts, does his best to beat some
     dust from his riding clothes. He grabs his saddlebag as a
     STABLE BOY hurries up.

                          MAVERICK
                    (indicating the mule)
               How much?

                          STABLE BOY
               By the day, week or month?

                          MAVERICK
               No-no -- Not how much to take care
               of him, how much to just take him.
               Permanently.

                          STABLE BOY
               Pa. The man wants to sell the
               burro.

                          PA
               That burro's not worth a cent.

     Five dollars.

                          MAVERICK (CONT’D)
               Five dollars. Nice doing business
               with you. Thank you. He doesn't eat
               much. He's a regular jackass ...
               Hee... haw... Hee... haw. Always
               likes to be called Arthur.

     He opens the door. He bumps into Angel. They look at each
     other. Maverick exits and Angel looks and moves inside.

                                                        CUT TO:


     EXT. CRYSTAL PALACE - AFTERNOON

     The biggest establishment in town. This place actually has a
     second floor and advertises rooms as well as vices.


     INT. CRYSTAL PALACE - STAIRCASE - AFTERNOON

     Maverick is starting up the stairs when the REGISTRATION
     CLERK hurries over from his desk.

                          CLERK
               You got a wire, want me to read it
               to you?

                          >MAVERICK
                    (reaching for it)
               No.

                          CLERK
                    (reading)
               It just says, 'Watch your back.'
                    (beat)
               No signature.
                    (hands it over)
               Here.

     Maverick takes it, glances at it, heads upstairs.


     EXT. CRYSTAL RIVER - SUNSET

     The town and river look beautiful as the sun is going down.

     INT. CRYSTAL PALACE - DUSK

     The place is busy enough, the bar doing a brisk business.

     A poker game is in session. Half a dozen play. A cattlehand,
     a preacher, a small-time local businessman.

     But it's the other three we pay most attention to.

     First is a very young man. Late teens, looks less.

     Thin. Small. A hundred and thirty pounds after a big meal.
     This is THE KID. Seems ordinary.

     Next to him sits, of all things, a woman. But not ordinary,
     certainly not in these surroundings. She's elegantly-dressed,
     close to being beautiful. She's married, has a deep Southern
     accent, and hasn't been poor for a long time. Maybe she's
     thirty. She seems a rotten poker player, but a wonderful
     flirt. This is ANNABELLE BRANSFORD.

     Next to her sits The Angel. We met him already -- he tossed
     the burlap bag of rattlesnakes at Maverick just before the
     hanging. Huge, powerful, not much makes him smile, except
     winning at cards.

     There is an empty seat at the table.

     STAIRCASE

     as Maverick descends. If before he was grimy from travel, he
     isn't anymore. He wears a black hat, a black jacket, a black
     string tie --

     -- and just the most beautiful white lace shirt you ever saw.

     POKER GAME

     as Maverick approaches.

                          >MAVERICK
                    (indicating the empty
                     chair)
               Taken?

                          ANNABELLE
                    (lilting Southern accent)
               It is now.
                    (smiles at him)
               My name is Annabelle Bransford. And
               what do people call you?

                          MAVERICK
               Bret Maverick, ma'm.

     And as he starts to sit --

                          THE ANGEL
               glaring at Maverick.
                    (We know that within a
                     week, he'll hang
                     Maverick. But they
                     haven't met before.)

                          THE ANGEL (CONT’D)
               I like the game the way it is.

                          MAVERICK
               I bring all kinds of plusses to the
               table. I hardly ever bluff and I
               never ever cheat.

                          THE ANGEL
               I don't believe it.

                                                       MAVERICK
     Neither do I.

                          THE ANGEL (CONT’D)
                    (voice rising, not in
                     pitch, but intensity)
               I like the game just the way it is.

                          MAVERICK
               Bet I can change your mind.
                    (beat)
               I promise to lose for at least an
               hour.

                          THE ANGEL
                    (without a pause)
               We're playing five card draw.
     As Maverick sits --
     MAVERICK
     losing a hand to The Angel.

     The Angel smiles --
     -- but so does Maverick.
     MAVERICK
     losing again, this time to Annabelle.
     -- but again, so is Maverick.
     She's happy --
     And now we begin a SERIES of VERY QUICK CUTS.
     Of The kid, holding his cards.
     Tightly.
     Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be

     Of the cattleman casually making a bet.
     Very casually.

     Of Maverick, who doesn't seem to be paying much attention.

     He loses again, smiles.

     Now the preacher is staring at his cards before betting.

     For a long beat.

     And the cattleman is fiddling with his chips.

     The chips in front of The Angel are sloppy.

     The chips in front of Annabelle are neatly stacked. She
     flicks her fingernails against her front teeth, makes a bet.

     The businessman is toying with his necktie.

     The Angel is holding his cards, moving the top to the bottom,
     then repeating, the top to the bottom.

     And Maverick loses again, smiles again, just happy to be
     there.

     Annabelle is suddenly helpless, giggling, staring at what
     she's been dealt.

     The Angel is smiling happily.

     The businessman's fingers are tapping on the table.

     The Kid's hand covers his mouth.

     The Angel is bored, looking neither at the other players or
     the pot.
     He rakes in a pot.

     Annabelle bets big and wins -- maybe she's not such a rotten
     poker player after all.

     Maverick tosses in his cards. Another loss. He smiles,
     glances at the clock on the wall -- an hour and a half have
     gone by.


     EXT. CRYSTAL RIVER - TWILIGHT

     It is getting dark. Fewer people move about. A lamp-lighter
     is at work; carriages pass with lanterns lit.

     Two pair, aces over queens. Maverick has three sixes.

     He looks at his winning hand almost in surprise. It's a good
     sized pot he's won. As he reaches for it.

                          THE KID
                    (mumbling something)
               Don't think...

     The rest is unintelligible.

                          MAVERICK
               Didn't get you.

                          THE KID
               I said I don't think that hand
               should count.

                          MAVERICK
               You got any logical reasons going
               for you?

                          THE KID
               My mind wasn't on the game.

     His voice is always soft.

     CLOSEUP - THE KID

     He stares at Maverick and something is suddenly clear: His
     eyes are deadly.

     MAVERICK

     Hesitating now.

                          MAVERICK

                          MAVERICK
               And what do you do for a living?

     I'm a

               Since you're still alive, I have to
               assume you're good at it.

                    (a beat -- then)
               This hand definitely does not
               count.
                    (indicating chips)
               Take whatever you think's yours,
               I'll be content with the leavings.

     As The Kid does --

     ANNABELLE

     A quick look of disappointment crosses her face.

     THE ANGEL

     A look of contempt crosses his.

                                                      THE ANGEL
     You always been gutless?

                    (thinks a minute -- then
                     nods)
               I think so. At least for as long as
               I can remember. My pappy always
               said, 'He who fights and runs away,
               can run away another day.'
                    (now he stands -- like
                     every other man in the
                     room, he wears a six gun)
               Here's the truth -- I don't see
               what's so great about being brave.

     Pulls back his black jacket, clearing his gun.

     KID

     Watching.
     His hand begins to move to his gun.

     ANNABELLE

                    (chatting idly away)
               See, you're a gunfighter and I'm
               not, I like to play cards, so the
               fact is, if I'd faced you down,
               what chance would I have had?
               Answer? Zero.

     MAVERICK

     suddenly he draws -- and it's lightning -- you never saw
     anyone so fast.

     THE KID

     Stunned.


     MAVERICK

     His voice casual.

                          MAVERICK
               No chance whatsoever.

     And now he expertly twirls his gun back into its holster.

     ANNABELLE

     Leaning toward The Kid.

                          ANNABELLE
               Was that fast?
                    (as The Kid manages a nod)
               I thought it was fast.

     MAVERICK

     sitting back down at the table again. This has all gone
     quickly and quietly. Now he looks at The Kid.

                          MAVERICK
               May I suggest that from now on you
               keep your mind on the game?

                                                        THE KID
     Yes. Yessir.

     THE ANGEL

     Not remotely afraid of Maverick.

                          THE ANGEL
               You say you like to play cards?

                                                       MAVERICK

               How come, when you lose all the
               time?

                          MAVERICK
               Oh, I don't lose all the time --
               just the first hour or so. I like
               for people to be happy.

                          THE ANGEL
               What happens after that?

                          MAVERICK
               Probably I'll win all your money.

                          THE ANGEL
               Aren't you a little overconfident?

                          MAVERICK
               No. I've just been here before.


     POKER GAME BEGINNING AGAIN

     And again, we see a SERIES OF VERY QUICK CUTS.

     In fact, we see many of the same cuts we saw before --

     only this time, Maverick doesn't lose, he wins.

     The Kid holds his cards tightly. Too tightly. He makes a bet.
     Maverick doubles it. The Kid folds. He was bluffing.

     The Cattleman casually makes a bet. Very casually.

     Maverick doubles it. Another bluff. Maverick wins again.

     Annabelle is suddenly helpless, giggling.

     Maverick folds. The others bet.

     wasn't bluffing.
     Annabelle wins -- she

     The Angel is guarding his cards with both huge hands. He
     makes a big bet. Maverick makes a bigger one. The Angel
     folds. Angrily. He was bluffing.

     hands. But Maverick's is better. The Angel is bored, makes a
     bet looking at neither the other players nor the pot.
     Maverick makes a big bet. The Angel throws his cards down,
     his anger building as he was caught in another bluff. CLOCK

     MAVERICK'S CARDS

     He has shit.

     THE ANGEL
     Not even a pair.
     This time he was bluffing.

     on his feet with a roar --

                          THE ANGEL
               You said you never bluffed!

                    (very calm, collecting the
                     pot)
               No, I said I never cheated, and I
               don't. I also said I hardly ever
               bluffed. This was one of the
               'hardlys.'

                          THE ANGEL
               You cheated the whole goddam game.

                          MAVERICK
               What do you think I was doing that
               first hour? Learning your 'tells,'
               that's all. Once I could read your
               hands, once I could read you --

     and he's not so casual now. His eyes flick around, looking
     for a place to move.

     FOUR UNSHAVEN BIG MEN

     Three of them fanning out behind the Lead Guy, blocking
     anyplace Maverick might go.

                          LEAD GUY
               I spotted ya through the window and
               it made me believe in The Almighty.

               played bad, whose fault is that?

     FOUR GUYS

     and for just a moment they're surprised.

     THE ANGEL AND ANNABELLE

     out onto the saloon's porch to watch.

     THE ANGEL AND ANNABELLE AND THE OTHERS
     He stops.

     rivited.

     FOUR GUYS

     outside -- they stop too.

     Hey, son. Take this. If they
     get to whooping me, just shoot me.
     Take care of this and make sure it
     doesn't get dirty.

     And now he does something else surprising. He takes off his
     gun belt and his coat and gives them to the boys.

     FOUR GUYS

     Three of them look to the Lead Guy.

     his gun belt too.

                          HE HESITATES, DROPS
               THE ANGEL watching.

     And now the Four Men begin to move slowly toward Maverick.

     MAVERICK

     Four of them and all of them dangerous, four of them coming
     closer in the night.

     And now he does the most surprising thing of all:

     He charges them.

     Eyes bright.

     THE ANGEL

     watching, stunned at what he's seeing out there in the night,
     and --

     MAVERICK

     spinning, throwing an elbow into the gut of the nearest big
     man. The blow connects perfectly and the Guy starts to double
     over, his knees weak, and he falls.

     SECOND BIG MAN

     swinging viciously and he knows how to use his fists --

     -- but he's slow, too slow.

     MAVERICK

     ducking the blow, coming up with a punch of his own that
     lands on the side of the jaw and the guy staggers back and
     down.

     THE KID

     watching and probably he's never seen anything like this, one
     guy attacking four.

     THE ANGEL

     and for just a moment now, as he stares out almost in
     disbelief, there's something new behind his eyes: Fear.

     MAVERICK

     leaving his feet, kicking out with both legs at the third
     guy, crunching him in the chest, sending him careening back,
     cartwheeling to earth.

     LEAD GUY

     diving at Maverick from behind, and for a moment he's got
     him, his arms tight around Maverick.

     and the instant this happens, he lets his body go totally
     limp so the Lead Guy is left having to hold him up, and he
     hadn't expected this and as Maverick sags --


     LEAD GUY

     stunned as suddenly Maverick stiffens, tosses the Lead Guy
     over his head and through the air where he lands, hard.

     moving back on the First Guy, the one he creamed the air out
     of and as he approaches, the First Guy turns, runs.

     LEAD GUY

     on his feet running too.

     MAVERICK

     watching as all four take off into the night. Maverick picks
     up his gun belt, straps it on as he heads back toward the
     frontier.


     INT. CRYSTAL PALACE - MAVERICK - NIGHT

     enters. He seems remarkably calm, considering what he's just
     done. Breathing heavily, sure, a little dusty, absolutely,
     but no more.

     Annabelle hurries to him.

                          ANNABELLE
               That was the most amazing thing.

     -- he touches his beautiful ruffled lace shirt --

     A look of blind fury is there.

     THE ANGEL

     watching, as Maverick storms toward him.

                          MAVERICK
               All right -- my shirt's damaged,
               what the hell else bad can happen?

               -- Didn't you call him a gutless
               coward? -- I'm pretty sure that was
               it.

                          THE ANGEL
                    (sweating)
               -- never said such a thing --
               gutless cheat, yes, but I would
               never call a man a coward --
                    (hopefully)
               -- and I was teasing.

     Maverick studies the bigger man for a moment.

     amiably --

     Then,

               Let's play poker.


     EXT./INT. CRYSTAL PALACE - MAVERICK'S ROOM & BALCONY -

     Maverick in his room, still in his gambling attire. He is
     finishing counting his considerable cash winnings as a KNOCK
     comes on his door.

     Who is it?

                          ANNABELLE (O.S.)
               Annabelle Bransford.


     DOOR

     as he opens it and there she is, stunning as ever, stand-ing
     in the hallway. She looks up at him nervously. You can almost
     feel her Southern heart pounding.

                          ANNABELLE
               I... I shouldn't be doing this.

                          MAVERICK
               You're just standing in the
               hallway, Mrs. Bransford -- I think
               that's still legal in this state.


     ANNABELLE MOVING QUICKLY INTO HIS ROOM.
     She closes the door.

                          ANNABELLE
               If only I weren't married --

     And with that she goes into his arms, kisses him passion-
     ately -- as they break.

                          ANNABELLE (CONT’D)
               -- I couldn't help myself. My very
               being cried out for me to hold you.

                          MAVERICK
               Stop by anytime.


     CLOSEUP - ANNABELLE

     Eyes so bright.

                          ANNABELLE
               We'll likely never see each other
               again so it's safe for me to tell
               you -- you're the most blindingly
               attractive man I've ever seen.
                    (her cheek brushes his)
               And now good-bye.

     She takes a step toward the door.

     MAVERICK

     He is a healthy young man and this is a woman of passion and
     beauty. He reaches out, gently takes her hand, speaks soft,
     his voice husky.

                          MAVERICK
               ... Annabelle...?


     ANNABELLE

     all but trembling.

     MAVERICK
     There is a long pause.
     Then --

     He kisses her forehead.

                          MAVERICK
               How can I go on without my wallet?
               ... if you don't give me back my
               money, I'll have your ass thrown in
               jail. Hand it over.


     ANNABELLE

     Shocked.

     MAVERICK
     Hurt.

     He snaps his fingers sharply.

     ANNABELLE

     as she realizes this.
     He isn't kidding around.

                                                      ANNABELLE
     Damn.

     And with that, she takes the wallet she's heisted from his
     coat, slaps it angrily into his hand. He puts it back into
     his pocket.

                          MAVERICK
               Don't get mad at me -- I can't help
               it you're a miserable thief.

                          ANNABELLE
               I'm a good thief, mister -- I'm
               just having a run of bad luck.

                          MAVERICK
               I know about those --
                    (studies her)
               -- where you from? Your accent
               could use a little work too.

                    (still using the accent)
               Most men enjoy my southern accent.

                          MAVERICK
               I love it. And there isn't a Mister
               Bransford, is there?

                          ANNABELLE
               No there isn't. And never will be,
               thank you very much.
                    (looks at him)
               What happens now?
                    (as he shrugs)
               You're not going to turn me in?

                          MAVERICK
               I should, I'm a law abiding
               citizen, but what the hell. I got
               my money back. Let's call it
               square.

                          ANNABELLE
               You're going to let me go?

                          MAVERICK
               I'm just having mercy on the
               Sheriff, is all.

                    (crossing to the door and
                     slamming it as he nods, a

               Damn.

                                                       MAVERICK
     What?

                          ANNABELLE
               You -- you irritate me -- you're
               just so...
                    (looking for the word)
               ... likeable.

                          MAVERICK
               I'll work on that.

                          ANNABELLE
               There you go doing it again. Being
               likeable. You know what I think? --
               if we'd met under different
               circumstances, we'd have just hated
               each other. There is not Mrs.
               Maverick, is there?

                          MAVERICK
               I'm sure I would have remembered.

                          ANNABELLE
               See? I can be likeable too.
                    (quickly now, she comes
                     into his arms)
               I wish we'd never met. Good-bye.

                                                       MAVERICK
     Good-bye.

     A quick embrace, a kiss on the cheek.

     goes to the door.

     MAVERICK

     Touched.

     Alone now, he reaches into his pocket for his money, it isn't
     there --

     -- she's robbed him again --
     They separate.

     She

                          MAVERICK
               Son-of-a-bitch.

     -- he breaks out laughing -- opens door, looks and takes off.


     INT. CRYSTAL PALACE - ANNABELLE'S ROOM & BALCONY - NIGHT 19

     Annabelle, in her room, hurriedly finishing packing. She
     takes her suitcase, goes to the window, opens it, steps out
     onto the fire escape. It's clumsy going.

                          MAVERICK (O.S.)
               Can I be of help?


     EXT. ANNABELLE'S BALCONY - NIGHT

     She slaps him.

               You've got to admit, I was better
               the second time.

                          MAVERICK
               Not just better -- good. No, no.
               Not just good... very good.

                                                      ANNABELLE
     Thank you.

                          MAVERICK (CONT’D)
               Now it's time for you to do
               something I want.

                          ANNABELLE
               Don't you dare. I'm a lady. Not in
               a million years... not if I was
               100. Not if you were 100.

                          MAVERICK
               Shut up, lady. I don't want to go
               to bed with you.

                                                      ANNABELLE
     Why not?

                          MAVERICK (CONT’D)
               Why not?... I'd be too frightened -
               - What if I dozed off? God knows
               what parts of me you'd steal. I'd
               wake up with things missing.
                    (indicating his smudged
                     shirt)
               But obviously I can't clean this,
               and obviously you must know how to.
               The laundry is closed and I'm
               leaving early, and you do owe me.
               Take it easy on the starch.

     Annabelle smiles as he takes off his shirt, her Southern
     accent back again.

                          ANNABELLE
               If I can't touch you, I can touch
               your shirt... and dream.

                          MAVERICK

     She nods yes and begins back in -- Maverick pushes and she
     pushes plops back inside. He begins to walk --
     remembers and comes back -- she hands him the wallet.

     EXT. MAIN STREET - MORNING (NEXT DAY)

     as Maverick, dressed for travel, heads for the bank.

     He's in a good mood and why not? -- it's a gorgeous day.


     BANK

     Small. Quiet. Several horses tied outside.
     23 DOOR OF BANK PRESIDENT, MATTHEW WICKER

     Maverick is with an ELDERLY CLERK who points to the door,
     leaves. As soon as Maverick is alone, he draws his gun,
     bursts into the office.

     WICKER

     stunned, just stares.

     MAVERICK

     cocks his gun, gestures for Wicker to raise his hands.

     WICKER

     a distinguished looking man, slowly rises, his hands going
     into the air.

                          WICKER
                    (suddenly speaking in a
                     high pitched voice, like
                     a heroine in a melodrama)
               Oh no, please do not hurt me,
               please, I'm just a frail flower,
               have mercy --

     He is stopped as the Elderly Clerk looks in from the open
     door.

                                                  ELDERLY CLERK
     Robbery --

                          WICKER (CONT’D)
                    (closing the door)
               No -- no, it's not a robbery,
               that's just Maverick saying hello.
                    (to Maverick)
               C'mere, you silly son of a bitch.

     He embraces Maverick.

               Hey, Matty, everything going good?

               Couldn't be worse.
                    (dead honest)
               Bret, I owe you a thousand dollars,
               I've got maybe a hundred.
                    (takes out a bill)
               I never welched on a debt in my
               life. Give me to the end of the
               year.

                          MAVERICK
               I need it now.

                          WICKER
               It's that poker championship, I
               knew it -- what's the entry fee,
               twenty five thousand?

     Maverick nods.

                          WICKER (CONT’D)
               Jesus, kid, I'm sorry.

                          MAVERICK
               Porkchop Slim owed me too, but he
               died. Widow used my thousand for
               the funeral.

                          WICKER
               I heard he was cremated.

                          MAVERICK
               The Widow Porkchop conned me?
                    (stunned)
               What is it with people nowadays?

                          WICKER
               I feel the same way -- it's hard to
               trust anybody.

     They are by the door.
     Wicker opens it --

     -- and a masked man is pointing a gun at them.

                          WICKER (CONT’D)
               My God, there is a robbery.

     The masked man grabs Maverick's hundred, frisks Wicker, takes
     a huge wad of bills from his inside pocket.

     blind.

     The four guys he clobbered the night before are waiting.

     They look more menacing in the daylight.

     Maverick sees them, cuts into an alley by the bank.

     Coughing, half

     The four guys are right behind him.

     Maverick moves quickly into shadow.

     The four guys spread out, start to surround him.

     Thanks

               Easy? Damn. Those were my best
               shots.
                    (beat)

     They all AD LIB about money, the deal, etc.

     Maverick in his room. He has finished packing and draws a
     card from a deck on the dresser. The 8 of Clubs. He reacts
     badly to this turn of luck and moves to the bed.

     His gambling shirt is on his bed. He picks it up gently,
     takes the tissue off.

     Except... she's shrunk the shit out of it.

     watching as Maverick reaches her.
     This goes snappily.

                          MAVERICK
               You did this on purpose!

                          ANNABELLE
               You bet I did.

                          MAVERICK
               This was my lucky shirt.

                    (spinning her around,
                     holding her shoulders)
               My underwear comes from New York,
               where the hell you think that shirt
               was made? Paris, France, lady --
               you think they sell them in the dry
               goods store?

                          ANNABELLE
               Why don't you try the kiddies'
               department --

     Maverick grabs for Annabelle and she grabs him.

     And now comes a new male voice, deep and powerful.

                          MAN (O.S.)
               Remove your hands from the lady.

     As Maverick turns --

     JUST AN INCREDIBLE-LOOKING MAN

     -- we'll find out soon enough his name is ZANE COOPER.

     He is raw-boned, blue-eyed, muscle and sinew; rugged as they
     come. There is also something about him we don't know yet but
     we will: Coop is so good, so fucking honorable, he seems like
     someone out of another era --

     -- which in point of fact, he is. Coop is the western hero
     who dominated movies for most of this century. In other
     words, we are looking at John Wayne or Gary Cooper.

     Not only has he never done anything bad, the thought of doing
     anything bad has never crossed his mind.

                     from her shoulders)

               a hero arrives.

               This silly-looking creature is

               I don't know what this ruffian
               would have done to me if it had
               just been the two of us alone on

               I hope you can relax and enjoy the

                     coach)
               Here's my feeling -- if there
               wern't any women, we wouldn't be
               here.

                          MAVERICK
               What kind of sense does that make?
               If there weren't any men, we
               wouldn't be here either.


     COOP

     He studies Maverick a moment.
     Then -- very flat --

                          COOP
               Are you mocking me?

                          MAVERICK
               Before I answer, does it bother
               you?

                          COOP
               I can get ruffled.

                          MAVERICK
               We don't want you ruffled. Why
               don't we just say I was agreeing
               with you in a totally unusual way.

     As they study each other -- Annabelle leans out of the coach.

     A corpse walks up. Obviously, not an actual corpse, just the
     most SICKLY-LOOKING MAN you ever saw. He heads for the stage.

     Maverick opens the door for him.

                          SICKLY-LOOKING MAN
                    (pointing up to the front)

               Help me up, son, or we'll never get
               a move on.

     Maverick jumps nimbly up to the seat, starts to pull the
     driver up -- it isn't easy, but the old guy gets there.

     As they whisper and their laughter builds --


     THE ANGEL

     He takes his second drink which is now poured, drops it down
     the hatch, and walks over to the Cowboys.

                          LEAD COWBOY
               Heavens to Betsy, no.

     Now they all four laugh again.

                          THE ANGEL
               I want to know the joke.

     It's next afternoon.
     Both men doze.

     EXT. DESOLATE COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

     Clearly, the coach is out of control as it is flying down the

     They are going like hell across very rough country.

     Maverick and Coop, both sticking their heads out the window,
     shouting at the driver.

     The driver.
     Slumped in his seat.
     Limp. Eyes closed.

     INT. STAGECOACH - DAY

     Inside the coach.
     Coop is getting ready for action.

                          COOP
                    (to Maverick)
               Go on up there and stop the stage -
               -

                          MAVERICK
               -- I'm not sure I want to do that -
               -

                          COOP
               -- the wheel is coming loose! -- if
               it falls off, we're all of us dead
               -- I'll climb out and secure it,
               you handle the driver -- let's go -
               -


     MAVERICK

     He nods, reaches out for the nearest door, shoves it open and
     --


     EXT. STAGECOACH - DAY

     Maverick, moving out the door -- and this is the begin-ning
     of a really hairy journey.

     TERRAIN

     flying by.

     MAVERICK
     Bumpy and dusty and

     holding on to the side of the stage. It's not a matter here
     of him falling off -- he's too powerful and athletic for that
     -- but he's blinded by the dust and is trying like hell to
     get his bearings. Plus, this is not anyone's idea of comfort.

     TERRAIN

     A huge rut --

     MAVERICK

     flying half off the stage, managing to hold on, pull him-self
     back to where he was and now, coughing and still un-able to
     see a lot, he begins his climb.


     RAILING

     around the roof as he grabs hold, first with one hand, then
     with the other and --

     HORSES

     pounding along -- as they hit another huge rut --

     MAVERICK

     being flipped up and onto the roof, where he lands hard, but
     still manages to keep hold of the railing.


     INT. STAGECOACH - DAY

     Coop sits as calmly and comfortably as possible, listen-ing
     to the sounds of Maverick's efforts from above.

     Annabelle is confused, and just a bit frightened.

                          ANNABELLE
               You said we'd die if the wheel came
               off.

                          COOP
               Rest easy, Miss Annabelle, wheel is
               just fine.

                          ANNABELLE
                    (it's getting scarier --
                     she reaches for him)
               For protection, you don't mind?

                          COOP
                    (shyly)
               Proud as a peacock.

                          ANNABELLE
                    (glancing up as more
                     sounds come from the
                     roof)
               You don't think he'll kill you?

                          COOP
                    (nah)
               In the long run, the lad will thank
               me in his prayers.

     As he continues to hold the frightened Annabelle --

     The terrain is getting bumpier --

     -- and this is where it starts to get tricky -- he inches
     forward across the luggage toward where the driver is --

     -- except there's a difference in level. The driver is
     several feet below and getting down has to be timed just
     right because if you hit a bump when you're trying to get off
     the roof -- not a good thing.


     DRIVER

     He lies sprawled and motionless on the seat. The reins are
     still in his hands -- but loose -- he has no control over the
     animals.

     Coop, peering out the window toward the front where Maverick
     is. He starts to chuckle.

                     a sweet memory)

               There's a knack to doing it.
                    (as she sits alongside him
                     now)
               More protection?
                    (as she nods)
               Thought so.

     As she holds him tight --


     EXT. STAGECOACH

     Maverick, managing to grab the driver, who doesn't look any
     worse than when we first met him except now he is dead. Plus,
     being dead, he's not grabbing hold of any-thing that's of any
     use to Maverick, so his body begins sliding along the seat
     and --

     MAVERICK

     off the stage now and getting, he realizes, very close to
     shit creek --

     -- he makes a desperate lunge, just manages to grab hold of
     the railing that circles the driver's seat as we --

     DEAD DRIVER

     sliding along, still holding the reins, his body coming
     closer and closer to Maverick and --

     MAVERICK

     letting go of the dead driver, grabbing the rail with both
     hands, forcing himself up to the seat just as the dead driver
     starts to fall off it --

     -- but not before Maverick can grab him, pull him back on so
     now they're both on the driver's seat, Maverick reach-ing for
     the reins, which brings the dead driver's arms around his
     neck.

     MAVERICK

     doing his best to ignore the corpse and take control of the
     reins --

     -- which at last, thank God, he does --

     -- and laying the corpse onto the seat he takes the reins,
     one in each of his powerful hands --

     INT. STAGECOACH - DAY

     Coop and Annabelle, getting bounced all the hell around.

                          ANNABELLE
               You don't think it might be nice to
               go out there and help him?

                          COOP
               I could do that, absolutely -- but
               after he's worked so hard, he might
               resent it. Something tells me that
               inside that buffoon, there's a real
               human being trying to get out.

                          ANNABELLE
               You think it's possible.

     The corpse, lying on the seat, bumping up and down and --

     MAVERICK

     steaming mad now -- he takes the reins again, really pulls on

     Stopped. Maverick, wiped out, taking a deep breath as he sits
     for a moment on the driver's seat.

     COOP AND ANNABELLE

     getting out of the stage.

     MAVERICK

     still bleary from what he's been through.

     attention, he jumps to the ground --

     Without paying

     -- which is a mistake --

     -- he should have been paying attention --

     -- because the stage has been halted on the lip of a three
     thousand-foot cliff.

     MAVERICK

     landing, losing his balance --

     -- the cliff is very sheer --

     -- he realizes his situation now, begins waving his arms,
     trying to get balance as we --

     COOP AND ANNABELLE

     She is horrified by what could happen.

     a hand to Maverick --

     -- only he doesn't.

     MAVERICK
     He just stands there, idly watching

     and he is not a happy camper --

     curious as to just what's going to happen.

     windmilling in desperation -- and for a moment it looks like
     he's not going to make it --

     -- but finally he does, pitching forward safely to the
     ground.

                          COOP

     He gets to his feet.

     the stage.

     Still out of breath, he looks at

               What's with the wheel?

                          COOP
               Turns out I was wrong -- wheel was
               fine all along.

               you feel a whole lot better about
               yourself now that you've done
               something brave?


     MAVERICK

     There is a pause.
     Then, smiling amiably back at Coop --

                          MAVERICK
               Oh, I get it, this was for my

               Look at him -- bursting with pride.

     Coop looks at him -- as Maverick does his lightning draw,
     cocks his pistol, aims it at Coop's head -- he could almost
     shoot.

                          MAVERICK (CONT’D)
               Try not to help me again!

     From that --


     EXT. GRAVESITE - AFTERNOON

     A freshly covered-over grave. Maverick and Coop are cov-ered
     with sweat from the digging. Annabelle is with them.

     It's later in the afternoon now.

                          COOP
               I suppose somebody ought to say
               something nice about the deceased.

                          ANNABELLE
               How do we know he was nice? We
               don't know anything about him. All
               he had in his wallet was the names
               of some whorehouses.

     And now, O.S., the sound Maverick's voice in song --

     MAVERICK

     who has started into "Amazing Grace" --

     -- and the shocker is this: Not that the song is gor-geous,
     it's one of the most beautiful songs ever writ-ten -- no, the
     stunner is that Maverick can really sing.

     A strong, firm voice echoing out over the rough land.

                          MAVERICK
               'Amazing Grace How sweet the
               sound...'

     -- and now, surprisingly, Coop joins in. And here's something
     else you didn't expect: He can sing too.

                    (in harmony)

     And now Annabelle, touched by what's happening, joins them,
     her voice high and lovely.

                          ANNABELLE/COOP/MAVERICK (CONT’D)
               '... I once was lost But now I'm
               found...'

     And now, as they come to the end of the first verse,
     Annabelle sings different words from the men. She realizes
     her mistake, stops, and listens to them.

                          COOP/MAVERICK (CONT’D)
               '... was bound...'

                          ANNABELLE
               '... was blind...'

     Here she stops, lets them sing in harmony the last line.

                          COOP/MAVERICK
               '... but now I'm free...'

                          COOP/MAVERICK/ANNABELLE (CONT’D)
               'Twas grace that taught my heart to
               fear, And grace my fears relieved,
               How precious did that grace appear,
               The hour I first believed...'
               'Through many dangers,
               toils and snares,
               I have already come. Tis Grace hath
               brought me safe
               thus far.
               And Grace will lead me home.'

     They all stand close together as the ECHO OF the SONG DIES.
     Then --

     SEVERAL COVERED WAGONS

     Just the most pathetic sight. Filled with widows and children
     in tears. Several wounded men. Two of the wagons are
     smoldering and burned.

     Coop vaults to the ground, hurries to the wagons as Maverick
     brings the stagecoach to a halt.

     on the coach, watching. Annabelle silently gets out a flask,
     takes a pull of whisky, offers some to Maverick.

     flask away.

     There is dead silence for a beat before Maverick and

     None of the words are intelligable.

     EXT. TRACKING AREA #1 - DAY

     Maverick sneaks through the brush with Annabelle at his side.
     Coop follows a step or two behind leading the horses. He
     keeps his eyes pealed as they track.

                          MAVERICK
               These ponies have been shod.
               Indians don't shoe their horses.

                          ANNABELLE
               They could have been stolen. What's
               with you and Indians anyway?

                          MAVERICK
               Yeah, you're right. They're just a
               bunch of theives and savages. Don't
               get me wrong. I mean we've given
               them smallpox blankets. I figure
               they deserved it for being on our
               land before we got here. What are
               you doing here anyway?

                          ANNABELLE
               I'm your partner. Fifty-fifty.

                          COOP
                    (nobly)
               Sounds like fifty-fifty to me.

                          MAVERICK
               And what are you tagging along for?
               You want fifty percent too?

                          COOP
               I just want to see those fine
               ladies get their money back.

     Maverick grumbles to himself and ducks under a low branch.
     Annabelle pushes it aside, snapping it back into Coop's face.
     He blinks a couple of times then moves stoically forward.

                          MAVERICK
                    (turning to Annabelle)
               I don't split my bounty with
               anybody.

                          ANNABELLE
               Well, I suppose sixty/forty would
               be acceptable if you're going to be
               recalcitrant...

     Maverick and Coop do a double take on this.

                                                       MAVERICK
     'Re' -- what?

                          ANNABELLE (CONT’D)
                    (with condescention)

                    (dumbfounded)
               Sixty/forty! What are you gonna do
               for forty percent?

                          ANNABELLE
                    (lady-like)
               I'm going to help.

     At that moment Annabelle loses her footing on the trail and
     lurches forward. She grabs onto Maverick, clutching onto his
     gunbelt, as she tries to keep her balance.

     Annabelle FIRES ONE ROUND into the ground (with his gun still
     in his holster). Maverick turns and looks at her in
     amazement.

                          ANNABELLE (CONT’D)
               Seventy/thirty?

     That's all it is, just dirt.

     still watching it. Then he rises, whistles for his horse,
     gracefully mounts.

     And rides very slowly forward.

     If it isn't clear by now, it should be:

     lowing something.

     Who knows? Maybe he was an Indian Scout after all. In any
     case, this much is clear: the man has instincts other people

     Maverick, riding along, watching the terrain. The sound of a
     WATERFALL GETS LOUDER as he approaches it.

     -- he stops --

     -- listens --

     -- no question, he's hearing something, it is FAINT MUSIC.

     He urges his horse forward, very slowly.

     He quickly reins in, dismounts, moves a few steps away,
     studying. Then he gives an all but inaudible WHISTLE.

               Not a thing. Personally I think
               we've spoiled them from the
               beginning. We've poisoned them,
               infected them, killed them -- but I
               say it's their fault for being on
               our land before we got here.

     His back has been to her but it's clear to him she's talking
     about him.

     He turns --

     EXT. CAMPFIRE VICINITY - NIGHT

     The three walking in dead silence.

     ANNABELLE

     as her boot brushes a small stone, sending it skittering.

     MAVERICK AND COOP

     Both of them whirling, glaring at her.

     ANNABELLE

     She mouths "Sorry."

     Now --
     They move on in silence again.

     EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT

     The six men we saw before. Under blankets, some snoring, some
     not. Whiskey bottles on the ground. Their six horses tied
     nearby.

     There is the remains of a fire. It's not as high as it was,
     but it's still burning, giving off, along with the moon, the
     only light.

     PULL BACK to reveal --

     Maverick, Coop and Annabelle, on their haunches.

     Maverick and Coop have pulled back bushes, giving them room
     to see. This next is whispered and fast.

               It could be just a bunch of drunken
               cowboys fooling around.

               the warpaint... dressed up like
               Indians.

               Nothing? What proof do you need?
               The music box, your sweetheart's
               wedding dress. Mary Margaret.

                          COOP
               Margaret Mary. And what do you mean
               sweetheart? She's not my

               We can bring 'em in easy, we can

               I've only got one gun. That's only
               six bullets. They have six guns, so
               that's thirty-six bullets and they
               probably have two each so that's
               seventy-two bullets, so -- and
               rifles...

                     before)
               You are babbling. Don't worry --
               they're probably drunk and Coop
               brought in nine dead sober.

                          MAVERICK
               Coop's always dead sober --

     Both of them clapping a hand on her mouth as we... SIX MEN

     One of them has heard something -- he goes up on one elbow,
     looks around. He reaches under his blanket for a moment,
     brings it back out -- he holds a gun.

               What do you mean? I shot the right

     Panic among those down below.
     Coop turns to Maverick.

                          COOP
               What's he saying?

                    (nervous)
               We've committed a terrible sin --

               We didn't know it was sacred --

               If someone passes the Indian
               Bravery test, he won't kill the

               is it, can I see it?

     On that --

     Maverick's saddlebag as he goes to it, opens it, takes out
     his leather drawstring bag --

     -- Joseph is excited watching.

     Maverick opens the bag --

                                                         JOSEPH
     Ha ha.

     -- after which he goes into shock -- the bag is filled with
     rolled-up Sears catalog paper. (Lots of AD LIBS.)

                          MAVERICK
               That rotten Annabelle --
                    (big)
               -- how could she rob me when I was
               going to face my doom? I could
               shoot her. -- I will.
                    (drops the now-empty bag -
                     - deep gloom has
                     descended)
               I'm never gonna make it to that
               tournament... I'm a dead man.

                          JOSEPH

     I'm a dead man.


     JOSEPH

     And now the thing you least expect:
     a smile.

                          JOSEPH
               No, you really are a dead man.
               Listen to me...

     EXT. MEADOW/STREAM - JOSEPH - NEXT AFTERNOON

     riding his magnificent horse at full gallop through a stream.
     A couple of braves alongside him.

     PULL BACK to reveal...

     A number of tents all of them surrounding something we hadn't
     expected to see: a large custom wagon (an 1870 motor home).

     It rests in the middle of a meadow.


     EXT. ARCHDUKE'S MOTORHOME - DAY

     Near the wagon as Joseph arrives. It is ornate, filled with
     artwork of all kinds, clearly Russian in origin.

     An ARTIST, VILMOS, is painting. The Archduke comes out.

                          ARCHDUKE
               Where's the waterfall?

                          VILMOS
               I make nature more beautiful.

     He's the kind of guy if he wasn't so rich and powerful, you'd
     want to clobber. Spoiled beyond belief, the pro-duct of
     decades of inbreeding, he is reminiscent of Peter Ustinov in
     Quo Vadis when he played Nero.

                          JOSEPH

               Five... thousand dollars.

               Would we have to tie him up?

     Now, as the Archduke starts to get excited --


     EXT. BURNED-OUT FOREST - AFTERNOON

     Later in the afternoon.

     Maverick, magnificently painted to look like an Indian,
     stands alone. From a distance, in point of fact, he actually
     looks like an Indian. Now, at the sound of horses, he bends

               No -- Indian law say death be
               private. You wait here.

     The Archduke nods. Joseph goes to look for Maverick.

     We see Maverick with all his Indian makeup on.

               dollars.

               Worth the risk. Okay.
     Let's go.

                          MAVERICK (CONT’D)
               250? I'm taking all the risk. What
               do you need 250 for?

     Evening now. Fires all over.

               Don't insult me by counting it.

                          MAVERICK
               Sorry, but lately my friends have
               been stiffing me.

                          JOSEPH
                    (an arm around Maverick)
               What are friends for...?

     EXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - MORNING
     Maverick rides away from Village -- crosses stream.


     EXT. TRAIL - DAY


     MAVERICK, RIDING ALONG A TRAIL GOING THE OPPOSITE DIREC-TION
     AS WHEN HE LEFT.

                          TURNING IN TRAIL
               Rocks on either side.

     As he takes it he sees a...

     RIDERLESS HORSE


     THE RIDER, FACE DOWN, LIES MOANING IN DEEP PAIN. HIS BODY IS
     AT A FUNNY ANGLE -- LEGS COULD BE BROKEN.


     MAVERICK REINING IN, DISMOUNTING.

                                                       MAVERICK
     Hang on.

                          GUY ON GROUND
               Groaning is louder. MAVERICK


     KNEELING, GENTLY TURNING THE GUY OVER. CLOSEUP - GUY HE'S THE
     FIRST PERSON WE SAW IN THE MOVIE, THE GUY WITH THE WANDERING
     EYE WHO WITNESSED THE HANGING. MAVERICK


     HAS NO IDEA WHO THE GUY IS. WANDERING EYE
     He whispers.

     ANGEL AND GUY WITH BURNED FACE

     appearing behind him and while he is unaware, burned face
     grabs his gun from its holster while Angel delivers a vicious
     kick to the back of the head.

     MAVERICK

     falling to the ground, stunned, in sudden pain.

     starts to rise --

     He

     -- but too late --

     -- Angel delivers another terrible kick -- this one flush in
     the stomach. Maverick gasps.

     ANGEL

     Another kick into the stomach. This one harder.

     Maverick is beginning to go pale. Impossible to breathe now.

                                                          ANGEL
     Should have paid your cowhands

     |more, Maverick.
     (and now kicks Maverick brutally in the neck -- )
     Lucky for you I'm not the kind who minds being made a fool
     of.

     As he gestures for others to join him in beating the hell out
     of Maverick --

                                                          ANGEL
     I never would have let you make
     the poker game -- but before you
     done what you done, I might have
     let you live.

     MAVERICK

     trying to retaliate as best as he can --

     -- but the attack was too sudden, too vicious --

     -- and as the beating continues --


     EXT. HANGING TREE - DAY
     The sky.

                                                       THUNDER.

     -- Maverick's hanging.
     The rattlers are moving out of the burlap sack.
     They wriggle closer to Maverick on his horse.
     His horse is a rock.
     Maverick struggles to free himself harder than ever, all he's
     got and more and
     The rattlers will not stop -- will -- not -- stop --
     The horse sees the rattlers now --
     -- and doesn't budge.
     Maverick in desperation increases his efforts.
     THUNDERCLAPS.
     Lightning.
     The rattlers start to curl.
     Totally without warning, Maverick's horse bolts.
     Maverick's body drops into space.
     He hangs helpless in mid-air.
     The rattlers continue to curl.
     Maverick fights somehow to free his neck from the noose --
     -- trying somehow to find a way to survive.
     No good.
     Not enough breath.
     His body's struggling becomes more feeble.
     Then more feeble still.
     He is a strong and powerful man but in the last hours he has
     been in gunfights, been beaten half to death --
     -- his energy is going.
     Going.
     Almost gone now.

     His body hangs motionless in space.

     Nothing left.

     As his eyes start to close --


     EXT. HANGING TREE - DAY

     -- the LOUDEST THUNDERCLAP of all.

     -- and the whole goddam branch Maverick is hanging from is
     ripped from the tree, and as it falls hard to the ground,
     Maverick with it --

     -- the rattlers are all around him.

     in their midst.

     Deafening --

     He's landed stunned

     It's impossible to tell which one of them will strike first.
     Now --

     TWO GNARLED HANDS

     That's all we see at first, just the hands. One of them grabs
     the burlap sack, the other starts scooping up the rattlers,
     putting them back inside.

     No fear of consequences. One-two-three-four-five-six, and the
     rattlers are gone from view. And once they are --

     PULL BACK to reveal...

     the MAGICIAN, for that, we will learn, is the name of the
     woman we are looking at.

     Little old woman, more precisely.

     Weird-looking little old woman, more precisely still. She is
     dressed in clothing that neither fits nor matches.

     When she talks, she talks very loudly. Clearly she doesn't
     get a lot of company. Right now she isn't talking at all,
     just staring at Maverick's still body.

     Mounted on her strange little cart is the biggest buffalo gun
     you ever saw. It is what blasted the tree branch to the
     ground. And smoke still drifts out of the barrel and hangs in
     the air.

     Now she takes a foot, pushes Maverick over so he's on his
     back.

     Next she aims the huge weapon at Maverick's heart.

               I'm a gonna kill you.


     MAVERICK

     Barely able to speak. Still, this latest piece of news is not
     so much upsetting as it is strange.

                          MAVERICK
                    (whispered)
               ... if you're going to do that...
               why didn't you just let me hang...?


     THE MAGICIAN

     coming closer.

                          THE MAGICIAN
               'Cuz then you wouldn't have know'd
               your crime.

                          MAVERICK
                    (blinking up)
               ... who are you...? And what's my
               crime...?

                          THE MAGICIAN

                    (a bit ticked)
               -- never mind who I am -- it don't
               matter a whit who I am --
               -- how dare you ask who I am? --
               it's none of your business who I am
               -- the subject under discussion is
               you and your crime --
                    (bigger)
               -- the crime you're gonna die for -
               -

               -- the crime that's gonna condemn
               you to hell is this:
                    (roaring)
               You stole my rattlesnakes.


     MAVERICK

     He's just in terrible shape but he didn't think he was going
     mad.

                          MAVERICK
               ... do I look like a rattlesnake
               thief?

                          THE MAGICIAN
                    (studies Maverick a long
                     while, the huge gun still
                     aimed. Finally she nods)
               That's exactly what you look like.

                          MAVERICK
               You're wrong -- I play cards.

                          THE MAGICIAN
                    (shakes her head)
               A gambler? Not in that shirt.


     MAVERICK

     He closes his eyes, tries to laugh --

     -- but he can't. Not just because he hasn't the strength but
     because he is far beyond exhaustion. His body begins to
     shake, as if with fever. HOLD ON Maverick. Now --


     INT. MAGICIAN'S CABIN - CLOSEUP - BIG RATTLESNAKE - DAY

     PULL BACK to reveal...

     the Magician's cabin.

     he has been ill.

     The rattler begins to slither up a leg of the cot on which he
     lies.

     THE MAGICIAN

     sitting across the room in a rocking chair.
     Maverick lies on a cot.

     Clearly,

                          THE MAGICIAN
                    (as if to a dog)
               Henry, you get offa there this
               minute!


     RATTLER

     It knows who's boss. It slithers down the leg of the cot,
     scots across the room.


     ROOM

     Just as strangely furnished as the Magician is strangely
     dressed.

     It's not a small room at all. And on the walls are some
     beautiful oil paintings. Some gorgeous handmade quilts.
     Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be
     found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library

     On the floor -- a large and obviously expensive oriental rug.

     In the corner -- several huge bags.

     Plus one more thing: The whole room is filled with
     rattlesnakes of varying shapes and sizes.


     MAVERICK EYES SLOWLY OPENING. HE MANAGES TO LIFT HIS HEAD,
     TAKE IN HIS SURROUNDINGS.

                          MAVERICK
               ... this hell...?

                          THE MAGICIAN
               No, ya fool, it's my home -- I
               decided you was too dumb to steal
               my babies.

                          MAVERICK
               How long I been sick? What day is
               it?

                          THE MAGICIAN
               Son, I lost track of what year it
               was years ago. Couple days, maybe,
               maybe more'na couple.
                    (glances at blue bottles
                     over bed)
               I wouldn't if I was you.

                          MAVERICK
                    (no clue)
               Say again?

                          THE MAGICIAN
               You was thinking of stealing my
               bottles -- don't deny it, the whole
               world wants my bottles, ain't a
               bottle collection in a thousand
               miles equal to mine and I'm telling
               you true, you so much as touch one,
               I'll have you fanged to death.
                    (beat)
               You was almost hung.

                          MAVERICK
               I was there, I remember.

               That's what got you off your feed,
               rest a little, you'll be fine.

     Gets up, comes over, looks down at Maverick. Maverick's eyes
     are closed again before the sentence is finished.

     Now --


     INT. THE MAGICIAN'S CABIN - TWILIGHT

     The Magician cooking at the stove in another corner of her
     home.

     MAVERICK

     He sits in a chair at a small wooden table with two chairs. A
     thick blanket is thrown across his shoulders.

     The Magician brings him a plate of food. Or at least a plate
     of something. Maverick looks at it suspiciously.

                          MAVERICK
               What do you call this?

                          THE MAGICIAN
               It don't pay to ask too many
               questions.


     PLATE

     At least nothing looks alive.

     MAVERICK

     He takes a bite; that's enough.

                          THE MAGICIAN
               You'll wanna get your strength
               back.

     Maverick says nothing.

                          MAVERICK
               What do you call this?

                          THE MAGICIAN
               It's one of my specialties.

                          MAVERICK
                    (toys with it, doesn't
                     eat)

               I was not addressing you. Now shut
               up.
                    (quiet tone)
               What do you think... Henry?

               Henry thinks you deserve to be
               punished -- Henry thinks all people
               who are rude and insulting to me
               deserve to be punished --
                    (building)
               -- did you grow the food that made
               your meal? No. Did you cook the
               food that made your meal? No. Did
               you know it was something I was
               proud of? Yes. I told you it was a
               speciality but you decided, 'What
               does she know, she doesn't look
               like such a great chef to me, why
               should I eat her speciality?'
                    (roaring again)
               You should eat it because you're a
               guest in my house and I worked hard
               to please you -- now we'll try it
               again, you ask what it is and I say
               it's a speciality, now what do you
               say? I'll tell you what you say.
               You say 'Yum.' Can you handle that?

                                                       MAVERICK

     |Yum.
     (beat)
     Should I rub my tummy too?

                          THE MAGICIAN (CONT’D)
               Suddenly laughing.

                          THE MAGICIAN (CONT’D)
               Now that was funny.

     school.

                          THE MAGICIAN (CONT’D)
               I hate funny people.


     MAVERICK

     He starts to take small spoonfuls now.

     isn't in it --

     But his heart

                          THE MAGICIAN
               You'll want to get your strength
               back.


     MAVERICK

     And this is the first time we've ever seen him like this:
     He's down. The optimism, the good-hearted quality that has
     always been with him -- that's gone.

                          MAVERICK
               Right now, I don't know what I need
               it for. See, there's gonna be a
               poker championship -- twenty-five
               thousand entrance fee. Poker's what
               I've done all my life and I wanted
               to know how good I was. Once and
               for all.
                    (beat)
               Got robbed. What I had's probably
               been spent. Game may have started
               already for all I know.

                          THE MAGICIAN
               Lemme tell you something true --
               money ain't worth shit.


     CLOSEUP - MAVERICK

     Long pause.
     Then --

                          MAVERICK
               It wasn't the money... it was the
               knowing.

     HOLD ON Maverick.
     Then --


     INT/EXT. THE MAGICIAN'S CABIN - DAY

     There's a strange feel to it. It's sunny but there's THUNDER.
     Huge clouds scud across the horizon.

     Two chairs set up alongside a large tree stump.

     sits in one of them, staring at the sky.

     Maverick

     The ground around him is filled with rattlers, taking in the
     sunshine.


     THE MAGICIAN

     carrying a couple of the large bags we saw in a corner.

     They're heavy, causing a problem for her. She has a large
     pistol tucked into her belt. Maverick is unarmed.

     Maverick is starting to look like himself again. His problem
     is the rattlers. He eyes them suspiciously as The Magician
     walks toward him.

                          THE MAGICIAN
                    (spotting the look)
               Oh, don't worry none. They're sweet
               as pie --
                    (beat)
               -- least, of course, I tell them to
               bite.

                          MAVERICK
               But you wouldn't do that.

                          THE MAGICIAN
                    (means this)
               Do it in a fingersnap if people
               rile me.


     GROUND

     as she puts the bags down --

     -- a few RATTLERS HISS, slither out of the way.

     The Magician sits in the other chair.

                          THE MAGICIAN
               Been thinking about your finances.
                    (pointing to a bag)
               Guess what's in here?
                    (big)
               The answer to your troubles.

     BAG

     as she opens it, pours out its contents.

     It's shit -- worthless -- tin plates, cups, ladles.

                          THE MAGICIAN (CONT’D)
               Some of them's real old --
                    (pronounces this next
                     anti-ques)
               -- antiques.

                          MAVERICK
               I don't think the champion will
               accept --
                    (beat)
               -- even genuine anti-ques.

                          THE MAGICIAN
               There he goes again, right, Henry?

                          MAVERICK
               What'd I do this time?

                          THE MAGICIAN
               We're only on this earth to help
               each other -- when I say something
               wrong, you ought to help me -- you
               ought to say, 'I think it's
               pronounced antiques.' Do it.

                          MAVERICK
               I think it's pronounced 'antiques.'

                          THE MAGICIAN
               Well, isn't that interesting, thank
               you for the tip.

     And on that, she belts him hard on the ear, like a
     schoolmistress to a recalcitrant child. Maverick just looks
     at her.

                          THE MAGICIAN (CONT’D)
               I'm your hostess, ya fool, what
               right you got correcting me?

                          MAVERICK
               But you said --

                          THE MAGICIAN
               Never pay attention to what I say -
               -
                    (beat; taking the second
                     sack)
               -- now listen carefully --

     MAVERICK

     Shocked.

     THE MAGICIAN
     And we find out why as we:

     holding the other bag wide -- and it's stuffed with cash. The
     Magician grabs a handful, holds it out. It's tied up in a
     bundle.

                          THE MAGICIAN
               I got twenty-five times twenty-five
               thousand in here.
                    (slaps the money down on
                     the tree trunk)
               There's more'n your entrance fee
               right there. Counted it out last
               night.

     The two of them, the money and tree stump between them.

     And of course, the SNAKES HISSING contentedly on the ground.

                                                       MAVERICK
     Incredible.

                          THE MAGICIAN (CONT’D)
                    (shrugs)
               Nah -- I been a hermit here forty
               years -- this is rough country, lot
               of people die. When I find 'em I
               keep what looks valuable.
                    (picks up the bundle of
                     money, holds it out)
               Want it? No loan or nothing, I'd
               just give it to you. I'd like that.

     Maverick reaches for the money --

     -- The Magician pulls it back.

                          THE MAGICIAN (CONT’D)
                    (roaring)
               Now I ain't no fool -- I want
               something in return --

     CLOSEUP - THE MAGICIAN

                          THE MAGICIAN
               I want for you to do magic.


     MAVERICK

     Nothing makes sense.

     THE MAGICIAN

     tossing the money back and forth as she speaks.

                          THE MAGICIAN
               See, when I was little --
                    (pauses; then starts to
                     cackle)
               -- I am little, I meant when I was
               young -- yes I was once, a child --
               anyway, animals was always nearby,
               not dogs, not cats, different
               kinds, butterflies liked me, bees
               used to follow me around, and
               people thought I was magical but I
               wasn't, I just treated everything
               the way I wanted to be treated, if
               you're nice to bees, cordial and
               all, well, they like it, something
               most people don't realize 'cause
               most people don't take the time,
               where was I? --

                          MAVERICK
               I have no idea whatsoever --

                          THE MAGICIAN
                    (mutters a moment, then)
               Magic! It's inside you, somewhere
               it is, I know that.

                          MAVERICK
               You don't know a thing about me.

                          THE MAGICIAN
                    (roaring)
               I know what you was blabbing when
               you was sick!

                          MAVERICK
                    (can't remember)
               What did I say?

                          THE MAGICIAN
               You did magic with the ace of
               sapdes, I want to know about it.

                          MAVERICK
                    (shakes his head)
               That was personal.

                          THE MAGICIAN
               I really am interested!
                    (pistol is out -- but only
                     briefly; puts it back)
               Nah -- I saved you too often
               already to kill you now. But you
               owe me.

                          MAVERICK
               A long pause.

                    (soft)
               I guess I do.

                          THE MAGICIAN
               What was so personal about it?

                          MAVERICK
               My mother was dying and I wanted to
               please her before she left.
                    (remembering)
               I thought I had magic that day.
                    (beat)
               But I was wrong.

                          CLOSEUP - MAVERICK
               A reverie.

                          MAVERICK
               I had a way with cards, even when I
               was little -- she used to like me
               to do tricks.
                    (beat)
               And that last day -- I was doing
               the usual -- but then I felt I had
               to be special for -- I said I would
               close my eyes and cut her the ace
               of spades -- it was her favorite
               card. Whenever I'd ask her to think
               of a card, she always said 'ace of
               spades.'

     THE MAGICIAN

     Watching. The snakes are moving around her chair. She
     gestures for them to stop -- instantly, they go still.

     MAVERICK

     Still in the reverie.

                          MAVERICK
               I closed my eyes and she shuffled
               and I cut --
                    (beat)
               -- but I failed. Got a spade, but
               it was just the nine, anyone can do
               that.

                          THE MAGICIAN
               I'll get some cards. This time
               you'll cut the ace for sure.

                          MAVERICK
               It won't work.

                                                   THE MAGICIAN
     Try.

                          MAVERICK (CONT’D)
               I'm not going to do it. I'm not
               going to fail again -- get that
               through your head.


     THE MAGICIAN

     as suddenly she makes a sound we haven't heard from her
     before and --


     RATTLERS STARTING TO GO WILD AND --


     MAVERICK STARING, FROZEN --

                          MAVERICK
               Maybe I will give it a shot after
               all.

     The Magician makes another strange sound.

     calm own.

     The snakes

                                                   THE MAGICIAN
     Somehow I figured you might
     change your mind.
     Now, from that --

     DECK OF CARDS

     The Magician is finishing shuffling. She plops them down on
     the tree trunk, makes a neat pile.

     PULL BACK to reveal:

     MAVERICK AND THE MAGICIAN

     seated across from each other. The snakes are all around --
     they seem fascinated, all of them facing the tree trunk.

     Maverick eyes the snakes -- they don't do much for his peace
     of mind or his confidence -- but clearly, he has no
     confidence anyway.

     THE MAGICIAN

     She places the wad of money next to the cards, gestures for
     Maverick to start. He hesitates, then --

     MAVERICK

     He starts breathing more deeply. It's almost as if he's
     trying to enter a different state. He stares up --

     GIANT CLOUDS

     moved by the wind.

     THE MAGICIAN

     waiting.

     RATTLESNAKES

     waiting.

                          MAVERICK (CONT’D)
               Voice almost in a reverie.

                                                       MAVERICK

     I guess.

                          THE MAGICIAN
               Well, quit it!


     CLOSEUP - MAVERICK

     He puts his hands in his lap.

     It's as if he's trying to go into a deep trance now.

     He's breathing deeply.

     wind turns into MUSIC.

     THE MAGICIAN

     caught up in it, watching. The snakes seems caught up in it
     too -- they aren't watching the cards anymore; they're turned
     to Maverick.
     And now something strange: the
     A gorgeous theme. It plays on.


     MAVERICK

     And now he closes his eyes. His breathing grows very deep.
     The wind MUSIC is louder, more beautiful.

     He drops his hands into his lap.

     His head lolls back -- and suddenly the music is gone --

     -- his eyes open, he shakes his head.

                          MAVERICK
               I was trying to go somewhere in my
               mind. Couldn't.

                          THE MAGICIAN
               I was watching -- you were getting
               into a trance -- you were almost
               there.

                          MAVERICK
                    (dubious)
               You just want it to happen, that's
               all -- nothing felt right.

                          THE MAGICIAN
               You give up too fast -- if magic
               was easy, everyone would do it. You
               want to win that poker thing, don't
               you?

     I do.

                          THE MAGICIAN (CONT’D)
               Well, you're not gonna win nothing
               without a spot deep inside that
               tells you it's okay. A spot that
               says, 'Be a fool if you want, just
               be the best fool around, and I'll
               stay with you forever.'

                          MAVERICK
               I don't want to be a fool.

                          THE MAGICIAN
               You think when I was little and
               playing with dolls I thought, 'I
               can't wait to grow up so I can be a
               hermit and have rattlesnakes for
               friends?'


     CLOSEUP - THE MAGICIAN

                          THE MAGICIAN
               I was whipped and beaten and left
               to die and I could have, but that
               spot talked to me, it told me, 'No,
               don't let the world piss on you,
               it's okay to live alone, rattlers
               don't talk back and they're more
               honest than most people, get a move
               on.'
                    (beat)
               Now I'm a great hermit and I
               wouldn't be nothing else.


     RATTLERS

     They have been watching The Magician.

     at Maverick.

     Now they look

                          MAVERICK
                    (soft)
               I was whipped and beaten and left
               to die.

                          THE MAGICIAN
               Point of my story.


     MAVERICK

     For a moment, he doesn't move at all. Then he sits deeper in
     the chair again, closes his eyes, breathes deep, deeper. The
     wind MUSIC is back.

     His hands are limp in his lap.
     The music is glorious.

     THE MAGICIAN

     Watching. She picks up a rattler, strokes it for luck, puts
     it back.

     MAVERICK

     His voice strange.
     The MUSIC CONTINUES through this.

                                                       MAVERICK

     CARDS

     on the tree stump, Maverick's hand, still limp, resting on
     them --

     -- then the hand gains tension --

     -- the fingers move --

     God knows where he is now but he's a long way from here.

     The breathing deep, regular; the eyes shut. The wind music
     has never been as fine.

     A LIFE OF ITS OWN.

     MAVERICK'S HAND

     We're on the Columbia River on a gorgeous afternoon. Off by

     She's thrilled he's there, holds him, kisses his cheek.

               Bret?! Bret Maverick!! Oh my god!
               My very own hero, alive and well.

     She checks his body.

               You seem glad to see me... I'm not
               exactly a whole man anymore.

     He holds up his right hand, which is up his sleeve, he
     reveals it into her face and she screams. She clutches it to
     her breast and then realizes its intimacy and slaps him.

                          ANNABELLE
               How did you ever escape from those
               hostiles?

               Mrs. Bransford, I like to think I
               enjoy a prank as much as the next
               man, but have you no memory of
               robbing me blind as I went off to
               face death with the Indians?

               Then?... Then when and why?

                          ANNABELLE
               I had to protect my fifty percent.

                          MAVERICK
               Fifty percent? Last I heard it was
               thirty.

     It was forty.
     about it.

     I feel real terrible

                          MAVERICK (CONT’D)
               Not terrible enough to give it
               back.

               I don't want to seem ungrateful but
               why did you omit that three
               thousand dollars?

                          MAVERICK
               Did I do that? I'm sorry, I didn't
               mean to stiff you.

                    (she can't)
               And my poor pure heart was so set
               on it.

     Maverick.
     Without hesitation...

     MAN

     we didn't quite see before as Maverick taps him.
     Now --

                          MAVERICK
               Excuse me, folks. Could I have a
               word with you?

     way.

               about you when I started
               investigating the murder. Once I
               jailed him, he told the truth. And
               I think you will too.

               But I am no American.

               of ten years and a three thousand

     confident. Maverick takes out his money, stares at it.

     edgy. He tilts his head, as if listening for some-thing --

     INT. MAIN SALON - DAY

     Four musicians. They never stop playing. The group consists
     of a fiddler, a cornet player, a fifer, and the fourth has an
     upright piano.

     Their repertoire is stuff like "Sweet Betsy From Pike," "Lily
     Dale," "The Yellow Rose of Texas," many lovely sentimental
     love songs of the 1870s.

     They only add to the excitement and hubbub.

     the ship.

     The Commodore is beautifully and expensively dressed.

     When he smiles, which comes easily, it's very winning.

     He's bright, shrewd, and has been a leader all his life.

               Welcome to my ship and the First
               Ever Annual Championship. The only
               reason it exists is because I have
               every intention of winning it.
                    (smiles)
               Some of you know me. Some of you
               even like me. 'Course, some of you
               are probably fools.
                    (as there is laughter; he
                     acknowledges it happily)
               The truth is this: I'm a great
               businessman and a great poker
               player which, along with my great
               natural modesty, makes me so
               enchanting.
                    (now he turns serious)
               Rules are simple. We play 'til we
               drop. Winner takes all. Dealer can
               call one break of one half hour.
               Soon as you're busted, you're gone.
               Twenty of us are playing which
               means there's gonna be nineteen
               broken hearts. Because I plan on
               winning it all -- half a million
               cash -- by morning.

     And ON as before.

     Half a million is a fortune and this registers.

     -- only now we see him through Maverick's eyes -- and what
     he's doing, and doing brilliantly, is manipulating the cards.

     Sometimes he deals from the top, sometimes

     the bottom, sometimes the second card, sometimes the third,
     and sometimes from the middle of the deck which is brutally
     hard.

     Don't give up on the boy -- at least it's shit with
     potential.


     MAVERICK

     He stays, pushing chips into the pot.

     So do the other three.

     POT

     A lot of chips.

     The Tough Dealer.
     Over fifty thousand dollars' worth.
     To Stuttering.

                                                   TOUGH DEALER
     How many cards?

     Stuttering smiles.

                          MAVERICK
               He stands.

     Twitchy nods.

                          THE ANGEL

     He gets it from the Dealer, looks at it, seems concerned.

               I kind of like that. Shows trust.

     Coop shuffles the cards quickly, hands them over.

     Watching, as The Angel finishes

     And now he closes his eyes. He seems, at this tense mo-ment,

     listens a moment more, then opens his eyes.

     DECK

     as now The Angel takes a single finger, pushes the top card
     across the table to Maverick.

     Who does an amazing thing --

     -- he doesn't look at it.

     Just leaves it face down on the table.

               Coop probably never had a dishonest
               thought 'til this happened. And for
               the rest of his days. He's going to
               be haunted whatever we do. And
               that's punishment enough for a man.

               has more wisdom now about what's
               really valuable than I'll ever
               have. I had two wives leave me on
               account of my obsession with making
               money.

                     glass -- toasting)

     All on board echo The Commodore's toast.

     MAVERICK

     as Annabelle joins him; doing his best to keep his emotions
     in check -- but no question about it, at this moment, he is a
     proud young man. Now, from that --


     INT. MAVERICK'S STATEROOM - MORNING

     Annabelle, her eyes closed.

     She's in Maverick's room and he is taking off her suit coat.
     He lays it over a chair. She stands as before, in skirt and
     expensive blouse.

                          ANNABELLE
               When can I open my eyes? -- what is
               this gift I'm getting?

     And on that --

     MAVERICK

     as he suddenly grabs her lovely blouse and rips it wide open
     --

     -- Annabelle, shocked, cries out, opens her eyes, her hands
     trying to cover her suddenly revealed body --

     -- but too late.

     Over her slip she is wearing the most Rube Goldberg-like
     thing you ever saw. (It was called the Kepplinger Hold-out
     and was a series of pulleys and cords that hid a remarkable
     number of cards. The thing worked, believe it or not, by
     using the knees, and is generally thought of as being the
     greatest card-cheating device of the past century.)

                    (embarrassed)
               I didn't wear it 'til the break --

                          MAVERICK
               -- and you didn't have to. Here's
               my gift to you: the truth. You were
               one of the six best players out
               there.
                    (pulling the holdout off
                     her)
               Get rid of this.

                          ANNABELLE
                    (confused, embarrassed,
                     touched)
               Would you believe me if I told you
               it didn't work? Look -- all the
               cards are still there --
               Contraption just jammed on me, I
               couldn't get it to function.
                    (now, as her arms go
                     around Maverick)
               Let's hope I have better luck with
               you.

                          MAVERICK
               Where you headed?

                          ANNABELLE
                    (a shrug -- she doesn't
                     know)
               Someplace else.

                          MAVERICK
               I'm going there too. Want to travel
               together? I could use the
               protection.


     ANNABELLE

     Long pause.
     Then --

                          ANNABELLE
               No. It would be wonderful, we could
               fight all the time. But I wouldn't
               learn anything about my tells now,
               would I? Take care of yourself.


     TWO OF THEM

     A final embrace. Meaningful. They kiss. She gets into the
     carriage and Maverick closes the door. The Driver gets on his
     seat.

                                                       MAVERICK
     Annabelle?

     She turns back.

     from her purse.

     He hands her a wallet he's just taken

                          ANNABELLE
                    (impressed)
               That was good. You're getting
               better.
                    (beat)
               Bert.

     Now she hands him his watch she's taken.

                          MAVERICK
               You are the best at that.

     EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT

     The half million in cash.

     satchel is alongside.

     PULL BACK to reveal:
     Separated into two piles.

     The

     Coop, nervously waiting alone in a rocky place on the edge of
     nowhere. A small fire is the only illumination.

     A stream flows by.

     Now, the sound of a WALKING SLOWLY.

     Coop draws his GUN, COCKS it -- it makes a distinct sound --
     The sound STOPS.

     -- KUH -- LICK --

     -- he stares out into the darkness, ready for anything.

     Then he relaxes, puts the gun back into its holster.

                          COOP
               Where the hell you been?

     PULL BACK to reveal:

     The Coomodore.
     He moves to the fire.
     THE COMMODORE
     I had to say good-bye. I couldn't
     risk looking like I was rushing
     any place. I took a lot of twists
     and turns, backtracking a lot.
     Made sure nobody was following me.
     You don't seem happy to see me.

                          COOP (CONT’D)
                    (angry)
               I thought you and me were in this
               thing together -- you win, I do
               nothing. Someone else wins, I do
               what I did. Why didn't you tell me
               Angel was in it too?

                          THE COMMODORE
               What did Maverick say to that sweet
               young thing? 'You never want to
               give everything away.' If Angel'd
               won, we'd still have split it the
               same way. I telegraphed him -- keep
               Maverick from the game. He messed
               that up. Poor dead bastard.

                          COOP
               I just don't like secrets.

                          THE COMMODORE
               Then you probably won't like this
               one either.

     THE COMMODORE

     as suddenly he draws his gun, cocks it --

     -- there's that sound again --

     -- KUH -- LICK --

     -- and the GUN is aimed at Coop's heart.

                          THE COMMODORE (CONT’D)
               I guess it's just my greedy nature.
               But I've decided not to share it
               with you --

                          COOP
                    (shocked)
               A deal's a deal.

                          THE COMMODORE
               In a perfect world, that's true.
                    (throws Coop's gun in the
                     water, ready to fire)
               I just want you to know I've never
               worked with a more honest man in my
               life.

     Now -- A familiar sound:


     -- KUH -- LICK --

                          MAVERICK
               I wouldn't give odds on it being a
               long one. Uncock it.

     MAVERICK

     moving fast, gun drawn. With speed and precision he grabs The
     Commodore's pistol.

     They raise their hands as he gestures for them to sit close
     together.

                          MAVERICK
               Sit down, gentlemen. Let's get
               cozy. Have a parley. Put your hands
               down. You look ridiculous. I almost
               fell asleep with boredom following
               you -- you and that idiot speech
               about my wisdom -- how could you
               expect me to fall for that? You
               must think I'm awful damn dumb.
                    (to Coop)
               But you... you fooled me. And not
               many can. But you saved me, so I
               won't kill you.

               Just remember, the whole world
               knows what you are. That's
               punishment enough. All your life's
               work, all the good you did, you
               wiped it away. You don't have
               anything to show for it.

                          COOP
               You're young, so you don't know
               that much about mistakes, but
               you're making one now.

                                                       MAVERICK

     And we've never seen him like this -- out of control.

               What you said, every word, that's

     MAVERICK

     Puts the satchel full of money down.

                          MAVERICK
               You couldn't sneak up on a corpse,
               Coop; not anymore. You're just
               another decrepit old has-been.


     THE COMMODORE

     scared, as Maverick studies his pistol.

                          THE COMMODORE
               What're you gonna do?

                          MAVERICK
               It's a problem -- if I don't kill
               you, what do I do?


     COOP WATCHING, THE FURY STILL THERE. MAVERICK A SHRUG.

                          MAVERICK
               What the heck!


     MAVERICK

     His hands fiddle a little with the gun, we can't really see
     what he's doing. Then he points the gun at the Commodore, as
     if to shoot him, then, at the last minute he flicks the GUN
     to the side and SHOOTS. The bullet just misses the Commodore
     and scares him very badly.

                          MAVERICK
               Maybe the fairest thing would be to
               just let one of you kill the other

     deadly smile.

               Well, that -- as they say, is that!

     And the Commodore pulls the trigger.

     CLICK!

     nothing.

     CLICK, CLICK, CLICK!!!

     There are no bullets in the gun!

     Now obviously outclassed, the Commodore knows that he is a

     He punches him in the stomach and knocks his hat off.

     Coop punches him in the face and the Commodore is knocked
     over a log. The Commodore tries to get up over the log.

     Coop hits him with an uppercut and knocks him over and on his
     back.

     It is the towels that alert us to where we are, for on them
     is embroidered the name of the hotel: THE SAN FRANCISCAN.

     Maverick lies happily in one of the tubs. Eyes closed.

     His clothes are piled nearby. His gun too. And along-side his
     boots: the satchel.

     He is at peace, listening to the sound of the WIND MUSIC --

               got the same eyes, you both kiss
               the same way, you both draw your
               guns the same way --
                    (a breath)
               -- and you both sing the same wrong
               words to 'Amazing Grace.'

     Now, she studies their naked bodies in the tubs.


     CLOSEUP - ANNABELLE

                          ANNABELLE
               Oh my yes, there are just a lot of
               splendid similarities...

     She smiles her dazzling smile, goes to the door, opens it,
     blows a kiss -- impossible to say to which man --

     and good-bye.

     MAVERICK AND PAPPY

     They stare at the door a moment. Neither of them seems
     anxious to get moving or particularly upset.

                          PAPPY
               Woman with her looks can't hide.

                          MAVERICK
                    (nods)
               Whenever we decide to catch her --
                    (snaps his fingers)
               -- it's done.

                          PAPPY
                    (nods too)
               The truth? If someone had to rob
               us, I'm glad it was my little
               Annie.

     He's never called her that before.

     MAVERICK

     as this registers.

                          MAVERICK
               Your little what?
                    (beat)
               I'll tell you the real truth --
               every time you got near her, it
               was...
                    (squints)
               ... I'm looking for the right word
               -- you are, after all, the man who
               raised me and I hold you in the
               highest respect...
                    (beat)
               It was disgusting.


     PAPPY

     as this registers.

                          PAPPY
                    (chuckles)
               My my, green with envy.

     TWO OF THEM

     some heat now.

                          MAVERICK
               You're right.
                    (beat)
               After all, when she's a hundred,
               you'll only be a hundred and
               thirty-five.

                          PAPPY
               I would be careful if I were you --
               just know that splendid creature
               was almost your stepmother.

                          MAVERICK
               She was a lot closer to being your
               daughter-in-law.

                          PAPPY
               Would have been sheer disaster --
               you're totally lacking in the
               maturity needed to satisfy a woman
               like that.

                          MAVERICK
               Not what she said.

                          PAPPY
               I know what she said about you --
               and I would never humiliate you by
               repeating those terrible words.

                          MAVERICK
               I don't believe you.

                                                          PAPPY
     Neither do I.

     Now they both start to laugh, lie back.
     A pause.

                          PAPPY
               What we ended up with is one half
               million dollar silk shirt.

                          MAVERICK
               Quarter of a million's more like it
               -- I mixed in a Sears catalog along
               with the cash -- Annabelle'll enjoy
               that.
                    (beat)
               Hope you enjoy this.

     MAVERICK

     as he takes a quarter of a million in cash from his boot and
     hands it to his father.

     PAPPY

     There are no words for what he feels, but you know he is
     deeply moved by the gesture.

     MAVERICK

     pleased and proud.

     TWO OF THEM

     as Pappy takes the money, holds it in one hand.

                          PAPPY
                    (soft; an emotional moment
                     is on the horizon)
               ... Bret... son...

                          MAVERICK
                    (quiet)
               Yessir?

                          PAPPY
                    (zap)
               This feels like you shorted me --
               I'm going to count it back in the
               room.

                          MAVERICK
                    (zap)
               That might take the rest of the
               week since we all know your trouble
               with counting once you get past
               your fingers and toes.

     They look at each other.

     And then they smile.

     Then --
     And lie silent for a moment.

     CAMERA begins to PULL BACK.

     and now Maverick begins to hum "Amazing Grace."

     Pappy joins him, doing the harmony.

     CAMERA continues PULLING BACK.

     MAVERICK STARTS TO SING THE SONG.


     PAPPY JOINS HIM, DOING THE HARMONY. IT'S JUST LOVELY.


     INT./EXT. FANCY BATHROOM (SAN FRANCISCO) - DUSK


     CAMERA PULLS BACK AND OUT THE WINDOW TO REVEAL THE EXTERIOR
     OF THE BEAUTIFUL HOTEL AND THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO.


     THE TWO OF THEM SING ON. CLEAR.

     Their voices ring out loud and


     THEY'VE NEVER SOUNDED BETTER.


     LET'S LEAVE THEM THERE...

                                                FINAL FADE OUT.

     THE END
