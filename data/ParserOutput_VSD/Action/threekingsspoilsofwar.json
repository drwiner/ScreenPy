It is similar to the Shi'ite camps we've see before with several tent dwellings.  As the party enters groups of Shi'ites come over to stare Epps and Jaeger.  They chatter amongst themselves, but ou boys have no idea what they're talking about, and that ju makes things all the scarier. From our boy's point of view this is all like an unending nightmare:  Being dragged along through a desert, not kno the language, not knowing what's going to happen.  Their  world skews and slides as if they were on a tilt-a-whirl. Finally they reach a tent.  One of the Arabs tosses Epps Jaeger's packs on the ground just before it.  Another cut them loose and SHOVES THEM INSIDE THE TENT, then yells  something at them in Arabic.  He leaves, and our two are alone. ",

A smart man could have made his way up to Syria or Turkey. A smart man could have gotten himself right out of the Middle East.  A smart man with enough gold.
