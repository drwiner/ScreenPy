This character likes girls; his aloofness is modified, his face changes when he talks to them. The airline girl smiles back, she finds him attract We don't hear what they are saying, no dialogue on track it is obvious he is flirting with the girl in a mild way, now a frown comes on his face and he turns his head as if slightly annoyed by something. CUT TO a POV shot of a tall, gaunt, almost totally bald m at the next ticket counter. The man is about sixty-five a looks like a half senile Great Dane. He is DAVE WILKIE, erstwhile husband of the heroine of this story. Age has n been at all kind to Dave; his face is lined with bitterne he is a sour, angry, lonely man and now he is making a ve unpleasant scene with a ticket girl and an airline representative, waving his ticket and gesticulating angri He wears an expensive, ill-fitting suit and a Texas-type We don't hear his angry complaints, no dialogue is on the track. CUT BACK to a CLOSE SHOT of Willcox Hillyer as he stares a frown at the man. It's as if he knows the man but can't place him. The airline ticket girl speaks to him and he t back to her, his face softening as he answers her, obviou saying he'll carry his bag. He nods goodbye to the girl, turns and the CAMERA follows him as he walks some distanc away and stops, looks back with another pensive frown at tall, gaunt man at the next counter. CUT TO ANOTHER POV shot of Dave Wilkie, a longer shot tha the first. The man is now arguing angrily with two airlin representatives, still waving his ticket and shaking his head. We don't hear him. Lip-readers might pick up what h saying: \"I'm supposed to be in first class, not tourist. What's the matter with this friggin' airline?\" CUT BACK TO Willcox Hillyer, a CLOSE SHOT of his face as rubs his chin and frowns obviously struggling to remember man. The CAMERA holds on him as he stares at the gaunt an Dave, racking his brain. He shakes his head, he cannot pl the man and yet he knows him. The CAMERA moves in closer Willcox Hillyer's face as he stares in pensive puzzlement this ghost from the past and now we hear, as if from a distance, FAINT MUSIC on the track -- it is \"Dixie,\" play with beautiful lazy mocking love by the great Louis Armst in his prime. At first we can barely hear it, then the MU becomes LOUDER as Hillyer's frown deepens and he seems al to know the man.",

She is carrying a cardboard suitcase tied with a string. Her clothes are cheap, her shoes are dusty, runs are in her stockings. She is sweaty, tired an seems very nervous. ROSE is a very attractive girl, but h primary quality is not sexiness, but an innocence and sweetness. She pauses to wipe sweat from her forehead wit the back of her hand and nervously moistens her lips as s stares ahead uncertainly at the \"nice\" Southern home whic her seems very grand. It is apparent she is badly frighte and apprehensive about what lies ahead. She is also exhau from the heat and a long hot walk in the Southern sun. Sh blinks at perspiration, swallows in anxiety again and for herself to walk on.",

I have to warn you about him, he can be very dangerous, there is an evil streak in him, a streak of pure sheer meanness.

And beneath that, in smaller letters: \"Mr. Dithe Comes to Dinner -- and How!\" We see Buddy's hands in the shot, and he opens the pamphlet and we catch enough of a glimpse of the thing to know it is pretty awful -- a draw maybe of \"Blondie\" stark naked with a finger in her mouth going, \"Tee-Hee!\" ON Buddy, as he stares down with grave intentness at the Little Dirty Comic Book. Slyly now, he retraces his steps the bureau and takes out a flashlight. He goes back to th bed, switches off the lamp, gets in the bed and turns on flashlight and pulls the covers over his head. We hear a faint SOUND on the track and Buddy suddenly yanks back th covers, puts the flashlight on the table by the bed and throws the Little Dirty Comic Book under the bed. He lies pillow and pretends he's asleep, and we hear the door of room OPEN and a CREAKING on the floor.
