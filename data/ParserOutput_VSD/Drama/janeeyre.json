She carries a shawl and has a small bag of belongings over her shoulder. She trips, falls to her knees; looks back. Expressive eye open features. She is desperate. We see the house she is running from; a Jacobean battlemented mansion. Her need to escape is so great that she crawls forward until she is able to raise herself to her feet. She runs. She reaches an antique stile by a brook. She lifts hersel on to it. She lands on the road. And runs. I/E. DAY. A ROADSIDE/COACH. The sun is higher in the sky. Jane exhausted, now running down a main road. Her spirts lift at the sight of an approaching coach. She flags it down. Jane empties her purse into the driver's hand. He looks a her money then suspiciously back at her. A terse nod indicates she can get in.",

She undertakes a tremendous effort not to betray he emotional state. She doesn't sob, she doesn't howl - although her breathing threatens to. Slowly, unable to be the day, she closes her eyes. EXT. EVENING. WHITCROSS. Sunset. A whitewashed, stone pillar set up where four roa meet on a barren moor. The coach driver opens the door. With a curt nod he indicates that Jane must get out. She looks around, dismayed. In each direction there is op moorland for as far as the eye can see. The driver sets o at a good pace - glad to be rid of such a passenger. Jane puts her hand to her side for her bag of belongings. It i not there. She runs as fast as she can after the coach. It is recedi towards the horizon. She comes to a halt, objectless, los alone. She pulls her knitted shawl around her. She leaves the road and sets off across the moor, into th gathering dark. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 2. EXT. NIGHT. THE MOOR. Jane is on her knees by a strange overhanging rock. The night sky is awesome; the universe is all around her. She is trying to calm herself with a prayer. EXT. DAY. THE MOOR. Jane lies on a great rock, soaking up the heat of the sun She is like someone numb with pain. She watches a lizard crawl over the rock. She is mesmerised. EXT. TWILIGHT. THE MOOR. Jane squats in the heather and eats bilberries as the lig fades. She hungrily licks the juice from her hand. EXT. DAWN. THE MOOR. Jane is asleep in the heather, her shawl wrapped around her. A red-haired child in a white nightgown lies by her side, watching her. It is Helen Burns. Helen reaches out. She touches Jane's hand. Jane wakes. S sits up. She is alone. EXT. DAY. BY A RIVER. Jane is crouched on a rock watching the waters go by. The sky is overcast. The first big drops of rain land on the stones. Jane makes no movement. A raven lands on a rock nearby. Jane is suddenly filled with a wild rage. She picks up a stone and hurls it at th bird with a raw cry. The gesture exhausts her. She watche the bird wheel away, as the rain starts to pour. EXT. TWILIGHT. A FARM BY A WOOD. It is raining hard. Jane sees a small girl come out of th farm with some leftovers. She drops them into a pigpen.",

The moors rise away above her to the horizon. Jane looks at the sun starting to set. The clouds are red and gold. She sees a small red-haired girl in a white nightgown walking barefoot on the moors ahead of her. The girl turn looks back at Jane. With her last strength, Jane follows. EXT. EVENING. THE MOOR. Dark clouds are banking up; the rain starts again. Jane i struggling through a marsh. Her boots are stuck. She falls. Her hand disappears into mud; her face pressed against the earth. She doesn't move. She has reached the point of despair. The girl's bare feet walk close by, as if waiting for her Jane looks up. Where the child should be, she sees a ligh shining across the moor.

In front of Jane, a stone fireplace gapes like a mouth. Beside it, a full length looking-glass in which her pale reflection stares out. Behind her, a bed supported on pillars of mahogany, hung with red. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 9. The piled up pillows and mattresses glare in cold white. Jane's breathing is the only sound in the room. A sudden gust sends rain pelting against the windows like fingernails. A distant moan of wind seems to breathe out the black hearth. Jane reverts her nervous gaze to the pitted mirror. Her eyes lock on the small figure trapped the mirror's visionary hollow; her white, bleeding face, her eyes glittering with fear. It is a phantom. The eyes are black, the skin a deathly grey. Blood. Jane's breathing becomes choked with terror. She can't get her breath. We hear blood rushing through h ears. It sounds like the beating of great wings. Slowly, a light appears over her. It may be something shining in from outside. But to Jane it seems as if it is surrounding her, enveloping her. The figure in the lookin glass opens its mouth. The scream, held in so long, final rips from Jane's throat. INT. DUSK. GATESHEAD - THE FIRESIDE. At the sound of the scream, Mrs Reed, slumbering, almost jumps out of her skin. INT. DUSK. GATESHEAD - THE KITCHEN. Miss Abbott almost drops the tea tray she is carrying. INT. DUSK.

Rochester has stood Bertha at his desk. A case of jewels open before her. She has put on a tiara, a diamond necklace, bracelets. She is gazing at a ruby brooch. She turns to Rochester. His expression is calm, resigned. Bertha begins to laugh. She takes the candelabra from the table. She admires herself in the mirror; her white shift, the black feather the jewels. She holds up the candelabra and sets the huge curtains alight. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 116. Rochester is impassive; he does nothing to stop her. As s passes, Rochester realises he is bleeding. She has run th brooch pin across him. INT. EVENING. THORNFIELD - THE HALL/STAIRS. Bertha knocks a lamp onto the floor. The oil springs into flames, licking the tapestries and the paintings. Rochest sees his ancestors begin to burn.",

She comes to a pair of rusting iron gates hanging open between granite pillars. She walks through them. She finds herself in front of a decrepit Elizabethan mano house; no garden, just a sweeping semi circle of meadow grass, which someone has cut at with a scythe. Jane stops Standing on the threshold is Edward Fairfax Rochester. He is in his shirtsleeves. He stands strong, stalwart, brooding. His hair is still raven black. He is looking sightlessly around his domain, with the concentration of hawk. His strength is undiminished. He walks fifteen paces from the house. It brings him into the middle of the semicircle of grass. He is close enough for Jane to see his scarred eyes. She walks towards him, silent. A few drops of rain begin to fall. Rochester puts out his right hand to feel them. He raises his face up to the sky as if he is looking for something from there. He is absolutely still; his expression, serene. Jane is very close.
