A shel explodes next to him, and he leaps entirely over a trench Another explosion sends him leaping, but not far enough - finds himself crashing downwards, and into a trench - and races through it - and finds himself charging towards a German company. Both sides are equally startled - Joey charging through a thin trench lined with German soldiers the soldiers, finding a live horse careering through them In desperation, Joey scrambles out of the trench - and on again, rushes away from the fighting... 86. But now it is very dark indeed - he is stumbling as he ru there is blood mixed with the mud on his legs. Now it is total night - fog - confusion - he jumps again. now everywhere there are potholes - the land is massively uneven - shells are exploding all around. And suddenly se in front of him barbed wire. He crashes through it - more he bursts through again - now dragging barriers behind hi the barriers tangle, pulling him up short - he flips and lands amongst even more barbed wire. He pulls and turns to release himself but it is impossibl The more he pulls, the more firmly he is trapped. He rise up, wild, magnificent, a beast fighting for his life. He is completely trapped. He cannot move. He cannot see. is in pain. He falls. It feels like an end. EXT. BRITISH TRENCH. THE SAME."
