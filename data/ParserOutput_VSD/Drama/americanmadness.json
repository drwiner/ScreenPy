CHARLIE Nine o'clock and all is lousy! 1ST TELLER Yes, I spend half of my life waiting  for these time clocks to open. Say,  where's Matt? CHARLIE Probably upstairs thinking up that daily  joke. 2ND TELLER That guy kills me with his wisecracks. 3RD TELLER Say, when he comes in, let's put on  a frozen face. Let's not smile. They ad-lib agreement. 1ST TELLER Shhh! Nix! Here he comes 7. MED. SHOT CAMERA PICKS UP Matt Brown, the chief  teller, as he strides briskly in and  begins turning the combination dial  to the main vault. He is about twenty-six,  a clean-looking, personable youngster.  Several of the tellers are standing  close to him, looking on. MATT How are you doing slaves? TELLERS Hello, Matt. How're you Matt? Matt begins to work the combination  of the main lock. MATT (with his back to them) Say, did you boys ever hear the story  of the pawnbroker with the glass eye? 1ST TELLER No Matt, what is the story about the  pawnbroker with the glass eye? MATT (as he continues to fiddle with the  lock) Well, I'll tell you. A fellow went into  this shop to pawn his watch. The pawnbroker  said, \"I'll give you $50 for it, if  you can tell me which is my glass eye.\"  The fellow said, \"All right, I'll do  that. It's the right one.\" The pawnbroker  said, \"That's correct. But how did you  know it was the right one?\" The fellow ? 105 ? said, \"well, it's got more sympathy  than the other one.\" He turns, expecting their laugh, but  is confronted by stone faces. MATT Sympathy! You know, the right one had  more sympathy than the other one! 1ST TELLER What's the matter? Can't you get this  thing open? Matt stares in disbelief, then gets  the joke. MATT (contemptuously) Six reasons why banks fail! This cracks them all up, as a uniformed  officer, who has been standing by, works  a lever attached to the floor, which  lowers a section of the floor, directly  in front of the vault. This permits  the vault door, which is sunk below  the floor level, to swing open. TELLERS (ad-libbing) I love your jokes, Matt! They're so  entertaining! A very funny man! 8. MED. SHOT Matt opens the inside door, made up  of perpendicular steel bars. The tellers  scurry into the cavernous-looking interior.  Someone snaps on a light. CAMERA TRUCKS  UP TO VAULT. The back walls of the vault are lined  with steel cabinets divided into many  small compartments. On one side is a  wall safe which is also opened by a  combination and which contains the surplus  cash carried by the bank. Matt is in  charge of this. All around the room  are numerous hand trucks - one for every  teller. These trucks contain the cash  in the charge of the individual tellers.  While the tellers in the b.g. obtain  their keys and open the drawers of their  trucks, Matt examines the time clock  which is attached to the inside of the  vault door. 9. INT. VAULT - MED. CLOSE SHOT At the door, as Matt enters and goes  directly to the burglar alarm box to  the left of the doorway. He leans over  to throw off the burglar alarm switch. CUT TO: 10. CLOSEUP - BURGLAR ALARM SWITCH The handle of the switch points in the  direction of a sign reading ON. Matt's  hand comes into the scene and throws  the switch up toward a sign reading  OFF. This is done with no comment, it  being a routine matter with Matt. MATT Come on, white collars. The day's started! 11. MED. SHOT As the tellers file out with their trucks.  Before they do, however, each one signs  the cashbook. One or two exit silently. ? 106 ? 12. CLOSE SHOT - MATT As one of the tellers comes into scene.  Matt examines the cashbook. MATT You're carrying too much money on you,  Hank. You better turn some in tonight. MATT (as he goes) Okay, Matt. He exits out of scene. MATT How are you fixed? TELLER I'm okay, Matt. MATT (to another teller) You've got enough? 2ND TELLER I'll be all right. Charlie, the last man, comes up. CHARLIE Say Matt, I'll have to have some money  for those Manville payrolls. MATT How much? CHARLIE About twenty-four thousand. MATT (counting out money) It was more than that last week. CHARLIE Yeah. MATT Here's twenty-five thousand. He hands Charlie four stacks of bills.  As Charlie is signing the cash book,  Matt speaks: MATT Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie? CHARLIE Yeah. MATT Let me have ten bucks? CHARLIE (aghast) Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks,  I'd quit. MATT Charlie! ? 107 ? CHARLIE Yeah? Charlie starts out. Matt follows him. 13. OUTSIDE OF VAULT - MED. CLOSE SHOT As Charlie comes out, followed by Matt.  CAMERA TRUCKS ALONG WITH THEM as they  walk. MATT (as they walk) I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on  the level I will. Give a guy a break,  will you? I've got to get it back in  my account. If Helen ever finds out  that I CHARLIE (unsympathetically) Baby, I can't give you anything but  love . . .[2] LAP DISSOLVE TO: 14. INT. MAIN FLOOR OF BANK - BACKSTAGE CAMERA TRUCKS with them as Charlie pushes  his truck forward and Matt walks alongside  of him. En route, CAMERA TAKES IN ATMOSPHERIC  SHOTS of the general activity backstage  of the bank. Male and female clerks stand around  at various angles, checking away at  adding machines. Several are assisted  by someone who calls off figures to  them as they record it on machines.  We hear these figures read in a monotone  as we pass them. Matt is still trying to pry the ten  dollars loose from Charlie. MATT Now listen Charlie. I'll give you an  I.O.U. I'll give you a note, I'll pay  your mortgage, it's a matter of life  and death Ad-lib conversations from the other  clerks distract his attention. CHARLIE Whose death? MATT It'll be yours if you don't kick in  with that ten bucks. CHARLIE Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression? MATT Aw, nerts! Charlie arrives at his cage. CAMERA  STOPS with them. CHARLIE Come over and see us sometime. CAMERA CONTINUES TO FOLLOW Matt as he  continues on to his cage, muttering  half to himself. MATT I'm not asking you to pay off the Depression.  I'm only asking you for ten bucks! ? 108 ? Another teller is busy in the cage next  to him. Matt addresses him, referring  to Charlie. MATT That mug reminds me of a guy with his  second dollar. TELLER Yeah, what did he do with his first  one? MATT Bought himself a pocketbook! The teller laughs heartily. 15. MED. SHOT THE CAMERA PICKS UP Helen as she crosses  the main floor of the bank, reaches  Matt's teller window and pushes it open. MATT Hello, Helen! HELEN (conspiratorially) Matt, come here! MATT Why? HELEN Come here, honey! He leans over, and she gives him a quick  kiss. MATT Hey, look out, somebody's likely to  see us! HELEN (already walking away) Oh, is that so? She quickly kisses him again, crosses  back, and takes the grand stairs up  to the outer office of the bank president  as Matt watches with a grin. 16. INT. MAIN FLOOR OF BANK - FULL SHOT Just then, a group of five or six important-looking  men enter scene on the way to the conference  room. One of the men looks towards Helen's  desk. 17. MED. SHOT On Helen and a secretary standing next  to her. SECRETARY (to Helen) Oh, oh. Look who's here. 18. MED. SHOT The other clerks and tellers, noticing  the newcomers as they file past. TELLER Hey, psst! ? 109 ? OSCAR Oh, oh. Five ill winds. TELLER (standing next to Oscar) And blowing no good for the old man,  either. 19. CLOSER SHOT ON HELEN'S DESK Shooting toward Helen. HELEN (acidly) The four-and-a-half horsemen.[3] GIRL What are they doing here? There's no  board meeting today. HELEN Search me. By this time, the important group of  men have reached Helen, and are passing  her by, with perfunctory nods. CLARK (the most important of the important-looking  men; to Helen) Mr. Dickson in yet? HELEN Not yet, Mr. Clark. CLARK When he comes in, tell him we're waiting  for him in the board room. HELEN Yes, sir. CLARK And tell him not to delay. HELEN Yes, sir. The group of men file through the board  room door, and out of sight. GIRL (to Helen) Looks like trouble for your boss. HELEN Takes more than two tons of directors  to make trouble for my boss. GIRL (as she turns to go) Sez you! 20. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MED. SHOT Taking in all of room. The directors  are all here, and some sit around a  long, narrow mahogany table. Clark,  the sour-faced old ? 110 ? bird we saw previously talking to Helen,  paces back and forth agitatedly. CLARK I've sent for the cashier, gentlemen.  He has a list of the loans that Dickson  made last month. 21. MED. CLOSE SHOT - CLARK As he stops in his pacing a moment and  addresses the directors further: CLARK And as I told you at breakfast, it is  time we did something about it. 22. CLOSE SHOT - SCHULTZ In thorough accord with Clark's violent  attitude is Schultz, a German, whose  instinctive conservatism rebels against  Dickson's liberal banking methods. SCHULTZ Mr. Clark's right. Dickson will ruin  this bank if we don't stop him. AMES (another conservative stalwart) Looks to me as if we're in hot water  already. A very dignified but meek little old  man, Jonathan Ives, tries horning in: IVES (feeble-voiced) Gentlemen, I was just wondering 23. MED. SHOT As another of the directors, O'Brien,  a large, bull-faced, thunderous-voiced  contractor, rises to Dickson's defense.  (O'Brien is always filing his nails,  even while he talks.) O'BRIEN Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken  about nothing. Dickson's all right. CLARK (interrupting) Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper  than any other institution in the city.  We're fools to tolerate it. SCHULTZ That's what I say. And the only way  to end it is to get Dickson out. 24. CLOSE SHOT - O'BRIEN He looks toward Schultz. O'BRIEN Don't make me laugh, Schultz! 25. MED. CLOSE SHOT - CLARK CLARK Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must  agree to this merger with New York Trust ? 111 ? O'BRIEN What good will that do? CLARK What good will that do? Why, it will  take control away from him. We'll put  somebody else in charge, call in all  doubtful loans, and be on safe ground  again. That's what good it will do! 26. MED. CLOSE SHOT Including Ives in scene with Clark and  O'Brien. Ives is seated, O'Brien and  Clark standing by table. Ives tries  to speak again. IVES It has just occurred to me O'BRIEN (interrupting) You're wasting your time, I tell you.  Dickson won't stand for it. CLARK He'll stand for it, if I have anything  to say about it. Just then they hear door open, and they  all look towards door leading thru to  main floor. 27. MED. CLOSE SHOT - CLUETT As he shuts the door behind him. He  is immaculately groomed, obviously cuts  quite a dash with the women. He looks  off toward the men as Clark's voice  comes in: CLARK'S VOICE Ah - come in, Cluett. CAMERA PANS WITH CLUETT as he comes  forward and puts a paper on the table  before Clark. CLUETT Here's the list. CLARK Yes, thank you. CLUETT Anything else? CLARK No. Nothing. Cluett exits toward door again. Clark  picks up the list and looks at it. Then  he addresses the other men: CLARK Look at this. Just look at this. It's  outrageous. Henry Moore - thirty-six  thousand. Manny Goldberg - eighty-five  hundred. Tony Consero - fifty-six thousand  dollars. Joseph McDonald - eighteen  thousand. Alvin Jones - sixty-six thousand  dollars to a hotel that's on its last  legs. I tell you, people get loans in  this bank that couldn't borrow five  cents anywhere else. ? 112 ? 28. WIDER ANGLE As the other men group around the loan  list, which Clark has put back down  on the table. They all scrutinize it  carefully. SCHULTZ (to the men at large) And on what? \"Hunches,\" he calls it. AMES Some day he'll get a \"hunch\" about a  man and give the bank away. CLARK He's almost done that already. Our chief  teller, Matt Brown, is an example of  that. He breaks into Dickson's house,  holds him up, and the next day gets  a job in the bank. IVES Well, as far as I'm concerned SCHULTZ A boy who should be in jail, handling  a bank's cash! CUT TO: 29. INT. MAIN FLOOR OF BANK - MED. CLOSE  SHOT Shooting toward Matt, inside the teller's  cage, busily counting the money he is  getting ready for Charlie. Helen is outside the cage. 30. CLOSE SHOT Shooting toward Helen. HELEN (skeptically) What did you do with it? MATT With what? HELEN The ten dollars. MATT (quickly) Oh, ten dollars HELEN Yes. MATT (catches himself in time) A friend of mine - yeah, really - his  mother was terribly sick and she was  dying, would you believe it? 31. CLOSE SHOT Shooting toward Matt. As she interrupts him: ? 113 ? HELEN No. MATT Oh, you think I'm lying? HELEN Yes. MATT All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you  called me a liar. HELEN Oh, Matt. He reaches forward and takes her hands. MATT Oh honey, why don't we get married?  Then you can handle it all. Just then Oscar enters the scene, en  route somewhere. He stops beside Matt,  notices he and Helen are holding hands. 32. MED. CLOSE SHOT As Helen and Matt separate guiltily. OSCAR Say, Matt! Matt! Did you hear the news? MATT No, what? OSCAR Pardon me. All the big shots are in  a huddle, and it looks like Dickson's  out on his ear. Helen and Matt react to this piece of  news. They look at one another. Apparently,  it will have a definite effect on their  lives. MATT (to Oscar) Oh, you're kidding me, aren't you? OSCAR No, I'm not kidding. Everybody's talking  about it. Ask her. HELEN I haven't heard about it. OSCAR Sure, everybody's talking about it. 33. CLOSE UP - MATT As he speaks sadly. MATT If that's on the level, there goes my  assistant cashier's job. 34. MED. CLOSE SHOT Taking the three in. ? 114 ? OSCAR Well, I just thought I'd drop by and  cheer you up a bit. As he turns to go out of scene, he looks  at Matt. OSCAR I'll be seeing you, Matt - in the breadline. CUT TO: 35. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM MED. - SHOT The men are all gathered around the  table now. Apparently, they have been  discussing ways and means of ousting  Dickson. As we cut to this scene, Ives is pouring  himself a glass of water. IVES That ham I had this morning was very  salty 36. CLOSER SHOT ON THE GROUP CLARK Gentlemen, let's get organized before  Dickson gets here. Schultz, can I count  on you? 37. CLOSE SHOT On Schultz, who is seated next to Clark. SCHULTZ Absolutely. CLARK What about you, Ames? 38. CLOSE SHOT On Ames, who is seated next to Schultz. AMES That's the way I feel about it. CLARK Ives, how about you? 39. CLOSE SHOT IVES Well, the way I look at it, it seems  that CLARK (interrupting) All right. O'Brien? 40. CLOSE SHOT At other end of table, where O'Brien  is. O'BRIEN Well, you've got an awful fight on your  hands. That's all I've got to say. 41. CLOSE SHOT On Clark, determined. ? 115 ? CLARK Gentlemen, I think it's time that we  do fight. CUT TO: 42. INT. MAIN FLOOR OF BANK - FULL SHOT The outer offices of the bank are in  this shot. A spacious stretch of desks  occupied by clerks and junior officers,  all busily at work. A wizened old doorman is greeting clerks  as they arrive. CLERK (passing by) Hello, Gardiner. GARDINER Good morning. You're on time this morning.  It's about time. We see Dickson, looming in the doorway,  for the first time. 43. CLOSE SHOT As Dickson stops to speak to the doorman.  Dickson is a man of about fifty, whose  looks belie his years. There is a robustness  and virility about him that is compelling.  His very walk radiates power. He now puts his hand on the old man's  shoulder. GARDINER Good morning, Mr. Dickson. DICKSON John, how's your wife this morning? GARDINER (looking up, worship in his eyes) Much better this morning, thank you. DICKSON Got a handkerchief? Gardiner hurriedly produces a handkerchief,  and starts to blow his nose. GARDINER Excuse me DICKSON Wait a minute. (he takes the handkerchief, and polishes  the brass on Gardiner's uniform) How do you feel this morning? GARDINER I'm feeling fine this morning. DICKSON That makes it unanimous. I feel all  right too. GARDINER Thank you! As Dickson exits from scene: ? 116 ? CUT TO: 44. TRUCKING SHOT WITH DICKSON The smile on his face disappears as  he sees something which annoys him. DICKSON (sternly) Oh, Carter! A young man looks up quickly. He is  smoking a cigarette. CARTER Yes sir? DICKSON You know the rules about smoking . .  . Carter quickly crushes out the cigarette.  Even as he does so, Dickson reaches  into his pocket and flips Carter a fresh  one, which Carter pockets for later. CARTER Thank you, sir. Now Dickson passes Matt's cage. DICKSON (catching Matt's attention) Oh, Matt! Matt looks up. Dickson tosses him a  wink, and Matt winks back. Dickson walks on towards his office.  CAMERA TRUCKS AHEAD OF HIM. On the way  he is greeted by his employees. AD-LIB FROM EMPLOYEES Good morning, Mr. Dickson. Etc., etc. DICKSON (pleasantly) Morning. Good morning He is joined by Bill Saunders, a friend  of his. Bill walks along with Dickson. BILL Hello, Tom. DICKSON (firmly, but pleasantly) You here again? What do you want? He does not stop. Continues his walk  toward his office. Bill along-side of  him. BILL (smiling) What do you suppose anybody wants? Money,  money, money! DICKSON Listen, I told you I wasn't interested  in that deal, didn't I? ? 117 ? BILL I want to know why . Dickson notices a man, a janitor without  a uniform, passing by. DICKSON (to the man) Wait a minute. Where's your uniform? JANITOR I haven't any. DICKSON You haven't got a uniform? JANITOR No, sir. DICKSON My goodness, you ought to have a uniform.  How much does one cost? JANITOR Why, I don't know. DICKSON You see Sampson. Tell him I sent you.  You've got to have a uniform. The man exits scene. Bill picks up the  conversation where he left off. BILL Tom, I never had trouble getting credit  from you before. When I was flat broke  you gave me all the money I wanted.  Now I come to you with a swell deal,  and the greatest DICKSON (interrupting) I'll tell you why. I don't like the  crowd you're mixed up with. (softening) Personally, you can have all the credit  you want. But for that deal - not a  cent. BILL But listen, Tom, I They have now reached the anteroom of  Dickson's private chamber, where Helen  sits at her desk. 45. INT. DICKSON'S OUTER OFFICE - MED.  CLOSE SHOT As Dickson comes up to Helen at her  desk. A lady sits nearby. Dickson notices  her. DICKSON Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke. MRS. PEMBROKE Good morning, Mr. Dickson. DICKSON Got my letter? ? 118 ? MRS. PEMBROKE Yes, thank you. DICKSON Hello, Helen. HELEN Good morning. DICKSON Helen, you're becoming more beautiful  every day. What are we going to do about  it? HELEN I don't know. DICKSON Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the  bank. When are you and Matt going to  get married? HELEN (awkwardly) Why - well, I DICKSON Ummm. Stalling, eh? (changing tone, professionally) Anything new? HELEN Why, the directors are waiting for you  in the board room. DICKSON Directors, eh? Long faces? He gestures accordingly. HELEN (she trumps his gesture) Longer. DICKSON (half-under his breath) I haven't got any new stories for them  this morning, either. Mrs. Pembroke has been standing by,  waiting to get a word in edgewise. CAMERA  PANS SLIGHTLY with him to take in the  lady: MRS. PEMBROKE Mr. Dickson? DICKSON Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer  at the Guaranty. He's going to take  care of that mortgage for you . . . During this speech the phone bell rings. 46. MEDIUM SHOT As Helen picks up the phone and quietly  answers it. Bill Saunders is standing  nearby, still waiting to talk to Dickson  again. ? 119 ? HELEN (into phone) Hello . . . (she turns to Dickson) Mrs. Dickson on the phone. Dickson comes over to the desk and as  he picks up the receiver, he looks toward  Mrs. Pembroke. DICKSON (to Mrs. Pembroke) You'd better hurry over there. He's  waiting for you. (then into phone) Hello, dear . . . 47. CLOSE SHOT - DICKSON As he continues, into phone: DICKSON Where are you? . . . Sure, well, come  on down right away. Huh? . . . Yes,  of course I remember. It's tonight. (smiles) See what a social hound I'm becoming!  . . . All right, goodbye, dear. He hangs up. Mrs. Pembroke is waiting  for him to finish. She has apparently  been disappointed in the news he has  for her. MRS. PEMBROKE But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were  going to take care of the mortgage.  I only want ten thousand. The property  is worth sixty. DICKSON (ill-at-ease) Mr. Schaffer will take good care of  you. He'll give you fifteen - maybe  twenty . . . 48. MED. CLOSE SHOT He continues talking to the lady, trying  to get rid of her. DICKSON Better hurry now. Goodbye. Good luck  to you! Mrs. Pembroke, bewildered, starts to  leave. MRS. PEMBROKE (muttering) Thank you. CAMERA PANS WITH HIM as Mrs. Pembroke  leaves. DICKSON (to Helen) Oh, if Mrs. Dickson comes in, will you  tell her to see Cluett if she needs  any money? Bill Saunders is still waiting. He corners  Dickson. BILL What's the idea of turning her down?  It sounds like a perfectly safe investment. ? 120 ? DICKSON She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages  from widows. BILL (puzzled) Why not? 49. CLOSE SHOT OF THE TWO Shooting toward Dickson. DICKSON If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose,  won't I? BILL (dumbly) Yes - sure DICKSON (mimicking him) Yeah - sure! He turns to address a man below - the  janitor without a uniform. DICKSON Oh, make that uniform blue. JANITOR Yes, sir. Abruptly, he heads for the board room.  Bill is still baffled by Dickson's queer  reasoning. Suddenly, it dawns on him.  He shakes his head admiringly. CUT TO: 50. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MED. SHOT Dickson enters. DICKSON (blithely; as he counts the board members  present) One - two - three - four - five. Seven  more and you'd have a jury! He grabs a walking cane and wields it  like a golf putter. DICKSON Well, it's a nice morning, gentlemen.  How about two foursomes of golf? IVES (eagerly) Oh, I say, that would be . . . Ives's voice trails off as he realizes  Clark is scowling at him. DICKSON (undeterred; still practicing his golf  swing) Say, you know, I found out something  yesterday about hitting a golf ball.  You've got to hit with the left hand,  and from the inside out, it's the only  way you can hit anything ? 121 ? CLARK (huffy) I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like  to have a little of your very valuable  time here at the bank this morning,  if you don't mind. DICKSON Oh, you would, eh? All right. If it's  more important than golf, go ahead.  What's on your mind? CUT TO: 51. INT. LOBBY OF BANK - LONG SHOT Shooting from one end of the lobby toward  the front door. Depositors are scattered  all over the place. Some at the windows.  Some at the writing tables. Others sitting  inside the railing, talking to junior  executives. The scene is peaceful, though  very active. CAMERA STARTS TRUCKING FORWARD, passing  en route, the different types of individuals  who frequent the bank. People from all  walks of life. CAMERA TRAVELS SLOWLY,  picking up following little scenes. TELLER (at window) The check is no good. SADIE (A FEMALE CUSTOMER) What? CLERK The check is no good. The man has no  account here. SADIE Holy mackerel! I've been robbed. CLERK I'm sorry, madam. SADIE So am I. And don't call me madam! CAMERA NEXT PICKS UP an elderly lady  talking to a bank guard. GUARD Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money  here. LADY Is it safe? GUARD Absolutely. LADY It's his life insurance money, you know. BANK GUARD That's all right. You come with me,  and I'll show you where to deposit your  money. CAMERA GOES PAST and now singles out  three men who are coming forward. One  glance and we know they are here for  no kosher reason. ? 122 ? They are typical gangster types. One  of them, the leader, is dressed in everything  but the kitchen sink. Light fedora,  stiff shirt and collar with stripes  running perpendicularly. Flashy gray  suit - spats - and walking stick. The  other two are just tough hombres, but  dressed to kill. As they walk toward camera, they glance  around the bank with a professional  casualness, but obviously very much  impressed. Their eyes rove around the  place and finally land on some object  where they stop. CUT TO: 52. CLOSEUP - CHARLIE As he quickly counts out several thousand  dollars in bills. CUT TO: 53. CLOSE SHOT - THREE RACKETEERS Their eyes glisten. Their mouths water,  as they watch Charlie off scene. CUT TO: 54. MEDIUM SHOT Inside the railing. Cluett emerges from  his office and starts forward, business-like,  when he suddenly stops in his tracks. 55. CLOSEUP - CLUETT He stares off at the racketeers. A look  of fright comes into his eyes. His impulse  is to turn back. 56. CLOSE GROUP SHOT The three gangsters. A quick flash.  Their eyes light on Cluett off scene,  and they glare menacingly at him. LEADER There he is! Good morning! 57. MED. CLOSE SHOT - CLUETT He changes his mind about avoiding them.  His face breaks into a feeble smile  of affability as he walks toward them.  CAMERA PANS WITH HIM as he approaches  the three men, his hand outstretched  in forced amiability. CLUETT (shaking) Good morning! Who do you want to see? The gangsters shake hands with him,  their expressions remaining unchanged,  which adds immeasurably to Cluett's  discomfort. LEADER (flatly) You. 1ST GANGSTER (drawling) Yeah. We wanna talk to you about a big  deal. There is a sinister significance in  the manner in which he emphasizes \"a  big deal.\" Cluett is perceptibly ill-at-ease. ? 123 ? CLUETT (uncertainly - sickly smile) Oh, yes. Well, come right this way. He opens the swinging gate in front  of him, permitting the three racketeers  to enter. They start for Cluett's office. 58. INT. ANTE ROOM DICKSON'S OFFICE  - MED. CLOSE SHOT Helen sits at her typewriter near a  railing, overlooking the bank below.  Another girl stands by her, both are  staring off scene. CUT TO: 59. INT. BANK LOBBY - MED. LONG SHOT From Helen's angle. Cluett and the three gangsters going  into Cluett's office. 60. INT. ANTE ROOM OF DICKSON'S OFFICE  - MED. CLOSE SHOT Helen and other secretary. HELEN Hey Pat, come here! Look! SECRETARY (to Helen) That's Dude Finlay, all right - I've  seen his picture in the papers hundreds  of times. HELEN I wonder what he's doing with Mr. Cluett. SECRETARY (still staring - thrilled - shuddering) Gee, I'm scared. He's one of the toughest  gangsters in town. CUT TO: 61. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MED. LONG  SHOT Shooting down the length of the table.  The men are all sitting around the large  table. Dickson is on his feet. DICKSON (firmly) Gentlemen, you're only wasting your  time. There'll be no merger. 62. MED. CLOSE SHOT As Dickson continues. DICKSON (the injustice kills him) Why should I turn this bank over to  anybody else? I've worked twenty-five  years night and day to build it up,  and now you're asking me to dump it  into somebody's lap (with finality) Nothing doing! Schultz, who is seated near Dickson,  looks up at him: SCHULTZ You can make a handsome profit on your  stock. ? 124 ? DICKSON I'm not interested in profits. I'm interested  in the bank. In the depositors. They're  my friends. They're looking to me for  protection, and I'm not walking out  on them. Clark and O'Brien, also seated around  close to Dickson. CLARK How are you protecting your depositors?  By making a lot of idiotic loans! O'BRIEN (admonishing him) Take it easy, Clark. Ives, seated next to Schultz, becomes  alarmed. IVES (still trying) My dear friends . . . DICKSON (unruffled, paying no attention to Ives) It's all right. Let him go ahead. Let  him speak his piece. I like it. Go on. CLARK All right. I'll speak my piece. Dickson,  you've got to change your policy. 63. CLOSER SHOT As Dickson retorts: DICKSON What's the matter with my policy? How  many losses has this bank taken in the  last twenty-five years? (he looks around - silence) I'll tell you. Not a single one! (defiantly) What's wrong with that kind of banking? CLARK (mumbles disdainfully) Just pure luck! 64. CLOSE SHOT Ames, seated beyond Ives, now speaks  up: AMES Conditions have changed. These are precarious  times. Banks today have got to be careful.  And you've been more liberal than ever. Dickson's voice comes in over scene: DICKSON'S VOICE Yes, and I'm going to continue to be  liberal . . . 65. CLOSEUP - DICKSON As he continues: ? 125 ? DICKSON The trouble with this country today  is there's too much hoarded cash. Idle  money is no good to industry. Where  is all the money today? In the banks,  vaults, socks, old tin cans, buried  in the ground! I tell you, we've got  to get the money in circulation before  you'll get this country back to prosperity. 66. CLOSE SHOT - CLARK CLARK Who are we going to give it to? Men  like Jones? Last week you made him an  extra loan of fifty thousand dollars.  Do you call that intelligent banking? 67. CLOSE SHOT - SCHULTZ AND DICKSON SCHULTZ He can't pay his bills. How do you expect  him to pay us? DICKSON That's a fair question, Schultz. Now  let's see how bad a risk Jones is. What's  his history? He's been a successful  business man for thirty-five years.  Two years ago business started falling  off. Today Jones needs money, and if  he doesn't get it, he goes into bankruptcy  and throws nine hundred men out of work.  Answer - unemployment. 68. CLOSEUP - O'BRIEN As he listens intently, Dickson's voice  coming in: DICKSON'S VOICE It also means his creditors aren't paid.  They're in trouble. They go to banks  and are turned down . . . more bankruptcies  . . . 69. CLOSEUP - DICKSON As he continues: DICKSON It's a vicious circle, my friends, and  the only place to cure it is right here  at the source. Help Jones and you help  the whole circle. Now, when Jones comes  to me, I ask myself two questions. First  - is he honest? Yes. Second - is he  as good a business man as he was before?  And the answer is - he's better . 70. CLOSEUP - CLARK Showing his reaction, as part of Dickson's  speech comes over scene: DICKSON'S VOICE He is not only older and wiser, but  his present trouble has taught him precaution.  In my estimation, gentlemen, Jones is  no risk. Neither are the thousands of  other Joneses throughout the country  . . . ? 126 ? 71. CLOSEUP - SCHULTZ To intercut with Dickson's speech. 72. CLOSEUP - AMES To intercut with Dickson's speech. 73. CLOSEUP - IVES To intercut with Dickson's speech. 74. MED. CLOSE SHOT The group, as Dickson concludes his  speech. DICKSON It's they who built this nation up to  the richest in the world, and it's up  to the banks to give them a break. Disraeli  said security is the prosperity of the  nation[4] AMES (cutting him off) Why, Disraeli didn't say anything of  the kind. DICKSON Well, he should have said it. It's as  true now as it was then. And let us  get the right kind of security. Not  stocks and bonds that zig-zag up and  down, not collateral on paper, but character! CLARK (indignantly) Character, hmmpf! That's your idea? DICKSON Not at all. That's Alexander Hamilton's  idea[5] - the finest banking mind this  country has ever known. Those are his  exact words, gentlemen. Character! It's  the only thing you can bank on, and  it's the only thing that will pull this  country out of the doldrums. CUT TO: 75. INT. CLUETT'S PRIVATE OFFICE - MED.  CLOSE SHOT Cluett sits at his desk, his face drawn,  panic-stricken. He is like an animal  at bay. The leader of the trio, Dude  Finlay, sits in a chair directly in  front of Cluett. The other two men stand  on either side of the desk. DUDE (menacingly) You know what we do to welchers, Cluett,  don't you? CLUETT (trembling) I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have  been crazy! I lost my head completely! DUDE That's your funeral. We've got fifty  thousand dollars comin' to us. ? 127 ? CLUETT (helplessly) I haven't got it. 76. CLOSE SHOT - DUDE Shooting past Cluett. DUDE (barking) Then what did you want to gamble for?  If you'd have beat us out of fifty G's,  you'd have been paid, wouldn't you?  Well, we want our dough. CLUETT I'm sorry, Dude, butI DUDE That don't do us any good. CLUETT But after all, you can't take blood  from a stone. DUDE (threateningly - quietly) We can take blood from anything  (pauses) If it's comin' to us. 77. MED. CLOSE SHOT Shooting toward Cluett. Dude on opposite  side of desk, the other two men still  standing by the desk. A look of alarm spreads over Cluett's  face. There is nothing hidden in this  threat. CLUETT (wants time to think) Perhaps if you'll wait a little while,  I might be able ONE OF THE MEN (snappily) We waited long enough! DUDE (shrewdly - to the men) Nix. Lay off. (to Cluett) Now - what's the use of getting excited,  Cluett? It oughta be easy for you to  lay your mitts on that kind of dough  . . . 78. CLOSE SHOT - CLUETT Shooting past Dude, as Dude continues,  slowly, deliberately: DUDE There's plenty of it in this bank -  laying around loose. Cluett looks up - horror-stricken. ? 128 ? CLUETT (pop-eyed, choked voice) Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting  that I DUDE Why not? CLUETT (perspiring freely) Why, I couldn't do that . . . ! DUDE (flatly) You don't have to do nothing. Cluett looks up toward the men - then  at Dude. CLUETT (slowly) What do you mean? DUDE All you gotta do is fix a few things  for us , and we'll do the rest, see? There is a pause while Cluett stares  at them, horrified, his confused mind  trying to assimilate the ghastliness  of their proposal. Suddenly he starts  to rise. 79. MEDIUM SHOT As Cluett gets to his feet and faces  Dude across the desk. CLUETT No, no, I couldn't - I couldn't do anything  like that. I Smack! The rest of his speech dies in  his throat. The man to his right has  slapped him across the face with his  open palm. Taken unaware, Cluett's hand  goes to his cheek. He stares at them,  bewildered and frightened. Cluett, feeling himself trapped and  helpless, slowly sinks into his chair. CUT TO: 80. INT. ANTEROOM DICKSON'S OFFICE -  MED. SHOT Helen sits at her typewriter. A very  dignified, beautiful woman of thirty  approaches her. She is Phyllis Dickson,  Dickson's wife. She radiates refinement  and culture. MRS. DICKSON (pleasantly) Good morning, Helen. 81. CLOSER SHOT At Helen's desk, as Helen looks up at  Mrs. Dickson. HELEN How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson. MRS. DICKSON Is that busy husband of mine busy? ? 129 ? HELEN (indicating conference room) He's at a board meeting. MRS. DICKSON (not unexpected) Board meeting. Oh, that means hours,  I suppose. HELEN I'm afraid so. MRS. DICKSON Helen, did you ever try competing with  a bank? HELEN No. MRS. DICKSON Well, take my word for it, and don't  try it. It's useless! If it were some  other woman, I could handle her, but  after all, you can't scratch a bank's  eyes out now, can you? HELEN Hardly. 82. CLOSE SHOT - MRS. DICKSON Shooting past Helen. MRS. DICKSON Oh, well. I guess the only other thing  for me to do is to go out and buy myself  a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes  out, you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't  gotten rid of me! HELEN All right. 83. MEDIUM SHOT Helen laughs as Mrs. Dickson leaves  in the direction of Cluett's office. CUT TO: 84. INT. CYRIL CLUETT'S OFFICE - MED.  CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR The three racketeers are preparing to  leave. Dude has his hand on the doorknob. CLUETT (nervously) Dude - there's not any chance of my  becoming involved in this, is there? DUDE You? No, you'll be all right, so long  as you establish an alibi for tonight. CLUETT I know, but DUDE Be sure you're with somebody responsible  in case any questions are asked. Understand? ? 130 ? CLUETT But Dude, listen - couldn't we make  this some other time? DUDE (positively) Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty  easy. Quit squawking! Cluett looks at Dude, then at the others,  and realizes he is helpless. He opens the door and the men file out,  silently. Cluett shuts the door and  CAMERA PANS WITH HIM as he crosses back  to his desk, shaking perceptibly. He  reaches into a desk drawer and extracts  a bottle of liquor. As he takes a drink, Mrs. Dickson enters  unannounced. CUT TO: 85. MED. CLOSE SHOT As Mrs. Dickson stands watching Cluett. MRS. DICKSON (playful reproach) Oh, oh! Cluett turns quickly. Upon seeing her,  he makes an attempt to conceal the terror  he feels. CLUETT (smiling feebly) Oh, hello, Phyllis. She advances toward him as he rises. MRS. DICKSON (shaking her head) This won't do. Not during business hours  . . . CLUETT Why, I needed a (offering her drink) Want one? MRS. DICKSON (screwing up her face) Heavens, no! Do you mind putting up  with me until the financial genius gets  thru genius-ing? CLUETT No, no, of course not. Not at all. Oh,  here. As she takes out a cigarette, he offers  her a light. Mrs. Dickson notices that  he is rather nervous. MRS. DICKSON What is the matter with you? You're  trembling? 86. CLOSE SHOT - CLUETT CLUETT (trying to be light) Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason  why I should be, unless of course it's  you . . . ? 131 ? 87. CLOSE TWO SHOT MRS. DICKSON Me? CLUETT Being alone with you has always done  this to me. You know that. MRS. DICKSON For a celebrated bounder, that is an  awful admission. Besides, I never knew  that any female could do this to you  . CLUETT Well, you can. You always could. MRS. DICKSON (smiling) Liar! You're just suffering from lack  of sleep. He takes this as premature defeat, and  heads back toward his desk. MRS. DICKSON (good-natured admonishment) Here, here, here, now! Don't you go  back to work on me, too. I'm getting  tired of this. Besides, it's beginning  to affect your looks CLUETT (not understanding) What is? MRS. DICKSON (finishing her little joke) running around. Not your work. (Cluett laughs in relief) You'd better start reforming, Cyril! CLUETT If I thought you were the slightest  bit interested, I would. MRS. DICKSON Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know  something? I've always been curious  about your line. CLUETT Line? MRS. DICKSON Whatever it is that makes you such a  riot with women. He shrugs off the compliment. MRS. DICKSON (continuing) Come on Cyril, try a little bit of it  out on me. I haven't had any first-class  blarney thrown at me since the day I  was married. ? 132 ? CLUETT (trying hard) But you see, it isn't blarney where  you're concerned. MRS. DICKSON (laughs) Now let me see, what comes next? (a mocking tone) Oh yes, I know - what are you doing  tonight, Phyllis? 88. CLOSEUP - CLUETT He is suddenly reminded of his pact  with Dude Finlay. Terror returns to  his face. CLUETT Tonight? He suddenly gets an idea. He was told  to be with someone around midnight.  Someone who would be an alibi for him.  He stares off at Phyllis Dickson. Why  not? MRS. DICKSON (continuing) Doesn't that come next? 89. MED. CLOSE SHOT CLUETT Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing  tonight, Phyllis? MRS. DICKSON See, we're getting along famously! CUT TO: 90. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MEDIUM SHOT Clark is in a state of agitation. The  other directors seem worn by the ordeal.  Dickson remains adamant. DICKSON Most of the creditors I know personally.  I've seen them grow up in the community.  I knew their fathers and mothers before  them. CLARK I know, Dickson. That's all very well.  But you're taking too many chances.  In these times a bank should keep liquid  in case of trouble. In case of emergency! 91. CLOSER SHOT AT THE TABLE All the men in the scene. DICKSON I know what you mean by that. You want  me to hang on to our cash. Well, I don't  believe in it. The law demands that  I carry a certain legal reserve, and  I'm doing it. The rest of our money  is out working . . . working to help  industry . . . to help build up business  . . . ? 133 ? 92. CLOSEUP - CLARK As he almost shouts at Dickson. CLARK In the meantime, you're jeopardizing  the safety of the bank. Well, we won't  stand for it! 93. MED. CLOSE SHOT Of the group, as Dickson turns to Clark. DICKSON You have to stand for it. Meek little Ives once again tries to  say something: IVES (exhausted) But my dear friends . . . SCHULTZ (interrupting) You're forcing us to take action against  you, Dickson. Dickson looks at him: DICKSON Go ahead - take all the action you want! He looks about at the others as he continues: DICKSON I'm running this bank my way. Get that  clear! CLARK Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses  to consider our wishes. He refuses an  offer to merge with the New York Trust  - the only thing that will put this  bank on safe ground. He insists upon  running a bank on so flimsy a thing  as . . . as faith! DICKSON Yes! You said it, Clark. That's the  only thing that means anything to me. 94. CLOSEUP - CLARK As Dickson's voice continues. Clark  reacts appropriately. DICKSON'S VOICE Before I take a man into this bank,  and before I extend credit to anyone,  I satisfy myself on one thing - do I  believe in him? 95. CLOSE PAN SHOT On the other men - CAMERA PANNING from  one to the other as Dickson's voice  comes over the shot - finally CAMERA  STOPS on Dickson. DICKSON So far, my judgement has been right  one hundred per cent. One hundred per  cent! When I start going wrong, you  won't have to take any action. I'll  turn the bank over to you. Then you  can ? 134 ? merge all you want to. I won't be the  fellow to run it then. Good day, gentlemen! He exits scene. CAMERA TRUCKS AHEAD OF HIM as Dickson  passes briskly through his outer office,  stopping only to speak to Helen at her  desk: DICKSON (cheerfully) Helen, tell Matt I want to see him. HELEN Yes, sir. CUT TO: 96. INT. CLUETT'S PRIVATE OFFICE - CLOSE  SHOT - CLUETT AND PHYLLIS CLUETT (mid-stream) and after dinner, we could go MRS. DICKSON (not at all angry) Oh! Oh, no! I think I've done enough  experimenting for one day. Congratulations,  Cyril. You've convinced me that you're  a philanderer of the very first order.  I shall recommend you highly. CLUETT (simply) Please, please don't laugh at me, Phyllis.  I must see you tonight! 97. CLOSER SHOT OF THE TWO Favoring Mrs. Dickson. MRS. DICKSON Tonight, Oh, never! Tonight I have reserved  for a very special occasion. Believe  it or not, it's our wedding anniversary.  Tom doesn't probably even remember it.  But then, they never do, do they? CLUETT'S VOICE No, they don't She shakes her head. MRS. DICKSON But I'm giving a party for him - a real,  old-fashioned surprise party. Caps,  bells, whistles, and everything. I'm  really terribly excited about it. I've  been planning it for months. CLUETT (after a pause) Well MRS. DICKSON (smiling) Well, what? ? 135 ? CLUETT (he won't give up) Well, aren't you going to invite me? MRS. DICKSON (surprised) You? No can do. It's all set. Just a  few of Tom's closest friends. CLUETT Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me,  I'm coming anyway. MRS. DICKSON Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable  people. They'd probably bore you to  death. CLUETT (desperate-sounding) No, they won't. Not when you are there.  Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me. MRS. DICKSON (flattered, but a little suspicious) Why are you so anxious? CLUETT (intense sincerity) Don't you know? MRS. DICKSON No. CLUETT I want to be near you! He steps closer to her. MRS. DICKSON What? CLUETT Don't you know I've been crazy about  you for years? MRS. DICKSON (still flattered, lightly) Now wait a minute, wait a minute . .  . CLUETT I've loved you ever since I can remember,  long before you married Tom Dickson. MRS. DICKSON (still only half-believing) Why, Cyril, you're insane CLUETT No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided  you. I was afraid of making a fool of  myself. But I won't stand it any longer MRS. DICKSON Cyril! ? 136 ? Before she realizes what has happened,  he has swept her into his arms and crushes  her to him. CAMERA PANS AWAY from them  to the door to the outer office. The  door opens and Matt steps in. He stops,  suddenly, transfixed by what he sees  off scene. 98. MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT Phyllis Dickson in Cluett's arms (from  Matt's angle). They suddenly become  conscious of someone in the room and  Phyllis struggles free, looking off  scene toward Matt: CUT TO: 99. CLOSE SHOT - MATT From Cluett and Mrs. Dickson's angle. He stares unbelievingly for a moment,  and then collecting himself, turns and  leaves the room, closing the door after  him. CAMERA PANS BACK to Cluett and  Mrs. Dickson. For a moment she is terribly  upset. CLUETT Please forgive me, Phyllis. I lost my  head for a minute. But I couldn't help  it, Phyllis. As she starts for the door, CAMERA PANS  WITH HER. Cluett walks with her. MRS. DICKSON Please stop apologizing so much. You're  making it far too important. As they reach the door. CUT TO: 100. INT. ANTE ROOM OF CLUETT'S OFFICE  - MED. SHOT Matt stands there, in a daze. Cluett's  secretary is not there. He starts slowly  forward, hardly knowing where he is  going - CAMERA TRUCKING AHEAD OF HIM  - there is a far-away look in his eyes.  His hand clutches the list of payrolls  but as far as he is concerned, it is  entirely forgotten. Several people talk  to him, but Matt walks on heedlessly.  He can't get over the shock of what  he just saw. He always had been under  the impression that Dickson's home life  was a happy one. He never dreamed that  Phyllis Dickson represented anything  but the height of circumspection. And  now - Cyril Cluett, of all people! Helen comes running into scene, all  excited. HELEN (happily) Matt, where have you been? Mr. Dickson  wants to see you right away. Hurry up! He turns around mechanically and continues  to walk in the direction of Dickson's  office - CAMERA TRUCKING AFTER HIM.  Helen falls into step with him. HELEN Say, I just heard the merger isn't going  thru. Isn't that grand? ? 137 ? MATT (tonelessly) Yeah, swell. They reach Dickson's outer office. Matt  crosses it and exits into the private  office. Helen looks after him - her  face falls in disappointment. Matt is  acting very strangely. She thought he'd  be elated. She stares unhappily at his  forlorn figure as it disappears thru  the door. CUT TO: 101. INT. DICKSON'S PRIVATE OFFICE -  MED. SHOT Dickson sits at his desk when Matt enters.  When he sees Matt, his face breaks into  a broad, pleasant smile. DICKSON (grandly) Well, Matt, get ready for the big moment.  Starting tomorrow you become assistant  cashier. How's that? Matt crosses to the desk as Dickson  is speaking. 102. CLOSE SHOT AT DESK As Matt stops in front of Dickson. Matt  cannot share Dickson's enthusiasm. The  scene he just witnessed has taken the  joy out of everything. MATT It's all right. Thanks. DICKSON And what's more, keep up the good work  and who knows - some day you'll be the  fellow sitting behind that desk . .  . (the idea pleases him) Not a bad thought, eh? He suddenly notices Matt's lack of enthusiasm. 103. CLOSE SHOT OF THE TWO Shooting toward Dickson. He leans forward to look at Matt closely: DICKSON What's the matter? You don't seem very  excited about it. MATT (feebly) Sure, I think it's swell. DICKSON (scrutinizing him closely, very much  hurt) Say, come on. Show a little enthusiasm.  What's the matter? Are you sick or something?  Go on, fake it - even if it isn't real. 104. CLOSE SHOT - MATT Shooting past Dickson. Matt makes an attempt to snap out of  it - and answers quickly. ? 138 ? MATT Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just  kind of sudden, that's all. (working up a little enthusiasm) Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great.  Only, well, you've done so much for  me already . . . I'll never be able  to thank you enough. 105. MEDIUM SHOT DICKSON Aw, go on, forget it. You came through,  didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot  of them didn't think you would. You  don't know how much satisfaction it's  been to me. It's been swell. Well, when  are you and Helen going to get married? MATT Well, I DICKSON I suppose you want me to fix that up  for you too, eh? They are interrupted by the sudden appearance  of Phyllis Dickson. Both men look up  as she appears in the door. 106. CLOSE SHOT - MRS. DICKSON As she stops in doorway. She glances  fearfully, first at Matt and then at  her husband, trying to sense whether  Matt has said anything. She is quickly  assured by Dickson's affable greeting. 107. MED. CLOSE SHOT As Dickson comes toward her, arms extended: DICKSON Well, look who's here! Hello, dear. MRS. DICKSON Hello, darling. He kisses her. Then throws his arms  around her for an exaggerated \"teddybear\"  hug. Over Dickson's shoulder, Phyllis  looks gratefully at Matt. 108. CLOSE SHOT - MATT He returns her glance. His eyes are  unable to disguise his contempt. 109. MED. CLOSE SHOT Dickson and Phyllis. He releases her. DICKSON If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom  Dickson! First I trample on the Board  of Directors, then I promote Matt here  to assistant cashier, and now to complete  the day I have a visit from my sweet  and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a  man, what a man! MRS. DICKSON (with a half-smile) It's amazing that your sweet, lovely,  gorgeous wife can ever get to see you. ? 139 ? DICKSON Oooh! That has the earmarks! He notices Matt, still standing there,  uncomfortably. DICKSON (good-naturedly) Are you still here? Go on - go to work!  What do you think I pay you for? Matt exits. CUT TO: 110. INT. ANTE ROOM OF DICKSON'S PRIVATE  OFFICE - MEDIUM SHOT As Matt comes out and moves quickly  forward as if anxious to get away from  the embarrassing situation he found  himself in. Helen, upon seeing him,  jumps up. HELEN (excitedly) What happened? What did he say? Did  you get the job? MATT (dolefully) Yeah. 111. CLOSE TWO SHOT She is perplexed by his unenthusiastic  attitude. HELEN What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought  you'd be thrilled to death. MATT Come here. (he takes her aside) You know, a few minutes ago I was in  Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was  there. HELEN Well . . . ? MATT Well, he was making love to her. Helen, although she had a vague suspicion,  is shocked. HELEN (after a pause) Oh Matt, you must be mistaken. MATT I tell you, I saw them! Helen stares at him, horrified. HELEN In Cluett's office? MATT Yes, right in his office, the rat. I'd  like to take a crack at that guy. ? 140 ? A telephone rings.

Dickson  can't help but notice. DICKSON What's the matter dear? What have I  done now? MRS. DICKSON Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going  out with me tonight. DICKSON Oh, I did have a date with you tonight,  didn't I? MRS. DICKSON Yes. DICKSON I'm terribly sorry. I'd forgotten all  about you. I'm so sorry, dear. 113. CLOSE SHOT OF THE TWO Favoring Phyllis Dickson. MRS. DICKSON Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia  tonight. That's all there is to it. DICKSON But I have to go, dear. It's a very  important banker's meeting. ? 141 ? MRS. DICKSON (interrupting) I don't care whether it's important  or not. You said you were going out  with me, and if you hadn't promised  so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone  and planned the whole thing. DICKSON Listen, it isn't so terribly important.  We can go to the theatre any time. MRS. DICKSON The theatre? 114. MED. CLOSE SHOT DICKSON That's what it was you planned, wasn't  it? MRS. DICKSON (after a slight hesitation) Yes, of course. DICKSON You can take some of the girls. You  can take Mildred - or Gwynn MRS. DICKSON The girls!

Ho! Ho! MRS. DICKSON Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh  if I were you. You may not suspect it,  but I'm still attractive - to some. DICKSON Listen, don't go around being attractive  to anyone but me . . . MRS. DICKSON Well . . . DICKSON Don't you forget that I'm still the  head man around here too. Now we'll  get the tickets changed for tomorrow  night. You and I are going out together.  How's that? MRS. DICKSON Tomorrow night? A buzzer sounds, and a visitor is announced  on the intercom. DICKSON Yes? ? 142 ? VOICE Mr. Gardner's here. DICKSON (answering the intercom) Oh, yes. That's that lawyer. All right,  let him have nine thousand. (returning attention to his wife) Yes sir, I'll step you around this town  like you've never stepped before. We  will have dinner at the St. Regis -  then we'll go to a nice, snappy show  - then a nightclub - we'll listen to  soft music, and who knows? Ha! - I might  break down and dance with you! MRS. DICKSON (still skeptical) All right. I'll postpone the whole thing  until tomorrow night. DICKSON (assuringly) Happy now? MRS. DICKSON (mock-pouting) No. 116. MEDIUM SHOT He takes her in his arms and kisses  her. DICKSON (tenderly) Poor kid, you know, I have been neglecting  you. MRS. DICKSON Oh, I don't care, darling. I love you,  anyway. A buzzer sounds again, and Dickson answers  the intercom. DICKSON Yes? HELEN'S VOICE Mr. Sampson . . . DICKSON All right. Send him in. There is a knock on the door. Dickson  moves away from his wife. He looks toward  the door. 117. CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR Sampson, an executive in the bank, enters.  Sampson goes to Dickson with some papers  in his hand. He lays the papers on the  desk before Dickson. DICKSON Well, Sampson, what is it? SAMPSON Here's the data on the Clyde deal. ? 143 ? 118. CLOSE SHOT AT DESK Dickson is all absorbed. DICKSON Good. I'll take this along with me.  Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm  sick and tired of the delay. SAMPSON I'm afraid he's been stalling. DICKSON That's just exactly what he has been  doing. This deal should have been closed  weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow  open . . . SAMPSON He says he can't get away in the daytime. DICKSON How about his nights? He's too busy  running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow  night open, come in and sign this thing,  or I'll call this whole deal off. SAMPSON Yes, sir. 120. CLOSEUP - PHYLLIS DICKSON She stands by a window, listening. There  is despair in her look as she hears  him making arrangements for tomorrow  night. Dickson's voice comes over this  shot: DICKSON'S VOICE I'm sick and tired of these people dilly-dallying.  People who can't make up their minds  . . . Mrs. Dickson's eyes close hopelessly,  and she feels defeated. Again shut out  from his scheme of things, she realizes  he is incurable.

HELEN What's keeping you? MATT Oh, Charlie again. HELEN Say Matt, you haven't done anything  about what you saw today, have you? MATT (still upset) Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like  to take a crack at that stiff-necked,  horse dollar.[6] HELEN Oh now, don't be silly. MATT (disgusted) Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing  her. HELEN Now you've got me worried, dear. (she kisses him) Promise me you won't butt in. MATT Okay, honey - but just the same I'd  like to take a crack at that She puts her hand over her mouth: HELEN Shh . . . ! (whispering) I'll wait for you upstairs. MATT All right, dear. She leaves. Matt remains standing, a  far-away look in his eyes. It is obvious  he is thinking about the thing seriously. ? 145 ? 124. MEDIUM SHOT The boys who were inside the vault now  file out, having properly locked away  their cash. At the same time, Charlie  wheels in his truck. MATT (kidding him) Where you been? CHARLIE (annoyed) Where do you think I've been? (pointing to truck) I took the baby for a stroll in the  park. The men hurry out of sight, laughing.  Charlie disappears into the vault. Matt  enters the vault, his mind still preoccupied. 125. INTERIOR VAULT MED. SHOT As Matt goes directly to the burglar  alarm.

Matt goes to the time clock to check  it up. He tinkers with it a moment. CUT TO: 126. OUTSIDE OF VAULT - MED. CLOSE SHOT Matt has just finished adjusting the  time clock as Charlie comes out of the  vault. MATT (pointing to time clock) And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend  time clock for exactly nine o'clock,  so no squawks out of you guys in the  morning. CHARLIE (as he exits) Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles  of my own. Matt smiles. He starts to shut the vault.  He has it swinging half-way around when  Cluett enters. When Matt sees Cluett,  the smile dies on his lips. ? 146 ? CLUETT Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow? MATT Yes, sir. CLUETT (peremptorily) Let me see your cash book, will you? MATT Now? CLUETT Yes, now. Matt looks at him a moment antagonistically.  He has half a mind to talk to him right  now, but he recalls Helen's admonitions  and thinks better of it. MATT All right, sir. He exits into vault. The moment he is  gone, Cluett crosses quickly to the  time clock. INSERT: TIME CLOCK As Cluett's gloved hand comes in and  turns the indicator back to 12 o'clock. 127. INTERIOR VAULT - MED. CLOSE SHOT Matt has opened a compartment and has  brought out several sheets of paper.  He goes thru them to find the one he  wants.

DICKSON (mock-melodramatic) I knew I couldn't trust you. You told  me you were taking me home. CLUETT Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll  have just one drink, then we'll go. MRS. DICKSON (definitely) No. I know the answer to that one. (shaking her head) I think you'd better take me home. CLUETT What's the matter? Afraid papa will  spank? 130. CLOSER SHOT ON THE TWO MRS. DICKSON No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much  interested. He's too busy rushing off  to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old  speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings.  Too busy closing big, important deals (on second thought) I think I will have a drink. CLUETT Good for you. Come on. LAP DISSOLVE TO: 131. INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE CLUETT'S  APT. - MED. CLOSE SHOT Cluett and Mrs. Dickson emerge from  the elevator and cross to his apartment,  CAMERA FOLLOWING THEM. Cluett fumbles  in his pocket for the key. ? 148 ? MRS. DICKSON You know, there ought to be a Congressional  Medal for men like you. America's comfort  to misunderstood wives. I never thought  I would find myself in that class. CLUETT Oh, you're not so badly off. There's  something much worse than being a misunderstood  wife. MRS. DICKSON What is that, Mr. Bones?[7] CLUETT A misunderstood bachelor. Cluett smiles. He has the door open  by now and stands aside to permit her  to enter. CUT TO: 132. INT. CLUETT'S APARTMENT - MED.  CLOSE SHOT At door. Phyllis Dickson has just stepped  in, and Cluett follows. He closes the  door and locks it. CLUETT (mock-melodramatic) And now fair woman, I have you in my  power. MRS. DICKSON (playing along) I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got  a moustache! CLUETT I'll grow a moustache by the time you  get out of here. CAMERA TRUCKS WITH THEM as he chases  her into the next room. She alights  on a piano bench, and runs her fingers  up and down the scales. Suddenly Cluett  stops. He stares off, a look of amazement  in his face. Mrs. Dickson turns and  follows his gaze and she, too, is startled. CAMERA PANS QUICKLY over to the other  side of the room. Matt sits on the edge  of a chair waiting for them. He rises,  looks off toward Cluett and Mrs. Dickson.  As he starts forward, CAMERA PANS BACK  to Cluett and Phyllis. MRS. DICKSON Why, Matt! CLUETT (when he recovers from his surprise) What are you doing here? Matt enters the scene. MATT The butler said I could stay. I told  him it was important. CLUETT Oh, yeah? ? 149 ? Cluett steps over to a bell cord and  pulls it. MATT He's not here. He left at nine o'clock.  He said you gave him the night off. Cluett wheels around, infuriated. CLUETT What do you want? 133. CLOSE SHOT OF THE TWO Favoring Matt. MATT (uncomfortably) Well, I thought I'd like to have a little  talk with you. CLUETT (sharply) I'm listening. MATT (hesitatingly) It's funny - now that I'm here, I don't  know just how to go about it. (a glance toward Mrs. Dickson) You see, I kind of expected to find  you here alone. As Cluett starts away: MATT Do you mind stepping outside? We could  talk 134. MEDIUM SHOT Cluett crosses to the door, where he  stands, ready to open it. Mrs. Dickson  stands by helplessly. CLUETT (a tone of dismissal) Anything you have to say to me, you  can say in the morning. MATT Oh no, Mr. Cluett, if it's all the same  to you, I'd rather not wait. It's about  you and Mrs. Dickson. Cluett releases his hold on the doorknob.  Mrs. Dickson looks at Matt uneasily  - she is quickly sobering. CLUETT (aghast) About me and . . . He crosses slowly toward Matt. PHYLLIS Why Matt, what are you talking about? ? 150 ? 135. CLOSER SHOT OF THE THREE MATT (quickly) I know I've got a lot of nerve butting  in like this, but I just couldn't help  it. I thought I could stop two people  from doing something they'd be sorry  for. CLUETT (livid) I'm not interested in what you think. MATT You've no right to do this to her, Mr.  Cluett. Why don't you think it over?  It's only gonna get you into a lot of  trouble. CLUETT I tell you, I'm not interested in your  opinion. MATT (turns to Phyllis) No? Then maybe you'll understand, Mrs.  Dickson. Oh, gee, he's crazy about you.  Nobody knows it better than you. If  he ever finds out, it'll kill him. MRS. DICKSON But Matt, you're mistaken about the  whole thing. There isn't anything wrong.  Mr. Cluett and I simply came here 136. CLOSE SHOT - MATT & CLUETT Shooting toward Matt. CLUETT (to Phyllis) Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything. (snappily, to Matt) You'd do well to mind your own business. MATT (wheeling on him) This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been  like a father to me. (his voice rising) What has he ever done to you to deserve  a deal like this? CLUETT (livid) That will be just about enough! Now  get out of here! MATT I guess I have said enough (bitterly) I'm just wasting my breath talking to  you. 137. WIDER ANGLE Taking in Mrs. Dickson, who stands slightly  apart from the two men. ? 151 ? CLUETT You're right for the first time. Now  get out! Matt ignores Cluett and looks toward  phyllis Dickson. MATT I'm appealing to you, Mrs. Dickson.  Think what you're doing to him. You're  passing up the whitest man on earth (flaring up) for a dirty, no-good. Before he finishes the sentence, Cluett  punches him. Matt, caught unawares,  is thrown off balance and sent reeling.  He drops between two chairs. Now, livid  with rage, he pulls himself up, murder  in his eyes. Cluett crosses quickly  to a desk near the door, opens a drawer  and extracts a revolver. MRS. DICKSON (frightened - cries out) Cyril! Matt, who was started toward Cluett,  stops in his tracks upon seeing the  gun. 138. CLOSE SHOT Shooting toward Cluett. CLUETT (under his breath) Now get out of here! CAMERA PANS WITH MATT to the door. MRS. DICKSON'S VOICE Wait a minute, Matt! Matt turns as she enters the scene. MRS. DICKSON I'll go with you. CLUETT'S VOICE But phyllis! Mrs. Dickson steps closer to Matt's  side. Cluett comes up to them. CLUETT You needn't go on account of this idiot. Matt has opened the door. MATT (quietly) You better carry that around with you  all the time - you're going to need  it. Matt follows Mrs. Dickson out, leaving  Cluett glaring after them. 139. INT. OF BANK - NIGHT A series of quick vignettes: Cluett's watch, showing 12:07. ? 152 ? A wall clock, showing 12:07. A night watchman, alerted by suspicious  noise, creeping up to the vault. The night watchman, shot by figures  in the shadows. A small number of men rush out of the  vault, clutching money bags and toting  guns. The night watchman, getting off a shot,  before he crumples to the floor. FADE OUT: FADE IN 140. INT. VAULT ROOM OF BANK - CLOSEUP  ON DOOR The vault door, partly opened. Over  the shot we hear excited murmurs. CAMERA STARTS TRUCKING BACK SLOWLY,  until it takes in the full room. A fingerprint  expert is working on the time clock  for finger-print impressions. The medical  examiner bends over the body of the  watchman, whose face is covered with  a cloth. A detective in charge of the  proceedings stands around, looking very  officious. DETECTIVE What do you say, Doc? DOCTOR Oh, I'd say about eight or nine hours. DETECTIVE Well, you'd better call the coroner. CAMERA CONTINUES TRUCKING BACK, until  it passes a group of tellers and clerks  in a huddle. They listen breathlessly  as Oscar, the youngest of the tellers,  relates his story. For the moment he  is the center of attraction, and he  revels in it. OSCAR (breathlessly) I was the first one to see it. I was  coming down the stairs, and there was  the dead watchman at my feet. You coulda  knocked me over with a pin. AD-LIB FROM LISTENERS (murmuring) Gee . . . Can you imagine . . . OSCAR Do you see that clock? Right there.  That's where the bullet hit. When I  saw that, you coulda knocked me over  with a pin. CLERK Was there much blood? OSCAR Blood! (gesturing toward body) Come on over fellas. I'll show you. The clerks head toward the dead body,  but are intercepted by the officious  detective. ? 153 ? DETECTIVE (officiously) Get back there . I don't want anything  touched until the Inspector gets here. The clerks, awe-stricken, retreat. CHARLIE (running up) Oscar, what's the matter? OSCAR I was the first one to see it. I was  coming down the stairs, and there was  the watchman lying dead at my feet. CHARLIE No kidding? OSCAR No kidding. When I saw it, you coulda  knocked me over with a pin. CHARLIE Where's Matt? OSCAR Matt? CHARLIE Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking  up a wise-crack for this one . . . OSCAR The detectives got Matt up there in  Sampson's office. CHARLIE He has? OSCAR Yeah. CLERK Say, did Matt do it? OSCAR Don't look at me. I don't know. TELLER Say, he did look kinda funny yesterday,  didn't you notice it? OTHERS Yeah, he did. I noticed it too.

The side of his  face is swollen from Cyril Cluett's  punch of the night before. ? 154 ? INSPECTOR'S VOICE (like a tri-hammer) Come on, come on. You might as well  tell me the truth. What did you do with  the money? MATT I didn't do it. I told you all I know,  Inspector. CAMERA TRUCKS BACK revealing the other  occupants of the room. The Inspector  leans over Matt, firing questions at  him. Two detectives are also there,  one at the door, the other near Matt.  Helen stands in a corner, pale and fearful,  looking on. INSPECTOR You turned off the burglar alarm, you  set the time clock, came back at twelve  and emptied the boxes, didn't you? MATT (rises in indignation) I wasn't anywhere near this place INSPECTOR (shoving him back down) Sit down! When the watchman surprised  you, you shot him - what'd you do with  the gun? MATT (desperately) I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun! INSPECTOR You used to carry a gun, didn't you? 142. MEDIUM SHOT Sampson enters hesitantly. SAMPSON Pardon me, but I'd like to use my office  for awhile! INSPECTOR (bellowing) You use some other office! Sampson exits scene hurriedly. CUT TO: 143. INT. LOBBY OF BANK AT ENTRANCE  - MED.

DICKSON Good morning, everybody. What's the  matter here? Open up the door. Come  on, open this door. GARDINER Shall we let the people come in? ? 155 ? DICKSON (snappily) Of course, let them in! You're late  now. CAMERA TRUCKS WITH DICKSON as he proceeds  toward interior of bank. Helen rushes  into the scene and up to him. CAMERA  STOPS. HELEN Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest  Matt. They think he did it! DICKSON Where is he now? HELEN In Mr. Sampson's office. DICKSON Now don't you worry about it. He crosses in that direction, followed  by Helen. CUT TO: 143. INT.

(to the Inspector) This is ridiculous! You can't hold this  boy on a vague suspicion. 145. CLOSER SHOT OF THE GROUP INSPECTOR I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson. DICKSON Why pick on him ? INSPECTOR It's an inside job. That's a cinch.  Whoever did it had a pretty good picture  of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in  charge of the vaults, isn't he? DICKSON Yes. ? 156 ? 146. CLOSEUP - MATT Over which comes Inspector's voice as  he continues: INSPECTOR'S VOICE The burglar alarm was turned off. The  time clock was set for 12 o'clock. What  more do you want? DICKSON'S VOICE Somebody else could have done it, couldn't  they? INSPECTOR'S VOICE He admits that he set the clock himself. Matt looks up toward inspector. MATT I did. I set it for nine o'clock this  morning. 147. MED. CLOSE SHOT - GROUP As the Inspector turns to Matt: INSPECTOR Then who changed it? MATT (helplessly) I don't know. DICKSON Wait a minute. Wait a minute. The Inspector turns back to Dickson. DICKSON What time did this thing happen? INSPECTOR The clock opposite the vault was stopped  by a bullet at 12:09. DICKSON All right. If the boy proves an alibi,  he's all right, isn't he? INSPECTOR If he can do it, yes. DICKSON Why, certainly he can. (to Matt) Matt, now all you've got to do is tell  them where you were last night, between  twelve and twelve-thirty, and everything  will be all right. MATT (averting Dickson's gaze) I already told him I was home. DICKSON (to Inspector) There you are. ? 157 ? INSPECTOR That's what he says. I got a man from  headquarters checking up on it now. DICKSON (confidently) Good. (to Matt, smiling) You've got nothing to worry about. Soon  as the report comes in, you'll be released. (to Inspector) And listen, don't talk so loud. Take  it easy. Coast a little. He exits scene. 148. INT. THE LOBBY OF THE BANK - FULL  SHOT Showing the normal activity of the bank  in contrast to the turmoil going on  inside. Just a few people scattered  about.

Oscar, the young teller, is relating  his story for the hundredth time. OSCAR Gee, what do you think? There was that  watchman, that poor watchman, lying  on the floor right in front of me. Oh,  you coulda knocked me over with a pin! OPERATOR (wide-eyed) You don't say! Dead? OSCAR Dead? He was lifeless! You know, I was  the first one to see him. I was coming  down the stairs, and there was the watchman  lying on the floor, right in front of  me. Dead!

Lines form  in front of all the windows. Depositors  crowd around the writing tables. There  are not ? 162 ? enough pens to go around. Frantic hands  reach over shoulders for withdrawal  blanks. CAMERA MOVES FORWARD. Over the  shot is heard the seething blend of  many voices. CAMERA STOPS ON a Teller and a Man. TELLER Closing your account? MAN Yes, sir. I'm closing my account. I  wouldn't leave a nickel in this bank. CAMERA STOPS ON a 2nd Man talking to  a Woman. 2ND MAN It's getting so a man's money ain't  safe unless it's in his sock.

He hurriedly exits scene. CUT TO: 159. INT. SAMPSON'S OFFICE - MED. SHOT Inspector is still holding his ground.  Matt sits dejectedly in the same place  as before. INSPECTOR (to Dickson) All I know is the bank's been robbed  and a murder's been committed. The way  I see it, Brown here looks guilty. 160. CLOSER SHOT ON GROUP DICKSON What are you talking about? He had no  more to do with it than you did. INSPECTOR Maybe. But I'm taking no chances. (emphatically) Why, this kid's got a record. DICKSON So have you. So have I. So's everybody  got a record. What difference does that  make? You can't go around pinning crimes  on people just because they He is interrupted by the sound of the  door opening. He looks off toward door. 161. CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR Sampson stands there, looking off toward  the group. SAMPSON Mr. Dickson! Can I see you for a minute? DICKSON'S VOICE No, I'm busy. See me later. SAMPSON But this is important, Mr. Dickson.  Looks like there's a run on the bank. 162. MED. CLOSE SHOT Dickson and the others. Dickson looks  off at Sampson, unbelievingly: DICKSON What? A run on the bank! CAMERA PANS WITH HIM as he rushes over  to the door to Sampson. ? 164 ? SAMPSON The lobby's half filled now. DICKSON What are you talking about?

Dickson looks in the direction in which  Sampson points. CUT TO: 164. INT. LOBBY OF BANK - LONG SHOT From Dickson's angle. This shot takes in the length of the  bank. Clerks, bookkeepers, stenographers  in the f.g., the lobby in the b.g. It  seems a little more crowded than in  previous shot. CUT BACK TO: 164. OUTER OFFICES OF BANK - MED. CLOSE  SHOT Sampson and Dickson. Dickson's face  clouds. SAMPSON They've been coming in steady all morning.  I have called for some extra police. DICKSON (his eyes glued on the crowd) All right. Send down to the vaults and  have our reserve cash sent up here right  away. SAMPSON We haven't much on hand, you know. If  it gets any worse, I hope we don't have  to close the doors. 165. CLOSE SHOT Favoring Dickson. He turns to Sampson. DICKSON (flaring up) The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth  a nickel after that. This is just a  flurry, that's all. They've heard about  the robbery and got panic-stricken.  Listen, get ahold of our available securities  and have them turned into cash. Wait  a minute. Get my personal stuff and  have that turned into cash too. Tell  the boys anyone caught arguing with  a depositor will be fired on the spot. SAMPSON Yes, sir. ? 165 ? 166. MEDIUM SHOT As Sampson leaves. Dickson starts out  in the direction of Sampson's office.  He is stopped by his name being called: CLARK Mr. Dickson! Dickson turns. Clark and several directors  appear. CLARK (grimly) We want to talk to you. DICKSON What about? CLARK We'll discuss that in the board room. He turns to follow, then is stopped  by another voice. DETECTIVE Oh, Mr. Dickson! We got a check on Brown's  alibi. Do you want to hear it? DICKSON (only a slight hesitation) All right. (to Clark) I'll be with you in a minute, Clark. CUT TO: 167. INT. SAMPSON'S OFFICE - MED. CLOSE  SHOT Dickson is by Matt's side. The Inspector  is also in scene. Dickson puts a hand  on Matt's shoulder. DICKSON Now don't worry, son. All you got to  do is answer the questions they ask  you, that's all. CAMERA PANS TO THE DOOR as it opens  and a detective enters, beckons to the  Inspector off scene. 168. MEDIUM SHOT As the Inspector crosses to the new  arrival, who whispers something in his  ear. The others in the room watch them,  interested. The Inspector whispers instructions  to the detective, who leaves. The Inspector  then crosses slowly to Matt. 169. MED. CLOSE SHOT As the Inspector comes up to the group  around Matt. INSPECTOR (carelessly) So you were home last night? MATT (averting his gaze) Yes. INSPECTOR What time did you get in? ? 166 ? MATT (haltingly) Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock. INSPECTOR Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it  was that? MATT Yes. The Inspector turns away and CAMERA  PANS WITH the Inspector as he crosses  quickly to the door and beckons to the  detective outside. INSPECTOR All right, Kelley. Kelley returns to the room accompanied  by a little old Irish woman. She looks  around the room nervously. Inspector  leads her toward Matt. 170. MED. SHOT OF GROUP As everyone stares at her curiously. INSPECTOR (indicating Matt) Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan? MRS. HALLIGAN Sure I do. He has the best room in me  house. The one with the fancy wallpaper. 171. CLOSEUP - MATT He feels himself cornered. The Inspector's  voice comes over the shot. INSPECTOR'S VOICE Did you happen to be awake when he came  in last night? MRS. HALLIGAN Yes, sir. I was having me hot mustard  bath. INSPECTOR What time was it? 172. MED. CLOSEUP - GROUP As Mrs. Halligan continues. MRS. HALLIGAN for the rheumatism, you know. INSPECTOR What time was it, Mrs. Halligan? MRS. HALLIGAN It was late, I know. The Dooley sisters  was already in. They work at a show,  you know. The Inspector is getting impatient. INSPECTOR What time was it? ? 167 ? MRS. HALLIGAN Huh? INSPECTOR What time did Matt Brown get in? MRS. HALLIGAN Now, let me see - a half hour after  the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley  sisters never get home until after INSPECTOR (snappily) I don't care about the Dooley sisters  - what time did he get in? MRS. HALLIGAN That's just what I'm trying to tell  you, sir. It was a half hour after the  Dooley sisters . . . INSPECTOR Was it twelve o'clock? 173. MED. CLOSE SHOT Dickson, Matt, and the rest of the group.  Some show their amusement. Dickson and  Matt, however, are serious. Mrs. Halligan's  voice comes into scene. MRS. HALLIGAN No, it wasn't twelve - 'cause the Dooley  sisters . . . INSPECTOR'S VOICE (interrupting her quickly) Was it one o'clock? 174. CLOSE SHOT Inspector and Mrs. Halligan. MRS. HALLIGAN Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause . .  . INSPECTOR (jumping her) It couldn't have been earlier? MRS. HALLIGAN No. It wasn't earlier because . . . INSPECTOR Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters  weren't in yet. MRS. HALLIGAN (firmly) No - because me clock struck four, and  when it strikes four, it's one. INSPECTOR (exasperated) There you are! 175. MEDIUM SHOT Matt speaks: ? 168 ? MATT Aw, she doesn't know what she's talking  about. Mrs. Halligan looks at him, offended. MRS. HALLIGAN Who don't know? She comes toward him threateningly. MRS. HALLIGAN Listen here, young man - nobody ever  called me a liar yet and got away with  it INSPECTOR (coming after her, takes her arm) That's all, Mrs. Halligan. Thanks. Inspector leads her to the door. On  the way Mrs. Halligan continues to mumble  her protest against Matt's insult. MRS. HALLIGAN For two nickels I'd knock his block  off. I never told a lie in me life. She exits out of room. 176. MED. CLOSE SHOT As Dickson steps closer to Matt. DICKSON (heartsick) Is that true, Matt? Inspector comes up to them now. INSPECTOR Of course it's true - and he knows it. DICKSON (tenderly) Listen, Matt. If you don't tell the  truth, I can't help you. Where were  you last night? MATT (after a pause) Aw, she was right. I didn't get in till  after one o'clock. Dickson is deeply disappointed. MATT (quickly - appealingly) But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest  I wasn't . . . The Inspector barks at Matt: INSPECTOR Then where were you? 177. CLOSE SHOT Favoring Dickson as he leans closer  to Matt. ? 169 ? DICKSON (to Inspector) Wait a minute. Wait a minute. (to Matt) Matt, do you realize you're up against  something? You're being charged with  murder. It's serious, son. Now come  on, I know you didn't do it. (gestures toward Inspector) But we've got to make them believe it.  Come on, tell the truth, where were  you last night? MATT (doggedly) I can't tell you. Matt maintains a determined silence. DICKSON (getting an idea) Listen, if I get them out of the room,  will you tell me ? Matt looks at him. Dickson is the only  person he cannot tell his secret to. MATT No. I won't. DICKSON You're protecting somebody. MATT No, I'm not Mr. Dickson! DICKSON Yes, you are. You're protecting somebody.  Now listen, it doesn't make any difference  who it is. It can't be as important  as this. Now come on, tell me. Where  were you last night? (a note of desperation) Come on, don't be a fool. Matt, you  trust me, don't you? No reply from Matt. Dickson is heartsick.  He turns, helplessly, away from Matt  and walks out of Sampson's office. CUT TO: 178. INT. THE LOBBY OF THE BANK - CLOSE  SHOT Of Gert, the telephone operator. GERT (all excited - into phone) What a day, Mame! Everybody's coming  in and drawing their money out. (innocently) Gee, Mame - I wonder what started it. 179. THE LOBBY OF THE BANK - LONG SHOT Shouting from the offices. The lobby  is now packed to the doors with frantic  depositors. The low grumbling of before  is now replaced by ? 170 ? vociferous condemnation of the bank  and Dickson. Individual protestations  are heard above the din of the crowd. Dickson enters scene, and CAMERA TRUCKS  AHEAD OF HIM as he quickly passes several  tellers, giving them instructions to  pay the depositors without delay. Sampson  catches up with him. SAMPSON Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going  crazy. DICKSON Did you get the case for the securities? SAMPSON Yes, sir. DICKSON Mine too? SAMPSON Yes, sir. But soon as our money runs  out, they'll mob the place. Dickson looks off toward the crowd. DICKSON The fools! If they only knew it, they're  making things worse for themselves.  Somebody starts a silly rumor, and they  lose their heads. SAMPSON What'll we do? DICKSON I'll talk to them. Listen, go back and  tell the boys to stall as much as possible.  Tell 'em not to pay any attention to  what I said. Tell 'em to verify every  signature. He leaves the scene as we CUT TO: 180. LOBBY OF THE BANK - LONG SHOT Taking in a greater portion of the lobby.  Dickson comes into the scene in the  b.g. and stands on the stairs, looking  down at the crowd. He suddenly holds  up his hand and shouts: DICKSON Take your time, folks. Don't get excited.  Everybody stay in line. You'll all be  taken care of. Don't worry about anything.  Plenty of time for everything. He has to raise his voice even louder. DICKSON Now listen, everybody! Listen to me! Gradually their attention is attracted  to him. All eyes are turned in his direction. 181. MED. CLOSE SHOT Shooting toward Dickson, past the crowd. ? 171 ? Dickson standing on the stairs. The  people looking up at him. DICKSON I want you to know that your money is  safe. This bank is in excellent condition.  If you've heard any reports to the contrary,  it's based on malicious rumors. AD-LIB FROM CROWD Yeah? Maybe . . . MAN It's a lotta hooey! We want our money! DICKSON All right. You'll get your money - every  penny! AD-LIB FROM CROWD We want it now! We don't want no speeches! 182. CLOSE SHOT - DICKSON As he addresses the crowd: DICKSON Listen to me now. It takes time. I've  got seven paying tellers working just  as fast as they can. If you'll all calm  down, I'm making arrangements to keep  the doors open until four o'clock this  afternoon and you can be paid today. 183. MEDIUM SHOT OF THE CROWD As they cheer their approval and return  to their buddies. 184. MED. CLOSE SHOT As Dickson starts back toward the offices,  Sampson comes to meet him. SAMPSON We can't keep open till four o'clock.  We haven't cash enough to last an hour. DICKSON Don't you think I know it? They both start walking toward Dickson's  office - CAMERA TRUCKING WITH THEM.  As they pass the conference room, Schultz  comes out and stops Dickson. SCHULTZ We're still waiting for you, Dickson. Dickson looks up, studies Schultz a  moment, as if trying to make up his  mind whether to consult the Board of  Directors or not. CUT TO: 185. INT. DIRECTORS' ROOM - MED. SHOT The door opens and Dickson enters, followed  by Schultz. They all look up. Dickson  goes up to them. DICKSON Well, gentlemen, we've got about one  more hour to go. You know what that  means? ? 172 ? 186. MED. CLOSE SHOT Dickson and the Directors. DICKSON (continuing) We'll be forced to shut the doors. I've  worked twenty-five years night and day  to keep this bank alive. You've all  made money out of it. Are you willing  to help? CLARK (defiantly) What do you mean, help? DICKSON I know that among you, you have at least  a million dollars in various banks throughout  the city. Get that money over here and  I'll stop this run within five minutes. CLARK That sounds very simple, Dickson, but  why should we jeopardize our personal  fortunes? DICKSON I have everything I own in it. It's  your bank as well as mine, isn't it? 187. CLOSE SHOT Clark and Schultz. CLARK (this is just what he's been waiting  for) Oh, is it? Since when? Judging from  the way you've ignored us, you wouldn't  think so. SCHULTZ We tried to reason with you, but you  wouldn't listen to us. 188. MED. CLOSE SHOT Shooting toward Dickson. CLARK The depositors you were protecting were  the first ones to pounce on you. You  thought they were your friends. Why  don't you go out there now and try and  get some help from them? DICKSON Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason  with a mob. 189. CLOSEUP - CLARK CLARK No. You can't reason with anyone else  when you're in a jam. We pleaded with  you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't  listen to us. You preached to us about  faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now  you want our help. You want us to throw  a lot of cash into a bank that you've ? 173 ? wrecked. All right. There's one way  you can get it. Give us an option on  your stock and resign as president. 190. CLOSEUP - DICKSON DICKSON (quietly - tense) So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long  time for this chance, haven't you? (his voice rising) Well, I'm not going to resign now -  or ever. 191. WIDER ANGLE Taking in the others at the table. SCHULTZ You have no choice. DICKSON I haven't? I'll shut the bank first. CLARK (terrified) Say, you can't do that DICKSON I can't? You just wait and see. If that  run doesn't stop within the next hour,  I'll shut the doors. You know what that  means? The bank examiner will step in  tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate.  I'll insist upon it. The depositors  will be paid one hundred cents on the  dollar. What's left you gentlemen can  have. But I'll guarantee there won't  be enough to pay your next month's garage  bill. With which ultimatum, he crosses to  the door and exits, CAMERA PANNING WITH  HIM. CUT TO: 192. INT. OUTSIDE CONFERENCE ROOM -  MED. CLOSE SHOT As Dickson barges out. He stops in front  of the door, and looks off toward lobby. 193. INT. LOBBY OF BANK - FULL SHOT Pandemonium has broken loose. Men and  women are hysterical. The police battle  with recalcitrant depositors in a desperate  effort to maintain order. Strong men  push weak ones out of the lines. Wild-eyed  women jostle and scramble to get near  the paying tellers. Sex and priority  rights are totally disregarded. Above  it all the din is deafening. Men and  women are clamoring for their life's  savings, ready to commit murder to retrieve  their little stakes. CUT TO: 194. OUTSIDE CONFERENCE ROOM - CLOSEUP  - DICKSON His face clouds. As he stands there  watching the chaos, slowly the deep  concern vanishes from his face and his  jaw sets in grim determination. He starts  toward the stairs. ? 174 ? CUT TO: 195.

DICKSON I hate to do this, but I've got to have  time to dig up some help. I think I  know where I can get some real cash.  Snap into it, Sampson. We will lick  this thing yet. He starts out of scene towards his office.  CAMERA TRUCKS AFTER HIM, as he crosses  past Helen, talking without breaking  stride. DICKSON Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book.  I want some numbers to try to get some  action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds  - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old  man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap  into it, Helen. Just as quick as you  can.

IVES My dear friends ? 175 ? SCHULTZ (interrupting) How much longer is Dickson going to  hold out? O'BRIEN You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll  shut the doors before he gives up control. CLARK All right, let him! I'm sick and tired  of hearing about him. If he wants to  run the bank, let him do it. I don't  want any part of it. IVES My dear friends CLARK Oh, shut up! CUT TO: 199. SOMEWHERE BACK OF TELLERS' CAGES  - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT Sampson frantically advising tellers. SAMPSON Stall! Stall! One teller faces an angry depositor. TELLER Er, is this your signature?

INSPECTOR You'd better tell Mr. Dickson we're  taking Matt Brown downtown. DETECTIVE (to 2nd Detective) Is the chief's car outside? 2ND DETECTIVE Yes, sir. INSPECTOR Okay. Come on son. Let's go. The detective takes Matt's arm and makes  him get up from the chair. Helen rushes into the room and into  Matt's arms. 202. CLOSER SHOT Helen clings to Matt. HELEN (sobbing) Oh, Matt . . .

MIKE He left here about an hour ago and went  down to Dude Finlay's joint. INSPECTOR Dude Finlay? MIKE Yes, sir. ? 177 ? 204.

CLUETT If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather  not say - that is, unless it becomes  absolutely essential. You see, she's  married. INSPECTOR (a big understanding grimace) Oh! CLUETT (smiling) You understand? INSPECTOR (assuringly) Why, of course. The telephone rings at this point. Cluett  turns to answer it. ? 180 ? CLUETT Pardon me. He picks up the receiver. The Inspector  watches him closely. 214. WIDER ANGLE As Cluett answers the phone. CLUETT Hello . . . who? Yes, he's here. (to Inspector) It's for you, Inspector. Cluett gets up out of his chair to permit  Inspector to get to the phone. INSPECTOR Thanks. CLUETT (trying to be light) Somebody must be in good humor. He was  humming \"Mother Machree.\" INSPECTOR (laughing) It's one of the boys from headquarters.  He always sings \"Mother Machree\" whenever  he's got good news. Looks like this  case'll be settled in no time. 215. CLOSEUP - CLUETT His face clouds at this. He listens  while Inspector's voice comes over scene: INSPECTOR'S VOICE Yeah, Kelly? Huh? Dude Finlay! Where  do you got him? Inspector pauses, waiting for a reply. CUT TO: 216. INT. SAMPSON'S OFFICE - CLOSEUP  DETECTIVE Detective Kelly, speaking on the phone: KELLY (into phone) I ain't got nobody here. I'm with Brown.  Didn't you tell me to call you up in  five minutes? INSPECTOR'S VOICE Sure. CUT TO: 217. INT. CLUETT'S OFFICE - CLOSEUP  - CLUETT Cluett is terrified. The Inspector's  voice continues: INSPECTOR'S VOICE Take him right down to headquarters. Cluett starts to edge out of scene. ? 181 ? 218. MED. SHOT The Inspector is still holding receiver  to his ear. Cluett has edged close to  the door, his expression one of desperation. The Inspector watches Cluett out of  the corner of his eye as he continues. INSPECTOR (into phone) Yeah. What? . . . You don't mean Cyril  Cluett, the cashier? (long-drawn-out) Yeah-h-h-h-h. (pause) Well! Did Dude Finlay tell you that? CUT TO: 219. INT. SAMPSON'S OFFICE - CLOSEUP  - KELLY KELLY (into phone) What? Dude Finlay? Sure, I got him here!

Okay Kelly, good work. Looks like 221. CLOSE SHOT - CLUETT He feels himself trapped. He glances  around the room quickly to determine  his chances to escape. He keeps edging  closer to the door with his back to  it. His hands sneaks down and grabs  hold of the doorknob. Suddenly, Cluett snaps open the door  and like a flash is out of the room. 222. MED.

DETECTIVE (looking off, and spotting Cluett) There he goes! They rush out of scene, their hands  on their guns, concealed. CUT TO: 226. INT. MEN'S LOCKER ROOM - FULL SHOT Metal lockers line the entire room.  Cluett comes to door on other side of  the room. Just as he gets there, he  hears the detectives entering off scene.  Quickly he changes his mind and springs  into a space between a row of lockers  and the wall, at the same time drawing  his gun. Inspector and detectives enter. The  Inspector and one of the detectives  advance into the room cautiously, holding  their guns in front of them. Kelley,  the other detective, shrewdly separates  from them. DETECTIVE He must be here. There's only one door. INSPECTOR All right. Find him. Cluett slips into a locker and closes  the door behind him. They hear the noise  off scene. INSPECTOR What was that noise? DETECTIVE Sounded like a locker. INSPECTOR A locker, eh? Well, search every one  of them. He must be in one of 'em. They search the lockers one by one,  until the Inspector happens upon the  one with Cluett inside. He leaps out,  gun drawn. 227. CLOSE SHOT - CLUETT From Inspector's angle. CLUETT Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot.  Drop that gun. INSPECTOR (calming tone) All right, Jack, all right. 228. MED. CLOSE SHOT The detective and Inspector.

CLUETT Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of  here, or I'll shoot you! He starts slowly forward. The Inspector ignores the warning. He  takes a few more steps forward. 229. CLOSEUP - CLUETT From Inspector's angle. CLUETT I warn you, Inspector - I'll shoot! He levels his gun. 230. CLOSEUP - KELLEY He lifts his gun and aims for Cluett,  off scene. 231. CLOSEUP - CLUETT He is frightened, but desperate. He  has his finger on the trigger, ready  to fire. CLUETT (nervously) If you take another step, I'll A shot is heard. The gun drops out of  Cluett's hand. His arm goes limp. His  face screws up in pain. INSPECTOR (rushing forward to grab him - to the  detectives) Let me see it! Let me see it! It's only  his finger. Get me a towel. (to Cluett) Now take it easy, buddy. Take it easy.  All we want to do is talk to you. CUT TO: 232. INT. A TELLER'S CAGE MED. - CLOSE  SHOT Shooting over the teller's shoulder. People standing in line, an atmosphere  of pandemonium and hysteria. 233. INT. DICKSON'S PRIVATE OFFICE -  CLOSE SHOT - DICKSON Still at phone. His coat is now off  and flung across the desk. His face  is worn. Perspiration rolls down his  face. His appearance indicates he has  been on the phone a long time. DICKSON (into phone - defeated) You can't do a thing. You're up to your  neck. All right. He listens. He is being turned down.  He hangs up receiver. Over his face  slowly comes a look of deep perturbation.  He refers to a small notebook open on  his desk. His finger runs down the list  of names as he searches for another  prospect. CAMERA PANS ACROSS as Inspector and  other detectives, with Cluett in custody,  enter Dickson's office, all excited. ? 184 ? INSPECTOR You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown didn't  have anything to do with it. Here's  your man. DICKSON Why, you must be crazy. I've known this  man for years. INSPECTOR He's just confessed. He's been mixed  up with the toughest gangsters in town. CAMERA PANS BACK to Dickson, as he stares,  unbelievingly, at the shrunken figure  of Cluett, who is trembling with fear. 234. CLOSER SHOT Favoring Cluett and Dickson. DICKSON Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name,  what got into you? CLUETT (his voice shaking) I don't know. It's all been like a crazy  nightmare, Mr. Dickson. DICKSON What happened? You're not a thief. How'd  you get mixed up with these kind of  people? CLUETT Gambling - I owed them a lot of money.  Last week I lost over fifty thousand  dollars! DICKSON (shocked) Fifty thousand dollars! CLUETT (hysterically) But I didn't kill that man last night.  Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson! 235. CLOSEUP - CLUETT As he continues: CLUETT (dully) Yesterday they came to collect it. I  begged them to wait. I wanted time to  think, but they wouldn't listen to me. (his voice rises) They threatened to kill me if I didn't  pay it! I was desperate! I didn't know  what to do! 236. CLOSEUP - DICKSON As he reacts to Cluett's confession.  Cluett's voice continues over this shot. CLUETT'S VOICE (hoarsely - quickly) Then they suggested that I help them  rob the bank. All I had to do was turn  off the alarm and ? 185 ? fix the time clock. It all sounded so  easy. It seemed like a way out. 237. MED. CLOSE SHOT - GROUP As Cluett continues: CLUETT (wildly) I didn't know anybody was going to be  killed! The Inspector addresses Cluett: INSPECTOR What were you doing at Finlay's this  morning? CLUETT They took my keys yesterday. I went  there to get them back. DICKSON (desperately) If you were in a jam, why didn't you  come to me? I would have helped you  out. You know that. 238. CLOSE SHOT Favoring Cluett. CLUETT I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson.  I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered  around in a daze. All I could think  of was that they were going to kill  me . . . (pleading desperately) You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson?  You won't go back on me now, will you?  I'll die if they send me to prison! INSPECTOR (practical) Don't forget there's a dead watchman  downstairs. CLUETT (wild-eyed) I didn't kill him! I had nothing to  do with that, I tell you! I was home  in my apartment last night - I can prove  it! 239. MED. CLOSE SHOT OF GROUP INSPECTOR (skeptically) Claims he was there with a married woman.  Doesn't want to mention her name. CLUETT (desperately - to Dickson) He won't believe it, Mr. Dickson. But  it's the truth - honest it is. I was  in my apartment last night - ask your  wife - she He stops dead. Suddenly he realizes  what he is saying. 240. CLOSEUP - DICKSON As he reacts electrically to the mention  of his wife. ? 186 ? 241. CLOSE SHOT - CLUETT He slaps a hand over his mouth, as if  to crush out anything further he might  say. He stares wide-eyed and frightened  at Dickson. 242. CLOSE TWO SHOT - DICKSON AND CLUETT Dickson glares at Cluett, penetratingly.  His brain slowly absorbs the revelation  that Phyllis was in Cluett's apartment  the night before. DICKSON (dully) My wife? What's she got to do with you? INSPECTOR (out of the side of his mouth - to a  detective standing next to him) No wonder he didn't want to mention  her name. Dickson comes over to Cluett, grabs  him by the arm. DICKSON What was my wife doing in your apartment  last night? CLUETT (hysterically) Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't  pay any attention to me. I don't know  what I'm saying. DICKSON You just mentioned her name. What was  she doing there? What was she doing  in your apartment? CLUETT She just came up for a drink. Just for  a few minutes. Dickson grabs Cluett and shakes him. DICKSON (a shriek) You're lying! 243. MED. CLOSE SHOT INSPECTOR Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find  out whether he's telling the truth.  I'll have a man from headquarters check  up on it right away. DICKSON (hard) You don't want to check up on anybody.  I'll do all the checking up. Wait a  minute. CAMERA PANS WITH HIM as he crosses to  his desk, and calls Helen on the intercom. DICKSON Helen! HELEN'S VOICE Yes? ? 187 ? DICKSON Get Mrs. Dickson on the phone. There is an awkward pause while Dickson  waits. He is obviously agitated. Then  the phone rings. DICKSON (answering it) Listen, dear. I want to ask you something.  I know it's a silly thing for me to  ask you, but . . . I want you to tell  me the truth. Where were you last night? CUT TO: 244. INT. DICKSON HOME - CLOSEUP - MRS.  DICKSON MRS. DICKSON (into phone - disconcerted) Last night? Er - why - uh, last night  . . . CUT TO: 245. INT. DICKSON'S OFFICE - CLOSEUP  - DICKSON DICKSON (very sombre) Listen, dear.

Well dear, you  see, I . . . I . . . CUT TO: 247. INT. DICKSON'S OFFICE - MED. CLOSE  SHOT Favoring Dickson, but showing Cluett  and the others. Dickson slowly puts the phone receiver  down. His face is ashen. He is shaken  to the core. CLUETT (miserably) She wasn't to blame, Mr. Dickson. It  wasn't her fault. Honest, it wasn't.  I begged her to come up. She didn't DICKSON (an explosion) Get out, get out! INSPECTOR All right. Let's go. The detectives get on either side of  Cluett and silently they march him out  of the room. Inspector and others follow,  leaving Dickson alone. When they have  gone out: ? 188 ? 248. CLOSE SHOT - DICKSON Left alone, he is a tragic figure. An  incessant parade of disturbing thoughts  tumble over each other in a hectic march  across his chaotic mind. He grips his  throbbing temples in an effort to crush  out the torturous thought that Phyllis  was involved in an intrigue with Cyril  Cluett. CUT TO: 249. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MED. SHOT Most of the directors seem to be weakening.  O'Brien is remaining staunch to Dickson.  Clark alone, holds out. O'BRIEN Clark, you're insane to hold out any  longer. Now let's get some money over  here and stop this run. AMES If we close our doors, our stock won't  be worth a nickel. Meek little Ives once more tries to  speak: IVES My dear friends, I O'BRIEN (interrupting) I'll lay you ten to one, Dickson won't  give in. 250. CLOSER SHOT Featuring Schultz and Clark, standing  together. SCHULTZ Maybe they're right, Clark. CLARK (weakening) All right, I'll go and have a talk with  him. As he starts to walk toward the door: CUT TO: 251. INT. DICKSON'S PRIVATE OFFICE -  FULL SHOT Dickson sits at his desk, his head cupped  in his hands. Clark enters thru door  of outer office, quietly. He looks at  Dickson a moment, then crosses to the  desk. CLARK Oh, Dickson . . . 252. CLOSE SHOT OF THE TWO Shooting toward Dickson. Dickson slowly looks up at Clark. CLARK (softly) Dickson, I'd like to talk to you about  the bank. ? 189 ? DICKSON (heartsick) The bank. All right. Do anything you  want with it. 253. CLOSE SHOT - CLARK His face lights up. This is a turn he  never expected. He really came in to  capitulate. CLARK (smoothly) Now you're talking sense. (alert) We'll draw up the option on your stock  - say, eighty dollars a share. How's  that? 254. CLOSE SHOT - DICKSON He is not even interested, speaks vaguely: DICKSON Eighty dollars? That's fine - anything  you say. He waves Clark away. CLARK Good, good. I'll draw it up at once. 255. MED. SHOT As Clark starts out of Dickson's office,  elated, Helen comes in. HELEN You want the rest of those numbers,  Mr. Dickson? DICKSON (toneless) Numbers? No, never mind. She stares at him, surprised, backs  out of the room. CUT TO: 256. INT. OUTER ROOM OF DICKSON'S OFFICE  - HELEN AND MATT Immediately following: MATT What's he doing, honey? Is he getting  any help? HELEN Something's happened. He isn't trying  anymore. MATT They must have turned him down. HELEN Yes. He called some of the biggest people  in town. MATT Sure, they'd turn him down. He ought  to know that. I'm going in there and  talk to him. As he enters Dickson's office: CUT TO: ? 190 ? 257. INT. DICKSON'S OFFICE CAMERA PANS ACROSS as Matt enters: MATT We haven't got much time left, Mr. Dickson.  We've got to do something quick or it'll  be too late. DICKSON (softly) Why wouldn't you tell me where you were  last night? MATT (ignoring the question) You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson? DICKSON Were you in Cluett's apartment? MATT (dismissively) Oh, I can explain about that later.  You're losing your bank - don't you  realize what that means? DICKSON (gravely) Was Mrs. Dickson there? MATT Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them  lick you just because a couple of big  shots turned you down. You've got more  friends than anybody in this town. Little  guys - guys who wouldn't be in business  if it weren't for you. All you've got  to do is DICKSON (undeterred) Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was  Mrs. Dickson there? MATT (fumbling for words) Well . . . uh . . . I . . . Dickson She was, wasn't she? How long has this  been going on? Do you know? MATT Aw, I don't know what you're talking  about. All I know is that you're losing  your bank and DICKSON (firmly) All right. That's all. (poignantly) Please, Matt. Head bowed, Matt exits scene. ? 191 ? CUT TO: 258. INT. DICKSON'S OUTER OFFICE - MATT  AND HELEN Immediately following: HELEN Did you talk to him? MATT (downcast) Yeah. (he has a sudden inspiration) I got an idea. Come on, let's get to  a telephone. They exit scene hurriedly. CUT TO: 259. INT. DICKSON'S PRIVATE OFFICE -  MED. CLOSEUP All of his beliefs are shaken by this  seeming betrayal. Dickson takes a framed  photograph of Phyllis from his desk,  gingerly sets it face down in the center  drawer of his desk. Also in the desk drawer is - he cannot  help but notice - a gun. CUT TO: 260. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CLOSE SHOT  - CLARK As he dictates to someone off screen: CLARK a thirty-day option on ten thousand  shares of stock of this company, now  registered in the name of Thomas A.

SOMEWHERE IN THE BANK - CLOSE  SHOT AT PAYROLL WINDOW Shooting past cashier in f.g. towards  line of laborers waiting to be paid. Cashier stands in front of a tall counter  upon which is a small metal box filled  with currency. He is speaking into the  phone by his side as scene opens. He hangs up receiver and turns to the  men on the other side of the window. CASHIER (speaking thru small window) Sorry ladies and gentlemen, there's  no more money. You'll have to go on  to the next window. He snaps the window shut, slams down  cover of little metal box. Angry ad-lib from line of laborers waiting  to be paid. CUSTOMER AD-LIBS What do you mean there's no more money?  etc. ? 192 ? Panicked shouting and pushing. In the  center of the crowd, a woman faints.

DICKSON (to bank guard) Are you sure he's in there? GUARD Yes, ma'am. He must be in there. He  hasn't come out. She pounds on the door again. MRS. DICKSON (shouting) Tom! Tom! Tom!

Dickson remains silent. Mrs. Dickson  continues: ? 193 ? MRS. DICKSON Cyril Cluett doesn't mean anything to  me, Tom. I went out with him last night  simply because . . . well, I had begun  to feel that I didn't have any part  in your life. That I was an outsider.  Tom, all we did was to go to the theatre,  and then we went back to his apartment  afterward for a drink. That's all it  was. I didn't do anything wrong, Tom.  I couldn't do anything wrong. I love  you too much. You know that. 265. CLOSEUP - DICKSON As he stares dully out the window. Mrs. Dickson's voice coming over shot: MRS. DICKSON (breaking down - sobbing) Oh, Tom! Tom! CUT TO: 266.

Although Matt has focus in the scene,  Helen's voice is always in b.g., as  she handles calls, making the same pitch. MATT (into phone - rat-a-tat) Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's  getting worse. HELEN (simultaneously) Mr. Williams . . . MATT (continuing) The big guys have got the screws on  him. You've got to come through for  him, Mr. Conway.

They are perceptibly impressed. 277. MED. CLOSE SHOT - CLARK He has remained unmoved, staring at  Dickson, as if trying to determine what  kind of ruse is this. DICKSON'S VOICE Come on boys!

CHARLIE Ten to one he'll have a crack about  the run yesterday. TELLER It's a cinch bet. I wouldn't take it. 2ND TELLER If he pulls a gag about the run, we'll  murder the guy. Murder him! They hear Matt approaching, and gesture  silence. Matt strides purposefully in.  He works the mechanism on the vault.  There is a long silence, during which  nobody says anything, most surprisingly  of all, not even Matt. Finally: MATT (after having opened the lock - turning  to the group of expectant tellers) Well, I suppose you guys had a good  run for your money yesterday! They tackle him to the ground. CUT TO: 287. INT. BANK ENTRANCE MED. - CLOSE  SHOT As Dickson enters, and playfully pushes  the hat down over Gardiner, the old  bank guard's face. The bank guard adjusts  his hat, annoyed, then sees it is the  president of the bank. GARDINER (merrily) Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is  much better this morning. DICKSON Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right  too. Guard puzzles over his non-sequitur  for a moment, then smiles. CAMERA TRUCKS AHEAD OF DICKSON, as he  strides through the lobby, passing various  individuals from opening scenes. He spots the teller with a habit of  smoking on the job. DICKSON Carter! The teller, from Dickson's angle, holds  up his empty hands. No cigarettes. Then,  he opens his mouth and chews elaborately,  showing that he has switched to gum. Hellos and Good Mornings greet Dickson  as he continues on his way. He passes  the janitor in a new uniform, and stops  him. DICKSON Well, well, well - got your uniform,  eh? JANITOR Yes, sir. ? 200 ? DICKSON Looks good. How much did it cost? JANITOR (proudly) I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it  for me. Dickson opens his jacket, affects an  unenthusiastic perusal of his own well-worn  suit of clothing. DICKSON (cheerfully) Oh-oh. I guess I'll have to see Sampson  myself. CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM as he approaches  Helen's desk outside his own private  office. Helen looks up. DICKSON Good morning, Helen. HELEN Good morning. DICKSON Say, I know what's the matter with you.  Matt! Matt, hearing his name, dashes up to  stand next to Dickson. 288. MED. CLOSE SHOT DICKSON I want you both to take the day off.  Go downtown and get a license and get  married right away! MATT (weakly) But I haven't . . . DICKSON I don't want to hear any more about  it. If you don't get married, I'll fire  both of you. By now they are beaming. Dickson starts  off, then has a second thought. DICKSON Helen, while you're downtown, you might  stop in and make reservations for the  bridal suite on the Berengaria[9] sailing  next week. MATT Gee, thanks, Mr. Dickson HELEN Oh! DICKSON (cutting him off) Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only  going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and  I are going to go on the honeymoon. With just the barest suggestion of a  wink, he exits. ? 201 ? Matt looks at Helen: MATT Come, on slave. They exit arm in arm. FADE OUT. END",
