Kennedy is seeking  change on all fronts.  Bitter battles  are fought with Southern  segregationists to get James Meredith  into the University of Mississippi.   Three months after Kennedy submits a  sweeping civil rights bill to  Congress, Martin Luther King leads  250,000 in a march on Washington.   Robert Kennedy, as Attorney General,  for the first time ever vigorously  prosecutes the Mafia in American  life, bringing and winning a record  number of cases - 288 convictions of  organized crime figures including 13  grand juries against Jimmy Hoffa and  his Teamsters Union.  The President  also takes on Big Business, forcing  back steel prices, winning 45 of 46  antitrust cases during 1963 and he  wants to help everyday taxpayers by  ending age- old business privileges  like the oil depletion allowance and  the fees paid to the Federal Reserve  Bank for printing America's currency. Revolutionary changes are foreseen  after J.F.K.'s assumed re-election  in 1964.  Foremost in the political  consciousness of the country is the  possibility of a Kennedy dynasty.   Robert Kennedy in '68, Teddy Kennedy  in '76.  In November, 1963 John  Kennedy travels to Texas, his  popularity sagging to 59% largely  due to his civil rights stand for  which he is particularly hated in  the South.  Texas is a crucial state for him to carry in '64.  With him  is Vice-President, Lyndon Johnson  and Texas Governor John Connally.   On November 21, they visit Houston  and San Antonio.  On the morning of  November 22, he speaks in Fort Worth,  then flies 15 minutes to Love Field  in Dallas, where he takes a motorcade  through downtown Dallas on his way  to speak at 12:30 at the International  Trade Mart.  Later, the motorcade  takes him through Dealey Plaza at  12:30...",

The  camera moves to framed photos of Jim as a young, Lincolne lawyer... we hear sounds of political rallies, cheering.. shot of Jim's grandfather shaking hands with President Wi Taft.  The sound of bulldozers carries us to a shot of Ji staring at piles of decaying corpses at Dachau... a photo Clarence Darrow... a law degree and an appointment as Dis Attorney of the New Orleans Parish... Mother Garrison wit young Jim on the desk... another family - his own.  We lo across the thick desk with the chess set, A Complete Works of William Shakespeare and a Nazi helmet with a bul hole in it... to Jim himself writing - pen to paper.  We  sense the quiet intellect of the 43 year old man.  The cl ticks in the awful suspended silence. It's as if the air itself has been sucked from the silent room.  This is the last moment of peace before the World  will rush through the door in all its sound and fury - to change his life forever.  The camera haywires into a clos up of Jim as he looks up... and knows. Lou Ivon, Jim's chief investigator, is already standing t in the room.  He is burly, in his 30s - his expression  universal for that day.",

Set up all the bases for the invasion  supposed to take place in October  '62.  Khrushchev sent the missiles  to resist the invasion, Kennedy  refused to invade and we were standing  out there with our dicks in the wind.   Lot of pissed-off people, Mr.   Garrison, you understand?  I'll come  to that later... I spent much of  September '63 working on the Kennedy  plan for getting all U.S.  personnel  out of Vietnam by the end of '65.   This plan was one of the strongest  and most important papers issued  from the Kennedy White House.  Our  first 1,000 troops were ordered home  for Christmas.  Tensions were high.

There'd already  been several attempts on de Gaulle's  life in France.  Only a month before  in Dallas UN Ambassador Adlai  Stevenson had been spit on and hit.   We'd have arrived days ahead of time,  studied the route, checked all the  buildings... We never would've allowed all those  wide-open empty windows overlooking  Dealey... never...  We would have  had our own snipers covering the  area.  The moment a window went up  they'd have been on the radio.  We  would've been watching the crowds -  packages, rolled up newspapers, a  coat over an arm, never would have  let a man open an umbrella along the  way - Never would've allowed that  limousine to slow down to 10 miles  per hour, much less take that unusual  curve at Houston and Elm.  You would  have felt an Army presence in the  streets that day, but none of this  happened.  It was a violation of the  most basic protection codes we have.   And it is the best indication of a  massive plot in Dallas.  Who could  have best done that?  People in my  business, Mr. Garrison.  People like  my superior officer could've told  Col. Reich, \"Look - we have another  unit coming from so and so providing  security.  You'll stand down.\"  That  day, in fact, there were some  individual Army Intelligence people  in Dallas and I'm still trying to  figure out who and why.  But they  weren't protecting the client.

We had a  third of a combat division returning  from Germany in the air above the  United States at the time of the  shooting, and at 12:34 P.M., the  entire telephone system went dead in  Washington for a solid hour, and on  the plane back to Washington, word  was radioed from the White House  Situation Room to Lyndon Johnson  that one individual performed the  assassination.  Does that sound like  a bunch of coincidences to you, Mr.  Garrison?  Not for one moment.  The  cabinet was out of the country to  get their perception out of the way.   The troops were in the air for  possible riot control.  The phones  didn't work to keep the wrong stories  from spreading if anything went wrong  with the plan.  Nothing was left to  chance.

You know how many helicopters  have been lost in Vietnam?  About  three thousand so far.  Who makes  them?  Bell Helicopter.  Who owns  Bell?  Bell was near bankruptcy when  the First National Bank of Boston  approached the CIA about developing  the helicopter for Indochina usage.   How 'bout the f-111 fighters?  General  Dynamics in Fort Worth.  Who owns  that?  Find out the defense budget  since the war began.  $75 going on a  hundred billion ... $200 billion'll  be spent before it ends.  In 1950 it  was $13 billion.  No war, no money.   Sometimes I think the organizing  principle of any society is for war.   The authority of the state over it's  people resides in it's war powers.   Even Eisenhower - military hero of  WWII - warned us about it: \"beware  the military - industrial complex\",  he said.  Kennedy wanted to end the  Cold War in his second term.  He  wanted to call of the moon race in  favor of cooperation with the Soviets.   He signed a treaty with the Soviets  to ban nuclear testing, he refused  to invade Cuba in '62, and he set  out to withdraw from Vietnam.  But  that all ended on November 22, 1963.",

Young law student have come to watch.  The crowd is noisy the point of unruliness.  Suddenly there's a hush as ever cranes their necks to see Clay Shaw and his attorneys, Ir Dymond and two others, enter the court.  Shaw, impeccably dressed, his high handsome cheekbones sucking on an ever- present cigarette in a porcelain filter (smoking in court was allowed then), smiles to those who greet him as if th were not really there and limps past Jim with a stony  indifference. The clerk starts pounding the gavel to call the court to  order as Judge Edward Aloysius Haggerty sweeps in and tak the bench.  He's a stocky little Jimmy Cagney look alike  with fierce blue eyes under bushy brows.  The jurors - ni white men and three black men - all dressed in suits and  ties, look on. CUT TO Willie O'Keefe pointing out Clay Shaw.",

The Warren Commission  thought they had an open and shut  case: three bullets, one assassin -  but two things happened that made it  virtually impossible: 1)the Zapruder  film which you just saw, and 2)the  third wounded man, Jim Tague, who  was nicked by a fragment down by the  Triple Underpass.  The time frame of  5.6 seconds established by the  Zapruder film left no possibility of  a fourth shot from Oswald's rifle,  but the shot or fragment that left a  superficial wound on Tague's cheek  had to come from a bullet that missed  the car entirely.  Now they had two  bullets that hit, and we know one of  them was the fatal head shot.  So a  single bullet remained to account  for all seven wounds in Kennedy and  Connally.  But rather than admit to  a conspiracy or investigate further,  the Commission chose to endorse the  theory put forth by an ambitious  junior counsellor, Arlen Specter.   One of the grossest lies ever forced  on the American people, we've come  to know it as the \"magic bullet\"  theory.",

It then  moves upward in order to leave  Kennedy's body from the front of his  neck - his neck wound number two -  where it waits 1.6 seconds, turns  right and continues into Connally's  body at the rear of his right armpit -  wound number three.  Then, the bullet  heads downward at an angle of 27  degrees, shattering Connally's fifth  rib and leaving from the right side  of his chest - wounds four and five.   The bullet continues downward and  then enters Connally's right wrist -  wound number six - shattering the  radius bone.  It then enters his  left thigh - wound number seven -  from which it later falls out and is  found in almost \"pristine\" condition  on a stretcher in a corridor of  Parkland Hospital. (he shows a mock-up  of the \"pristine\"  bullet) That's some bullet.  Anyone who's  been in combat can tell you never in  the history of gunfire has there  been a bullet like this. (the court laughs) The Army Wound Ballistics experts at  Edgewood Arsenal fired some comparison  bullets and not one of them looked  anything like this one. (he shows mock-ups of  comparison bullets) Take a look at CE 856, an identical  bullet fired through the wrist of a  human cadaver - just one of the bones  smashed by the magic bullet.  Yet  the government says it can prove  this with some fancy physics in a  nuclear laboratory.  Of course they  can.  Theoretical physics can prove  an elephant can hang from a cliff  with it's tail tied to a daisy, but  use your eyes - your common sense - (he holds the bullet) Seven wounds, skin, bone.  This single  bullet explanation is the foundation  of the Warren Commission's claim of  a lone assassin.  And once you  conclude the magic bullet could not  create all seven of those wounds,  you have to conclude there was a  fourth shot and a second rifleman.   And if there was a second rifleman,  there had to be a conspiracy, which  we believe involved the accused Clay  Shaw.  Fifty-one witnesses, gentlemen  of the jury, thought they heard shots  coming from the Grassy Knoll, which  is to the right and front of the  President.",

Officer Tippit is  shot between 1:10 and 1:15 about a  mile away.  Though no one actually  saw him walking or jogging, the  Government says Oswald covered that  distance.  Incidentally, that walk,  if he did it, is in a straight line  toward Jack Ruby's house.  Giving  the government the benefit of the  doubt, Oswald would have had to jog  a mile in six to eleven minutes and  commit the murder, then reverse  direction and walk 3/5 of a mile to  the Texas Theatre and arrive sometime  before 1:30.

The  glitter of official lies and the  epic splendor of the thought-numbing  funeral of J.F.K. confuse the eye  and confound the understanding.   Hitler always said \"the bigger the  lie, the more people will believe  it.\"  Lee Oswald - a crazed, lonely  man who wanted attention and got it  by killing a President, was only the  first in a long line of patsies.  In  later years Bobby Kennedy and Martin  Luther King, men whose commitment to  change and to peace would make them  dangerous to men who are committed  to war, would follow, also killed by  such \"lonely, crazed men,\" who remove  our guilt by making murder a  meaningless act of a loner.  We have  all become Hamlets in our country -  children of a slain father - leader  whose killers still possess the  throne.  The ghost of John F. Kennedy  confronts us with the secret murder  at the heart of the American dream.   He forces on us the appalling  questions:  Of what is our  Constitution made?  What is our  citizenship, and more, our lives  worth?  What is the future of a  democracy where a President can be  assassinated under conspicuously  suspicious circumstances while the  machinery of legal action scarcely  trembles?  How many political murders,  disguised as heart attacks, cancer,  suicides, airplane and car crashes,  drug overdoses will occur before  they are exposed for what they are?",

And  the men who killed Kennedy, no doubt,  were honorable men.  I believe we  have reached a time in our country,  similar to what life must've been  like under Hitler in the 30's, except  we don't realize it because Fascism  in our country takes the benign  disguise of liberal democracy.  There  won't be such familiar signs as  swastikas.  We won't build Dachaus  and Auschwitzes.  We're not going to  wake up one morning and suddenly  find ourselves in gray uniforms goose -  stepping off to work ... \"Fascism  will come,\" Huey Long once said. \"in  the name of anti-fascism\" - it will  come in the name of your security -  they call it \"National Security,\" it  will come with the mass media  manipulating a clever concentration  camp of the mind.  The super state  will provide you tranquility above  the truth, the super state will make  you believe you are living in the  best of all possible worlds, and in  order to do so will rewrite history  as it sees fit.

I submit to you that what took place  on November 22, 1963 was a coup  d'etat.  Its most direct and tragic  result was a reversal of President  Kennedy's commitment to withdraw  from Vietnam.  War is the biggest  business in America worth $80 billion  a year.  The President was murdered  by a conspiracy planned in advance  at the highest levels of the United  States government and carried out by  fanatical and disciplined Cold  Warriors in the Pentagon and CIA's  covert operations apparatus - among  them Clay Shaw here before you.  It  was a public execution and it was  covered up by like - minded  individuals in the Dallas Police  Department, the Secret Service, the  FBI, and the White House - all the  way up to and including J.

All these  documents are yours - the people's  property - you pay for it, but because  the government considers you children  who might be too disturbed to face  this reality, because you might lynch  those involved, you cannot see these  documents for another 75 years.  I'm  in my 40's, so I'll have shuffled  off this mortal coil by then, but  I'm already telling my 8 year - old  son to keep himself physically fit  so that one glorious September morning  in 2038 he can walk into the National  Archives and find out what the CIA  and the FBI knew.  They may even  push it back then.  It may become a  generational affair, with questions  passed down from father to son, mother  to daughter, in the manner of the  ancient runic bards.  Someday  somewhere, someone might find out  the damned Truth.

You have a lot to think about.   Going back to when we were children,  I think most of us in this courtroom  thought that justice came into being  automatically, that virtue was its  own reward, that good would triumph  over evil.  But as we get older we  know that this just isn't true.   \"The frontier is where a man faces a  fact.\"  Individual human beings have  to create justice and this is not  easy because truth often presents a  threat to power and we have to fight  power often at great risk to  ourselves.  People like Julia Ann  Mercer, S.M. Holland, Lee Bowers,  Jean Hill, and Willie O'Keefe have  come forward and taken that risk. (he produces a stack  of letters) I have here some $8000 in these  letters sent to my office from all  over the country - quarters, dimes,  dollar bills from housewives,  plumbers, car salesmen, teachers,  invalids ... These are the people  who cannot afford to send money but  do, these are the ones who drive the  cabs, who nurse in the hospitals,  who see their kids go to Vietnam.   Why?  Because they care, because  they want to know the truth - because  they want their country back, because  it belongs to us the people as long  as the people got the guts to fight  for what they believe in!  The truth  is the most important value we have  because if the truth does not endure,  if the Government murders truth, if  you cannot respect the hearts of  these people... (shaking the letters) ...then this is no longer the country  in which we were born in and this is  not the country I want to die in...   And this was never more true than  for John F. Kennedy whose murder was  probably the most terrible moment in  the history of our country.  You the  people, you the jury system, in  sitting in judgement on Clay Shaw,  represent the hope of humanity against  Government power.  In discharging  your duty, in bringing the first  conviction in this house of cards  against Clay Shaw, \"Ask not what  your country can do for you, but  what you can do for your country.\"   Do not forget your young President  who forfeited his life.  Show the  world this is still a government of  the people, for the people, and by  the people.  Nothing as long as you  live will ever be more important.
