They thought it would do me good to spend the summer with kids my own age... We were lodged in an old castle in the midst of a magnificent wooded landscape... I think it was in the Auvergne... I don't know... in any case it was the opposite of what I'd expected... We had to get up at 6 and go for a morning swim. Not far from the castle, there was a pond fed by an icy mountain stream. We entered it running, in a double file. You know, I was never very sporty. They had a program to keep us on the go all day, probably to nip any potential pubescent impulses in the bud ... But the worst thing was the food. The third day after our arrival, there was rice pudding for lunch. I hate rice pudding. We sat at long tables in a huge hall. I didn't want to eat the stuff and the housemaster said to me: You won't get up until you've cleared your plate. So after the meal everybody left the room, and I remained seated, in tears.
