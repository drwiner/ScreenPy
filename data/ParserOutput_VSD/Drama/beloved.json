It cost too much! Now sit down and eat with us or leave us be! Sethe's sudden outburst startles Paul. He watches as Seth ushers Denver out to the keeping room off the kitchen to quiet her down. Alone, Paul is disturbed by Sethe's words. He fishes out pouch of tobacco and concentrates on it, searching for smoking papers he knows he doesn't have...waiting for Set to return. When she does, she heads straight for the stove. She spit her finger and touches it to check it's heat. She then be to make bread from flour, soda and salt - keeping her bac Paul throughout - as the scene continues;",

She stops when she sees: A FLATBED gliding down river. She can't make out if they' white people or not, so she hides behind a tree until it passes; Waiting behind the tree, we see that Sethe is sweating a fever. But Denver seems to be doing fine. She sees the flatbed pass her and continues on her way. S sees; THREE COLORED PEOPLE - AN OLDER MAN and two boys - fishin She approaches cautiously. One of the boys is the first to see her. Sethe's bloody a torn clothes and her feverish face make her quite a sight the young boy. He taps the Old Man on the shoulder and motions for him to turn around. The Old Man takes in Sethe and instantly knows where she' been and why she's there.",

Love all your inside parts, love 'em..and the beating heart, love that too. More than eyes or feet. More than lungs that have yet to draw free air, love your heart. For this is the prize. And with her twisted, broken old body BABY SUGGS BEGINS T DANCE AND TWIRL UP ON HER ROCK. And the crowd gives her music, SINGING IN FOUR PART HARMO CAMERA PANS THE CROWD OF BEAUTIFUL FACES singing together Among the crowd, we see FAMILIAR FACES... WE SEE THE WOMEN WHO SANG AT 124... WE STAMP PAID, ELLA, JOHN, and LADY JONES... AND WE SEE SETHE, SURROUNDED BY ALL HER CHILDREN.",
