We hear his movement; short, abrupt shifting, ending almost immediately with th sound of his body banging against wood. He screams, though it's clear from the sound that his mou is covered by something. After attempting to sit up, he immediately bangs his head against something. It's terribly warm and his breaths are labored. He attempts to move to his left and right, only to find t he is confined on those sides, as well. He frantically shifts about, only to discover, by touch, that he is enca in something. Something is very wrong, and he doesn't need to see to kn that. Finally, we see him, lit by the flame of the Zippo he hol in his hands, which are bound together in front of him wi rope. A rolled-up, dirty rag is tied tightly around his head, stretched across his mouth. Dried blood stains his hair and forehead. We see that he is lying in an old fashioned, wooden coffi Nothing more than a few rotted-out planks of wood nailed together. Realizing the same, Paul is struck by an overwhelming, instant panic. With great difficulty, and while still holding the lit Zi Paul removes the muzzle from his mouth.",

Using the strength of his legs, he attempts to lift the t off the coffin with his back. Trickles of sand fall in from the side of the coffin, sprinkling against the wooden base. He fails, only to immediately try again. And again. And again. Exhaustion sets in. Staring ahead, the phone sits in front of him.

Paul then tries to clasp the box with his feet, but after several unsuccessful attempts, he realizes that a new strategy is necessary. 38. He makes efforts to reposition himself in the coffin, so his head and feet will ultimately switch places. He struggles, inch by troubled inch, to make this maneuver. Sweat pours down the side of his face. The extremely tigh quarters of the coffin make the repositioning nearly impossible. After expending a great deal of energy doing so, Paul eventually completes the turn of his body. He examines th small, rusted metal box. On it is a cartoon picture of a small Arab boy and girl playing with a red rubber ball. Skeptical at first, Paul carefully examines the box and shakes it gently. Items are heard rummaging inside. He carefully opens it. A fluorescent green light shines f inside. Paul looks inside and finds a lit, green glow stick, fluorescing brightly and now illuminating much of the cof He closes the lid of the Zippo. Removes the stick. Looking into the small box again, he finds several other items: a small, disused flashlight; a second, unlit glow stick; a jackknife; and lastly, a folded piece of paper. He slowly unfolds the piece of paper. We see that his ran message is written in an unintelligible mix of English an Arabic. Paul shakes his head and lets out a sigh of disgust. He crumbles up the paper into a ball and listlessly drops it his side. He covers his face with his hands, his labored breaths echoing in his palms.

The second glow stick is snapped, illuminating the coffin with a fluorescent green hue. Paul starts to move, but suddenly freezes. His eyes widen His pupils dilate. Something is clearly very wrong, thoug we cannot see what. His eyes slowly shift downward, as if watching something down his body. Beads of sweat form across his brow. His measured breaths are held for as long as they can be. Moving excruciatingly slow, Paul lowers the glow stick to what he is looking at. A shape moves across his stomach, underneath his T-shirt. Paul's eyes are fixed on whatever it may be. He cautiousl slowly, moves the glow stick even closer. The shape disappears just as the light of the glow stick shines on whatever it may be. Still, Paul does not dare m any sudden move. Paul's pant leg moves slightly, starting at the top, slow undulating toward his cuff. Paul leans the glow stick in further. And further. Carefully. Moving a millimeter at a time. He shifts the position of his head slightly, charily, to see next to hi feet. He leans in even closer with the glow stick. But then -- -- his wary movement comes to immediate stop. It's a snake. A two-foot, saw-scaled viper. It has positioned itself in the corner of the coffin, inches fro Paul's feet. 54. His terror evident, Paul very slowly pulls his feet back toward his upper body, away from the snake. The confined space offers little room for safety. The snake turns its muscled neck to face Paul. Their eyes meet for the first time. The snake hisses, poised to stri at any moment. Paul raises his foot. Steels himself. Prepares to preempt the snake with a solid stomp. A more sensible plan soon prevails. After lowering his fo Paul cautiously removes the flask from his pocket. Slowly unscrews the top. Splashes a small amount of alcohol on t floor, close to the snake. The snake recoils slightly, but then menacingly twists it into a new posture, ready to attack. Paul lowers the Zipp to the small puddle of alcohol. After a few sparks -- -- it lights. A flash-fire. The snake flails and hisses wildly at the other side of a small fire wall. The flame soon goes out. Paul moves fast. Throws more alcohol, this time some of it lands on the snake itself. places the already lit Zippo against the puddle of alcoho near the snake. Another flash-fire, this time burning the snake. It hisse loudly. Threateningly. It swings back and forth, challenging the small wall of fire. The fire soon extinguishes. The snake burrows into the ho from where it likely entered the coffin, disappearing int with haste. Paul hurriedly stuffs the hole with his discarded button- shirt. He then pours a small amount of alcohol over the shirt and temporarily puts the flask on the ground, but d not screw the cap on securely. He then wedges the lit Zip between a small space between two wooden planks. With the snake situation handled, Paul finally lets out a sigh of relief. Rubs his eyes. Tries to regain his faculties. Looks over the list of phone numbers written above him. Suddenly, the cell phone vibrates. Paul frenziedly search for it, but he cannot find it. He then notices it has fal into the small hole near his feet, out of his reach. He makes several attempts to grab the phone with his feet but he is unable to do so. It continues to ring. His next efforts involve repositioning himself in the cof so that he completely turns to face the opposite end. 55. Struggling through each move, Paul painstakingly begins t turn himself. While turning, however, he inadvertently ki the Zippo from the side of the coffin -- landing it on th floor, up against the glow stick -- and knocks over the flask. We see that the flame of the Zippo slowly melts the plast glow stick, causing it to dim slightly. Worst still, and completely unbeknownst to Paul, a stream alcohol slowly makes its way from the flask and toward th flame of the lighter, threatening to set the coffin ablaz Inch by inch, the flammable spirit gets closer. Still in the midst of his repositioning, Paul looks back sees the alcohol nearing the flame. In a panic, he attemp to reach and grab the Zippo. But, he finds himself stuck the middle of the coffin. He can't budge either way.",
