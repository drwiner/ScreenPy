The wiping's taking forever, and his shit keeps sticking to his fur. Wait, what happens next? Oh, right-- he asks the rabbit if he ever has trouble wiping. The rabbit says no, shit just slides right off him. So the bear picks the rabbit up and wipes his ass with him. (pause, as if for applause) Well, I never said it was a good joke. And see, that makes it perfect, because it's pretty much the story of my life. We can now see that he's perched on a stool, wearing a RE shirt and old jeans. He gesticulates vaguely as he talks.",

Even if I did spend my childhood hearing my father go on and on about how, like, Nirvana would never mean anything because they're not the Beatles, blah-blah. I don't know, this is all starting to sound a little bit too angsty, you know, and that's about the last thing I'm going for here... Shit, I really got off track there, didn't I?
