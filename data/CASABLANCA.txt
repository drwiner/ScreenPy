     INSERT - A revolving globe. When it stops revolving it turns
     briefly into a contour map of Europe, then into a flat map.

     Superimposed over this map are scenes of refugees fleeing
     from all sections of Europe by foot, wagon, auto, and boat,
     and all converging upon one point on the tip of Africa --
     Casablanca.

     Arrows on the map illustrate the routes taken as the voice of
     a NARRATOR describes the migration.

                          NARRATOR (V.O.)
               With the coming of the Second World
               War, many eyes in imprisoned Europe
               turned hopefully, or desperately,
               toward the freedom of the Americas.
               Lisbon became the great embarkation
               point. But not everybody could get
               to Lisbon directly, and so, a
               tortuous, roundabout refugee trail
               sprang up. Paris to Marseilles,
               across the Mediterranean to Oran,
               then by train, or auto, or foot,
               across the rim of Africa to
               Casablanca in French Morocco. Here,
               the fortunate ones, through money,
               or influence, or luck, might obtain
               exit visas and scurry to Lisbon,
               and from Lisbon to the New World.
               But the others wait in Casablanca -
               - and wait -- and wait -- and wait.

     The narrator's voice fade away...

     EXT. OLD MOORISH SECTION OF THE CITY - DAY

     At first only the turrets and rooftops are visible against a
     torrid sky.

     The facades of the Moorish buildings give way to a narrow,
     twisting street crowded with the polyglot life of a native
     quarter. The intense desert sun holds the scene in a torpid
     tranquility. Activity is unhurried and sounds are muted.

                                                        CUT TO:


     INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

     A POLICE OFFICER takes a piece of paper from the typewriter,
     turns to a microphone, and reads.

                          POLICE OFFICER
               To all officers! Two German
               couriers carrying important
               official documents murdered on
               train from Oran. Murderer and
               possible accomplices headed for
               Casablanca. Round up all suspicious
               characters and search them for
               stolen documents. Important!

                                                        CUT TO:


     EXT. A STREET IN THE OLD MOORISH SECTION - DAY

     An officer BLOWS his whistle several times.

     There is pandemonium as native guards begin to round up
     people.

     A police car, full of officers, with SIREN BLARING, screams
     through the street and stops in the market.

     Some try to escape but are caught by the police and loaded
     into a police wagon.

     At a street corner TWO POLICEMEN stop a white CIVILIAN and
     question him.

                          FIRST POLICEMAN
               May we see your papers?

                          CIVILIAN
                    (nervously)
               I don't think I have them on me.

                          FIRST POLICEMAN
               In that case, we'll have to ask you
               to come along.

     The civilian pats his pockets.

                          CIVILIAN
               Wait. It's just possible that I...
               Yes, here they are.

     He brings out his papers. The second policeman examines them.

                          SECOND POLICEMAN
               These papers expired three weeks
               ago. You'll have to come along.

     Suddenly the civilian breaks away and starts to run wildly

     down the street.

     The policeman SHOUTS "Halt", but the civilian keeps going.

     JAN and ANNINA BRANDEL, a very young and attractive refugee
     couple from Bulgaria, watch as the civilian passes. They've
     been thrust by circumstances from a simple country life into
     an unfamiliar and hectic world.

     A shot RINGS out, and the man falls to the ground. Above him,
     painted on the wall, is a large poster of Marshal Petain,
     which reads: "Je tiens mes promesses, meme celles des
     autres."

     The policeman frantically searches the body, but only finds
     Free French literature.

                                                        CUT TO:


     EXT. PALAIS DE JUSTICE - DAY

     We see an inscription carved in a marble block along the
     roofline of the building: "Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite"

     We see the the facade, French in architecture, then the high-
     vaulted entrance which is inscribed "Palais de Justice".

     At the entrance the arrested suspects are led in by the
     police.

                                                        CUT TO:


     EXT. SIDEWALK CAFE - DAY

     A middle-aged ENGLISH COUPLE sit at a table just off the
     square, and observe the commotion across the way in front of
     the Palais de Justice.

     The police van pulls up. The rear doors are opened and people
     stream out.

     A EUROPEAN man, sitting at a table nearby, watches the
     English couple more closely than the scene on the street.

                          ENGLISHWOMAN
               What on earth's going on there?

                          ENGLISHMAN
               I don't know, my dear.

     The European walks over to the couple.

                          EUROPEAN
               Pardon, pardon, Monsieur, pardon
               Madame, have you not heard?

                          ENGLISHMAN
               We hear very little, and we
               understand even less.

                          EUROPEAN
               Two German couriers were found
               murdered in the desert... the
               unoccupied desert. This is the
               customary roundup of refugees,
               liberals, and uh, of course, a
               beautiful young girl for Monsieur
               Renault, the Prefect of Police.

                                                        CUT TO:


     EXT. PALAIS DE JUSTICE - DAY

     Suspects are herded out of the van, and into the Palais de
     Justice.

                                                        CUT TO:


     EXT. SIDEWALK CAFE - DAY

                          EUROPEAN
               Unfortunately, along with these
               unhappy refugees the scum of Europe
               has gravitated to Casablanca. Some
               of them have been waiting years for
               a visa.

     He puts his left arm compassionately around the Englishman,
     and reaches behind the man with his right hand.

                          EUROPEAN (CONT’D)
               I beg of you, Monsieur, watch
               yourself. Be on guard. This place
               is full of vultures, vultures
               everywhere, everywhere.

     The Englishman seems to be taken aback by this sudden display
     of concern.

                          ENGLISHMAN
               Ha, ha, thank you, thank you very
               much.

                          EUROPEAN
               Not at all. Au revoir, Monsieur. Au
               revoir, Madame.

     He leaves. The Englishman, still a trifle disconcerted by

     the European's action, watches him as he leaves.

                          ENGLISHMAN
               Au revoir. Amusing little fellow.
               Waiter!

     As he pats both his breast and pants pockets he realizes
     there is something missing.

                          ENGLISHMAN (CONT’D)
               Oh. How silly of me.

                          ENGLISHWOMAN
               What, dear?

                          ENGLISHMAN
               I've left my wallet in the hotel.

                          ENGLISHWOMAN
               Oh.

     Suddenly the Englishman looks off in the direction of the
     departed European, the clouds of suspicion gathering.

     Interrupting overhead is the DRONE of a low flying airplane.

     They look up.

                                                        CUT TO:


     EXT. OVERHEAD SHOT - DAY

     An airplane cuts its motor for landing.

     EXT. PALAIS DE JUSTICE - DAY

     Refugees wait in line outside the Palais de Justice. Their
     upturned gaze follows the flight of the plane. In their faces
     is revealed one hope they all have in common, and the plane
     is the symbol of that hope.

     Jan and Annina look up at the plane.

                          ANNINA
                    (wistfully)
               Perhaps tomorrow we'll be on that
               plane.

                                                        CUT TO:


     EXT. OVERHEAD SHOT - DAY

     The plane SWOOPS down past a sign atop a building at the edge
     of the airport.

     The sign reads "Rick's Cafe Americain."

                                                        CUT TO:


     EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY

     As the plane lands a swastika on its tail is clearly visible.
     It taxis to a stop as a group of officers march into
     formation in front of it. Behind them stand a detail of
     native soldiers keeping guard.

     In the group is CAPTAIN LOUIS RENAULT, a French officer
     appointed by Vichy as Prefect of Police in Casablanca. He is
     a handsome, middle-aged Frenchman, debonair and gay, but
     withal a shrewd and alert official.

     With him are HERR HEINZE, the German consul, CAPTAIN TONELLI,
     an Italian officer, and LIEUTENANT CASSELLE, Renault's aide.

     When the plane door opens, the first passenger to step out is
     a tall, middle-aged, pale German with a smile that seems more
     the result of a frozen face muscle than a cheerful
     disposition. On any occasion when MAJOR STRASSER is crossed,
     his expression hardens into iron.

     Herr Heinze steps up to him with upraised arm.

                          HEINZE
               Heil Hitler.

                          STRASSER
               Heil Hitler.

     They shake hands.

                          HEINZE
               It is very good to see you again,
               Major Strasser.

                          STRASSER
               Thank you. Thank you.

     Heinze introduces Strasser to Renault.

                          HEINZE
               May I present Captain Renault,
               Police Prefect of Casablanca. Major
               Strasser.

     Renault salutes.

                          RENAULT
               Unoccupied France welcomes you to
               Casablanca.

                          STRASSER
                    (in perfect English,
                     smiling)
               Thank you, Captain. It's very good
               to be here.

                          RENAULT
               Major Strasser, my aide, Lieutenant
               Casselle.

     As they acknowledge each other, Captain Tonelli barges in
     front of Casselle and salutes Strasser.

                          TONELLI
               Captain Tonelli, the Italian
               service, at your command, Major.

                          STRASSER
               That is kind of you.

     But Tonelli gets no further than that as Strasser turns again
     to Renault. They walk away from the plane, Heinze following,
     with Casselle and Tonelli bringing up the rear, engaged in a
     heated exchange of words.

                          RENAULT
               You may find the climate of
               Casablanca a trifle warm, Major.

                          STRASSER
               Oh, we Germans must get used to all
               climates, from Russia to the
               Sahara. But perhaps you were not
               referring to the weather.

                          RENAULT
                    (sidesteps the implication
                     with a smile)
               What else, my dear Major?

                          STRASSER
                    (casually)
               By the way, the murder of the
               couriers, what has been done?

                          RENAULT
               Realizing the importance of the
               case, my men are rounding up twice
               the usual number of suspects.

                          HEINZE
               We already know who the murderer
               is.

                          STRASSER
               Good. Is he in custody?

                          RENAULT
               Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight
               he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes
               to Rick's.

                          STRASSER
               I have already heard about this
               cafe, and also about Mr. Rick
               himself.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


     EXT. RICK'S CAFE - NIGHT

     The neon sign above the door is brightly lit. Customers
     arrive and go in through the front door. From inside we hear
     sounds of MUSIC and LAUGHTER. The song is "It Had to Be You."

     Again we isolate on the neon sign.

     INSERT SIGN: "Rick's Cafe Americain".

     We follow a group of customers inside.


     INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

     Rick's is an expensive and chic nightclub which definitely
     possesses an air of sophistication and intrigue.

     SAM, a middle-aged Negro, sits on a stool before a small,
     salmon-colored piano on wheels, playing and singing while
     accompanied by a small orchestra.

     All about him there is the HUM of voices, CHATTER and
     LAUGHTER.

     The occupants of the room are varied. There are Europeans in
     their dinner jackets, their women beautifully begowned and
     bejeweled. There are Moroccans in silk robes. Turks wearing
     fezzes. Levantines. Naval officers. Members of the Foreign
     Legion, distinguished by their kepis.

     Two men sit at a table.

                          MAN
               Waiting, waiting, waiting. I'll
               never get out of here. I'll die in
               Casablanca.

     His companion seems uninterested in his dilemma. Sympathy is
     evidently in short supply in Casablanca.

     At another table a very well-dressed WOMAN talks to a MOOR.
     She has a bracelet on her wrist. No other jewelry.

                          WOMAN
               But can't you make it just a little
               more? Please.

                          MOOR
               I'm sorry, Madame, but diamonds are
               a drug on the market. Everybody
               sells diamonds. There are diamonds
               everywhere. Two thousand, four
               hundred.

                          WOMAN
               All right.

     On to another table where two CONSPIRATORS talk.

                          CONSPIRATOR
               The trucks are waiting, the men are
               waiting. Everything is...

     He stops abruptly as two German officers walk by.

     A REFUGEE and another MAN converse at another table.

                          MAN
               It's the fishing smack Santiago. It
               leaves at one tomorrow night, here
               from the end of La Medina. Third
               boat.

                          REFUGEE
               Thank you, oh, thank you.

                          MAN
               And bring fifteen thousand francs
               in cash. Remember, in cash.

     On the way to the bar we pass several tables and hear a Babel
     of foreign tongues. Here and there we catch a scattered
     phrase or sentence in English.

     SACHA, a friendly young Russian bartender, hands a drink to a
     customer with the Russian equivalent of "Bottoms Up." The
     customer answers with "Cheerio."

     CARL, the waiter, is a fat, jovial German refugee with

     spectacles. He walks, tray in hand, to a private door, over
     which ABDUL, a large, burly man, stands guard.

                          CARL
               Open up, Abdul.

                          ABDUL
                    (respectfully)
               Yes, Herr Professor.

     Abdul opens the door and Carl goes into the gambling room.


     INT. RICK'S CAFE - GAMBLING ROOM - NIGHT

     Their is much activity at the various tables. At one table
     TWO WOMEN and a MAN play cards. They glance at another table.

     One of them calls to Carl.

                          FIRST WOMAN
               Uh, waiter.

                          CARL
               Yes, Madame?

                          FIRST WOMAN
               Will you ask Rick if he'll have a
               drink with us?

                          CARL
               Madame, he never drinks with
               customers. Never. I have never seen
               him.

                          SECOND WOMAN
                    (disappointedly)
               What makes saloon-keepers so
               snobbish?

                          MAN
                    (to Carl)
               Perhaps if you told him I ran the
               second largest banking house in
               Amsterdam.

                          CARL
               The second largest? That wouldn't
               impress Rick. The leading banker in
               Amsterdam is now the pastry chef in
               our kitchen.

                          MAN
               We have something to look forward
               to.

                          CARL
               And his father is the bell boy.

     Carl laughs.

     The overseer walks up to a table with a paper in his hand.

     Then we see a drink and a man's hand, but nothing more. The
     overseer places a check on the table. The hand picks up the
     check and writes on it, in pencil, "Okay-Rick."

     The overseer takes the check.

     We now see RICK, sitting at a table alone playing solitary
     chess. Rick is an American of indeterminate age. There is no
     expression on his face -- complete deadpan.

     There is a commotion at the door as people attempt to come
     into the gambling room. He nods approval to Abdul.

     Then a GERMAN appears in the doorway. Abdul looks to Rick who
     glances back toward the open door and nods "no".

     Abdul starts to close the door on the man.

                          ABDUL
               I'm sorry sir, this is a private
               room.

                          GERMAN
               Of all the nerve! Who do you
               think... I know there's gambling in
               there! There's no secret. You dare
               not keep me out of here!

     The man tries to push his way through the door as Rick walks
     up.

                          RICK
                    (coldly)
               Yes? What's the trouble?

                          ABDUL
               This gentleman --

     The German interrupts and waves his card.

                          GERMAN
               I've been in every gambling room
               between Honolulu and Berlin and if
               you think I'm going to be kept out
               of a saloon like this, you're very
               much mistaken.

     At this moment UGARTE, a small, thin man with a nervous air,

     tries to squeeze through the doorway blocked by the German.

     If he were an American, Ugarte would look like a tout.

     He gets through and passes Rick.

                          UGARTE
               Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.

                          RICK
                    (softly)
               Hello Ugarte.

     Rick looks at the German calmly, takes the card out of his
     hand, and tears it up.

                          RICK (CONT’D)
               Your cash is good at the bar.

                          GERMAN
               What! Do you know who I am?

                          RICK
               I do. You're lucky the bar's open
               to you.

                          GERMAN
               This is outrageous. I shall report
               it to the Angriff!

     The German storms off, tossing the pieces of his card into
     the air behind him.

     Rick meets Ugarte on his way back to his table.

                          UGARTE
                    (fawning)
               Huh. You know, Rick, watching you
               just now with the Deutsches Bank,
               one would think you'd been doing
               this all your life.

                          RICK
                    (stiffening)
               Well, what makes you think I
               haven't?

                          UGARTE
                    (vaguely)
               Oh, nothing. But when you first
               came to Casablanca, I thought --

                          RICK
                    (coldly)
               -- You thought what?

     Fearing to offend Rick, Ugarte laughs.

                          UGARTE
               What right do I have to think?

     Ugarte pulls out a chair at Rick's table.

                          UGARTE (CONT’D)
               May I? Too bad about those two
               German couriers, wasn't it?

                          RICK
                    (indifferently)
               They got a lucky break. Yesterday
               they were just two German clerks.
               Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.

                          UGARTE
               You are a very cynical person,
               Rick, if you'll forgive me for
               saying so.

     Ugarte sits down.

                          RICK
                    (shortly)
               I forgive you.

     A waiter comes up to the table with a tray of drinks. He
     places one before Ugarte.

                          UGARTE
               Thank you.
                    (to Rick)
               Will you have a drink with me
               please?

                          RICK
               No.

                          UGARTE
               I forgot. You never drink with...
                    (to waiter)
               I'll have another, please.
                    (to Rick, sadly)
               You despise me, don't you?

                          RICK
                    (indifferently)
               If I gave you any thought, I
               probably would.

                          UGARTE
               But why? Oh, you object to the kind
               of business I do, huh? But think of
               all those poor refugees who must
               rot in this place if I didn't help
               them. That's not so bad. Through
               ways of my own I provide them with
               exit visas.

                          RICK
               For a price, Ugarte, for a price.

                          UGARTE
               But think of all the poor devils
               who cannot meet Renault's price. I
               get it for them for half. Is that
               so parasitic?

                          RICK
               I don't mind a parasite. I object
               to a cut-rate one.

                          UGARTE
               Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be
               through with the whole business,
               and I am leaving finally this
               Casablanca.

                          RICK
               Who did you bribe for your visa?
               Renault or yourself?

                          UGARTE
                    (ironically)
               Myself. I found myself much more
               reasonable.

     He takes an envelope from his pocket and lays it on the
     table.

                          UGARTE (CONT’D)
               Look, Rick, do you know what this
               is? Something that even you have
               never seen. Letters of transit
               signed by General de Gaulle. Cannot
               be rescinded, not even questioned.

     Rick appears ready to take them form Ugarte.

                          UGARTE (CONT’D)
               One moment. Tonight I'll be selling
               those for more money than even I
               have ever dreamed of, and then,
               addio Casablanca! You know, Rick, I
               have many friends in Casablanca,
               but somehow, just because you
               despise me you're the only one I
               trust. Will you keep these for me?
               Please.

                          RICK
               For how long?

                          UGARTE
               Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little
               longer.

                          RICK
               I don't want them here overnight.

                          UGARTE
               Don't be afraid of that. Please
               keep them for me. Thank you. I knew
               I could trust you.

     Rick takes them. Ugarte leaves the table just as the waiter
     comes up.

                          UGARTE (CONT’D)
               Oh, waiter. I'll be expecting some
               people. If anybody asks for me,
               I'll be right here.

                          WAITER
               Yes, Monsieur.

     The waiter leaves. Ugarte turns to Rick.

                          UGARTE
               Rick, I hope you are more impressed
               with me now, huh? If you'll forgive
               me, I'll share my good luck with
               your roulette wheel.

     He starts across the floor.

                          RICK
               Just a moment.

     Ugarte stops as Rick comes up to him.

                          RICK (CONT’D)
               Yeah, I heard a rumor that those
               German couriers were carrying
               letters of transit.

     Ugarte hesitates for a moment.

                          UGARTE
               Huh? I heard that rumor, too. Poor
               devils.

     Rick looks at Ugarte steadily.

                          RICK
                    (slowly)
               Yes, you're right, Ugarte. I am a
               little more impressed with you.

     Rick leaves the gambling room and goes into the main room.

                                                        CUT TO:


     INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

     Rick makes his way over to Sam, who plays and sings the
     "Knock Wood" number, accompanied by the orchestra. The cafe
     is in semi-darkness. The spotlight is on Sam, and every time
     the orchestra comes in on the "Knock Wood" business, the
     spotlight swings over to the orchestra.

     During one of the periods when the spotlight is on the
     orchestra, Rick slips the letters of transit into the piano.

     FERRARI, owner of the Blue Parrot, a competing night spot,
     comes into the cafe, sits down, and watches Sam.

     Then he sees Rick and they smile at each other. At the end of
     the number Ferrari goes to the bar to speak to Rick.

                          FERRARI
               Hello, Rick.

                          RICK
               Hello, Ferrari. How's business at
               the Blue Parrot?

                          FERRARI
               Fine, but I would like to buy your
               cafe.

                          RICK
               It's not for sale.

                          FERRARI
               You haven't heard my offer.

                          RICK
               It's not for sale at any price.

                          FERRARI
               What do you want for Sam?

                          RICK
               I don't buy or sell human beings.

                          FERRARI
               That's too bad. That's Casablanca's
               leading commodity. In refugees
               alone we could make a fortune if
               you would work with me through the
               black market.

                          RICK
               Suppose you run your business and
               let me run mine.

                          FERRARI
               Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like
               to make a change.

                          RICK
               Suppose we do.

                          FERRARI
               My dear Rick, when will you realize
               that in this world today
               isolationism is no longer a
               practical policy?

     Rick and Ferrari walk over to the piano.

                          RICK
               Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for
               him at the Blue Parrot.

                          SAM
               I like it fine here.

                          RICK
               He'll double what I pay you.

                          SAM
               Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend
               the money I make here.

                          RICK
               Sorry.

     Apparently satisfied, Ferrari walks away.

     Back at the bar, YVONNE, an attractive young French woman,
     sits on a stool drinking brandy.

     Sacha, who looks at her with lovesick eyes, fills her
     tumbler.

                          SACHA
               The boss's private stock. Because,
               Yvonne, I loff you.

                          YVONNE
                    (morosely)
               Oh, shut up.

                          SACHA
                    (fondly)
               All right, all right. For you,
               Yvonne, I shot opp, because,
               Yvonne, I loff you. Uh oh.

     Rick saunters over and leans on the bar, next to Yvonne.

     He pays no attention to her. She looks at him bitterly,
     without saying a word.

                          SACHA (CONT’D)
               Oh, Monsieur Rick, Monsieur Rick.
               Some Germans, boom, boom, boom,
               boom, gave this check. Is it all
               right?

     Rick looks the check over and tears it up. Yvonne has never
     taken her eyes off Rick.

                          YVONNE
               Where were you last night?

                          RICK
               That's so long ago, I don't
               remember.

                          YVONNE
               Will I see you tonight?

                          RICK
                    (matter-of-factly)
               I never make plans that far ahead.

     Yvonne turns, looks at Sacha, and extends her glass to him.

                          YVONNE
               Give me another.

                          RICK
               Sacha, she's had enough.

                          YVONNE
               Don't listen to him, Sacha. Fill it
               up.

                          SACHA
               Yvonne, I loff you, but he pays me.

     Yvonne wheels on Rick with drunken fury.

                          YVONNE
               Rick, I'm sick and tired of having
               you --

                          RICK
               -- Sacha, call a cab.

                          SACHA
               Yes, boss.

     Rick takes Yvonne by the arm.

                          RICK
               Come on, we're going to get your
               coat.

                          YVONNE
               Take your hands off me!

     He pulls her along toward the door.

                          RICK
               No. You're going home. You've had a
               little too much to drink.

                                                        CUT TO:


     EXT. RICK'S CAFE - NIGHT

     Sacha stands at the curb on the street in front of Rick's and
     signals for a cab.

                          SACHA
               Taxi!

     Soon one pulls up.

     Rick and Yvonne come out of the cafe. He puts a coat over her
     shoulders and she objects violently.

                          YVONNE
               Who do you think you are, pushing
               me around? What a fool I was to
               fall for a man like you.

     Rick and Yvonne approach the waiting cab.

                          RICK
                    (to Sacha)
               You'd better go with her, Sacha, to
               be sure she gets home.

                          SACHA
               Yes, boss.

                          RICK
               And come right back.

                          SACHA
                    (his face falling)
               Yes, boss.

     Rick stands and looks up at the revolving beacon light from
     the airport. It intermittently sheds its light on Rick's
     face.

     Renault sits at a table on the cafe terrace, watching this
     evening's performance.

                          RENAULT
               Hello, Rick.

     Rick walks over to him.

                          RICK
               Hello, Louis.

                          RENAULT
               How extravagant you are, throwing
               away women like that. Someday they
               may be scarce.

     Rick sits down at the table.

                          RENAULT (CONT’D)
                    (amused)
               You know, I think now I shall pay a
               call on Yvonne, maybe get her on
               the rebound, eh?

                          RICK
               When it comes to women, you're a
               true democrat.

     As they talk, Captain Tonelli and Lieutenant Casselle walk by
     toward the entrance of the cafe. Casselle talks non-stop and
     Tonelli tries. They both stop, salute Renault, and walk into
     the cafe.

                          RENAULT
               If he gets a word in it'll be a
               major Italian victory.

     Rick laughs.

     Rick and Renault look up when they hear the BUZZ of a plane
     taking off from the adjacent airfield. The plane flies
     directly over their heads.

                          RENAULT (CONT’D)
               The plane to Lisbon.
                    (pause)
               You would like to be on it?

                          RICK
                    (curtly)
               Why? What's in Lisbon?

                          RENAULT
               The clipper to America.

     Rick doesn't answer. His look isn't a happy one.

                          RENAULT (CONT’D)
               I have often speculated on why you
               don't return to America. Did you
               abscond with the church funds? Did
               you run off with a senator's wife?
               I like to think you killed a man.
               It's the romantic in me.

     Rick still looks in the direction of the airport.

                          RICK
               It was a combination of all three.

                          RENAULT
               And what in heaven's name brought
               you to Casablanca?

                          RICK
               My health. I came to Casablanca for
               the waters.

                          RENAULT
               Waters? What waters? We're in the
               desert.

                          RICK
               I was misinformed.

                          RENAULT
               Huh!

     EMIL, the croupier, comes out of the cafe and walks over to
     Rick.

                          EMIL
               Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a
               gentleman inside has won twenty
               thousand francs. The cashier would
               like some money.

                          RICK
               Well, I'll get it from the safe.

                          EMIL
               I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You
               know I can't understand --

                          RICK
               -- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like
               that happen all the time.

                          EMIL
               I'm awfully sorry.

     The three men enter the cafe.

                                                        CUT TO:


     INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

     They pass Sam at the piano. He's playing "Baby Face". Rick
     pats Sam on the shoulder.

                          RENAULT
               Rick, there's going to be some
               excitement here tonight. We are
               going to make an arrest in your
               cafe.

                          RICK
                    (somewhat annoyed)
               What, again?

                          RENAULT
               This is no ordinary arrest. A
               murderer, no less.

     Rick's eyes react. Involuntarily, they glance toward the
     gambling room.

     Renault catches the look.

                          RENAULT (CONT’D)
               If you are thinking of warning him,
               don't put yourself out. He cannot
               possibly escape.

                          RICK
               I stick my neck out for nobody.

                          RENAULT
               A wise foreign policy.

     They start upstairs to Rick's office, passing Casselle who is
     still haranguing Tonelli.

                          RENAULT (CONT’D)
               You know, Rick, we could have made
               this arrest earlier in the evening
               at the Blue Parrot, but out of my
               high regard for you we are staging
               it here. It will amuse your
               customers.

                          RICK
               Our entertainment is enough.

     They go inside the office.


     INT. RICK'S CAFE - OFFICE - NIGHT

     Rick opens up the safe in a small, dark room just off the
     office. Only Rick's shadow can be seen getting the money out.

                          RENAULT
               Rick, we are to have an important
               guest tonight, Major Strasser of
               the Third Reich, no less. We want
               him to be here when we make the
               arrest. A little demonstration of
               the efficiency of my
               administration.

     Rick moves out of the shadows and into view.

                          RICK
               I see. And what's Strasser doing
               here? He certainly didn't come all
               the way to Casablanca to witness a
               demonstration of your efficiency.

                          RENAULT
               Perhaps not.

     He gives the money to Emil.

                          RICK
               Here you are.

                          EMIL
               It shall not happen again,
               Monsieur.

                          RICK
               That's all right.

     Emil departs.

                          RICK (CONT’D)
               Louis, you've got something on your
               mind. Why don't you spill it?

     Rick closes the door to the office, then goes over to close
     the safe.

                          RENAULT
               How observant you are. As a matter
               of fact, I wanted to give you a
               word of advice.

                          RICK
               Yeah? Have a brandy?

                          RENAULT
               Thank you. Rick, there are many
               exit visas sold in this cafe, but
               we know that you have never sold
               one. That is the reason we permit
               you to remain open.

                          RICK
               I thought it was because we let you
               win at roulette.

                          RENAULT
               That is another reason. There is a
               man who's arrived in Casablanca on
               his way to America. He will offer a
               fortune to anyone who will furnish
               him with an exit visa.

                          RICK
               Yeah? What's his name?

                          RENAULT
               Victor Laszlo.

                          RICK
               Victor Laszlo?

     Renault watches Rick's reaction.

                          RENAULT
               Rick, that is the first time I have
               ever seen you so impressed.

                          RICK
               Well, he's succeeded in impressing
               half the world.

                          RENAULT
               It is my duty to see that he
               doesn't impress the other half.
               Rick, Laszlo must never reach
               America. He stays in Casablanca.

                          RICK
               It'll be interesting to see how he
               manages.

                          RENAULT
               Manages what?

                          RICK
               His escape.

                          RENAULT
               Oh, but I just told you. --

                          RICK
               -- Stop it. He escaped from a
               concentration camp and the Nazis
               have been chasing him all over
               Europe.

                          RENAULT
               This is the end of the chase.

                          RICK
               Twenty thousand francs says it
               isn't.

     They sit down to discuss the matter in earnest.

                          RENAULT
               Is that a serious offer?

                          RICK
               I just paid out twenty. I'd like to
               get it back.

                          RENAULT
               Make it ten. I am only a poor
               corrupt official.

                          RICK
               Okay.

                          RENAULT
               Done. No matter how clever he is,
               he still needs an exit visa, or I
               should say, two.

                          RICK
               Why two?

                          RENAULT
               He is traveling with a lady.

                          RICK
               He'll take one.

                          RENAULT
               I think not. I have seen the lady.
               And if he did not leave her in
               Marseilles, or in Oran, he
               certainly won't leave her in
               Casablanca.

                          RICK
               Maybe he's not quite as romantic as
               you are.

                          RENAULT
               It doesn't matter. There is no exit
               visa for him.

                          RICK
               Louis, whatever gave you the
               impression that I might be
               interested in helping Laszlo
               escape?

                          RENAULT
               Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect
               that under that cynical shell
               you're at heart a sentimentalist.

     Rick makes a face.

                          RENAULT (CONT’D)
               Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen
               to be familiar with your record.
               Let me point out just two items. In
               1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In
               1936, you fought in Spain on the
               Loyalist side.

                          RICK
               And got well paid for it on both
               occasions.

                          RENAULT
               The winning side would have paid
               you much better.

                          RICK
               Maybe. Well, it seems you are
               determined to keep Laszlo here.

                          RENAULT
               I have my orders.

                          RICK
               Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.

     Renault stands up.

                          RENAULT
               My dear Ricky, you overestimate the
               influence of the Gestapo. I don't
               interfere with them and they don't
               interfere with me. In Casablanca I
               am master of my fate. I am captain
               of my --

     He stops short as his AIDE enters.

                          AIDE
               -- Major Strasser is here, sir.

     Renault starts to leave.

                          RICK
               Yeah, you were saying?

                          RENAULT
                    (hurriedly)
               Excuse me.

     He hurries away. Rick smiles cynically.

                                                        CUT TO:


     INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

     Renault walks up to Carl.

                          RENAULT
               Carl, see that Major Strasser gets
               a good table, one close to the
               ladies.

                          CARL
               I have already given him the best,
               knowing he is German and would take
               it anyway.

     Renault walks over to one of his officers.

                          RENAULT
               Take him quietly. Two guards at
               every door.

                          OFFICER
               Yes, sir. Everything is ready, sir.

     The officer salutes and goes off to speak to the guards.

     Renault walks over to Strasser's table as Rick comes down the
     stairs.

                          RENAULT
               Good evening, gentlemen.

                          STRASSER
               Good evening, Captain.

                          HEINZE
               Won't you join us?

     Renault sits down.

                          RENAULT
               Thank you. It is a pleasure to have
               you here, Major.

                          STRASSER
                    (to the waiter)
               Champagne and a tin of caviar.

                          RENAULT
               May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26,
               a good French wine.

                          STRASSER
               Thank you.

                          WAITER
               Very well, sir.

                          STRASSER
               A very interesting club.

                          RENAULT
               Especially so tonight, Major. In a
               few minutes you will see the arrest
               of the man who murdered your
               couriers.

                          STRASSER
               I expected no less, Captain.

                                                        CUT TO:


     INT. RICK'S CAFE - GAMBLING ROOM - NIGHT

     Ugarte stands at the roulette table. Two gendarmes approach
     him from behind.

                          GENDARME
               Monsieur Ugarte?

     Ugarte looks around.

                          UGARTE
               Oh. Yes?

                          GENDARME
               Will you please come with us.

                          UGARTE
               Certainly. May I first please cash
               my chips?

     The officer nods. They follow Ugarte to the cashier's window.
     Ugarte puts his chips through the window to the CASHIER.

                          UGARTE (CONT’D)
               Pretty lucky, huh? Two thousand,
               please.

     Two more guards station themselves at the door in case there
     is trouble.

                          CASHIER
               Two thousand.

                          UGARTE
               Thank you.

     Ugarte starts to walk out, followed by the gendarmes. When he
     reaches the doorway he suddenly rushes through and slams the
     door behind himself.


     INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

     By the time the gendarmes manage to get the door open again,
     Ugarte has pulled a gun.

     He FIRES at the doorway. The SHOTS bring on pandemonium in
     the cafe.

     As Ugarte runs through the hallway he sees Rick, appearing
     from the opposite direction, and grabs him.

                          UGARTE
               Rick! Rick, help me!

                          RICK
               Don't be a fool. You can't get
               away.

                          UGARTE
               Rick, hide me. Do something! You
               must help me, Rick. Do something!

     Guards and gendarmes rush in and grab Ugarte. Rick stands
     impassively as they drag Ugarte off.

                          UGARTE (CONT’D)
               Rick! Rick!

     We move to Strasser's table, who has witnessed the event.

                          STRASSER
               Excellent, Captain.

     Back to Rick, still standing where he was, as a CUSTOMER
     walks by.

                          CUSTOMER
               When they come to get me, Rick, I
               hope you'll be more of a help.

                          RICK
               I stick my neck out for nobody.

     Rick comes out to the middle of the floor. An air of tense
     expectancy pervades the room. A few customers are on the
     point of leaving. Rick speaks in a very calm voice.

                          RICK (CONT’D)
               I'm sorry there was a disturbance,
               folks, but it's all over now.
               Everything's all right. Just sit
               down and have a good time. Enjoy
               yourself.

     Rick glances toward Sam.

                          RICK (CONT’D)
               All right, Sam.

     Sam nods and begins to play.

     Renault, Strasser, and Heinze sit calmly at their table after
     witnessing the arrest.

     Rick walks by.

                          RENAULT
                    (calling to Rick)
               Oh, Rick?

     Rick stops and comes over to their table.

                          RENAULT (CONT’D)
               Rick, this is Major Heinrich
               Strasser of the Third Reich.

                          STRASSER
               How do you do, Mr. Rick?

                          RICK
               Oh, how do you do?

                          RENAULT
               And you already know Herr Heinze of
               the Third Reich.

     Rick nods to Strasser and Heinze.

                          STRASSER
               Please join us, Mr. Rick.

     Rick sits down with them.

                          RENAULT
               We are very honored tonight, Rick.
               Major Strasser is one of the
               reasons the Third Reich enjoys the
               reputation it has today.

                          STRASSER
               You repeat "Third Reich" as though
               you expected there to be others.

                          RENAULT
               Well, personally, Major, I will
               take what comes.

                          STRASSER
                    (to Rick)
               Do you mind if I ask you a few
               questions? Unofficially, of course.

                          RICK
               Make it official, if you like.

                          STRASSER
               What is your nationality?

                          RICK
                    (pokerfaced)
               I'm a drunkard.

                          RENAULT
               That makes Rick a citizen of the
               world.

                          RICK
               I was born in New York City if
               that'll help you any.

                          STRASSER
               I understand you came here from
               Paris at the time of the
               occupation.

                          RICK
               There seems to be no secret about
               that.

                          STRASSER
               Are you one of those people who
               cannot imagine the Germans in their
               beloved Paris?

                          RICK
               It's not particularly my beloved
               Paris.

                          HEINZE
               Can you imagine us in London?

                          RICK
               When you get there, ask me.

                          RENAULT
               Ho, diplomatist!

                          STRASSER
               How about New York?

                          RICK
               Well, there are certain sections of
               New York, Major, that I wouldn't
               advise you to try to invade.

                          STRASSER
               Aha. Who do you think will win the
               war?

                          RICK
               I haven't the slightest idea.

                          RENAULT
               Rick is completely neutral about
               everything. And that takes in the
               field of women, too.

                          STRASSER
               You weren't always so carefully
               neutral. We have a complete dossier
               on you.

     Strasser takes a little black book from his pocket and turns
     to a certain page.

                          STRASSER (CONT’D)
               "Richard Blaine, American. Age,
               thirty-seven. Cannot return to his
               country."

     Strasser looks up from the book

                          STRASSER (CONT’D)
               The reason is a little vague. We
               also know what you did in Paris,
               Mr. Blaine, and also we know why
               you left Paris.

     Rick reaches over and takes the book from Strasser's hand.

                          STRASSER (CONT’D)
               Don't worry. We are not going to
               broadcast it.

     Rick looks up from the book.

                          RICK
               Are my eyes really brown?

                          STRASSER
               You will forgive my curiosity, Mr.
               Blaine. The point is, an enemy of
               the Reich has come to Casablanca
               and we are checking up on anybody
               who can be of any help to us.

                          RICK
                    (glances toward Renault)
               My interest in whether Victor
               Laszlo stays or goes is purely a
               sporting one.

                          STRASSER
               In this case, you have no sympathy
               for the fox, huh?

                          RICK
               Not particularly. I understand the
               point of view of the hound, too.

                          STRASSER
               Victor Laszlo published the foulest
               lies in the Prague newspapers until
               the very day we marched in, and
               even after that he continued to
               print scandal sheets in a cellar.

                          RENAULT
               Of course, one must admit he has
               great courage.

                          STRASSER
               I admit he is very clever. Three
               times he slipped through our
               fingers. In Paris he continued his
               activities. We intend not to let it
               happen again.

     Rick gets up.

                          RICK
               You'll excuse me, gentlemen. Your
               business is politics. Mine is
               running a saloon.

                          STRASSER
               Good evening, Mr. Blaine.

     Rick walks away toward the gambling room.

                          RENAULT
               You see, Major, you have nothing to
               worry about Rick.

                          STRASSER
               Perhaps.

     A couple comes in the front door. They are VICTOR LASZLO, the
     Czech resistance leader, and a very pretty young woman
     wearing a simple white gown, MISS ILSA LUND. She is so
     beautiful, in fact, that people turn to stare.

     The HEADWAITER comes up to them.

                          HEADWAITER
               Yes, Monsieur?

                          LASZLO
               I reserved a table. Victor Laszlo.

                          HEADWAITER
               Yes, Monsieur Laszlo. Right this
               way.

     As the headwaiter takes them to a table they pass by the
     piano, and the woman looks at Sam.

     Sam, with a conscious effort, keeps his eyes on the keyboard
     as they go past. He appears to know this woman. After she has
     gone by Sam steals a look in her direction.

     BERGER, a slight, middle-aged man, observes the couple from a
     distance.

     The headwaiter seats Ilsa. Laszlo takes the chair opposite
     and surveys the room.

     Strasser and Renault look up at them from their table.

                          LASZLO
               Two cointreaux, please.

                          WAITER
               Yes, Monsieur.

                          LASZLO
                    (to Ilsa)
               I saw no one of Ugarte's
               description.

                          ILSA
               Victor, I, I feel somehow we
               shouldn't stay here.

                          LASZLO
               If we would walk out so soon, it
               would only call attention to us.
               Perhaps Ugarte's in some other part
               of the cafe.

     Berger walks up to their table.

                          BERGER
               Excuse me, but you look like a
               couple who are on their way to
               America.

                          LASZLO
               Well?

     Berger takes a ring from his finger.

                          BERGER
               You will find a market there for
               this ring. I am forced to sell it
               at a great sacrifice.

                          LASZLO
               Thank you, but I hardly think --

                          BERGER
               -- Then perhaps for the lady. The
               ring is quite unique.

     He holds it down for their view. Carefully lifting up the
     stone, he reveals...

     INSERT - a gold plate in the setting underneath, an
     impression of the Lorraine Cross of General de Gaulle.

                          LASZLO
               Oh, yes, I'm very interested.

     Berger sits down with them.

                          BERGER
               Good.

                          LASZLO
                    (lower voice)
               What is your name?

                          BERGER
               Berger, Norwegian, and at your
               service, sir.

     Renault approaches the table from behind Laszlo. Ilsa tries
     to warn him.

                          ILSA
               Victor...

     Laszlo understands.

                          LASZLO
                    (in a low voice)
               I'll meet you in a few minutes at
               the bar.
                    (in a louder voice)
               I do not think we want to buy the
               ring. But thank you for showing it
               to us.

     Berger, taking the cue, sighs and puts the ring away.

                          BERGER
               Such a bargain. But that is your
               decision?

                          LASZLO
               I'm sorry. It is.

     Berger gets up and leaves as Renault moves to the table.

                          RENAULT
               Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?

                          LASZLO
               Yes.

                          RENAULT
               I am Captain Renault, Prefect of
               Police.

                          LASZLO
               Yes. What is it you want?

                          RENAULT
                    (amiably)
               Merely to welcome you to Casablanca
               and wish you a pleasant stay. It is
               not often we have so distinguished
               a visitor.

                          LASZLO
               Thank you. I hope you'll forgive
               me, Captain, but the present French
               administration has not always been
               so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa
               Lund?

                          RENAULT
               I was informed you were the most
               beautiful woman ever to visit
               Casablanca. That was a gross
               understatement.

     Ilsa's manner is friendly and reserved, her voice low and
     soft.

                          ILSA
               You are very kind.

                          LASZLO
               Won't you join us?

     He sits down.

                          RENAULT
               If you will permit me.
                    (calls to the waiter)
               Oh, Emil. Please, a bottle of your
               best champagne, and put it on my
               bill.

                          EMIL
               Very well, sir.

                          LASZLO
               No, Captain, please.

                          RENAULT
               No. Please, Monsieur, it is a
               little game we play. They put it on
               the bill, I tear the bill up. It is
               very convenient.

     Ilsa glances off in Sam's direction.

                          ILSA
               Captain, the boy who is playing the
               piano, somewhere I have seen him.

                          RENAULT
               Sam?

                          ILSA
               Yes.

                          RENAULT
               He came from Paris with Rick.

                          ILSA
               Rick? Who's he?

                          RENAULT
                    (smiling)
               Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and
               Rick is --

                          ILSA
               -- Is what?

                          RENAULT
               Well, Mademoiselle, he's the kind
               of a man that, well, if I were a
               woman and I...
                    (taps his chest)
               were not around, I should be in
               love with Rick. But what a fool I
               am talking to a beautiful woman
               about another man.

     Renault jumps to his feet as Strasser enters.

                          RENAULT (CONT’D)
               Excuse me. Ah, Major. Mademoiselle
               Lund, Monsieur Laszlo, may I
               present Major Heinrich Strasser.

     Strasser bows and smiles pleasantly.

                          STRASSER
               How do you do. This is a pleasure I
               have long looked forward to.

     There is not the slightest recognition from either Ilsa or
     Laszlo.

     Strasser waits to be asked to seat himself.

                          LASZLO
               I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am
               not gracious, but you see, Major
               Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.

                          STRASSER
               You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you
               are a subject of the German Reich!

     Laszlo stands.

                          LASZLO
               I've never accepted that privilege,
               and I'm now on French soil.

                          STRASSER
               I should like to discuss some
               matters arising from your presence
               on French soil.

                          LASZLO
               This is hardly the time or the
               place.

                          STRASSER
                    (hardening)
               Then we shall state another time
               and another place. Tomorrow at ten
               in the Prefect's office, with
               Mademoiselle.

                          LASZLO
               Captain Renault, I am under your
               authority. Is it your order that we
               come to your office?

                          RENAULT
                    (amiably)
               Let us say that it is my request.
               That is a much more pleasant word.

                          LASZLO
               Very well.

     Renault and Strasser bow shortly.

                          RENAULT
               Mademoiselle.

                          STRASSER
               Mademoiselle.

     Renault and Strasser walk away.

                          RENAULT
               A very clever tactical retreat,
               Major.

     Strasser looks at Renault sharply, but sees only a
     noncommittal smile on Renault's face.

     Laszlo remains standing at the table as Strasser and Renault
     leave.

                          LASZLO
               This time they really mean to stop
               me.

                          ILSA
               Victor, I'm afraid for you.

                          LASZLO
               We have been in difficult places
               before, haven't we?

     Ilsa smiles back at him, but her eyes are still troubled.

     On the floor, CORINA strums a guitar and begins her number.

     Meanwhile, Laszlo looks about with apparent casualness. He
     sees Strasser and Renault whispering together, then notices
     Berger at the bar.

                          LASZLO (CONT’D)
               I must find out what Berger knows.

                          ILSA
               Be careful.

                          LASZLO
               I will, don't worry.

     He rises and goes off.

     We see Ilsa's troubled profile.

     While Corina sings, Sam gives a worried glance in Ilsa's
     direction. Ilsa watches him.

     At the bar, Berger sips a drink. Laszlo walks up and casually
     takes a place at the bar next to Berger.

                          LASZLO (CONT’D)
               Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see
               it again?

                          BERGER
               Yes, Monsieur.

                          LASZLO
                    (to Sacha)
               A champagne cocktail, please.

     Laszlo takes the ring and looks at it.

                          BERGER
                    (in a low voice)
               I recognize you from the news
               photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.

                          LASZLO
               In a concentration camp, one is apt
               to lose a little weight.

                          BERGER
               We read five times that you were
               killed in five different places.

                          LASZLO
                    (smiles wryly)
               As you see, it was true every
               single time. Thank heaven I found
               you, Berger. I am looking for a man
               by the name of Ugarte. He is
               supposed to help me.

     Berger shakes his head.

                          BERGER
               Ugarte cannot even help himself,
               Monsieur. He is under arrest for
               murder. He was arrested here
               tonight.

     Laszlo absorbs the shock quietly.

                          LASZLO
               I see.

                          BERGER
                    (with intense devotion)
               But we who are still free will do
               all we can. We are organized,
               Monsieur, underground like
               everywhere else. Tomorrow night
               there is a meeting at the Caverne
               du Bois. If you would come...

     He stops when Sacha brings the drink to Laszlo.

     Corina finishes her song, and the crowd applauds quite
     enthusiastically.

     Ilsa sits alone at her table.

                          ILSA
                    (to waiter)
               Will you ask the piano player to
               come over here, please?

                          WAITER
               Very well, Mademoiselle.

     Renault comes up to the bar near Berger and Laszlo.

                          RENAULT
               How's the jewelry business, Berger?

                          BERGER
               Er, not so good.
                    (to Sacha)
               May I have my check, please?

                          RENAULT
               Too bad you weren't here earlier,
               Monsieur Laszlo. We had quite a bit
               of excitement this evening, didn't
               we, Berger?

                          BERGER
               Er, yes. Excuse me, gentlemen.

                          LASZLO
               My bill.

                          RENAULT
               No. Two champagne cocktails,
               please.

                          SACHA
               Yes, sir.

     Sam wheels in the piano to Ilsa's table. On his face is that
     funny fear.

     Ilsa herself is not as self-possessed as she tries to appear.
     There is something behind this, some mystery.

                          ILSA
               Hello, Sam.

                          SAM
               Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected
               to see you again.

     He sits down and is ready to play.

                          ILSA
               It's been a long time.

                          SAM
               Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under
               the bridge.

                          ILSA
               Some of the old songs, Sam.

                          SAM
               Yes, ma'am.

     Sam begins to play a number. He is nervous, waiting for
     anything.

                          ILSA
               Where is Rick?

                          SAM
                    (evading)
               I don't know. I ain't seen him all
               night.

     Sam looks very uncomfortable.

                          ILSA
               When will he be back?

                          SAM
               Not tonight no more. He ain't
               coming. Uh, he went home.

                          ILSA
               Does he always leave so early?

                          SAM
               Oh, he never... well...
                    (desperately)
               he's got a girl up at the Blue
               Parrot. He goes up there all the
               time.

                          ILSA
               You used to be a much better liar,
               Sam.

                          SAM
               Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're
               bad luck to him.

                          ILSA
               Play it once, Sam, for old time's
               sake.

                          SAM
               I don't know what you mean, Miss
               Ilsa.

                          ILSA
               Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes
               By."

                          SAM
               Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa.
               I'm a little rusty on it.

     Of course he can. He doesn't want to play it. He seems even
     more scared now.

                          ILSA
               I'll hum it for you.

     Ilsa starts to hum.

     Sam begins to play it very softly.

                          ILSA (CONT’D)
               Sing it, Sam.

     And Sam sings.

                          SAM
               You must remember this, A kiss is
               just a kiss, A sigh is just a sigh,
               The fundamental things apply, As
               time goes by.

     The door to the gambling room opens. Rick comes swinging out.
     He's heard the music and he's livid.

                          SAM (CONT’D)
               And when two lovers woo, They both
               say I love you, On that you can
               rely, No matter what the future
               brings, As time goes by.

     Rick walks briskly up to the piano.

                          RICK
               Sam, I thought I told you never to
               play...

     As he sees Ilsa he stops short. Sam stops playing.

     Two close-ups reveal Ilsa and Rick seeing each other.

     Rick appears shocked. For a long moment he just looks at her.

     Sam prepares to move the piano away.

     Renault and Laszlo approach the table from the bar.

                          RENAULT
                    (to Ilsa)
               Well, you were asking about Rick
               and here he is. Mademoiselle, may I
               present --

                          RICK
               -- Hello, Ilsa.

                          ILSA
               Hello, Rick.

                          RENAULT
               Oh, you've already met Rick,
               Mademoiselle?

     There's no answer from either.

                          RENAULT (CONT’D)
               Well then, perhaps you also ---

                          ILSA
               -- This is Mr. Laszlo.

                          LASZLO
               How do you do?

                          RICK
               How do you do?

                          LASZLO
               One hears a great deal about Rick
               in Casablanca.

                          RICK
               And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.

                          LASZLO
               Won't you join us for a drink?

                          RENAULT
                    (laughing)
               Oh, no, Rick never --

                          RICK
               -- Thanks. I will.

     Rick sits down.

                          RENAULT
               Well! A precedent is being broken.
               Er, Emil!

                          LASZLO
               This is a very interesting cafe. I
               congratulate you.

                          RICK
               And I congratulate you.

                          LASZLO
               What for?

                          RICK
               Your work.

                          LASZLO
               Thank you. I try.

                          RICK
               We all try. You succeed.

                          RENAULT
               I can't get over you two. She was
               asking about you earlier, Rick, in
               a way that made me extremely
               jealous.

                          ILSA
                    (to Rick)
               I wasn't sure you were the same.
               Let's see, the last time we met --

                          RICK
               -- It was "La Belle Aurore."

                          ILSA
               How nice. You remembered. But of
               course, that was the day the
               Germans marched into Paris.

                          RICK
               Not an easy day to forget.

                          ILSA
               No.

                          RICK
               I remember every detail. The
               Germans wore gray, you wore blue.

                          ILSA
               Yes. I put that dress away. When
               the Germans march out, I'll wear it
               again.

                          RENAULT
               Ricky, you're becoming quite human.
               I suppose we have to thank you for
               that, Mademoiselle.

                          LASZLO
               Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to
               say it, but it's late.

                          RENAULT
                    (glancing at his
                     wristwatch)
               So it is. And we have a curfew here
               in Casablanca. It would never do
               for the Chief of Police to be found
               drinking after hours and have to
               fine himself.

     Rick and Ilsa look at each other.

     Laszlo signals the waiter

                          LASZLO
               I hope we didn't overstay our
               welcome.

                          RICK
               Not at all.

                          WAITER
                    (to Laszlo)
               Your check, sir.

     Rick takes the check.

                          RICK
                    (to waiter)
               Oh, it's my party.

                          RENAULT
               Another precedent gone. This has
               been a very interesting evening.
               I'll call you a cab. Gasoline
               rationing, time of night.

     Renault leaves.

                          LASZLO
               We'll come again.

                          RICK
               Any time.

                          ILSA
               Say goodnight to Sam for me.

                          RICK
               I will.

                          ILSA
               There's still nobody in the world
               who can play "As Time Goes By" like
               Sam.

                          RICK
               He hasn't played it in a long time.

     Ilsa smiles.

                          ILSA
               Goodnight.

                          LASZLO
               Goodnight.

                          RICK
               Goodnight.

     Rick and Laszlo nod goodnight to each other. Laszlo and Ilsa
     start to the door as Rick sits down again and stares off in
     their direction.

                                                        CUT TO:


     EXT. RICK'S CAFE - NIGHT

     Ilsa and Laszlo leave the cafe.

                          LASZLO
               A very puzzling fellow, this Rick.
               What sort is he?

     Ilsa doesn't look at him.

                          ILSA
               Oh, I really can't say, though I
               saw him quite often in Paris.

     They join Renault at the curb.

                          RENAULT
               Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's
               office.

                          LASZLO
               We'll be there.

                          RENAULT
               Goodnight.

                          ILSA
               Goodnight.

                          LASZLO
               Goodnight.

     They get into a waiting cab, leaving Renault on the curb,
     smoking and looking bemused.

     The neon sign goes off and the doorway is now illuminated by
     the revolving beacon from the airport.

                                                        CUT TO:


     INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

     The customers have all gone. The house lights are out.

     Rick sits alone at a table. There is a glass of bourbon on
     the table directly in front of him, and another empty glass
     on the table before an empty chair. Near at hand is a bottle.

     He fills his glass and drinks it quickly.

     Rick just sits. His face is entirely expressionless. The
     beacon light from the airport sweeps around the room creating
     a mood of unreality.

     Sam comes in and stands hesitantly beside Rick.

                          SAM
               Boss.

     No answer, as Rick drinks.

                          SAM (CONT’D)
               Boss!

                          RICK
               Yeah?

                          SAM
               Boss, ain't you going to bed?

                          RICK
               Not right now.

     Sam now realizes Rick is in a very grim mood.

                          SAM
                    (lightly)
               Ain't you planning on going to bed
               in the near future?

                          RICK
               No.

                          SAM
               You ever going to bed?

                          RICK
               No.

                          SAM
               Well, I ain't sleepy either.

                          RICK
               Good. Then have a drink.

                          SAM
               No. Not me, boss.

                          RICK
               Then don't have a drink.

                          SAM
               Boss, let's get out of here.

                          RICK
                    (emphatically)
               No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.

                          SAM
                    (earnestly)
               Please, boss, let's go. Ain't
               nothing but trouble for you here.

                          RICK
               She's coming back. I know she's
               coming back.

                          SAM
               We'll take the car and drive all
               night. We'll get drunk. We'll go
               fishing and stay away until she's
               gone.

                          RICK
               Shut up and go home, will you?

                          SAM
                    (stubbornly)
               No, sir. I'm staying right here.

     Sam sits down at the piano and starts to play softly,

     improvising.

                          RICK
               They grab Ugarte and she walks in.
               Well, that's the way it goes. One
               in, one out. Sam?

                          SAM
               Yeah, boss?

                          RICK
               Sam, if it's December 1941 in
               Casablanca, what time is it in New
               York?

                          SAM
               Uh, my watch stopped.

                          RICK
               I bet they're asleep in New York.
               I'll bet they're asleep all over
               America.

     Suddenly he pounds the table and buries his head in his arms.
     Then he raises his head, trying to regain control.

                          RICK (CONT’D)
               Of all the gin joints in all the
               towns in all the world, she walks
               into mine.

     He holds his head in his hands.

                          RICK (CONT’D)
               What's that you're playing?

                          SAM
               Just a little something of my own.

                          RICK
               Well, stop it. You know what I want
               to hear.

                          SAM
               No, I don't.

                          RICK
               You played it for her and you can
               play it for me.

                          SAM
               Well, I don't think I can remember
               it.

                          RICK
               If she can stand it, I can. Play
               it!

                          SAM
               Yes, boss.

     Sam starts to play "As Time Goes By."

     Rick just stares ahead as orchestra MUSIC slowly joins Sam's
     playing.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


     MONTAGE - PARIS IN THE SPRING

     A) The Arc de Triomphe from a distance.

     B) Rick drives a small, open car slowly along the boulevard.

     He puts his arm around Ilsa. The background scenery changes
     to a country road as she snuggles close to him and puts her
     head on his shoulder.

     C) An excursion boat on the Seine. Rick and Ilsa stand at the
     rail of the boat. They seem to be transported by each other
     as Ilsa laughs.

     INT. RICK'S PARIS APARTMENT - DAY

     Ilsa fixes flowers at the window while Rick opens champagne.

     She walks over and joins him.

                          RICK
               Who are you really? And what were
               you before? What did you do and
               what did you think? Huh?

                          ILSA
               We said "no questions."

                          RICK
               Here's looking at you, kid.

     They drink.

     INT. PARIS CAFE - NIGHT

     Inside a swank Paris cafe, Rick and Ilsa dance. They appear
     to be very much in love as the MUSIC plays.

     INT. ILSA'S PARIS APARTMENT - DAY

     Ilsa flips a coin, then tosses it over to Rick.

                          ILSA
               A franc for your thoughts.

                          RICK
               In America they'd bring only a
               penny. I guess that's about all
               they're worth.

                          ILSA
               I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell
               me.

                          RICK
               And I was wondering.

                          ILSA
               Yes?

                          RICK
               Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find
               you waiting for me to come along.

                          ILSA
               Why there is no other man in my
               life?

                          RICK
               Uh huh.

                          ILSA
               That's easy. There was. He's dead.

                          RICK
               I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we
               said "no questions."

                          ILSA
               Well, only one answer can take care
               of all our questions.

     They kiss passionately.

     A man sells newspapers to people crowded around him. There is
     much excitement. Rick and Ilsa sit at a table. They buy a
     newspaper and begin to read it.

     Nearby, a group of frightened French people cluster around a
     loudspeaker on a wagon. A harsh voice barks out the tragic
     news of the Nazi push toward Paris.

                          RICK
               Nothing can stop them now.
               Wednesday, Thursday at the latest,
               they'll be in Paris.

               here.

                          RICK
               I'm on their blacklist already,
               their roll of honor.

     INT. LA BELLE AURORE - AFTERNOON

     A small cafe in the Montmartre. A shadow on the floor
     reflects the cafe sign "La Belle Aurore."

     Rick, at the bar, gets glasses and a bottle of champagne.

     He walks over to Ilsa and Sam at the piano.

     Sam plays "As Time Goes By."

     Ilsa seems unnerved. There is evidently something on her
     mind.

     Rick pours the champagne. His manner is wry, but not the
     bitter wryness we have seen in Casablanca.

                          RICK
               Henri wants us to finish this
               bottle and then three more. He says
               he'll water his garden with
               champagne before he'll let the
               Germans drink any of it.

     Sam looks at his glass.

                          SAM
               This sort of takes the sting out of
               being occupied, doesn't it, Mr.
               Richard?

                          RICK
               You said it!
                    (to Ilsa)
               Here's looking at you, kid.

     Suddenly a loudspeaker BLARES out something in German. Rick
     and Ilsa look at each other, then hurry to the window.

                          RICK (CONT’D)
               My German's a little rusty.

                          ILSA
               It's the Gestapo. They say they
               expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
               They are telling us how to act when
               they come marching in.

     She smiles faintly.

                          ILSA (CONT’D)
               With the whole world crumbling, we
               pick this time to fall in love.

                          RICK
               Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where
               were you, say, ten years ago?

                          ILSA
               Ten years ago? Let's see...
                    (pause as she thinks a
                     bit)
               ...Yes. I was having a brace put on
               my teeth. Where were you?

                          RICK
               Looking for a job.

     Ilsa looks at him tenderly. Rick takes her in his arms, and
     kisses her hungrily. While they are locked in an embrace they
     hear the dull BOOM of cannons.

                          ILSA
                    (frightened)
               Was that cannon fire, or is it my
               heart pounding?

                          RICK
                    (grimly)
               Ah, that's the new German 77. And
               judging by the sound, only about
               thirty-five miles away.

     Another BOOM from the cannons.

                          RICK (CONT’D)
               And getting closer every minute.
               Here. Drink up. We'll never finish
               the other three.

                          SAM
               The Germans'll be here pretty soon
               now, and they'll come looking for
               you. And don't forget there's a
               price on your head.

     Ilsa reacts to this worriedly.

                          RICK
               I left a note in my apartment.
               They'll know where to find me.

     Ilsa looks at Rick.

                          ILSA
               Strange. I know so very little
               about you.

                          RICK
               I know very little about you, just
               the fact that you had your teeth
               straightened.

     He chuckles.

                          ILSA
               But be serious, darling. You are in
               danger and you must leave Paris.

                          RICK
               No, no, no, no. We must leave.

                          ILSA
                    (seriously)
               Yes, of course, we --

                          RICK
               -- The train for Marseilles leaves
               at five o'clock. I'll pick you up
               at your hotel at four-thirty.

                          ILSA
                    (quickly)
               No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I
               have things to do in the city
               before I leave. I'll meet you at
               the station, huh?

                          RICK
               All right. At a quarter to five.
                    (a thought strikes him)
               Say, why don't we get married in
               Marseilles?

     Rick chuckles again.

                          ILSA
                    (evasively)
               That's too far ahead to plan.

                          RICK
               Yes, I guess it is a little too far
               ahead. Well, let's see. What about
               the engineer? Why can't he marry us
               on the train?

                          ILSA
               Oh, darling!

     Suddenly Ilsa turns away and starts to cry.

                          RICK
               Well, why not? The captain on a
               ship can. It doesn't seem fair
               that... Hey, hey, what's wrong,
               kid?

                          ILSA
               I love you so much, and I hate this
               war so much. Oh, it's a crazy
               world. Anything can happen. If you
               shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if
               something should keep us apart,
               wherever they put you and wherever
               I'll be, I want you to know...

     She can't go on. She lifts her face to his. He kisses her
     gently.

                          ILSA (CONT’D)
               Kiss me. Kiss me as if it were the
               last time.

     He looks into her eyes, then he does kiss her as though it
     were going to be the last time.

     Her hand falls to the table and knocks over a glass.

                                                        CUT TO:


     INT. GARE DE LYON - NIGHT

     It's raining very hard at the train station.

     There is a hectic, fevered excitement, evident in the faces
     of the people that pass by. This is the last train from
     Paris.

     Rick appears in the crowd. He stops and puts his suitcase
     down and glances at his watch.

     A conductor calls out "All aboard, last train leaving in
     three minutes."

     Rain pours over his head and shoulders, but he doesn't seem
     to notice. He nervously checks his watch again.

     Suddenly Sam appears.

                          RICK
               Where is she? Have you seen her?

                          SAM
               No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.
               She checked out of the hotel. But
               this note came just after you left.

     Sam pulls an envelope from his pocket. Rick grabs it, opens
     it, and stares down at the letter.


     INSERT LETTER
     Richard,
     I cannot go with you or ever see you
     again. You must not ask why. Just
     believe that I love you. Go, my
     darling, and God bless you.

     Ilsa

     Raindrops pour down the letter, smudging the writing.


     BACK TO SCENE

     A whistle BLOWS.

                          SAM
                    (frantically)
               That's the last call, Mr. Richard,
               do you hear me? Come on, Mr.
               Richard. Let's get out of here.
               Come on, Mr. Richard, come on.

     Sam pulls a stunned, reluctant Rick to the train. The train
     starts to move just as he boards.

     From the steps he looks off into the distance, then crumbles
     the letter and tosses it away as the steam from the engine
     clouds over him.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


     INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

     Close-up of a glass on the table in the cafe. Rick's hand
     reaches for it and knocks it over. We now see Rick's face and
     he's very drunk.

     Sam walks over to the table to pick up the glass and a fallen
     chair.

     Just then the door opens and it's Ilsa. Rick stares at the
     doorway. Ilsa lingers a moment, then comes over to the table.

                          ILSA
               Rick, I have to talk to you.

     Her manner is a little uncertain, a little tentative, but
     with a quiet determination beneath it.

                          RICK
               Oh. I saved my first drink to have
               with you. Here.

                          ILSA
               No. No, Rick. Not tonight.

                          RICK
               Especially tonight.

     She sits down in the chair before the empty glass. Her eyes
     are searching his face, but there is no expression on it
     except a cold and impassive one.

     Rick reaches for the bottle, and pours himself another drink.

                          ILSA
               Please.

                          RICK
               Why did you have to come to
               Casablanca? There are other places.

                          ILSA
               I wouldn't have come if I had known
               that you were here. Believe me,
               Rick, it's true. I didn't know.

                          RICK
               It's funny about your voice, how it
               hasn't changed. I can still hear
               it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you
               any place. We'll get on a train
               together and never stop."

                          ILSA
               Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can
               understand how you feel.

                          RICK
               Huh! You understand how I feel. How
               long was it we had, honey?

                          ILSA
               I didn't count the days.

                          RICK
               Well, I did. Every one of them.
               Mostly I remember the last one. A
               wow finish. A guy standing on a
               station platform in the rain with a
               comical look on his face, because
               his insides had been kicked out.

     He takes a drink.

                          ILSA
               Can I tell you a story, Rick?

                          RICK
               Has it got a wow finish?

                          ILSA
               I don't know the finish yet.

                          RICK
               Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one
               will come to you as you go along.

                          ILSA
               It's about a girl who had just come
               to Paris from her home in Oslo. At
               the house of some friends she met a
               man about whom she'd heard her
               whole life, a very great and
               courageous man. He opened up for
               her a whole beautiful world full of
               knowledge and thoughts and ideals.
               Everything she knew or ever became
               was because of him. And she looked
               up to him and worshipped him with a
               feeling she supposed was love.

                          RICK
               Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a
               story once. As a matter of fact,
               I've heard a lot of stories in my
               time. They went along with the
               sound of a tinny piano playing in
               the parlor downstairs, "Mister, I
               met a man once when I was a kid,"
               it'd always begin. Huh. I guess
               neither one of our stories was very
               funny. Tell me, who was it you left
               me for? Was it Laszlo, or were
               there others in between? Or aren't
               you the kind that tells?

     Ilsa gets up and leaves.

     Rick's head slumps over the table.

                                                        CUT TO:


     INT. RENAULT'S OFFICE - MORNING

     A sign on the door reads: Captain Renault, Prefect de Police.

     Strasser sits while Renault attends to some paperwork.

                          STRASSER
               I strongly suspect that Ugarte left
               the letters of transit with Mr.
               Blaine. I would suggest you search
               the cafe immediately and
               thoroughly.

                          RENAULT
               If Rick has the letters, he's much
               too smart to let you find them
               there.

                          STRASSER
               You give him credit for too much
               cleverness. My impression was that
               he's just another blundering
               American.

                          RENAULT
               But we mustn't underestimate
               American blundering. I was with
               them when they "blundered" into
               Berlin in 1918.

     Strasser looks at him.

                          STRASSER
               As to Laszlo, we want him watched
               twenty-four hours a day.

                          RENAULT
                    (reassuringly)
               It may interest you to know that at
               this very moment he is on his way
               here.

     INT. PREFECTURE LOBBY - MORNING

     Laszlo and Ilsa make their way through the jam in the lobby
     of the Prefecture.

     Jan and Annina talk to an officer.

                          OFFICER
                    (to Jan and Annina)
               There's nothing we can do.

     INT. RENAULT'S OFFICE - MORNING

     Laszlo and Ilsa enter Renault's office.

     Renault bows to them both.

                          RENAULT
               I am delighted to see you both. Did
               you have a good night's rest?

                          LASZLO
               I slept very well.

                          RENAULT
               That's strange. Nobody is supposed
               to sleep well in Casablanca.

                          LASZLO
                    (coldly)
               May we proceed with the business?

                          RENAULT
               With pleasure. Won't you sit down?

                          LASZLO
               Thank you.

     They take their seats.

                          STRASSER
                    (now as cold as Laszlo)
               Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not
               mince words. You are an escaped
               prisoner of the Reich. So far you
               have been fortunate enough in
               eluding us. You have reached
               Casablanca. It is my duty to see
               that you stay in Casablanca.

                          LASZLO
               Whether or not you succeed is, of
               course, problematical.

                          STRASSER
               Not at all. Captain Renault's
               signature is necessary on every
               exit visa.
                    (turns to Renault)
               Captain, would you think it is
               possible that Herr Laszlo will
               receive a visa?

                          RENAULT
               I am afraid not. My regrets,
               Monsieur.

                          LASZLO
               Well, perhaps I shall like it in
               Casablanca.

                          STRASSER
               And Mademoiselle?

                          ILSA
               You needn't be concerned about me.

                          LASZLO
               Is that all you wish to tell us?

                          STRASSER
               Don't be in such a hurry. You have
               all the time in the world. You may
               be in Casablanca indefinitely... or
               you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow,
               on one condition.

                          LASZLO
               And that is?

                          STRASSER
               You know the leaders of the
               underground movement in Paris, in
               Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam,
               in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.

                          LASZLO
               Even in Berlin.

                          STRASSER
               Yes, even in Berlin. If you will
               furnish me with their names and
               their exact whereabouts, you will
               have your visa in the morning.

                          RENAULT
               And the honor of having served the
               Third Reich.

                          LASZLO
               I was in a German concentration
               camp for a year. That's honor
               enough for a lifetime.

                          STRASSER
               You will give us the names?

                          LASZLO
               If I didn't give them to you in a
               concentration camp where you had
               more "persuasive methods" at your
               disposal, I certainly won't give
               them to you now.

     The passionate conviction in his voice now reveals the
     crusader.

                          LASZLO (CONT’D)
               And what if you track down these
               men and kill them? What if you
               murdered all of us? From every
               corner of Europe, hundreds,
               thousands, would rise to take our
               places. Even Nazis can't kill that
               fast.

                          STRASSER
               Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation
               for eloquence which I can now
               understand. But in one respect you
               are mistaken. You said the enemies
               of the Reich could all be replaced,
               but there is one exception. No one
               could take your place in the event
               anything unfortunate should occur
               to you while you were trying to
               escape.

                          LASZLO
               You won't dare to interfere with me
               here. This is still unoccupied
               France. Any violation of neutrality
               would reflect on Captain Renault.

                          RENAULT
               Monsieur, insofar as it is in my
               power --

                          LASZLO
               -- Thank you.

                          RENAULT
               By the way, Monsieur, last night
               you evinced an interest in Signor
               Ugarte.

                          LASZLO
               Yes.

                          RENAULT
               I believe you have a message for
               him?

                          LASZLO
               Nothing important, but may I speak
               to him now?

                          STRASSER
               You would find the conversation a
               trifle one-sided. Signor Ugarte is
               dead.

     Close-ups of Ilsa, then Laszlo, reveal their disappointment.

     Strasser observes their reaction.

                          ILSA
                    (softly)
               Oh.

     Renault holds a report.

                          RENAULT
               I am making out the report now. We
               haven't quite decided whether he
               committed suicide or died trying to
               escape.

                          LASZLO
               Are you quite finished with us?

                          STRASSER
               For the time being.

                          LASZLO
               Good day.

     Renault rings a buzzer and the door is opened for them.

     As Ilsa and Laszlo leave, an OFFICER comes in.

                          RENAULT
               Undoubtedly their next step will be
               to the black market.

                          OFFICER
               Excuse me, Captain. Another visa
               problem has come up.

                          RENAULT
               Show her in.

                          OFFICER
               Yes, sir.

     Renault looks at himself in the mirror and straightens his
     tie.

     EXT. BLACK MARKET - DAY

     The black market is a cluttered Arab street of bazaars, shops
     and stalls. All kinds and races of people mill about the
     merchandise which native dealers have on outdoor display.

     Both men and women are dressed in tropical clothes. The
     canopies over the stalls give them some protection from the
     scorching sun.

     On the surface the atmosphere is merely languid, but
     underneath lies the sinister workings of illicit trade.

     A FRENCHMAN and a NATIVE huddle together and talk in low
     tones.

                          NATIVE
               I'm sorry, Monsieur, we would have
               to handle the police. This is a job
               for Signor Ferrari.

                          FRENCHMAN
               Ferrari?

                          NATIVE
               It can be most helpful to know
               Signor Ferrari. He pretty near has
               a monopoly on the black market
               here. You will find him over there
               at the Blue Parrot.

                          FRENCHMAN
               Thanks.

     EXT. THE BLUE PARROT - DAY

     Outside the cafe, a blue parrot sits on a perch.

                                                        CUT TO:


     INT. THE BLUE PARROT - DAY

     The cafe is much less pretentious than Rick's, but well
     populated.

     Rick enters and walks through the cafe toward Ferrari's
     office just as Ferrari emerges with Jan and Annina, who look
     very disappointed.

                          FERRARI
               There, don't be too downhearted.
               Perhaps you can come to terms with
               Captain Renault.

                          JAN
               Thank you very much, Signor.

     Jan leads Annina away.

                          RICK
               Hello, Ferrari.

     Signor Ferrari turns around. He's pleased to see Rick.

                          FERRARI
               Ah, good morning, Rick.

     They shake hands.

                          RICK
               I see the bus is in. I'll take my
               shipment with me.

                          FERRARI
               No hurry. I'll have it sent over.
               Have a drink with me.

                          RICK
               I never drink in the morning. And
               every time you send my shipment
               over, it's always just a little bit
               short.

                          FERRARI
                    (chuckling)
               Carrying charges, my boy, carrying
               charges. Here, sit down. There's
               something I want to talk over with
               you, anyhow.

     He hails a waiter.

                          FERRARI (CONT’D)
               The bourbon.
                    (to Rick, sighing deeply)
               The news about Ugarte upset me very
               much.

                          RICK
               You're a fat hypocrite. You don't
               feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I
               do.

     He eyes Rick closely.

                          FERRARI
               Of course not. What upsets me is
               the fact that Ugarte is dead and no
               one knows where those letters of
               transit are.

                          RICK
               Practically no one.

                          FERRARI
               If I could lay my hands on those
               letters, I could make a fortune.

                          RICK
               So could I. And I'm a poor
               businessman.

                          FERRARI
               I have a proposition for whoever
               has those letters. I will handle
               the entire transaction, get rid of
               the letters, take all the risk, for
               a small percentage.

                          RICK
               And the carrying charges?

                          FERRARI
               Naturally there will be a few
               incidental expenses. That is the
               proposition I have for whoever has
               those letters.

                          RICK
                    (dryly)
               I'll tell him when he comes in.

                          FERRARI
               Rick, I'll put my cards on the
               table. I think you know where those
               letters are.

                          RICK
               Well, you're in good company.
               Renault and Strasser probably think
               so, too.

     Rick looks out of the window and sees Ilsa at the linen
     bazaar, then Laszlo walking toward the cafe.

                          RICK (CONT’D)
               That's why I came over here to give
               them a chance to ransack my place.

                          FERRARI
               Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into
               your confidence. You need a
               partner.

     Rick isn't listening to him. He looks through the open window
     in the direction of the linen bazaar.

     Rick gets up.

                          RICK
               Excuse me, I'll be getting back.

                                                        CUT TO:


     EXT. THE BLUE PARROT - DAY

     Laszlo reaches the entrance to the cafe as Rick comes out.

     He stops and addresses Rick politely.

                          LASZLO
               Good morning.

                          RICK
               Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at
               the table.

     As he exits, Laszlo looks after him with a puzzled
     expression.

                                                        CUT TO:


     EXT. BLACK MARKET - DAY

     At the linen stall, Ilsa examines a tablecloth which an Arab
     vendor is endeavoring to sell. He holds a sign which reads
     "700 francs."

                          ARAB
               You will not find a treasure like
               this in all Morocco, Mademoiselle.
               Only seven hundred francs.

     Rick walks up behind Ilsa.

                          RICK
               You're being cheated.

     She looks briefly at Rick, then turns away. Her manner is
     politely formal.

                          ILSA
               It doesn't matter, thank you.

                          ARAB
               Ah, the lady is a friend of Rick's?
               For friends of Rick we have a small
               discount. Did I say seven hundred
               francs? You can have it for two
               hundred.

     Reaching under the counter, he takes out a sign reading "200
     francs", and replaces the other sign with it.

                          RICK
               I'm sorry I was in no condition to
               receive you when you called on me
               last night.

                          ILSA
               It doesn't matter.

                          ARAB
               Ah, for special friends of Rick's
               we have a special discount. One
               hundred francs.

     He replaces the second sign with a third which reads "100
     francs."

                          RICK
               Your story had me a little
               confused. Or maybe it was the
               bourbon.

                          ARAB
               I have some tablecloths, some
               napkins --

                          ILSA
               -- Thank you. I'm really not
               interested.

                          ARAB
               Please, one minute. Wait!

     The Arab hurriedly exits.

     Ilsa pretends to examine the goods on the counter.

                          RICK
               Why did you come back? To tell me
               why you ran out on me at the
               railway station?

                          ILSA
               Yes.

                          RICK
               Well, you can tell me now. I'm
               reasonably sober.

                          ILSA
               I don't think I will, Rick.

                          RICK
               Why not? After all, I got stuck
               with a railway ticket. I think I'm
               entitled to know.

                          ILSA
               Last night I saw what has happened
               to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I
               could tell him. He'd understand.
               But the one who looked at me with
               such hatred... well, I'll be
               leaving Casablanca soon and we'll
               never see each other again. We knew
               very little about each other when
               we were in love in Paris. If we
               leave it that way, maybe we'll
               remember those days and not
               Casablanca, not last night.

                          RICK
               Did you run out on me because you
               couldn't take it? Because you knew
               what it would be like, hiding from
               the police, running away all the
               time?

                          ILSA
               You can believe that if you want
               to.

                          RICK
               Well, I'm not running away any
               more. I'm settled now, above a
               saloon, it's true, but... walk up a
               flight. I'll be expecting you.

     Ilsa turns her head away.

                          RICK (CONT’D)
               All the same, someday you'll lie to
               Laszlo. You'll be there.

                          ILSA
               No, Rick. No, you see, Victor
               Laszlo is my husband... and was,
               even when I knew you in Paris.

     She walks away into the cafe as Rick stares after her in
     stunned disbelief.

                                                        CUT TO:


     INT. THE BLUE PARROT - DAY

     Ilsa and Laszlo sit with Ferrari.

                          FERRARI
               I was just telling Monsieur Laszlo
               that, unfortunately, I am not able
               to help him.

                          ILSA
               Oh.

                          LASZLO
               You see, my dear, the word has gone
               around.

                          FERRARI
                    (to Ilsa)
               As leader of all illegal activities
               in Casablanca, I am an influential
               and respected man. It would not be
               worth my life to do anything for
               Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are
               a different matter.

                          LASZLO
               Signor Ferrari thinks it might just
               be possible to get an exit visa for
               you.

                          ILSA
               You mean for me to go on alone?

                          FERRARI
               And only alone.

                          LASZLO
               I will stay here and keep on
               trying. I'm sure in a little while
               --

                          FERRARI
               -- We might as well be frank,
               Monsieur. It will take a miracle to
               get you out of Casablanca. And the
               Germans have outlawed miracles.

                          ILSA
               We are only interested in two
               visas, Signor.

                          LASZLO
               Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.

                          ILSA
                    (firmly)
               No, Victor, no.

                          FERRARI
               You two will want to discuss this.
               Excuse me. I'll be at the bar.

     Ferrari gets to his feet and walks away.

                          LASZLO
               No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay
               here. You must get to America. And
               believe me, somehow I will get out
               and join you.

                          ILSA
               But, Victor, if the situation were
               different, if I had to stay and
               there were only a visa for one,
               would you take it?

                          LASZLO
                    (not very convincingly)
               Yes, I would.

     Ilsa smiles faintly. She doesn't believe it for even a
     moment.

                          ILSA
               Yes, I see. When I had trouble
               getting out of Lille, why didn't
               you leave me there? And when I was
               sick in Marseilles and held you up
               for two weeks and you were in
               danger every minute of the time,
               why didn't you leave me then?

                          LASZLO
               I meant to, but something always
               held me up. I love you very much,
               Ilsa.

     She smiles again.

                          ILSA
               Your secret will be safe with me.
               Ferrari is waiting for our answer.

     At the bar Ferrari talks to a waiter.

                          FERRARI
               Not more than fifty francs though.

     Ilsa and Laszlo walk up to him.

                          LASZLO
               We've decided, Signor Ferrari. For
               the present we'll go on looking for
               two exit visas. Thank you very
               much.

                          FERRARI
               Well, good luck. But be careful.
                    (a flick of his eyes in
                     the direction of the
                     bazaar)
               You know you're being shadowed?

     Laszlo glances in the direction of the bazaar.

                          LASZLO
               Of course. It becomes an instinct.

     Ferrari looks shrewdly at Ilsa.

                          FERRARI
               I observe that you in one respect
               are a very fortunate man, Monsieur.
               I am moved to make one more
               suggestion, why, I do not know,
               because it cannot possibly profit
               me, but, have you heard about
               Signor Ugarte and the letters of
               transit?

                          LASZLO
               Yes, something.

                          FERRARI
               Those letters were not found on
               Ugarte when they arrested him.

     There's a moments pause as this sinks in.

                          LASZLO
               Do you know where they are?

                          FERRARI
               Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will
               venture to guess that Ugarte left
               those letters with Monsieur Rick.

     Ilsa's face darkens. Laszlo quietly observes.

                          LASZLO
               Rick?

                          FERRARI
               He is a difficult customer, that
               Rick. One never knows what he'll do
               or why. But it is worth a chance.

                          LASZLO
               Thank you very much. Good day.

                          ILSA
               Goodbye, thank you for your coffee,
               Signor. I shall miss that when we
               leave Casablanca.

     Ferrari bows.

                          FERRARI
               It was gracious of you to share it
               with me. Good day, Mademoiselle,
               Monsieur.

                          LASZLO
               Good day.

     As Ilsa and Laszlo leave the cafe, Ferrari nonchalantly swats
     a fly on a table.

                                                        CUT TO:


     EXT. RICK'S CAFE - NIGHT

     Outside Rick's cafe, the sign is lit up and MUSIC filters out
     into the air.

                                                        CUT TO:


     INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

     At the bar, the European has found another TOURIST.

                          EUROPEAN
               Here's to you, sir.

                          TOURIST
               Er, good luck, yes.

                          EUROPEAN
               I'd better be going.

                          TOURIST
               Er, my check, please.

                          EUROPEAN
               I have to warn you, sir. I beseech
               you...

     The European picks his pocket.

                          EUROPEAN (CONT’D)
               This is a dangerous place, full of
               vultures. Vultures everywhere!
               Thanks for everything.

     The tourist laughs.

                          TOURIST
               Er, goodbye, sir.

                          EUROPEAN
               It has been a pleasure to meet you.

     He dashes off and collides with Carl.

                          EUROPEAN (CONT’D)
               Oh, I'm sorry.

     As the European hurries away, Carl checks all his pockets to
     make sure nothing is missing.

     Sam and Corina play a number, accompanied by the orchestra.

     Strasser and his crowd enter the cafe and pass Rick's table.

     Carl brings Rick a bottle and glass.

                          CARL
               Monsieur Rick, you are getting to
               be your best customer.

     Carl leaves.

     As Rick lights a cigarette, Renault shows up.

                          RENAULT
               Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with
               you. Now you're beginning to live
               like a Frenchman.

                          RICK
               That was some going-over your men
               gave my place this afternoon. We
               just barely got cleaned up in time
               to open.

     He pours a drink for Renault.

                          RENAULT
               Well, I told Strasser he wouldn't
               find the letters here. But I told
               my men to be especially
               destructive. You know how that
               impresses Germans?
                    (taking a sip)
               Rick, have you got these letters of
               transit?

                          RICK
               Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free
               French?

                          RENAULT
               Serves me right for asking a direct
               question. The subject is closed.

                          RICK
               Well, it looks like you're a little
               late.

                          RENAULT
               Huh?

     Rick gazes at Yvonne and a GERMAN OFFICER approaching the
     bar.

                          RICK
               So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.

                          RENAULT
               Who knows? In her own way she may
               constitute an entire second front.
               I think it's time for me to flatter
               Major Strasser a little. I'll see
               you later, Rick.

     Renault gets up and strolls away.

     At the bar, Yvonne and the German officer place their orders.

                          YVONNE
               Sacha!

                          GERMAN OFFICER
               French seventy-fives.

     Yvonne is somewhat drunk already.

                          YVONNE
               Put up a whole row of them,
               Sacha... starting here and ending
               here.

     She indicates with her hand where she wants them.

                          GERMAN OFFICER
               We will begin with two.

     A FRENCH OFFICER at the bar makes a remark to Yvonne.

                          FRENCH OFFICER
                    (in French)
               Say, you, you are not French to go
               with a German like this!

                          YVONNE
                    (in French)
               What are you butting in for?

                          FRENCH OFFICER
                    (in French)
               I am butting in --

                          YVONNE
                    (breaking in, in French)
               -- It's none of your business!

                          GERMAN OFFICER
                    (in French)
               No, no, no, no! One minute!
                    (in English)
               What did you say? Would you kindly
               repeat it?

                          FRENCH OFFICER
               What I said is none of your
               business!

                          GERMAN OFFICER
               I will make it my business!

     They begin to fight.

                          YVONNE
                    (in French)
               Stop! I beg of you! I beg of you,
               stop!

     There are exclamations from people nearby. German officers at
     a nearby table rise, ready to join in. Rick walks up and
     separates the two men.

                          RICK
                    (to the German)
               I don't like disturbances in my
               place. Either lay off politics or
               get out.

                          FRENCH OFFICER
                    (in French)
               Dirty Boche. Someday we'll have our
               revenge!

     Renault, Strasser and the other officers sit down again.

                          STRASSER
               You see, Captain, the situation is
               not as much under control as you
               believe.

                          RENAULT
               My dear Major, we are trying to
               cooperate with your government, but
               we cannot regulate the feelings of
               our people.

     Strasser eyes him closely.

                          STRASSER
               Captain Renault, are you entirely
               certain which side you're on?

                          RENAULT
               I have no conviction, if that's
               what you mean. I blow with the
               wind, and the prevailing wind
               happens to be from Vichy.

                          STRASSER
               And if it should change?

     He smiles.

                          RENAULT
               Surely the Reich doesn't admit that
               possibility?

     Renault lights a cigarette and puffs away.

                          STRASSER
               We are concerned about more than
               Casablanca. We know that every
               French province in Africa is honey-
               combed with traitors waiting for
               their chance, waiting, perhaps, for
               a leader.

                          RENAULT
                    (casually)
               A leader, like Laszlo?

                          STRASSER
               Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It
               is too dangerous if we let him go.
               It may be too dangerous if we let
               him stay.

                          RENAULT
                    (thoughtfully)
               I see what you mean.

     Carl, bottle in hand, approaches the table of a middle-aged
     German couple, the LEUCHTAGS.

                          CARL
                    (in German)
               I brought you the finest brandy.
               Only the employees drink it here.

     He pours a drink for each of them.

                          MR. LEUCHTAG
               Thank you, Carl.

                          CARL
                    (as he pours)
               For Mrs. Leuchtag.

                          MRS. LEUCHTAG
               Thank you, Carl.

                          CARL
               For Mr. Leuchtag.

                          MR. LEUCHTAG
               Carl, sit down. Have a brandy with
               us.

                          MRS. LEUCHTAG
                    (beaming with happiness)
               To celebrate our leaving for
               America tomorrow.

     Carl sits down.

                          CARL
               Thank you very much. I thought you
               would ask me, so I brought the good
               brandy and a third glass.

     He produces a glass from a back pocket.

                          MRS. LEUCHTAG
               At last the day has came.

                          MR. LEUCHTAG
               Frau Leuchtag and I are speaking
               nothing but English now.

                          MRS. LEUCHTAG
               So we should feel at home ven ve
               get to America.

                          CARL
               A very nice idea.

                          MR. LEUCHTAG
                    (raising his glass)
               To America.

     Mrs. Leuchtag and Carl repeat "To America." They clink
     glasses and drink.

                          MR. LEUCHTAG (CONT’D)
               Liebchen, uh, sweetness heart, what
               watch?

     She glances at her wristwatch.

                          MRS. LEUCHTAG
               Ten watch.

                          MR. LEUCHTAG
                    (surprised)
               Such much?

                          CARL
               Er, you will get along beautifully
               in America, huh.

     Annina meets Renault in the hallway as she leaves the
     gambling room,

                          RENAULT
               How's lady luck treating you? Aw,
               too bad. You'll find him over
               there.

     Annina sees Rick and goes to his table.

                          ANNINA
               Monsieur Rick?

                          RICK
               Yes?

                          ANNINA
               Could I speak to you for just a
               moment, please?

     Rick looks at her.

                          RICK
               How did you get in here? You're
               under age.

                          ANNINA
               I came with Captain Renault.

                          RICK
                    (cynically)
               I should have known.

                          ANNINA
               My husband is with me, too.

                          RICK
               He is? Well, Captain Renault's
               getting broadminded. Sit down. Will
               you have a drink?

     Annina shakes her head.

                          RICK (CONT’D)
               No, of course not. Do you mind if I
               do?

                          ANNINA
               No.

     Rick pours himself a drink

                          ANNINA (CONT’D)
               Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is
               Captain Renault?

                          RICK
               Oh, he's just like any other man,
               only more so.

                          ANNINA
               No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is
               his word --

                          RICK
               -- Now, just a minute. Who told you
               to ask me that?

                          ANNINA
               He did. Captain Renault did.

                          RICK
               I thought so. Where's your husband?

                          ANNINA
               At the roulette table, trying to
               win enough for our exit visa. Well
               of course, he's losing.

     Rick looks at her closely.

                          RICK
               How long have you been married?

                          ANNINA
               Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria.
               Oh, things are very bad there,
               Monsieur. A devil has the people by
               the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we
               do not want our children to grow up
               in such a country.

                          RICK
                    (wearily)
               So you decided to go to America.

                          ANNINA
               Yes, but we have not much money,
               and travelling is so expensive and
               difficult. It was much more than we
               thought to get here. And then
               Captain Renault sees us and he is
               so kind. He wants to help us.

                          RICK
               Yes, I'll bet.

                          ANNINA
               He tells me he can give us an exit
               visa, but we have no money.

                          RICK
               Does he know that?

                          ANNINA
               Oh, yes.

                          RICK
               And he is still willing to give you
               a visa?

                          ANNINA
               Yes, Monsieur.

                          RICK
               And you want to know --

                          ANNINA
               -- Will he keep his word?

                          RICK
               He always has.

     There is a silence. Annina is very disturbed.

                          ANNINA
               Oh, Monsieur, you are a man. If
               someone loved you very much, so
               that your happiness was the only
               thing that she wanted in the whole
               world, but she did a bad thing to
               make certain of it, could you
               forgive her?

     Rick stares off into space.

                          RICK
               Nobody ever loved me that much.

                          ANNINA
               And he never knew, and the girl
               kept this bad thing locked in her
               heart? That would be all right,
               wouldn't it?

                          RICK
                    (harshly)
               You want my advice?

                          ANNINA
               Oh, yes, please.

                          RICK
               Go back to Bulgaria.

                          ANNINA
               Oh, but if you knew what it means
               to us to leave Europe, to get to
               America! Oh, but if Jan should find
               out! He is such a boy. In many ways
               I am so much older than he is.

                          RICK
               Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca
               has problems. Yours may work out.
               You'll excuse me.

     Rick abruptly rises.

                          ANNINA
                    (tonelessly)
               Thank you, Monsieur.

     He quickly goes off, leaving Annina alone at the table.

     She remains seated, too demoralized to move.

     While Rick checks the reservation list, Ilsa and Laszlo enter
     the cafe.

     In the background we hear Sam playing, ironically enough, "It
     Had to Be You."

     Rick greets Ilsa and Laszlo.

                          RICK
               Good evening.

                          LASZLO
               Good evening. You see, here we are
               again.

                          RICK
               I take that as a great compliment
               to Sam.
                    (to Ilsa)
               I suppose he means to you Paris of,
               well, happier days.

     Laszlo looks around.

                          ILSA
                    (quietly)
               He does. Could we have a table
               close to him?

                          LASZLO
               And as far away from Major Strasser
               as possible.

                          RICK
               Well, the geography may be a little
               difficult to arrange.

     Rick snaps his fingers for the headwaiter.

                          RICK (CONT’D)
               Paul! Table thirty!

                          HEADWAITER
                    (to Ilsa and Laszlo)
               Yes, sir. Right this way, if you
               please.

                          RICK
                    (to Ilsa)
               I'll have Sam play "As Time Goes
               By." I believe that's your favorite
               tune.

                          ILSA
                    (smiling)
               Thank you.

     Rick walks over to Sam and whispers something to him. Sam
     stops what he is playing and begins "As Time Goes By."

     He shakes his head as Rick leaves.

     A waiter appears at Ilsa and Laszlo's table.

                          LASZLO
               Two cognacs, please.

                                                        CUT TO:


     INT. RICK'S CAFE - GAMBLING ROOM - NIGHT

     Jan sits at the roulette table. He has only three chips left
     and seems bewildered.

     As Rick comes up the croupier speaks to Jan.

                          CROUPIER
               Do you wish to place another bet,
               sir?

                          JAN
               No, no, I guess not.

     Rick stands behind Jan.

                          RICK
                    (to Jan)
               Have you tried twenty-two tonight?
               I said, twenty-two.

     Jan looks at Rick, then at the chips in his hand.

     He paues, then puts the chips on twenty-two.

     Rick and the croupier exchange looks. The croupier
     understands what Rick wants him to do. He spins the wheel.

     Carl follows the proceedings, fascinated.

     The wheel stops spinning.

                          CROUPIER
                    (in French)
               Twenty-two, black, twenty-two.

     A winner. Renault, at a nearby table, takes notice of what is
     happening.

     The croupier pushes a pile of chips onto twenty-two and Jan
     reaches for it.

                          RICK
                    (not even looking at Jan)
               Leave it there.

     Jan hesitates, then withdraws his hands.

     Carl continues to watch.

     The wheel spins. Nobody speaks while it spins. It stops.

                          CROUPIER
               Twenty-two, black.

     Another winner. The croupier shoves a pile of chips toward
     Jan.

                          RICK
                    (to Jan)
               Cash it in and don't come back.

     Jan rises to go to the cashier.

     A CUSTOMER complains to Carl.

                          CUSTOMER
               Say, are you sure this place is
               honest?

                          CARL
                    (fervently)
               Honest! As honest as the day is
               long!

     Meanwhile, Rick has walked over to the croupier.

                          RICK
               How we doing tonight?

                          CROUPIER
               Well, a couple of thousand less
               than I thought there would be.

     Rick smiles slightly and goes toward the door.

     Annina runs up to him and hugs him.

                          ANNINA
               Monsieur Rick, I --

                          RICK
               -- He's just a lucky guy.

                          CARL
                    (solicitously)
               Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup
               of coffee?

                          RICK
               No thanks, Carl.

                          CARL
               Monsieur Rick!

     Renault, seeing that Jan has won, gets up from his table to
     follow Rick. Jan and Annina stop him on the way.

                          JAN
               Captain Renault, may I --

                          RENAULT
               -- Oh, not here, please. Come to my
               office in the morning. We'll do
               everything business-like.

                          JAN
               We'll be there at six.

                          RENAULT
               I'll be there at ten. I am very
               happy for both of you. Still, it's
               very strange that you won.

     He looks over and sees Rick.

                          RENAULT (CONT’D)
               Well, maybe not so strange. I'll
               see you in the morning.

                          ANNINA
               Thank you so much, Captain Renault.

                                                        CUT TO:


     INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

     At the bar, Carl whispers in Sacha's ear. Sacha says "No!"

     and runs to Rick.

                          SACHA
               Boss, you've done a beautiful
               thing.

     He kisses Rick on both cheeks.

                          RICK
               Go away, you crazy Russian!

     Carl pours a brandy for Rick.

     Pretending not to do so, Rick glances in Ilsa's direction.

     Renault comes up to him.

                          RENAULT
               As I suspected, you're a rank
               sentimentalist.

                          RICK
               Yeah? Why?

                          RENAULT
                    (chidingly)
               Why do you interfere with my little
               romances?

                          RICK
               Put it down as a gesture to love.

                          RENAULT
                    (good-naturedly)
               Well, I forgive you this time. But
               I'll be in tomorrow night with a
               breathtaking blonde, and it will
               make me very happy if she loses. Uh
               huh!

     He smiles and walks away. Laszlo comes up to Rick.

                          LASZLO
               Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I
               could talk to you?

                          RICK
               Go ahead.

                          LASZLO
               Well, isn't there some other place?
               It's rather confidential, what I
               have to say.

                          RICK
               My office.

                          LASZLO
               Right.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


     INT. RICK'S CAFE - OFFICE - NIGHT

     Rick and Laszlo sit and discuss Laszlo's dilemma.

                          LASZLO
               You must know it's very important I
               get out of Casablanca. It's my
               privilege to be one of the leaders
               of a great movement. You know what
               I have been doing. You know what it
               means to the work, to the lives of
               thousands and thousands of people
               that I be free to reach America and
               continue my work.

                          RICK
               I'm not interested in politics. The
               problems of the world are not in my
               department. I'm a saloon keeper.

                          LASZLO
               My friends in the underground tell
               me that you have quite a record.
               You ran guns to Ethiopia. You
               fought against the fascists in
               Spain.

                          RICK
               What of it?

                          LASZLO
               Isn't it strange that you always
               happened to be fighting on the side
               of the underdog?

                          RICK
               Yes. I found that a very expensive
               hobby, too. But then I never was
               much of a businessman.

     Rick gets up, as does Laszlo.

                          LASZLO
               Are you enough of a businessman to
               appreciate an offer of a hundred
               thousand francs?

                          RICK
               I appreciate it, but I don't accept
               it.

                          LASZLO
               I'll raise it to two hundred
               thousand.

                          RICK
               My friend, you could make it a
               million francs, or three, my answer
               would still be the same.

                          LASZLO
               There must be some reason why you
               won't let me have them.

                          RICK
               There is. I suggest that you ask
               your wife.

                          LASZLO
               I beg your pardon?

                          RICK
               I said, ask your wife.

                          LASZLO
               My wife?

     Laszlo looks at him, puzzled.

                          RICK
               Yes.

     Rick and Laszlo hear MALE VOICES singing downstairs.

                                                        CUT TO:


     INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

     A group of German officers stand around the piano singing the
     "Wacht am Rhein."

                                                        CUT TO:


     INT. RICK'S CAFE - BALCONY - NIGHT

     Rick stands at the balcony outside his office and watches the
     Germans below.

                                                        CUT TO:


     INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

     At the bar, Renault watches with raised eyebrow.

                                                        CUT TO:


     INT. RICK'S CAFE - BALCONY - NIGHT

     Laszlo's lips are very tight as he listens to the song.

     He starts down the step.

                                                        CUT TO:


     INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

     Laszlo passes the table where Ilsa sits and goes straight to
     the orchestra.

     Yvonne, sitting at a table with her German officer, stares
     down into her drink.

     Laszlo speaks to the orchestra.

                          LASZLO
               Play the Marseillaise! Play it!

     Members of the orchestra glance toward the steps, toward
     Rick, who nods to them.

     Laszlo and Corina sing as they start to play. Strasser
     conducts the German singing in an attempt to drown out the
     competition.

     People in the cafe begin to sing the "Marseillaise."

     After a while, Strasser and his officers give up and sit
     down. The "Marseillaise" continues, however.

     Yvonne jumps up and sings with tears in her eyes.

     Ilsa, overcome with emotion, looks proudly at Laszlo, who
     sings with passion.

     Finally the whole cafe stands, singing, their faces aglow.
     The song finishes on a high, triumphant note.

     Yvonne's face is exalted. She deliberately faces the alcove
     where the Germans are watching. She SHOUTS at the top of her
     lungs.

                          YVONNE
               Vive La France! Vive la democracie!

                          CROWD
               Vive La France! Vive la democracie!

     People clap and cheer.

     Strasser is very angry. He strides across the floor toward
     Renault who is standing at the bar.

                          STRASSER
               You see what I mean? If Laszlo's
               presence in a cafe can inspire this
               unfortunate demonstration, what
               more will his presence in
               Casablanca bring on? I advise that
               this place be shut up at once.

                          RENAULT
                    (innocently)
               But everybody's having such a good
               time.

                          STRASSER
               Yes, much too good a time. The
               place is to be closed.

                          RENAULT
               But I have no excuse to close it.

                          STRASSER
                    (snapping)
               Find one.

     Several French officers surround Laszlo, offering him a
     drink.

     Renault thinks a moment, then blows a loud BLAST on his
     whistle. The room grows quiet, all eyes turn toward Renault.

                          RENAULT
                    (loudly)
               Everybody is to leave here
               immediately! This cafe is closed
               until further notice! Clear the
               room at once!

     An angry murmur starts among the crowd. People get up and
     begin to leave.

     Rick comes quickly up to Renault.

                          RICK
               How can you close me up? On what
               grounds?

                          RENAULT
               I am shocked, shocked to find that
               gambling is going on in here!

     This display of nerve leaves Rick at a loss. The croupier
     comes out of the gambling room and up to Renault. He hands
     him a roll of bills.

                          CROUPIER
               Your winnings, sir.

                          RENAULT
               Oh. Thank you very much.

     He turns to the crowd again.

                          RENAULT (CONT’D)
               Everybody out at once!

     As the cafe empties, Strasser approaches Ilsa. His manner is
     abrupt but cordial.

                          STRASSER
               Mademoiselle, after this
               disturbance it is not safe for
               Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.

                          ILSA
               This morning you implied it was not
               safe for him to leave Casablanca.

                          STRASSER
               That is also true, except for one
               destination, to return to occupied
               France.

                          ILSA
               Occupied France?

                          STRASSER
               Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from
               me.

                          ILSA
                    (with intensity)
               What value is that? You may recall
               what German guarantees have been
               worth in the past.

                          STRASSER
               There are only two other
               alternatives for him.

                          ILSA
               What are they?

                          STRASSER
               It is possible the French
               authorities will find a reason to
               put him in the concentration camp
               here.

                          ILSA
               And the other alternative?

                          STRASSER
               My dear Mademoiselle, perhaps you
               have already observed that in
               Casablanca, human life is cheap.
               Good night, Mademoiselle.

     She looks at him, understanding what he means.

     He bows and exits as Laszlo arrives at the table.

     They start out of the cafe.

                          ILSA
               What happened with Rick?

                          LASZLO
               We'll discuss it later.

                                                        CUT TO:


     INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Ilsa and Laszlo walk to their room.

                                                        CUT TO:


     INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

     Laszlo switches on the light as they enter. While Ilsa takes
     off some jewelry he walks to the window and peers out into
     the darkeness. Below and across the street, a man stands
     under an arch. Laszlo watches him, then draws down the shade.

                          LASZLO
               Our faithful friend is still there.

                          ILSA
               Victor, please, don't go to the
               underground meeting tonight.

                          LASZLO
                    (soberly)
               I must. Besides, it isn't often
               that a man has a chance to display
               heroics before his wife.

     He crosses to a table, takes a cigarette from a box, and
     strikes a match.

                          ILSA
               Don't joke. After Major Strasser's
               warning tonight, I am frightened.

                          LASZLO
               To tell you the truth, I am
               frightened too. Shall I remain here
               in our hotel room hiding, or shall
               I carry on the best I can?

     He lights the cigarette.

                          ILSA
               Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on.
               Victor, why don't you tell me about
               Rick? What did you find out?

                          LASZLO
               Apparently he has the letters.

                          ILSA
               Yes?

                          LASZLO
               But no intention of selling them.
               One would think if sentiment
               wouldn't persuade him, money would.

     Ilsa is now noticeably uncomfortable.

                          ILSA
               Did he give any reason?

                          LASZLO
               He suggested I ask you.

                          ILSA
               Ask me?

                          LASZLO
               Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I
               don't know why he said that.

     Laszlo turns off the light. Ilsa walks over to the couch and
     sits down.

                          LASZLO (CONT’D)
               Well, our friend outside will think
               we've retired by now. I'll be going
               in a few minutes.

     He sits down on the couch next to her. A silence falls
     between them. It grows strained. Finally...

                          LASZLO (CONT’D)
               Ilsa, I --

                          ILSA
               -- Yes?

                          LASZLO
               When I was in the concentration
               camp, were you lonely in Paris?

     Ilsa still cannot look at him.

                          ILSA
               Yes, Victor, I was.

                          LASZLO
                    (sympathetically)
               I know how it is to be lonely.
                    (very quietly)
               Is there anything you wish to tell
               me?

                          ILSA
                    (speaking low)
               No, Victor, there isn't.

                          LASZLO
               I love you very much, my dear.

     Ilsa finally turns to look at Laszlo.

                          ILSA
               Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I
               do, will you believe that I, that -
               -

                          LASZLO
               -- You don't even have to say it.
               I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.

     He bends down and kisses her cheek.

                          ILSA
               Goodnight.

     She watches him go.

                          ILSA (CONT’D)
               Victor!

     She gets up and follows him to the door. He opens it. In the
     slit of light from the hall we see Ilsa's face, now strained
     and worried. She hesitates for a moment, then...

                          ILSA (CONT’D)
               Be careful.

                          LASZLO
               Of course, I'll be careful.

     He kisses her on the cheek and goes out the door. She stands
     there for a few seconds, then crosses to look out of the
     window.

     The figure in the archway is gone. She sees Victor walking
     down the street and closes the blind again. Ilsa gets a cloak
     from the bedroom, and leaves the hotel room.

                                                        CUT TO:


     INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

     Rick and Carl sit by the bar and look over ledgers. Carl is
     busy figuring. He looks up at Rick.

                          CARL
               Well, you are in pretty good shape,
               Herr Rick.

                          RICK
               How long can I afford to stay
               closed?

                          CARL
               Oh, two weeks, maybe three.

                          RICK
               Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has
               worked before. In the meantime,
               everybody stays on salary.

                          CARL
               Oh, thank you, Herr Rick. Sacha
               will be happy to hear it. I owe him
               money.

     Carl laughs.

                          RICK
               Now you finish locking up, will
               you, Carl?

                          CARL
               I will. Then I am going to the
               meeting of the --

                          RICK
                    (interrupting)
               -- Don't tell me where you're
               going.

                          CARL
               I won't.

                          RICK
               Goodnight.

                          CARL
               Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.

     Rick walks up the stairs to his apartment.

                                                        CUT TO:


     INT. RICK'S CAFE - APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Rick opens the door and goes inside the dark room. Light from
     the hall reveals a figure by the window. He lights a small
     lamp. Ilsa faces him, her face white but determined.

     Rick pauses for a moment in astonishment.

                          RICK
               How did you get in?

                          ILSA
               The stairs from the street.

     Ilsa comes over to meet him.

                          RICK
               I told you this morning you'd come
               around, but this is a little ahead
               of schedule. Well, won't you sit
               down?

                          ILSA
               Richard, I had to see you.

                          RICK
               You use "Richard" again? We're back
               in Paris.

                          ILSA
               Please.

                          RICK
               Your unexpected visit isn't
               connected by any chance with the
               letters of transit? It seems that
               as long as I have those letters
               I'll never be lonely.

                          ILSA
               You can ask any price you want, but
               you must give me those letters.

                          RICK
               I went through all that with your
               husband. It's no deal.

                          ILSA
               I know how you feel about me, but
               I'm asking you to put your feelings
               aside for something more important.

                          RICK
               Do I have to hear again what a
               great man your husband is? What an
               important cause he's fighting for?

                          ILSA
               It was your cause, too. In your own
               way, you were fighting for the same
               thing.

                          RICK
               I'm not fighting for anything
               anymore, except myself. I'm the
               only cause I'm interested in.

     He walks over to the window and Ilsa follows.

                          ILSA
               Richard, Richard, we loved each
               other once. If those days meant
               anything at all to you --

                          RICK
                    (interrupting, harshly)
               -- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I
               were you. It's poor salesmanship.

                          ILSA
               Please. Please listen to me. If you
               knew what really happened, if you
               only knew the truth --

                          RICK
                    (cutting in)
               -- I wouldn't believe you, no
               matter what you told me. You'd say
               anything now to get what you want.

     Rick walks over to a table and opens a cigarette box, but
     finds it empty.

                          ILSA
               You want to feel sorry for
               yourself, don't you? With so much
               at stake, all you can think of is
               your own feelings. One woman has
               hurt you, and you take revenge on
               the rest of the world. You're a,
               you're a coward, and a weakling.

     There are tears in her eyes now.

                          ILSA (CONT’D)
               No. Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. I'm
               sorry, but, but you, you are our
               last hope. If you don't help us,
               Victor Laszlo will die in
               Casablanca.

                          RICK
               What of it? I'm going to die in
               Casablanca. It's a good spot for
               it.

     He turns away to light a cigarette, then back to Ilsa.

                          RICK (CONT’D)
               Now if you --

     He stops short as he sees Ilsa holding a small revolver in
     her hand. It's pointed directly at him.

                          ILSA
               -- All right. I tried to reason
               with you. I tried everything. Now I
               want those letters. Get them for
               me.

                          RICK
               I don't have to. I've got them
               right here.

                          ILSA
               Put them on the table.

                          RICK
                    (shaking his head)
               No.

                          ILSA
               For the last time, put them on the
               table.

                          RICK
               If Laszlo and the cause mean so
               much to you, you won't stop at
               anything. All right, I'll make it
               easier for you.

     He moves closer to her.

                          RICK (CONT’D)
               Go ahead and shoot. You'll be doing
               me a favor.

     Her hand drops down, and there are tears in her eyes again.

     She turns and walks away from him.

                          ILSA
               Richard, I tried to stay away. I
               thought I would never see you
               again, that you were out of my
               life.

     Rick follows her and takes her in his arms. He presses her
     tight to him.

                          ILSA (CONT’D)
               The day you left, if you knew what
               I went through! If you knew how
               much I loved you, how much I still
               love you!

     Rick kisses her passionately. She is lost in his embrace.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


     INT. RICK'S CAFE - APARTMENT - LATER

     From his window, Rick watches the revolving beacon light at
     the airport.

     Ilsa sits on the couch. On a table before her rests a bottle
     of champagne along with two half-filled glasses.

     Rick walks over to her.

                          RICK
               And then?

                          ILSA
               It wasn't long after we were
               married that Victor went back to
               Czechoslovakia. They needed him in
               Prague, but there the Gestapo were
               waiting for him. Just a two-line
               item in the paper: "Victor Laszlo
               apprehended. Sent to concen-tration
               camp." I was frantic. For months I
               tried to get word. Then it came. He
               was dead, shot trying to escape. I
               was lonely. I had nothing. Not even
               hope. Then I met you.

                          RICK
               Why weren't you honest with me? Why
               did you keep your marriage a
               secret?

     Rick sits down with Ilsa.

                          ILSA
               Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard.
               Victor wanted it that way. Not even
               our closest friends knew about our
               marriage. That was his way of
               protecting me. I knew so much about
               his work, and if the Gestapo found
               out I was his wife it would be
               dangerous for me and for those
               working with me.

                          RICK
               When did you first find out he was
               alive?

                          ILSA
               Just before you and I were to leave
               Paris together. A friend came and
               told me that Victor was alive. They
               were hiding him in a freight car on
               the outskirts of Paris. He was
               sick, he needed me. I wanted to
               tell you, but I, I didn't care. I
               knew, I knew you wouldn't have left
               Paris, and the Gestapo would have
               caught you. So I... well, well, you
               know the rest.

                          RICK
               Huh. But it's still a story without
               an ending. What about now?

                          ILSA
               Now? I don't know. I know that I'll
               never have the strength to leave
               you again.

                          RICK
               And Laszlo?

                          ILSA
               Oh, you'll help him now, Richard,
               won't you? You'll see that he gets
               out? Then he'll have his work, all
               that he's been living for.

                          RICK
               All except one. He won't have you.

     Ilsa puts her head on Rick's shoulder.

                          ILSA
               I can't fight it anymore. I ran
               away from you once. I can't do it
               again. Oh, I don't know what's
               right any longer. You'll have to
               think for both of us, for all of
               us.

                          RICK
               All right, I will. Here's looking
               at you, kid.

                          ILSA
               I wish I didn't love you so much.

     She snuggles closer to Rick.

                                                        CUT TO:


     EXT. RICK'S CAFE - NIGHT

     Laszlo and Carl make their way through the darkness toward a
     side entance of Rick's. They run inside the entryway.

     The headlights of a speeding police car sweep toward them.

     They flatten themselves against a wall to avoid detection.

     The lights move past them.

                          CARL
               I think we lost them.

                          LASZLO
               Yes. I'm afraid they caught some of
               the others.

                          CARL
               Come inside. Come.

                                                        CUT TO:


     INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

     Laszlo and Carl enter and cross toward the bar, out of breath
     from their exertion.

                          CARL
               Come inside. I will help you. Come
               in here.

                          LASZLO
               Thank you.

     Carl goes behind the bar.

                          CARL
               I will give you some water.

                                                        CUT TO:


     INT./EXT. RICK'S CAFE - APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Rick and Ilsa hear voices below. Rick crosses to the door.

     He opens it just enough to see below, and turns off the
     light.

     Ilsa stands just in back of him. She makes a move as if to go
     out to the balcony but Rick's pushes her back. She withdraws
     behind the door.

     Rick walks out to the balcony railing.


     INT. RICK'S CAFE - BALCONY/MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

     Rick sees Carl attending to Laszlo, who appears to be
     injured.

                          RICK
               Carl, what happened?

     Both Carl and Laszlo look up.

                          CARL
                    (excitedly)
               The police break up our meeting.
               Herr Rick! We escaped in the last
               moment.

                          RICK
               Come up here a minute.

     Carl looks up wonderingly, then starts toward the stairway.

                          CARL
               Yes, I come.

                          RICK
               I want you to turn out the light in
               the rear entrance. It might attract
               the police.

                          CARL
               But Sacha always puts out that
               light --

                          RICK
               -- Tonight he forgot.

                          CARL
               Yes, I come, I will do it.

     Carl climbs the stairs.

                                                        CUT TO:


     INT. RICK'S CAFE - APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Carl enters Rick's apartment and sees Ilsa. He looks at Rick
     and says nothing.

                          RICK
                    (in a low voice)
               I want you to take Miss Lund home.

                          CARL
               Yes, sir.

                                                        CUT TO:


     INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

     Rick comes down the stairs. Laszlo wraps one of the small bar
     towels around his cut wrist. Rick looks questioningly at the
     injured hand.

                          LASZLO
               It's nothing. Just a little cut. We
               had to get through a window.

     Rick walks to the bar, picks up a bottle, and pours a drink.

                          RICK
               Well, this might come in handy.

                          LASZLO
               Thank you.

                          RICK
               Had a close one, eh?

                          LASZLO
               Yes, rather.

     Laszlo takes a drink.

                          RICK
               Don't you sometimes wonder if it's
               worth all this? I mean what you're
               fighting for?

                          LASZLO
               We might as well question why we
               breathe. If we stop breathing,
               we'll die. If we stop fighting our
               enemies, the world will die.

                          RICK
               What of it? Then it'll be out of
               it's misery.

     Rick reaches in his jacket for his cigarette case, opens it,
     and takes out a cigarette.

                          LASZLO
               You know how you sound, Monsieur
               Blaine? Like a man who's trying to
               convince himself of something he
               doesn't believe in his heart. Each
               of us has a destiny, for good or
               for evil.

                          RICK
               Yes, I get the point.

     Rick lights his cigarette.

                          LASZLO
               I wonder if you do. I wonder if you
               know that you're trying to escape
               from yourself and that you'll never
               succeed.

                          RICK
               You seem to know all about my
               destiny.

                          LASZLO
               I know a good deal more about you
               than you suspect. I know, for
               instance, that you are in love with
               a woman. It is perhaps strange that
               we both should be in love with the
               same woman. The first evening I
               came here in this cafe, I knew
               there was something between you and
               Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I,
               I demand no explanation. I ask only
               one thing. You won't give me the
               letters of transit. All right. But
               I want my wife to be safe. I ask
               you as a favor to use the letters
               to take her away from Casablanca.

                          RICK
               You love her that much?

                          LASZLO
               Apparently you think of me only as
               the leader of a cause. Well, I am
               also a human being.

     He looks away for a moment.

                          LASZLO (CONT’D)
               Yes, I love her that much.

     Suddenly there is a CRASH at the door of the cafe, followed
     by the forced entry of several gendarmes. A French officer
     walks in and addresses Laszlo.

                          FRENCH OFFICER
               Mr. Laszlo?

                          LASZLO
               Yes?

                          FRENCH OFFICER
               You will come with us. We have a
               warrant for your arrest.

                          LASZLO
               On what charge?

                          FRENCH OFFICER
               Captain Renault will discuss that
               with you later.

                          RICK
               It seems that destiny has taken a
               hand.

     Laszlo looks for a moment at Rick, then in dignified silence
     crosses to the officer. Together they walk toward the door.

     Rick's eyes follow them, but his expression reveals nothing
     of his feelings.

                                                        CUT TO:


     INT. RENAULT'S OFFICE - MORNING

     Renault sits at his desk and smokes while Rick nervously
     fingers his hat. They're interrupted by an orderly.

     Renault hands some forms to the orderly, who then exits, and
     the conversation continues.

                          RICK
               But you haven't any actual proof,
               and you know it. This isn't Germany
               or occupied France. All you can do
               is fine him a few thousand francs
               and give him thirty days. You might
               as well let him go now.

                          RENAULT
               Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too
               interested in what happens to
               Laszlo. If by any chance you were
               to help him escape --

                          RICK
               -- What makes you think I'd stick
               my neck out for Laszlo?

                          RENAULT
               Because one, you've bet ten
               thousand francs he'd escape. Two,
               you have the letters of transit,
               now don't bother to deny it. And,
               well, you might do it simply
               because you don't like Strasser's
               looks. As a matter of fact, I don't
               like him either.

                          RICK
               Well, they're all excellent
               reasons.

                          RENAULT
               Don't count too much on my
               friendship, Ricky. In this matter
               I'm powerless. Besides, I might
               lose ten thousand francs.

                          RICK
               You're not very subtle, but you are
               effective. I, I get the point. Yes,
               I have the letters, but I intend
               using them myself. I'm leaving
               Casablanca on tonight's plane, the
               last plane.

                          RENAULT
               Huh?

                          RICK
               And I'm taking a friend with me.
               One you'll appreciate.

                          RENAULT
               What friend?

                          RICK
               Ilsa Lund.
                    (pause)
               That ought to put your mind to rest
               about my helping Laszlo escape. The
               last man I want to see in America.

                          RENAULT
               You didn't come here to tell me
               this. You have the letters of
               transit. You can fill in your name
               and hers and leave any time you
               please. Why are you interested in
               what happens to Laszlo?

     Renault gets out of his chair and crosses to the front of his
     desk.

                          RICK
               I'm not. But I am interested in
               what happens to Ilsa and me. We
               have a legal right to go, that's
               true. But people have been held in
               Casablanca in spite of their legal
               rights.

     Renault retrieves a fresh cigarette from a box on his desk.

                          RENAULT
               What makes you think we want to
               hold you?

     Renault chain-lights his new cigarette with the old one.

                          RICK
               Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably
               knows things that Strasser would
               like to know. Louis, I'll make a
               deal with you. Instead of this
               petty charge you have against him,
               you can get something really big,
               something that would chuck him in a
               concentration camp for years. That
               would be quite a feather in your
               cap, wouldn't it?

                          RENAULT
               It certainly would. Germany...
               Vichy would be very grateful.

                          RICK
               Then release him. You be at my
               place a half hour before the plane
               leaves.

     Renault sits back down in his chair.

                          RICK (CONT’D)
               I'll arrange to have Laszlo come
               there to pick up the letters of
               transit, and that'll give you the
               criminal grounds on which to make
               the arrest. You get him, and we get
               away. To the Germans that last will
               be just a minor annoyance.

                          RENAULT
                    (puzzled)
               There's still something about this
               business I don't quite understand.
               Miss Lund, she's very beautiful,
               yes, but you were never interested
               in any woman.

                          RICK
               Well, she isn't just any woman.

     Rick stares at the floor, then looks back up at Renault.

                          RENAULT
               I see. How do I know you'll keep
               your end of the bargain?

                          RICK
               I'll make the arrangements right
               now with Laszlo in the visitor's
               pen.

                          RENAULT
               Ricky, I'm going to miss you.
               Apparently you're the only one in
               Casablanca who has even less
               scruples than I.

                          RICK
               Oh, thanks.

                          RENAULT
               Go ahead, Ricky.

     Renault presses a button on his desk, triggering a BUZZER.

     The door to Renault's office opens. Rick rises to go.

                          RICK
               And by the way, call off your
               watchdogs when you let him go. I
               don't want them around this
               afternoon. I'm taking no chances,
               Louis, not even with you.

                                                        CUT TO:


     INT. THE BLUE PARROT - DAY

     A waiter brings tea to Rick and Ferrari, who sit alone at a
     table in a secluded nook off the main room.

                          FERRARI
               Shall we draw up the papers, or is
               our handshake good enough?

                          RICK
               It's certainly not good enough. But
               since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to
               do.

     Ferrari pours a cup for Rick, who takes a sip.

                          FERRARI
               Ah, to get out of Casablanca and go
               to America! You're a lucky man.

                          RICK
               Oh, by the way, my agreement with
               Sam's always been that he gets
               twenty-five percent of the profits.
               That still goes.

                          FERRARI
               Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets
               ten percent. But he's worth twenty-
               five.

                          RICK
               And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they
               stay with the place, or I don't
               sell.

                          FERRARI
               Of course they stay. Rick's
               wouldn't be Rick's without them.

                          RICK
               Well, so long.

     Rick gets up, followed by Ferrari. They shake hands to seal

     the deal.

     He walks to the door, then stops and turns around.

                          RICK (CONT’D)
               Don't forget, you owe Rick's a
               hundred cartons of American
               cigarettes.

                          FERRARI
               I shall remember to pay it... to
               myself.

     Rick leaves. Ferrari picks up a fly swatter from the table
     and swats at a fly.

                                                        CUT TO:


     EXT. RICK'S CAFE - NIGHT

     A car pulls quickly to a stop just outside the cafe.

     On the door a huge placard reads:

                          CLOSED
               By Order of the Prefect of Police

                                                        CUT TO:


     INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

     Rick sits at a table inside and reads the letters of transit.

     He hears a KNOCK on the door and puts them away in his
     pocket.

     He opens the door and Renault walks in.

                          RICK
               You're late.

                          RENAULT
               I was informed just as Laszlo was
               about to leave the hotel, so I knew
               I'd be on time.

                          RICK
               I thought I asked you to tie up
               your watchdogs.

                          RENAULT
               Oh, he won't be followed here.

     Renault looks around the empty cafe.

                          RENAULT (CONT’D)
               You know, this place will never be
               the same without you, Ricky.

                          RICK
               Yes, I know what you mean, but I've
               already spoken to Ferrari. You'll
               still win at roulette.

                          RENAULT
               Is everything ready?

     Rick points at his breast pocket.

                          RICK
               I have the letters right here.

                          RENAULT
               Tell me, when we searched the
               place, where were they?

                          RICK
               Sam's piano.

                          RENAULT
               Serves me right for not being
               musical.

     They hear the CRUNCH of tires as a car pull up.

                          RICK
               Oh. Here they are. You'd better
               wait in my office.

     Renault walks up the stairs to Rick's office.

                                                        CUT TO:


     EXT. RICK'S CAFE - NIGHT

     Laszlo pays the cab driver. Ilsa quickly walks toward the
     entrance.

                          LASZLO
                    (to driver)
               Here.

                                                        CUT TO:


     INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

     Rick opens the door. Ilsa rushes in. Her intensity reveals
     the strain she is under. Rick grabs her by both arms and
     pulls her close.

                          ILSA
               Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving
               with him. Haven't you told him?

                          RICK
               No, not yet.

                          ILSA
               But it's all right, isn't it? You
               were able to arrange everything?

                          RICK
               Everything is quite all right.

                          ILSA
               Oh, Rick!

     She looks at him with a vaguely questioning look.

                          RICK
               We'll tell him at the airport. The
               less time to think, the easier for
               all of us. Please trust me.

     Ilsa pauses and looks at Rick, unsure for a moment.

                          ILSA
               Yes, I will.

     Laszlo comes in and closes the door behind himself.

                          LASZLO
               Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how
               to thank you.

                          RICK
               Oh, save it. We've still lots of
               things to do.

     They all walk towards the bar. Laszlo deposits his hat on a a
     nearby table.

     INT. RICK'S CAFE - OFFICE - NIGHT

     Renault opens the office door and peers down at the
     proceedings.

     INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

                          LASZLO
               I brought the money, Monsieur
               Blaine.

                          RICK
               Keep it. You'll need it in America.

                          LASZLO
               But we made a deal.

                          RICK
                    (cutting him short)
               Oh, never mind about that. You
               won't have any trouble in Lisbon,
               will you?

                          LASZLO
               No. It's all arranged.

                          RICK
               Good. I've got the letters right
               here, all made out in blank.

     He takes out the letters.

                          RICK (CONT’D)
               All you have to do is fill in the
               signatures.

     He hands them to Laszlo, who takes them gratefully.

                          RENAULT
               Victor Laszlo!

     All three hear footsteps and turn to see Renault walking
     towards them from the bottom of the stairs.

                          RENAULT (CONT’D)
               Victor Laszlo, you are under
               arrest...
                    (as he walks toward them)
               on a charge of accessory to the
               murder of the couriers from whom
               these letters were stolen.

     Ilsa and Laszlo are both caught completely off guard. They
     turn towards Rick, bewildered. Horror is in Ilsa's eyes.

     Renault takes the letters.

                          RENAULT (CONT’D)
               Oh, you are surprised about my
               friend Ricky?

     Obviously the situation delights Renault. He smiles as he
     turns toward Rick.

                          RENAULT (CONT’D)
               The explanation is quite simple.
               Love, it seems, has triumphed over
               virtue. Thank --

     Suddenly the smile fades. In Rick's hand is a gun, which he
     levels at Renault.

                          RICK
               -- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's
               going to be arrested. Not for a
               while yet.

                          RENAULT
               Have you taken leave of your
               senses?

                          RICK
               I have. Sit down over there.

                          RENAULT
               Put that gun down.

     Renault then walks toward Rick. Rick puts out his arm to stop
     him.

                          RICK
               Louis, I wouldn't like to shoot
               you, but I will, if you take one
               more step.

     Renault halts for a moment and studies Rick.

                          RENAULT
               Under the circumstances, I will sit
               down.

     He walks to a table and sits.

                          RICK
                    (sharply)
               Keep your hands on the table.

     He takes out a cigarette case.

                          RENAULT
               I suppose you know what you're
               doing, but I wonder if you realize
               what this means?

                          RICK
               I do. We've got plenty of time to
               discuss that later.

                          RENAULT
               Call off your watch-dogs you said.

                          RICK
               Just the same, you call the airport
               and let me hear you tell them. And
               remember, this gun's pointed right
               at your heart.

                          RENAULT
               That is my least vulnerable spot.

     As Renault picks up the phone and dials, Rick takes back the
     letters.

                          RENAULT (CONT’D)
                    (into phone)
               Hello, is this the airport? This is
               Captain Renault speaking. There'll
               be two letters of transit for the
               Lisbon plane. There's to be no
               trouble about them. Good.

     INT. GERMAN CONSULATE - NIGHT

     Strasser is on the phone.

                          STRASSER
               Hello? Hello?

     He hangs up the receiver and presses a BUZZER on his desk.

     An officer quickly enters.

                          STRASSER (CONT’D)
                    (to officer)
               My car, quickly!

                          OFFICER
                    (saluting)
               Zu Befehl, Herr Major.

     The officer exits and Strasser resumes on the telephone.

                          STRASSER
               This is Major Strasser. Have a
               squad of police meet me at the
               airport at once. At once! Do you
               hear?

     He hangs up the receiver and, grabbing for his cap, hurriedly
     exits.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


     EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

     The entire airport is surrounded by a heavy fog. The outline
     of the transport plane is barely visible.

     INT./EXT. AIRPORT HANGAR - NIGHT

     A uniformed ORDERLY uses a telephone near the hangar door.

     On the airfield a transport plane is being readied.

                          ORDERLY
               Hello. Hello, radio tower? Lisbon
               plane taking off in ten minutes.
               East runway. Visibility: one and
               one half miles. Light ground fog.
               Depth of fog: approximately 500.
               Ceiling: unlimited. Thank you.

     He hangs up and moves to a car that has just pulled up
     outside the hangar.

     Renault gets out while the orderly stands at attention.

     He's closely followed by Rick, right hand in the pocket of
     his trench coat, covering Renault with a gun.

     Laszlo and Ilsa emerge from the rear of the car.

                          RICK
                    (indicating the orderly)
               Louis, have your man go with Mr.
               Laszlo and take care of his
               luggage.

                          RENAULT
                    (bowing ironically)
               Certainly Rick, anything you say.
                    (to orderly)
               Find Mr. Laszlo's luggage and put
               it it on the plane.

                          ORDERLY
               Yes, sir. This way please.

     The orderly escorts Laszlo off in the direction of the plane.

     Rick takes the letters of transit out of his pocket and hands
     them to Renault, who turns and walks toward the hangar.

                          RICK
               If you don't mind, you fill in the
               names. That will make it even more
               official.

                          RENAULT
               You think of everything, don't you?

                          RICK
                    (quietly)
               And the names are Mr. and Mrs.
               Victor Laszlo.

     Renault stops dead in his tracks, and turns around. Both Ilsa
     and Renault look at Rick with astonishment.

                          ILSA
               But why my name, Richard?

                          RICK
               Because you're getting on that
               plane.

                          ILSA
                    (confused)
               I don't understand. What about you?

                          RICK
               I'm staying here with him 'til the
               plane gets safely away.

     Rick's intention suddenly dawns on Ilsa.

                          ILSA
               No, Richard, no. What has happened
               to you? Last night we said --

                          RICK
               -- Last night we said a great many
               things. You said I was to do the
               thinking for both of us. Well, I've
               done a lot of it since then and it
               all adds up to one thing. You're
               getting on that plane with Victor
               where you belong.

                          ILSA
                    (protesting)
               But Richard, no, I, I --

                          RICK
               -- You've got to listen to me. Do
               you have any idea what you'd have
               to look forward to if you stayed
               here? Nine chances out of ten we'd
               both wind up in a concentration
               camp. Isn't that true, Louis?

     Renault countersigns the papers.

                          RENAULT
               I'm afraid Major Strasser would
               insist.

                          ILSA
               You're saying this only to make me
               go.

                          RICK
               I'm saying it because it's true.
               Inside of us we both know you
               belong with Victor. You're part of
               his work, the thing that keeps him
               going. If that plane leaves the
               ground and you're not with him,
               you'll regret it.

                          ILSA
               No.

                          RICK
               Maybe not today, maybe not
               tomorrow, but soon, and for the
               rest of your life.

                          ILSA
               But what about us?

                          RICK
               We'll always have Paris. We didn't
               have, we'd lost it, until you came
               to Casablanca. We got it back last
               night.

                          ILSA
               And I said I would never leave you.

                          RICK
               And you never will. But I've got a
               job to do, too. Where I'm going you
               can't follow. What I've got to do
               you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm
               no good at being noble, but it
               doesn't take much to see that the
               problems of three little people
               don't amount to a hill of beans in
               this crazy world. Someday you'll
               understand that. Now, now...

     Ilsa's eyes well up with tears. Rick puts his hand to her
     chin and raises her face to meet his own.

                          RICK (CONT’D)
               Here's looking at you, kid.

     INT./EXT. AIRPORT HANGAR - NIGHT

     Laszlo returns. Rick walks into the hangar and Renault hands
     him the letters. He walks back out to Laszlo.

                          LASZLO
               Everything in order?

                          RICK
               All except one thing. There's
               something you should know before
               you leave.

                          LASZLO
                    (sensing what is coming)
               Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to
               explain anything.

                          RICK
               I'm going to anyway, because it may
               make a difference to you later on.
               You said you knew about Ilsa and
               me.

                          LASZLO
               Yes.

                          RICK
               But you didn't know she was at my
               place last night when you were. She
               came there for the letters of
               transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?

                          ILSA
                    (facing Laszlo)
               Yes.

                          RICK
                    (forcefully)
               She tried everything to get them,
               and nothing worked. She did her
               best to convince me that she was
               still in love with me, but that was
               all over long ago. For your sake,
               she pretended it wasn't, and I let
               her pretend.

                          LASZLO
               I understand.

                          RICK
               Here it is.

     Rick hands the letters to Laszlo.

                          LASZLO
               Thanks. I appreciate it.

     Laszlo extends his hand to Rick, who grasps it firmly.

                          LASZLO (CONT’D)
               And welcome back to the fight. This
               time I know our side will win.

     On the airfield the airplane engine TURNS OVER and the
     propellers start turning. They all turn to see the plane
     readying for take-off.

     Ilsa looks at Rick and he returns her stare with a blank
     expression. He then glances at Laszlo, as does Ilsa.

     Then Laszlo breaks the silence.

                          LASZLO (CONT’D)
               Are you ready Ilsa?

                          ILSA
               Yes, I'm ready.
                    (to Rick)
               Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.

                          RICK
               You better hurry, or you'll miss
               that plane.

     Rick watches as Ilsa and Laszlo walk very deliberately
     towards the plane.

                          RENAULT
               Well I was right. You are a
               sentimentalist.

                          RICK
               Stay where you are. I don't know
               what you're talking about.

     Rick puts a cigarette in his mouth.

                          RENAULT
               What you just did for Laszlo, and
               that fairy tale that you invented
               to send Ilsa away with him. I know
               a little about women, my friend.
               She went, but she knew you were
               lying.

                          RICK
               Anyway, thanks for helping me out.

                          RENAULT
               I suppose you know this isn't going
               to be pleasant for either of us,
               especially for you. I'll have to
               arrest you of course.

                          RICK
               As soon as the plane goes, Louis.

     The door to the plane is closed by an attendant and it slowly
     taxies down the field.

     Suddenly a speeding car comes to a stop outside the hangar.

     Strasser alights from the car and runs toward Renault.

                          STRASSER
               What is the meaning of that phone
               call?

                          RENAULT
               Victor Laszlo is on that plane.

     Renault nods toward the field. Strasser turns to see the
     plane taxiing towards the runway.

                          STRASSER
               Why do you stand here? Why don't
               you stop him?

                          RENAULT
               Ask Monsieur Rick.

     Strasser looks briefly at Rick, then makes a step towards the
     telephone just inside the hangar door.

                          RICK
               Get away from that phone.

     Strasser stops in his tracks, looks at Rick, and sees that he
     is armed.

                          STRASSER
                    (steely)
               I would advise you not to
               interfere.

                          RICK
               I was willing to shoot Captain
               Renault, and I'm willing to shoot
               you.

     Strasser watches the plane in agony. His eyes dart towards
     the telephone. He runs toward it and desperately grabs the
     receiver.

                          STRASSER
               Hello?

                          RICK
               Put that phone down!

                          STRASSER
               Get me the Radio Tower!

                          RICK
               Put it down!

     Strasser, one hand holding the receiver, pulls out a pistol
     with the other hand, and SHOOTS quickly at Rick. The bullet
     misses its mark.

     Rick now SHOOTS at Strasser, who crumples to the ground.

     At the sound of an approaching car both men turn. A police
     car SPEEDS in and comes to a stop near Renault. Four
     gendarmes hurriedly jump out.

     In the distance the plane turns onto the runway.

     The gendarmes run to Renault. The first one hurriedly salutes
     him.

                          GENDARME
               Mon Capitaine!

                          RENAULT
               Major Strasser's been shot.

     Renault pauses and looks at Rick. Rick returns Renault's gaze
     with expressionless eyes.

                          RENAULT (CONT’D)
               Round up the usual suspects.

                          GENDARME
               Oui, mon Capitaine.

     The gendarmes take Strasser's body away and then drive off.

     Renault walks inside the hangar, picks up a bottle of Vichy
     water, and opens it.

                          RENAULT
               Well, Rick, you're not only a
               sentimentalist, but you've become a
               patriot.

                          RICK
               Maybe, but it seemed like a good
               time to start.

                          RENAULT
               I think perhaps you're right.

     As he pours the water into a glass, Renault sees the Vichy
     label and quickly DROPS the bottle into a trash basket which
     he then KICKS over.

     He walks over and stands beside Rick. They both watch the
     plane take off, maintaining their gaze until it disappears
     into the clouds.

     Rick and Louis slowly walk away from the hangar toward the
     runway.

                          RENAULT (CONT’D)
               It might be a good idea for you to
               disappear from Casablanca for a
               while. There's a Free French
               garrison over at Brazzaville. I
               could be induced to arrange a
               passage.

                          RICK
               My letter of transit? I could use a
               trip. But it doesn't make any
               difference about our bet. You still
               owe me ten thousand francs.

                          RENAULT
               And that ten thousand francs should
               pay our expenses.

                          RICK
               Our expenses?

                          RENAULT
               Uh huh.

                          RICK
               Louis, I think this is the
               beginning of a beautiful
               friendship.

     The two walk off together into the night.

                                                      FADE OUT.

     THE END
