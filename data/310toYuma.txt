                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     A dark room in a small ranch house.

     A desert wind blows in gusts.

     WILLIAM EVANS (14), lies awake. Not a boy and not a man,
     there’s a restlessness in his eyes. He lights a match,
     watching it blow out in his fingers.

     His brother, MARK (7), lies beside him, his breathing
     labored, asthmatic. A medicine bottle and spoon sit on the
     table beside a folded tearsheet for the ‘Colt Peacemaker’.

     William stares at the engraving of a gunslinger, brandishing
     the fancy weapon, a smile of confidence on his face.

     Suddenly William turns, alert. There is a faint sound.

     ...a gate creak... a latch clink.

                                                        CUT TO:

                          2 IN ANOTHER DARK ROOM-- CONTINUOUS--

     ALICE EVANS, 32, beautiful but care-worn, opens her eyes.

     Groggy, she reaches reflexively for--

     DAN EVANS, 36, her husband. But he isn’t against the pillow
     where her hand expects him. He is upright on the edge of the
     bed, tense, sweaty, eyes on a window as he LOADS HIS PISTOL.

                          ALICE
               Dan...

     He signals silence. Alice holds her breath, listening to the
     air... nothing... The clock on the dresser reads 3:45...

                          ALICE (CONT’D)
               ...maybe it’s the wind...

     Dan shakes his head. He glances to WILLIAM, who arrives in
     the bedroom door, in his longjohns, holding AN OLD RIFLE.

     The snort of a horse outside. Men whisper. Hooves.

     DAN BOLTS FROM THE BED, crossing to the window on one leg,
     using the beamed roof for support. He pushes back the drape
     with his pistol.

             3 A HORSEMAN ENCIRCLES THE BARN OF THIS HOMESTEAD,
                                                    UNHOOKING A


     CORRAL, LETTING LOOSE A HERD OF CATTLE.

     Then Dan notices--

     ANOTHER HORSEMAN at the corner of the barn, LIGHTING A FIRE.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          DAN
               No!--


     EXT. EVANS RANCH-- CONTINUOUS

     Wearing longjohns and boots, DAN BUSTS OUT THE DOOR, moving
     toward the man fanning fire at the barn--

                          DAN
               No-- Please-- stop!--

     A RIFLE BUTT SMASHES DAN’S HEAD. He tumbles off the porch to
     the dirt, losing his gun, one boot coming off, revealing--


     A MISSING LEFT FOOT.

     William runs past Alice and Mark on the porch and his father
     on the ground as--

     THE BARN EXPLODES IN FLAMES. Dan jerks back on his rigged
     boot, gets upright and lunges toward the barn.

     THE FIRST HORSEMAN, bears down on him.

                          HORSEMAN (TUCKER)
               -- You have a week, Evans. Then we
               burn the house.


     THE HORSEMEN RIDE AWAY AS WILLIAM ENTERS THE FLAMING BARN.

                          DAN
               William!


     INT./EXT. BARN-- CONTINUOUS--


     FLAMES LICK THE RAFTERS. SMOKE.

     FOUR HORSES tied in stalls, crazy with fear.

     William frees two of them, Dan untangles the others and leads
     them out, grabbing equipment, tossing saddles out the door...

     Then Dan notices WILLIAM HAS TURNED BACK INSIDE.

     William struggles to drag A HUGE SACK OF FEED and some tools-
     -

     We see above him, the burning roof sags, flaming pieces of
     wood raining-- it’s about to collapse--

     DAN LEAPS AND GRABS HIS BOY and drags him toward the door,
     fists swinging.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          WILLIAM
               --Let go! It’s the last we got!

     They fall to the ground as THE BARN COLLAPSES in a fiery
     mass, sparks showering down. Alice and Mark run toward them.

                          DAN
               ...You alright?

     Will turns from his father to see- THE TWO HORSEMEN riding
     away. Dawn light beginning to touch the sky.

     WILLIAM LUNGES FOR THE REMINGTON on the ground--

     --but Dan is faster and puts his hand on the weapon.

                          DAN (CONT’D)
               I’ll take care of this.

                          WILLIAM
               No you won’t. ...You don’t take
               care of nothing.

     Tears stand in William’s eyes.

     Dan takes the gun and starts walking back toward the house.

     He passes Alice and Mark, avoiding their eyes.

                          DAN
               The herd is over the ridge by now.
               Get cleaned up.


     INT./EXT. FOLLOWING DAN -- EVANS RANCH -- DAYBREAK

     Dan yanks open a drawer and grabs a shirt. His arms and chest
     streaked in SOOT... Out the bedroom window the sun is
     creeping over the rocky horizon.

     His eyes fall upon a beautiful ANTIQUE BROOCH in a drawer.

     He examines it. It is gold. And he pockets it and turns,
     finding himself looking at William, watching him.

     William turns away, and crosses to his bedroom.

     Dan moves to a basin at the back of the house.

                          ALICE
               You lied to me, Dan.

     Dan turns to face Alice.

                          ALICE (CONT’D)
               You told me we made payments to
               Hollander.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          DAN
               We did. Some.
                    (off look, heading inside)
               How do you think we bought feed,
               Alice? Three months water. Medicine
               for Mark. I had a choice between
               our family and paying it down.

                          ALICE
               We’re supposed to make decisions
               together.

                          DAN
               Would you have made it different?

                          ALICE
               Dan.

                          DAN
               We can’t make it rain together. Or
               turn dust into grass. And we can’t
               hold back winter. It’s too bad the
               doctors at Essex saved so much of
               my leg. I read the pension act pays
               by the pound now.

     Dan leans against the wall, pulling on his boots.

     Tears come to Alice’s eyes.

                          DAN (CONT’D)
               Stop looking at me like that.

     Mark appears in the hall. Dan crosses back to his bedroom,
     pulling on a clean shirt.

                          MARK
                    (as Dan passes)
               ...You gonna tell the Marshal what
               those men did?

                          WILLIAM
                    (from his bedroom)
               Marshal ain’t doing shit.

                          ALICE
               William.

                          DAN
               First thing I’m gonna do, Mark, is
               take you boys and round up the
               herd. ...Then I’m going to town.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     CLOSE ON-- WILLIAM in his room, gettting dressed, listening
     with jaundice as his father reassures Mark. He pockets a deck
     of cards and his dime novel.

                          MARK
               What you gonna do in town?

                          DAN
               I’m gonna tell Hollander to make
               this right. I’m gonna tell him he
               needs to pay for a new barn.

                          MARK
               Maybe we should just shoot him,
               like Will says.

     Alice meets eyes with Dan who grabs HIS SPENCER RIFLE and
     brushes past William on his way to the door.

                          DAN
               ....Let’s go. We got cattle to get.
     7 CLOSE ON: BEN WADE (38)

     --atop a magnificent BLACK MARE, staring at something. Ben
     has a ruggedly handsome face, but what strikes you first is
     his focus. He’s very still, eyes on fire, low to the horse.

     The horse inches forward. Hooves hardly make a sound.

     REVERSE TO REVEAL-- A RED-TAILED HAWK, perched only fifteen
     feet away on the limb of a dead tree.


     WE ARE: EXT. BOULDER CLUSTER, DESERT VALLEY-- CONTINUOUS

     ANGLE ON-- WADE makes a low ‘s’ sound and his horse halts.

     Wade sketches the bird on A SMALL LEDGER PAD with a PENCIL,
     capturing its form with quick gestures. Suddenly: A noise.

     The hawk FLIES OFF. Wade watches it shrink into the sky.

     A darkness fills his eyes.

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL: CHARLIE PRINCE (31), a pale eyed outlaw,
     coming up behind Wade. A PAIR OF SCHOFIELDS on his legs.

     ...he stops his horse respectfully, a few yards back.

                          CHARLIE PRINCE
               Coach is headed for Bisbee, Boss.
               Girded with iron. Pinks on top.
               Double shotguns and a Gatlin--

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     Charlie trails off as Wade rides to the tree, tears his
     SKETCH and pins it to a BRANCH where the hawk had been
     perched. His eyes flick to--

     A DISTANT STAGECOACH, a speck in the valley, kicking dust.

     Wade turns his horse and trots past Charlie...

     Charlie Prince glances at the drawing. HOLD ON: THE SKETCH
     FLUTTERING IN THE BREEZE as Prince follows down the hill.


     8,9 OMITTED


     EXT. BOULDER CLUSTER, DESERT VALLEY - DAY

     Charlie Prince follows as-- Ben Wade rides down past a
     CLUSTER OF BOULDERS where his outfit awaits him:

     JORGENSEN (45): Massive arms and legs. A bear of a man.

     CAMPOS (38): The marksman. Loads a cradled MONSTER RIFLE.

     KINTER (34): A soulless butcher with deadened eyes.

     SUTHERLAND (42): An explosives expert. He supervises as--

     TIGHE (28): his protege, loading TNT in a saddle bag.

     JACKSON (35): Powerful and dangerous. A friend and former
     cellmate of --

     TOMMY DARDEN (28): Battle-scarred handsome face. A BOWIE
     KNIFE in his hand. He is looking to replace Wade and lead the
     gang someday, soon. But in the meantime, he amuses himself
     making trouble with--

     NEZ (32): An Apache renegade. He speaks little English and
     uses it rarely. But he is a great shot, a brilliant rider and
     a merciless fighter. He’s been with Wade since the beginning.

     Darden taunts Nez with his long knife, oblivious to Wade’s
     approach-- He and Jackson trade a chuckle.

     Nez looks at Wade. And Wade looks at Darden hard.

                          DARDEN
               Ben.

     Darden slips the knife back in the sheaf.

     Wade turns his eyes to the road below.

     ...and here comes the STAGECOACH, GETTING CLOSER.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     Wade turns to Charlie and gives a nod...

     ...and the gang surges behind Charlie Prince. As everyone
     rides past him, Campos the marksman looks back to Wade. Wade
     nods to a CLUSTER OF BOULDERS nearby.

     Campos climbs off his horse and scales the rocks.


     EXT. STAGECOACH, DESERT VALLEY - DAY

     CLOSE ON: GALLOPING HOOVES thundering down a desert road.

     A team of FOUR HORSES pulling an ARMORED STAGECOACH through a
     barren stretch of land.

     We see a fancy EYE LOGO stamped upon the door with the famous
     Pinkerton slogan printed below: The Eye That Never Sleeps...

     There are SIX PINKERTONS riding. Two in front, two on a
     mounted “tailgun” platform and two inside, peering out slits.

     THE VETERAN DRIVER pushes the horses.

     Sitting beside him is the sixth man and the group’s leader--

     BYRON McELROY (55). McElroy is clearly not a Pinkerton, and
     hardly dressed or groomed like one. He’s got snake-like eyes.

     He holds a mean-looking, twelve-gauge HAMMER SHOTGUN.


     EXT. FOOTHILLS, DESERT VALLEY - DAY

     Dan’s crouched next to his horse, gazing at one of his cows
     which has collapsed upon the arid earth, gasping...

     Dan glances up at the sky, then he pulls out the BROOCH in
     his grimy hands.

     Twenty feet away, William sits on his horse behind Dan,
     shuffling HIS DECK OF CARDS.

                          WILLIAM
               You gonna hock that?

     Dan pockets it.

                          DAN
               Someday, William. You walk in my
               shoes, you might understand.

                          WILLIAM
               I’m never walking in your shoes.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     Mark calls out from a nearby ridge:

                          MARK
               Tracks over here!

     Dan takes the SPENCER RIFLE from his saddle. Standing over
     the dying creature. Looking in its eyes as he FIRES...
     10C CLOSE ON-- WADE, WATCHING COACH FROM HILLTOP

     The SHOT ECHOES faintly through the foothills. Wade peers
     around behind him. He shrugs it off, focusing back on his
     outfit below.


     EXT. STAGECOACH, DESERT VALLEY - DAY

     McElroy stiffens as-- WADE’S GANG appears suddenly on the
     road ahead coming straight at the coach, head on. McElroy
     sees them and grimaces. Cocking both pins on his SHOTGUN.

                          MCELROY
               Here we go.

     With proficiency, the other Pinkertons flip down or slide
     across several ARMORED STEEL PLATES in front of them...

     ...and in the next second, the outlaws and the Pinkertons
     clash in a violent FUSILLADE OF BULLETS.

     TWO PINKERTONS MAN THE GATLIN mounted at the rear.

     Unfortunately it is exactly where the gang isn’t (they’re
     coming from the front) and they have no shot.

     The Pinkertons fire as Wade’s gang rides straight at them, a
     game of chicken.

     Bullets exploding around him, McELROY AIMS AT ONE OF THE
     OUTLAWS RIDING IN FRONT.

     -- BANG! -- With one shot he blows the outlaw off his horse.

     As the gang swarms around them -- RATATATAT. PINKERTONS FIRE
     THE GATLIN, spraying the gang, mowing down another outlaw.

     Suddenly, one of the Pinkertons on the gatlin falls back,
     shot by-- CAMPOS, at his sniper’s perch-- rifle smoking.

     The remaining Pinkerton cradles the ammo and swings the big
     brass gun at Campos, twisting the crank.

                                3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07 9.

     Campos dives for cover amid a hail of bullets.

     Like fighter pilots, the gang wheels in unison back around to
     catch the coach on another pass.

     CHARLIE PRINCE GALLOPS from the other side of the coach and
     takes out the remaining Gatlin operator with two shots.

                                                     12 OMITTED


     EXT. STAGECOACH-- CONTINUED

     McElroy and the Pinkertons defend the coach valiantly. Taking
     cover behind their ARMORED PLATES as the coach rattles along
     the road. Another Pinkerton climbs from a hatch and re-mans
     the Gatlin. He sends a spray of bullets toward the oncoming
     gang-- another man falls.

     The last Pinkerton (MOONS) inside the stagecoach takes aim
     through the gun slit. He manages to HIT JORGENSEN.

     The big man snaps backwards, falling to the ground, while
     clutching HIS EAR...

     CLOSE ON -- MCELROY’S EYES watching Sutherland and Tighe
     approach from the driver’s side.

                          MCELROY
                    (to driver)
               Get. Down. Now!

     McElroy swings his shotgun over the driver, who ducks, and
     aims at Tighe but then aims lower, at his saddle bag--

     He fires and-- BOOM!-- TIGHE AND HORSE EXPLODE IN MID-STRIDE.

     THE COACH LURCHES INTO A NARROW PASS, making it hard for the
     gang to follow.


     EXT. BOULDER CLUSTER, DESERT VALLEY - DAY

     Wade watches, amused, his eyes on McElroy as he directs the
     coach to make a run for a narrow pass.

     Wade smiles. These two have history. Then, he notices-- A
     SCRAWNY HERD OF CATTLE on the other side of an outcropping.

     Forty cows and bulls nibbling on what little they can find.

     A thought flickers across Wade’s mind.

     And he abruptly wheels his horse towards the animals.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07


     EXT. FOOTHILLS, DESERT VALLEY - DAY

     Dan and his sons have stopped their horses over the ridge,
     listening to the GUNSHOTS. Sounds like a warzone.

     Dan pulls out his SPENCER RIFLE, riding in front.

                          DAN
               Stay behind me.

                                                     15 OMITTED


     EXT. STAGECOACH, DESERT VALLEY - DAY

     THE STAGECOACH RACES through the narrow pass, A PLUME OF DUST
     rising. McElroy squints, seeing--

     A HERD OF CATTLE stampeding toward him. And Ben Wade driving
     them unflinchingly with a stock whip.

                          MCELROY
               Pull up, kid. Pull up!

     The driver stares at the cattle, frozen. Imagine the bull run
     in Pamplona, only you’re driving into it. McElroy lunges for
     the reins pulling hard as HOOVES and HORNS collide.

     The STAGECOACH lists to one side, you can feel the weight of
     this iron carriage. The FRONT AXLE SNAPS. Horses break free--

     The STAGECOACH NOSES INTO AN EMBANKMENT AND FLIPS, rolling
     end over end like a semi on the turnpike. McElroy, the
     driver, and injured Pinkertons catapult to the air.
     16A ANGLE ON: THE OUTLAWS hounding unfortunate survivors.

     Darden touches his BOWIE KNIFE to the chest of A PINKERTON.

                          PINKERTON
               Oh God, Mr. Wade. Please. I got a
               wife and three kids. Please don’t--

                          DARDEN
               What did you call me, boy? I ain’t
               Ben Wade. My name is Tommy Darden.
               Legend with a blade. Soon to run
               this outfit. Say my name. Say it.

                          PINKERTON
               ...I can’t remember it...

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     Darden twists the knife as the driver howls.

     Charlie Prince wields his TWO SCHOFIELDS like the Reaper,
     singing and doing a soft shoe as he puts two Pinkertons out
     of their misery.
     17 CLOSE ON-- BEN WADE

     moves slowly, confidently toward the coach, unimpressed by
     the carnage. Most of the coach horses have run off. A couple
     are on the ground. A few cattle wander about dazed.


     EXT. STAGECOACH, DESERT VALLEY - DAY

     As the dust settles. The outlaws find McElroy pulling himself
     in the dirt, holding his leg, reaching with his other hand
     for his HAMMER SHOTGUN.

                          CHARLIE PRINCE
               Morning, Pinkerton. Name’s Charlie
               Prince. I expect you heard of me.

                          MCELROY
               I heard of a balled-up whore named
               Charlie Princess. That you, missy.

     Darden and Jackson get a chuckle out of this -- Charlie
     Prince smiles, then fires a SHOT into McElroy’s gut...

     ...and McElroy just GRUNTS.

                          CHARLIE PRINCE
               I hate Pinkertons.

     ANGLE ON: BEN WADE riding up now, the gang clearing a path.

     He stops before McElroy and they share a look...

                          WADE
               When’d your hair turn all gray,
               Byron.

     McElroy says nothing. Wade gives a nod to Sutherland who
     rushes up to the PADLOCKED STEEL DOOR on the stagecoach, a
     SATCHEL OF EXPLOSIVES under his arm.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          WADE (CONT’D)
               I heard, Byron, that your boss, Al
               Pinkerton, president of the most
               feared protection agency in all the
               world, home of the eye that never
               sleeps, well, I heard he got an
               infection from biting his own
               tongue ...and died last month. That
               true?
                    (turns)
               Makes you think, don’t it Charlie?

                               3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07 12.

     Some of the gang laughs. As Sutherland sets EXPLOSIVES, Wade
     circles the toppled coach, admiring the ARMORED PLATES.

                          WADE (CONT’D)
               Al spared no expense on this one,
               Byron. Probably cheaper just to let
               me rob the damned thing.

                          MCELROY
               If you’re gonna kill me, I’d just
               as soon get to it.

                          WADE
                    (dismounts)
               I’m not gonna kill you. Not like
               this.

                          MCELROY
               You let me live, it won’t change a
               thing. I’ll come for you.

                          WADE
               Be disappointed if you didn’t.

     BOOM! THE EXPLOSIVES blow the STEEL DOOR off its hinges.

     Moons lies, groggy and bloody on the floor.

     Darden jumps past Sutherland and inside the stagecoach
     (stepping over Moons, who plays dead). He reappears with a
     STRONG BOX. He shoots off the PADLOCK and OPENS the box...

     ...to reveal DOZENS OF CASH ROLLS inside. Railroad money. He
     whoops with joy, tossing the CASH ROLLS to Jackson who puts
     the CASH ROLLS into SADDLE BAGS.

     Wade watches the pair closely.


     EXT. RIDGE, DESERT VALLEY - DAY

     ...From the crest of the ridge, Mark waves to Dan and
     William. Mark sees the HERD and the STAGECOACH WRECKAGE,
     OUTLAWS swarming around it.

     Coming up the rise, Dan goes still at the sight of this.

     He signals silence to Mark. Mark’s horse fidgets.

     Some rocks tumble down the ridge.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07


     EXT. STAGECOACH, DESERT VALLEY - DAY

     ...the robbery is almost over now. Darden emptying out the
     last of the STRONG BOX. Nez packing the CASH in SADDLE BAGS.

     Wade glances at the wounded Jorgensen who’s tied a BANDANNA
     around his ear. He gives the boss a nod, he’s okay.

     All of a sudden ...CLICK! Darden freezes, hearing a PISTOL
     from behind. The rest of the gang goes still, guns ready. As
     Moons climbs out from inside the coach, grabbing Darden,
     hostage-style. He is a blood drenched mess.

                          MOONS
               I’ll ask you to put down the money.

                          DARDEN
               ‘not a good play, friend.

                          MOONS
               ...Step back now. All of you. Hands
               up. Or he dies.

     No one in the gang moves a muscle. Darden tries to free
     himself but Moons holds tight, cocking his weapon to Darden’s
     temple. Darden looks at Wade.

                          DARDEN
               ...Shit.

     -- Wade quick-draws his COLT “PEACEMAKER” -- BANG! -- AND
     SHOOTS DARDEN who spins violently-- grabbing his NECK and
     falling to the ground, mortally wounded.

     BANG! ANOTHER SHOT snaps Moons’ head back.

     He falls to the ground, dead.


     EXT. RIDGE, DESERT VALLEY - DAY

     It’s obviously the first time the children have ever seen a
     killing. Mark is shaken... William fascinated...

     ...and we see that Dan’s all too aware of this.

                          WILLIAM
               He is fast...

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          DAN
               Back up. Quietly. William.

     Rocks start to slide as Dan moves them to a less exposed
     point.

                                                  22-25 OMITTED


     EXT. STAGECOACH, DESERT VALLEY - DAY

     BACK AT THE COACH, WADE reloads his smoking pistol as he
     speaks to Darden stuggling for last breaths on the dirt.

                          WADE
               ...Well, Tommy. It appears there
               was a Pink in that coach you didn’t
               see. Now I don’t know if Charlie
               told you, but we got a few rules in
               this outfit. And this sad outcome,
               well, this is what happens when you
               put us all at risk. You were weak.

     Some rocks fall in the distance, from where Dan and his sons
     are making a retreat. A boy coughs. The whole gang hears it.


     CLICK! CLICK! CLICK!

     Ten guns whip to the ridge. Cocked and leveled at Dan.

     Wade leaps on his his horse, GALLOPING up to the ridge WITH
     CHARLIE PRINCE AND CAMPOS RIGHT BEHIND HIM.

     Jackson starts to pick up the money... ...but Nez gets there
     first. Placing the SADDLE BAGS full of cash onto his horse.

     The other outlaws watch him.


     EXT. RIDGE, DESERT VALLEY - DAY

     Dan rides in front of his two boys as Wade and Charlie Prince
     approach. Wade and Dan stare at one another.

                          WADE
               Morning.

                          DAN
               Those are my cattle. I want them
               back.

                          CHARLIE PRINCE
               Careful, rancher. That’s Ben Wade
               you’re talking to.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     We see William, awestruck.

                          DAN
               I need them back. They’re all I’ve
               got.

                          WADE
               I don’t want your herd. But I’m
               going to need those horses.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          CHARLIE PRINCE
                    (moves forward)
               So you don’t do anything foolish.

     Dan sheaths his rifle and gives his boys a look. They
     dismount and Charlie Prince takes their horses.

                          WADE
               You’ll find them on the trail to
               Bisbee.

     The two outlaws turn, taking the horses, riding down the hill
     leaving Dan his boys.


     EXT. STAGECOACH, DESERT VALLEY - DAY

     ...we FOLLOW Wade, Prince and Campos as they ride away.

                          CAMPOS
                    (quietly, to Prince)
               What’s in Bisbee.

                          CHARLIE PRINCE
               ‘Aint you thirsty.

     Charlie rides past the WRECKAGE and the gang falls in behind.

     Charging down the road. Jackson lags, circling Darden’s body.


     EXT. STAGECOACH, DESERT VALLEY - DAY

     Minutes later. Dan leads his sons through the cattle which
     are milling about the WRECKAGE. Dan looks for survivors.

     DEAD BODIES. A few DEAD STEER.

     And one of the HORSES that pulled the coach, also dead.

     William spots something by Bill Moons’ corpse...

     Three SPENT SHELLS from WADE’S PISTOL. William picks up one
     of the spent shells. Gazing at it like it’s treasure.

     ANGLE ON: DAN as he comes upon McElroy in the dirt,
     bleeding... trying to get up...

                          MCELROY
               Ahhh Dammit!
                    (to Dan)
               Get me on my feet.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          DAN
               I think you’re in pretty bad shape,
               Mister. Maybe you should--

                          MCELROY
               Get me on my damned feet!

     ...As Dan tries to lift him, McElroy grunts and gets upright
     but then his legs give out and he crumbles to the ground.

                          DAN
               Mark, William--
                    (pointing to the wreck)
               Bring me one of them boards.

                                                        CUT TO:


     EXT. BISBEE, SOUTHERN ARIZONA - DAY

     Ben Wade rides, shadowed by Charlie Prince on his horse.

     The rest of the gang is nowhere in sight...

     ...the two men are approaching a remote town -- A dozen
     WOODEN STRUCTURES strewn upon a crossroad.

     Small flags stuck in the dirt, trace the intended path of a
     train line from the mountains. A sign says:


     ANNOUNCING THE BISBEE-CONTENTION LINE.

     A small surveying crew works, laying out the flags.

                                                     31 OMITTED


     EXT. MAIN STREET, BISBEE - DAY

     THE OUTLAWS survey the town as they ride through. There’s a
     SALOON (“Hollander’s”) and around the corner A VETERINARIAN'S
     OFFICE and a BLACKSMITH. A FEW TOWNSFOLK move along, none
     paying much attention.


     EXT. MARSHAL’S OFFICE, BISBEE - DAY

     At the end of the street sits the MARSHAL’S OFFICE, several
     horses tied to the side. Wade dismounts at the corner,
     noticing a BARMAID emerge from a saloon...

     ...this is EMMA NELSON (31). She glances at Wade, meeting his
     eyes, then turns to sweep the porch. A connection.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     Charlie Prince ties his horse further down the block from
     Wade. He glances at Sutherland across the street, tending to
     his horse near a Blacksmith’s shop.

     Off Wade’s glance, Charlie starts to the Marshals’s office.

     FOLLOWING CHARLIE’S BOOTS-- With each step, his gait changes
     from the stride of an outlaw to the amble of a cowpoke.


     INT./EXT. MARSHAL’S OFFICE, BISBEE - DAY

     In the doorway looking out, GRAYSON BUTTERFIELD (36) stares
     at the horizon. His face sour with anxiety. He wears the
     official suit of the Southern Railroad.

     Just inside MARSHAL WEATHERS (42) checks his watch. HIS
     DEPUTY, KANE, rolls a cigarette in the back.

                          MARSHAL
               They’re probably just late, Mister
               Butterfield.

     Charlie Prince leans in the doorway.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               Pinkertons don’t run late, Marshal.
               That’s why they’re paid fourteen
               dollars a day.

                          MARSHAL
               Can I help you?

                          CHARLIE PRINCE
               ...Well ...I think maybe a coach
               headed for here got itself held up
               in a canyon ten miles back. By Ben
               Wade himself, I think.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               God Dammit!..

                          MARSHAL WEATHERS
               How did you know it was Wade?

     OUTSIDE-- BEN WADE watches as--

     Emma crosses inside the saloon with her dust pan.

     Ben pulls his hat low and walks down the plank sidewalk,
     moving closer to the voices in the Marshal’s office...

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          CHARLIE PRINCE
               ‘Can’t say I know it was him. But I
               saw a Mexican sharpshooter, and an
               Apache.

                          KANE
               ...Jesus Christ. Did you see the
               “Hand of God”?

                          CHARLIE PRINCE
               ...What’s that?

                          KANE
               His pistol.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               Why didn’t you do something?

                          CHARLIE PRINCE
               There was a lot of weapons, Mister.
               And they was shooting bullets.

     The Marshal and Kane grab their rifles and move to the door.

     Butterfield follows.


     EXT. MARSHAL’S OFFICE-- CONTINUOUS

     The Marshal and others blow right by Prince as they mount
     their horses. Wade watches from up the street.

                          MARSHAL WEATHERS
                    (to Prince)
               Where you fellas from anyway?

                          CHARLIE PRINCE
               Prairie Cattle Company. Boss
               purchased ten thousand head in
               Mexico, hired us to drive them in.

     The Marshal nods, satisfied and spurs his horse, galloping
     off, down the street.


     INT. HOLLANDER’S MERCANTILE -- CONTINUOUS

     Watching out a window, TUCKER (last seen burning Dan’s barn),
     watches the Marshal and Butterfield ride off.

                          TUCKER
               Something’s going on with the
               railroad man.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     GLENN HOLLANDER (45), the town’s well-groomed saloon owner
     and entrepreneur looks up from his inventory.


     EXT. MAIN STREET-- BISBEE-- CONTINUOUS

     Seeing the street is clear, Charlie Prince nods to Wade.

     Wade crosses, heading toward the saloon doors.

     Charlie follows, passing a look to Sutherland.

     And Sutherland nods to-- Campos, who’s in an alley with
     Jorgensen, helping the big man hold a bloody rag to his
     damaged ear.

     Sutherland also signals Kinter and Nez behind the saloon.

     One by one, the outlaws amble toward the saloon.


     INT. SALOON, BISBEE - DAY

     Wade peers over the SALOON DOORS. The place is empty save one
     old timer. A few tables and chairs, with a bar on one wall.

     Emma turns to see Wade. She keeps her eyes on him as he steps
     inside, his crew following. Most come in from the BACK DOOR.

     Campos and Jackson escort the old timer out. Wade takes a
     place at the head of the bar...

                          WADE
               Whiskey.

     Emma starts pouring them each a shot of WHISKEY.

     Gradually working her way up to Wade.

                          CHARLIE PRINCE
               Here’s to the boss. He leads us to
               the loot and to success. We lost
               three men today and that’s too bad.

                          WADE
               Two died fighting. One was weak.
               We’re only as strong as our
               weakest. Tommy was weak.

     Wade downs his shot with the men. He turns and meets eyes
     with Jackson. Jackson looks away.

     With Nez’s help, Charlie distributes shares from the day’s
     job. A stack of cash to each man. It is a careful process.

     Charlie looks at Wade and Emma, then looks to Nez.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     Nez gets up and leads the gang out the back door.

     Wade’s eyes hold on Emma. Charlie leans beside him.

                          CHARLIE PRINCE
               That Marshal’s only half stupid.
               He’s gonna be back soon.

     Wade just looks at him.

     Outside the window, the gang rides off.

                          CHARLIE PRINCE (CONT’D)
               They’re going across the border. I
               won’t be far. I’ll wait for you.

                          WADE
               Okay, Charlie.

     Charlie exits. Wade finishes his drink. Emma cleans.

                          WADE (CONT’D)
               I’ve seen you someplace before.

                          EMMA
               Have you.

                          WADE
               You ever work for a blind Irishman
               in Dodge City.

                          EMMA
               I was a singer. Best time I ever
               had, my whole life.

                          WADE
               What made you quit.

     Emma turns away, collecting the SHOT GLASSES... ...and Wade
     follows her around the counter.

                          EMMA
               I got to coughing too much. Doctor
               said I should find a drier climate.

                          WADE
               I spent more money in that joint, I
               tell you. Remember a girl, her name
               was Velvet.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          EMMA
                    (her back to him)
               Nobody forgets Velvet.

     Wade reaches out and touches the back of her neck... Emma
     hasn’t been touched like that in a while.

                          WADE
               You know, you look kind of skinny.

                          EMMA
               I feel skinny.

                          WADE
               That’s all right. I don’t mind
               skinny girls, long as they have
               green eyes to make up for it. Do
               you have green eyes.

     She turns, showing him her BROWN EYES...

                          WADE (CONT’D)
               That’s all right... They don’t have
               to be green.

     EXT. CATTLE TRAIL, FOOTHILLS - DAY

     Dan and William carry McElroy along a trail on a STRETCHER
     made of a stagecoach panel. Dan’s in front.

     Mark walks alongside, glancing at McElroy’s WOUND. McElroy
     clutches a rag to it and glares at the sky, muttering.

                          MARK
               ...You think they lied? You think
               they stole our horses.

                          WILLIAM
               Ben Wade don’t need our shit
               horses.

                          DAN
               Watch your mouth.

     Cresting a ridge, they come upon--

     Their horses tied to a tree. Dan is surprised.
     37A MOMENTS LATER-- AT THE HORSES

     William helps his father prop a growling McElroy onto Dan’s
     horse. As Mark mounts up. Dan turns to William.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          DAN (CONT’D)
               ...Take your brother and round up
               the cattle. Don’t push them. I
               can’t afford any more dropping.

     William spits, looking at something, then mounts his horse.

                          WILLIAM
               ...Here comes the Cavalry.

     Dan turns to see-- Marshal Weathers riding up with Kane,
     Crawley and Butterfield. He turns back to his son.

                          DAN
               Do as I said.

     William spurs his horse and leads Mark off, looking back as--

     Butterfield dismounts, crossing to McElroy.

                          MARSHAL
               He from the coach?

                          DAN
               The only one who made it. It was
               Ben Wade.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               Mister McElroy. Can you hear me. He
               needs attention.

                          KANE
               Get him on my horse.

                          MARSHAL
               You see which way they rode, Evans?

                          DAN
               Looked like they were headed to
               Bisbee...

     With dark faces, Butterfield looks to the Marshal and they
     realize...

     INT. EMMA’S BEDROOM-- SALOON - DAY

     Wade relaxes on a chair, wearing only pants. He sketches Emma
     who’s lounging naked in bed in a small room above the saloon.

     She watches him work for several moments, grinning.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     His eyes meet hers. There are sparks between these two. She
     rolls toward him. He reaches out -- touches her ivory skin.

     Out a window, Wade glances at-- Butterfield, Dan, the Marshal
     and his Deputies riding into town, McElroy in tow.

     Wade turns away from the window. It doesn’t worry him.

                          WADE
               ...There’s a town south of the
               border... A pretty little pueblucho
               on the river. Folks would pay good
               money there to hear a white woman
               sing.

                          EMMA
               ....Yeah, imagine me shinning down
               to Mexico with Ben Wade on my arm.

                          WADE
               I’m not wanted in Mexico.

     Emma studies him, wondering if he’s sincere. She breaks a
     smile, like he’s pulling her leg. But his eyes are still.

                          WADE (CONT’D)
               Jump out that back window with me.

     Emma stares at him, mystified, then laughs.

                          EMMA
               You’re crazy.

     She smiles and starts to rolls out of bed, but he pulls her
     back to him and into the soft bed.


     INT. DOC POTTER’S OFFICE, BISBEE - DAY

     A loud knocking. DOC POTTER (42) shuffles toward the door and
     UNLOCKS it. Kane and Dan move in holding McElroy in their
     arms. Butterfield follows. Dan sets McElroy on a BIG SLAB.

                          DAN
               Coach got held up.

                          DOC POTTER
               What’s his name.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               Byron McElroy. He’s a bounty hunter
               under contract with the Pinkertons.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     Butterfield looks about the room. A veterinarian's office. He
     crosses to the window.

     Outside the saloon, the Marshal and Crawley begin to search
     the village for Wade.

                          KANE
                    (crossing to the door)
               I best get out there.

                          DOC POTTER
               You’ve lost a lot of blood, Mister
               McElroy. I’m gonna need to do a
               little stitching on your--

                          MCELROY
               Shut your mouth and do the same to
               my gut.

     Doc Potter blinks. He notes the many scarred-over bullet
     holes and gashes on McElroy’s chest.

     Dan crosses to the door, watching as--

     Kane joins the Marshal and Crawley as they continue moving
     through the town, guns drawn.


     BACK INSIDE--

                          DOC POTTER
               What I’m about to do is going to
               hurt like a sonofabitch...
                    (to Butterfield)
               ...Hold him please.

     Butterfield moves to pin McElroy, but...

                          MCELROY
               Don’t touch me.

     Doc Potter dives a LONG PAIR OF TWEEZERS into McElroy’s
     wound. McElroy grunts fiercely, eyes welling, holding his
     glare with Potter.

     Plink. The bullet’s out. Doc Potter drops it in a dish.

     McElroy turns, noticing the ANIMAL CHARTS on all the walls.

                          MCELROY (CONT’D)
               What the fuck kind of Doctor are
               you anyway?

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          DOC POTTER
               Nice to have a conversation with a
               patient once in a while.

     EXT. BISBEE STREET-- CONTINUOUS--

     Dan makes his way around the corner from Potter’s place,
     moving toward Hollander’s mercantile. He sees--

     Hollander talking to a clerk, through an open side door.

     Dan steps pick up speed.


     EXT. BISBEE STREET-- OUTSIDE BOARDING HOUSE

     Crawley stops in front of Wade’s Horse, runs his hand over
     the animal. This animal is not from Bisbee


     INT. SALOON-- CONTINUOUS

     The Marshal and Kane stand at the entrance of the saloon.

     They look about until they hear a whistle from outside.

     They turn to see-- Crawley pointing to Wade’s horse in front
     of the Boarding House.

     They move quickly to the Boarding House, weapons drawn.

                                                        CUT TO:


     INT. HOLLANDER’S MERCANTILE -- CONTINUOUS

     Dan enters. He meets eyes with Tucker, who assists a clerk
     with inventory. On the other side of the room, Hollander puts
     a Ledger book in his bag and pulls on his coat, watching out
     his window.

                          HOLLANDER
               What the hell are they looking for?

                          DAN
               ...Ben Wade. He held up the payroll
               coach. I was there.

                          TUCKER
               Fuck off, cripple.

                          DAN
               I want to talk, Mister Hollander.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     Hollander moves toward the door, his eyes across the street,
     watching the search. He checks his sidearm.

                          HOLLANDER
               Ben Wade in Bisbee. Shit. We’re
               moving up.

                          DAN
               Mister Hollander.

                          HOLLANDER

               ‘Going to the saloon...

     Dan follows Hollander out the door.


     EXT. BISBEE-- MOVING TOWARD SALOON-- CONTINUOUS

     Dan trails after Hollander along the plank walkway.

                          DAN
               ...You got no right to do what you
               done. You hear me. That’s my land.

                          HOLLANDER
               Come next week, its not, Evans. You
               borrowed a good deal of money. And
               I got rights to recompense.

     Dan grabs Hollander by the collar--

                          DAN
               ...You dammed up my creek. You shut
               off my water. How am I supposed to-
               -

     Tucker come from behind, grabbing Dan, throwing him backward.

     Hollander dusts himself off.

                          HOLLANDER
               ...Before water touches your land,
               Evans, it resides and flows on
               mine, and, as such, I can do with
               it as I fucking please. Go home and
               pack up.

     Dan holds out ALICE’S BROOCH.

                          DAN
               ...Let me just get to spring. I can
               turn the corner.

     CLOSE ON -- HOLLANDER, glancing at it. Not enough.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          HOLLANDER
               ...Sometimes, a man has to be big
               enough to see how small he is. The
               railroads coming. Your land is
               worth more with you off it.

     Hollander turns and climbs the steps and moves through the
     saloon doors, disappearing into an office inside.

     Tucker watches Dan until he starts to walk toward his horse
     in front of Doc Potter’s place.

     CLOSE ON-- DAN. Fire in his eyes, he adjusts his saddle,
     waiting for Tucker to head around the corner, Then, he grabs
     his SPENCER RIFLE and marches for the saloon entrance.

     CLOSE ON-- THE MARSHAL, catching sight of Dan.

                          MARSHAL
               What the hell...


     INT. SALOON, BISBEE - DAY

     Ben Wade slips past Emma, out her bedroom door, moving toward
     the stairs. But his hand moves to his PEACEMAKER when he
     hears--

                          DAN (O.S.)
               Hollander!

     Emma and Wade meet eyes.

     Wade proceeds down the spiral stairs to see--

     Dan, wild-eyed, holding his rifle, standing at the door that
     leads to Hollander’s office...

     Wade approaches Dan. Dan steps toward the bar.

                          WADE
               You look a little bent, Rancher.
               You come to wake some snakes?

     Emma crosses down the stairs.

                          EMMA
               Dan. Would you like a drink.

                          DAN
               No thanks.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     Dan looks at Wade. Heart is in his throat. Sweat on his brow.

     What is he doing here?

                          WADE
               ...You got your horses back, didn’t
               you? And your herd? Dan?

                          DAN
               You killed two of them.

     Wade smiles. He places SIX GOLD COINS on the bar.

                          WADE
               They were thin. But this should
               cover it.

     Dan doesn’t respond. Over Wade’ shoulder, he sees Crawley out
     the windows, moving toward the back of the saloon.

                          WADE (CONT’D)
               What’s a day’s work worth to you?

                          DAN
               I get two dollars when I hire out.

                          WADE
               Here’s two for half a day.

     Wade puts TWO MORE COINS on the bar...

                          DAN
               You took up my boys’ time too.

     Wade adds another two. Shares a look with Emma.

                          WADE
               Anything else you want to get paid
               for, Dan?

     Dan fingers the GOLD COINS. His eyes flick, seeing the
     Marshal enetering from the back door. Leveling a SLIDE-ACTION
     REPEATER at Wade’s back. Wade is about to turn when--

                          DAN
               If it’s alright with you, you can
               give me five dollars extra.

                          WADE
               For what.

                          DAN
               ...For making me nervous.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     Wade’s face changes, something wrong.

     CLICK-CLACK. Marshal Weathers cocks his REPEATER behind Wade.

     Digging the muzzle into the his back.

                          MARSHAL WEATHERS
               Hands up, Ben Wade.

     Tucker appear in the SALOON DOORS, PISTOL drawn.

                          TUCKER
               Boss. Boss!

     Crawley and Kane come in behind the Marshal. Hollander
     emerges fromn his office. Tucker hoots, thrilled.

                          TUCKER (CONT’D)
               Ben Wade captured in Bisbee!

     The outlaw glares at Dan who lets out a breath.

     He keeps his eyes on him as he raises his hands in the air.

                          WADE
               Laugh while you can.

     Kane grabs Wade’s Peacemaker as Crawley locks a pair of HAND
     CUFFS on his wrists. the Marshall grabs Crawley--

                          MARSHAL
               Get the wagon and make sure every
               weapon we got is shoot ready. I’ll
               meet you out front of the office.
                    (to the others)
               We got to get him out of here.

                          TUCKER
               We should shoot him right now. Put
               a bullet in his noggin.

                          MCELROY
               You do that, every man, woman and
               child in this shit-piss town will
               be slaughtered by daybreak.

     Dan and the others look to--

     Byron McElroy in the doorway. Blood seeps from the bandage
     around his gut. He holds his shotgun. Potter trails after
     him, trying to finish his dressing.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          BUTTERFIELD

               Twenty two robberies. Four hundred
               thousand in losses, more in delays.
               The Southern Pacific wants Ben Wade
               convicted in a Federal Court. Hung
               in public. An example made. And we
               will pay to make it happen.

                          WADE
                    (to Dan)
               You notice he never mentioned the
               lives I’ve taken?

                          MARSHAL
               I need three more men.
                    (grabs Wade)
               Let’s go.

     The Marshal escorts Wade toward the door.

                          HOLLANDER
               You can have Tucker.

                          MCELROY
               I’m coming. So you need only one.

                          MARSHAL
               You’re wounded, Mister McElroy.

                          MCELROY
               I can ride a goddam horse as easy
               as I can sit here.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               He knows Wade. You need him.

                          MARSHAL
               If he goes, Potter’s coming.

                          TUCKER
               Doc can’t shoot shit.

                          DAN
               I was the best shot in my regiment.
               I’ll come. For two hundred dollars.

     Everybody turns to Dan--

                          BUTTERFIELD
               You fight for the North or South?

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     Dan looks at the Southern Railroad pin on Butterfield’s
     jacket. Still, he can’t lie.

                          DAN
               ...North.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               We’re Southern in name, but Chicago
               owned.
                    (to the others)
               Fine. Two hundred.

                          DAN
               Thank you.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               Thank me when its done.


     43-48 OMITTED


     EXT. MAIN STREET, BISBEE - DAY

     Dan watches as the Marshal ushers Wade across the street.

     Nearby, Crawley and Kane hustle to prepare a stagecoach,
     tying chain around it to secure the doors.

                          MARSHAL
               Hurry up, Kane.

     CRACK! A SHOT RINGS OUT. It’s Charlie Prince, tearing down
     the street on his horse, a SMOKING SCHOFIELD PISTOL in his
     hands. He gallops down main street, townspeople clearing.

                          CHARLIE PRINCE
               This town’s gonna burn!

     THE OUTLAW GALLOPS PAST. Never slowing.

     He fires twice-- BANG, BANG!

     The first shot drops DEPUTY KANE right in front of the coach.

     The second shot takes down A RANDOM BISBEE MAN.

     Eeryone uinloads their weapons-- BANG BANG BANGG-- as Charlie
     scoots away on his horse, into the hills.


     50-51 OMITTED


     EXT. MARSHAL’S OFFICE, BISBEE - DAY

     Marshal Weathers muscles Wade to a waiting CARRIAGE tied with
     chains and padlocked. Both of them spot --

                               3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07 32.

     Charlie prince-- perched on his horse a half mile out of
     town, watching what happens to his boss. Wade gives him a nod
     and Charlie Prince nods back.

     The marshal shoves Wade inside the coach, then, as he climbs
     onto the driver’s seat-- Emma comes up to the door.

                          EMMA
               Were you sincere about Mexico?

                          WADE
                    (smiles)
               ...No.

     ...WE PULL BACK ON: Emma and the rest of the Bisbee townsfolk
     as they stand back and watch the COACH take Wade away.

                                                  53-55 OMITTED


     EXT. CHAINED COACH, FOOTHILLS --LATE AFTERNOON

     Marshal Weathers hauls ass along a CATTLE TRAIL, ever aware
     that Charlie Prince is following him on the ridge like a dog
     trailing its master...

                                                     57 OMITTED


     EXT. EVANS RANCH, FOOTHILLS -- LATE AFTERNOON

     DAN’S CATTLE are back in the holding yard. Dan stands on the
     porch with Alice. His two boys inside, pressed against the
     windows.

     WHAT THEY SEE: THE PRISON WAGON is passing their ranch,
     crossing a CRUDE BRIDGE over a dry creek bed. They also see
     Charlie Prince crest a nearby bluff, watching the wagon.


     INT./EXT. PRISON WAGON, EVANS RANCH --LATE AFTERNOON

     Inside the wagon, Wade glances at his HAND CUFFS and grins
     self-assuredly. He notices a tear in the seat.

     A PIECE OF COPPER WIRING sticking out.

     All of a sudden, the PRISON WAGON LURCHES TO A STOP. One of
     the wheels has skidded off A CRUDE BRIDGE.

                               3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07 33.


     EXT. PRISON WAGON, EVANS RANCH --LATE AFTERNOON

     Marshal Weathers curses, leaps down and attempts to free the
     wheel.

     Wade glances out through the chained door, watching the
     marshal’s futile struggle...

     ...finally, Marshal Weathers turns to Dan on the porch.

                          MARSHAL WEATHERS
               Hello, there. Evans. Can you give
               me a hand with this.


     EXT. PORCH, EVANS RANCH --LATE AFTERNOON

     On cue, Dan walks out. Tucker and Crawley follow.

                          TUCKER
               Whatever your wife is cooking in
               there smells good, Evans.

     Tucker and Crawley laugh.


     EXT. BLUFF, EVANS RANCH --LATE AFTERNOON

     Charlie Prince squints to get a look at what’s going on as
     the men from the ranch disappear behind the listing PRISON
     WAGON and begin to push it back up onto the bridge.


     EXT. PRISON WAGON, EVANS RANCH --LATE AFTERNOON

     Wade quickly pockets the length of COPPER WIRING as Marshal
     Weathers discreetly UNLOCKS the prison wagon door and hauls
     Wade out. Crawley exchanges hats with the outlaw...

     ...now Marshal Weathers gives Tucker the key to WADE’S HAND
     CUFFS. We see Tucker placing the key in his shirt pocket.

                          WADE
               Remind me never to play cards in
               this town.

     Crawley now takes Wade’s place inside the PRISON WAGON...

     ...and Marshal Weathers PADLOCKS the door again. Wade watches
     the men finally push the PRISON WAGON back onto the bridge.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07


     EXT. BLUFF, EVANS RANCH --LATE AFTERNOON

     The switch has taken just a few fast seconds -- and from his
     vantage point on the bluff, Charlie Prince is none the wiser.


     EXT. PRISON WAGON, EVANS RANCH --LATE AFTERNOON

     Marshal Weathers resumes his seat on the PRISON WAGON...

                          MARSHAL
               Thanks for your help, Dan.

                          DAN
               You gonna check on my family when
               you come back, right?

                          MARSHAL
               First thing. Let’s go. Ya!

     The coach rides off, fast, leaving Wade behind with them.

     A cloud of dust rises.


     EXT. BLUFF, EVANS RANCH --LATE AFTERNOON

     Thinking Wade’s still in the PRISON WAGON, Charlie Prince
     wheels his horse around, GALLOPING away from the ranch...


     EXT. PORCH, EVANS RANCH --LATE AFTERNOON

     ...as Dan and Tucker lead Wade up to the porch. McElroy and
     Butterfield appear in the doorway. Wade nods to Alice, but
     she glares. McElroy pushes Wade inside...

                          ALICE
               How long’s he have to stay.

                          DAN
               An hour. Make sure Wade’s outfit
               takes the bait.

                          ALICE
               What happens if they catch the
               wagon.

                          DAN
               You saw where his man was. He’s
               still got to fetch the outfit. They
               should get to the Fort before dawn.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          POTTER
               His gang can’t do anything in front
               of the whole Sixth Cavalry.


     EXT. EVANS RANCH, FOOTHILLS --DUSK

     Doc Potter keeps watch on Dan’s porch with Tucker. Both men
     cradling RIFLES in their laps.

     Doc Potter stares at the smouldering wreck of the old barn.

                          DOC POTTER
               You have something to do with that?
                    (off Tucker’s smirk)
               Hope you’re proud of yourself.

                          TUCKER
               ...Doing my job, Doc.


     INT. DINING ROOM, EVANS RANCH - DUSK

     Inside, Alice prepares dinner. The two boys carry plates to
     the table where Butterfield is waiting...

     ...we see William, starstruck, offering a plate to Wade who’s
     sitting at the end of the table. He smiles a thanks. McElroy
     sits next to the outlaw, his HAMMER SHOTGUN in his hands.

     Dan sits at the other end of the table, joining Alice and his
     sons. He notices William staring at Wade. Wade nods to
     William and digs into his food. Then Wade looks up, no one
     else is eating.

                          MARK
               We always wait to say Grace.

                          ALICE
               And we don’t presume to teach other
               people manners.

                          MARK
               Aren’t we supposed to say Grace for
               murderers, too.

                          ALICE
               Grace is for everybody, dear.

                          MARK
               Well, then why don’t we say it.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          DAN
               Mark --

                          MCELROY
               I’d like to hear it.

     Everyone looks at McElroy. Wade snorts a laugh.

                          ALICE
               God, our Father, Lord and Savior,
               thank you for your love and favor.
               Please bless this drink and food we
               pray. Bless all who...
                    (glancing at Wade)
               ...who shares with us today. Amen.

     Wade looks up at McElroy who’s watched him throughout...

     ...the others start eating their dinners. William glances at
     Wade constantly. Mark just stares at the outlaw suspiciously.

                          MARK
               You know, if my pa wants to, he can
               shoot you dead. He can shoot a jack
               rabbit at fifty yards.

                          DAN
               Shooting animals is a lot different
               to shooting a man, son.

                          WADE
               No, it isn’t. Not in my opinion.

     Silence promptly falls in the room.

                          WADE (CONT’D)
               Ask Byron here. He’s killed dozens
               of people. Men, women and children.
               Miners. Apache.

                          MCELROY
               There’s not a soul I’ve taken
               didn’t deserve what it got.

     Just the answer Wade was hoping for.

                          WADE
               See, when it comes to killing,
               Byron McElroy doesn’t think in
               terms of man or woman or even
               child...

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          WADE (CONT’D)
                    (pause)
               ...he thinks of souls.

                          MCELROY
               Corrupted souls. Like yours. I
               fight the devil on earth.

                          WADE
               As a bounty hunter for the
               Pinkerton Detective agency and
               eighteen dollars a day plus
               expenses.

                          MCELROY
               Yes sir.

                          WADE
               Every way of man is right in his
               own eyes, Byron. The Lord pondereth
               the heart.
                    (meets eyes with Alice)
               Proverbs... twenty one.

     William smiles. Wade glances at the boy and contentedly looks
     down to his plate. He tries to eat his meat. But its not cut
     up and, with his hands cuffed, not possible... He meets eyes
     with Alice.

                          ALICE
               ...Dan.

     Dan sighs and rises from the table. Takes the plate from
     Wade’s CUFFED HANDS... and cuts the steak.

                          WADE
               Thank you, Dan. Would you mind
               cutting the fat off too, please...
                    (off Dan’s look)
               ...I don’t like fat.

     There is a pause at the table as everyone just watches Dan
     dicing the meat.

                          WADE (CONT’D)
               ...Mind if I ask how you got that
               hitch in your step, Dan?

                          MCELROY
               Don’t tell him nothing, Evans.

                          WADE
               ‘Where were you stationed?

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     Dan hands the plate to Wade.

                          DAN
               ...Second Company Sharpshooters out
               of Lynnfield, Massachusetts.

     Wade smiles appreciatively. Dan crosses back his seat.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          MARK
               My father was defending the United
               States capitol in the District of
               Columbia.

                          WADE
               ...Is that so.
                    (beat)
               So what happened, Dan. To your leg,
               I mean.

     Dan looks to Alice. William looks to his father. Then--

     BANG! BANG!...shots coming from the porch.

     Butterfield stands, frightened. McElroy crosses to the
     window. Dan waves his wife and children to stay where they
     are. He looks to the door, his rifle in his hands.

     MORE SHOTS. Wade, amused, just sits there, chained to his
     chair and the cast iron stove.


     EXT. PORCH, EVANS RANCH - NIGHT

     Dan busts out the door to find-- Doc Potter, firing his RIFLE
     into the darkness as Tucker moves to stop him.

                          TUCKER
               Doc... Stop!

                          DOC POTTER
               ....There’s something moving out
               there behind the rocks.

     ...McElroy and Butterfield arrive in the door-- as they all
     look out, a wind blows a dead tree on a nearby hill. Tucker
     snatches Doc Potter’s rifle.


     INT. DINING ROOM, EVANS RANCH - NIGHT

     Inside, the boys have crossed to windows to watch the men
     argue outside. Wade looks to Alice.

                          WADE
               Ever been to San Francisco?

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          ALICE
               If it’s all right by you, Mister
               Wade, I’d rather we not talk.

                          WADE
               So you’ve never been to San
               Francisco.

                          ALICE
               ...no.

                          WADE
               I knew a girl there... Daughter of
               a sea captain. And she had these
               beautiful green eyes, the greenest
               eyes I’ve ever seen. Like yours.
               And I would look deep into those
               eyes and well, they’d just change
               colors right in front of me. All
               the colors of the sea.

     He stares into Alice’s green eyes and she can’t look away...

                          WADE (CONT’D)
               What’d you say your name was?

                          DAN (O.S.)
               Alice.

     Alice snaps out of his gaze. Wade’s satisfaction is clear.

     He watches Dan cross to the back of the house as Alice
     follows.


     EXT. MASTER BEDROOM, EVANS RANCH - NIGHT

     Dan slams the BEDROOM DOOR behind Alice. He gives her at
     look, then begins packing a SADDLE BAG.

                          DAN
               ...For God’s sake. He’s killed more
               people than the drought.

                          ALICE
               He’s not what I expected. He’s--

                          DAN
               --dangerous. Dangerous is what he
               is, Alice-- and you and the boys
               are not going to talk to him again.

     Alice crosses to the dresser. Dan watches her. She’s upset.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          ALICE
               You can change your mind. No one
               will think less of you.

                          DAN
               No one can think less of me.

     He looks at her, then looks out the window.

                          DAN (CONT’D)
               Six months from now, everything’s
               gonna be green, Alice. Cattle’s
               gonna be fat. We’ll see the steam
               from the trains over the ridge.
               We’ll be all right. Maybe better.
               But we won’t make it through the
               next six days if I don’t do this.

     The door opens--

                          DOC POTTER
               Sorry, Dan,.. Mister McElroy says
               five minutes.

     And closes it. Alice looks to Dan.

                          DAN
               You think he’s too much for me?

                          ALICE
               He’s a killer, Daniel.

                          DAN
               Then someone ought to have the
               decency to bring him to justice.

                          ALICE
               ...What are you thinking.

                          DAN
               I’m not out there alone.
                    (touches her)
               Have a little faith in me.

                          ALICE
               Ben Wade has a gang, Dan. And they
               are out there tonight. Somewhere.

                          DAN
               If I don’t go, we’ve got to pack
               and leave, heading for God-knows-
               where, dirt poor, without a prayer.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          DAN (CONT’D)
               I’m tired of watching the boys go
               hungry. I’m tired of the way they
               look at me. I’m tired of the way
               you don’t. I’ve been standing on
               one leg for three damned years,
               waiting for God to do me a favor,
               Alice. He isn’t listening. It’s up
               to me.

     ...there’s a polite KNOCK on the BEDROOM DOOR.

                          BUTTERFIELD (O.S.)
               Mister Evans. We’re leaving now.


     EXT. PORCH, EVANS RANCH - NIGHT

     The group is saddling up. Wade moves to his black horse, but
     Tucker abruptly cuts him off. A smirk across his face...

                          TUCKER
               No, no, no. This’s my horse now.

     ...and Wade just stares at him, then mounts another horse.

                          WADE
                    (to the group)
               So where are we headed?

                          TUCKER
               Ain’t none of your business where
               we’re headed. You’re a prisoner,
               Wade. You don’t speak, you don’t
               piss, you don’t goddamn breathe
               without our say-so. Understand?

     McElroy rides up, firing a look at Tucker.

                          MCELROY
               We’re going to Contention. We’re
               putting you on the 3:10 to Yuma,
               day after tomorrow.

                          TUCKER
               Shouldn’t have told him that.

                          WADE
               Relax, friend. Now, if we get
               separated, I’ll know where to meet
               up.

     Tucker glares at McElroy who just rides on.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     ANGLE ON: DAN emerges onto the porch with Alice. Their sons
     are waiting for them. Dan looks both of them in the eyes...
     He can see Will’s attention is drawn by Wade.

                          DAN
               Don’t be any trouble, Mark.

                          MARK
               Yes, Sir.

                          DAN
               And William--

                          WILLIAM
               I want to come with you.

                          DAN
               Well, You can’t.

                          WILLIAM
               --I can help.

                          DAN
               You’re fourteen years old.

                          WILLIAM
               I can ride faster and shoot better
               than any one of them. The Pinkerton
               is hurt and Potter’s no good, that
               railroad man is dead weight and
               that other bastard--

                          ALICE
               --William.

                          DAN
               I don’t have time to argue. I need
               you here.

     ANGLE ON: WADE, watching the Evans family. William takes a
     last look his way and storms into the house. Dan embraces
     Alice and Mark goodbye and climb onto his horse. He moves to
     embrace her and her eyes flick to Wade, self-conscious.

     REVERSE-- CLOSE ON DAN-- as they break apart, Wade trots a
     loop around Dan past Alice, politely tipping his hat.

                          WADE
               Appreciate your hospitality, mam. I
               hope I can send your husband back
               all right.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     Alice says nothing. Wade grins, then follows the others under
     McElroy’s vigilant eye.

     THE GROUP rides away from the ranch...

     ...as Alice, Will and Mark remain on the porch, watching them
     disappear into the moonlit hills.


     INT. BOYS’ BEDROOM, EVANS RANCH - NIGHT

     Alice is now putting the boys to bed. Mark is coughing hard.

     It is a deep hacking that clearly isn’t normal, although
     Alice and William don’t seem alarmed. Alice gives him a
     measured spoonful of medicine. It’s all very routine.

                          MARK
               What’d Ben Wade mean about sending
               Pa back all right. Was he saying he
               was gonna kill him?

                          WILLIAM
               He won’t have to lift a finger. His
               gang will do it. They’re the most
               deadly outfit in the whole
               frontier.

     Alice shoots William a look.

                          ALICE
               Your father can take care of
               himself, Mark. Ben Wade likes to
               talk.

     Alice turns off a lamp...

     ...a moment after she closes the door, William sits up in
     bed, still dressed. Mark sits up and watches his brother.

     William pulls a PACKED HAVERSACK from under his bed. Checks
     on the RATIONS he’s wedged inside. We see an old SIX SHOOTER
     PISTOL stuck in there...

     ...he glances at Mark, then quietly opens his window.


     EXT. CATTLE TRAIL, SPUR - NIGHT

     The group is now following the CATTLE TRAIL up a spur. Stars
     light the Heavens above for miles around. It’s beautiful...

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     ...but nobody bothers to notice. The lawmen have their eyes
     on the hills around. Checking every shadow and shape. While
     Wade just looks bored.

     His gaze falls on Tucker riding his BLACK HORSE...

     ...and a smile creases the outlaw’s face. He gives a GENTLE
     WHISTLE, almost inaudible. And the his horse abruptly stops.

     Tucker digs his heels, but the magnificent horse refuses to
     budge until Wade gives another GENTLE WHISTLE. Tucker glares
     at Wade and he just does it again...

     ...and again Wade’s horse stops dead. Tucker fights the horse
     but it’s clear Wade has total control. Stopping and starting,
     amusing himself.

                          MCELROY
               Wade.

     Wade whistles once more to get the horse going again, then
     leaves Tucker alone. There’s a smile under McElroy’s scowl...

                          WADE
               You really think the Marshal’s plan
               is gonna work, Byron. I gotta
               confide in you. I don’t.

     McElroy says nothing.

                          WADE (CONT’D)
               My crew knows all the back roads to
               Fort Huachuca. They’ll catch the
               marshal by daybreak.

                          TUCKER
               What makes you so sure they’ll come
               for you, Wade. Why should they.

     Wade smiles.

                          MCELROY
               They’ll be coming. They’re lost
               without him. Like a pack of dogs
               without a master.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     MCELROY

     ...Doc Potter is pale with concern.

                          WADE
               Have another drink, Doc.

                          DOC POTTER
               I gave that up six years ago. I’m a
               changed man now. A righteous man.

                          WADE
               Trouble the righteous have is being
               able to know right from wrong.

     Doc Potter stares at Wade, unable to answer.

     All of a sudden, McElroy turns to look back at--

     A FIGURE following them on horseback about four hundred yards
     back along a ridge...

     ...the rider seems to be following the group. Disappearing
     around bends or behind trees, only to reappear on the trail a
     few moments later.

     McElroy looks to Butterfield who is alarmed.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               Jesus, no. Not so soon...

     Dan looks to McElroy who stops his horse. The group instantly
     goes on the alert. Weapons up. Fingers on triggers. The
     FIGURE keeps riding towards them.

                          MCELROY
               Off your horses. Move it.

     Everyone obediently does as he says...

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     ...Tucker roughly yanks Wade down to the dirt. Doc Potter
     helps McElroy. Butterfield gathers the horses by the reins.

     Dan, McElroy, and Tucker take up firing positions behind some
     rocks and hedges. Eyes on the cattle trail. Weapons ready...

     ...finally, the LONE FIGURE appears around the bend.

     ANGLE ON: TUCKER as he goes to shoot. Out of nowhere, Dan
     clamps a hand down over his rifle.

                          DAN
               It’s my son...

                          WADE
               Now is that the quiet one or the
               one that doesn’t shut up.

     Dan shoots him a look, then approaches William.

                          DAN
               I told you to stay home.

                          WILLIAM
               I left home. I’m on my own now.

                          DAN
               Goddammit, William. This’s no time
               for games. You turn around. Now.

     Dan gathers his horse. The others respectfully keeping their
     distance and riding on with him. Leaving William behind...

     ...we HOLD ON: WILLIAM upon his horse, not turning around.


     EXT. CATTLE TRAIL, RIDGE - NIGHT

     They’re cresting a ridge now. And William’s still following
     them a few hundred yards back. Dan brews with frustration...

     ...not realizing that Wade is riding nearby, watching him.

                          WADE
               It’s a difficult age. Between the
               hay and the grass, my old man used
               to say.

                          DAN
               He’s stubborn.

                               3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07 47.

                          WADE
               Well, you can’t plant a radish and
               get an onion.

                          DAN
               Don’t talk to me like you know me,
               Wade. We ain’t friends.

                          WADE
               Only a stubborn man would keep his
               family on a dying ranch.

                          DAN
               ...He’s trying to help. He thinks
               he’s looking out for his old man.

                          WADE
                    (smiles)
               You know why I’m so hard to lock
               away, Dan? People like me. Farmers
               give me shelter. Cattlemen give me
               food. Judges let me off. Jailers
               let me out. Law-abiding citizens
               out there feels strangled by their
               shitty little lives. And me...
                    (grins)
               ...well, I’m like the bird that
               should never be caged.

     Wade glances back at William...

                          WADE (CONT’D)
               Your boy isn’t protecting you. He’s
               following me.

     ...and he rides on. Dan watching him.


     EXT. WILLIAM’S CAMP, CATTLE TRAIL - NIGHT

     William cooks his supper on a CAMPFIRE later that night. His
     horse is unsaddled nearby. He burrows into his HAVERSACK and
     pulls out a well-read DIME NOVEL.

     INSERT: THE DIME NOVEL featuring a SILHOUETTED OUTLAW on the
     cover. A smoking pistol in each hand. Rain falling in sheets
     under the lurid title: “THE OUTLAW’S REVENGE!”

     William consumes the pages of the DIME NOVEL with an excited
     grin, glancing at a FLICKERING LIGHT on the trail ahead...

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07


     EXT. CAMP #1, CATTLE TRAIL - NIGHT

     ...it’s the group’s CAMPFIRE. Everyone’s asleep, except for
     Wade who’s staring up at the endless blanket of stars and Dan
     who’s got the watch.

     We see Dan remove the ANTIQUE BROOCH from his pocket, gazing
     at it a moment or two. Rubbing it gently with his fingers.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               ...So were you conscripted into
               Lincoln’s army, Mr. Evans? Or a
               volunteer?

                          DAN
               Neither. Maybe both.

                          WADE
               What’s that mean?

                          DAN
               I was a volunteer in the
               Massachusetts State guard. Then, in
               ‘62, the Federal government was
               running low on men so they called
               in state militias. To protect
               Washington.

                          WADE
               And you got hurt.

     Dan says nothing.

                          WADE (CONT’D)
               What are you doing out here, Dan?
               You got a family at home. You’re
               not a lawman. You don’t work for
               the Railroad. Or Pinkerton.

                          DAN
               Maybe I don’t like the idea of men
               like you on the loose.

                          WADE
               It’s man’s nature to take what he
               wants. That’s how we’re born.

                          DAN
               Well. I make an honest living.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          WADE
               Maybe honest. But I don’t think
               it’s a living. You must be hurting
               bad for money if you took this job.

                          DAN
               Go to sleep.

                          WADE
               I have to imagine being in debt
               puts pressure on a marriage.

                          DAN
               What would you know about marriage.
               We can’t all be cut-throats and
               thieves.

                          WADE
               I know if I was lucky enough to
               have a wife like Alice, I’d treat
               her a whole lot better than you do,
               Dan. I’d feed her better. Buy her
               pretty dresses. I wouldn’t make her
               work so hard...
                    (beat)
               ...yeah, I’ll bet Alice was a real
               pretty girl before she married you.

     ...and Dan just explodes, his RIFLE in Wade’s face.

                          DAN
               Shut up about my wife. You say one
               more word about her and I’ll cut
               you down right here. Right here.

                          WADE
               I like this side of you, Dan.

                          DOC POTTER (O.S.)
               Mister Evans.

     Dan glances aside at Doc Potter...

     ...he’s staring at Dan from under his BLANKET.

     After a moment, Dan lowers his rifle. His hands are shaking.

     His breath calming. Wade watches him cautiously.

     Tucker has also woken up, picking up his own rifle.

                          TUCKER
               Okay... It’s my watch.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     Dan finds a place to sleep as far from Wade as he can get...

     ...as he turns away, we see McElroy under his blanket quietly
     putting the safety on his SHOTGUN. Butterfield sleeps.


     EXT. CAMP #1, CATTLE TRAIL - NIGHT

     Everyone’s asleep now except for Tucker who is sitting near
     Wade, his RIFLE leveled at him as he sings to himself...

                          TUCKER
               ...yes, they’re gonna hang me in
               the morning, before this night is
               done. They’re gonna hang me in the
               morning and I’ll never see the sun.

     ...and Wade just glares at him lethally.

                          WADE
               I suppose it’s too much to ask for
               a little quiet.

                          TUCKER
               I’d be asleep in my bed if it
               weren’t for you. So if I got to be
               up, you’re damn well gonna be up
               with me, Ben Wade.
                    (singing)
               I wanna warn you fellas, tell you
               one by one -- what makes a gallows
               rope to swing is a woman and a gun.

     Wade rolls over, simmering. We see him discreetly remove the
     length of COPPER WIRING from his jacket, twisting it tightly
     around both his hands like a shiv...


     EXT. CAMP #1, CATTLE TRAIL - DAWN

     ...a strange GURGLING NOISE wakes Dan an hour later in the
     dawn light. He focuses on the noise to see Wade kneeling over
     Tucker. Dan scrambles.

                          DAN
               Jesus!

     In the next moment, McElroy lunges at Wade from out of
     nowhere with the butt of his shotgun. Wade falls off Tucker.

     Dropping the COPPER SHIV.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     The others begin to stir now, reacting with shock and horror
     to what Wade’s done. Tucker’s throat has been cut. Doc Potter
     rushes over and searches for a pulse...

     ...he doesn’t find one. His hands close Tucker’s eyes.

     SMACK! McElroy boots Wade savagely in the face. The outlaw
     tumbles. And now McElroy starts to beat Wade, his vigorous
     movements re-opening his own wounds.

     Butterfield and Doc Potter hurry to pull McElroy back.

     Wade notices Dan deliberately hanging back...

     ...and a grin creases his bloody, battered face. That spurs
     Dan forward, pulling McElroy back with sudden force.

                          DAN (CONT’D)
               That’s enough, Mister McElroy.

     McElroy stops, if only because he’s exhausted and weak...

     ...he returns to Tucker and retrieves the HAND CUFFS KEY as
     Wade sits up, nursing his wounds and staring at Dan.

                          DOC POTTER
                    (re: Tucker)
               We have to bury him.

                          MCELROY
               You take the time to dig one grave,
               you might as well dig two.

     And with that, the group reluctantly saddles up. Wade returns
     to his horse, whispering to it soothingly. Reclaiming it.


     EXT. FORT HUACHUCA, ARIZONA - DAWN

     An AMERICAN FLAG droops over the sprawling army barracks at
     Fort Huachuca. The dawn sun glinting over the still sleeping
     town. About a mile away, we find...

     ...a SMALL SPECK racing through a canyon towards the town.


     INT./EXT. PRISON WAGON, CANYON - DAY

     It’s the prison wagon. Marshal Weathers looks exhausted as he
     sits on top, whipping his TEAM OF HORSES through the canyon.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     Crawley keeps a frightened eye out through the PRISON BARS of
     the wagon. A weary smile creasing his face when he spots Fort
     Huachuca in the distance.

     The marshal reaches for his WATER CAN...

     ...BANG! The shot almost takes his head off.

     Marshal Weathers tumbles from the PRISON WAGON, falling right
     past Crawley’s eyes as he smashes lifelessly into a CACTUS.

     ANGLE ON: CAMPOS retracting his SNIPER RIFLE from his perch
     behind a LARGE BOULDER. Charlie Prince pats him on the back,
     watching as the PRISON WAGON HORSES slow to a grateful halt.

     ANGLE ON: CRAWLEY trapped inside the PRISON WAGON. His PISTOL
     drawn as he peers out the PRISON BARS either side of him...

     ...the gang materializes out of the rocks and canyon crevices
     now (PRINCE, CAMPOS, SUTHERLAND, JACKSON). Swarming around
     the PRISON WAGON like bees on a hive. It seems they’re still
     unaware of the switch.

                          CHARLIE PRINCE
               Get you outta there in a second,
               boss. Don’t you worry.

     Jackson grabs the PADLOCK KEY off the MARSHAL’S BELT, giving
     it to Charlie Prince who then goes to open the PADLOCK...

     ...BANG! Crawley catches Charlie Prince with a taut shot. The
     outlaw stumbles backwards. Bleeding from his neck. The bullet
     just scraping him.

     The other outlaws spot Crawley inside...

     ...they draw their guns, ready to finish him.

                          CHARLIE PRINCE (CONT’D)
               Wait.

     He gives a nod to Sutherland who quickly frees the horses
     from the wagon. Now Sutherland sets the PRISON WAGON on
     fire...

     ...the smoke and flames swiftly engulf the old wooden WAGON.

     Charlie Prince stays close. Eyes on Crawley who starts to
     panic inside.

                          CRAWLEY
               Oh, Jesus... Oh, no.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     Charlie lunges and grabs Wades’ black hat off his head.

     He dusts it off as the flames rise in the coach.

                          CHARLIE PRINCE
               Where is he.

                          CRAWLEY
               Open the door. Let me out of here,
               goddammit.

                          CHARLIE PRINCE
               Where’d they take him.

                          CRAWLEY
               I don’t know.

                          CHARLIE PRINCE
               Mister, you better tell me where
               they took him or you will burn.

     The smoke is choking Crawley now...

     ...the flames rising higher every second.

                          CRAWLEY
               Contention... All right. They took
               him to Contention. Gonna catch the
               3:10 to Yuma Prison tomorrow.

                          CHARLIE PRINCE
               You ain’t lying now.

                          CRAWLEY
               I ain’t lying. I swear to God. Now
               let me out of here.

     The gang watches Charlie Prince carefully... He turns his
     back on Crawley in the burning coach.

                          JACKSON
               Contention’s eighty miles back the
               other way.

                          SUTHERLAND
               We’d have to about kill our horses.

                          CHARLIE PRINCE
               So we’ll buy new ones.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          JACKSON
               Charlie. It was his own fault he
               got caught. He made a mistake. He
               was weak.

     Charlie turns red faced toward Crawley, still moaning from
     the burning coach. BANG-- BANG. He fires two shots, silencing
     Crawley, then turns back to Jackson.

                          CHARLIE PRINCE
               ...You think you could do a better
               job leading this crew? Do you?

                          JACKSON
               Maybe. Yeah.

     Charlie Prince lunges quickly at Jackson, smashing his face
     with his pistol, knocking him to the ground, straddling him.

     He levels his two SCHOFIELDS in Jackson’s face. Glancing at
     the others. Nez steps to his side.

                          CHARLIE PRINCE
               You forgotten what you were before
               Ben Wade come along. You forgotten
               what he did for us.
                    (pause)
               We’re going to Contention.

     And with that, Charlie Prince remounts his horse...

     ...and GALLOPS back the other way. The others follow in ones
     and twos. Jackson goes last, not liking this.


     EXT. RACING ACROSS THE RANGE-- DAY

     WADE’S GANG RIDES HARD at full gallop. They are headed back
     toward Bisbee, dust flying in a cloud behind them. We see the
     town of Bisbee in the distance.

     Charlie Prince leads the gang into the mountains.


     EXT. CAMP #1, CATTLE TRAIL - DAY

     William sits on his horse, staring at something in shock...

     ...it’s the body of Tucker. Slumped by the SMOULDERING CAMP
     FIRE. There’s some confusion in William’s eyes. It’s as if he
     doesn’t quite know how to feel.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     Just now, he notices several SMALL SPECKS riding towards him
     on the plains below. He spurs his horse onwards up the trail.


     EXT. PROMONTORY, MOUNTAINS - DAY

     BINOCULAR POV: THE BEN WADE GANG riding hard and fast across
     the endless Arizona plains, perhaps fifty or so miles away.

     ANGLE ON: McELROY sitting on his horse on a high promontory.

     The others grouped around him. McElroy lowers his BINOCULARS,
     his grim face says it all. Wade smirks.

                          WADE
               Can’t say I didn’t warn you.

                          DAN
               There’s a shortcut we could take.

                          MCELROY
               Shortcut.

                          DAN
               Through the pass. Takes you right
               through to Contention.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               Why didn’t you tell us this before.

                          DOC POTTER
               It’s Apache country.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               I thought the government gave them
               land.

                          DAN
               These are the ones refused to go.

                          WADE
               I wouldn’t take that pass.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               You’d rather us take the long way.

                          WADE
               That’s right.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               --and let your boys catch us.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          WADE
               The Apache are skilled warriors and
               marksmen. Even worse, these are the
               stubborn ones who stayed to fight.
               You won’t make it.

     McElroy looks through his BINOCULARS again.

                          MCELROY
               We’ll take our chances.


     EXT. CATTLE TRAIL, MOUNTAIN PASS - DAY

     CLOSE ON: A PAIR OF DEAD, WHITE MINERS lying by the side of
     the trail. Their heads have been scalped. Their bodies left
     to rot in the hot sun...

     ...we find William staring quietly at the corpses as he rides
     past. About a mile ahead, we can see the rest of the group.

     They are on the opposite side of a spreading ravine.


     EXT. CATTLE TRAIL, RAVINE - DAY

     The group is now riding above a ravine. The scenery here is
     spectacular, if a little precarious...

     Dan rides up to Wade, looking at him for a moment.

                          WADE
               Something on your mind, Dan.

                          DAN
               Why’d you kill Tucker. ...Why not
               me. Or Butterfield.

                          WADE
               Tucker took my horse.
                    (beat)
               ...Did you like him, Dan?

                          DAN
               No. He was an asshole. But wishing
               him dead and killing him are two
               different things.

     Wade watches Dan ride ahead.

     After a beat, Wade catches up to him.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          WADE
               Your conscience is sensitive, Dan.
               I don’t think it’s my favorite part
               of you.

     Just now, McElroy falls back beside them.

                          MCELROY
               Shut your mouth, Wade. From here
               out, you want to talk to someone,
               talk to me.

                          WADE
               I don’t like talking to you, Byron.

                          MCELROY
               Not when I have the gun.

                          WADE
               No. It’s not that.
                    (pause)
               You’re just not very interesting.

     Doc snorts a laugh.

                          MCELROY
               That’s right, Doc. Laugh it up.
               Until he guts you like a fish.

                          WADE
               Byron’s like a song with one note.
                    (turns)
               ‘You ever read a book in your life
               besides the bible, Byron?

                          MCELROY
               No need.

                          WADE
                    (turns to Dan)
               Byron acts pious, but a couple
               years back, when he was under
               contract to the Central, I seen him
               and some Pinks mow down thirty two
               Apache, women and children.

                          MCELROY
               Insurgents was cutting down the
               railroad men and their families.
               Picking them one by one off the
               road. Scalping them.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          WADE
               There was little ones running
               around crying and screaming. No
               more than three years old. And his
               boys shot them all and pushed them
               in a ditch, some still crying. I
               guess Byron figured that was fine
               with Jesus, because apparently
               Jesus don’t like the Apache.

     The terrain is getting steeper.

                          MCELROY
               Keep talking, Wade. All the way to
               Yuma. Up them steps. To the rope.
               And straight to hell.

                          WADE
               The day I die, Byron, I’m getting
               sprung from hell.

     Riding in the rear, Dan senses there is someone following
     them. Up front, McElroy looks to Butterfield.

                          MCELROY
               ...I guess maybe I’d feel the same
               way if I come from the seed of a
               drunk grave digger and the rancid
               womb of a whore.

     McElroy grins. Wade is silent. Eyes dark.

                          MCELROY (CONT’D)
               Quiet for once.
                    (looking back)
               What’s wrong, Wade? ‘Cat got your
               tongue? Afraid of heights?

                          WADE
               No. I’m afraid the Apache on the
               ridge might shoot me.

     McElroy whirls around, SHOTGUN raised...

     ...BEHIND HIM, WADE LAUNCHES. LEAPING OFF HIS SADDLE.

     CRASH-TACKLING the Pinkerton with a stunning body-blow.

     They both fall to the ground. Sliding on the steep rock.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     Dan leaps for his rifle but both Doc, frozen, and Butterfield
     fumbling with his pistol, and their spinning horses are in
     the way. It given Wade the moment he needs-- TO LEVEL
     MCELROY’S SHOTGUN AT DAN.

                          WADE (CONT’D)
               Drop it, Dan. Drop it!
                    (to Doc and Butterfield)
               Toss yours down.

     Wade is fiercely angry, eyes a flame. Dan tosses his rifle
     down. Doc and Butterfield also comply. Then, Wade turns hits
     a stirring McElroy brutally with the rifle butt.

     McElroy is delirious as Wade loops his hand-cuffs around his
     boot and drags him to the edge of the ravine.

                          WADE (CONT’D)
               ...I always liked you, Byron. But
               you’ve never known when to shut up.

     He kneels down to the tough old man’s face and pulls him
     upright. McElroy glares at him.

                          WADE (CONT’D)
               Even bad men love their momma.

     And with that, he shoves McElroy off the edge--

     Everyone watches as his body flails, flying downward.

     Wade turns and points the shotgun at Dan and the others.

                          WADE (CONT’D)
               Okay. ...Now its time for everyone
               to go home.

     But there is a click of a gun, and, all of a sudden, Wade
     finds himself feeling the barrel of WILLIAM'S OLD PISTOL to
     his ear. It is tightly gripped in William’s two hands.

                          WILLIAM
               Don’t move, mister Wade. And let go
               of that shotgun.

                          DAN
               William...

     Wade grins at William and the quivering pistol. He doesn’t
     raise his hands. Doesn’t even seem to be concerned.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          WADE
               You’re not gonna shoot a man you
               admire in the back of the head,
               boy. I’m not sure you even know how
               to work that thing.

     BANG! The bullet zips past Wade’s ear, takes down a tree
     branch... ...Ben Wade’s grin promptly disappears.

                          WADE (CONT’D)
               Dan. Tell your son it’s over. The
               Pinkerton’s dead. Let’s go our
               separate ways. You got spread too
               thin. Its nothing to be ashamed of.

                          DAN
               Think you can keep your gun on him,
               William.

                          WILLIAM
               I’m doing a damn sight better than
               you did.

     Dan smiles and crosses to his rifle in the dirt.

     He picks it up, cocks it and aims at Wade.

     The outlaw sighs, begrudgingly impressed. Butterfield’s
     pleased. Doc Potter’s relieved...

     EXT. GRASSY FIELD - CAMP #2 - NIGHT

     WADE, WILLIAM, BUTTERFIELD, DAN and DOC POTTER have camped in
     the middle of a massive field of TALL BROWN GRASS which sways
     softly in the night breeze...

     ...everybody’s hunkered down in a tight circle. Sharing some
     PIECES OF BREAD and a WATER CANTEEN as they keep a vigilant
     watch through the grass.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     Wade notices William nervously shuffling his DECK OF CARDS.

                          WADE
               Your Pa ever take you to some of
               the towns up north? Breckinridge.
               Buena Vista. Leadville?

                          WILLIAM
               No.

                          WADE
               I tell you one thing... They know
               how to shuffle cards in Leadville.

                          DAN
               Stop talking to him.

                          WADE
               I had the best Irish whiskey I ever
               tasted there. A dollar a glass.
               ...There was women in those towns
               who could do things you’d never
               forget.

                          DOC
               Give you a disease you’d never
               forget.

                          WADE
               With money in your pocket you could
               have whatever a man desired or
               needed. I learned everything I know
               there. Landed there no older than
               you. On my own. And I left with the
               start of my gang.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     A wistful smile washes over the outlaw’s face.

                          WADE (CONT’D)
               ‘Course, its all gone now. Silver
               crashed, and then the railroad
               changed everything.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               For the better I am sure.

     The awed look in William’s eyes is killing Dan... ..clearly,
     he doesn’t talk with William like this.

                          DAN
               ...How many men you think you’ve
               killed since you set out with your
               gang, Wade? How many families you
               think you destroyed. Hundreds?

                          WADE
               Quite a few. I’m a bad man, Dan.

                          DOC POTTER
               I heard you dynamited a wagon full
               of prospectors last Spring.

                          WADE
               Now that’s a lie...
                    (to William)
               ...it was a train full.

     William smiles... ...and Dan is crushed.

                          WADE (CONT’D)
               I have to go, Dan.

                          DAN
               You ain’t going nowhere.

                          WADE
                    (shakes his head)
               No. I mean I have to go.


     EXT. TALL GRASS, FIELD - NIGHT

     Dan escorts Wade through the TALL GRASS a short way from the
     camp. The SHOTGUN in his hands, alert for threats.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          DAN
               I’d appreciate it if you wouldn’t
               fill his head with stories of death
               and sin.

                          WADE
               No use hiding the world, Dan. He’s
               trying to decide which way to go.

                          DAN
               He’ll decide better without more
               from you.

                          WADE
               I thought he was gonna shoot me on
               that ravine. There’s wild in his
               eyes. Reminds me of--

                          DAN
               He’s nothing like you.

                          WADE
               The road to corruption is steep and
               slippery, Dan.

                          DAN
               The path of decency is just as
               steep.

     Wade steps away and turns his back to Dan, pissing

                          WADE
               That’s true, Dan. It is. You do one
               good deed and feel all decent.

                               3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07 64.

                          WADE (CONT’D)
               I imagine it’s habit forming. Soon,
               you’re a slave to your decency.
               You’re not a man no more. You don’t
               ever do what you want. Take what
               you want. You don’t know what you
               want. You just keep being decent
               and good till your hollow and dead.

     Dan’s disturbed by Wade’s words...

     ...he gazes through the TALL GRASS back at his son.

     When Dan turns back around... ...Wade has disappeared.

     Dan’s horrified. Rushing through the grass.

     Suddenly, WaDE LEAPS OUT OF THE GRASS AND GRABS DAN, wresting
     * him to the ground. Dan manages to lift his SHOTGUN into
     Wade’s face...

     Wade is shushing him. Looking up to the rocks. Sensing
     something out there.

     BANG! The GUNSHOT comes from nowhere...

     ...and knocks Dan flat on his back --


     EXT. CAMP #2, FIELD - NIGHT

     -- they hear the shot at the camp. William suddenly runs out
     into the grass with his old PISTOL. The others trying in vain
     to stop him --

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07


     EXT. TALL GRASS, FIELD - NIGHT

     -- more BULLETS fly over Wade’s head as William drops down
     beside him, checking on his father. Dan’s wounded. The shot
     clipped his skull...

     ...no time to think, Wade and William grab Dan and begin to
     drag him back towards the campsite. GUNSHOTS ripping through
     the grass on all sides.

     Wade catches glimpses of them in the brush. A flash of BATTLE
     FEATHERS. A swish of RAWHIDE TROUSERS. A glint of a TOMAHAWK.


     EXT. CAMP #2, FIELD - NIGHT

     The horses are freaking out. BULLETS whizzing past their ears
     as Butterfield and Doc Potter help pull Dan into their camp.

     Dan’s starting to regain his bearings, looking about...

     ...the GUNFIRE is coming from three sides. They can’t see the
     shooters through the grass. But the GUNFIRE is volcanic. Wade
     keeps his head low, calculating.

                          WADE
               There’s three of them.

                          DAN
               Yours.

                          WADE
               If they were mine, you’d be dead.

     Dan struggles to cock his SHOTGUN, woozy...

     ...the blood seeping into his eyes and blinding him.

                          WADE (CONT’D)
               Give me a gun.

                          DAN
               No.

                          WADE
               You want them to scalp your boy.

     Dan stares at the outlaw, the GUNFIRE drawing closer...

     ...the others watch from their firing positions, waiting to
     see what Dan’s going to do. Finally, he gives Wade the HAMMER
     SHOTGUN...

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     ...the outlaw checks the TWO SHELLS inside. Then holds out
     his hand for more shells. Dan shakes his head, grimacing in
     pain as Doc Potter tries to staunch the bleeding.

     Wade realizes he’s not getting any more ammo. He scoffs at
     Dan, then cocks both barrels of the shotgun. Waiting for a
     pause in the SHOOTING...

     ...then he scrambles away and vanishes into the grass. The
     others keep their eyes on the TALL GRASS. Praying. Hoping.

     BOOM! They hear the SHOTGUN roar...

     ...no more shooting from the left of them.

     William dares to lift his head. Glancing around at the TALL
     GRASS. Heart in his throat. Waiting. Watching. Lying still.

     BOOM! Another SHOTGUN BLAST out there...

     ...no more shooting from the right of them now.

     Dan keeps his eyes on the RIFLE SHOTS from ahead...

     ...and then all of a sudden, the rifle stops shooting.

     Everyone in the camp listens now to the SOUNDS OF A STRUGGLE
     somewhere out in the grass. Men GRAPPLING and WRESTLING with
     each other...

     ...there’s an ABRUPT GASP. The sound of METAL SLICING FLESH
     and the fall of a body to the ground. Then there’s silence.

     Everybody stares into the swaying TALL GRASS...

     ...and then, a FIGURE appears. Walking towards them.

     It’s Ben Wade. Covered in the blood of others. Looking like
     death incarnate and furious for having been made to kill the
     Apache warriors...

     ...but most alarming is the fact that Wade now has one of the
     feathered APACHE RIFLES in his MANACLED HANDS. The other two
     are slung over his shoulder.

     Butterfield reaches for his rifle...

     ...but a look from Wade makes his freeze.

     Now he aims at Dan like he’s going to kill him.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          WADE (CONT’D)
               I told you not to go this way. I
               told you there’d be trouble.

                          DOC POTTER
               It was Mister McElroy’s decision.

     Wade glances aside at Doc Potter...

     ...then returns his bitter gaze on Dan.

                          WADE
               Give me the key.

     Dan digs the HAND-CUFFS KEY out of his pocket...

     ...then hurls it out into the field of tall grass.

     Everybody watches the key sail through the air, swallowed up
     first by the darkness, then by the endless field of grass...

     ...and Wade just can’t believe it. He zeroes in on Dan. Lifts
     his rifle. And ruthlessly wallops Dan across the jaw with the
     rifle butt. AND DAN BLACKS OUT.


     EXT. CAMP #2, FIELD - NIGHT

     DAN COMES TO SEVERAL MINUTES LATER. Doc Potter sits him up
     with William’s help. Butterfield hovers anxiously behind...

                          DOC POTTER
               Easy does it. Easy.

                          DAN
                    (weak)
               Where is he.

                          WILLIAM
               He’s gone. Took our horses with
               him. I found this in the grass.

     ...it’s the HAMMER SHOTGUN. Taking the gun as he pushes
     himself to his feet. He’s wobbly, but otherwise fine.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               He went that way.

                          DAN
               It’s the fastest way out of the
               pass. He’ll be looking for help
               getting those cuffs off.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          DAN (CONT’D)
                    (to William)
               Find his tracks, son.

                          DOC POTTER
               We’re going after him.

                          DAN
               There’s no reward for getting him
               halfway to that train, is there?

                          BUTTERFIELD
               No, sir.

     Doc Potter considers this as Dan loads his SHOTGUN...


     EXT. BLASTING CAMP, MOUNTAINS - DAY

     ANGLE ON-- BEN WADE as he cautiously approaches a freshly dug
     railroad tunnel. BOOM! A LOW RUMBLING EXPLOSION rocks the
     mountain range and shakes the ground (and vibrates camera).

     Something big is happening on the other side of the tunnel.

     OVER BEN as he emerges from the tunnel to see--

     DOZENS OF CHINESE WORKERS moving about, laying track. Tents
     line the graded earth, sprinkled with woks and bowls.

                               3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07 69.

     A labyrinth of squalid housing. The workers themselves are
     thin and beat to hell. They wear umbrella-like hats to ward
     off the SCORCHING SUN.

     A cloud from the recent explosion billows in the distance.

     Wade rides cautiously through the camp. He betrays no
     emotion, perhaps he has none... ...he’s on a mission, his
     eyes scanning the workers.


     INT. TRAIN CAR, BLASTING CAMP - DAY

     CLOSE ON: WALTER BOLES (48) sucking a cigar at his desk as he
     feeds leftover SCRAMBLED EGGS to a PET MONKEY on a leash...

     ...a sleepy-eyed PROSTITUTE lays on a couch behind him at the
     head of the train car. The windows have all been curtained. A
     bookish TELEGRAPH OPERATOR mans the TELEGRAPH CONSOLE nearby.

     Three RAILROAD ENFORCERS sit about, including ZEKE (44) who’s
     meticulously filing his nails. A BULLWHIP dangles on his hip.

     Boles feeds his PET MONKEY as Zeke speaks long-sufferingly:

                          ZEKE
               Says they want forty dollars each
               month now. Like them Irish up
               north. Goddamn Coolies. They’ll
               work fine with my left boot up
               their asses.

                          BOLES
               If I could teach a monkey to lay
               track...

                          ZEKE
               What we need’s some Negroes brung
               in here, Mister Boles. Show these
               Chinamen what real work is.

     Just now, Boles sees -- Wade riding outside... ...sifting
     through the DUSTY HAZE like a ghost.

                          BOLES
               Holy Christ...

                          ZEKE
               What. What is it.

                          BOLES
                    (pause)
               That’s him.

                               3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07 70.


     INT./EXT. WORKER TENT, BLASTING CAMP - DAY

     A TENT FLAP abruptly peels back to reveal Wade in the opening
     of a CHINESE FAMILY’s tent. A APACHE RIFLE in his hands...

     ...there are several people inside. A MATRIARCH. Three YOUNG
     DAUGHTERS. And a GRANDMOTHER. All of them go still when Wade
     enters their tent.

     Wade scans the tent for threats, noticing a HAMMER and CHISEL
     lying on a stool. He closes the TENT FLAP and advances on the
     frightened family...

     ...pointing to his HAND-CUFFS and the HAMMER and CHISEL.

                          WADE
               You. Break the hand-cuffs. You help
               me. With the hammer.

     Without warning, a VOLLEY OF GUNFIRE rips into the small tent
     from every direction. Dishes explode and splinters fly...

     ...the CHINESE FAMILY hits the dirt with Wade. The MATRIARCH
     pinning her screaming daughters to the ground.

     Wade glances at the CHINESE FAMILY who seem unhurt, but
     terrified, the children screaming in Chinese.

                          BOLES O.S.
               I got five guns on you out here,
               Ben Wade. You best come on out


     EXT. BLASTING CAMP, MOUNTAINS - DAY

     Dan leads our dwindling group through the first tunnel and
     into the blasting camp, staring at the conditions of the
     CHINESE WORKERS.

     ...we notice William caught by the haunted eyes of a teenage
     CHINESE WORKER hauling a basket full of rocks past the group.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               The horses.

     He’s pointing at the TRAIN CAR where their horses are hitched
     to a post. THEY HEAR A MAN SCREAM INSIDE...

     ...the train car is perched on some rails in the middle of
     the camp. Two TELEGRAPH WIRES connect the car to a chain of
     TELEGRAPH POLES.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07


     EXT. TRAIN CAR, BLASTING CAMP - DAY

     CLOSE ON: WADE as Zeke SHOCKS his BARE TORSO with an EXPOSED
     WIRE that extends from A BLASTING BOX...

     ...the two other RAILROAD ENFORCERS gather around with Boles
     and the TELEGRAPH OPERATOR. The PROSTITUTE is in the window.

                          BUTTERFIELD (O.S.)
               What the hell is going on here.

     The two RAILROAD ENFORCERS whirl around with their guns...

     ...and our group stops instantly. Dan lowers his SHOTGUN. He
     glances at Wade. And the exhausted outlaw just smiles back.

                          BOLES
               Mister Butterfield.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               Mister Boles.

                          BOLES
               All finished in Bisbee.
                    (no reply)
               Better hurry. We making the last
               blasts through the mountain this
               week.

     Butterfield nods, tense. Boles waltzes over to him now...

     ...the two men face to face, which unsettles Butterfield.

                          BOLES (CONT’D)
               So what’re you doing in my neck of
               the woods, Mister Butterfield.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               That’s our prisoner. We’re taking
               him to Contention. Putting him on
               the prison train to Yuma.

                          BOLES
               What prisoner. I don’t see anybody
               that’s a prisoner.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               Come now, Mister Boles. That’s Ben
               Wade you have there.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          BOLES
               Ben Wade gunned down my kid brother
               in front of me. Six years ago in
               Abilene.

                          WADE
               Your brother was a lying, bilking
               card sharp. That is, if he’s the
               asshole I remember. He could, of
               course, have been another asshole I
               killed who I forgot about.

     Boles flushes red, glancing at Zeke...

     ...who SHOCKS Wade again. Wade just glares at Zeke, burying
     the pain. And there’s a sudden pang of fear in Zeke’s eyes.

     He stops and Wade finally slumps, held up only by his HAND-
     CUFFS which are looped over a hook attached to the train.

     Dan glances aside at William...

     ...wishing he didn’t have to see that.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               You can’t do this. It’s immoral.

                          WADE
               Morals got nothing to do with it.

                          DAN
                    (pause)
               I was expecting to collect two
               hundred dollars reward for that
               man.

                          BOLES
               That’s too bad, rancher.

                          DAN
               No. Its not. I have to deliver him
               to Contention. I need that money.

                          BOLES
               You need it bad enough to die.

     Dan feels the RAILROAD ENFORCER’s guns on him... ...he stares
     at Wade, then finally relents.

                          DAN
               At least, let us have our horses.

                               3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07 73.

                          BOLES
               I’ve got no problem with that. So
               long as you ride away.
                    (pause)
               Ride away, rancher.

                          WADE
               Nice knowing you, Dan.

     Dan locks eyes with Wade as the others retrieve their horses
     and ride back up to Dan. Boles doesn’t move, watching Dan...

     ...a last look at Wade and Dan turns to his horse.

     Nobody notices Doc Potter pulling a SHOVEL out of a pile of
     rocks. He hefts the tool and swings it with all his might...

     ...WHACK! Straight into a RAILROAD ENFORCER’s face.

     The man tumbles backwards, cradling his BLOODY NOSE.

     Dan seizes the moment, spinning around. Catching Boles in the
     stomach with a powerful right-hand punch. Boles doubles over,
     gaping for air...

     ...it’s all happening so quick, William doesn’t know what’s
     going on. He glimpses Wade using his HAND-CUFFS to lift his
     legs and kick Zeke in the chest.

     The TELEGRAPH OPERATOR drops his pistol and runs...

     ...while the other RAILROAD ENFORCER fires a shot at Dan. The
     shot misses. Dan quickly lays a right hook across Boles’ jaw.

     William spurs his horse forward at the RAILROAD ENFORCER...

     ...who ducks aside just in time. Butterfield rides up to Wade
     with his black horse and the outlaw clambers aboard.


     EXT. BLASTING CAMP, MOUNTAINS - DAY

     Dan takes the lead as the group races through the busy camp,
     heading for the tunnel. CHINESE WORKERS jump aside, clearing
     a path for them...


     EXT. TRAIN CAR, BLASTING CAMP - DAY

     ...meanwhile, Boles and Zeke and the two RAILROAD ENFORCERS
     regroup fast. Leaping onto their horses and giving chase.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07


     EXT. BLASTING CAMP, MOUNTAINS - DAY

     Like mice navigating a maze, the two groups weave through the
     endless rows of tents. BOLES’ GROUP shooting at DAN’S GROUP.


     EXT. TUNNEL, BLASTING CAMP - DAY

     CHINESE WORKERS stream in and out of the tunnel, moving rocks
     in WHEELBARROWS. Some leading PACK MULES with sacks strapped
     across their backs...

     ...they scramble out of the way as Dan and his group barrel
     past into the tunnel. Boles and the RAILROAD ENFORCERS are
     close behind, GUNS BLAZING.


     INT. TUNNEL, BLASTING CAMP - DAY

     CHINESE WORKERS jump to the sides of the tunnel for safety...

     ...the GUNSHOTS echoing like cannon blasts within the narrow
     walls. Oddly, Doc Potter’s got a Cheshire grin on his face.

                          DOC POTTER
               You see me get that one with the
               shovel.

     But before Dan can reply, Doc Potter gasps with pain...

     ...a BULLET striking him between the shoulders.

                          WILLIAM
               Doc.

     He begins to fall off his horse...

     ...but William grabs him, keeping him on.

     They emerge from one tunnel and enter another as--

     BOLES closes in from one hundred feet behind, lining up for
     another shot as he rides. Zeke and the other two are only a
     length behind Boles.

     ANGLE ON: WADE spotting A CRATE OF TNT lying before the next
     tunnel. Hanging low off his horse, WADE SCOOPS A BUNDLE OF
     DYNAMITE --AND TURNS TO DAN.

                          WADE
               If I throw this, can you shoot it?

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     Dan’s answer is cock his rifle. He pulls up his horse to let
     William, Butterfield and Doc rip past. Wade also pulls up,
     heaving the TNT bundle toward--


     A SUPPORT SCAFFOLD ABOVE--

     BANG! Dan fires! And they ride like hell as--


     KABOOM! IT BLOWS.

     Dan and Wade spur their horses and just escape the fiery
     breath of the explosion and the BOULDERS that fall from
     above. The tunnel caves in behind them...

     ...cutting off Boles and his group who’s horses buck from the
     explosion. Boles is singed from the fire and livid, glaring
     at the impasse.

                          BOLES
               Goddammit!


     EXT. TUNNEL, CONTENTION - DAY

     Dan and his group ride out the other end of the tunnel. Wade
     collapses on his horse, the effects of his torture catching
     up with him now...

     ...before he knows it, Dan snatches the HAMMER SHOTGUN back
     and loads a pair of shells. He gives it to Butterfield. And
     helps William ease Doc Potter out of his saddle. They lay him
     under the shade of a nearby tree.

                          DOC POTTER
                    (fading)
               Did we do it. Did we get away.

                          DAN
               Yeah, Doc... Thanks to you.

     Doc Potter smiles, then his body goes limp... ...and Dan just
     stares at him. Wade watches this.

     William’s eyes follow -- The half-built tracks that thread
     into the valley and finally to THE SPRAWLING LOW CITY OF
     CONTENTION TEN MILES OFF.

     Dan’s eyes are heavy. The last forty-eight hours are starting
     to take their toll. Wade studies him.

                                                        CUT TO:

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07


     EXT. TUNNEL, BLASTING CAMP - DAY

     Meanwhile, Boles and the others exit their end of the tunnel.

     Limping back into the camp. Boles barks orders about getting
     their horse to the other side. As they emerge from the
     tunnel, Boles suddenly stops talking.

     WHAT THEY SEE: Charlie Prince and the other outlaws. Perched
     upon their exhausted, sweat-stained horses, they circle
     through the camp and come to a stop at the entrance to the
     tunnel...

     ...they look exhausted, been riding all night.

                          BOLES
               ...Who are you.

                          CHARLIE PRINCE
               We’re looking for a group escorting
               an outlaw by the name of Ben Wade.

                          BOLES
               ...Shit, they just passed through
               here.

                          CHARLIE PRINCE
               That so.

                          ZEKE
               We were chasing them through the
               tunnel.

                          BOLES
               We’re going after them, ‘you want
               to join us.

                          JACKSON
               What’s it to you.

                          BOLES
               Ben Wade shot my brother. In
               Abilene. Six years ago.

                          SUTHERLAND
               Then your brother must be famous.

     This draws some smiles on the outlaws...

                          CHARLIE PRINCE
               You boys some kind of posse, huh.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          BOLES
               You could say that.

     ...and Charlie Prince draws his two SCHOFIELDS.

     They roar as one, catapulting Boles off his horse...

     ...the rest of the gang immediately opens up on Zeke and the
     two RAILROAD ENFORCERS. Riddling them with DOZENS OF BULLETS
     which knock them all to the ground.

     THE CHINESE WORKERS cease what they’re doing, staring at the
     scene. The entire camp frozen as if time has stopped.

     Charlie Prince holsters his guns.

                          CHARLIE PRINCE
               I hate posses.

     He glances at Jackson and Jackson nods...

     ...and the gang rides up towards the mountain.


     108 OMITTED


     EXT. MAIN STREET, CONTENTION - DAY

     As the group rides through town, they see nothing but WHORE
     HOUSES and SALOONS and shops. Stores have IRON BARS on their
     windows, and there’s not a church to be found.

     DRUNKS lay about in the shade. A HORSEMAN pukes while holding
     his horse. Another one takes an endless piss in a back alley.

     Wade catches Dan’s horrified eyes and just smiles...

     ...we see that William is just as surprised as his father.

     The MARSHAL’S OFFICE is right across the street... ...the
     door is barred. A sign reads: “CLOSED FOR REPAIRS”.

                          WADE
               Congratulations, Dan. You made it.
               Contention City. The future of
               Bisbee. In all its glory.

     Six blocks away, beyond a cattle yard-- THE NEW TRAIN DEPOT.

     A clock tower above tells us its quarter to one.

                               3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07 78.

                          DAN
               We need a place to lay low. Keep
               him out of sight till the train
               comes.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               There’s a hotel this way. You ride

     PAN TO REVEAL-- A fancy hotel sits on Main Street, the
     tallest building in the town. Butterfield leads them toward
     it...

                          BUTTERFIELD (CONT’D)
               I’ll check us in. You keep riding
               and amble round back.

                                                110-111 OMITTED


     EXT. HOTEL BACK / ALLEYWAY CONTENTION - DAY

     Dan and the others dismount at the back entrance of the
     hotel. It’s quieter here. A few TOWNSMEN walking past at the
     mouth of the alley. None of them seem to notice Wade.

                          DAN
                    (to William)
               Keep a watch by the rail head. If
               you see them coming --

                          WILLIAM
               -- I’ll let you know.

                          DAN
                    (pause)
               William.

     The boy looks back at his father...

     ...but Dan just smiles and William nods and rides off.

     Wade sees the pride in Dan’s eyes.

     They notice a COOL WIND picking up now.


     EXT. STREETS, CONTENTION - DAY

     William does a thorough reconnaissance of the obnoxious town,
     trotting down ALLEYS and eyeballing SUSPICIOUS CHARACTERS...

     ...he’s taking his job very seriously, clutching his PISTOL.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07


     EXT. HOTEL BACK, CONTENTION - DAY

     A DANCE HALL ENTRANCE feeds from the alley where a sign
     broadcasts the times of performances.

                          WADE
               There’s a Can-Can at two, if you’re
               interested.

     ...just now, Butterfield opens a BACK DOOR.


     INT. LOBBY, CONTENTION HOTEL - DAY

     The lobby is quiet. A few men at the bar. The BARTENDER is
     the only one who seems to notice Wade. Watching Butterfield
     lead them up the stairs.


     INT. BRIDAL SUITE, CONTENTION HOTEL - DAY

     Butterfield UNLOCKS the door to a room covered in hearts.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               It’s the Bridal Suite. Hope you
               don’t mind, it’s all they had.

     He gives Dan his golden POCKET WATCH.

                          BUTTERFIELD (CONT’D)
               I’m going to go see if I can find
               the marshal.

     Wade takes a seat on the DOUBLE BED while Dan checks out the
     room. He peels back the CURTAINS to reveal a huge BAY WINDOW
     that overlooks the street below.

     WHAT DAN SEES: A DARK CLOUD BANK building on the horizon in
     the distance. Rain clouds.

                          WADE
               Well, would you look at that.

     ...a flicker of confusion crosses Dan’s face.


     EXT. MAIN STREET, CONTENTION - DAY

     William also sees THE RAIN CLOUDS down on the street below as
     he rides towards the entrance to town. He’s as shocked as Dan
     is...

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     ...he glances back hesitantly at the hotel, then rides on.


     INT. BRIDAL SUITE, CONTENTION HOTEL - DAY

     Dan gazes at the clouds, then turns to see Butterfield and
     Wade looking at him.

                          WADE
               Still need that two hundred, Dan.

                          DAN
               Shut up.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               Mister Evans, you continue to give
               me great confidence.

                          DAN
               It ain’t 3:10 yet.

     Butterfield leaves and Dan LOCKS the door behind him.


     INT. LOBBY, CONTENTION HOTEL - DAY

     Butterfield hurries back down the stairs to the lobby. Again,
     we notice the BARTENDER watching. Something wrong about him.


     INT. BRIDAL SUITE, CONTENTION HOTEL - DAY

     Dan hangs the POCKET WATCH on a COAT RACK. Wade rests on the
     DOUBLE BED, feeling its bounce as he surveys the small room.

                          WADE
               So this’s the bridal suite, huh. I
               wonder how many brides...

     Dan just looks at him, unamused. He takes a seat in a ROCKING
     CHAIR by the window. Rests the HAMMER SHOTGUN on his lap, the
     rifle close...

     ...and he just stares out the windows at those blessed clouds
     on the horizon. For the first time in a long time, things are
     actually looking good.

     Wade reclines on the bed, gazing at the ceiling.

                          WADE (CONT’D)
               What are you gonna do with your two
               hundred now that rain’s coming.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          DAN
               I owe people money, Wade... The
               drought left me in the hole.

                          WADE
               Well, think about about doubling
               that money. Pay your debts and buy
               a dozen more cows. Build new yards.

                          DAN
               How you reckon I’m gonna do that.

                          WADE
               Drop your guns and let me walk out
               of here. That’s worth four hundred
               dollars to me.

                          DAN
               That what you reckon my price is.

                          WADE
               No... No, I reckon your price is a
               thousand. One thousand dollars.

     Dan says nothing.

                          WADE (CONT’D)
               There was at least that much on
               Butterfield’s coach. You want it,
               Dan. It’s yours.

                          DAN
               Isn’t that reckless of you, Wade...
               Seeing as you’re so sure your crew
               is coming to get you.

                          WADE
               Oh, they’re coming, Dan. I just
               like to do things easy. Peaceful.

     Wade sits upright on the bed.

                          WADE (CONT’D)
               Imagine what you could do with a
               thousand, Dan. Hire ranch hands so
               your boys can go to school, grow up
               smart. Become leaders. Senators and
               Congressmen. And what about Alice,
               huh. She’d be the proud wife of the
               biggest rancher in Arizona...
                    (pause)
               ...all you have to do is say yes.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     For several moments, Dan’s clearly tempted...

                          DAN
               Would you send me a bank note. Or
               maybe you’d be kind enough to make
               a deposit it for me. Tell me, Wade.
               How would I account for all that
               money. What would I say to people
               when I spend it. You got the jump
               on me. You escaped. And I somehow
               got a fortune. How dumb you think
               people are.

     Wade just glares across the room at him.

                          WADE
               Nobody needs to know.

                          DAN
               Do me a favor, will you. Don’t talk
               to me for a while.

                          WADE
               You mean, we’re still not friends.

                          DAN
               No. We’re not.

                          WADE
               Well, at five minutes to three,
               Dan, we’re gonna be a whole lot
               closer than you think.

     And the way he says this gives Dan the chills. Dan glances at
     the POCKET WATCH on the wall: It’s still only one-thirty.


     EXT. HOTEL, CONTENTION - DAY

     A STRONG WIND propels the RAIN CLOUDS over the sprawling city
     of Contention. Shrouding the hotel in a blanket of shadows...


     INT. BRIDAL SUITE, CONTENTION HOTEL - DAY

     ...it’s two-fifteen now. And Dan’s sweating, even though the
     temperature has plummeted in the last forty-five minutes. A
     sudden KNOCK at the door.

                          DAN
               Who is it.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          BUTTERFIELD (O.S.)
               It’s me, Dan. I’ve brought some
               help.

                          DAN
               You been gone a long time, Mister
               Butterfield. How do I know somebody
               ain’t got a gun on you out there.

     Something appears under the door. It’s a TIN STAR.

     Dan picks up the TIN STAR then UNLOCKS the door for
     Butterfield who shows in MARSHAL DOANE (54) and three other
     stalwart DEPUTIES. All armed with PISTOLS and RIFLES...

     ...all the men stare at Wade cautiously. He gives them a dark
     look. Dan’s very relieved to see them, shaking their hands.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               Dan, this is Marshal Will Doane.

                          MARSHAL DOANE
               Mister Evans, three of my finest
               men. Harvey Pell. Sam Fuller. And
               Herb Baker.

                          DAN
               Sorry about all that, marshal. I
               really am grateful for the help.

                          MARSHAL DOANE
               Don’t mention it.

                          WADE
               You fellas really gonna help put me
               on this train.

                          MARSHAL DOANE
               It may not look like it, but this
               town’s got law and order just like
               any other.

     Wade just scoffs, unimpressed...

     ...he glances at Butterfield.

                          WADE
               How much is Butterfield paying you.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               That’s none of your business.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          WADE
                    (smiles)
               You gonna come with us, too.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               Oh, I’ll be walking with you. Every
               step of the way... You have my word
               on that, Dan.

                          DAN
               So there’s six of us. Six is good.


     EXT. RAIL HEAD, CONTENTION - DAY

     We find William still at his vigil on the edge of town, his
     eyes on the mountains. He begins to see something out there.

     WHAT WILLIAM SEES: A tell-tale PLUME OF DUST billowing over a
     rise. Swirled about by the wind. And then, a HORDE OF HORSES
     explodes over the rise...


     EXT. ENTRANCE TO CONTENTION - DAY

     ...it’s Charlie Prince and the rest of Wade’s gang. They’re
     riding fast and hard. Down from the mountain. Following the
     half complete tracks from the tunnels into Contention.

     Their horses are exhausted. Bloody and sweaty. The outlaws
     are on the shoot. Their dark, flinty eyes set on Contention.

                                                    125 OMITTED


     INT. BRIDAL SUITE, CONTENTION HOTEL - DAY

     An urgent KNOCK on the door in the bridal suite.

                          WILLIAM (O.S.)
               They’re coming, I’ve seen them.

     Dan quickly opens the door for his son.

                          DAN
               Where.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          WILLIAM
               About a mile out. Same way we come.

                          MARSHAL DOANE
               How many are they.

                          WILLIAM
               Ten or eleven.

                          MARSHAL DOANE
               Which is it, boy. Ten or eleven.


     EXT. MAIN STREET, CONTENTION - DAY

     The Ben Wade gang reaches Contention now, GALLOPING into town
     like they own it. People move off the streets.


     INT. LOBBY, CONTENTION HOTEL - DAY

     ...meanwhile, Marshal Doane positions his deputies in the
     lobby. The few people here quickly abandon the place, which
     annoys the BARTENDER.

                          MARSHAL DOANE
               Move along, folks. That’s it. Keep
               the doors clear. Thank you.

     The three deputies take up firing positions inside the lobby.


     INT. BRIDAL SUITE, CONTENTION HOTEL - DAY

     Marshal Doane returns to the Bridal Suite now, joining Dan
     and William by the window. Eyes on the bend in the road up
     ahead as the gang finally appears...


     EXT. HOTEL FRONT, CONTENTION - DAY

     ...there’s a curious crowd outside the hotel now. And not a
     decent soul among them. They’re the sort of filth and vermin
     that often collects in these new railroad towns.

     Charlie Prince notices them and stops the rest of the outlaws
     outside. The BARTENDER sees Charlie Prince through a window.


     INT. LOBBY, CONTENTION HOTEL - DAY

     In the lobby, the three deputies start to get nervous.

                               3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07 86.

                          DEPUTY BAKER
               Sure are a lot of them.

                          DEPUTY FULLER
               I didn’t figure on it being the
               whole gang.


     INT. BRIDAL SUITE, CONTENTION HOTEL - DAY

     Marshal Doane stares down at the gang, confidence faltering.

     Dan backs up against the far wall, protectively drawing his
     son with him.


     EXT. HOTEL FRONT, CONTENTION - DAY

     Charlie Prince notices the BARTENDER who gives him a look,
     directing his eyes up to the second floor BRIDAL SUITE...


     INT. BRIDAL SUITE, CONTENTION HOTEL - DAY

     ...we see the gang from the Bridal Suite on the street below.

                          CHARLIE PRINCE
               Hey, boss. You in there. Boss!

                          WADE
               What should I tell them?

                          DAN
               Tell them you’ll write them a
               letter every day from Yuma.

                          WADE
               Charlie. Go buy the boys a drink,
               I’ll be down soon.

     Charlie hurls Ben Wade’s hat up to the overhang.

     Ben grabs it. Puts it on.

                          CHARLIE PRINCE
               You okay.

                          WADE
               Sure, I’m okay.

     And he sits back on the bed...

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07


     EXT. HOTEL FRONT, CONTENTION - DAY

     Below, Charlie Prince turns to the growing CROWD.

                          CHARLIE PRINCE
               Listen up. Listen. That’s Ben Wade
               they got up in there. The railroad
               means to put him on the 3:10 to
               Yuma and hang him.


     INT. LOBBY, CONTENTION HOTEL - DAY

     The three deputies in the lobby stare out at Charlie Prince.

                          DEPUTY FULLER
               What’s he doing.


     EXT. HOTEL FRONT, CONTENTION - DAY

     Charlie Prince rides over to Nez’s SADDLE BAGS and shows the
     crowd a HANDFUL OF DOLLARS taken from Butterfield’s coach.

                          CHARLIE PRINCE
               We’ll give two hundred cash dollars
               to any man what shoots any one of
               them.


     INT. BRIDAL SUITE, CONTENTION HOTEL - DAY

     Dan, Butterfield, William, Marshal Doane watch with dread.

                          CHARLIE PRINCE
               Two hundred dollars guaranteed.

     The deputies can see guns out the windows in all directions.

                          DEPUTY FULLER
               ...gotta be thirty, forty more guns
               out there now.


     INT. BRIDAL SUITE, CONTENTION HOTEL - DAY

     Marshal Doane watches the army amassing outside. He glances
     at Butterfield and Dan, then he turns for the door.

                          MARSHAL DOANE
               Aw, to hell with this. Let’s go,
               boys.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               Now just a minute, Marshal --

                          MARSHAL DOANE
               Look, if it’s a fair fight... Well
               sure, I’d stay for that... A fair
               fight, that’s a man’s duty... But
               there’s only six of us. I’m sorry,
               mister. But I am not gonna die
               today. And neither are my men.

                          DAN
               Marshal. You forgot this.

     Dan tosses the TIN STAR back at the marshal... ...he catches
     it, glares at Dan, then walks out.


     INT. LOBBY, CONTENTION HOTEL - DAY

     Butterfield pursues Marshal Doane down the stairs. Doane nods
     at his deputies and they gratefully follow him out the doors.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               I’ll double your money.
                    (no reply)

                               3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07 89.

                          BUTTERFIELD (CONT’D)
               Please. Do you want to see us shot
               down in the street.

                          MARSHAL DOANE
               Look, this thing happened in
               Bisbee. Why bring your troubles to
               Contention.

                          DEPUTY PELL
               We’ve got families. Every one of us
               is a family man.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               I’m a family man, too.

                          MARSHAL DOANE
               Then you best get out like us.

     And out they go. Butterfield looks pale. HE turns, looking
     about, mind racing.


     INT. BRIDAL SUITE, CONTENTION HOTEL - DAY

     Meanwhile, back up in the bridal suite...

                          WADE
               You see, Dan. Everyone wants to
               live. And that means Butterfield,
               too. He’ll walk out on you. He’s
               gonna come back up here and walk
               out on you, Dan. Now what do you
               figure you and your son are gonna
               die for. Because Butterfield’s
               railroad lost some money.

     ...and Dan has no reply. He looks at William.


     EXT. HOTEL FRONT, CONTENTION - DAY

     Charlie watches the marshal and deputies walk out guns down.

     GUNSHOTS RING OUT as he murders them. Inside, Butterfield
     shudders. Prince turns to the BRIDAL SUITE WINDOW...

               Almost.

               Your turn, general.

                          WILLIAM
               What do you expect him to say.

                          WADE
               I expect him to say something that
               makes sense. Something that might
               save the two of you.
                    (pause)
               Take a look, Dan... What’s the
               matter, don’t you want to see them.

                          DAN
               I’ll see them soon enough.

                          WADE
               How about you, kid. You wanna look.

                          DAN
               Stay away from the window, William.

                          WADE
               Go on. Look down there.

     William looks at his father and then at Wade...

     ...venturing to the window and staring at the gang.

                          WADE (CONT’D)
               They’re animals. All of them.
               They’ll kill you and your father,
               William, and they’ll laugh while
               they do it. I think you know that.

     William looks at Wade.

                          WILLIAM
               Call them off.

                          WADE
               Why should I.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          WILLIAM
               Because you’re not all bad.

                          WADE
               Yes I am.

                          WILLIAM
               You saved us from those Indians.

                          WADE
               I saved myself.

                          WILLIAM
               You helped us through the tunnels,
               you helped us get away.

                          WADE
               If I had a gun in those tunnels, I
               would’ve used it on you.

                          WILLIAM
               ...I don’t believe you.

     Wade smiles.

                          WADE
               Kid. I wouldn’t last five minutes
               leading an outfit like that if I
               wasn’t as rotten as Hell.


     EXT. HOTEL FRONT, CONTENTION - DAY

     Outside, Charlie Prince gives a nod to the gang and they all
     split up. Disappearing into the streets and back alleys with
     the dozens of CONTENTION GUNMEN.

     Butterfield peeks nervously out the front of the hotel. He
     sees all the gunmen waiting outside. And makes a decision.

     Charlie setlles into a chair across the street, watching.

     He checks the watch he stole from the dead Pinkerton.


     INT. BRIDAL SUITE, CONTENTION HOTEL - DAY

     The DOOR OPENS suddenly and Butterfield comes inside the
     Bridal Suite. He looks stricken. Wade instantly reads the
     look on his face. Butterfield crosses to the window.

                          WADE
               Here it comes...

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          BUTTERFIELD
               Dan.
                    (beat)
               I can’t do it.

                          WADE
               They say discretion is the better
               part of Valor.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               If you think you have an obligation
               to me or the railroad, you don’t.
               I’m releasing you.

                          WADE
               So it’s just you now, Dan. And your
               boy.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               You have no obligation.

                          WADE
               Listen to what he’s saying.

                          WILLIAM
               Maybe he’s right, Pa. Maybe we
               should go home.

                          DAN
               What did Doc Potter give his life
               for, William. And McElroy.

                          WADE
               They’re specks, Dan. Little red
               ants on a hill.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               I’ll pay you the two hundred, Dan.
               Right now. And you can walk away.

     Dan has to laugh. He looks out the window, knowing this is
     the decision of his life.

                          DAN
               ...You know... this whole ride,
               it’s been nagging on me. That’s
               what the government gave me. For my
               leg. A hundred ninety eight
               dollars, thirty six cents.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          DAN (CONT’D)
               Funny thing is, when you think
               about it, which I have been lately,
               they weren’t paying me so I could
               walk away. They were paying me so
               they could walk away. So they could
               forget the people that got maimed
               and killed for their own interests.

     Butterfield is stung.

                          WADE
               Don’t muddy past and present, Dan.

                          DAN
               I’m seeing the world as it is,
               Wade. What’s two hundred gonna do.
               By the time I get back, Hollander
               will want more.

                          WILLIAM
               If you take him to the train, Pa,
               I’m going with you.

                          DAN
               No. Mr. Butterfield is taking you
               home.

                          WILLIAM
               I’m not going anywhere with him.

                          DAN
               Yes you are.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               ...I’ll get him to Bisbee, Mr.
               Evans. I promise you.

                          DAN
               You’re gonna promise more than
               that, if I put the scourge of the
               Southern Line on that train. I want
               a guarantee that Hollander and his
               boys never set foot on my land
               again. And that my water’s gonna
               flow. And I expect you to hand my
               wife one thousand cash dollars when
               you see her.

     Wade smiles, amused.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          DAN (CONT’D)
               ‘You got it to spare, Butterfield.
               You were gonna divvy up a thousand
               to five for a job I’m doing alone.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               My company will be glad to do all
               of those things ...if Wade gets on
               the train.

                          DAN
                    (to Wade)
               Youu heard him.

     Wade nods. Satisfied, Dan turns to William. He pulls out
     Alice’s ANTIQUE BROOCH... ...and hands it to him.

                          DAN (CONT’D)
               Bring this back, William. Tell your
               mother... Tell her I had it with me
               to the end. That it helped me find
               what was right.

                          WILLIAM
               Pa. I can’t... just leave you...

                          DAN
               I’ll be a day behind you, William.
               ...Unless something happens,.. And
               if it does, I need a man at the
               ranch. To keep it running and
               protect our family. I know you can
               do that because you’ve become a
               fine man. You got all the best
               parts of me, William, what few
               there are.

     Dan embraces his son. Wade watches them, reluctantly moved...

                          DAN (CONT’D)
               Just remember how your old man
               walked Ben Wade to the station...
                    (pause)
               ...when nobody else would.

     Dan gives Butterfield a look.

                          DAN (CONT’D)
               You take him and find a room down
               the hall.

                              3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07 94A.

                          WILLIAM
               Pa.

                          DAN
               When we make the move, we’ll pull
               his gang away. And that’s when your
               ride out of town.
     Butterfield crosses to the door. After a look from his
     father, William goes with him. Holding his father’s eyes as
     he leaves the room.

     INT. BRIDAL SUITE, CONTENTION HOTEL - DAY - CONTINUOUS

     Dan checks the time: Five minutes to three.

                          DAN
               Goddammit...

                          WADE
               You know, squeezing that watch
               ain’t gonna stop time.

     Dan angrily hurls the POCKET WATCH at Wade...

     ...it misses by an inch, SMASHING against the wall.

                          WADE (CONT’D)
                    (smiles)
               Now you shouldn’t get so scared,
               Dan. Might back a bad move.

     And Dan just turns away, staring out the window.


     EXT. STREETS, CONTENTION - VARIOUS - DAY

     Every now and then we glimpse one of WADE’S GANG. Hidden in
     alley ways. Or climbing on roof tops. Loading their rifles.

     Elsewhere, we see CONTENTION GUNMEN readying to earn a buck.


     154 OMITTED

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07


     INT. BRIDAL SUITE, CONTENTION HOTEL - DAY

     Dan sits in the ROCKER, staring at the rumbling STORM CLOUDS.

     Wade lies on the bed, DRAWING something in a HOTEL BIBLE...

     ...we can’t quite see what he’s drawing. And his eyes never
     seem to leave the page. His thoughts drifting as he speaks:

                          WADE
               You ever read the Bible, Dan.
                    (no reply)
               I read it one time... I was eight
               years old. My daddy had just got
               himself killed over a shot of
               whiskey. My mother said we were
               going back east to start over. She
               gave me a Bible and sat me down at
               the train station. Told me to read
               while she went to buy our tickets.
                    (pause)
               Well, I did as she said, read that
               Bible from cover to cover. Took me
               three days. She never came back.

     Just now, they hear a CLOCK CHIMING in the distance...
     ...it’s the CLOCK TOWER by the train station: Three o’clock.

                                                    156 OMITTED


     INT. BRIDAL SUITE, CONTENTION HOTEL - DAY

     Dan listens to the chimes, like daggers in his chest. As they
     finish, he gathers his HAMMER SHOTGUN and turns to Wade.

                          DAN
               It’s time.


     INT. CORRIDOR, CONTENTION HOTEL - DAY

     The BRIDAL SUITE DOOR cracks open and Dan peers out...

     ...the corridor is empty and quiet. Dan pushes Wade through
     the doorway with BUTTERFIELD’S RIFLE. The HAMMER SHOTGUN is
     slung over Dan’s shoulder.

     Dan keeps close to Wade as they walk down the corridor, eyes
     on the CLOSED DOORS than line the walls. One of them opens a
     little suddenly...

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     ...and Dan lines up on it. But it’s just an OLD MAN peeking
     out. He quickly closes the door. Dan and Wade keep moving.


     INT. LOBBY, CONTENTION HOTEL - DAY

     The hotel lobby is deserted, a contrast to the way we first
     saw it. Only the BARTENDER’s still here...

     ...he watches Dan come down the stairs with Wade. He takes
     out a BOTTLE OF WHISKEY and pours two shots on the bar.

                          BARTENDER
                    (to Dan)
               On the house, mister.

     Dan stares at the drinks, then leads Wade to the bar...

     Dan and Wade drink the shots. Dan thanks the BARTENDER with a
     look, then presses on. The BARTENDER watches them go.

     ANGLE ON: DAN & WADE reaching the BACK DOOR they came through
     before. Dan trades a look with Wade as he clutches the BACK
     DOOR HANDLE.

                          WADE
               There’s still time to get out of
               this.

     Dan looks at the outlaw, a thousand thoughts racing through
     his head. Then he cocks the SHOTGUN. And turns the handle.

     The BACK DOOR swings open... and a BLAST OF WIND rushes in.

     Dan grasps Wade by the BACK OF HIS COLLAR, laying the barrel
     of the SHOTGUN over Wade’s shoulder as they creep outside.


     EXT. HOTEL BACK / ALLEYWAY CONTENTION - DAY

     The outlaw scans the ROOFTOPS and ALLEYWAYS as Dan pushes him
     out the door. Both men quickly realize their horses are gone.

                          WADE
               Didn’t expect them to let us ride
               to the station, did you.

     All of a sudden, Campos appears on a rooftop...

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     ...and Dan hurls Wade behind a STACK OF CRATES as the outlaw
     shoots his rifle. BANG! The round misses Dan by inches.


     EXT. ROOFTOP, CONTENTION - DAY

     Campos keeps his rifle trained on the STACK OF CRATES as he
     swiftly cocks the LEVER ACTION, chambering a new round as--

     DOWN BELOW-- Dan and Wade scurry toward the end of the alley,
     heading for cover under an overhang.


     EXT. BACK ALLEY, CONTENTION - DAY

     --BANG-- Campos fires again. Dirt sprays up at Dan as he
     shoves Wade below the overhang.

     ...under the deck, Dan tries to get a look at Campos. He
     scans the roofline, considering his options.

     Dan turns and follows Wade’s glance to a large bullet hole in
     the top of his boot. If Dan had a foot, his toes would have
     been blown off. He looks up at Wade. Almost laughs.

     Wade nods as a LOCAL GUNMAN lunges from a corner...

                          WADE
               ...uh ...behind you.

     ....AND DAN WHIPS AROUND, FIRING THE SHOTGUN. BOOM!

     He drops the Gunman.

                          WADE (CONT’D)
               ...Figure I owed you one for
               getting me out of that camp.

                          DAN
               Thanks...

                          WADE
               Now you’re on your own. ...And only
               five blocks to go.

     It’s a wide street, no cover. Not good. The depot far in the
     distance. A clock at the General Store reads Four past three.

     Dan studies the roofline... Tries to get a fix on Campos.

                          DAN
               Where’s the rest of them.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          WADE
               ...waiting.

                          DAN
               Tell your rifleman, he shoots at me
               again, I’ll just put a bullet in
               your head.

                          WADE
               And what do I tell them?
     FOUR LOCAL GUNMEN are coming up the wide street that leads to
     the station. Two of them are shit-faced drunk, SHOOTING in
     the air, one hooting... Dan’s eyes find another, pistol
     trained on them from across the street.

     |...and then they begin FIRING.

                                                        CUT TO:


     162AA INT. HOTEL ROOM / STAIRS-- DAY -- CONTINUOUS
     Butterfield and William stand frozen, listening to the shots
     RING OUT. Unable to stand anymore, William suddenly makes a
     run for it.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               Son! Stop!
     William races down the hall with his pistol.


     162A UP THE STREET-- CHARLIE PRINCE--
     --watches the gunfire with satisfaction. He glances to
     Jackson. Sutherland watches from behind.

                          JACKSON
               ‘Might not ever have to touch your
               Scofields, Charlie...

                          CHARLIE PRINCE
               That’d be disappointing.
     Charlie’s grin fade as--
     --THE FUSILLADE BECOMES FURIOUS, INSANE. BULLETS SHATTER THE
     BARRELS and roof around DAN AND WADE. The gunmen fire
     indiscriminately and Wade seems as likely to get shot as Dan.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          JACKSON
               ...What happens if they shoot the
               boss, Charlie?

                                                        CUT TO:


     162B BACK ON-- DAN AND WADE-- UNDER THE OVERHANG
     AS A WOOD POST BY WADE’S HEAD EXPLODES WITH SHELLFIRE.
     Cursing, WADE DIVES FOR COVER WITH DAN.

                          WADE
               ...This is bullshit.
     UP THE STREET-- CHARLIE PRINCE REACTS.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          CHARLIE PRINCE
               Hey! ...Hey! Not the black hat!

     Red faced, CHARLIE CHARGES AT THE GUNMEN, firing.

                          CHARLIE PRINCE (CONT’D)
               I said the rancher, you dumb-shits!


     CAMPOS HAS FOUND A NEW VANTAGE POINT ON THE ROOFTOP.

     He starts picking off the locals.

     As does Sutherland from another vantage point.
     162C UNDER THE OVERHANG-- DAN AND WADE--

                          DAN
               Let’s go. Now.


     WADE’S ENTIRE GANG IS FIRING ON THE LOCAL GUNMEN.

     It looks and sounds like war.

     Dan seizes the moment, grabs Wade and breaks into a sprint
     across the wide street. They run through the hail of gunfire.

     DAN HITS JACKSON WITH A SHOT, shoves Wade in the door of-


     INT. MINING SUPPLY SHOP -- DAY

     As they enter, a shot clips Wade in the shoulder, knocking
     him back. Dan spins, firing at--

     A LOCAL GUNMAN who drops.

     Lungs clutching for air, Dan glances out the door behind
     them, shots still reporting from the street.

     Dan drags Wade toward the back of the store and goes about
     reloading his guns. Suddenly--

     --POW! WADE HITS HIM in the face with cuffed fists and shoves
     him against a wall, each with their hands on the shotgun.

                          WADE
               That’s enough, Dan. Its over.

                          DAN
               We’re going to the train.

                          WADE
               No. We’re not. 3:10 TO YUMA - TAN -
               1.23.07 100A.

     DAN STRUGGGLES to regain control of the gun. As they thrash A
     SHELF SPILLS. Suddenly, A LANTERN NEAR DAN’S HEAD EXPLODES
     FROM GUNFIRE.

     From the store window, Jorgenson and Kinter try to pick off
     Dan. Dan shoves Wade back and spins, taking a shot-- killing
     Jorgenson and sending the rest for cover

     DAN
     We’re going to the train, Wade.

     As Dan grabs at Wade, trying to drag him further, Wade just
     stands there, unmoving. Dan pulls at him, as more shots ring.
     *

     Suddenly, Wade kicks out DAn’s good leg, sending him down the
     * steps into A STOCKROOM--

                              3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07 101.


     WADES STANDS OVER HIM.

                          WADE
               Your boy’s gone home. No one’s
               watching. You were a hero once. You
               got one good leg to show for it.
               Use it to get home.

     Wade turns his back on Dan and faces the door outside--

     Shots still ring out.

                          WADE (CONT’D)
               Charlie-- Hold up. ...Charlie!
               We’re comin’ out.

     Suddenly, Dan grabs Wade around the neck and pulls him to the
     * stockroom floor. They roll, punching at each other. Hard. *

     Wade ends up with his cuff chain around Dan’s neck, pining *
     him. Dan looks up at him-- intense.

                          DAN
               ...I never been no hero. Only
               battle I ever saw, my company was
               in retreat. We was running through
               the woods under fire from our own
               side. By the time I got to the
               river, everyone else had fallen...
               and my foot was gone... and still
               don’t know how. All I know is I
               lost it running, scared and blind
               and in retreat. You try telling
               that story to your little boy,
               Wade. And you watch his eyes.

     Wade takes this in. The chain loosens around Dan’s neck.

                          DAN (CONT’D)
               I am not afraid to die. Not no
               more. Only thing scares me now is
               running away.

     A beat.

                          WADE
               ...Okay, Dan.

     Out the cracked stock room door, DAN SPIES A ROOF WORKER’S *
     LADDER.

     EXT. ROOFTOPS, CONTENTION - DAY

     Dan pulls Wade across the CITY ROOFTOPS dodging WILD GUNFIRE
     from below. Dan stops before jumping over a narrow alleyway.

                          WADE
               You sure you can take it.

     Dan jumps pulling Wade with him. The impact sends a spasm of
     pain through his bad leg.

     They jump a second alleyway. Dan is in agony.


     EXT. MAIN STREET, CONTENTION - DAY

     ...as Charlie Prince and the others chase them on the ground,
     shooting at silhouettes. Attempting to outrun them to the end
     of the chain of buildings.


     EXT. ROOFTOPS, CONTENTION - DAY

     BANG! BANG! BANG! Splinters fly as Dan and Wade rush towards
     the last rooftop now. Both of them leaping off the edge...


     EXT. MARKETS, CONTENTION - DAY

     ...and CRASHING through a CANVAS AWNING which lands them both
     on a FOOD STALL. Dan quickly draws his WINCHESTER on Wade...

     ...the two men finally catching their breath together now.

                          DAN
               Worked alright, didn’t it.

                          WADE
               Yeah... Worked real good.

     Wade grabs an APPLE from the food stall...

     EXT. TENT CITY / MOVING TOWARD THE STATION - DAY

     Dan and Wade run in tandem through the CANVAS TENTS in which
     the railroad workers live. In a spray of gunfire, they move
     from blazing light to dark. Bullets make silent holes in the
     dark canvas.

     BANG! BANG! BANG! The shots come at him from all sides...

     ...several of shots clip Dan’s arms and legs. One of them
     even blows his hat right off his head. Dan shoves Wade
     forwards -- both of them hobbling now.

     Ten yards to go. Three more tents.

     The outlaws charge after them.

     Just five yards now. A HAIL OF GUNFIRE chasing them.


     INT. TICKET BOOTH, TRAIN STATION - DAY

     Dan yanks open the door to the ticket booth. All but throws
     Wade inside. Bullets CRACK and SPLINTER off the wooden booth
     as Dan dives inside...

     ...the TICKET CLERK crouches in the corner. Staring at the
     two men. Dan is weak, bleeding from several wounds.


     EXT. TICKET BOOTH, TRAIN STATION - DAY

     Outside, Charlie Prince and the others gather quietly around
     the booth. Twenty feet away. No chance of escaping this one.


     INT. TICKET BOOTH, TRAIN STATION - DAY

     Dan keeps his gun on Wade as he looks at the TICKET CLERK.

                          DAN
               What...what time is it.

                          TICKET CLERK
               About ten past three.

                          DAN
               Where’s the 3:10 to Yuma.

                          TICKET CLERK
               Running late, I suppose.

                          DAN
               How late.

                          TICKER CLERK
               Beats me... It gets here when it
               gets here, don’t it.

     Dan stares at the man blankly...

     ...and Wade just breaks into a smile.

                          WADE
               Goddamn trains. Never can depend of
               them, huh.

     INT. BRIDAL SUITE, CONTENTION HOTEL - DAY

     William barges into the Bridal Suite to find it’s empty. Only
     a wafer-thin PIECE OF PAPER torn out of the HOTEL BIBLE lying
     on the rocker...

     ...he picks up the paper and we see a SKETCH of Dan sitting
     on the rocker with his SHOTGUN.


     INT. TICKET BOOTH, TRAIN STATION - DAY

     Inside the booth, Dan winces with the pain rippling through
     his body. He has GUNSHOT WOUNDS in his arms and legs. Blood
     also trickles from a head wound...

     ...Wade takes a KERCHIEF out of his pocket and begins to make
     a TOURNIQUET around Dan’s leg.

                          WADE
               You stupid sonofabitch. I’ve given
               you every opportunity to get out of
               this and now look at you.

     Wade finishes tying the TOURNIQUET...

     ...and Dan just gazes at him gratefully.

                          DAN
               I ain’t stubborn...

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

                          WADE
                    (confused)
               What.

                          DAN
               At the camp, you said I was
               stubborn for... For keeping my
               family on that ranch...

                          WADE
               Yeah well, what else you call it.

                          DAN
               It’s my son... Mark... The younger
               one. Got tuberculosis when we was
               two... Doctors said he’d die if
               he... He didn’t have a dry climate.

                          WADE
               What’re you telling me this for.

                          DAN
                    (shrugs)
               Guess I wanted you to know I’m not
               stubborn is all ...Ben.

     Wade stares at Dan’s grin, and starts to smile himself.


     EXT. TICKET BOOTH, CONTENTION - DAY

     Outside, the whole towns seems to be lying in wait. Charlie
     Prince is the closest to the TICKET BOOTH, trying to see in.

     ANGLE ON: WILLIAM riding up behind the outlaws, joining a
     CROWD OF PEOPLE venturing out to witness the showdown...

     Butterfield rides up beside William. It’s clear to all where
     Dan and Wade are. Jorgensen rides up, towing WADE’S BLACK
     MARE behind him as William quickly peels his horse away.


     INT. TICKET BOOTH, TRAIN STATION - DAY

     Back to Dan and Wade in the ticket booth...

                          WADE
               Long as we’re making confessions.

                          DAN
               Yeah...

                              3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07 107.

                          WADE
               I’ve been to Yuma Prison before.
               twice before. Escaped twice, too.


     EXT. CATTLE YARD, TRAIN STATION - DAY

     Meanwhile, William rides to the CATTLE YARD next to the
     station. He dismounts, keeping hidden...

     ...as he makes his way through the CATTLE towards the gate.


     INT. TICKET BOOTH, TRAIN STATION - DAY

     Wade stares at Dan in the ticket booth...

                          WADE
               There’s no sense putting me on this
               train, Dan. I’ll be out within the
               week.

     ...and Dan just stares at him, wounded, fading.


     EXT. CATTLE YARD, TRAIN STATION - DAY

     Now William quietly slips the CATTLE GATE open, then scuttles
     back to his horse. The CATTLE stay in their yard, confused...


     INT. TICKET BOOTH, TRAIN STATION - DAY

     ...as Wade makes his final plea to Dan:

                          WADE
               You made it further than anybody
               ever expected. Most of all, me. You
               did it. Go on home to your family.

     Dan looks at him. Suddenly, they hear a TRAIN WHISTLE.


     EXT. TRAIN STATION, CONTENTION - DAY

     Here she comes, the 3:10 to Yuma. A STEAM-POWERED LOCOMOTIVE
     hauling seven TRAIN CARRIAGES and a JAILHOUSE CABOOSE...
     ...all heads turn to watch as she puffs towards the station.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07


     INT. TICKET BOOTH, TRAIN STATION - DAY

     Dan and Wade peer over the TICKET COUNTER and see the train
     coming towards them. And Dan just starts checking his ammo,
     gearing up for the last few yards.

                          DAN
               Do me a favor, will you... When you
               break out of Yuma, don’t go back to
               your crew.

                          WADE
               What.

                          DAN
               Hang up your guns, settle down
               somewhere. Raise a family...
                    (pause)
               ...that’s what you want, isn’t it.

                          WADE
               What the hell do you know about
               what I want.

     Dan finishes RELOADING.


     EXT. TICKET BOOTH, CONTENTION - DAY

     Charlie Prince keeps his SCHOFIELDS on the ticket booth as
     the train nears the station.

                          CHARLIE PRINCE
                    (to the gang)
               They’ll be coming.

     ...the other outlaws now prepare for the final shoot-out. The
     crowd, including Butterfield, watching anxiously behind them.


     EXT. CATTLE YARD, TRAIN STATION - DAY

     William gets ready on his horse at the back of the CATTLE as
     the LOCOMOTIVE rolls past, HISSING STEAM out its wheels...


     EXT. TICKET BOOTH, TRAIN STATION - DAY

     ...pulling into the station as the DOOR OPENS on the ticket
     booth. Dan escorts Wade out, the HAMMER SHOTGUN at his back.

                              3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07 109.

     The OUTLAWS and the CONTENTION GUNMEN get set to fire...


     EXT. CATTLE YARD, TRAIN STATION - DAY

     ...but then William suddenly fires a shot from his old PISTOL
     and the spooked CATTLE begin to stampede out the open gate.


     EXT. TICKET BOOTH, TRAIN STATION - DAY

     Dan sees his son deftly whipping up the cattle...

     ...and for a moment, Dan’s furious. But then he realizes that
     William’s driving the CATTLE between them and the outlaws.

     The animals steam past the outlaws, blocking their line of
     fire. Charlie Prince falls beneath them, engulfed in PLUMES
     OF STEAM from the LOCOMOTIVE...

     ...we hear him SCREAM as the cattle trample him.

     Dan and Wade break for the JAILHOUSE CABOOSE at the back of
     the train. Keeping their heads low just beyond the CATTLE.


     EXT. JAILHOUSE CABOOSE, TRAIN STATION - DAY

     An old PRISON GUARD on the JAILHOUSE CABOOSE sees Dan coming
     with Wade. He rises to his feet, grabbing the JAILHOUSE KEYS
     off the rack behind him...

                          DAN
               I’ve got a prisoner to go to Yuma.

     Wade looks at Dan who appears shocked to have made it here.

     To have been able to say those eight words.


     EXT. TRAIN STATION, CONTENTION - DAY

     Nobody can see anything through the large HERD OF CATTLE. Not
     even WADE’S GANG who are effectively cut off from their boss.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07


     EXT. JAILHOUSE CABOOSE, TRAIN STATION - DAY

     A smile spreads across Dan’s weary face. Wade smiles, too.

     Genuinely happy for him.

     BANG! A GUNSHOT echoes through the train station.

                          WADE
               No.

     Dan SCREAMS with pain, returning fire...

     ...it’s Charlie Prince. Materializing out of the steam. Beat-
     up from the CATTLE STAMPEDE. Dan’s SHOTGUN clips his arm.


     EXT. TRAIN STATION, CONTENTION - DAY

     Everybody hears the shots. Peering through the rain and steam
     from the locomotive. The outlaws pushing through the cattle.


     EXT. JAILHOUSE CABOOSE, TRAIN STATION - DAY

     BANG! BANG! BANG! Charlie Prince cuts Dan down...

     ...ripping into his legs, his arms, his chest. The HAMMER
     SHOTGUN falls to the soggy ground. His body spun around.

     Wade leaps off the JAILHOUSE CABOOSE, flinging himself into
     the line of fire. Charlie Prince stops firing just in time.


     EXT. TICKET BOOTH, TRAIN STATION - DAY

     CLOSE ON: WILLIAM seeing his father fall as the cattle parts
     fifty feet away. A river of shock grips him like a vice.


     EXT. JAILHOUSE CABOOSE, TRAIN STATION - DAY

     ANGLE ON: WADE helpless to save Dan who collapses into the
     mud, a look of shock on his face. Wade grinds to a halt next
     to him...

     ...kneeling beside him, cradling the dying rancher’s head in
     his lap. Charlie Prince triumphantly reloads his SCHOFIELDS.

                          WADE
               Dan.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     Dan looks up at Wade, bloody and weak... ...a faint grin...


     EXT. TRAIN STATION, CONTENTION - DAY

     Stricken, William stares at his father, twenty yards off, in
     Wade’s arms, frozen. Butterfield approaches from behind.


     EXT. JAILHOUSE CABOOSE, TRAIN STATION - DAY

     The other outlaws walk up now, holstering their weapons and
     fetching horses. Gathering around Wade in a loose circle...

     ...as Charlie Prince struts over and grabs a CUFFS KEY from
     the PRISON GUARD. He UNLOCKS Wade now, dropping the key and
     the cuffs as he walks off.

     Charlie Prince spits at Dan’s feet.

                          CHARLIE PRINCE
                    (laughing)
               For a one leg rancher, you was one
               tough sonovabitch.

     Wade gently sets Dan down. His gaze falls on the HAMMER
     SHOTGUN lying nearby... his eyes go stone fucking cold.

     CLOSE ON: CHARLIE PRINCE who has taken only a few steps, when
     he stops. An alarming sixth sense telling him to turn around.


     EXT. TRAIN STATION, CONTENTION - DAY

     William tries to run to his father, tears in his eyes, but
     Butterfield grabs hold of him... pulls him under an overhang,
     they are both getting wet.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               You need to stay here, son.

     William kicks and claws at Butterfield.

                          WILLIAM
               Let go of me!

                              3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07 112.

                          BUTTERFIELD
               You can’t help him right now.


     EXT. JAILHOUSE CABOOSE, TRAIN STATION - DAY

     ...the outlaws have gone rock still in the rain. All eyes on
     Wade and the SHOTGUN. Wade is just as still and silent.

     Suddenly, Charlie Prince draws...

     ...BOOM! The HAMMER SHOTGUN bellows.

     Catapulting Charlie back three feet.


     EXT. TRAIN STATION, CONTENTION - DAY

     As the shot rings out, William turns-- becomes still.

     Everybody’s stunned and riveted.

                          MAN
               He shot one of his own men... He
               just shot him.


     EXT. JAILHOUSE CABOOSE, TRAIN STATION - DAY

     Wade’s gang is shocked... ...and livid. Staring at Charlie
     Prince lying on the ground. What happens next takes no more
     than twenty seconds.

     Jackson draws his rifle on Wade...

     ...BANG! The shot scrapes Wade’s shoulder.

     And Wade lifts the HAMMER SHOTGUN and fires. Jackson vanishes
     in a CLOUD OF SMOKE. And Wade tosses the empty shotgun aside.

     Sutherland and Jorgensen draw their guns now... ...as Wade
     dives and rolls towards Charlie Prince.

     Snatching the two SCHOFIELD PISTOLS from his hands. The pair
     of outlaws shoot at Wade as he comes up out of his roll and
     blasts them both away.

     Now Campos draws. And BANG-- Wade takes him out with ruthless
     precision. Campos unloads his weapon as he falls backward.

     One shot clips Wade in the arm.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07


     EXT. TRAIN STATION, CONTENTION - DAY

     William watches Wade twenty yards away through the rain...
     ...a dark, silhouetted outlaw brandishing DOUBLE PISTOLS. He
     is terrifying. A mad-dog killer. Face twisted with pain.

     William walks toward the gunfire. When Butterfield lunges at
     him, but William knocks Butterfield back with a look.


     EXT. JAILHOUSE CABOOSE, TRAIN STATION - DAY

     Wade spins around on the last outlaw now... It’s Nez. Lining
     up on his boss. He hesitates when their eyes meet. And in
     that moment, Wade fires.

     Nez takes a blast to the chest but stays upright. He looks at
     Wade, sad. Wade shoots him again. And again. This is not easy
     for Wade. Finally, Nez topples.

     Wade turns, eyes filled with emotion, noticing--

     A mortally wounded Charlie Prince, pulling a pistol from dead
     Jorgensen’s holster.

     BAM, BAM, BAM-- Wade unloads his gun, putting an end to it.


     EXT. TRAIN STATION/JAILHOUSE CABOOSE, CONTENTION - DAY

     William arrives at his father’s side, clutching his OLD
     PISTOL. He takes his father’s hand.

                          WILLIAM
               You done it, Pa. You done it. You
               put him on the train.

     Dan smiles weakly, looks his son in the eye, and releases a
     last breath. William looks up.

     As the SMOKE clears, Wade stands amidst a pile of bodies by
     the train. Bloody and beat. Wade looks at William.

     William points his PISTOL on the outlaw...

     ...and Wade just stands there.

     He even drops the SCHOFIELDS. Surrendering to his fate.

     William can shoot Wade if he wants... but he glances to his
     father. He tosses the gun and kneels beside him.

     CLOSE ON: WILLIAM glaring at Wade. Intense.

                                   3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07

     CLOSE ON: WADE. Through the pain and the blood, he turns and
     limps to the JAILHOUSE CABOOSE.

     BUTTERFIELD comes forward with A TOWN PHYSICIAN.

     The doctor tends to Dan, but there is nothing to be done.

     William watches as--

     Wade climbs up, putting himself on the train...


     EXT. JAILHOUSE CABOOSE, TRAIN STATION - DAY

     ...Wade limps into the barred JAILHOUSE CABOOSE. The old
     PRISON GUARD goes to cuff him, but Wade gives him a look.


     INT. JAILHOUSE CABOOSE, TRAIN STATION - DAY

     Wade settles inside the caboose on a bench opposite two
     THIEVES. They’re both handcuffed, gazing at him in awe...

     Wade hardly notices. His thoughts elsewhere. We see a flicker
     of emotion cross his weary face. The GUARD locks the door.

     Gives a wave to the TRAIN DRIVER.


     EXT. JAILHOUSE CABOOSE, TRAIN STATION - DAY

     The STEAM WHISTLE blows and the iron wheels begin to turn...
     ...and now we hear Wade give a WHISTLE from inside.

     CLOSE ON-- BUTTERFIELD as he notices--

     WADE’S BLACK HORSE REACTING TO THE WHISTLE. The horse trots
     after the train, past William, and the others.


     CLOSE ON-- WILLIAM

     He stands there.

     Watching the train disappear. Forever changed.

                                                     FADE OUT *
