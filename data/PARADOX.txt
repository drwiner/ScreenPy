     A GENERAL NOTE ABOUT SCENE NUMBERING

     The scene numbering in this script contains large blocks of
     “reserved” numbers for the following reason:

     Every time we travel to a different time period (except for
     the 1985 prologue), the scene numbers jump to a new 3-digit
     numb er, as follows:

     1 — 7: 1985 Prologue


     8 — 61: 2015

     201 — 238: “Biff 198"


     300 — 386: 1955


     501 — 578: 1888


     701 — 713: 1985

     This is intended to make breakdowns easi er because simply by
     looking at a scene number, you can tell what time period we
     are in.

               Jennifer! Oh, are you a sight fo r
               sore eye s! Let m e look at you!
     Marty goes to her.
     Jennifer doesn’t quite understand Marty’s reaction.

                          JENNIFER
               Marty, you’re acting like you
               haven’t seen me in a week!

                          MARTY

               Oh, yeah ! Everything is great.

     Marty and Jennifer exchange a look.

     THE DELO REAN backs out of the M cFly drivew ay and into th e
     street.


     INT. DELOREAN

     DOC engages switches and time circuits; MARTY and JENNIFER
     sit together in the passenger seat.

                          MARTY
               Doc, you’d better back up. We don’t
               have enough road to get up to 88.

               Roads? Where we’re going, we don’t
               need roads.

     Doc flips another switch.


     EXT. STREET — DELOREAN

     The wheels rotate 90 degrees, and the DMC lifts up and off
     the ground!


     EXT. MCFLY HOUSE FRONT DOOR

     BIFF, 42, comes bounding out of the McF ly house with a
     DISTINCTIVE BOOK OF MATCHES, “Biff’s Auto Detailing.”

                          BIFF
               Say, Marty, I want to show you
               these new matchbooks I had printed
               up—

     Biff stops short and reacts with astonishm ent at the sight
     of the flying car.

                          BIFF (CONT’D)
               A flying DeL orean...?

     7 BIFF reacts. His eyes narrow with suspicion. Sinister
     suspicion.

                                                           BIFF

     Thru the windshield is a STACCATO TRIPLE FLASH OF W HITE

     Doc flips on the windshield wipers — to discover they’re
     flying right into the path of an oncoming FLYING TRUCK!

     Marty and Jennifer SCREAM!

     Doc jerks the wheel, narrowly avoiding a collision.

     The angry TRUCK DRIVER sticks his head out the window.

                                                   TRUCK DRIVER

     Doc quickly holds a penlight device to Jennifer’s face which
     STROBES blue light. Jennifer imm ediately pas ses ou t.

                          MARTY

     EXT. ABOVE HILL VALLEY, 2015

     The FLYING DMC descends through the clouds.


     EXT. ALLEY — DAY

     The D eLorea n lands in a long ALL EY. It still has a b it of
     residue FRO ST on it.


     INT. DELOREAN

     Doc turns off some of the switches.

                                                            DOC
     First you’re gonna have to get out and change clothes.

                          MARTY
               Doc, it’s pouring rain.

               Right on the tick. Too bad the post
               office isn’t as efficient as the
               weather service.

     Doc and Marty throw open their gullwing doors.


     EXT. ALLEY

     As they get out of the DeLorean, Doc peels plastic material
     off his face — as if removing a disguise.

     Marty stares in disbelief.

                          DOC

               some wrinkles out, got a hair
               repair — added a good 30 to 40
               years to my life. I also had my
               spleen and colon replaced. What do
               you think?

     Doc now looks YOUNGER and healthier. He “models” his younger
     face.

                          MARTY
               You look good, Doc. Real good.

     Doc takes out a F UTUR ISTIC GYM BAG, then goes a round to
     get Jennifer out of the car. *

               back home.

                          MARTY
               Hey, I’m sorry, Doc. I’m just
               excited, that’s all. Everybody
               wants to know about their future.

               That’s what I’m afraid of.

               plan works. Change c lothes: We’ve
               got a mission to accomplish.

     As Marty starts unbuttoning his shirt, Doc lifts the
     unconscious JENNIFER out of the DeLorean and pu ts her do wn
     in a do orway alco ve behin d a futuristic waste p rocess ing
     unit.

     You mea n we’re just gonna leave her?

                          DOC (CONT’D)
               It’s too risky to take her with me.
               Don’t worry, she’ll be safe. She’s
               out of sight, and it’ll just be for
               a few minutes.
     From his po cke t, Doc pulls o ut FU TU RIS TIC BINO CU LAR S
     — a thin p lastic card with e ye lens es th at loo ks lik e a
     ch eap toy.
     Doc runs down to the opposite end of the alley and starts
     looking around for something.
     We INTER CUT Marty as he dons the future clothes:
     The shirt “buttons” with velcro.
     The ja cket se ems too big for M arty, until he touc hes a p

     Doc continues looking around intently through the binocs. At
     last he focuses on something.

     YELLOW CAP. (The binocular matte includes digital reado uts
     for dis tance, tem perature , etc.)

     14 DOC nods, satisfied. He hurries back to the DMC.
     Meanwhile, MARTY can’t figure out how to “tie” his future
     (Nike) shoes. He examines them, and touc hes a p ad. Th e

     Right. Griff’s going to ask you about tonight — are you in or
     out? Tell him you’re out. Whatever he says, whatever happens,
     say: no, you’re not interested. Then leave, come back here
     and wait for me. Don’t talk to anybody, don’t touch anything,
     don’t do anything, don’t interact with anyone.

     Doc rummages around in the DeLorean and pulls out a bag.

                                                          MARTY
     I don’t get it, Doc. I thought this has something to do with
     my kids.

     From the bag, Doc pulls a yellow cap identical to the one he
     saw a moment ago and puts it on Marty’s head.

               To intercept the real Marty Junior.
               You’re taking his place!

     Doc disappears a round the corner.

     Marty shrugs.

                          MARTY
               Marty Junior. With a name like
               that, how can he go wrong?

     He takes a deep breath and steps out of the alley onto:


     EXT. HILL VALLEY COURTHOUSE SQUARE, 2015 — DAY

     Yes, it’s COURTHOU SE SQUARE — familiar enough to recognize,
     but vastly changed...for the better:

     The streets are now GIGANTIC SIDEW ALKS, for pedestrians and
     bicycles only — no cars, which are restricted to ELEVATED
     STREE TS. (There are “No Parking” and “No Landing” signs
     posted).

     In the center, the village green has been restored and
     improved, with a DUCK POND and a FOUNTAIN.

     The renovated COURTHOUSE is now the entrance to COURTHOUSE MA
     LL, boasting over 75 underground shops; the CLOCKTOW ER has
     the same clock, cleaned up, restored, and preserved behind
     hermetically sealed plexiglass (it’s a tourist attraction)
     ...and still stopped at 10:04.

     The TEXACO STATION is now a 2-LEVEL GAS STATION. A car lands
     on the upper level and a series of ROBOT ARMS imm ediately go
     to work washing the windshield and checking the tires.

     A PLASTIC SURGER Y FRANCHISE, “Bottoms Up,” advertising FACE
     LIFTS and a sale on Breast Implants.

     A ROBO TICS SH OP displays robots and acce ssories (sales,
     service, rentals).

     Billboards for “TWA Vietnam Vacations,” “Pepsi Plus (it’s
     vitamin enriched),” and “G.E.

     Super condu ctors.”

     A HO LOG RAP HIC TH EAT ER p laying “ JAW S 14 ” (Th is tim
     e, it’s re ally, rea lly pers ona l) * directed by Max
     Spielberg.

     A VIDE O SO FTW ARE S TOR E adve rtising the “V ideo Clas
     sic: A Ma tch Ma de in Spa ce.”

     And the perennial FINANCE COMPANY offering Easy Credit: some
     things never change.

     The people in general seem in better physical condition — few
     are fat or wear glasses (although there are plenty of wild
     sunglasses and videoglasses).

     There are Kids with painted faces — a contemporary fad.

     A group of HARE-KRISHNAS are chanting in the square.

     And PU BLIC U TILIT Y W ORK ERS a re tearing u p the stree t.

     16 MARTY stares wide-eyed, taking it all in. He walks past
     17 AN ANT IQUE ST ORE in which the display window is filled
     with “RARE ANT IQUES” —

     comm on household objects of the 19 70's and 80's: a Betam
     ax, Perrier bottles, a Super-8 Movie camera, a Macintosh
     computer, mannequins with old clothes, and a BOOK: “SPORTS
     ALMAN AC 1950— 2000.” (There’s also a sign: “W e buy antique
     coins and bills.”)
     18 MARTY spots the “CAFE 80’s” located where Lou’s Malt Shop
     was in 1955.

     He goes in.


     INT . CAF E 80 ’S

                                                            19*

     Marty enters and looks around.

     The decor incorporates icons of the 1980'S (“Baby On Board”
     signs, “oldies” music, Miami Vice colors, etc.). The front
     portion is like a fast food operation. pictorial menus above
     the counter show various food items.

     There are “W atchman” type video screen s for each seat.
     Instead of waitresses, there are ROBOT/DRO IDS With VIDEO
     SCREEN heads behind the counter. The screen flashes and the
     face of RONALD REAGAN appears on it, in a “Max Headroom”
     computer synthesized image.

     W ell, the re’s a hand ling su rcha rge o n cas h, bu t,

     Marty puts the bill down on a tray on the counter. It’s
     sucked into a machine. There are some electronic sounds, some
     whirring noises, and then a PEPSI PERFECT in a futuristic
     container is dispensed via the food delivery system.

                          DROID (REAGAN)

     Two 1 -dollar bills com e out of the unit.

     Marty takes his change. He takes the Pepsi and examines it.
     He can’t figure out how to open it.

                          VOIC E (O.S .)
               Hey, M cFly!

     The voice and tone are familiar — too familiar. Marty turns.

                          MARTY
               Biff!

     Yes, it’s BIFF TANNEN, 78 years old, white hair, craggy
     features. He’s at a table, eating sushi and watching a SPORTS
     EVENT on his watchman screen. Biff gives him a look and nods
     kno wing ly.

     Marty approaches him, staring in disbelief at his aged
     features.

                                                           BIFF
     Yeah. I’ve seen you around. You’re Marty McFly’s kid, huh?

                          MARTY (CONT’D)
               Huh? W hat?

                          BIFF
               Marty Junior. You look like him,
               too. Tough break, kid: it must be
               rough being named after a complete
               butthead.

                          MARTY
               What’s that supposed to mean?

     Biff ta kes his C ANE — th e top is a sc ulpte d CL ENC HED
     FIST — a nd k noc ks it o n Ma rty’s forehead.

                          BIFF
               Hello? Anybody home? Think, McFly,
               think! Your old man: Mr. Loser.

                          MARTY
               W hat? A loser?

                          BIFF
               That’s rig ht. A loser w ith a
               capital “L.”

                          MARTY
               That can’t be! I happen to know
               that George McFly is no longer a
               loser.

     Outside, through the window, a beat up ‘89 BMW Convertible
     Hover conversion pulls up to the cafe with 4 GU YS in it. The
     vehicle pa rks an d the guys get out.

                          BIFF
               No, George McFly’s never been a
               loser. But I’m not talking abo ut
               Ge orge McF ly. I’m ta lking abou t
               his k id — your o ld man: Ma rty
               McFly. Senior.
                    (a beat as Biff shakes his
                     head)
               He jus t took his life a nd flush
               ed it com pletely down the toilet.

     Marty stands there in stunned shock.

                          MARTY
               M-m -m e? M arty?

     Now a KID, 19, who bears a startling resemblance to Biff,
     steps in.

                          KID
               Hey, Gramps, I told you two coats
               of wax on my car, not just one.

                          BIFF
               Hey, I just put the 2nd coat on
               last week.

                          KID
               Yeah, with your eyes closed. Come
               out here and scan it. It’s a lo-res
               job.

     Marty look s back and forth betwee n the two in ama zeme nt.

                          MARTY
               Uh, are you two related?

     Again Biff knocks on Marty’s head with his cane.

                          BIFF
               Hello? Anybody home? Whaddaya
               think, Griff just calls me grandpa
               for his health.

     Marty looks at Biff’s grandson with an “oh shit” reaction.

                          MARTY
               He’s Griff...?!?

                          GRIFF
               Gramps, nuke the bab-sesh and get
               out here, ‘orrita! What the hell am
               I payin’ you for?
                    (to M arty)
               And M cFly: don’t go anywher e.
               You’re n ext!

     Biff heads for the door.

                                                           BIFF
     Liste n, Gr iff, do n’t you go loa nin’ th at Mc Fly kid any
     m one y — even though he probably needs it...him and his old
     man both.

     Biff exits, leaving Marty dumbfounded.

     Marty watches through the window as Griff points out to Biff
     some problem with the finish on his beat up junker. Also
     present are Griff’s gang, a girl and 2 guys: SPIKE, WHITEY
     and HACK.

     On a V IDEO SCR EEN, a Rock Video “O ldie” com es on: “P ower
     of Love.”

     Marty wa tches a nd nod s to the be at.

     3 nearby GIRLS, about 13, shake their heads.

                          GIRL #1
               Oh, shred that! I only scan that
               kinda vid at my grandma’s!

                          GIRL #2
               Yeah , wha t do th ey call it? Roc
               k an d rail?

                          GIRL #3
               It doesn’t even sound like music!

                          GIRL #1
               Yeah, thank God we didn’t have to
               live in the 80’s. It must have been
               terrible.

     Marty feels very old.

     Nearby is an ARCA DE VIDEO GAME from the 80’s: “GUN FIGHT
     ER.” It’s one of those where you shoo t a light gun at th e
     video s creen. A KID, abo ut 8. is lookin g at it. He ca n’t
     figure it out.

                          KID
               How do you play this thing?

                          MARTY
               I’ll show you, kid. I’m a crack
               shot at this one. Where do you put
               in the quarter?

                          KID
               Quarter? W hat’s a quarter?

     Marty touches his thumb to a thumbplate where the money would
     normally go and the game starts up. So that’s how you “u se
     your thu mb.”

     Marty zaps every targe t, no swe at. He’s a c rack s hot.

                                                            KID
     You mean you have to use your hands? That’s like a baby toy!

     Marty really feels old.

     Marty takes a few more shots, the REAL MAR TY J UN IOR pass
     es by o ut the wind ow, o n his way into the cafe. He’s
     unnoticed by Griff, Biff and the boys, who are absorbed in
     the car.

     MARTY sees him coming. He’s horrified.

                          MARTY
               Damn!

     Marty runs behind the counter and ducks down, hiding.

     JUNIOR enters.

     Marty gets a good look at his future son.

     JUNIOR, 17, although dressed like Marty, carries himself
     quite differently. In a word, he’s a me ss: h is jac ket d
     oes n’t fit rig ht (the uni-fit syste m is brok en), h e has
     food stain s all ov er him , and unkempt hair sticks out of
     his yellow cap. He’s a combination of Marty’s looks with the
     pers ona lity of you ng G eorg e Mc Fly.

                          DROID (REAGAN)
               Welcome to Cafe 80’s where it’s
               always—

                          JUNIOR
               Pepsi P erfect.

     Junior pays for it by putting his thumb to a thum bplate
     device on the counter, and the delivery unit d ispe nse s a P
     eps i.

     Now GR IFF and the GU YS enter.

                          GRIFF
               Hey, M cFly!

     Jun ior tur ns an d sm iles w eak ly.

                          JUNIOR
               Hi, Griff; guys. How’s it going?

                                                          GRIFF
     Hey, McFly, your shoe’s unvelked.

     Junior falls for it; Griff slaps him and he and his boys all
     laugh. Junior laughs, too.

     Marty winces at the humiliation.

                          GRIFF
               So, M cFly, h ave yo u m ade your d
               ecis ion ab out... t onigh t’s
               little op portu nity?

     Marty reacts with increased concern.

                          JUNIOR
               Uh, we ll, I’m still not sure. S
               eem s kinda dange rous...

               W hat’s it gonn a be M cFly? You in
               or out?

                          JUNIOR
               Well... I don’t really think I
               should, but I guess I should
               discuss it with my fath—

                          GRIFF
               Are yo u sayin g “no ,” Mc Fly?

                          JUNIOR
               Uh, we ll, yes. That is, I’m
               saying, “no, th ank you .”

     Marty sighs relief.

                          GRIFF
               W rong answ er, M cFly.

     As he says it, Griff picks up Marty Junior and THROWS H IM
     OVER THE CO UNTER right next to where Marty is hiding!

     The guys all laugh.

     Some of the patrons react with concern; some make phone calls
     on their wrist or headgear phones to 911.

                          DROID (REAGAN)
               Now, now, let’s behave ourselves.

     MARTY stares at his unconscious future son, lying there.

     Marty takes a deep breath and stands up. Griff grabs him by
     the jacket and pulls him over the counter.

                          GRIFF
               Now, let’s hear the right answe r,
               or you’re go nna ge t a knuc kle
               brioch e...

     Marty shoves Griff, and clenches a fist, about to throw a
     punch.

     Griff and the guys react with surprise at such unusua l
     behavior for Marty Junior.

                          GRIFF (CONT’D)
               Well, well, well, since when did
               you become the physical type?

     Marty rem emb ers who he’s sup posed to be and unclenc hes
     his fis t.

                          MARTY
               Look , Griff, the an swer’s “n o.”

                          GRIFF
               No?

                          MARTY
               N-O.

     Marty turns around and starts for the door.

                          GRIFF
               What’s wrong, McFly? Chicken?

     Marty stops just before he reaches the door. His body tenses,
     his face tightens, his anger rises...

                          SPIKE
               I told you he’s g ot no sc roat.

                          >HACK
                    (pulls Marty’s yellow hat
                     off)
               Sure, why’dya think he wears
               yellow?

     Marty is seething.

                                                          MARTY
     W hat did you call me, Griff?

                          GRIFF
               Chic ken , McF ly!

     Griff and the guys make “clucking” sounds.

     Marty turns around with resolve.

                          MARTY
               Nobody calls me chicken!

     Griff pick s up a plate from the ta ble an d hur ls it at M
     arty. M arty do dge s it; G riff ch arge s him ; then Marty
     trips Griff!

     Griff falls to the floor.

     The re’s a mo me nt of s tunn ed sile nce from Griff ’s boys
     . This is clea rly unc hara cteris tic behavior for Marty
     Junior.

     Griff gets back o n his feet a nd rises in front of M arty,
     slowly stand ing to his full he ight.

                          GRIFF
               All right, punk, you’ve been
               looking for—

                          MARTY
               Hey — look!

     Griff falls fo r it and turns , and M arty throws a punc h...
     but Griff ra ises his a rm an d block s it.

     A beat, then Marty knees him in the groin!

     Griff wails in pain and drops to his knees.

     Marty runs for it, ramming into Griff’s gang, who fall down
     like dominoes!

     Marty bolts out of the cafe.

     EXT. CAFE 80’S — DAY

     Marty runs past Biff, who is doing some work on Griff’s car.


     26 MARTY SPOTS TW O GIRLS BEHIND THE HEDGE, APPARENTLY ON
     KIDDIE SKATEBOARD-SCOOTERS.

                          MARTY
               Hey, kid, I need your—

     Marty stops short as he examines the pink board: there’s a
     loop strap for one foot but it has NO W HEELS!

     Its brand name: “(-----) HOVERBOAR D!”

                          MARTY (CONT’D)
               Hoverboard?

     He throws it down and it hovers a few inches above the
     ground!

                          MARTY (CONT’D)
               All right!

     Marty hops on it and kicks it up to speed: it functions just
     like a skateboard! He glides diagonally into the square,
     along the path that juts out into the pond.


     26-A EXT. CAFE

                                                          26-A*

     Now GRIFF and the GANG com e running out of the cafe.

     They spot Marty hoverboarding out toward the pond.

                                                          GRIFF
     There he is! Hey, McFly! You’re a dead file!

     Marty looks back at them and just smiles, confident that he’s
     escaped.


     27 BIFF WATCHING, SCRATCHES HIS HEAD AS MEMORIES RETURN.

                          BIFF
               There ’s som ething fam iliar about
               all this...


     EXT. TOWN SQUARE

     Griff and the guys run to Griff’s BMW and pull 4 HOVERBOA RDS
     from the back seat: wicked looking models that look a whole
     lot faster than Marty’s!

     Marty quits gloating an d gets m oving! T he path h e’s on en
     ds as a n island in the pond: M arty * cuts sideways and
     continues O VER the water toward the C OURT HOUS E — but the
     board

     slows... then stops.

     He’s stalle d abo ve the pond , 15 fe et fro m th e edg e! M
     arty loo ks b ehind him .

                          HACK
               McFly, you bojo, those boards don’t
               work on water — unless you’ve got
               power!

     Griff pulls o ut the MEA NES T LO OK ING HO VER BO ARD in
     exis tenc e: TH E PIT BUL L! it’s powered with 2 jets, it’s
     got fins, and has spikes around it — it resembles a chain
     saw!

     Griff throws it down. It hums and hovers to life with an
     electronic GROWL!

     Griff hops on it and does the hoverboard version of a
     wheelie, just to show off how skilled he is.

     Marty reacts with fear. He tries to kick off the water. He
     almost falls off — it’s like balancing on a log.

     Griff smiles sadistically at the helpless Marty. Now Spike,
     Wh itey and Hack fall in behind Griff.

                                                          GRIFF
     Hook on.

     The guys pull tow lines out from the back of Griff’s board.

     Griff whips out a collapsible BASEBALL BAT.

                          GRIFF
               I’m gonna take his hea d off!

     Griff kick s his f oot a gains t the e ngine . He a cce

     Aga in, Ma rty tries to pa ddle w ith his foot, t o no a

     Griff raises the bat and takes a batter’s stance.

     The guys fan out behind Griff, cackling sadistically. Marty,
     panicked, turns and sees Griff and the g uys be aring dow n
     on h im!

     Griff goe s into his ba cksw ing...

     Marty is pe trified...

     Griff star ts his swin g...

     Then Marty pulls his foot from the strap, and simply STEPS
     OFF THE HOVERBOARD, AND DROPS INTO THE POND!

     As Marty’s head hits the water, Griff’s board whizzes across,
     missing him by millimeters!

     Griff can’t stop his swing — he loses his balance in his
     follow-thru, causing himself and the guys to go flying wildly
     and completely out of control at the Courthouse!

     2 guys are knocked into columns, one goes through the door,
     and another through a window!

     ALARM S go off!

     Marty comes up from underwater as the 3 empty hoverboards of
     Griff’s guys drop to a hover nea rby.

     UNIFORMED SECURITY GUAR DS come rushing out of the Courthouse
     to apprehend the punks.

     Marty sighs in relief at his escape. He paddles ashore with
     the little girl’s pink board.

     He climbs out and spots the little girl and hands back her
     board.

                          MARTY
               Thanks a lot, kid.

                          LITTLE GIRL
               Keep it. I’ve got a Pit Bull now!

     Indeed , she has Griff’s bo ard and she ho vers aw ay on it.

     EXT. TOW N SQUARE — DAY

     MARTY sighs in relief at his escape.

     He tucks the hoverboard under his arm and starts walking back
     across the square toward the alley.

     Behind him, a MAN is walking around with a portable THUMB UN
     IT, soliciting.

                          MAN

               I said, I sure wish I could go back
               in time and put money on the Cubs.

     Marty’s face lights up with a great idea.

                                                          MARTY
     Yeah!

     Marty looks toward the ANTIQUE STORE.

                                                        CUT TO:

     Marty opens the bag and takes out the Sports Almanac.

     He smiles and looks back at OLD BIFF, who is still polishing
     Griff’s BMW.

     again at Marty Junior, who hurries off in anot her d irectio

               Hey, did it just say her birthday
               was 1968? She’s got one helluva
               job! Wonder who her doctor is. My
               mother-in-law could use a lift like
               this.

                          REESE
               She couldn’t afford work like that.
               Well, she’s clean; that means we
               take her home.
     They carry her to their vehicle.

     34 MART Y watches in horror as the Police Vehicle takes off
     with Jenn ifer.

                          MARTY
               Oh, no!
     Marty runs back into town square.

                          DOC (O.S.)
               Marty! Over here!
     Marty turns and spots Doc coming around the corner by the
     Cafe 80’s. He has a NEW SPAPER (USA TOD AY — Hill Valley
     Edition). Doc is now in 1985 clothes.

                          MARTY
               Doc! W e’re in seriou s shit!

                          DOC
               I know! My plan failed! Marty, what
               went wrong in there?
     Doc points to the Cafe.

                          MARTY
               In there? Well, for one thing, the
               real Marty Junior showed up.

                          DOC
               Great Scott! The s leep inducer!
               Because I used it on Jennifer,
               there wasn’t enough power left to
               knock your son out for the full 20
               minutes. Damn!

                                                          MARTY
     Doc, besides that — Oh my God!
     Marty has noticed the newspaper which Doc is holding. Marty
     grabs it and reads.


     35 INSERT — NEW SPAPER
     “LOCAL YOUTH JAILED IN ATTEMPTED THEFT,” accompanied by a
     photo of MARTY JUNIOR.

     Below that, “Youth Gang Denies complicity,” with picture of

     Marty takes another look at the newspaper; this time, his
     eyes nearly bug out of his head.

                          MARTY (CONT’D)

     Marty Jun ior. There ’s also a pic ture of so me p roperty

     Suddenly, Doc has a revelation.

                          DOC
               Of c ours e! T he rip ple ef fect!
               Tim e trav el into the fu ture is
               always the extrapo lation of cur
               rent even ts of the im med iate
               presen t. In my ca se, I left this
               tim e at a m ome nt before this
               hoverboard incident took place —
               yet I returned after it occurred.
               Just as the presen t affects the
               future, the future reverbe rates ba
               ck into the past.
               And because this hoverboard
               incident has now occu rred, Griff
               now goes to jail: therefore, your
               son won’t go with him tonight and
               this robbery will never take place!
               And that’s why the newspaper is now
               altered.

                                                          MARTY

     Precisely! Marty, we’ve succeeded! Not exactly as I planned,
     but no matter: mission accomplished! Let’s get Jennifer and
     go home.

     DELOREAN descending.

                          BIFF
               A flying DeL orean? I haven’t se en
               one of those in 30 years...

     Suddenly, Biff’s face lights with recognition — as he
     realizes that he’s seen it before. His eyes * narrow with
     suspicion.


     EXT. TOWN SQUARE — DOC AND MARTY

     Doc continues piloting with the wrist remote. Once the DMC
     lands, Doc uses the FUTABA REMOTE C ONTRO L UNIT (from Twin
     Pines Mall) to drive the car over to them.

                                                          MARTY

               Jennifer actually encounters her
               future self, the consequences could

               The shock of coming face to face
               with oneself 30 years older is
               enoug h to traum atize anyone . She

               her heart could stop, she could
               drop dead and that would create a
               time parado x which would unravel
               the very fabric of the space-time
               continuum and destroy the entire
               Universe.

     Foley rings the doorbell. No answer.

                          FOLEY
               They’ve got identi-pad. We could

                     face)
               Miss? Miss?

     Jennifer starts to revive. She’s groggy and disoriented.

                          JENNIFER
               Uhhh ...where a m I?

     Foley takes her hand and pushes her thumb to the ident-plate
     below the doorbell. The door opens.

     The cops help her inside.


     INT. LIVING ROOM

     They enter the darkened room.

     In response to her words, LIGHTS automatically come on!

     The room is furnished mostly with a lot of (old) items from
     the late ‘80s or early ‘90s — but there are s om e m ore ra
     dica l obje cts a s we ll.

     The police put Jennifer down on the sofa. She’s still not all
     here.

                          REESE
               Just take it easy and you’ll be

                          JENNIFER
               The fu ture...?

     The cops he ad for the door.

                          FOLEY
               So lo ng, M rs. M cFly.

                          JENNIFER
               So long.

     They exit and the door automatically closes behind them.

     Suddenly, Jennifer sits up in disbelief.

                          JENNIFER (CONT’D)
               Mrs. McFly?!?

     She looks around the room.

     There’s a window, showing the grounds of a large estate
     outside — manicured lawn, gardens, gazebo... The image seems
     a bit surreal because it’s DAYTIME.

     STAIRS go up.

     Jennifer goes to a bookcase and browses. On the shelf are a
     row of VID-BOOKS (a format yet to be invented). There is a
     prerecorded copy of “A MATCH MADE IN SPACE .” The other
     titles are handwritten and include:
     “W edding — Jennife r & Mar ty.”
     “Fam ily Vacations — 19 95— 2005.”
     “Ge orge & Lo rrain e 50t h An niver sary”
     “The K ids: Marty, Jr . & Marle ne — Vol. 1, 2, 3.”

     She takes the one labeled “wedding” and opens it. Inside the
     cover is an LCD screen which starts playing back video tape
     of Marty and Jennifer walking down the aisle.

                          JENNIFER (CONT’D)
               Oh my God!

     In response, a GIRL’S VOICE calls down from upstairs.

                          MAR LENE (O.S.)
               Mom? Is that you?

     The voice sounds EXACTLY LIKE JENNIFER’S!

     Jennifer reacts with alarm.

                          >JENNIFER
                    (to herself)
               I’ve gotta get out of here!

     Jen nifer quick ly puts the vid -boo k ba ck o n the shelf
     and r uns for th e fro nt do or. Sh e can ’t figure out how
     to open it — there’s no door knob.

     Suddenly, the DOORBELL RINGS.

                          MAR LENE (O.S.)
               Mom? Mom?

     Jennifer hides in the front closet and closes the louvered
     door. She can see out of it. Her jaw drops and her eyes go
     wide as she sees:

     MAR LENE McF LY, 17, wh o looks like...

     Well, if Marty was a girl, this might be her. Big breasts,
     and somewhat chunky, she looks like she overdid it on the
     weight training. (She does have her mother’s hair, though!)

     Marlene pushes the thumb pad by the front door: it opens.

     of the activity at the front door: OLD LORRAINE, 77, has a
     bag/package of future take-out food.

     Marlene takes the food from Lorraine and goes to the kitchen.

               Look, this window’s still broken.

     Lorraine picks u p a rem ote con trol unit and o perates it.

     The window image changes to the SOUTH SEAS, then to the SWISS
     ALPS; then to NEW YORK CITY at night. Finally the image goes
     off, and the REAL window view appears — the side of the
     neighbor’s townhouse with garbage cans.

     JENNIFE R cautiously opens the closet door.

                          OLD LORRAINE
               No, George, Marty would take that
               as an insult. He’d think you were
               reminding him that he can ’t afford
               it.

                          OLD GEORGE
               I just want to help out.

                          OLD LORRAINE
               Well, you know Marty. He’s always
               so overly concerned about what
               people think about him, what they
               say about him behind his back. How
               many times have we heard it: “Mom,
               I can’t let ‘em thin k I’m c heap.
               I ca n’t let ’em think I’m not w

                          OLD GEORGE
               “I can’t let ‘em think I’m
               chicken?”

     They exchange a look.

     Jennifer spots FRENCH DO ORS in the DEN at the opposite end
     of the house. She steps out of the closet and cautiously
     creeps that way, being careful to stay out of view of
     Lorraine and George.

                          OLD LORRAINE
               George, that accident with the
               Rolls Royce was 30 years ago.

                          OLD GEORGE
               And Marty hasn’t learned a thing.
               He still won’t admit that the who
               le thin g wa s his o wn fa ult. If
               M arty ha d jus t use d a little
               common sense, that accident would
               have never happened. That accident
               started a chain reaction that sent
               Marty’s life straight do wn the
               toilet.

                          OLD LORRAINE
               You’re right. The man in that Roll
               Royce wouldn’t have pres sed char

                          OLD GEORGE
               And Marty wouldn’t have spent all
               those years feeling sorry for
               himself, complaining how life gave
               him such a raw deal. He just gave
               up.

                                                   OLD LORRAINE
     You’r e righ t, Ge orge . If not for th at ac cide nt, M arty

     Now MARTY JUN IOR comes running down the stairs.

     Jennifer tenses, concerned — she’s right out in the open!

     Junior runs right past her, not even looking at her.

                                                         JUNIOR
     H i, Mo m .

     Junior goes into the Den.

               the house, King of the castle, Lord
               of the manor.

     Jennifer reacts with a “you gotta be kidding” expression.
     Then, realizing she’s still out in the open, she darts thru
     an open door into the BATHROOM.

     She close s the door , leavin g it ope n eno ugh to pe ek o

               Hi, everybody, I’m home! Aw, Dad,
               you threw your back out again. I
               really think you should get that
               spine operation.

                          OLD GEORGE
               I know, I know, but who’s got 3
               extra hours to spend at the hos
               pital?

                          OLD LORRAINE
               How are th ings at wo rk, M arty?

                          OLD MARTY
               Oh, same old, same old.

     JENNIFER notices another door in the bathroom. She looks
     through it and sees the DEN where MARTY JUNIOR is watching 8
     DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AT ONCE on a LARGE VID EO W ALL SCR EEN —
     w hich sits s lightly c rook ed on the w all.

                                                      OLD MARTY
     Junior, dinner time.

                          MARTY JUNIOR
               But I’m watching TV!

                          OLD MARTY
               Well, get your glasses. We eat at
               the table when your grandparents
               are here.

                                                   MARTY JUNIOR
     Aw, Dad, I can only watch 2 shows at once on my glasses!

     Old Marty straightens out the tilted screen.

                                                      OLD MARTY
     Yeah, you kids really have it tough. When I was your age, if
     I wanted to watch 2 show s at onc e, I had to p ut 2 sets n

     INT. TOWNHOUSE — NIGHT

     The McFly family minus old Jennifer is at the dinner table.

     Old Lorraine puts a little 4-inch PIZZA HUT box into a
     “Hydrator” and pushes a button.

                          OLD LORRAINE
               ...so I t hou ght it w ould b e
               nice if we th rew a little pa rty
               for h im.

     The Hydrator beeps; Lorraine opens it and pulls out a
     beautiful steaming 15-inch pizza.

                          OLD MARTY
               Mom, before we plan a party for
               Uncle Joey, let’s see if be makes
               parole.

     Old Lorraine serves the pizza.

     Marty Junior and Marlene are both wearing video glasses. The
     glasses are opaque from the outside, with LCD readouts
     showing what channel the viewer is watching.

     Junior’s re adout s ays “ESP N — Ch 211 -D.” It’s a foo tball
     gam e, and Ju nior reac ts to. it, YELLING “Fumble! I can’t
     believe it! Take him outta the game!” etc.

                          OLD LORRAINE
               George, rotate your axis, please.
               It’s not good for your digestion to
               eat while you’re inverted.

     Old George pushes a control on his harness which turns him
     right side up.

     JENNIFER, who can see the family from the bathroom, goes
     through the 2nd bathroom door into the den, and creeps toward
     the French Doors.

                          OLD MARTY
               Pass me a slice of the kelp,
               please.

                          MARLENE
               No, I don’t want to, so nump off!

     Marlene’s glasses display says “Telephone mode.” Now Old
     Marty’s beeper goes off. Red lights also flash on the kids’
     glasses.

                          KIDS
                    (in unison)
               Dad! Telephone!! It’s Needles.

     Old Marty checks his beeper, then gets up.

                          OLD MARTY
               I’ll take it in the den.

     He pauses at a mirror and adjusts his tie and checks his
     hair, then goes into the den.

     Immediately, Jennifer has to go back into the bathroom.

     OLD M ARTY EN TERS a nd pushes a rem ote controller.

     The 8 image display is reduced to a small corner of the
     screen as the image of NEEDLES, 47, appears in the center, at
     an office work station. To the side a computer readout with
     his vital and personal statistics. It’s video telephone.

                                                NEEDLES (VIDEO)

     EXT. AT THE DELOREAN

     MARTY, now back in his 1985 clothes, impatiently looks in the
     direction Doc went. Should he take a c loser look or not?

     Yeah. He quietly follows, leaving the DeLorean unattended and
     out of his view.

     Old Marty continues his conversation with Needles while
     Jennifer watches from the bathroom.

                          NEEDLES (VIDEO)
               McF ly, wha t are yo u afr aid of ?
               If this thing work s, it’ll so lve
               all your financial problems.

                          OLD MARTY
               And if it doesn’t work, I could get
               fired. It’s illegal, Needles. What
               if “the Jits” is monitoring?

                          NEEDLES (VIDEO)
               “The Jits’ll” never find out. Come
               on, just stick your card in the
               slot and I’ll handle it. Unless you
               want everyone in the division to
               think you’re... chicken.

     Marty’s blood rises. He tenses up.

                                                      OLD MARTY
     Nobody calls me chicken!

                          NEEDLES (VIDEO) (CONT’D)
               All right, prove it.

     Marty def iantly takes o ut a CA RD w ith BAR C ODE S and h
     olds it up for Need les to see . Marty * then inserts it in a
     slot next to the screen.

                          OLD MARTY
               Here. Scan it! I’m in.

     We hear an ELECTR ONIC TONE, then Marty withdraws the card.

                          NEEDLES
               Thanks, McFly. See you at the plant
               tomorrow.

     The screen blanks. As Marty turns to leave the room, there
     are some electronic tones and a new image breaks in on the
     conversation: MR. FUJITSU, a Japanese man in his early 30's.

                          FUJITSU (VIDEO)
               McFly!!

     Marty turns — he’s surprised and concerned.

                          OLD MARTY
               Mr. Fujitsu, sir! Good evening,
               sir!

                          FUJITSU (VIDEO)
               McF ly, I was monitoring that scan
               you just interfaced. You’re
               terminated.

                          OLD MARTY
               Term inated? B ut sir! It was n’t
               my idea ! Need les was behind it!

                          FUJITSU (VIDEO)
               And you cooperated. It was illegal
               and you knew it. You’re fired,
               McFly. Goodbye.

                          OLD MARTY
               But, sir—

                          FUJITSU (VIDEO)
               McFly: Read my fax!

     The s creen s udden ly goes to a g iant display of a piece of
     c omp any stationa ry, addres sed to Marty, which says in big
     block letters, “YOU’RE FIRED!

     Simultaneously, a copy comes out of the FAX UNIT in Marty’s
     den!

     An id entic al cop y com es ou t in the Fax ma chin e in the
     bath room ! (T here ’s a fa x m ach ine in every room .)
     Jennife r pulls it out and looks a t it in amaze men t.

     Fujitsu “hangs up.” His image disappears and a “painting”
     appears: the “Art Channel” (which broadcasts ever chan ging
     images of fam ous paintings).

     Old Marty stares at his copy of the fax in disbelief.

                          VOIC E (O.S .)
                    (whispers)
               Jennifer!!

     Startled, Jennifer shoves the fax in her pocket and turns:
     DOC BROWN is in the bathroom window.
     (In the back grou nd, w e can see O ld Lor raine also p
     ulling a copy o f the s am e fax from the u nit in the kitch

                          DOC
               Go out the front door! I’ll meet
               you there!

                          JENNIFER
               It won’t open!

                          DOC
               Push your thumb to the plate!

     She nods, then creeps out the first door, keeping low as she
     goes toward the front doo r.

                                                   OLD LORRAINE
     Marty, what’s the meaning of this fax?

                                                      OLD MARTY
     Believe me, Mom, it wasn’t my fault. I just always seem to
     get a raw deal on everything.

     Jennifer makes it to the front door. Next to it is another
     fax machine in which is another copy of the “You’re Fired”
     notice.

     Jennifer is about to put her thumb to the thumb plate.

                          COM PU-V OICE (V.O.)
               W elcome hom e, Jennifer.

     The door opens and Jennifer FINDS HERSELF FACE TO FACE WITH
     HER OLDER SELF!

     Young Jennifer’s eyes widen, her jaw drops and she gasps at
     her future appearance:

     At 47, the years have not been kind; booze has taken its
     toll, too. Puffy, wrinkled, circles under the eyes, she
     reminds us of Lorraine at the beginning of part one.

                          JENNIFER
               Oh, God, I’m OLD!

     Young Jennife r’s eyes glaze over, her b reathing s hortens
     ...

     Old Jen nifer reac ts identically...

     Then both of then simultaneously keel over forward in a
     faint: Young Jennifer falling out the door, to the outside,
     Old Jennifer falling into the house.

     DOC BRO WN runs up just in time to catch the young Jennifer.
     He drags her out, and the front door automatically closes.

     CAMERA m oves across the unconscious Old Jennifer. Then a
     pair of feet arrive: OLD MART Y. As he exam ines his wife,
     MARLEN E and JUN IOR also com e over.

                                                      OLD MARTY
     Looks like your mother’s tranked again.
     56 EXT. McFLY TOWNHOUSE — NIGHT

     Doc carries the uncons cious Jennifer.

                          DOC
               Marty! Come quick!

     Marty runs up and helps Doc carry Jennifer. They can’t yet
     see that the DELOREAN IS GONE.

                          MARTY
               Is she alive?

                          DOC
               She’s in shock, as I predicted, but
               otherwise she seems unhurt. L et’s
               get he r back to 1985, a nd then
               I’m going to destroy the time

               The risks are just too great — as
               this incident proves. And I was

     Now the DELOREAN pulls into the same parking place. The
     gullwing door opens and OLD BIFF climbs out. He has a BRUISE
     on his forehead. He grabs his cane — it’s stuck. He yanks, we
     hear a “SNAP” and he frees it. He hobbles away, OUT OF FRAME.

     Doc and M arty now approach with Jennifer.

                          DOC (CONT’D)
               No, M arty, time trav eling is too

               great mystery of the Universe:
               women.

                          MARTY
               Doc, if you can solve that one, let
               me know.

     The DeLo rean pulls out, then its wheels drop down into the

     OLD BIFF sees it go, then he clutches his chest in pain and

     They put her in the hammock. Jennifer remains asleep.

     Marty looks at the house curiously, as if something’s wrong.
     There are SECURITY BARS on all the windows.

                                                          MARTY

     Jeez, something really stinks!

     Doc sniffs and makes a face.

     EXT. LION GATES OF LYON ESTATES — NIGHT

     The DMC drives through the familiar Lions gates. The street
     is strewn with trash — more than usu al.


     EXT. MCFLY HOME — NIGHT

     Marty gets out of the DeLorean.

                          DOC

               Or a nightmare.

     Doc drives off.

     Marty cocks his head — it sounds like there’s GUNFIRE in the
     distance.

     He walks up to the front door. It’s locked.

     He takes out his door key and tries to open it — but the key
     won’t fit. Marty fiddles with it, to no avail.

                          MARTY (CONT’D)
               W hat th e hell?

     He sh rugs, the n goes around to the side o f the hou se. Th

     Immediately, he’s greeted by a SCREAM!


     INT. BEDROOM

     Marty has fallen into a BED with a 12 YEAR OLD BLACK GIRL!
     She keeps SCREAMING!

     Marty is shocked!

                          GIRL
               MOMMA ! DAD! HELP!!!

                                                          MARTY
     Hey, who are you? W hat are d oing in m y—roo m...?

     Marty suddenly realizes that this is NOT HIS ROOM.
     Everything’s different — it’s a girl’s room.

                          GIRL (CONT’D)
               HELP!!! Daddy, help!!!

     She starts throwing things at a totally confused Marty. Now
     the door bursts open and her PARENTS rush in: DAD has a
     BASEBALL BAT! W ith them is HAROLD, aged 7.

                          DAD
               Freeze, sucker!

     Marty is terrified! He raises his hands.

                          MARTY
               Okay, take it easy. I don’t want
               any trouble.

                          DAD
               Well, you got trouble now, you no
               good trash! What are you doing in
               here with my daughter?

                          MARTY
               Nothing! It’s all a mistake! I’m in
               the wrong house!

                                                         HAROLD
     Whoop him, Dad! He’s lying!

                          DAD
               Shut up, Harold.
                    (to his daughter)
               Loretta — did he touch you?

                          GIRL
               He jumped on me!

                                                          MARTY

                                                            DAD
     Damn right, you made a mistake!

     He s wing s the bat a t Mar ty!

     Marty dodges and Dad’s swing destroys some of his daughter’s
     possessions!

                                                           GIRL
     Dad, stop! You’re breakin’ m y stuff!

     Dad takes another swing: He again misses Marty and takes out
     more of Loretta’s things!

     Loretta starts hitting her father.

     Marty runs out of the room.


     EXT. FRONT OF THE HO USE

     Marty runs out the front door. He pauses at the street to
     look at the house. It sure seems like his house.

     Sud den ly, DAD com es ou t bran dish ing th e bat , his F AM
     ILY b ehind him .

     Marty starts running.

                                                            DAD

     212-A

     MARTY walks along, confused.

     A car dr ives by, full of SC REAM ING K IDS thro wing bee r
     bottles into th e street.

                                                          MARTY
     It’s gotta be the wrong year.

     Marty notices that the house he’s in front of has a NEWSPAPER
     on the PORCH.


     EXT. ON THE PORCH

     Marty runs up on the porch, picks up the paper and opens it.
     He checks the date.
     214 INSERT — NEWSPAPER (HILL VALLEY TELEGRAPH)

     The d ate is “Satu rday, Oc tober 26 , 1985.”
     215 MARTY is stunned.

     215*

                          MARTY
               1985? It can’t be!

     There’s an offscreen sound of a PUMP SHOTGU N COCKING, and a
     gun barrel is shoved against Marty’s head.

                          MAN (O.S.)
               So you’re the son of a bitch who’s
               been stealing my newspapers!

     The voice is familiar. Marty turns and finds himself facing

                          MARTY
               MR. STRICKLAND!

     Yes, it’s STRICKLAND, and he looks even meaner than we
     remember, particularly because of a large, ugly KNIFE SCAR
     across his face. He’s wearing a FLAK JACKET over his
     bathrobe.

     Strickland looks at him without recognition.

                                                     STRICKLAND
     Do I know you?

               Yes, sir, it’s m e, Ma rty! M arty

                                                     STRICKLAND
     Who?

     Last week? Now I know you’re lying. There hasn’t been a High
     School in Hill Valley for 6 years!

     On Marty’s astonished reaction, we

                                                        CUT TO:

                          MARTY (CONT’D)
               This is nuts.

     He shakes his head, then walks on, staggered. We hold on the
     burned out school, then we

                                                        CUT TO:
     216 MARTY on the run again as he now arrives at


     EXT. COURTHOUSE SQUARE — NIGHT

     The sign, “Hill Valley — A Nice Place to Live” is riddled
     with bullet holes.

     Marty step s past it and becom es even more shock ed as h e
     discov ers...

     The Courthouse has been converted into a GIGANTIC LAS VEGAS
     STYLE HIGH RISE HO TEL CO MP LEX ! It’s g arish , over don e,
     ou trage ous , and it’s ca lled “B IFF T ANN EN’S PLEASURE

     flashing lit sign includ es an anim ated POR TR AIT OF BIFF
     lighting a ciga r with a $100 bill!

     The place is doing tremendous business. MARTY is dumbfounded.

     BIKERS rev their Harleys and drag up and down the streets.

     In the dista nce , large IND UST RIA L SM OK EST ACK S sp ew
     th ick p ollutio n into the n ight s ky.

     Marty sees that the whole square is now a sleazy nightmare of
     BARS, ADULT BOOK STORES, PAWN SHOPS, BAIL BONDSMEN and PORNO
     THEATERS.

     TW O BOU NCER S, who we m ay recognize as 2 of Biff’s boys
     from 1955, MA TCH an d 3-D (who now wears garish jeweled 3-D
     glasses), are throwing a young MAN out of the Paradise Hote
     l.

                          3-D
               And don’t ever come beggin’ for
               drinks in here again! Friggin’

     The d runke n fellow pick s hims elf up off th e pavem ent.

                          DRUNK
               Hey, can’t you guys take a joke?

     Marty rea cts: there ’s som ething VE RY fam iliar about this
     c haracte r...

     The drunk pulls a pint bottle out of his ragged coat, drains
     what’s left in it, and throws it at the hote l.

     Marty gasps as he realizes who it is:

     DAVE McFLY, 22, his own brother! Red nose, puffy face, Dave
     is really plastered.

                          MARTY
               Dave!

                          DAVE
               Marty! Hey, bro, what’s happening!
               Hey, you’re lookin’ kinda ragged
               there — what, did you sleep in your
               clothes again last night?

                          MARTY
               Dave, m y God, wh at’s happ ened to
               yo u? W hat’s hap pened to the

                                                           DAVE
     Oh, all this? It’s the Biker’s Convention. So, Marty, when’d
     you get back?

                          MARTY (CONT’D)
               Back? Back from where?

                                                           DAVE

     |Well, if you don’t know, how do you expect me to tell you?
     (laug hs lou dly; the n con spira torially)
     Hey, let’s go have a few, huh? You got money, don’t ya?

     Dave pulls him toward a tavern.

                          MARTY (CONT’D)
               What are you talkin’ about, Dave,
               I’m under age!

                                                           DAVE
     Under age? Quit kiddin’ around! You been over 14 since — sinc
     e — well, s ince your 1 4th b irthda y!

     Dave ro ars at this “jo ke.”

                          MARTY (CONT’D)
               14? Listen, Dave, I gotta find Mom
               and Dad.

                          DAVE
               Dad? You gotta find Dad? That’s
               sick, Marty, that’s really sick.
               What’s the matter with you, anyway?
               And since when are you and Mom on
               speaking terms again?

                          MARTY
               Speaking terms? Look, do you know
               where she is? Can you tell me where
               I can find Mom?

                          DAVE
                    (shrugs)
               Same place as usual, I guess. In
               there.

     Dave points to BIFF TANNEN’S PARADISE MO TEL. Marty stares at
     the hotel, confused.

     He turns back to Dave, but Dave is already going into the
     bar. Marty is about to stop him, but then decid es no t to. H
     e aga in look s at B iff’s H otel.

     Marty app roache s it.

     Adjacent to the hotel is the BIFF TANNEN MUSEUM . Marty takes
     a look at the outside display area in front of the ticket
     window.

     cohorts from 1955.

                                                       SKINHEAD
     Hold on there, squirt. You’re comin’ with us: upstairs.

               27th floor??

     Marty sits up in horror as Lorraine sits down beside him and
     turns on the bedside lamp revealing a very different
     LORRAINE: At 47, she’s made up like Tammy Bakker, with an
     OUTRAG EOUS W IG, lots of jewels and an expensive, glittering
     gown — low cut, emphasizing her cleav age: bre ast imp lants

     MOM! You’re so — so — big!

     She puts a cigarette in a garish holder and lights up.

                                                       LORRAINE
     Everything’s going to be fine, Marty. Are you hungry? We can
     call room service...

     Marty looks around at the garishly decorated bedroom. The
     large picture window shows that we’re 15 stories up: this is
     the PENTHOUS E of the Paradise.

                                                       LORRAINE
     I forgot, you haven’t seen the penthouse since we redeco
     rated...

     From outside, we hear a MALE VOICE.

                          VOIC E (O.S .)
               Lorraine? Where are you?

     half the man he was!
     Biff glares at her, then slaps her.

                          BIFF (CONT’D)
               Never talk to me like that, you

               Damm it, Biff, that’s it. I’m
               leaving.
     Lorraine heads for the door.

                          BIFF
               Sure, walk out: And I’ll cut you
               off — you and your kids.
     Lorraine hesitates.

     Biff storm s out.

     Marty turns to his mother in disbelief, his eyes full of
     unasked questions. Lorraine looks away from him, ashamed.

                          LORRAINE

     INT. DOC’S LAB — NIGHT
     MARTY is reading it while Doc explains. They’re in Doc’s lab
     which is a shambles: it’s been vandalized, windows are
     boarded up, and the scene is lit by candles.
     The DeLorean is parked in the garage, and EINSTEIN is here,
     too.

                          DOC
               I went to the public library to try
               to make sense out of all the
               madness. The place was boarded up,
               shut down. So I broke in and
               borrowed some newspapers.

                                                          MARTY
     But, Doc, how can all this be happening? I mean, it’s like
     we’re in hell or something.

                          DOC (CONT’D)
               No, it’s Hill Valley, although I
               can’t imagine hell being much
               worse. The continuum has been

               This was the top part of Biff’s
               cane — in the future. And you found
               it in the DeLorean?

                          DOC
               Correct. It was in the time machine
               because Biff was in the time m
               achine, with the Sports Almanac.

               You see, while we were in the

     INT. BIFF’S PENTHOUSE — NIGHT

     BIFF is in a Jacuzzi with 2 SHOWG IRLS while watching “A
     Fistful of Dollars” on a big screen TV.

                          BIFF
               Great flick. Great friggin’ flick.

     Suddenly, the screen goes black.

                          BIFF (CONT’D)
               Hey, w hat th e hell— ?

     MART Y steps forward with the remo te controller.

                          MARTY
               Party’s over, Biff.

                                                           BIFF
     You! W hat a re you doing here ? Ho w the hell did you ge t
     in here, anyway? How’d you get past my security downstairs?

                          MARTY (CONT’D)
               I managed.

                          BIFF
               W ell, you got just 1 0 seco nds to
               ge t your ass th e hell outta here
               or yo u’re gonn a have to be carrie

     Biff picks up a nearby phone.

                                                          MARTY
     There ’s a little matter I need to ta lk to you ab out.

                          BIFF (CONT’D)
               Mone y, right? W ell, forget it.

                          MARTY

                                                          MARTY
     You know what I’m talking about: it’s a book, paperback,
     silver cover and jacket, with ------- letters.

     Biff puts the phone down.

                          BIFF
               You heard him, girls: party’s over.

                                                        CUT TO:

     INT. PENTHOUSE — BIFF’S PRIVATE OFFICE — NIGHT

     MARTY is examining the matchbook, which was picked up from a
     table in BIFF’S PRIVATE * OFFICE, which is plushly (and
     garishly) furnished.

     BIFF, now clad in a silk monogrammed robe, pours himself a
     Scotch.

                          MARTY
               “Biff’s Pleasure Paradise.” Very
               cute.

                          BIFF
               Start talkin’, kid. What else do
               you know about that book?

     Marty pockets the matchbook.

                          MARTY
               First you tell m e how you got it.
               How, w here, wh en...

     Biff s tares at him , then sm iles slyly.

                          BIFF
               All right.

     Biff gets up and goes to an OIL PORTRAIT of himself. It’s
     hinged — he opens it, revealing a WALL SA FE with 3
     combination locks.

                                                           BIFF
     November 12, 1955. That was when.

                          MARTY
               1955?

                          BIFF
               It was at school, at this dance.

                                                          MARTY
     The Enchantment Under the Sea Dance?

                          BIFF (CONT’D)
               How d o you kn ow abo ut that?

                          MARTY
               Oh, uh, my father told me about
               that dance... uh, before he died.

                                                           BIFF
     W ell, the re I wa s, m indin’ m y own busin ess , and this c
     razy old codger with a cane calls me over. He says he’s my
     distant relative; I don’t know if he is, he doesn’t even look
     like me. So * he says, “How would you like to be rich?” I
     says “sure,” so he lays this book on me.

     Biff opens the safe and pulls out a smaller fireproof
     airtight SEALED CONTAINER. He unlocks it, revealing one item
     inside: the SPORTS ALMANAC. It’s 30 years older, yellowed,
     stained, * and wo rn. It no longe r has the dust jack et.

     He lets M arty have a look at it.

                          BIFF
               He says this book’ll tell me the
               outcome of every sporting event
               till the end of the century. All I
               have to do is bet on the winner and
               I’ll never lose. Naturally, I think
               he’s full of it. So I say, what’s
               the catch ? And h e says, no catch.
               Ju st keep it a secret. T hen he
               says “Biff T annen , you’re one lu
               cky guy.” After that, he
               disappeared and I never saw him
               again.

     Biff takes the book back from Marty and locks it in the safe.

                          BIFF (CONT’D)
               Oh, he told me one m ore thing. H e
               said, so med ay a crazy wild-e yed
               sc ientis t or a k id m ay sho w up

               be you...

     Marty gulps.

                          MARTY
               Yeah, well, you’re forgetting one
               thing — Hey, look!

     Biff falls for it and looks; Marty grabs Biff’s scotch and
     throws it in his face!

     Marty bolts.

     BIFF FIRES a few shots, but Marty’s outta there! Biff picks
     up a phone.

                          BIFF

                          BIFF
                    (raises the gun)
               Lead poisoning.

     Marty looks down. He’s scared.

                                                          MARTY
     And what happens to you when the police match the bullet up
     to that gun?

                          BIFF (CONT’D)
                    (laughs)
               Kid, I own the police. Besides,
               they couldn’t match up the bullet
               that killed your old man.

     Marty is shocked at this revelation.

                          BIFF (CONT’D)
                    (chuckles)
               I suppose it’s poetic justice: 2
               McFlys with the same gun.

     Biff cocks the gun.

     Then, Marty jump s off the roof!

     Biff is amazed.

     He run s to the ed ge and looks d own...

     Suddenly, MARTY RISES UP, STANDING ON THE HOOD OF THE FLYING
     DELOREAN!

     Before Biff can re act...

     DOC throws open the gullwing door and cracks Biff in the

     Biff falls backward.

     Marty climbs into the DeLorean, closes the do or, and they
     fly off

     Biff just lays there, out cold.

     self!

                          MARTY (CONT’D)
               My other self?

     Marty realizes what DOC m eans. He looks down to the parking
     area and sees:


     A-310 EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT (BINOCULARS POV)

                                                          A-310

     The YELLOW PACKARD with LORRAINE and the “other” Marty (we’ll
     refer to him as ‘55 MAR TY) is pu lling into the sc hool park
     ing lot!

                          MARTY
               This is getting strange.

     Marty then goes back to wa tching the 2 Biffs in the car.

     Old Biff gives young Biff the Almanac.

     Young Biff gets out of the car.

                          OLD BIFF
               Biff T ann en, yo u’re o ne luc ky
               gu y.

     Young Biff slams the do or.

     Old Biff revs up the car, backs up and drives out of there.

     Young Biff looks at the book and shakes his head at the
     departing Old Biff as if he’s a nut case.

                          BIFF
               What a butthead!

     Biff shoves the book in the back of his pants, then pulls out
     his girlie mag and saunters over against a chain link fence
     at the stairs landing.

     Biff le ans again st the fenc e and look s at th e m aga
     zine. T he A lma nac is stic king out o f his pants. It’s a
     perfect opportunity for Marty to get the book.

     quietly whispers into the walkie-talkie.

                          MARTY
               All right, Doc, the old guy just
               left and I’m gonna make m y mov
               e...

     Marty poc kets the walkie-talk ie and leap s over the parape

     He dro ps into the stairwell on th e oppo site side of the
     fenc e which B iff is leaning a gainst.

     Marty moves into position.

     He se es the alm anac in B iff’s pants, e asily able to gra b
     it.

     He rea ches fo r it...

     And then STR ICKLAND steps out of the adjoining building and
     starts toward Biff.

                                                     STRICKLAND
     Well, well, Mr. Tannen, how nice to see you here.

     Biff turns, h ides the m agazine b ehind his back a nd tries
     to a ct innoce nt.

                          BIFF
               W hy, Mr. Strickland, sir, nice to
               see you here, sir.

     Strickland sniffs Biff’s breath.

                                                     STRICKLAND
     Is that liquor I smell, Tannen?

                          BIFF (CONT’D)
               I wouldn’t know, sir. I don’t know
               what liquor smells like becau se
               I’m to o young to drink it.

     I see. And what do we have ... here?

     Strickland reaches behind Biff’s back and pulls out the
     SPORTS ALMAN AC. He looks at the cover.

                                                     STRICKLAND

     STRICKLAND’S OFFICE is a double office: an outer and inner
     office, separated by a glass partition.
     Marty is able to see Mr. Strickland in the inner office. His
     desk has an open kneehole.

     318 MARTY quietly enters the outer office. He peeks through
     the partition and sees

     318-A STRICKLAND who puts the Almanac on his desk, sits down
     on his swivel chair and opens a

               drawer. He pulls out a WHISKEY
               BOTTLE.

     Strickland reacts as if he’s heard a noise. A beat, then he
     shrugs and takes another nip.
     Marty crams through the kneehole and reaches through with his
     hand in an effort to reach the Almanac which is on top of the
     desk.
     Just as Marty is about to reach it, Strickland turns. Marty
     withdraws his hand.

     Strickland stands: he’s ready to leave.
     Marty smiles. Finally he’s going to get his chance.
     Strickland moves away from the desk. A beat, then Strickland
     looks back at the desk and TAKES THE ALMANAC WITH HIM!
     Marty is horrified!
     He watches as Strickland heads for the door.
     Then Strickland simply tosses the book in the trash can and
     EXITS!
     Marty sighs relief.
     As soon as the door to the hall closes, Marty goes for the
     trash can and pulls out the book.
     He’s got it! There’s that red cover: “SPORTS ALMAN AC!”
     Marty sighs relief. He picks it up, opens it and sees

     Marty checks to see that ‘55 Marty is looking in the other
     direction, then he dashes up the stairs and goes BACKSTAGE.

     Marty can see Biff’s guys waiting at the other end.

     Marty looks around, trying to figure out what to do. Then he
     looks UP and sees a CATWALK * that runs above the stage.
     THREE SANDB AGS on a rope are situated right above Biff’s
     boys. *

     Marty has an idea. He climbs u p the stage-right catwalk
     ladder.

     Marty regains his balance and makes it to the other end of

     ‘55 Marty runs off like a streak, oblivious to what’s just

     MARTY gasps. He picks up the other end of the rope: severed
     clean.

     Everything gets quie t.

     Marty stares upward in stunned silence, waiting for the
     DeLorean to reappear.

     Nothing happens.

     t.

     Hill Valley 1888 is a typical western town... yet even now
     bears a little resemblance to the town Marty’s familiar with.

     The town is built around a grassy square, where a flagpole
     flies the Stars and Stripes (38 stars). The streets are, of
     course, dirt and mud. Where there’s a sidewalk, it’s wooden.

     The COURT HOUSE is just starting construction; there are the
     MARBLE PILLARS, and some very rough framing.

     There’s a SALOON (roughly in the location that the cafe will
     be): a BLACKSMITH, STABLES, a HOTEL, a GENERAL STORE, a
     BARBER SHOP, a WELLS FARGO office and a BANK.

     The M ARSH AL’S O FFIC E: A sign on the do or reads : “CLO
     SED: G ONE FISHIN G.”

     There is PEDESTRIAN traffic, CARRIAGE traffic, MEN and BOYS
     on HOR SES, and a number of CHINESE.

     Some of them give Marty looks: his clothes don’t go
     unnoticed.

     Suddenly,a MAN runs through the street, yelling.

                          MAN
               He’s com in’! H e’s co min ’!

     Imm ediately, people clear the street, running into
     buildings, or running around the corner.

     Shopkeepers slam their doors and windows.

     Behind Marty, 4 H ORS EME N, all rough looking c haracte rs,
     com e thunde ring dow n the stree t.

     They halt just a few feet behind Marty and draw pistols.

                                                     BLACK BIFF
     W hatcha doin’ in m y street, runt?

     Marty turns and faces the men.

                          MARTY
               Huh?

     It’s BUFORD “BLACK BIFF” TANNEN: jet black hair and beard,
     and mean eyes, just like the pictu re we saw in the d ocu me
     ntary.

     He’s accompanied by 3 cronies, STUBBLE, CEEGAR and BUCK.

                          BLACK BIFF
               I charge cash money for any egg

                          BLACK BIFF
               Nothin’? Buck: check his teeth for
               gold or silver.

     BUCK dismounts and examines Marty’s teeth.

                          BUCK
               W ell, lookee a t these pe arly

     It says “Ne e—K ay.”

                          BLACK BIFF (CONT’D)
               Well, shorty, why don’t you show us

                          BLACK BIFF
               I said, DANCE!

     Black Biff fires a shot right in front of Marty’s feet...
     then another.

     Marty starts dancing — first a few hops, to the delight of
     Biff and the boys... then Marty goes into a Mich ael Jack son
     style m oonwa lk, as he m umb les the lyrics to “B illie
     Jean.”

     Biff and the guys trade looks at this bizarre style of
     dancing.

     Biff’s cronies tense up. There’s going to be some serious
     trouble.

     Marty kn ows it, too, bu t he’s too pe trified to run. B iff
     gets to his feet.

                          BLACK BIFF (CONT’D)
               Buck: gimme a rope.

     Buck throws him a coil of rope.

                          MARTY
               What are you gonna do?

                          BLACK BIFF
               I’m g onn a m ake you ta ller, sh
               orty.

     Black Biff throws the rope around Marty’s neck, jumps on his
     horse, and starts off down the street.

     to g et the noos e off his ne ck, b ut he can’t run fast
     enough. He stumbles, and is dragged around the square. Black
     Biff laughs and yells, and his boys do likewise.

     Townspeople come out to see what’s going on.

     Black Biff guides his horse into the grassy square.

     He throws the rope over an overhanging tree branch and pulls.

     Black Biff and gang are laughing, having a great time
     watching Marty struggle.

     Suddenly, another SHOT RINGS OUT and the rope above Marty is
     severed!

     Marty falls to the ground.

     Black B iff and ga ng turn in th e direction of the sh ot.

     Everyone turns.

     A woman, CLARA, is standing in the street holding a most
     intimidating weapon: 4 SAWED-OFF SHOT GUN BARRE LS mounted in
     fan-shaped arrangement in a yoke on a 4-trigger stock.

     Clara looks like a school teacher, with a touch of quirkiness
     that makes her instantly likeable.

     Biff considers his options, then smiles and wave s his boys

     They holster their guns.

     Marty gets up, relieved to see Doc. He rubs his neck. He’s
     weak and little pale.

     MARTY, unconscious on a bed, now opens his eyes and looks
     around.

     Doc’s worksho p, lit by FAT LAM PS, contains tools, anvils, a
     forge and workbenche s. There are also various inventions
     that Doc has conco cted to modernize his surround ings:
     wooden gutters for indoor plumbing, a steam operated toilet,
     and a pulley system to open windows and control ventilation.

     Marty examines some of these inventions.

     Now CLARA enters with a TRAY OF FOOD.

                          CLARA
               Hello. Feeling better?

                          MARTY

               What about the locomotive?

     Doc winds up the toy locomotive, and sets it on the tracks:
     it pushes the wooden model DeLorean. As it reaches the ed ge,
     Doc picks up the D eLorean while the locomo tive falls off,
     crashing to the floor.

     MARTY walks down the street, being careful to avoid stepping
     in the horse dung.

     As he passes the BUTCHER SHOP, a CHICKEN runs out, chased by
     the BUTCHER with an AXE.

     Then Marty notices the BARBER at the aide of the BARBERSHOP
     chiseling lettering on a TOMBST ONE: “Here lies...” It’s the
     exact size and shape of Doc’s tombstone.

               not yet married.

     An attractive BAR GIRL (who looks quite a bit like Lorraine)
     is giving Seamus a flirtatious smile.

                          MARTY
               You will be. Listen, Seamus, buddy,
               is there another way out of here?

     Aye. There’s a way through the back, there is. Right through

     Now DO C suddenly sits up, wide-eyed and sober.

                          MARTY (CONT’D)
               Doc! You all right?

     Doc looks around, gets his bearings, nods.

                          DOC
               I think so. Whew!!

     Marty helps Doc up and they move toward the back. Marty looks
     back at Seamus.

                          BLACK BIFF

               I’m right here, Tannen.

     Marty’s ha nds are emp ty and he w ears no gunbe lt.

                          BLACK BIFF
               Where’s your iron?

                          MARTY
               I’m not wearing one. I thought we
               could settle this thing like men.

     With that, Marty clenches his fists.

                          BLACK BIFF
               You thought wrong, dude.

     Biff draws his pistol and FIRES right at Marty’s chest! Marty
     falls.

     Biff laughs . Biff walks down th e street tow ard the fa llen
     Marty. W hen Biff is a lmos t to him...

     Marty gets up!

     Biff c an’t b elieve it! He shoo ts ag ain, b ut his gun’s em
     pty.

     Biff th rows his gu n dow n, rus hes Mar ty and throw s a pu
     nch into his gut — and h owls in pain with the CRACK of his
     knuckle bones!

     Marty socks Biff in the face and kicks him in the groin. Biff
     goes down.

                          BLACK BIFF (CONT’D)
               Buck! Kill the blacksmith!

     Buck pulls his gun.

     Suddenly, an array of guns cock.

                                                         SEAMUS
     Sure’n I’d be droppin’ that gun if I were you.

     Seamus holds a shotgun on him, and a number of men from the
     saloon all have guns pointed at Biff’s men.

     Biff’s men wisely throw down their guns.

     Marty throws off his serape, revealing the CAST IRON DOOR
     from the pot bellied stove!

     A BO Y, 7, ru ns up to Ma rty, exc itedly.

                          BOY

                          MARTY
               I saw it in a Clint Eastwood movie.

                          BOY
               Movie? What’s a movie?

                          MARTY

     Marty takes out the Polaroid.

     the photo, so that the picture shows the other to mbs tones b

     555 BACK TO SHOT

     Biff, still on the ground, clutches his hand in pain.

                                                     BLACK BIFF
     It’s broke! My gun hand’s broke!

               my farm, sloppin’ hogs and washin’
               wagons.

     The TRAIN W HISTLE blows in the distance.

     Doc toots the WHISTLE, then releases the brake.

     Air shoots out of the cylinders.

     Doc opens the throttle.

     The pistons push the wheels.

     The locomotive inches slowly forward.

     The cowcatcher bumps up to the rear of the DeLorean and
     pushes it forward.

     Marty smiles.
     574 CLARA comes running up just as the locomotive pulls away.

     Clara walks across the wood, toward the locomotive, but loses
     her balance. She falls into the woodpile.

     The DELOREAN speedometer gauge is at 25.

     Doc climbs out of the cab and along the side of the engine.
     Clara has regained her balance and is again climbing across
     the wood in the tender toward the locomotive.

     In the furn ace, the c loth aroun d the Pre sto Log s burns
     away and the logs the mse lves beg in to burn with a GREENISH
     FLAME.

     Green smoke comes out of the smoke stack.

     Doc sees it and smiles.

     The locomotive PRESSURE GAUGE suddenly increases.

     The locomotive accelerates!

     The DeLorean digital speedometer shows 36...37...38... Doc is
     about halfway to the front of the engine. The WALKW AY creaks
     and gives — the metal is brittle.

     Clara makes it across the wood, and climbs down into the
     locomotive cab.

                          CLARA
               EMMETT !!!

     Doc can’t hear her.

     She sticks her head out of the cab and waves at Doc.

     But Doc is looking toward the front of the train.

     Clara screams and waves wildly, but can’t get his attention.

     Doc is just about to the cowcatcher.

     The speedometer passes 45.

     Clara blows the whistle.

     EXT. TRAIN TRACKS

     The head-on collision is unavoidable!

     The DeLorean slows, the gullwing door is thrown open and
     MARTY rolls out of the DeLorean just as the Diesel engine
     SMASHES into the DeLorean, TOTALLY DESTR OYING IT, sending
     wreckage everywhere!

     The Diesel keeps on going!

     706 MARTY catches his breath and looks around.

     Twisted me tal debris and pieces of the DeLorean a re strewn
     all over.

     There are small piles of burning heaps.

                          MARTY
               Oh, God, no! No!!!

     Marty drops to his knees, weeping.

                          MARTY (CONT’D)
               Well, Doc, it’s destroyed. Just
               like you wanted.

     EXT. LYON GATES (1985) — DAY

     A very depressed Marty McFly walks through the familiar Lyon
     Gates and down the street toward his house.

     Up ahead, BIFF’S AUTO DETAILING TRUCK can be seen parked.
     BIFF is waxing someb ody’s car.

                          BIFF
               Hi, Marty. How’s everything.

                          MARTY
                    (without any enthusiasm)
               Fine.

                          BIFF
               Gone cowboy, eh?

                          MARTY
               Yeah.
     708 EXT. McFLY HOME, 1985 — DAY

     Marty walks up his driveway. The garage is open and his black
     Toyota truck is in there.

     But even the sight of his truck does nothing to buoy his
     spirits.

     As M arty ap proa che s the fron t doo r, GE OR GE and L OR
     RAI NE p ull into t he dr ivewa y in their BMW . They get out
     of the car.

                                                         GEORGE
     Marty — what on earth are you wearinq?

                          MARTY (CONT’D)
               Oh, that’s a long story.

                          LORRAINE
               Where’ve you been? I thought you
               and Jennifer were up at the lake.

                          MARTY
               Jennifer! Oh m y God, Jennifer!

     EXT. JENNIFER’S HOUSE — DAY

     MARTY pulls up in his truck, gets out and runs over to the
     hammock. (There are now no security ba rs on the window .)

     He hesitates, then peeks into it: JENNIFE R is just as he
     left her. Marty sighs relief.

                                                          MARTY

     |Thank God!
     (sha kes her g ently)
     Jen? Jennifer?

     She MOANS but does not revive. He tries again. No go.
     Finally, he kisses her full on the mouth.

     She awakens with a start — scared, then just confused.

                          JENNIFER
               Mar ty!

               How d o you feel? Are you all righ

                          JENNIFER
               I think so, w ow, I thoug ht I
               was...
                    (sighs)
               I guess it was a dre am, b ut it
               was so real. Abou t the future ...
               about us... and our kids. Our kids
               were a mess, and you got fired...
               It was terrible.

                          MARTY
               W ell, everything’s fin e now. S
               ort of...

     Marty stop s at a traffic ligh t.

     Now, a hot RED CAMARO pulls up alongside.

                          DRIVER
               Hey, the Big M! How’s it hangin’,
               McFly! Nice truck! Let’s see what
               she can do.

     The driver is NEEDLES, 17: Marty’s future co-worker. He races
     his engine.

                          >MARTY
               No thanks, Needles.
     Marty pulls fo rward a few fee t.

                                                        NEEDLES
     C’mon, McFly. What’s the matter: Chicken?

     Jennifer reacts with concern.
     Needles makes “clucking” noises.

               Nobo dy calls m e chick en, Nee
               dles...
     Marty races his engine.
     Needles races his engine.

                          JENNIFER
               Marty, don ’t...
     Marty puts his hand on his stick shift.
     Marty look s at the sto plight. Red . The inter secting ligh
     t goes fro m G reen to Ye llow...
     Need les is read y...
     Marty has his clutch d own, rea dy to pop it.
     The two vehicles are like animals ready to charge.
     The light turns GREEN.
     The Cam aro ro ars o ff like a bat out o f hell!
     Marty’s truck just stays there.

                          MARTY
                    (shakes his head)
               But I’m not stupid, either.
     We hear a HORN HONK and a SCREECH O F BRAKES.


     711 MARTY’S P.O.V. THRU THE W INDSHIELD
     The Camaro narrowly avoids hitting a Rolls Royce that has
     pulled out of an intersecting drive way.

     712 MARTY is astonished. He sighs a “that was a close one”
     sigh.

                          MARTY
               Jeez! I woulda hit that Roll Royce!

                          JENNIFER
               Rolls Royce?
               She reaches into her pocket and
               pulls out the crumbled “You’re
               fired” fax.

     Jennifer looks at the fax page: the words “You’re fired”
     vanish from it; in fact all of the printing disappears!
     Jennifer exam ines it, amazed. It’s simply a blank piece of
     paper.

     She shakes her head, not sure if she imag ined it or wha t.

                          JENNIFER (CONT’D)
               It erased ...!

                          MARTY
                    (a beat)
               Maybe our future hasn’t be en
               written yet.

     She smiles.

     EXT. TRAIN TRACKS NEAR AIRPORT (W RECKAGE SITE) — DAY

     The DeLorean wreckage is still strewn along the tracks.

     Marty’s truc k pulls up and M arty gets ou t.

     Jennifer doesn’t understand.

                          JENNIFER
               What are we doing here?

                          MARTY
               I’ll just be a minute.

     Marty pokes through the pieces... a fender, a train wheel,
     part of a seat, a twisted piece of meta l that says “M r.
     Fusion ,” a section of the tim e displays: “L ast time
     departe d.”

     Finally he finds what he’s looking for: the square case
     containing the FLUX CAPACITOR.

     Mar ty pick s it up and e xam ines it. The glass cove r is sh
     atter ed, a nd ins ide, th e flux capa citor is broken.

     Marty sighs.

     Suddenly, there’s a TREMENDOUS SONIC BOOM.

     Marty and Jennifer react with total incredulity at what they
     see:

     A STEAM LOCO MOTIVE is there on the tracks and DOC BROW N is
     in the cab, wearing an Engine er’s hat.

     Of course, it’s been modified with big Tesla coils,
     condensers, and equipment that looks right out of Jules
     Verne... including a Victorian style flux capacitor!

                                                            DOC
     Marty! It runs on steam!

     With Doc in the cab is CLARA, and 2 BOYS, aged 4 and 6. And
     EINSTEIN, the dog.

                          DOC
               Oh, I’m married now. Meet the
               family! Clara, you know, and these
               are my boys: Jules and Verne! Boys,
               this is Marty. And Jennifer.

     Marty is dumbstruck.

                          MARTY
               Hi.

     Marty walks over to the locomotive and stares in awe... and
     joy in seeing the Doc.

                          MARTY (CONT’D)
               Doc... it’s unbelievable. This is
               wonderful! And here I thought I’d
               never see you again.

                          DOC
               You can’t keep a good scientist
               down. After all, I had to come back
               for Einstein. And I didn’t want you
               to be worried about me.

                          JENNIFER
               Docto r Brown , I just want to k
               now on e thing: W hat happ ens to
               Marty and me in the future?

                                                            DOC

     |Tha t’s up to you . You r futu re ha sn’t b een writte n —

     So make it a good one. Both of you.

     Doc winks.

     Marty puts his arm around Jennifer and smiles.

                          MARTY
               W e will, Doc. A nd wha t about you
               ? Are you going... bac k to the
               future?

                          DOC
               Nope: already been there!

     Doc pushes a lever: the locomotive wheels fold down, and the
     ENTIRE LOCOMOTIVE LIFTS UP OFF THE TRACK!

     MART Y and JENN IFER both watch in open m outhed disbelief!

     DOC and his family wave to Marty as the locomotive ascends
     higher and FLIES OFF INTO THE SKY!
