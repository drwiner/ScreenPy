     SCREEN BLACK

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 People were always asking me, did I

                 know Tyler Durden.

     FADE IN:

     INT.  SOCIAL ROOM - TOP FLOOR OF HIGH RISE -- NIGHT

     TYLER has one arm around Jack's shoulder; the other hand

     holds a HANDGUN with the barrel lodged in JACK'S MOUTH.

     Tyler is sitting in Jack's lap.

     They are both sweating and disheveled, both around 30; Tyler

     is blond, handsome; and Jack, brunette, is appealing in a

     dry sort of way.  Tyler looks at his watch.

                             TYLER

                 One minute.

                       (looking out window)

                 This is the beginning.  We're at

                 ground zero.  Maybe you should say a

                 few words, to mark the occasion.

                             JACK

                 ... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 With a gun barrel between your teeth,

                 you only speak in vowels.

     Jack tongues the barrel to the side of his mouth.

                             JACK

                       (still distorted)

                 I can't think of anything.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 With my tongue, I can feel the

                 rifling in the barrel.  For a second,

                 I totally forgot about Tyler's whole

                 controlled demolition thing and I

                 wondered how clean this gun is.

     Tyler checks his watch.

                             TYLER

                 It's getting exciting now.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 That old saying, how you always hurt

                 the one you love, well, it works both

                 way.

     Jack turns so that he can see down -- 31 STORIES.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 We have front row seats for this

                 Theater of Mass Destruction.  The

                 Demolitions Committee of Project

                 Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns

                 of ten buildings with blasting

                 gelatin.  In two minutes, primary

                 charges will blow base charges, and

                 those buildings will be reduced to

                 smoldering rubble.  I know this

                 because Tyler knows this.

                             TYLER

                 Look what we've accomplised.

                       (checks watch)

                 Thirty seconds.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Somehow, I realize all of this -- the

                 gun, the bombs, the revolution -- is

                 really about Marla Singer.

     PULL BACK from Jack's face.  It's pressed against TWO LARGE

     BREASTS that belong to...BOB, 45, a moose of a man.  Jack is

     engulfed by Bob in an intense embrace.  Bob weeps openly.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Bob had bitch tits.

     PULL BACK to wide on...

     INT. CHURCH MEETING ROOM - NIGHT

     Men are paired off, hugging, talking in emotional tones.

     Near the door, a SIGN on a stand: "REMAINING MEN TOGETHER."

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 This was a support group for men with

                 testicular cancer.  The big moosie

                 slobbering all over me was Bob.

                             BOB

                 We're still men.

                             JACK

                 Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Six months ago, Bob's testicles were

                 removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He

                 developed bitch tits because his

                 testosterone was too high and his

                 body upped the estrogen.  That was

                 where my head fit -- into his huge,

                 sweating tits that hung enormous, the

                 way we think of God's as big.

                             BOB

                 They're gonna have to open my pec's

                 again to drain the fluid.

     Bob hugs tighter; then looks with empathy into Jack's eyes.

                             BOB

                 Okay.  You cry now.

     Jack looks at Bob.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Wait.  Back up.  Let me start earlier.

     INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Jack lies in bed, staring at the ceiling.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 For six months.  I could not sleep.

     INT. COPY ROOM - DAY

     Jack, sleepy, stands over a copy machine.  His Starbucks cup

     sits on the lid, moving back and forth as the machine copies.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 With insomnia, nothing is real.

                 Everything is far away.  Everything

                 is a copy of a copy of a copy.

     Other people make copies, all with Starbucks cups, sipping.

     Jack picks up his cup and his copies and leaves.

     INT. JACK'S OFFICE - SAME

     Jack, sipping, stares blankly at a Starbucks bag on the

     floor, full of newspapers and FAST FOOD GARBAGE.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 When deep space exploration ramps up,

                 it will be corporations that name

                 everything.  The IBM Stellar Sphere.

                 The Philip Morris Galaxy.  Planet

                 Starbucks.

     Jack looks up as a pudgy man, Jack's BOSS, enters, Starbucks

     cup in hand, and slides a stack of reports on Jack's desk.

                             BOSS

                 I'm going to need you out-of-town a

                 little more this week.  We've got

                 some "red-flags" to cover.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 It must've been Tuesday.  he was

                 wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.

                             JACK

                       (listless management speak)

                 You want me to de-prioritize my

                 current reports until you advise of

                 a status upgrade?

                             BOSS

                 You need to make these your primary

                 "action items."

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 He was full of pep.  Must've had his

                 grande latte enema.

                             BOSS

                 Here are your flight coupons.  Call

                 me from the road if there are any

                 snags.  Your itinerary...

     Jack hides a yawn, pretends to listen.

     INT. BATHROOM - JACK'S CONDO - NIGHT

     Jack sits on the toilet, CORDLESS PHONE to his ear, flips

     through an IKEA catalog.  There's a stack of old Playboy

     magazines and other catalogs nearby.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Like everyone else, I had become a

                 slave to the IKEA nesting instinct.

                             JACK

                       (into phone)

                 Yes.  I'd like to order the Erika

                 Pekkari slip covers.

     Jack drops the open catalog on the floor.

     MOVE IN ON CATALOG -- ON PHOTO of COFFEETABLE SET...

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 If I saw something like clever coffee

                 table sin the shape of a yin and

                 yang, I had to have it.

     PAN TO PHOTO of ARMCHAIR...

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Like the Johanneshov armchair in the

                 Strinne green stripe pattern...

     INT. LIVING ROOM/DINING AREA/KITCHEN

     The armchair APPEARS.  PAN OVER next to armchair...

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Or the Rislampa wire lamps of

                 environmentally-friendly unbleached

                 paper.

     The lamps APPEAR.  PAN OVER to wall...

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Even the Vild hall clock of

                 galvanized steel, resting on the

                 Klipsk shelving unit.

     The clock APPEARS as the shelving unit APPEARS on the wall.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 I would flip through catalogs and

                 wonder, "What kind of dining set

                 defines me as a person?"  We used to

                 read pornography.  Now it was the

                 Horchow Collection.

     A dining room set APPEARS.  Jack, the cordless phone still

     glued to his ear, walks INTO FRAME and continues.

                             JACK

                 No, I don't want Cobalt.  Oh, that

                 sounds nice.  Apricot.

     Jack opens a cabinet, takes out a plate.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 I had it all.  Even the glass dishes

                 with tiny bubbles and imperfections,

                 proof they were crafted by the

                 honest, simple, hard-working

                 indigenous peoples of wherever.

     He rummages through the refrigerator.  It's practically

     empty.  Jack takes out a jar of mustard, opens it and uses

     a butter knife to eat it.

     INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

     Jack, eyes puffy, face pale, sits before an INTERN, who

     studies him with bemusement.

                             INTERN

                 No, you can't die of insomnia.

                             JACK

                 Maybe I died already.  Look at my

                 face.

                             INTERN

                 You need to lighten up.

                             JACK

                 Can't you give me something?

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red

                 Seconals.

                             INTERN

                       (overlapping w/ above)

                 You need healthy, natural sleep.

                 Chew valerian root and get some more

                 exercise.

     The Intern ushes Jack to the door.  They step into the...

     INT. HALLWAY

     The Intern walks away from Jack, picks up a chart.

                             JACK

                 I'm in pain.

                             INTERN

                       (facetious)

                 You want to see pain?  Swing by First

                 Methodist Tuesday nights.  See the

                 guys with testicular cancer.  That's

                 pain.

     The Intern moves into the other room.  Jack stares after him.

     EXT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH - NIGHT

     Jack heads for the front door.

     INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - NIGHT

     Jack stares at a group of men, including Bob, who are all

     listening to a group member speak at a lectern.  The SPEAKER

     has pale skin and sunken eyes -- he's clearly dying.

                             SPEAKER

                 I... wanted three kids.  Two boys and

                 a girl.  Mindy wanted two girls and

                 one boy.  We never could agree on

                 anything.

     The Speaker cracks a sad smile.  Some men chuckle, happy to

     lighten the mood.

                             SPEAKER

                 Well, she had her first child a month

                 ago, a girl, with her new husband...

                 And, Thank God.  I'm glad for her,

                 because she deserves...

     The speaker breaks down, WEEPS UNCONTROLLABLY.

     Jack watches.  A couple of the men go up to the speaker,

     comforting him, leading him away.  A LEADER takes the stand.

                             LEADER

                 Everyone, let's thank Thomas for

                 sharing himself with us.

     Jack, uncomfortable, joins EVERYONE ELSE:

                             EVERYONE

                       (in unison)

                 Thank you, Thomas.

                             LEADER

                 I look around this room and I see a

                 lot of courage.  And it gives me

                 strength.  We give each other

                 strength.

     Jack looks around.  Many of the men are sniffling, sobbing.

     Jack squirms in his seat.

                             LEADER

                 It's time for the one-on-one.  Let's

                 follow Thomas's example and open

                 ourselves.

     Everyone gets out of their chairs and begins pairing-off.

     Jack stands, uncomfortable.

                             LEADER

                 Can everyone find a partner?

     Bob, his chin down on his chest, starts toward Jack,

     shuffling his feet.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 The big moosie, his eyes already

                 shrink-wrapped in tears.  Knees

                 together, invisible steps.

     Bob takes Jack into an embrace.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Bob was a champion bodybuilder.  You

                 know that chest expansion program you

                 see on TV?  That was his idea.

                             BOB

                 ...using steroids.  I was a juicer.

                 Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for

                 racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm

                 bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids

                 won't return my calls...

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Strangers with this kind of honesty

                 make me go a big rubbery one.

     Bob breaks into sobbing, putting his head on Jack's shoulder

     and completely covering Jack's face.  After a long beat of

     crying, Bob raises up his head, looks at Jack's NAMETAG.

                             BOB

                 Go ahead, Cornelius.  You can cry.

     They look at each other.  Slowly, Jack's eyes grow wet.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Then... something happened.  I was

                 lost in oblivion -- dark and silent

                 and complete.

     Bob pulls Jack's head back into his chest.  Jack tightens

     his arms around Bob.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 I found freedom.  Losing all hope was

                 freedom.

     Jack pulls away from Bob.  On Bob's chest, there's a WET

     MASK of Jack's face from how he looks weeping.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Babies don't sleep this well.

     INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Jack lies sound asleep.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 I became addicted.

     INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - NIGHT

     Jack moves into a "group hug" of sickly people, men and

     women.  In view is a sign by the door "Free and Clear."

     INT. OFFICE BUILDING BASEMENT - NIGHT

     Jack stands with a weeping middle-aged WOMAN.  He begins to

     cry along with her.  A sign by the door: "Onward and Upward."

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 If I didn't say anything, people

                 assumed the worst.  They cried

                 harder.  I cried harder.

     INT. PUBLIC BUILDING CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

     Everyone, including Jack, sits back in their seats, EYES

     CLOSED.  The Leader speaks into a microphone.

                             LEADER

                 Tonight, we're going to open the

                 green door -- the heart chakra...

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host

                 to cancer or parasites; I was the

                 warm little center that the life of

                 this world crowded around.

                             LEADER

                 ...And you open the door and you

                 step inside.  We're inside our

                 hearts.  Now, imaging your pain as a

                 white ball of healing light.  That's

                 right, the pain itself is a ball of

                 healing light.

     Jack, eyes closed, is silent...

                             LEADER

                 It moves over your body, healing you.

                 Keep this going and step forward,

                 through the back door of the room.

                 Where does it lead?  To your cave.

                 Step forward into your cave.

     INT. CAVE - JACK'S IMAGINATION

     Jack walks along, moving through an ICE CAVERN...

                             LEADER'S VOICE

                 That's right.  You're going deeper

                 into your cave.  And you're going to

                 find your power animal...

     Jack comes upon a PENGUIN.  The penguin looks at him, cocks

     his head to signal Jack forward.

                             PENGUIN

                 Slide.

     The penguin jumps onto a patch of ICE and slides away.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     Jack walks out a doorway, saying goodbye to people.  He

     walks down the sidewalk, shining with peace.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Every evening I died and every

                 evening I was born again.  Resurrected.

                                                      CUT BACK TO:

     INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - RESUMING

     Jack's still in an embrace with Bob.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Bob loved me because he thought my

                 testicles were removed too.  Being

                 there, my face against his tits,

                 ready to cry -- this was my vacation.

     MARLA SINGER enters.  She has short matte black hair and

     big, dark eyes like a character from japanese animation.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 And, she ruined everything.

     Marla looks around, raises a cigarette to her lips.

                             MARLA

                 This is cancer, right?

     Bob and Jack stare, dumbfounded.

     INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - LATER

     Everyone paired-off.  MOVE THROUGH ROOM... FIND JACK'S FACE

     as he stares... MOVE THROUGH ROOM... FIND MARLA'S FACE.

     She's drinking coffee, smoking a cigarette.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 This ... chick ... Marla Singer ...

                 did not have testicular cancer.  She

                 was a liar.

     INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - NIGHT

     Marla sits with the group, smoking, listening intently while

     a member speaks.  Jack spies on her.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 She had no diseases at all.  I had

                 seen her at my melanoma Monday night

                 group ...

     INT. CATHOLIC CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

     Marla sits at the end of a row, smoking.  All the faces down

     the row are turned toward her, incredulous...

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 ... and at "Free and Clear," my blood

                 parasites group Thursdays.

     Jack leans out further than the others, scornful.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 -- And, again, at "Seize The Day," my

                 tuberculosis Friday night.

                                                      CUT BACK TO:

     INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT

     Jack watches... Marla's eyes are closed, her head on the

     shoulder of the MAN she's embraced by.  She opens her eyes,

     catching Jack's stare.  Jack looks away.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Marla -- the big tourist.  Her lie

                 reflected my lie.

     Marla rests her chin on the man's shoulder.  Tears roll down

     her cheeks.  She wipes at them.

     EXT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH - NIGHT

     Marla walks out,  The support group's dispersing.  Jack

     exits amongst them.  He spots Marla walking away.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 And suddenly, I felt nothing.  I

                 couldn't cry.  So, once again, I

                 could not sleep.

     Jack stares after Marla for a long moment.  He walks away.

     INT. BEDROOM - LATER

     Jack, in underwear, is cross-legged on the floor, assembling

     IKEA furniture, CORDLESS PHONE shouldered to his ear.

                             JACK

                       (into phone)

                 No, I just can't believe that card is

                 declined -- Okay, okay, let me give

                 you a different card number.

     Jack gets his wallet off the floor, pulls out another card

     and, MOS over the following, he reads it into the phone.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Next group, after guided meditation,

                 after we open our chakras, when it's

                 time to hug, I'm going to grab that

                 little bitch, Marla Singer, pin her

                 arms against her sides and say...

     INT. MEETING ROOM - NIGHT - JACK'S IMAGINATION

     CLOSE ON JACK as he CLAMPS his arms around Marla.

                             JACK

                 Marla, you liar, you big tourist.  I

                 need this.  Get out.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

     Jack, in pajamas, stares at Home Shopping Network on his TV.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 When you have insomnia, you're never

                 really asleep and you're never really

                 awake.  I hadn't slept in four days...

     INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - NIGHT

     Jack walks in and joins the crowd, looking around.  People

     are chattering with each other.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 -- But, in here, in everyone, there's

                 the squint of a five-day headache.

                 Yet they forced themselves to be

                 positive.  They never said

                 "parasite;" they said "agent."  They

                 always talked about getting better.

                             LEADER

                 Okay, everyone.

     Everyone sits in chairs.  Jack catches sight of Marla.

                             LEADER

                 To open tonight's communion, Chloe

                 would like to say a few words.

     Taking the lectern is CHLOE, a pale, sickly girl whose skin

     stretches yellowish and tight over her bones.  She wears a

     head bondage.  She clears her throat.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Ahh, Chloe.  Chloe looked the way

                 Joni Mitchell's skeleton would look

                 if you made it smile and walk around

                 a party being extra nice to everyone.

                             CHLOE

                 Well, I'm still here -- but I don't

                 know for how long.  That's as much

                 certainty as anyone can give me.  but

                 I've got some good news -- I no

                 longer have any fear of death.

     APPLAUSE from around the room.

                             CHLOE

                 But... I am in a pretty lonely place.

                 No one will have sex with me.  I'm so

                 close to the end and all I want is to

                 get laid for the last time.  I have

                 pornographic movies in my apartment,

                 and lubricants and amyl nitrate ...

     The LEADER gingerly takes control of the microphone.

                             LEADER

                 Thank you, Chloe.  Everyone, let's

                 thank Chloe.

                             EVERYONE

                 Thank you, Chloe.

     INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - LATER

                             LEADER

                 Now, you're standing at the entrance

                 to your cave.  You step inside your

                 cave and you walk.  Keep walking.

     Jack's face, eyes closed, is motionless.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 If I did have a tumor, I'd name it

                 Marla.  Marla...the little scratch on

                 the roof of your mouth that would

                 heal if only you could stop tonguing

                 it, but you can't.

                             LEADER

                 Now, find your power animal.

     INT. CAVE - JACK'S IMAGINATION

     Jack finds Marla smoking a cigarette.  Marla cocks her head,

     indicating whe wants him to --

                             MARLA

                 Slide.

     INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - RESUMING

     Jack's eyes open and turn to Marla, watching her blow smoke

     rings with her eyes closed.

     INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - LATER

     Everyone stands and mills about, pairing-off.

                             LEADER

                 Pick someone special to you tonight.

     Jack sees the ghastly spectre of Chloe ambling towards him.

     He tries to smile.  She smiles with a twisted, dying mouth.

                             CHLOE

                 Hello, Mr. Tayler.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 I never gave my real name at support

                 groups.

                             JACK

                 Hi, Chloe.

                             CHLOE

                 We've never actually talked.

     Chloe's eyes are eerily bright with desperation.  Jack, in

     a sincere attempt at levity, chokes out:

                             JACK

                 You look good.  You ... look ... like

                 a pirate.

     Chloe laughs, a little too much.  Jack squeezes out a laugh.

     Then he sees Marla, off by herself.  Someone heads for her.

                             JACK

                 Excuse me, I have to...

     Jack gives a quick nod to Chloe and darts towards Marla.

     Chloe watches him go.

     STAY ON JACK AND MARLA as Jack CLAMPS his arms around her.

     He whispers into her ear.

                             JACK

                 We need to talk.

                             MARLA

                 Sure.

                             JACK

                 I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You

                 aren't dying.

                             MARLA

                 What?

                             JACK

                 Okay, in the Sylvia Plath philosophy

                 way, we're all dying.  But you're not

                 dying the way Chloe is dying.

                             LEADER

                 Tell the other person how you feel.

                             JACK

                 You're a tourist.  I saw you at

                 melanoma, tuberculosis and testicular

                 cancer.

                             MARLA

                 And I saw you practicing this...

                             JACK

                 Practicing what?

                             MARLA

                 Telling me off.  Is it going as well

                 as you hoped... ?

                       (reads his nametag)

                 "... Mr. Taylor."

                             JACK

                 I'll expose you.

                             MARLA

                 Go ahead.  I'll expose you.

                             LEADER

                 Share yourself completely.

     Marla puts her head down on Jack's shoulder as if she were

     crying.  Jack pulls her head back up.  She deadpans at him.

                             JACK

                 Why are you doing this?

                             MARLA

                 It's cheaper than a movie, and

                 there's free coffee.

                             JACK

                 These are my groups.  I was here

                 first.  I've been coming for a year.

                             MARLA

                 A year?  How'd you manage that?

                             JACK

                 Anyone who might've noticed either

                 died or recovered and never came back.

                             LEADER

                 Let yourself cry.

                             MARLA

                 Why do you do it?

                             JACK

                 I... I don't know.  I guess... when

                 people think you're dying, they

                 really listen, instead...

                             MARLA

                 -- Instead of just waiting for their

                 turn to speak.

                             JACK

                 Yeah.

     Brief recognition between them, broken as the Leader passes.

                             LEADER

                 Quietly, now.  Share with each other.

     Jack waits till the Leader's out of earshot.

                             JACK

                       (warning)

                 It becomes an addiction.

                             MARLA

                 Really?

     Jack sighs, then pulls back.

                             JACK

                 Look, I can't cry with a faker

                 present.

                             MARLA

                 Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not

                 my problem.

                             JACK

                 Please.  Can't we do something... ?

     Marla starts out of the room.  Jack follows her.

                             LEADER

                 Now, the closing prayer.

     EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

     Marla gets to the sidewalk, moving quickly along.

                             JACK

                 We'll split up the week.  You can

                 have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --

                             MARLA

                 You take tuberculosis.  My smoking

                 doesn't go over at all.

                             JACK

                 I think testicular cancer should be

                 no contest.

                             MARLA

                 Well, technically, I have more of a

                 right to be there than you.  You

                 still have your balls.

                             JACK

                 You're kidding.

                             MARLA

                 I don't know -- am I?

     Jack follow Marla into...

     INT. LAUNDROMAT - CONTINUOUS

     Marla walks with authority up to an unwatched DRYER.  She

     takes out clothes, picks out jeans, pants and shirts.

                             MARLA

                 I'll take the parasites.

                             JACK

                 You can't have both parasites.  You

                 can take blood parasites --

                             MARLA

                 I want brain parasites.

                             JACK

                 Okay.  I'll take blood parasites and

                 organic brain dementia --

                             MARLA

                 I want that.

                             JACK

                 You can't have the whole brain!

                             MARLA

                 So far, you have four and I only have

                 two!

                             JACK

                 Then, take blood parasites.  It's

                 yours.  Now we each have three.

     Marla gathers the chosen garments and heads out past Jack...

     EXT. SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS

     Jack follows, bewildered.

                             JACK

                 You... left half your clothes.

     HONK!  Jack starts.  Marla's led him into the street with

     traffic barreling down.

     Marla walks on, oblivious as CARS screech to a halt, HORNS

     BLARING.  Jack dashes, following...

     INT. THRIFT STORE - CONTINUOUS

     Marla drops the pile of clothes on a counter.  An old CLERK

     sifts through the clothes, begins writing on a pad.

                             JACK

                 You're selling those?

     Marla steps down hard on Jack's foot.  He winces in pain.

                             MARLA

                       (for the Clerk to hear)

                 Yes, I'm selling some chothes.

     The Clerk starts to ring up the assessed amounts.

                             MARLA

                 So, we each have three -- that's six.

                 What about the seventh day?  I want

                 ascending bowel cancer.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 The girl had done her homework.

                             JACK

                 I want ascending bowel cancer.

     The Clerk gives a strange look as he hands money to Marla.

                             MARLA

                 That's your favorite, too?  Tried to

                 slip it by me, eh?

                             JACK

                 We'll split it.  You get it the first

                 and third Sunday of the month.

                             MARLA

                 Deal.

     They shake.  Jack tries to withdraw his hand; Marla holds it.

                             MARLA

                 Looks like this is goodbye.

                             JACK

                 Let's not make a big thing out of it.

     She walks to the door, pocketing money, not looking back.

                             MARLA

                 How's this for not making a big thing?

     Jack watches her go.  A moment, then he follows after...

     EXT. SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS

     Jack hesitates, unsure, then run/walks to catch up to her...

                             JACK

                 Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange

                 numbers?

                             MARLA

                 Should we?

                             JACK

                 In case we want to switch nights.

                             MARLA

                 I suppose.

     Jack takes out a business card, writes his number on the

     back, hands it to her.  She takes the pen, grabs his hand

     and writes her number on his palm.  She walks into the

     street, causing more SCREECHING and HONKING.  She turns,

     holds up the card.

                             MARLA

                 It doesn't have your name.  Who are

                 you?  Cornelius?  Mr. Taylor?  Dr.

                 Zaius?  Any of the stupid names you

                 give each night?

     Jack starts to answer, but the traffic noise is too loud.

     Marla just shakes her head, turns, and keeps moving.  A BUS

     moves into view, obscuring her.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 This is how I met Marla Singer.

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - DAY

     The plane touches down; the cabin BUMPS.  Jack's eyes open.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 You wake up at O'Hare.

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - DAY

     Jack snaps awake again, looking around, disoriented.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 You wake up at SeaTac.

     EXT. HIGHWAY - DUSK

     The rear of a CRASHED CAR sticks up by the side of the road.

     Jack stands, marking on a clipboard.  The SUN SETS behind.

     INT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

     Jack stands at a gate counter.  An ATTENDANT smiles at him.

                             ATTENDANT

                 Check-in for that flight doesn't

                 begin for another two hours, Sir.

     Jack looks with blearing eyes at his watch, steps away and

     looks at an overhanging CLOCK.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Pacific, Mountain, Central.  Lose an

                 hour, gain an hour.  This is your

                 life, and it's ending one minute at

                 a time.

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - DAY

     Jack's eyes snap open as the plane LANDS.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 You wake up at Air Harbor

                 International.

     INT. AIRPORT WALKWAY

     Jack stands on a conveyor belt, briefcase at his feet.  He

     watches PEOPLE MOVING PAST on the opposite conveyor.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 If you wake up at a different time

                 and in a different place, could you

                 wake up as a different person?

     Jack misses seeing TYLER on the opposite conveyor belt.

     They pass each other.

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - IN FLIGHT - NIGHT

     Jack sits next to a BUSINESSMAN.  As they have idle

     CONVERSATION, we MOVE IN ON Jack's tray.  An ATTENDANT'S

     HANDS set coffee down with a small container of cream.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Everywhere I travel -- tiny life.

                 Single-serving sugar, single-serving

                 cream, single pat of butter.

                                                      CUT TO:

     HANDS place a dinner tray down.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Microwave Cordon Bleu hobby kit.

     INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Jack brushes his teeth in the MIRROR.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Shampoo/conditioner combo.  Single-

                 serving mouthwash, tiny bar of soap.

     Jack picks up an individual, wrapped Q-TIP, looks at it.  He

     moves out of the bathroom into...

     MAIN ROOM

     Jack sits on the bed.  He turns on the TV.  It's tuned to

     the "Sheraton Channel," shows WAITERS serving people in a

     large BANQUET ROOM.  Jack stops brushing his teeth, feels

     something on the bed, lifts it -- a small DINNER MINT.

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - IN FLIGHT - NIGHT

     Jack sits next to a frumpy WOMAN.  They chat.  Jack turns to

     look at his food, takes a bite.  He turns back and it's...

     --a BALD MAN next to him, talking.  Jack takes another bite,

     turns back and it's...

     --a BUSINESSMAN next to him.  Jack takes another bite, turns

     back, and it's...

     --a BUSINESS WOMAN next to him.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 The people I meet on each flight --

                 they're single-serving friends.

                 Between take-off and landing, we have

                 our time together, but that's all we

                 get.

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - LANDING

     Jack's eyes snap open.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 You wake up at Logan.

     INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     A giant corrugated METAL DOOR opens.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 On a long enough time line, the

                 survival rate for everyone drops to

                 zero.

     Two TECHNICIANS lead Jack to the BURNT-OUT SHELL of a

     WRECKED AUTOMOBILE.  Jack sets down his briefcase, opens it

     and starts to make notes on a CLIPBOARDED FORM.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 I'm a recall coordinator.  My job is

                 to apply the formula.  It's a story

                 problem.

                             TECHNICIAN #1

                 Here's where the infant went through

                 the windshield.  Three points.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 A new car built by my company leaves

                 somewhere traveling at 60 miles per

                 hour.  The rear differential locks up.

                             TECHNICIAN #2

                 The teenager's braces around the

                 backseat ashtray would make a good

                 "anti-smoking" ad.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 The car crashes and burns with

                 everyone trapped inside.  Now: do we

                 initiate a recall?

                             TECHNICIAN #1

                 The father must've been huge.  See

                 how the fat burnt into the driver's

                 seat with his polyester shirt?  Very

                 "modern art."

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Take the number of vehicles in the

                 field, (A), and multiply it by the

                 probable rate of failure, (B), then

                 multiply the result by the average

                 out-of-court settlement, (C).  A

                 times B times C equals X...

                                                      CUT TO:

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - MOVING DOWN RUNWAY

     Jack is speaking to the BUSINESSWOMAN next to him.

                             JACK

                 If X is less than the cost of a

                 recall, we don't do one.

                             BUSISNESS WOMAN

                 Are there a lot of these kinds of

                 accidents?

                             JACK

                 Oh, you wouldn't believe.

                             BUSINESS WOMAN

                 ... Which... car company do you work

                 for?

                             JACK

                 A major one.

     Turgid silence.  Jack turns to the window.  He sees a

     PELICAN get SUCKED into the TURBINE.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Every time the plane banked too

                 sharply on take-off or landing, I

                 prayed for a crash, or a mid-air

                 collision -- anything.

     Jack's face remains bland during the following: the plane

     BUCKLES -- the cabin wobbles.  People panic.  Masks drop.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 No more haircuts.  Nothing matters,

                 not even bad breath.

     The side of the plane SHEARS OFF!  Screaming PASSENGERS are

     sucked out into the night air, flying past the quivering

     wind.  Magazines and other objects fly everywhere.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Life insurance pays off triple if you

                 die on a business trip.

     Jack remains in his same position, same bland expression.

     DING! -- the seatbelt light goes OUT.  Jack SNAPS AWAKE.

     EVERYTHING IS NORMAL.  Some passengers get out of their

     seats.  From next to Jack, a VOICE we've heard before...

                             VOICE

                 There are three ways to make napalm.

                 One, mix equal parts of gasoline and

                 frozen orange juice...

     Jack turns to see TYLER.  Without turned to Jack, Tyler

     continues:

                             TYLER

                 Two, equal parts gasoline and diet

                 cola.  Three, dissolve kitty-litter

                 in gasoline until the mixture is

                 thick.

                             JACK

                 Pardon me?

     Tyler turns to Jack.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 This is how I met --

                             TYLER

                 Tyler Durden.

     Tyler offers his hand.  Jack takes it.

                             TYLER

                 You know why they have oxygen masks

                 on planes?

                             JACK

                 No, supply oxygen?

                             TYLER

                 Oxygen gets you high.  In a

                 catastrophic emergency, we're taking

                 giant, panicked breaths...

     Tyler grabs a safety instruction CARD from the seatback,

     hands it to Jack.

                             TYLER

                 Suddenly, we become euphoic and

                 docile.  We accept our fate.

     Tyler points to passive faces on the drawn figures.

                             TYLER

                 Emergency water landing, 600 miles

                 per hour.  Blank faces -- calm as

                 Hindu cows.

     Jack laughs.

                             JACK

                 What do you do, Tyler?

                             TYLER

                 What do you want me to do?

                             JACK

                 I mean -- for a living.

                             TYLER

                 Why?  So you can say, "Oh, that's

                 what you do." -- And be a smug little

                 shit about it?

     Jack laughs.  Tyler reaches under the seat in front of him

     and lifts a BRIEFCASE.

                             TYLER

                 You have a kind of sick desperation

                 in your laugh.

     Jack points to his own briefcase.

                             JACK

                 We have the same briefcase.

     Tyler turns the top of his briefcase toward Jack.

                             TYLER

                 Open it.

     Jack looks at Tyler, then pops the latches and raises the

     lid to reveal quaintly-wrapped bars of SOAP.

                             TYLER

                 Soap -- the yardstick of civilization.

                       (reaches in his pocket)

                 I make and sell soap...

     Tyler hands Jack his card.  "THE PAPER STREET SOAP COMPANY."

                             TYLER

                 If you were to add nitric acid to the

                 soap-making process, one would get

                 nitroglycerin.  With enough soap, one

                 could blow up the world, if one were

                 so inclined.

     Tyler SNAPS the briefcase shut.  Jack stares.

                             JACK

                 Tyler, you are by far the most

                 interesting "single-serving" friend

                 I've ever met.

     Tyler stares back.  Jack, enjoying his own chance to be

     witty, leans closer to Tyler.

                             JACK

                 You see, when you travel, everything

                 is small, self-contained--

                             TYLER

                 The spork.  I get it.  You're very

                 clever.

                             JACK

                 Thank you.

                             TYLER

                 How's that working out for you?

                             JACK

                 What?

                             TYLER

                 Being clever.

                             JACK

                       (thrown)

                 Well, uh... great.

                             TYLER

                 Keep it up, then.  Keep it right up.

     Tyler stands, looks towards the aisle.

                             TYLER

                 ... As I squeeze past, do I give you

                 the ass or the crotch?

     Tyler moves to the aisle, his ass toward jack, walks away...

                             TYLER

                 We are defined by the choices we make.

     Tyler goes to the curtain dividing First Class, slaps the

     curtain aside and sits in an empty seat.  Jack watches.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 How I came to live with Tyler is:

                 airlines have this policy about

                 vibrating luggage.

     INT. BAGGAGE CLAIM AREA - NIGHT

     Utterly empty of baggage.  No people except for Jack and a

     SECURITY TASK FORCE MAN.  The Security TFM, smirking, holds

     a receiver to his ear from an official phone on the wall.

                             SECURITY TFM

                       (to Jack)

                 Throwers don't worry about ticking.

                 Modern bombs don't tick.

                             JACK

                 Excuse me?  "Throwers?"

                             SECURITY TFM

                 Baggage handlers.  But when a

                 suitcase vibrates, the throwers have

                 to call the police.

                             JACK

                 My suitcase was vibrating?

                             SECURITY TFM

                 Nine time out of ten, it's an

                 electric razor.  But, every once in

                 a while ...

                       (whispers)

                 ...it's a dildo.  It's airline policy

                 not to imply ownership in the event

                 of a dildo.  We use the indefinite

                 aricle: "A dildo."  Never "Your

                 dildo."

     Jack sees, through the window, Tyler, at the curb, throwing

     his briefcase into the back of a shiny, red CONVERTIBLE.

     Tyler leaps over the door into the driver's seat and PEELS

     OUT.  jack turns away, looks at the Security TFM.

     In the background, a HARRIED MAN dashes after Tyler and the

     convertible, SCREAMING.

                             JACK

                       (to Security TFM)

                 I had everything in that bag.  My

                 C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...

                             SECURITY TFM

                       (into phone)

                 Yeah, uh huh... yeah?

                       (pause, still on phone)

                 Oh...

     EXT. EMPTY RUNWAY

     A lone SUITCASE sits on the concrete.  SECURITY PERSONNEL

     keep their distance.  KABOOM!  The suitcase explodes.

     INT. BAGGAGE CLAIM AREA - RESUMING

     The Security TFM, shakes his head, hangs up.

                             SECURITY TFM

                 I'm terribly sorry.

     The Security TFM hands Jack a claim form.  Jack snatches it,

     disgusted, takes out a pen, starts filling out the form.

                             SECURITY TFM

                 You know the industry slang for

                 "Flight Attendant?"  "Air Mattress."

     INT. TAXI - MOVING - NIGHT

     Along a residential street.  Jack looks ahead, sees a tall,

     grey, bland BUILDING on the corner.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Home was a condo on the fifteenth

                 floor of a filing cabinet for widows

                 and young professionals.  The walls

                 were solid concrete.  A foot of

                 concrete is important when your next-

                 door neighbor lets her hearing aid go

                 and has to watch game shows at full

                 volume...

     The taxi turns a corner and Jack sees the front of the

     building.  A diffuse CLOUD of SMOKE wafts away from a BLOWN-

     OUT SECTION of the fifteenth floor.  FIRETRUCKS, POLICE CARS

     and a MOB are all crowded around the lobby area.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 -- Or when a volcanic blast of debris

                 that used to be your furniture and

                 personal effects blows out your floor-

                 to-ceiling windows and sails flaming

                 into the night.

     EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF BUILDING

     Jack, gaping at the sight above him, absently gives the

     Cabbie money.  The taxi pulls away.  Jack starts toward the

     building.  He pushes through the fray of people, into the...

     INT. LOBBY

     The DOORMAN sees Jack enter, gives a sad smile, shakes his

     head.  Jack starts for the elevator.

                             DOORMAN

                 There's nothing up there.

     Jack presses the button.  The Doorman moves next to him.

                             DOORMAN

                 You can't go into the unit.  Police

                 orders.

     The elevator doors open.  Jack hesitates.  The doors close.

     Jack heads out the lobby doors.  The Doorman follows...

     EXT. CONDO BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

     Jack walks past SMOKING, CHARRED DEBRIS -- a flash of ORANGE

     from the Yang table, a CLOCK FACE from the hall clock, part

     of an arm from the GREEN ARMCHAIR.  His feet CRUNCH glass.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 How embarrassing.

                             DOORMAN

                 Do you have somebody you can call?

     Jack comes to his REFRIGERATOR lying on its side.  He

     reaches down and takes a note: "MARLA --" and a phone

     number, from under a BANANA MAGNET.

     CLOSE SHOT - JACK'S STOVE

     Hissing.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 The police would later tell me that

                 the pilot light might have gone

                 out... letting out just a little bit

                 of gas.

     EXT. PAYPHONE - RESUMING

     Jack gets to a PAYPHONE.  The Doorman follows, watching him.

                             DOORMAN

                 Lots of young people try to impress

                 the world and buy too many things.

     Jack picks up the receiver, puts in a quarter.  He looks at

     Marla's number a long moment.

     CLOSE SHOT - JACK'S ENTIRE CONDO - KITCHEN AND LIVING ROOM

     The SOUND of the HISS...

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 The gas could have slowly filled the

                 condo.  Seventeen-hundred square feet

                 with high ceilings, for days and days.

     EXT. PAYPHONE - RESUMING

     Jack replaces the receiver.  He pockets Marla's number, digs

     out a small FILOFAX.  He flips through the pages for phone

     numbers and addresses.  Most of the pages are blank.

                             DOORMAN

                 Many young people feel trapped and

                 desperate.

     INSERT - CLOSE ON THE BASE OF JACK'S REFRIGERATOR

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Then, the refrigerator's compressor

                 could have clicked on...

     Click.  KABOOM!  SCREEN GOES WHITE.

     EXT. PAYPHONE - RESUMING

     Jack looks at the Doorman.  Tyler's BUSINESS CARD falls from

     the Filofax.  Jack catches it.

                             DOORMAN

                 If you don't know what you want, you

                 end up with a lot you don't.

     The Doorman walks away.  Jack stares at Tyler's card.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 If you asked me now, I couldn't tell

                 you why I called him.

     Jack re-deposits the quarter, dials Tyler's number.  It

     RINGS... and RINGS and RINGS.  Jack sighs and hangs up the

     phone.  A moment, then the phone RINGS.

                             JACK

                 Hello?

                             TYLER'S VOICE

                 Who's this?

                             JACK

                 Tyler?

                             TYLER'S VOICE

                 Who's this?

                             JACK

                 Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the

                 plane.  We had the same briefcase.

                 I'm... you know, the clever guy.

                             TYLER'S VOICE

                 Oh, yeah.

                             JACK

                 I just called a second ago.  There

                 was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.

                             TYLER'S VOICE

                 I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick

                 up my phone.  What's up?

                             JACK

                 Well... let me see... here's the

                 thing...

     EXT. LOU'S TAVERN - NIGHT

     A small building in the middle of a concrete parking lot.

     INT. LOU'S TAVERN - SAME

     Jack and Tyler sit in the back, with a pitcher of BEER.

                             JACK

                 You buy furniture.  You tell

                 yourself: this is the last sofa I'll

                 ever need.  No matter what else

                 happens, I've got the sofa issue

                 handled.  Then, the right set of

                 dishes.  The right dinette.

                             TYLER

                 This is how we fill up our lives.

     Tyler lights a cigarette.

                             JACK

                 I guess so.

                             TYLER

                 And, now it's gone.

                             JACK

                 All gone.

     Tyler offers cigarettes.  Jack declines.

                             TYLER

                 Could be worse.  A woman could cut

                 off your penis while you're asleep

                 and toss it out the window of a

                 moving car.

                             JACK

                 There's always that.

                             TYLER

                 I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe

                 it's a terrible tragedy.

                             JACK

                 ...no ...no ...

                             TYLER

                 I mean, you did lose a lot of nice,

                 neat little shit.  The trendy paper

                 lamps, the Euro-trash shelving unit,

                 am I right?

     Jack laughs, nods.  He shakes his head, drinks.

                             TYLER

                 But maybe, just maybe, you've been

                 delivered.

                             JACK

                       (toasts)

                 Delivered from Swedish furniture.

                             TYLER

                 Delivered from armchairs in obscure

                 green stripe patterns.

                             JACK

                 Delivered from Martha Stewart.

                             TYLER

                 Delivered from bullshit colors like

                 "Cobalt," "Ebony," and "Fuchsia."

     They laugh together.  Then, silence.  They drink.

                             JACK

                 Insurance'll cover it.

                             TYLER

                 Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the

                 list.

                             JACK

                 What list?

                             TYLER

                 The "now I get to go out and buy the

                 exact same stuff all over again"

                 list.  That list.

                             JACK

                 I don't... think so.

                             TYLER

                 This time maybe get a widescreen TV.

                 You'll be occupied for weeks.

                             JACK

                 Well, I have to file a claim...

                             TYLER

                 The things you own, they end up

                 owning you.

                             JACK

                 Don't I?

                             TYLER

                 Do what you like.

                             JACK

                       (looks at watch)

                 God, it's late.  I should find a

                 hotel...

                             TYLER

                 A hotel?

                             JACK

                 Yeah.

                             TYLER

                 So, you called me up, because you

                 just wanted to have a drink before

                 you... go find a hotel?

                             JACK

                 I don't follow...

                             TYLER

                 We're on our third pitcher of beer.

                 Just ask me.

                             JACK

                 Huh?

                             TYLER

                 You called me so you could have a

                 place to stay.

                             JACK

                 No, I...

                             TYLER

                 Why don't you cut the shit and ask if

                 you can stay at my place?

                             JACK

                 Would that be a problem?

                             TYLER

                 Is it a problem for you to ask?

                             JACK

                 Can I stay at your place?

                             TYLER

                 Yes, you can.

                             JACK

                 Thank you.

                             TYLER

                 You're welcome.  But, I want you to

                 do me one favor.

                             JACK

                 What's that?

                             TYLER

                 I want you to hit me as hard as you

                 can.

                             JACK

                 What?

                             TYLER

                 I want you to hit me as hard as you

                 can.

     Freeze picture.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Let me tell you a little bit about

                 Tyler Durden.

     EXTREME CLOSE-UP - FILM FRAME

     -- And we see it's PORNOGRAPHY.

     INT. PROJECTIONIST ROOM - THEATRE - NIGHT

     Jack, in the foreground, FACES CAMERA.  In the BACKGROUND,

     Tyler sits at a bench, looking at individual FRAMES cut from

     movies.  Near him, a PROJECTOR rolls film.

                             JACK

                 Tyler was a night person.  He

                 sometimes worked as a projectionist.

                 A movie doesn't come in one big reel,

                 it's on a few.  In old theaters, two

                 projectors are used, so someone has

                 to change projectors at the exact

                 second when one reel ends and

                 another reel begins.  Sometimes you

                 can see two dots on screen in the

                 upper right hand corner...

     Tyler points to the side of OUR FRAME and the TWO DOTS

     briefly APPEAR ONSCREEN.

                             TYLER

                 They're called "cigarette burns."

                             JACK

                 It's called a "changeover."  The

                 movie goes on, and nobody in the

                 audience has any idea.

                             TYLER

                 Why would anyone want this shitty job?

                             JACK

                 It affords him other interesting

                 opportunities.

                             TYLER

                 -- Like splicing single frames from

                 adult movies into family films.

                             JACK

                 In reel three, right after the

                 courageous dog and the snooty cag --

                 who have celebrity voices -- eat out

                 of a garbage can, there's the flash

                 of Tyler's contribution...

     In the AUDIENCE, CHILDREN suddenly start squirming,

     confused, looking at each other.

     A WOMAN abruptly stops sucking her soda straw, feeling

     vaguely terrible.  Her uncomfortable HUSBAND slowly leans

     back in his seat.

     Jack and Tyler watch from the projection booth window.

                             TYLER

                 One-forty-eighth of a second.  That's

                 how long it's up there.

                             JACK

                 No one really knows that they've seen it.

                 But they did.

                             TYLER

                 A nice, big cock.

                             JACK

                 Only a hummingbird could have caught

                 Tyler at work.

     INT. LARGE BANQUET HALL - NIGHT

     Tyler moves around one of many tables, setting down SOUP

     BOWLS.  Jack stands in the same position, FACING CAMERA.

                             JACK

                 Tyler also worked as a banquet waiter

                 at the luxurious Pressman Hotel.

     The GUESTS command the WAITERS with snaps of fingers.

     INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - NIGHT

     Jack turns and WE PAN to Tyler, standing by a CART with a

     giant SOUP TUREEN.  His hands are at his open fly and he's

     in position to piss into the soup.

                             JACK

                 He was the guerrilla terrorist of the

                 food service industry.

                             TYLER

                 Don't watch.  I can't if you watch.

     Jack waits.  The SOUND of a STREAM of LIQUID is HEARD.

                             TYLER

                 ... Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.

                             JACK

                 He farted on meringue; he sneezed on

                 braised endive; and, with creme of

                 mushroom soup, well...

                             TYLER (O.S.)

                 Go ahead.  Say it.

                             JACK

                 You get the idea.

     EXT. PARKING LOT OF TAVERN - RESUMING

     Tyler and Jack come out the back door.

                             JACK

                 I don't know about this.

                             TYLER

                 I don't know, either.  I want to find

                 out.  I've never been hit, have you?

                             JACK

                 No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?

                             TYLER

                 I don't want to die without any

                 scars.  How much can you really know

                 about yourself if you've never been

                 in a fight?  Come on... you're the

                 only person I've ever asked.

                             JACK

                 Me?

     Jack stares at him.

                             TYLER

                 Why not you?  I'm letting you go

                 first.  Do it.

                             JACK

                 This is crazy.

                             TYLER

                 Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.

                             JACK

                 Where do you want it?  In the face?

                             TYLER

                 Surprise me.

     Jack swings a wide, clumsy roundhouse -- hits Tyler's

     neck -- makes a dull, flat sound.

                             JACK

                 Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count.

                             TYLER

                 Like hell.  That counted.

     Tyler shoots out a straight punch to Jack's chest.  Jack

     falls back against a car.  His eyes tear up.

                             TYLER

                 How do you feel?

                             JACK

                 Strange.

                             TYLER

                 But a good strange.

                             JACK

                 Is it?

                             TYLER

                 We've crossed the threshold.  You

                 want to call it off?

                             JACK

                 Call what off?

                             TYLER

                 The fight.

                             JACK

                 What fight?

                             TYLER

                 This fight, pussy.

     Jack swings another roundhouse that slams right under

     Tyler's ear.  Tyler punches Jack in the stomach.  Tyler and

     Jack move clumsily, throwing punches.  They breathe heavier,

     drooling saliva and blood, growing dizzier from every impact.

     EXT. CURBSIDE - LATER

     Jack and Tyler sit on the curb, watching sparse headlights

     on the nearby freeway.  Their eyes are glazed with endorphin-

     induced serenity.  They look at each other, laugh.  Look away.

                             TYLER

                 If you could fight anyone... one on

                 one, whoever you wanted, who would

                 you fight?

                             JACK

                 Anyone?

                             TYLER

                 Anyone.

     Jack thinks.

                             JACK

                 My boss, probably.

                       (pause)

                 Who would you fight?

                             TYLER

                 My dad.  No question.

     A long pause as Jack studies Tyler's face.

                             JACK

                 Oh, yeah.

                       (nodding)

                 I didn't know my dad.  Well, I knew

                 him, till I was six.  He went and

                 married another woman, had more kids.

                 Every six years or so he'd do it

                 again -- new city, new family.

                             TYLER

                 He was setting up franchises.  My

                 father never went to college, so it

                 was really important that I go.

                             JACK

                 I know that.

                             TYLER

                 After I graduated, I called him long

                 distance and asked, "Now what?"  He

                 said, "Get a job."  When I turned

                 twenty-five, I called him and asked,

                 "Now what?"  He said, "I don't know.

                 Get married."

                             JACK

                 Same here.

                             TYLER

                 A generation of men raised by women.

                 I'm wondering if another woman is the

                 answer we really need.

     Another pause.  Jack feels his bleeding lip, smiles.

                             JACK

                 We should do this again sometime.

     Tyler cracks a smile, give a sidelong glance to Jack.

     EXT. PAPER STREET - NIGHT

     A street sign: "PAPER STREET."  A PAPER MILL stis on one

     side, facing a lone HOUSE on the other.  The rest of the

     land is grass and weeds.  It's a grand, old three-story,

     long abandoned.  Tyler leads Jack toward it.

                             JACK

                 Where's your car?

                             TYLER

                 What car?

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 I don't know how Tyler found the

                 house, but he'd been there for half

                 a year.

     INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - ENTRANCE -- NIGHT

     Tyler leads Jack through the FRONT DOOR...

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 It looked like it was waiting to be

                 torn down.  Most of the windows were

                 boarded up.

     INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENT LATER

     Tyler and Jack climb CREAKY STAIRS to the 2ND FLOOR LANDING.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 None of the doors locked.  The stairs

                 were ready to collapse.  I didn't

                 know if he owned it or he was

                 squatting.

     Tyler opens the door to a ROOM...

     INT. ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Jack enters, stis on the creaky BED.  Dust drifts upwards.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Neither would have surprised me.

     INT. SHOWER - MORNING

     Jack turns on the water.  LOUD VIBRATIONS from the walls.

     Water spits in starts.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Nothing worked.  The rusty plumbing

                 leaked.  Turning on a light meant

                 another light in the house went out.

     EXT. LOU'S TAVERN PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     All the tavern's lights are off.  Tyler and Jack FIGHT.

     FIVE GUYS stand around watching.

     INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

     Jack, his face showing NEW BRUISES AND CUTS, makes coffee

     with a wire-mesh strainer.  Tyler shuffles in, wearing a

     flannel bathrobe.  He spears pieces of bread on a fork,

     starts roasting them over a burner.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 There were no neighbors.  Just

                 warehouses and the paper mill.  The

                 fart smell of steam, the hamster cage

                 smell of wood chips.

     EXT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - NIGHT

     Jack sits watching as Tyler SWINGS an old GOLF CLUB --

     THWACK -- sends a golf ball soaring down the desolate street.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 At night, Tyler and I were alone for

                 half a mile in every direction.

     EXT. LOU'S TAVERN PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     All the lights are off.  TEN GUYS YELL, standing around Jack

     and Tyler, who FIGHT.  THREE CARS are parked in the lot.

     INT. BASEMENT - DAY

     Jack sits on basement stairs, watching as Tyler, knee-deep

     in water, works at an open FUSEBOX, flipping breakers in a

     certain order, showing Jack how it's done.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 When it rained, we had to kill the

                 power.  By the end of the first

                 month, I didn't care about TV.  I

                 didn't mind the warm, stale

                 refrigerator.

     INT. READING ROOM - NIGHT

     CANDLES BURN.  Tyler and Jack are seated across from each

     other on the buckled floor, reading MAGAZINES.  Rain DRIPS

     from the ceiling.  No furniture.  THOUSANDS of MAGAZINES.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 The previous occupant had been a bit

                 of a shut-in.

                             TYLER

                       (of magazine)

                 Hum.

                             JACK

                 What?

                             TYLER

                 Oh, a new riot control grenade...

                       (reading)

                 "...the successful combination of

                 concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash-

                 blasts and simultaneous high-velocity

                 disbursement of...blah, blah, blah..."

     Tyler begins RIPPING the ARTICLE from his magazine.

                             JACK

                       ("Reader's Digest")

                 "I am Joe's Lungs."  It's written in

                 first person.  "Without me, Joe could

                 not take in oxygen to feed his red

                 blood cells."  There's a whole

                 series -- "I am Joe's Prostate."

                             TYLER

                 "I get cancer, and I kill Joe."

     Tyler tosses his article in a pile of other articles,

     chooses another magazine.

                             JACK

                 What are you reading?

                             TYLER

                 Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week.

                 New Republic.

                             JACK

                 Show-off.

     EXT. LOU'S TAVERN PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     All the lights are off.  Jack and Tyler stand amidst FIFTEEN

     GUYS around TWO GUYS FIGHTING.  The crowd YELLS MORE WILDLY

     than before.  In the background are EIGHT PARKED CARS.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 I should have been haggling with my

                 insurance company.  I should have

                 been looking for a new condo...

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     Jack walks along.  He stops, looking at a CHURCH with

     SUPPORT-GROUP-PEOPLE milling around the entrance, drinking

     coffee and sodas.  Marla's there, amongst them, smoking.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 .... I should have been upset about

                 my nice, neat, flaming little shit.

     Jack's face shows no reaction.  He continues to walk.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 But I wasn't.

     INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

     Jack, in work clothes, interlocks his fingers and POPS his

     knuckles, picks up a saucepan with coffee and sips.  Tyler,

     in waiter's uniform, comes to have Jack straighten his tie.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Most of the week, we were Ozzie and

                 Harriet.

     Jack picks up his briefcase and walks out the door.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 But, Wednesday night, ever Wednesday

                 night...

     EXT. LOU'S TAVERN PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     All the lights are off.  No one around, but there are at

     least TWENTY-FIVE CARS parked in the full lot.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 ... we were finding something out: we

                 were finding out, more and more, that

                 we were not alone.

     INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

     A SLIDE SHOW progresses, run by a chipper salesman, WALTER.

     Jack sits, deadpan, with a PUFFY LIP and a BRUISED cheek.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Thursday mornings, all I could do was

                 think about next week.

     Boss gives Jack a dubious look.  Walter's next SLIDE: a

     COMPUTER SCREEN.

                             WALTER

                 The basic premise of cyber-netting

                 your office is -- make things more

                 efficient.

                             BOSS

                 Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?

                             WALTER

                 Absolutely.

     Walter continues, his sales pitch drowned out by Jack's V.O.:

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Walter, the Microsoft account exec.

                 Walter, with his smooth, soft hands.

                 Maybe he was thinking about the free-

                 range potluck he'd been to last

                 weekend, or his church-group car-wash

                 fund-raiser.  Or, probably not.

     Walter moves to Jack and slaps him in the shoulder.

                             WALTER

                 I showed this already to my man here.

                 You liked it, didn't you?

     Jack smiles.  His teeth are RED with BLOOD.  They GLOW

     eerily in the dim light.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 You can swallow a pint of blood

                 before you get sick.

                             WALTER

                 Jesus, I'd hate to see what happened

                 to the other guy.

     Jack keeps the smile frozen on his face.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Screw Walter.  His candy-ass wouldn't

                 last a second Wednesday night.

     EXT. LOU'S TAVERN - NIGHT

     Out of silent darkness, HEADLIGHTS appear from all

     directions.  CARS PULL UP and park in the already-packed

     lot.  YOUNG MEN get out and march into the tavern...

     INT. LOU'S TAVERN - SAME

     The men, including Jack and Tyler, enter and stand against

     the back wall, waiting.  The bartender, IRVINE, calls out:

                             IRVINE

                 Drink up people.  We're closing.

     Irvine flicks on the LIGHTS.  Drunken customers squint and

     get the message.  They plop down money, leaving.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 It was right in everyone's face.

                 Tyler and I just made it visible.

     Irvine hits a button and the JUKEBOX loses power.  Members

     of the waiting army begins to share secret looks.  Finally,

     one buy locks the door.  Two other guys close the blinds.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 It was on the tip of everyone's

                 tongue.  Tyler and I just gave it a

                 name.

     INT. TAVERN BASEMENT - SAME

     A BOMB-SHELTER.  Concrete walls.  One BARE BULB above, Tyler

     standing directly beneath it.

                             TYLER

                 Welcome to fight club.

     The guys mill around, finding partners.  Everyone brims with

     eagerness, but tries to act cool.  CHATTER gets LOUDER.

     Everyone spreads out, forming a circle, Tyler at center.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Every week, Tyler gave the rules that

                 he and I decided.

     PEAKING CHATTER, till Tyler raises his arms and the CHATTER

     DIES.  A couple of COUGHS, FEET SHUFFLING, then, SILENCE.

                             TYLER

                 The first rule of fight club is --

                 you don't talk about fight club.  The

                 second rule of fight club is -- you

                 don't talk about fight club.  The

                 third rule of fight club is -- when

                 someone says "stop" or goes limp, the

                 fight is over.  Fourth rule is --

                 only two guys to a fight.  Fifth

                 rule -- one fight at a time.  Sixth

                 rule -- no shirts, no shoes.  Seventh

                 rule -- fights go on as long as they

                 have to.  And the eighth and final

                 rule -- if this is your first night

                 at fight club, you have to fight.

     Tyler steps back.  A short guy, RICKY, and a GOATEED MAN

     take off shirts and shoes and step to the center.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 This kid, Ricky -- supply clerk --

                 couldn't remember whether you ordered

                 pens with blue ink or black ink ...

     The two fighters circle, then begin throwing PUNCHES...

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 But Ricky was a god for ten minutes

                 last week when he trounced an actuary

                 twice his size.

     Harder, faster PUNCHES between the two.  SWEAT flies.

     SHOUTS become DEAFENING.  Ricky's getting the best of

     Goateed Man, POUNDING him...

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Sometimes all you could hear were

                 flat, hard packing sounds over the

                 yelling, or the wet choke when

                 someone caught their breath and

                 sprayed...

                             GOATEED MAN

                       (spittle-lipped)

                 Ssssstop... !

     INT. OFFICE PARK RESTAURANT - DAY

     Jack, eating lunch, watches the BROKEN-NOSED WAITER with a

     GOATEE -- from the above fight -- converse with a MAITRE D'.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Even if I could tell someone they had

                 a good fight, I wouldn't be talking

                 to the same man.

     The Goateed Waiter approaches Jack and sets a refill soda

     down on the table.  The two of them briefly make eye contact.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Who you were in fight club is not who

                 you were in the rest of the world.

     INT. PHOTOCOPY ROOM - DAY

     Jack stands over a copy machine, hit by flashes of light.

     He glances over his shoulder, watches Ricky, wearing an

     apron, push a supply cart.  Ricks nods at Jack.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 You weren't alive anywhere like you

                 were there.  But fight club only

                 exists in the hours between when

                 fight club starts and when fight club

                 ends.

     INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY

     Jack, playing SOLITAIRE on his computer, daubs blood from

     his mouth with a handkerchief.  Boss, passing by the

     doorway, looks in at Jack, irritated.

                             BOSS

                 What are you getting yourself into

                 every week?

     Jack keeps playing Solitaire.  Boss enters, folds his arms.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 After fight club, everything else in

                 your life gets the volume turned

                 down.  You can deal with anything.

                             BOSS

                 Have you finished those reports?

                             JACK

                       (handing him reports)

                 Yes.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 The people who had power over you

                 have less and less.

     Jack looks at Boss.  Reflexively, Jack's tongue plays with

     his teeth.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 By this point, I could wiggle most of

                 the teeth in my jaw.

     EXT. STREET - DUSK

     Tyler and Jack walk, both smoking cigarettes.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 A guy came to fight club for the

                 first time, his ass was a wad of

                 cookie dough.  After a few weeks, he

                 was carved out of wood.

                             JACK

                 If you could fight any celebrity?

                             TYLER

                 Alive or dead?

                             JACK

                 Doesn't matter.

                             TYLER

                 Hemingway.  You?

                             JACK

                 Shatner.  William Shatner.

     They reach a BUS STOP as a BUS arrives, tossing their

     cigarettes, getting on board...

     INT. BUS - DUSK

     The bus is crowded.  As Tyler and Jack walk toward the back,

     Jack studies the faces of OTHER PASSENGERS...

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 We all started seeing things

                 differently.  Wherever we went.

     They hold hand grips.  Jack looks up at an ADVERTISEMENT; a

     CALVIN KLEIN ad featuring a tan, bare-chested MUSCLE STUD.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 I felt sorry for all the guys packing

                 into gyms, trying to look like what

                 Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger said

                 they should.

     Tyler looks at Jack, looks at the C.K. advertisement.

                             TYLER

                 Self-improvement is masturbation.

                 Self-destruction is the answer.

     A MAN in a suit KNOCKS Tyler's shoulder as he passes.  The

     Man takes a handle, close by.  Jack's pissed, staring at the

     man, who stares back.

                             JACK

                       (to Tyler, so the

                        Man can hear)

                 You could take him.

     Tyler looks to Jack, glances over his shoulder at the Man.

     Tyler casually picks a small scab off Jack's nostril.

                             TYLER

                 The trick is not to care.

     Tyler stares forward.

     INT. TAVERN BASEMENT - NIGHT

     Tyler HITS the floor, stomach first.  HIS OPPONENT lands on

     top of him, grappling, trying for a CHOKE HOLD.  The

     surrounding CROWD, Jack included, SCREAMS at them...

     Tyler and the Opponent wrestle desperately, and Tyler flips

     his attacker, gets on top, sprawling to pin him.  Tyler

     turns -- starts reining PUNCHES into the Opponent's GROIN...

                                                      CUT TO:

     Jack lands a couple of BLOWS to HIS OPPONENT'S stomach --

     brings up a left uppercut that smashes the Opponent's jaw.

     Tiny spatters of BLOOD adorn the walls, along with sweat.

     Jack catches sight of a swollen-faced Tyler, watching

     appreciatively, a smile growing slowly on his face.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Fight club wasn't about winning or

                 losing.  It wasn't about words.

     The Opponent recovers, throws a headlock on Jack.  Jack

     snakes his arm into a counter headlock.  They wrestle like

     wild animals.  The crowd CHEERS maniacally.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 They hysterical shouting was in

                 tongues, like at a Pentecostal church.

     Onlookers kneel to stay with the fight, cheering LOUDER.

     The Opponent SMASHES Jack's head to the floor, over and over.

                             JACK

                 ... stop...

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 When the fight was over, nothing was

                 solved, but nothing mattered.

     Everyone moves in as the Opponent steps away.  Tyler pushes

     through the crowd.  Others lift Jack up.  They turn their

     attention to the floor, to a BLOOD MASK of Jack's face --

     similar to the TEAR MASK on BOB'S SHIRT.

                             TYLER

                 Cool.

     Jack limply shakes his Opponent's hand.

                             OPPONENT

                 How about next week?

                             JACK

                 Look at me.  How about next month?

     Everyone helps Jack walk.  He's sweating, bleeding, smiling.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Afterwards, we all felt saved.

     INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

     A NURSE tends to Jack while Tyler watches.

                             TYLER

                 He fell down some stairs.

     The Nurse doesn't look at Tyler, just keeps tending to Jack.

                             JACK

                 I fell down some stairs.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Sometimes Tyler spoke for me.

     INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING

     Tyler and Jack share the cracked MIRROR.  Tyler's clipping

     at his hair with blunt, ill-suited SCISSORS.  Jack's

     brushing his teeth, spitting out pink foam.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Fight club became the reason to cut

                 your hair short and trim your

                 fingernails.

                             TYLER

                 Any historical figure.

                             JACK

                 Okay... Ghandi.

                             TYLER

                 Good answer.

                             JACK

                 You?

                             TYLER

                 Abe Lincoln.  Big reach.  Skinny guys

                 fight till they're burger.

     Jack reaches in his mouth, exploring, pulls -- yanks a

     TOOTH.  Jack looks at it.  Tyler puts scissors down, done.

                             TYLER

                 Remember, even the Mona Lisa's

                 falling apart.

     Jack drops the tooth in the sink with Tyler's hair.

     INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON

     Jack enters, buttoning his shirt.  The PHONE RINGS.

                             JACK

                 Hello?

     INTERCUT WITH...

     INT. MARLA'S BUILDING, HALLWAY - SAME

     Marla's in the HALL, on the PAYPHONE, twisting the phone

     cord around her neck.

                             MARLA

                 Where have you been the last few

                 weeks?

                             JACK

                 Marla?

     Jack looks through the archway and sees Tyler, in his gummy

     flannel bathrobe, doing sit-ups.  Jack leans, cups the phone.

                             JACK

                       (quietly)

                 How did you find me?

                             MARLA

                 The forwarding number.  I haven't

                 seen you at any support groups.

                             JACK

                 That's the idea -- we split them.

                             MARLA

                 You haven't been going to yours.

                             JACK

                 I found a new one.

                             MARLA

                 Really?

                             JACK

                 It's for men.

                             MARLA

                 Like testicular cancer?

                             JACK

                 Look, this is a bad time...

                             MARLA

                 I've been going to debtor's

                 anonymous.  You want to see some

                 truly fucked up people?

                             JACK

                 I'm just on my way out...

                             MARLA

                 Me too.  I got a stomach full of

                 Xanax.  I took what was left of a

                 bottle.  Might've been too much.

     Jack looks exasperated, turns TO LOOK INTO THE CAMERA.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Picture yourself watching Marla

                 Singer throw herself around her

                 crummy apartment.

                             MARLA

                 This isn't a for-real suicide thing.

                 This is probably one of those cry-for-

                 help things.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 This could go on for hours.

                             JACK

                 So you're staying in tonight?

                             MARLA

                 Do you want to wait to hear me

                 describe death?

     Jack puts the handset on top of the phone, still off the

     hook, walks out the back door.

                             MARLA'S VOICE

                 Do you want to listen and see if my

                 spirit can use the telephone?

     Thru the archway: Tyler leans to look in, curious.

     INT. BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

     GRUNTS of PLEASURE and EXERTION.  Glimpses of TORSOS, ASSES,

     LEGS, ARMS, BREASTS, and FEMALE HAIR, all DRENCHED in SWEAT.

     Sheets RIP.  Bodies hit the FLOOR.  Insane GRUNTING and

     LAUGHING.  A flash of MARLA'S FACE.

                                                      CUT TO:

     INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - SUNRISE

     Jack sits up in bed, looks around the room.

     INT. 2ND FLOOR LANDING

     Jack steps out of his room.  The neighboring door is closed.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Tyler's door was closed.  I'd been

                 living here two months, and Tyler's

                 door was never closed.

     INT. BATHROOM - SAME

     Jack stares into the TOILER, looking at SIX USED CONDOMS.

     INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

     Jack sits at the table, sips coffee, read Reader's Digest.

     He hears FOOTSTEPS approaching.

                             JACK

                 You're not going to believe what I

                 dreamt last night.

     Marla walks in, straightening her dress, looks like she's

     been raped by a hurricane.  Jack's jaw drops.

                             MARLA

                 I can hardly believe anything about

                 last night.

     Marla goes to pour coffee.  She takes a swig, GARGLES and

     SPITS it in the sink.  She gives Jack a lascivious smile.

                             JACK

                 What are you doing here?

                             MARLA

                 What... ?

                             JACK

                 What the hell are you doing here?

     Marla stares at him a beat, then drops the cup in the sink.

                             MARLA

                 Fuck you.

     Marla shoves open the door to the backyard and walks out.

     Jack gets up, watches her stomp away.

     Jack turns and -- Tyler is at his shoulder, staring after

     Marla.  He's in his usual sweatpants.  He grins at Jack,

     then moves away, pours himself coffee.  Jack, smoldering,

     slumps at the table and picks up Reader's Digest.  Tyler

     puts his foot on a countertop, does stretching exercises.

                             TYLER

                 She's a piece of work.  Get this --

                 I come in here last night, the

                 phone's off the hook...

     Jack pretends to read, quickly glances at Tyler.  TYLER'S

     VOICE FADES...

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 I already knew the story before he

                 told it to me.

     INT. KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON (FLASHBACK)

     Tyler enters, gently lifts the handset and listens.

                             MARLA'S VOICE

                       (from handset)

                 I'll tell you when I'm floating out

                 of my body.

     Tyler smiles.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 How could Tyler, off all people, think

                 it was a bad thing that Marla Singer

                 was about to die?

     INT. MARLA'S - 8TH FLOOR LANDING - LATE AFTERNOON (FLASHBACK)

     Tyler, a wry smile on his face, ambles up the stiars,

     looking at the rotting walls.  He reaches the top of the

     stairs and heads for Marla's room.  Before he can knock,

     Marla's hand shoots out and grabs him...

     INT. MARLA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK)

     Marla pulls Tyler inside and shuts the door.  Her drugged

     eyes look him over.

                             MARLA

                 You got here fast.

     She staggers and sits on the bed.  She slides off, along

     with the blanket and sheets, to the floor.

                             MARLA

                 The mattresses are all sealed in

                 slippery plastic.

     She tries to focus her eyes on Tyler.

                             MARLA

                 Did I call you?

     Tyler studies her with cynical curiosity, looks at a DILDO

     lying atop a dresser.  Marla follows his gaze.

                             MARLA

                 Don't worry.  It's not a threat to you.

     SIRENS and vehicles SCREECHING outside can be HEARD; doors

     opening and SLAMMING; running FOOTFALLS.

                             MARLA

                 Oh, no!  Somebody called the cops...

     She gets to her feet, grabs Tyler, pulls him out the door.

     INT. HALLWAY (FLASHBACK)

     Marla LOCKS her door, then pulls Tyler toward the STAIRCASE.

     COPS and PARAMEDICS charge up with oxygen and medical kits.

     Marla and Tyler flatten against the wall to let them pass.

                             COP

                 8-G!  Where's 8-G?

                             MARLA

                       (pointing)

                 End of the hall.

     The rescuers keep running.

                             MARLA

                       (calling after)

                 The girl who lives there used to be

                 a charming, lovely girl, but she's

                 lost faith in herself...

                             COP

                 Miss Singer, let us help you!  You

                 have every reason to live!

     Marla yanks Tyler's arm, heading down the stairs.

                             MARLA

                 She's a monster!  Infectious human

                 waste!  Good luck trying to save her!

     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

     Tyler makes coffee.  Marla slouches against the refrigerator.

                             MARLA

                 If I fall asleep, I'm done for.

                 You're gonna have to keep me up all

                 night.

     INT. KITCHEN - MORNING (RESUMING)

     Tyler chuckles, shakes his head.

                             TYLER

                 Unbelievable, huh?

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 He was obviously able to handle it.

     Tyler stands across from Jack, gets a cigarette from a pack.

                             TYLER

                 I mean, this girl... uh, you're not

                 into her or anything... ?

                             JACK

                 No.  Not at all.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 I am Jack's Raging Bile Duct.

     Tyler lights his cigarette.

                             TYLER

                 You're sure?

                             JACK

                 Yeah, I'm sure.

                             TYLER

                 Good.  This chick was up on the table

                 with her legs in the stirrups before

                 the doctor even walked in the room.

                 The things that she said... I've

                 never heard a woman talk like that...

     INT. TYLER'S ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

     Tyler smokes, post-coital.  Marla puts her lips to his ear.

                             MARLA

                       (whispering)

                 I want to have your abortion.

     INT. KITCHEN - MORNING (RESUMING)

     Tyler laughs, shakes his head.  Jack's gripping his Reader's

     Digest just a little too tight.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 How could Tyler not go for that?

                 Night before last, he was splicing

                 sex organs into "Little Mermaid."

     Tyler sits, studies Jack's face.

                             TYLER

                 You're okay with this?

                             JACK

                 I'm fine.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Put a gun to my head and paint the

                 wall with my brains.

     Tyler smokes.

                             TYLER

                 She is a wild, twisted bitch.  Stay

                 away from that one.

                             JACK

                 Oh, and my pace is more librarians.

                             TYLER

                 Hey... don't knock librarians.

                             JACK

                 Marla doesn't need a lover.  She

                 needs a case worker.

                             TYLER

                 She needs an exorcist.  This isn't

                 love.  This is sport-fucking.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 She'd invaded my support groups, now

                 she's invading my home.

                             TYLER

                 Listen... do me a favor... sit here

                 a minute...

     Tyler pulls out a closer chair, motions to it.  Jack puts

     down his Reader's Digest and moves to that chair.

                             JACK

                 What?

                             TYLER

                 You've gotta understand something

                 about me.  I have a little rule,

                 okay?  Don't ever talk to her about

                 me.  Ever.  I can't stand that kind

                 of shit.

     Tyler fixes Jack with a friendly, but firm stare.

                             TYLER

                 If you ever say anything about me or

                 about what happens here in this

                 house, to her or anyone -- I will

                 find out.  And you'll never see me

                 again.  Promise me.

                             JACK

                 Okay.

                             TYLER

                 Promise you won't.

                             JACK

                 Yes, I promise.

                             TYLER

                 Promise?

                             JACK

                 I said I promise!

                             TYLER

                 That was three times you promised.

     Tyler smiles, gets up and leaves.  Jack sits smoldering.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 If only I had wasted a couple of

                 minutes and gone to watch Marla die,

                 none of this would have happened.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

     Jack watches TV at HIGH VOLUME.  SOUNDS of SEX from upstairs.

     INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Jack lies calmly on his bed, staring at the ceiling.  Sounds

     of THUMPS and CRASHES from beyond the wall.

                             MARLA'S VOICE

                       (muffled through wall)

                 Miserable fucking discharge!

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 I could've moved to another room, one

                 on the third floor -- so I wouldn't

                 have heard them.  But I didn't.

     INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

     SOUNDS of RAIN.  Jack flips FUSES off, then walks upstairs.

     INT. 2ND FLOOR LANDING - SAME

     Jack walks, HEARS Marla SCREAM in orgasm.  He reaches the

     landing.  Tyler's door is ajar.  Jack peeks in...

     Marla's legs are sprawled on the bed.  The door PUSHES OPEN

     WIDER -- Tyler, naked, stands CLOSE TO CAMERA.

                             TYLER

                 What are you doing?

     Jack steps back.

                             JACK

                 I... uh... just going to bed.

     Tyler scratches his head, wears a RUBBER GLOVE.

                             TYLER

                 You want to finish her off?

                             JACK

                 Uh... nah...

     Jack continues toward his room.

     INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Jack brushes his teeth.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 I became the calm, little center of

                 the world.  I was the Zen master.

     CLOSE UP - COMPUTER MONITOR

     Haiku is BEING TYPED in a trendy, italicized font.

                              "Worker bees can leave

                               Even drones can fly away

                               The queen is their slave"

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 I wrote little haiku poems.

     INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY

     Jack's clothes are PERMANENTLY STAINED with BLOOD.  He sits

     in Zen pose, cigarette in mouth, finishes typing Haiku.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 I faxed them around to everyone.

     He hits "SEND," gets the "ERROR CHIME" SOUND.  He presses

     this key over and over.  Boss enters.

                             BOSS

                 Is that your blood?

                             JACK

                 Some of it, yes.

     Boss stares at Jack like he's from Mars.

                             BOSS

                 Take the rest of the day off.  Come

                 back tomorrow with clean clothes.

                 Get yourself together.

     INT. HALLWAY - SAME

     Jack's leaving, looks like a war casualty, passing COWORKERS

     who coldly stare at him.  His face is totally passive.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 I got right in everyone's hostile

                 little face.  Yes, these are bruises

                 from fighting.  I'm comfortable with

                 them.  I am enlightened.

     EXT. PAPER STREET - SUNSET

     Jack walks toward the HOUSE.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 You give up the condo life, give up

                 all your flaming worldly possessions,

                 go live in a dilapidated house in the

                 toxic waste part of town...

     INT. TYLER'S KITCHEN - SUNSET

     Jack walks in.  SOUNDS of VIOLENT SEX and a POLAROID CAMERA

     from upstairs.  Pieces of PLASTER fall from the ceiling.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 ... and you come home to this.

                             TYLER'S VOICE

                       (laughing)

                 You fucking slut!!

                             MARLA'S VOICE

                 Thank you, sir, may I have another!

                 Thank you sir, may I have another... !

     Jack rolls his eyes, takes off his pants.  He runs water in

     the sink, finds a tiny bit of SOAP and scrubs at the blood

     stains.  The PHONE RINGS.  He answers it.

                             JACK

                 Yeah.  Speaking.

     INTERCUT WITH...

     INT. POLICE STATION - OFFICE

     A cop, DETECTIVE STERN, refers to a file.

                             DETECTIVE STERN

                 This is Detective Stern with the

                 arson unit.  We have some new

                 information about the "incident" at

                 your condo.

                             JACK

                 Yes?

                             DETECTIVE STERN

                 I don't know if you're aware... your

                 front door -- it seems someone

                 sprayed freon into the lock, then

                 tapped it with a chisel to shatter

                 the cylinder.

                             JACK

                 No, I wasn't aware...

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 I am Jack's Cold Sweat.

                             DETECTIVE STERN

                 Does this sound strange to you?

                             JACK

                 Yes, sire, strange.  Very strange.

     Jack starts to sweat, scrubs his pants obsessively.

                             DETECTIVE STERN

                 The dynamite...

                             JACK

                 Dynamite?

                             DETECTIVE STERN

                 Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium

                 oxalate and potassium perchloride.

                 Do you know what that means?

                             JACK

                 What does that mean?

                             DETECTIVE STERN

                 It means it was homemade.

                             JACK

                 This is... really a shock...

                             DETECTIVE STERN

                 Whoever set this homemade dynamite

                 could've blown out the pilot light

                 days before the explosion.  The gas,

                 it seems, was just a detonator.

                             JACK

                 Who do you think could've done this?

                             DETECTIVE STERN

                 I'll ask the questions, son.

                             TYLER

                       (whispering in Jack's ear)

                 Tell him...

     Jack almost leaps out his skin, startled; looks to see Tyler

     standing right next to him.

                             JACK

                 Huh?

                             TYLER

                       (overlap w/below)

                 "The liberator who destroyed my

                 property has re-aligned my paradigm

                 of perception."

                             JACK

                 Shhhhhh!

                       (into phone,

                        overlap w/above)

                 I don't know what to make of this,

                 sir, I really don't...

                             DETECTIVE STERN

                 Do you know anyone who'd have the

                 expertise or motive to do something

                 like this?

                             TYLER

                 "I reject the basic assumptions of

                 civilization, including material

                 possession."

     Jack pushes Tyler away, cups the receiving.

                             JACK

                       (into phone)

                 No.  No, sir.  I loved that condo.

                 I loved every stick of furniture.

                 The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were

                 me.  The dishes were me.  The plants

                 were...

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 I'd like to thank the academy...

                             DETECTIVE STERN

                 Well, if any ideas come to you, give

                 me a call.  In the meantime, don't

                 leave town.  I may need to bring you

                 in for questioning.

     END INTERCUT

     Jack hangs up.  Tyler shrugs.

                             TYLER

                 Could be worse.  You could be cursed

                 with the three terrible Karmas.  You

                 could be beautiful, rich and famous.

     Jack turns away, continues to scrub his pants.  Marla's

     FOOTSTEPS can be HEARD coming downstairs...

     Jack really grinds the soap against the pants, splashing

     water.  He turns, sees Marla enter.  Tyler is GONE.  Marla

     lights a cigarette.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Except for their humping, Tyler and

                 Marla were never in the same room.

                             MARLA

                 I got this dress at a thrift store

                 for one dollar.

                             JACK

                       (keeps scrubbing)

                 Worth every penny.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 My parents pulled this exact act for

                 years -- one came in, the other

                 disappeared.

     Marla begins a slow, exotic dance, moving very close to

     Jack.  She lifts her dress dangerously high, dancing close

     to Jack's body, almost touhcing.

                             MARLA

                       (seductive)

                 It's a bridesmaid's dress.  Someone

                 loved it intensely for one day, then

                 tossed it.  Like a Christmas tree --

                 so special, then, bam -- it's

                 abandoned on the side of the road,

                 tinsel still clinging to it...

     Jack becomes very aware of having no pants on, presses

     against the counter.  Marla pulls her hemline further up.

                             MARLA

                 Like sex crime victims, underwear

                 inside-out, bound with electrical

                 tape.

                             JACK

                       (coldly)

                 It suits you.

     She leans in very close to Jack's ear, whispers hoarsely:

                             MARLA

                 You can borrow it sometime.

     Jack takes a step away, keeps scrubbing.  Marla blows smoke

     in his face.  Jack takes her cigarette and throws it in the

     sink.  Marla backs away, fed up, storms out, going UPSTAIRS.

                             TYLER (O.S.)

                 Get rid of her.

     Jack turns to see Tyler in the doorway.

                             JACK

                 You get rid of her.

                             TYLER

                       (pointing at Jack)

                 Don't mention me.

     Marla's FOOTSTEPS are coming DOWNSTAIRS.  Jack looks to the

     archway, then back at -- Tyler's GONE.  Marla enters, shoes

     and balled up clothing under one arm, looking for something

     on the junk strewn table.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 I'm six years old again, passing

                 messages between my parents.

                             JACK

                 I, uh... think you should go now.

     Marla ignores, still searching the table, tossing things,

     pushing other things off to the floor.

                             JACK

                 It's time for you to leave.

                             MARLA

                 Don't worry, I'm leaving.

     Marla finds what she wanted, a pack of cigarettes.  She

     moves up into Jack's face.

                             MARLA

                 You're such a nutcase, I can't even

                 begin to keep up.

                             JACK

                 Goodbye.

     She laughs, spins on her heels.  As she exits the back door,

     she sings "This Merry-Go-Round" from "Valley of the Dolls."

     Jack watches her through the kitchen window.

                             TYLER (O.S.)

                 Nice work.

     Jack turns.  Tyler's right behind him.  Through the window,

     Marla can be seen walking away.  Tyler picks up the remnant

     of SOAP Jack's been using, holds it up to Jack.

                             TYLER

                 To make soap, first we have to render

                 fat.

     Jack looks at Tyler.

     CLOSE UP - SIGN: "DANGER - BIOHAZARD."

     EXT. FENCED-IN BIOHAZARD WASTE DUMP SITE - NIGHT

     Tyler stands inside the fence.  Jack's atop the fence,

     struggling to cross BARBED WIRE.  He wobbles, gets over,

     snags his shirt.  Jack falls, RIPPPPP.  Tyler helps.

     FOOTSTEPS.  A FLASHLIGHT BEAM.  Tyler pulls Jack behind a

     DUMPSTER, one of DOZENS.  A silhouette of a SECURITY GUARD

     moves along the perimeter, flashlight first.  He walks away.

     MOVE BACK to Tyler and Jack, who emerge from hiding.  Tyler

     eagerly grabs the lid of the closest dumpster.

                             TYLER

                 The best fat for making soap --

                 because the salt balance is just

                 right -- comes form human bodies...

     Tyler lifts the lid -- it CREAKS.

                             JACK

                 What is this place?

                             TYLER

                 A liposuction clinic.

     From the dumpster, Tyler pulls out an industrial-sized,

     thick plastic bag full of PINK GOO.

                             TYLER

                 Paydirt.  From society's richest

                 asses and thighs.

     TIME CUT: Tyler and Jack climb back over the fence, carrying

     BAGS of fat.  One of Jack's bags RIPS, spilling the goo down

     the chain-link fench.  Jack slips and slides.  Tyler laughs.

     Tyler tries to scoop the running fat back into the bag.

     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Jack and Tyler each stir a boiling pot.

                             TYLER

                 As the fat renders, the tallow floats

                 to the surface.  Remember the crap

                 they taught you in Boy Scouts.

                             JACK

                 Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts.

                             TYLER

                 This clear layer in glycerin.  We'll

                 mix it back in when we make the soap.

     Tyler sticks a spoon into a pot, lifts up a scoop of the

     glycerin layer.  Then, he crabs a can, opens it.

                             TYLER

                 Lye -- the crucial ingredient.

                       (adding lye to mix)

                 Ancient peoples found their clothes

                 got cleaner if they washed them at a

                 certain spot in the river.  Why?

                 Because, human sacrifices were once

                 made on the hills above this river.

                 Year after year, bodies burnt.  Rain

                 feel.  Water seeped through the wood

                 ashes to become lye.  The lye

                 combined with the melted fat of the

                 bodies, till a thick white soapy

                 discharge crept into the river.

     Tyler licks his lips until they're gleaming wet.  He takes

     Jack's hands and KISSES the back of it.

                             TYLER

                 The first soap was made from the

                 ashes of heroes.  Like the first

                 monkeys shot into space.

     The saliva shines in the shape of the kiss.  Tyler pours a

     bit of the flaked lye onto Jack's hand.

                             TYLER

                 Without sacrifice, without death, we

                 would have nothing.

     Jack's whole body JERKS.  Tyler holds tight to Jack's hand

     and arm.  Tears well in Jack's eyes; his face tightens.

                             TYLER

                 This is a chemical burn.  It will

                 hurt more than you've ever been

                 burned and you will have a scar.

     Jack looks -- the burn is swollen, glossy, in the shape of

     Tyler's kiss.  Jack's face spasms.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Tyler's kiss was a bonfire on the

                 back of my hand.

                             TYLER

                 Look at your hand.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Guided meditation worked for cancer,

                 it could work for this.

     SHOT OF A GREEN MAPLE LEAF, GLISTENING WITH DEW.  RESUME:

     Tyler looks at Jack's glazed and detached eyes.

                             TYLER

                 Come back to the pain.  Don't shut

                 this out.

     Jack, snapping back, tries to jerk his hand away.  Tyler

     keeps hold of it and their arms KNOCK UTENSILS off the table.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 I tried not to think of the words

                 "searing" or "flesh."  I imagined my

                 pain as a ball of healing white light.

     SHOT OF A FOREST, IN GENTLE SPRING RAINFALL.  RESUME:

     Tyler JERKS Jack's hand, getting Jack's attention...

                             TYLER

                 Stop it.  This is your pain -- your

                 burning hand.  It's right here.  Look

                 at it.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 I was going to my cave to find my

                 power animal.

     SHOT OF THE INSIDE OF JACK'S FROZEN ICE CAVE.  RESUME:

     Tyler JERKS Jack's hand again.  Jack re-focuses on Tyler...

                             TYLER

                 Don't deal with this the way those

                 dead people do.  Deal with it the way

                 a living person does.

     SHOT OF INSIDE THE ICE CAVE - ON MARLA, LYING NAKED UNDER A

     FUR COAT, TURNING HER HEAD TO LOOK TOWARDS US.  RESUME:

     Jack tries to pull his hand free.  Tyler won't let go.

     Jack's eyes glaze over again.  Jack speaks, whiny from pain:

                             JACK

                 I... I think I understand.  I think

                 I get it...

                             TYLER

                 No, what you're feeling is premature

                 enlightenment.

     SHOT OF A GREEN FOREST WITHOUT RAIN.  RESUME:

     Tyler SLAPS Jack's face, regaining his attention...

                             TYLER

                 This is the greatest moment of your

                 life and you're off somewhere,

                 missing it.

                             JACK

                 No, I'm not...

     SHOT OF TREES ENGULFED BY A FOREST FIRE.  RESUME:

                             TYLER

                 Shut up.  Our fathers were our models

                 for God.  And, if our fathers bailed,

                 what does that tell us about God?

                             JACK

                 I don't know...

     SHOT OF EMBERS POURING FROM THE HELLISH FOREST FIRE.  RESUME:

     Tyler SLAPS Jack's face again...

                             TYLER

                 Listen to me.  You have to consider

                 the possibility that God doesn't like

                 you, he never wanted you.  In all

                 probability, He hates you.  This is

                 not the worst thing that can happen...

                             JACK

                 It isn't... ?

                             TYLER

                 We don't need him...

                             JACK

                 We don't... ?

     SHOT OF INSIDE ICE CAVE - NAKED MARLA PULLS JACK DOWN ON TOP

     OF HER - JACK KISSES HER - CIGARETTE SMOKE COMES FROM HER

     MOUTH - JACK COUGHS.  RESUME:

     Jack is a wide-eyed zombie...

                             JACK

                 ... Marla ... ?

                             TYLER

                 Fuck damnation.  Fuck redemption.  We

                 are God's unwanted children, with no

                 special place and no special

                 attention, and so be it.

     Jack looks at Tyler -- they lock eyes.  Jack does his best

     to stifle his spasms of pain, his body a quivering, coiled

     knot.  He bolts toward the sink, but Tyler holds on.

                             TYLER

                 You can go to the sink and run water

                 over your hand.  Look at me.  Or you

                 can use vinegar to neutralize the

                 burn, but first you have to give up.

                 First, you have to know that someday,

                 you are going to die.  Until you know

                 that, you will be useless.

     Jack spasms with a shiver of pain...

                             JACK

                 You ... you don't know what this

                 feels like, Tyler.

     Tyler shows Jack a LYE-BURNED KISS SCAR on his own hand.

     Tears begin to drip from Jack's eyes.  Tyler grabs a bottle

     of VINEGAR -- pours it over Jack's wound.

     Jack closes his eyes, holds his hand... slumps to the floor.

                             TYLER

                 Congratulations.  You're a step

                 closer to hitting bottom.

     INT. BARNEY'S - DAY

     Jack and Tyler, in trench coats, looking like deaht-warmed-

     over, wait as a BUYER fills out forms.

     There are bars of "The Paper Street Soap Company" soap on

     the counter.  Jack looks like he's half-expecting to get

     arrested.  His hand is BANDAGED.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Tyler sold the soap to department

                 stores at twenty bucks a Ear.  God

                 knows what they charged.  How ironic.

                 We were selling rich women their own

                 fat asses back to them.

     INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY

     Jack sits at his desk, playing a game on his computer,

     smoking a cigarette.  Boss enters.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 He was wearing a yellow tie.  It must

                 be Thursday.  I didn't even wear a tie

                 to work anymore.

     Boss slaps a piece of PAPER down on Jack's desk.

                             BOSS

                 "The first rule of fight club is you

                 don't talk about fight club."

     Jack snuffs his cigarette in an ashtray, stares up stoically.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 I must've left the original in the

                 copy machine.

                             BOSS

                 "The second rule of fight club...

                 Is this yours?

                             JACK

                 Hmm?

                             BOSS

                 You don't get paid to abuse the copy

                 machine.

                             JACK

                 "Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an

                 image.

                             BOSS

                 Pretend you're me.  You find this.

                 What would you do?

     Jack rises slowly, walks to his door, shuts it.

                             JACK

                 Me? I'd be very careful who I talked

                 to about this.  It sounds like

                 someone dangerous wrote it... someone

                 who might snap at any moment,

                 stalking from office to office with

                 an Armalite AR-10 Carbine-gas

                 semiautomatic, bitterly pumping round

                 after round into colleagues and co-

                 workers.

     Jack moves very close to Boss, picks up the PAPER and starts

     tearing it into pieces.

                             JACK

                 Might be someone you've known for

                 years... somebody very close to you.

                 Or, maybe you shouldn't be bringing

                 me every little piece of trash you

                 pick up.

     Jack puts the PAPER in his trash.  Bass stares with a tinge

     of outrage, a tinge of fear.  PHONE RINGS.  Jack answers it.

                             JACK

                 Compliance and Liability.

                             MARLA'S VOICE

                 My tit's going to rot off.

                             JACK

                 Just a second.

                       (to Boss; smiles)

                 Could you excuse me?  I need to take

                 this call.

     Boss goes to the door, stares at Jack a beat, then leaves.

                             JACK

                       (into phone)

                 What are you talking about?

     INTERCUT WITH - CLOSE UP OF MARLA...

                             MARLA

                 Would you do something for me?  I

                 need you to check and see if there's

                 a lump in my breast.  I can't afford

                 to throw money away on a doctor.

                             JACK

                 I don't know ...

                             MARLA

                 Please.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 She didn't call Tyler.  I'm neutral

                 in her book.

     EXT. MARLA'S HOTEL - SUNSET

     Jack walks down the sidewalk, seeing Marla take two BOXES

     from a VAN with the sign "MEALS ON WHEELS."

     INT. MARLA'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

     Marla leads Jack inside.

                             JACK

                 This is a sweet side of you.  Picking

                 these up for ...

                       (reads the boxes:)

                 "Mrs. Haniver" and... "Mrs. Raines."

                 Where are they?

                             MARLA

                 Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive

                 and I'm in poverty.  You want any?

                             JACK

                 No, thanks.

                             MARLA

                 Good.

     He stares at her while she eats.

                             MARLA

                 What happened to your hand?

     Jack awkwardly puts his bandaged hand behind his back.

                             JACK

                 Nothing.

     INT. MARLA'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Marla stands facing a MIRROR with her shirt open.  Jack

     stands behind her with his hand on the bottom side of her

     breast.  Marla's hand guides his.

                             JACK

                 Where?  Here?

                             MARLA

                 Here.

                             JACK

                 There?

                             MARLA

                 Here.

                             JACK

                 Here.

                             MARLA

                 Feel anything?

                             JACK

                 No.

     Jack's head is behind Marla's.  They speak softer, slower.

                             MARLA

                 Make sure.

                             JACK

                 Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.

                             MARLA

                 You feel nothing?

                             JACK

                 Nothing.

     Marla turns around and faces him, begins to button her shirt.

                             MARLA

                 Well, that's a relief.  Thank you.

                             JACK

                 No... no problem.

                             MARLA

                 I wish I could return the favor.

     Jack touches his own chest, shakes his head.

                             JACK

                 I think everything's okay here.

                             MARLA

                 I could check your prostate.

                             JACK

                 Uh ... nah.

                             MARLA

                       (pause)

                 Well... thanks, anyway.

     Marla leans to kiss him -- lingers for a bit longer than

     just friendly.  Jack pulls away.

                             JACK

                 So.... are we done?

     Marla sighs.

                             MARLA

                 Yeah, we're done.  See you around.

     EXT. HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

     Jack emerges from the lobby.  He looks up at Marla's window,

     watches her silhouette.  He walks away, right into -- Big

     BOB, the moose, eating a donut and drinking orange juice.

                             BOB

                 Cornelius!  How are you?

                             JACK

                 Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?

                             BOB

                 Better than I've ever been in my life.

                             JACK

                 Really?  Great.  Still "Remaining Men

                 Together?"

     An intense look of born-again fervor comes over Bob's face.

                             BOB

                 No.  I found something new.

                             JACK

                 Really, what's that?

                             BOB

                       (quietly)

                 The first rule is... you aren't

                 supposed to talk about it...

                             JACK

                 Oh.

                             BOB

                 And the second rule about it is...

                 you're not supposed to talk about it.

                 And the third rule...

                             JACK

                 Bob, Bob... I'm a member.

                                  BOB

                 You are?!

                             JACK

                 Look at my face.

     Bob roughly slaps Jack's shoulder.

                             BOB

                 That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking

                 great! Congratulations.

                             JACK

                 Yeah, both of us.

                             BOB

                 You know about the guy who invented

                 it? I hear all kinds of things.

                 Supposedly, he was born in a mental

                 institution.  They say he only sleeps

                 one hour a night.  You know about

                 this guy?  Tyler Durden?

     INT. BASEMENT - ELECTRONICS WKREHOUSE - NIGHT

     The CROWD SCREAMS insanely as Bob and Jack go at it in the

     circle of light.  Bob's eyes are wild with glee.

     EXT. BASEMENT DOOR - ELECTRONICS WAREHOUSE - LATER

     Everyone sneaks out of this new location - we've seen none

     of these guys before - it's a new chapter.  Jack and Bob

     Stagger out last, Jack being in worse shape.  They both grin

     with religious serenity.  Bob hugs Jack.

                             BOB

                 Thank you.  Thank you.

     Bob relaxes the hug and Jack drops to the ground like a

     sack, completely enervated from the beating he took.

                             JACK

                 You're welcome.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Fight club -- this was mine and

                 Tyler's gift... our gift to the world.

     INT. KITCHEN -- MORNING

     Jack has his briefcase on the table, looks at PAPERWORK.

     Tyler wanders in, carries a dirty pot to the sink.  Jack

     takes out a cigarette, lights up.  He offers the pack...

                             TYLER

                 No thanks, I quit.

                             JACK

                 You quit?

                             TYLER

                 Yeah.  Where you headed?

                             JACK

                 Work.  Going to work.

     Tyler scratches his chin absently.

                             JACK

                 What... ?

                             TYLER

                 Nothing.  Do what you like.

     Tyler walks out the way he came.

     INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY

     Jack sits staring at his SCREEN SAVER.

     INT. BOSS'S OFFICE - DAY

     Jack steps into the open doorway, knocks on the doorframe.

     Boss looks up from his large, expensive desk.

                             JACK

                 We need to talk.

                             BOSS

                 Okay.  Where to begin?  With your

                 constant absenteeism?  With your

                 unpresentable appearance?  You're up

                 for review...

                             JACK

                 I Am Jack's Complete Lack of Surprise.

     Boss sits up in his seat, becoming enraged.

                             JACK

                 Let's pretend.  You're the Department

                 of Transportation, and you discover

                 that our company intentionally did

                 nothing about leather seats cured in

                 third world countries with chemicals

                 we know cause birth defects?  Brake

                 linings that fail after a thousand

                 miles.  Fuel injectors that burn

                 people alive.

                             BOSS

                 Just who the fuck do you think you

                 are?!  Get out!  You're fired!

                             JACK

                 What about this?  Keep me on payroll

                 as an outside consultant.  In

                 exchange for my salary, I'll keep my

                 mouth shut.  I won't need to come to

                 the office.  I can do this job from

                 home.

     Boss stands, moves around his desk, glaring with rage.

                             BOSS

                 You little fucker!  I oughta...

     Jack PUNCHES HIMSELF in the nose.  Blood starts to trickle.

     He punches himself in the jaw, throws himself back as if by

     the force of the punch, SLAMS against a framed picture and

     SHATTERS the glass.  He falls to the floor.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 I Am Jack's Smirking Revenge.

     Jack gets back to his feet.

                             JACK

                 Please... don't hit me again, please.

                 I'm your responsibility...

     He PUNCHES himself in the stomach, then in the jaw again.

     He reels backwards, pulls down a hanging shelf, its contents

     flying.  He hits the floor.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 For some reason, I thought of my

                 first fight -- with Tyler.

     Jack crawls toward Boss, dripping blood, grabs Boss's leg.

                             JACK

                 Please... give me the paychecks like

                 I asked for.  I won't be any trouble.

                 You won't see me again.

     Jack climbs up Boss's leg while Boss tries to shake him off.

     Boss stumbles back into his desk, knocking off belongings.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Under and behind and inside

                 everything this man took for granted,

                 something horrible had been growing.

     Jack crawls high enough to grab Boss's belt, hoisting

     himself up.  He dribbles blood an Boss's clothing, SMUDGES

     blood from his face onto the knuckles of Boss's hand.

                             JACK

                 Please... please...

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 And right then, at our most excellent

                 moment together...

     Two SECURITY GUARDS enter and gape at the sight.  Behind

     them stand CURIOUS WORKERS, looking in.

                             JACK

                       (gurgling blood)

                 Please don't hit me again.

     INT. TYLER'S HOUSE - ENTRANCE FOYER - DAY

     Jack holds a CHECK in front of Tyler's face.

                             JACK

                 Six months advance pay.  Six months!

                             TYLER

                 Fucking sweet.

                             JACK

                 Okay, and... and...

     Jack digs in his pocket, takes out a thick bundle of CARDS.

                             JACK

                 Forty-eight airline flight coupons.

                 Plus... hold on... just a minute...

     Jack holds up a finger, going to open the front door.  He

     drags an unwieldy SHOPPING CART in behind him; filled with

     his COMPUTER, PHONE, FAX and other office equipment.

                             JACK

                 I am now officially self-employed.

     Jack looks at the cart, then back at Tyler, proud.

                             TYLER

                 Good for you.

     INT. LOU'S TAVERN - BASEMENT - NIGHT

     LOUD.  An enormous CROWD of guys, including Jack and Bob,

     stands around Tyler, who's in the center of the circle,

     holding up his hands to quiet them...

                             TYLER

                 I look around... I look around and

                 see a lot of new faces.

     An enthusiastic RUMBLE from the crowd.

                             TYLER

                 Shut up!  Which means a lot of you

                 have been breaking the first two

                 rules of fight club.

     A glum silence falls.  Guys look at each other.

                             TYLER

                 I see in fight club the strongest and

                 smartest men who have ever lived --

                 an entire generation pumping gas and

                 waiting tables; or they're slaves

                 with white collars.

                             (more)

                             TYLER (cont)

                 Advertisements have them chasing cars

                 and clothes, working jobs they hate

                 so they can buy shit they don't need.

                 We are the middle children of

                 history, with no purpose or place.

                 We have no great war, or great

                 depression.  The great war is a

                 spiritual war.  The great depression

                 is our lives.  We were raised by

                 television to believe that we'd be

                 millionaires and movie gods and rock

                 stars -- but we won't.  And we're

                 learning that fact.  And we're very,

                 very pissed-off.

     The crowd erupts into a DEAFENING CHORUS of agreement.  Jack

     looks at the blazing excitement in the eyes of the crowd.

                             TYLER

                 We are the quiet young men who listen

                 until it's time to decide.

     A fat, MIDDLE-AGED MAN stomps down the stairs, pushing into

     the crowd, followed by a TALL, HEFTY THUG who holds a GUM.

                             TYLER

                 Who are you?

                             FAT MAN (LOU)

                 Who am I?!  There's a sign on the

                 front that says "Lou's Tavern." I'm

                 fucking Lou.  Who the fuck are you?!

                             TYLER

                 Tyler Durden.

     Tyler extends his hand for a shake, but Lou SLAPS it away.

                             LOU

                 Who told you motherfuckers you could

                 use my place?

                             TYLER

                 We have a deal worked out with Irvine.

                             LOU

                 Irvine?  Irvine's at home with a

                 broken collarbone.

     Everyone glances guiltily at each other.

                             LOU

                 He don't own this place, I do.  How

                 much money's he getting for this?

                             TYLER

                 There is no money.

                             LOU

                 Really?

                             TYLER

                 It's free to all.

                             LOU

                 Ain't that something?

                             TYLER

                 Yes, it is.

                             LOU

                 Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone

                 outta here now!

                             TYLER

                 You're welcome to join our club.

                             LOU

                 Did you hear what I just said?!

                             TYLER

                 You and your friend.

     Lou SLUGS Tyler in the stomach, doubles him over.

                             LOU

                 You hear me now?

     Tyler gains his breath, determined.  He looks up, turns his

     head, looking to Jack.  Jack watches, wide-eyed.

     Tyler straightens, facing Lou.

                             TYLER

                 No, I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

     Lou PUNCHES Tyler in the face.  Some of the guys move

     forward, but the Thug points his gun.  Jack-runs forward

     anyway -- Lou PUNCHES him in the face.

     More guys move forward, but Tyler waves them off, facing Lou.

                             TYLER

                 We really need to use this place.

     Lou proceeds to beat the shit out of Tyler, PUNCHING his

     face, his stomach.  Tyler collapses to the floor.  Lou

     starts KICKING his.  Tyler bleeds from the mouth and face.

                             TYLER

                 That's it.... that's good.  Get it

                 all out.  You'll feel better.

     Lou flushes red with exasperation, KICKS more.  Finally,

     sweating, bewildered, Lou stops.  He looks to the Thug, who

     is just as bewildered.

     Suddenly, Tyler SPRINGS UP, grabs onto Lou...

                             TYLER

                 Yes, I am shit and crazy, to you and

                 this whole fucking world...

     Tyler's blood spatters on Lou.  Lou tries to shake Tyler

     off, but Tyler BITES Lou's NECKTIE.  The Thug grabs Tyler

     and pulls, the necktie tightening and strangling Lou.  Lou

     slaps at Tyler's face, but recoils from the blood.  Tyler

     spits and shouts through clenched teeth...

                             TYLER

                 You don't know where I've been.

     Tyler bear hugs Lou, pulls him to the floor.  Tyler rubs his

     bloody face into Lou's face.  The Thug lifts Tyler.  Tyler

     clings to Lou's belt, dragging Lou as he is dragged...

                             TYLER

                 We need this place.  We need it.

                 Please let us keep it, please...

     Blood dribbles out of Tyler's mouth, spattering Lou.

                             LOU

                 What are you doing?!

                             TYLER

                 Pleeeeeease!

                             LOU

                 Okay!  Okay, fuck it!  Use the

                 basement!  Get off me!

                             TYLER

                 We need some towels, Lou.  We need

                 replacement light bulbs.

                             LOU

                 Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go!

                             TYLER

                 Thank you.  Thank you, sir...

                             LOU

                 Let go of me!!

     Tyler lets go of Lou's belt.  Lou scrambles away.  The Thug

     drops Tyler, trying to keep clear of the blood.  Lou gets to

     his feet, looks at Tyler, then at the rest of the guys.  He

     and the Thug back away... slamming the door behind.

     Fight club surrounds Tyler.  They help him up, move him to

     a crate.  Tyler sits slumped for a long moment, his

     breathing labored... then, he sits back, crossing his legs

     and looking to the group, his demeanor businesslike.

                             TYLER

                 This week, each of you has a homework

                 assignment.  You're going to go out

                 and start a fight with a total

                 stranger...

                       (pause, drooling blood)

                 You're going to start a fight... and

                 you're going to lose.

     Jack beams in appreciation.

     EXT. STREET - DAY

     Ricky trips a passing YUPPIE.  The Yuppie falls.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Not as easy as it sounds.  People'll

                 do just about anything to avoid a

                 fight.

     The Yuppies gets up, angry, and Ricky PUNCHES him...

                             YUPPIE

                 Hey!  Wha... What the hell... what

                 are you doing?!  Who are you?!!

     The Yuppie backs away.  Ricky follows...

                             YUPPIE

                 Get away from me!  Keep away!

                 NO... !

     Ricky TACKLES the Yuppie.  The Yuppie struggles spastically.

                             YUPPIE

                 Who are you!?  Why are you attacking

                 me... ?!

     Having no recourse, the Yuppie begins trading blows.

     EXT. AUTO SHOP - DAY

     A MECHANIC WITH A BATTERED FACE uses a hose to wash the

     sidewalk.  As MEN pass, he jerks the hose up and SPRAYS them.

                             FIRST MAN

                 Hey... hey...

                             SECOND MAN

                 Watch out, jackass!

     These men continue on their way.

     The Mechanic sprays a third man, a SEMINARY STUDENT, who

     looks down, stunned.

                             SEMINARIAN

                 You... you did that on purpose!

     The Mechanic DOUSES the Seminarian.  The Seminarian grabs

     the hose, wrestling the Mechanic for it.  The Mechanic

     shoves the Seminarian, who responds with a half-assed PUNCH.

     The Mechanic purposely takes it.  The Seminarian starts to

     run away.  The Mechanic sprints after him, PUNCHING the

     Seminarian in the back of the neck.  They fight.

     INT. RECORD STORE STOCKROOM - NIGHT

     A FIST smashes a JAW.  Guys CHEER.  An arm snakes around a

     neck and squeezes, blood and sweat dripping.  It's the

     YUPPIE and the SEMINARIAN fighting.  Tyler walks around the

     perimeter of the circle.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Now nobody was the center of fight

                 club except the two men fighting.

                 The leader walked around in the

                 crowd, out in the darkness.

     Tyler hands ENVELOPES out to the crowd.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Everyone took a homework assignment.

     EXT. STREET - LATE NIGHT

     Ricky and another FIGHT CLUBBER paste up a BILLBOARD which

     reads: "DID YOU KNOW? YOU CAN USE YOUR OLD MOTOR OIL TO

     FERTILIZE YOUR LAWN! -- ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY."

     INT. PAPER STREET HOUSE

     HANDS use a MARKER, writing on a FILE: "Disinformation."

     EXT. LARGE PARKING LOT - DAY

     Jack and Tyler, in work gloves, armed with TOOLS, work

     together to lift the entire METAL PLATE of EXIT SPIKES from

     the ground.  They reverse it, then replace it.

     MOMENTS LATER

     Jack and Tyler walk away, each carrying a 4x4 plank of WOOD.

                             JACK

                 There's fight club in Delaware City.

                             TYLER

                 I heard.  Local 15, Monday nights.

     As they pass PARKED CARS, they SWING the planks against

     front bumpers -- activating ALARMS and INFLATING AIR BAGS...

                             JACK

                 Local 8 just started in Penns Grove.

                 And, Bob said he was at fight club in

                 Newcastle last week.

                             TYLER

                 Newcastle?  Did you start that one?

                             JACK

                 I thought you did.

     In the background, a CAR quickly EXITS the parking lot --

     front tires EXPLODING, wheel rims throwing sparks.

     INT. FAMILY HOUSEHOLD -- NIGHT

     FATHER, MOTHER, YOUNG DAUGHTER and SON, eat dinner, watching

     TELEVISION.  Suddenly, the TV IMAGE turns to SNOW and static.

     Family members stop eating.  Father picks up the REMOTE,

     points it -- all channels are SNOW.

     Father turns the TV OFF.  He and his family members look at

     each other, utensils in hand, uncomfortable.

     EXT. CITY ROOFTOPS - NIGHT

     The Yuppie SWINGS a BASEBALL BAT -- DESTROYS a digital

     SATELLITE DISH.  The Yuppie and the Seminarian move on,

     climbing to a neighboring rooftop.  They come upon another

     DISH.  The Seminarian takes the bat, takes a SWING...

     INT. PAPER STREET HOUSE

     HANDS place NEWS CLIPPINGS into a FILE: "Mischief."

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - ON GROUND - DAY

     Two AIRPLANE MAINTENANCE,MEN, with bruised faces, rip open

     a box from a PRINT SHOP.  They dig up AIRPLANE SAFETY

     INSTRUCTION CARDS and begin inserting them into each

     seatback.  We SEE a CARD - it shows passengers SCREAMING

     and FLAILING ABOUT IN TERROR.

     INT. BUSINESS OFFICE - NIGHT

     Huge office.  Rows and rows of desks.  FIGHT CLUB MEMBERS

     work: one guy moving from COMPUTER MONITOR to COMPUTER

     MONITOR, using a DRILL to drill a hole into the top of each.

     Other guys follow behind, with FUNNELS and CANS of GASOLINE,

     filling each monitor with gasoline.

     INT. PAPER STREET HOUSE

     Files and newspaper clippings are piled up.  HANDS write on

     a new FILE FOLDER: "Arson."

     EXT. ROOFTOP -- DAY

     The Yuppie crumbles a loaf of stale bread into a bucket,

     stirring it with a big spoon, mixing in a BOTTLE of EX-LAX.

     Nearby, Rob throws handfuls of wet BREADCRUMBS to PIGEONS...

     HUNDREDS of PIGEONS -- a rooftop feeding-frenzy.

     EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT

     Tyler and Jack cross the parking lot, towards the

     convenience store.  Jack wears a BACKPACK.

                             TYLER

                 Let me have that a minute...

     Tyler takes the BACKPACK, unzips it, searching the contents.

                             JACK

                 What are we doing?

                             TYLER

                 Homework assignment.

                             JACK

                 What is it?

     Tyler takes out a HANDGUN, hands the backpack back.

                             TYLER

                 Human Sacrifice.

     Jack turns white, staring at the gun.

     EXT. BEHIND THE CONVENIENCE STORE - MOMENTS LATER

     The BACK DOOR opens and Tyler brings the store's CLERK out

     at gunpoint, forces him to his knees.  Jack follows,

     freaked.  Tyler points the gun at the Clerk.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 On a long enough time line, the

                 survival rate for everyone drops to

                 zero.

                             CLERK

                 Please... don't...

                             TYLER

                 Give me your wallet.

     The Clerk fumbles his wallet out of his pocket and Tyler

     snatches it.  Tyler pulls out the DRIVER'S LICENCE.

                             TYLER

                 Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning,

                 apartment A.  A small, cramped

                 basement apartment.

                             RAYMOND

                 How'd you know?

                             TYLER

                 They give basement apartments letters

                 instead of numbers.  Raymond, you're

                 going to die.

     Tyler rummages through the wallet.

                             TYLER

                 Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?

                             RAYMOND

                 Yesssss...

                             TYLER

                 Your mom and dad will have to call

                 kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up

                 your dental records, because there

                 won't be much left of your face.

                             RAYMOND

                 Please, God, no...

     Raymond begins to weep, shoulders heaving.

                             JACK

                 Tyler...

                             TYLER

                 An expired community college student

                 ID card.  What did you used to study,

                 Raymond K. Hessel?

                             RAYMOND

                 S-S-Stuff.

                             TYLER

                 "Stuff."  Were the mid-terms hard?

     Tyler rams the gun barrel against Raymond's temple.

                             TYLER

                 I asked you what you studied.

                             JACK

                 Tell him!

                             RAYMOND

                 Biology, mostly.

                             TYLER

                 Why?

                             RAYMOND

                 I... I don't know...

                             TYLER

                 What did you want to be, Raymond K.

                 Hessel?

     Raymond weeps and says nothing.  Tyler COCKS the gun.

     Raymond GASPS.

                             TYLER

                 The question, Raymond, was "what did

                 you want to be?"

     A beat.

                             JACK

                 Answer him!

                             RAYMOND

                 A veterinarian!

                             TYLER

                 Animals.

                             RAYMOND

                 Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---

                             TYLER

                 Stuff.  That means you have to get

                 more schooling.

                             RAYMOND

                 Too much school.

     Tyler shoves Raymond's wallet back into Raymond's pocket.

                             TYLER

                 Would you rather be dead?

                             RAYMOND

                 No, please, no, God, no!

     Tyler moves the gun right between Raymond's eyes.

                             RAYMOND

                 NOOOOO!

     Tyler UNCOCKS the gun, lowers it.

                             TYLER

                 I'm keeping your license.  I know

                 where you live.  I'm going to check

                 on you.  If you aren't back in school

                 and on your way to being a

                 veterinarian in six weeks, you will

                 be dead.  Get the hell out of here.

     Raymond staggers to his feet, heads down an alleyway.  Jack

     and Tyler watch Raymond flee, then Tyler looks at Jack.

                             JACK

                   I feel sick.

                             TYLER

                   Imagine how he feels.

     Tyler brings the gun to his own head, pulls the trigger --

     CLICK.  Empty.

                             JACK

                 I don't care, that was horrible.

     Tyler walks away.

                             TYLER

                 Tomorrow will be the most beautiful

                 day of Raymond K. Hessell's life.

     Jack watches Tyler go.

                             TYLER

                 His breakfast will taste better than

                 any meal he has ever eaten.

     Jack turns to look the direction Raymond ran.  He finally

     turns back, following after Tyler.

     INT. BUSINESS OFFICE - NIGHT

     SLOW MOTION: in the deserted office, gasoline filled

     COMPUTER MONITORS begin to EXPLODE...BOOM...BOOM...BOOM... !

     EXT. CITY STREETS -- MORNING

     Luxury AUTOMOBILES are parked, splattered with BIRD SHIT.

     EXT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAWN

     VIEWED OUT 3RD STORY WINDOW: Tyler uses a RAKE, dragging it

     across rocks and dirt.  He stops a moment, rake on his

     shoulder, staring off.  Then, back to work...

                             TYLER

                       (muttering quietly)

                 ... You are not how much money you

                 have in the bank.  You are not the

                 shoes you wear.

     Tyler's marking a large SQUARE in the weeds and rubble of

     the backyard, kicking rocks away, dragging the rake...

                             TYLER

                 You are not the contents of your

                 wallet...

     INT. CITY BUS - NIGHT

     The DRIVER has a broken nose.  The bus is empty, except for

     Jack, in the very last seat, sleepy.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 He had a plan.  Maybe you just didn't

                 see it till it hit you between the

                 eyes.

                       (pause)

                 But, it started to make sense... in

                 a Tyler sort of way.  No fear.  No

                 distractions.  The ability to let

                 that which does not matter truly

                 slide.

     EXT. PAPER STREET - NIGHT

     Jack gets off the bus.  As the bus pulls away, we see it

     dropped Jack off right in front of the house.

     INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

     Jack enters.  Tyler, dressed in FATIGUES and splattered with

     PAINT, grabs BEERS from the refrigerator.

                             JACK

                 Hey.

                             TYLER

                 Hey.

     Jack notices ROPE and RAPPELLING TOOLS on the table.  Tyler

     comes to hand Jack a bunch of beers, nod to the living room.

                             TYLER

                 Go on in.  We're celebrating.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Jack, bewildered, enters carrying beers.  Tyler does NOT

     follow.  BOB, RICKY and several other fight club guys sit in

     front at the TV, chanting not too loudly, all also dressed

     in FATIGUES and splattered with PAINT.

                             RICKY

                 You are not your job.

                             OTHERS TOGETHER

                 You are not your job.

                             RICKY

                 You are not how much money you have

                 in the bank.

                             BOB

                 Shhhh, wait... they're back to it...

     Bob goes to turn up the TV.  One guy, sixteen years old with

     an angelic face, ANGEL FACE, gets up to take beer from Jack.

                             ANGEL FACE

                       (to Jack)

                 Great, thanks.

     Angel face starts distributing beer amongst his cohorts.

                             BOB

                 Shhhhh!  Watch!

     Jack looks to the TV -- it shows a LIVE shot of the "PARKER

     MORRIS BUILDING."  The building has a GIANT, GRINNING FACE

     PAINTED on it -- two BROKEN WINDOWS for EYES, with flames

     pouring out... FIRETRUCKS spray water.

                             REPORTER (V.O.)

                 Police Commissioner Jacobs has just

                 arrived... just a second... excuse

                 me, Commissioner, could you tell us

                 what you think has happened?

     COMMISSIONER JACOBS, a wrinkled official, turns to camera.

                             COMMISSIONER JACOBS (V.O.)

                 We believe this is related to the

                 recent acts of vandalism around the

                 city.  It's some kind of organized

                 group, and we are coordinating a

                 rigorous investigation.

     Jack turns, sees Tyler in the archway, watching him.  Tyler

     tips his beer to toast, pulls back, out of sight.

                             JACK

                 What did you guys do?

     They all BURST INTO LAUGHTER.  They look at Jack and shake

     their heads.  Jack doesn't get it.  Suddenly, the guys'

     faces turn to stone.  Bob sits rigid.

                             BOB

                 The first rule of Project Mayhem

                 is... you do not ask questions.

     Jack stares at them.

                                                      CUT TO:

     INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT

     A luxurious BANQUET.  Commissioner Jacobs guzzles champagne.

     He rises and starts out of the room.  Jack, in a WAITER'S

     UNIFORM, looks apprehensively to OTHER WAITERS: BOB...

     RICKY... ANGEL FACE -- who all give each other a look.

     INT. HALLWAY

     Jacobs saunters down an empty hall.  He stops to check his

     tie in a mirror.  He pushes open the door of the MEN'S

     BATHROOM -- face to face with TYLER.

     INT. BATHROOM

     Tyler GRABS Commissioner Jacobs, pulling him into the

     bathroom.  He slaps a piece of tape over Jacobs' mouth.  The

     OTHER "WAITERS" rush in.  Jack stays back to keep the door

     shut.  Tyler and the others hold Jacobs, pulling down his

     pants.  Bob snaps a rubber band -- reaches to Jacob s crotch.

                             TYLER

                 Wrap it around the top of his hackie-

                 sack.

                             BOB

                 Man, his balls are ice cold.

     Ricky produces a KNIFE, moves it down to Jacob's testicles.

     Jacobs is bug-eyed.  Jack, red-faced, keeps his distance.

                             TYLER

                 You're not going to continue your

                 "rigorous investigation."  You will

                 publicly state that there is no

                 underground group.  Or -- imagine,

                 the rest of your life with your

                 scrotum flapping empty.

                             JACOBS

                       (mouth taped)

                 ... no... please, no...

                             TYLER

                 We'll send one to the New York Times

                 and one to the Los Angeles Times.

                 Press release style.  Your nuts will

                 be bicoastal.  Understood?  The

                 people you're after are everyone you

                 depend on.

                             (more)

                             TYLER (cont)

                 We do your laundry, cook your food

                 and serve you dinner.  We guard you

                 while you sleep.  We drive your

                 ambulances.  Do not fuck with us.

     Ricky makes a dramatic cut with the knife, causing Jacobs to

     JUMP -- Ricky holds up the severed RUBBER BAND.

     EXT. HOTEL - LATER

     Jack, Tyler and the others file quickly out the back SERVICE

     ENTRANCE.  Tyler gives Angel Face a hearty slap on the back.

     Angel Face smiles at Tyler, nods, grinning.

     Jack sees this, his eyes narrowing, stops walking.

     INT. TAVERN BASEMENT - NIGHT

     Fight club in full swing.  Jack battles Angel Face, BEATING

     the shit out of him with unprecedented viciousness.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 I felt like putting a bullet between

                 the eyes of every Panda that wouldn't

                 screw to save its species.

     The crowd shouts maniacally, save Tyler, who watches with an

     inscrutable stone face.

     Angel Face tries to speak, but Jack POUNDS too hard.  Blood

     flies.  The crowd begins to grow QUIETER.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 I wanted to open the dump valves on

                 oil tankers and smother all the

                 French beaches I'd never see.

     Finally, Angel Face lies still, unconscious.  Jack stops,

     stares down, numb.  Jack walks away -- the crowd parts to

     let him pass.  Jack scans faces... finds Tyler.

                             TYLER

                 Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?

                             JACK

                 I felt like destroying something

                 beautiful.

     EXT. STREET NEAR LOU'S TAVERN - LATER

     RAINING.  Tyler and Jack walk through pools of streetlight.

     A idling car HONKS.  Tyler leads Jack toward it.  A bruised-

     faced VALET PARKER thrown keys to Tyler, but Jack intercepts.

                             VALET

                 There you are, Mr. Durden.  Airport

                 parking, long term.

                             JACK

                       (motions to car)

                 After you, Mr. Durden...

                             TYLER

                 No... after you.

     INT. STOLEN CAR

     Tyler gets in the driver's seat.  Jack gets into the front

     passenger seat.  Ricky and the mechanic are in back.

     EXT. STREET

     Tyler pulls the stolen car away from the curb.  It has two

     bumperstickers: "RECYCLE YOUR ANIMALS" and "MAKE MINE VEAL."

     INT. STOLEN CAR - MOVING - LATER

     RAIN GUSHES down.  Jack stews, silent.  The car moves down

     a HIGHWAY, intermittently illuminated by oncoming headlights.

                             TYLER

                 Something on your mind?

                             JACK

                 No.

     Tyler shrugs; turns on the RADIO, ignores Jack.

                             JACK

                 Why wasn't I told about "Project

                 Mayhem?"

                             TYLER

                 What should I have told you?

                             JACK

                 Why wasn't I involved from the

                 beginning?  You and I started fight

                 club together.

                             TYLER

                 Fight club was the beginning.  Now

                 it's out of the basements and there's a

                 name for it -- Project Mayhem.

                             RICKY AND MECHANIC

                       (together)

                 The first rule of Project Mayhem is

                 you do not ask questions.

                             JACK

                 This is as much mine as yours.

                             TYLER

                 Is this a needlepoint club?  Is it

                 about you and me?

                             JACK

                 You know what I mean.

                             TYLER

                 What do you want?  A statement of

                 purpose... ?

                             JACK

                 Look...

                             TYLER

                 Should I E-mail you?  Should I put

                 this on your "action item list?"

                             JACK

                 I want to know --

                             TYLER

                 What do you want to know about

                 Project Mayhem?

                             RICKY AND MECHANIC

                       (together)

                 The first rule of Project Mayhem --

                             JACK

                       (to Ricky and Mechanic)

                 Shut up!!

                       (to Tyler)

                 I want to know what's going on.

     Tyler steers the car into the opposite lane, accelerates...

     Opposing HEADLIGHTS get closer fast...

                             TYLER

                 This does not belong to us.  We are

                 not the leaders.  We are not special.

                             JACK

                 What are you doing?!

                             TYLER

                 We are the all-singing, all-dancing

                 crap of the world.  We are all part

                 of the same compost heap...

                             JACK

                 Tyler...

     Tyler steers back into the proper lane.  The other CAR flies

     past, HORN SOUNDING...

                             JACK

                 What the hell ... ?!

                             TYLER

                 You choose your level of involvement.

                 I won't make decisions for you.

                             JACK

                 I'm not asking you to.

                             TYLER

                 You're asking questions that don't

                 have answers.  You know just as much

                 about Project Mayhem as anybody else.

                             JACK

                 I don't think that's true.

     Tyler again steers into the oncoming lane, speeding up.

     Through the windshield: oncoming headlights -- a TRUCK.

                             JACK

                 Tyler... what is this... !

     Jack fights	to turn the wheel, but Tyler uses both hands.

                             TYLER

                 What will you wish you'd done before

                 you died?

                             RICKY

                 Paint a self-portrait.

                             MECHANIC

                 Build a house.

                             TYLER

                       (to Jack)

                 And you?

                             JACK

                 I don't know!  Nothing!

                             TYLER

                 If you died right now, how would you

                 feel about your life?

                             JACK

                 I would feel nothing about my life?

                 Is that what you want to hear?!

     The oncoming truck HONKS and FLASHES its LIGHTS.  It moves

     to the other side of the road.  Tyler steers there, too.

                             TYLER

                 I want to hear the truth.

                             JACK

                 Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck

                 you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of

                 this.  How's that?

                             TYLER

                 Why do you think I blew up your condo?

                             JACK

                 What?

                             TYLER

                 Hitting bottom isn't a weekend

                 retreat!  It's not a seminar!  You

                 have to forget everything you know,

                 everything you think you know --

                 about life, about friendship, about

                 you and me.

     Nearing impact with the oncoming truck, Tyler takes his

     hands off the wheel -- Jack keeps his grip, turns the

     wheel... the car swerves...

     The truck ROARS past, spraying water, HORN BLASTING.

     Tyler looks at Jack, his hands in the air.  Jack looks at

     Tyler with dead eyes.

                             JACK

                 Okay, okay... fine...

     Jack takes his hands off the wheel, holds them in the air.

     Tyler studies Jack face, impressed.  Tyler makes no move to

     take the wheel.

     THROUGH THR WINDSHIELD: a STALLED CAR ahead on the side of

     the road, surrounded by flares.

     Jack and Tyler's eyes stay locked as the car drifts onto the

     shoulder... heading for the stalled car.  Their faces are

     illuminated by the light of the flares.  Tyler smiles.

     They SMASH into the stalled car -- AIRBAGS INFLATE!  The

     back of their car whips around and carries it into a ass-

     over-tea-kettle ROLL down a hill...

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 I'd never been in a car accident.

                 This must've been what all those

                 statistics felt like before I filed

                 them into my reports.

     The car finally hits the bottom, lying on its roof.

     EXT. OVERTURNED CAR

     Tyler crawls from the passenger side.  He walks around...

     opens the driver's side door and drags Jack out into the

     mud.  Ricky and the Mechanic climb out the broken rear

     window.  Tyler sits beside the stunned, wounded Jack.

                             TYLER

                 We just had a near-life experience.

     INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

     Jack lies in bed, traumatized, eyes empty, staring at the

     ceiling.  Tyler sits in a nearby chair.

                             TYLER

                 In the world I see -- you're stalking

                 elk through the damp canyon forests

                 around the ruins of Rockefeller

                 Center.  You will wear leather

                 clothes that last you the rest of

                 your life.  You will climb the wrist-

                 thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears

                 Tower.  You will see tiny figures

                 pounding corn and laying-strips of

                 venison on the empty car pool lane of

                 the ruins of a superhighway.

     Tyler stands, gives Jack's head a pat.

                             TYLER

                       (leaving)

                 Feel better, champ.

     INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

     Jack sits at the table, sips coffee.  He's pale, dazed,

     seems broken.  He hears the faint SOUND of SAWING and

     HAMMERING, unsure of where it's coming from.

     Marla walks into the kitchen and goes straight to the

     counter.  Her back is to Jack as he looks at her.  She pours

     ccffee and lights a cigarette.  A beat of silence, then:

                             MARLA

                 I'll be out of your way in a sec.

     She seems to be as weak as Jack.

                             JACK

                 You... don't have to... leave.

                             MARLA

                 Whatever.

                             JACK

                 Really... I mean it.

                       (pause)

                 Have you been going to your groups?

                             MARLA

                 Chloe's dead.

                             JACK

                 When?

                             MARLA

                 Do you care?

                             JACK

                 I don't know.

                             MARLA

                 It was the smart move on her part.

     Marla turns to face Jack, a grim expression on her face.

     There's a BRUISE on her ARM.  Jack gets up, moves closer.

                             JACK

                 Why are we both... caught up like

                 this... with... ?

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 I came so close to saying Tyler's

                 name, I could feel it vibrate inside

                 my mouth.

     Marla looks a him, waiting.

                             JACK

                 I don't understand.  Why does a weak

                 person have to go out and find a

                 strong person... to hang onto?

                             MARLA

                 What do you get out of it?

     Faint SOUND of SAWING and HAMMERING.  Jack can't quite

     figure where it's coming from.

                             JACK

                 You hear that?

                             MARLA

                 Hear what?

                             JACK

                 That... sawing and hammering.

                             MARLA

                 Have we been talking too long?  Must

                 we change the subject?

     Jack turns -- through the crack of the open basement door,

     Tyler's staring at Jack from the bottom of the stairs.

                             TYLER

                       (harsh whisper)

                 You're not talking about me, are you?

     Jack reacts, turns back to Marla.

                             JACK

                       (to Marla and Tyler)

                 No.

                             MARLA

                 That day you came over to my place to

                 play doctor... what was going on

                 there?

                             TYLER

                       (still a whisper)

                 What are you talking about?

                             JACK

                       (to Marla and Tyler)

                 Nothing.

                             MARLA

                 Nothing?  I don't think so.

                             TYLER

                       (whisper)

                 This conversation...

                             JACK

                 This conversation...

                             TYLER

                 ... is over.

                             JACK

                 ... is over.

     Marla comes to touch Jack's hair.  Jack closes the basement

     door.  Marla sees the kiss-scar on Jack's hand, grabs his

     hand.  Jack tries to pull it back, but Marla keeps a grip.

                             MARLA

                 What is this?  Who did this?

                             JACK

                 ... A person.

                             MARLA

                 Guy or girl?

                             JACK

                 Why would you ask if it's a guy or a

                 girl?!

                             MARLA

                 Why would you get bent if I asked?

                             JACK

                 Let go of me...

                       (pulls his hand free)

                 Leave me alone.

                             MARLA

                 You're afraid to say.

     Marla backs away, closes her eyes, struggling with

     frustration.  She leaves out the back door, not looking back.

     Jack leans against the wall.  After a moment, he opens the

     basement door, heads downstairs...

     INT. BASEMENT STAIRCASE

     Tyler walks upstairs, passing as Jack continues down...

     INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

     Jack looks around.  TRIPLE-DECKER BUNKS clutter the

     basement, as many as can fit into the space.

                             JACK

                       (calling upstairs)

                 Tyler... ?  What's this for?

     From upstairs, the SOUND of the DOORBELL.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

     Jack opens the door.  Ricky stands on the porch, staring

     ahead in subordinate military style.  He's in black pants,

     black shirt, black shoes, holds a PAPER BAG, with an army

     surplus MATTRESS rolled-up at his feet.

                             JACK

                 Um... what can I do for you, Ricky?

     Tyler steps up beside Jack, looks Ricky over.

                             TYLER

                 You're too young.  Sorry.

                             JACK

                 Wait a minute...

     Tyler comes back inside, shuts the door.

                             JACK

                 "Too young?"

                             TYLER

                 If the applicant is young, we tell

                 him he's too young.  Old, too old.

                 Fat, too fat.

                             JACK

                 "Applicant?"

                             TYLER

                 If the applicant waits at the door

                 for three days without food, shelter

                 or encouragement, then he can enter

                 and begin training.

                             JACK

                 "Training?"  Tyler...

     EXT. PORCH - MOMENTS LATER

     Jack comes out, walks around Ricky, hands in his pockets,

     unsure.  Tyler watches, nods for Jack to go ahead.

                             JACK

                 Uh, look.  You're too... young to...

                 train here.  You should probably be

                 on you way.

     No response from Ricky, who remains at attention.  Jack goes

     back inside.  Tyler closes the door.

     EXT. PORCH - NIGHT

     Ricky remains at attention.  Jack bursts out with a BROOM,

     knocks the brown bag out of Ricky's hand, kicks it away.

                             JACK

                 Are you deaf?!  I told you to leave!

                 You will never get inside this house!

     EXT. PORCH - MORNING

     Ricky's still there.  Tyler comes out, friendly.

                             TYLER

                 Look, friend, I'm sorry for the

                 misunderstanding.  It's not the end

                 of the world.  Just go away.  You're

                 trespassing and I will call the

                 police.  Nothing personal.

     EXT. PORCH - NIGHT

     Ricky, same spot.  Jack bursts outside with the broom again.

                             JACK

                 You're never getting through this

                 door, you stupid little weasel!  Look

                 at me when I talk to you... !

     He WHACKS Ricky in the shoulder with the broom.

                             JACK

                 What is your major malfunction!?

     INT. JACK'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     At the window, Tyler sips coffee, watches this scene on the

     PORCH below.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Sooner or later, we all became what

                 Tyler wanted us to be.

     EXT. PORCH - MORNING

     Ricky's there.  Bob is now next to him, in black, with a

     paper bag in hand, mattress at his feet.  Tyler steps out.

     Jack stays in the doorway, locking eyes on Bob.  To all the

     following questions, Ricky answers "Sir!" --

                             TYLER

                 You have two black shirts?  Two pair

                 black trousers?  One pair black

                 boots?  Two pair black socks?  One

                 black coat?  Three hundred dollars

                 personal burial money?  Go inside.

     Ricky goes in.  Tyler turns to Bob.

                             TYLER

                 You're too old.  Sorry.  And, you're

                 too fat.  Nice seeing you.

     Bob looks genuinely hurt.  He picks up his mattress and

     starts away.  Tyler looks at Jack and rolls his eyes.  Jack

     follows Bob...

                             JACK

                 Bob... Bob, wait...

                       (leading Bob back)

                 Let me explain this to you...

     EXT. PORCH -- NIGHT

     CRICKETS CHIRP.  Bob stands at at rigid attention.

     INT. 2ND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT

     Tyler and Jack stand in bathroom doorway, watching Ricky

     finish SHAVING off all of his HAIR.  Tyler comes to give the

     top of Ricky's head a sharp SLAP.

                             TYLER

                 A monkey, ready to be shot into

                 space.  A Space Monkey, ready to

                 sacrifice himself for Project Mayhem.

     From here on, all those with shaved heads: "SPACE MONKEYS."

     EXT. PORCH - DAY

     Jack looks out the window.  Bob stands motionless.  There's

     another "applicant," a SHORT GUY, beside Bob.  Ricky comes

     out the front door with the BROOM...

                             RICKY

                       (to Bob)

                 You're too fucking old, fatty!  We

                 don't want your kind here!

                       (to short guy)

                 You're too short.  Go away, stumpy!

                 Go back to the circus!

     Ricky HITS them with the broom, then goes in, SLAMS THE DOOR.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 So it went...

     EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

     Tyler works with a HALF DOZEN SPACE MONKEYS, preparing the

     square of backyard.  They pull weeds, clear rocks; working

     with shovels, rakes, etc.  They cart away WHEELBARROWS of

     rocks and carry in SACKS of FERTILIZER.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Tyler built his army.

     IN THE KITCHEN WINDOW, Jack watches...

     INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

     Jack keeps watching out the window, eats toast.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 To what purpose, might one ask?

                 Well, one might ask, if not for the

                 first rule of Project Mayhem.

     Jack turns to look around the kitchen.  THREE SPACE MONKEYS

     work -- one SCRUBBING the FLOOR, one WASHING DISHES, one

     SCRUBBING the walls.  Jack walks out.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 In Tyler We Trust.

     INT. JACK'S ROOM - DAY

     Jack opens his eyes, awakening to sunlight thru the window.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 And, then...

     INT. UPSTAIRS LANDING - DAY

     Jack slowly pushes open the door to Tyler's room...

                             JACK

                 Tyler...

     The room is empty.  Jack stares.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 He was gone.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

     Jack comes downstairs... finds DOZENS of SPACE MONKEYS.

     INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Jack enters.  Space Monkeys render fat and make soap.  They

     pinch HERBS, adding them to the mix.  They add VODKA.  Off

     to the side, a couple Monkeys stir a vat of RICE.  On the

     wall is a big bulletin board with HUNDREDS of DRIVER's

     LICENSES; a sign above it: "HUMAN SACRIFICES."

                             FRECKLED SPACE MONKEY

                 "You are not a beautiful and unique

                 snowflake.  You are the same decaying

                 organic matter as everything else.

                 We are all part of the same compost

                 heap."

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Planet Tyler.

     Jack dips a spoon into the rice, chomps on it irritatingly.

                             FRECKLED SPACE MONKEY

                 "We are the all-singing, all-dancing

                 crap of the world."

     Jack picks up a BOTTLE of VODKA.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 I had to hug the walls, trapped

                 inside this clockwork of Space

                 Monkeys, cooking and working and

                 sleeping in teams.

     INT. READING ROOM - NIGHT

     Jack enters, vodka in hand.  TEN SPACE MONKEYS here, reading.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 The house became a living thing, wet

                 inside from so many people sweating

                 and breathing.  So many people

                 moving, the house moved.

     Jack walks out.

     INT. OFFICE - DAY

     Jack enters.  Angel Face reads a book, marks on a chart.

     Space Monkeys shuffle PAPERS and NEWS CLIPPINGS.  Walls are

     lined with FILES, each labeled with a STREET ADDRESS, under

     SIGNS: "Mischief," "Disinformation," "Arson."

     Jack's eye lingers on "Arson." He starts flipping through

     a file.  Angel Face comes to take the file from him.

                             ANGEL FACE

                 That wouldn't interest you.

                             JACK

                 Where's Tyler?

                             ANGEL FACE

                 The first rule of Project --

                             JACK

                 Right, right.

     As Angel Face replaces the file, Jack notices -- a LYE-

     BURNED KISS-SCAR on the back of Angel Face's hand.

     EXT. BACK YARD - NIGHT

     Jack takes a swig of vodka, smokes.  In the BACKGROUND, a

     Space Monkey WHACKS an APPLICANT with a BROOM.  It's a

     ritual; no words.  Other Space Monkeys tend the garden.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 I'm all alone.  I Am Jack's Broken

                 Heart.

     Jack drops his cigarette in the gravel, steps on it.  A

     Space Monkey immediately comes to clean it up.

                             JACK

                 Get away from me!

                             MARLA'S VOICE (O.S.)

                 Who are all these people?

     Jack turns, sees Marla with an overnight bag.

                             JACK

                 The Paper Street Soap Company.

                             MARLA

                 Can I come in?

                             JACK

                 He's not here.

                             MARLA

                 What?

                             JACK

                 He's not here!  Tyler's not here

                 anymore!  He's gone away!

     Marla stares at Jack, miserable.  A tear runs down her

     cheek.  She turns and walks away.  Jack watches her go.

     There's a LOUD COMMOTION from the house, VOICES SHOUTING.

     Jack heads to the back door...

     INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

     Jack enters.  Ricky crawls, bleeding from a gunshot wound to

     the LEG.  Space Monkeys begin a rudimentary job of treating

     the wound.  Other Space Monkeys carry in a DEAD BODY in

     BLACK CLOTHES and SKI MASK, putting it on the table.

                             JACK

                 What's going on?

     Space Monkeys stare at the body.  The Mechanic, sweating,

     gets to his knees and pulls the ski mask off the corpse --

     it's BOB, with a gunshot wound to the HEAD.

                             JACK

                 Bob... oh, Christ...

     Jack pushes past a Space Monkey, stares down, stricken...

                             JACK

                 What... what happened... ?

                             MECHANIC

                       (out of breath)

                 We were on assignment...

     EXT. SCULPTURE PARK - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

     A SCULPTURE adorned with a giant GLOBE on top.

                             MECHANIC (V.O.)

                 We were supposed to kill two birds

                 with one stone:

     A SERIES of EXPLOSIONS blasts the GLOBE free.  It ROLLS...

                             MECHANIC (V.O.)

                 A piece of corporate art...

     The GLOBE ROLLS downhill, to the street -- rolling over one

     parked LUXURY CAR after another, crunching car roofs and

     causing windows to explode...

                             MECHANIC (V.O.)

                 ... and trash a trendy coffee bar.

     Then, the GLOBE arrives at the lobby of a HOTEL...

     BROADSIDES a limo, RICOCHETS... ROLLS directly into the

     front of a closed ARROSTO coffee bar, SMASHING windows...

     DECIMATING coffee push-pats...

     EXT. PARK - AERIAL VIEW - (FLASHBACK CONTINUOUS)

     Bob, the Mechanic and Ricky FLEE, LAUGHING at their

     handiwork.  They split up, running O.S.

                             MECHANIC (V.O.)

                 We had it all worked out, man.  It

                 went smooth... until...

                             HARSH VOICE

                 Police!  Freeze!

     O.S. SOUNDS of GUNSHOTS and FLASHES of MUZZLE FIRE.

     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT - (RESUMING)

     The Mechanic looks up from Bob's corpse.

                             MECHANIC

                 They shot Bob... they shot him in the

                 head.  Those fuckers...

     Jack walks away from Bob's corpse, distraught, holds his

     head, turns to look back, his eyes filling with tears.

                             ANOTHER SPACE MONKEY

                 We gotta do something.

                             RICKY

                 We got to get rid of the evidence.

                 We have to get rid of this body.

                             ANGEL FACE

                 Bury him...

     Jack looks around in disbelief.

                             JACK

                 What... ?

                             ANGEL FACE

                 The garden.  Take him there.  Move,

                 people.  Let's do this!

     Several Space Monkeys gather around Bob's body.

                             JACK

                 No... !

     Space Monkeys stop.  Jack gets between them and Bob, SHOVES

     a few Space Monkeys back...

                             JACK

                 Get your hands off him!  Get off...!

                 What the hell do you think you're

                 doing... ? Evidence?!  This is a

                 man... !  You killed him!

                             ANGEL FACE

                 He was killed in action.

                             JACK

                 No!  Look at you!  You're... you're

                 running around in ski masks,

                 exploding things...

                             ANGEL FACE

                 He was killed serving Project Mayhem.

                             RICKY

                 It's what he would have wanted, sir.

                             JACK

                 What he wanted?  Look... look at him.

                 Look at him!  What does he want?

                       (wipes tears,

                        points at Bob)

                 This is a person.  This is not a cog

                 in your machine...

                             RICKY

                 But, this is Project Mayhem.

                             JACK

                 No, no.  This is a man -- this man

                 has a name...

                             RICKY

                 But, in Project Mayhem, we have no

                 names.

                             JACK

                 No!  Wrong!  This man's name is

                 Robert Paulson.

                             RICKY

                 Robert Paulson?

                             JACK

                 Robert Paulson is dead.  He's dead,

                 because of you...

                             MECHANIC

                 I understand.

     Everyone just stares at Jack.

                             MECHANIC

                 In death, a member of Project Mayhem

                 has a name.

                             JACK

                 No -- !

                             MECHANIC

                 His name is Robert Paulson.

                             RICKY

                 His name is Robert Paulson!

                             JACK

                 No!

                             ALL SPACE MONKEYS

                 His name is Robert Paulson!

                             JACK

                 Stop that -- !

                             ALL SPACE MONKEYS

                       (louder)

                 His name is Robert Paulson!  His name

                 is Robert Paulson...

     Jack backs away, surrounded, PUSHES his way out of the room.

     INT. TYLER'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

     Jack barges in, goes to the desk, rifling through drawers.

     He finds FLIGHT COUPONS, used and unused.  The used coupons.

     have the flight information, including the destination

     cities.  The PHONE RINGS.  Jack answers it...

                             JACK

                 Tyler?

                             DETECTIVE STERN'S VOICE

                       (from phone)

                 This is Detective Stern of the arson

                 unit.  I'd like to see you in my

                 office tomorrow morning...

     Jack, in a panic, HANGS UP.

     INSERT - AN AIRPLANE TAKES OFF...

     INT. PLANE CABIN - DAY

     Jack sits stiffly in a seat.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 I went to the cities on Tyler's used

                 tickets stubs.

     INSERT - A SIGN: "LA GUARDIA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT"

     EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

     Jack hurries from the terminal, runs to a TAXI ...

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 In every city, I branched out from

                 the airport to downtown, bar-

                 hopping...

     INT. TAXI - IN MOTION, MID-CITY - NIGHT

     Jack's looks out the window, intently watching buildings.

                             JACK (V.0.)

                 I didn't know how or why, but I could

                 look at fifty different bars, and

                 somehow I just knew...

                             JACK

                       (to driver, points)

                 Here.  Let me out, right here...

     INT. BAR - NIGHT

     Jack enters.  He sees several MALE PATRONS with FIGHT

     BRUISES.  Jack moves to the bar.  The BARTENDER has a broken

     arm and swollen face.

                             JACK

                 I'm looking for Tyler Durden.

                             BARTENDER

                 Never heard of him.

                             JACK

                 This is an emergency.  It's important

                 I find him.

                             BARTENDER

                 I wish I could help you... sir.

     The bartender WINKS at Jack.

     INSERT - AERIAL VIEW - ATLANTA SKYLINE - NIGHT

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Every city I went to...

     INSERT - AERIAL VIEW - CHICAGO SKYLINE - DAY

                             JACK (V.0.)

                 ...as soon as I set foot off the

                 plane...

     INSERT - AERIAL VIEW - DALLAS SKYLINE - NIGHT

                             JACK (V.).)

                 ...I knew fight club was close.

     INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - NIGHT

     Jack RUNS through the airport, lugging his suitcase.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Tyler was setting up franchises, all

                 over the country.

     INT. DRY CLEANERS - DAY

     The PROPRIETOR, his head bandaged, is confronted by Jack.

                             JACK

                 I need to know where Tyler is.  Can't

                 you help me?

                             BANDAGED PROPRIETOR

                 Sir, you're disturbing the other

                 patrons with your laudish behavior.

                             JACK

                       (pointing)

                 There's no one else here.

                             BANDAGED PROPRIETOR

                 I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest

                 idea what you're talking about.

                             JACK

                 Look at my face.  I'm a member.  I

                 just need to know if you've seen

                 Tyler Durden.

                             BANDAGED PROPRIETOR

                 I'm not disclosed to bespeak any such

                 information to you, nor would I, even

                 if I had said information you want,

                 at this juncture be able.

     Jack looks around, incredibly frustrated.

                             JACK

                  You are a moron.

                             BANDAGED PROPRIETOR

                  I'm afraid I have to insist you leave.

     Jack gives up, shoves his way out the door.

     INT. CITY BUS - DAY

     Jack sits on the bus, looking out the window.  The bus stops.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Under and behind and inside

                 everything I took for granted,

                 something horrible had been growing.

     OUT THE WINDOW, a CONSTRUCTION WORKER with a BROKEN NOSE

     works a jackhammer.  He stops, wipes his brow.

     INT. SPORTS BAR - DAY

     TVs show football.  Jack is seated with TWO BRUISED PATRONS.

                             BRUISED PATRON #1

                 No one's ever seen him.  No one knows

                 what he looks like.

                             BRUISED PATRON #2

                 He has facial reconstructive surgery

                 every three years.

                             JACK

                 That's the stupidest thing I've ever

                 heard.

                             BRUISED PATRON #1

                 Is it true about fight club in Miami?

                             BRUISED PATRON 12

                 Is Mr. Durden building an army?

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Am I asleep... ?

     INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

     Jack sits awake.  Everyone around him is asleep.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Have I slept?  I'm not sure if Tyler

                 is my bad dream or if I'm Tyler's.

     EXT. MID-TOWN STREETS - DAY

     Jack steps off the sidewalk, hailing a TAXI...

     EXT. CITY ALLEY - DAY

     The alleyway's deserted.  Jack heaft to rusty CELLAR DOORS.

     He opens the doors, looks around, heads down stairs...

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 I was living in a state of perpetual

                 deja vu.

     INT. DANK BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

     Jack enters this dark basement, walks ahead in the dim

     light.  The place is damp and empty.  Jack stops, looks down.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Everywhere I went, I felt I had

                 already been there.

     At his feet -- DRIED BLOOD on the concrete floor.

     INSERT - AERIAL VIEW - PHOENIX SKYLINE - DAY

     INT. ANOTHER BAR - DAY

     Jack walks in.  The place is empty.  He walks to a KITCHEN

     DOOR, opens it and peers in at... a GROUP of KITCHEN WORKERS

     solemnly stand in a circle, chanting...

                             KITCHEN WORKERS

                 His name is Robert Paulson.  His name

                 is Robert Paulson...

                             MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

                       (from behind Jack)

                 Welcome back, sir.

     Jack whirls, startled -- facing the wounded BARTENDER, who

     wears a NECK BRACE, his nose a smashed eggplant.

                             WOUNDED BARTENDER

                 How have you been?

                             JACK

                 ... You know me?

                             WOUNDED BARTENDER

                 Is this a test, sir?

                             JACK

                 Yes... it's a test.

                             WOUNDED BARTENDER

                 You were in here last Thursday night.

                             JACK

                 What?

                             WOUNDED BARTENDER

                 You were standing right where you are

                 now, asking how good our security is.

                 It's tight as a drum.

                             JACK

                 Who do you think I am?

                             WOUNDED BARTENDER

                 Is this part of the test?

     Jack nods slowly.  The Bartender holds up his hand, shows

     the KISS SCAR on the back of his hand...

                             WOUNDED BARTENDER

                 You're the one who did this to me.

                 You're Mr. Durden, sir.  Tyler Durden.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Please return your seatbacks to their

                 full upright and locked position.

     INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

     Jack bursts inside, out of breath, runs to grab the phone,

     punches a number, doesn't bother to turn on the lamp.

     INTERCUT WITH...

     INT. MARLA'S ROOM - SAME

     Marla answers.

                             MARLA

                 Yeah?

                             JACK

                 Marla, it's me.  Have we... have we

                 ever had sex?

                             MARLA

                 What kind of stupid question is

                 that?!

                             JACK

                 Because the answer's "yes" or because

                 the answer's "no?"

                             MARLA

                 Is this a trick?

                             JACK

                 Will you just answer me, for

                 Christsake?!

                             MARLA

                 You mean, you want to know if I think

                 we were just having sex or making

                 love?

                             JACK

                 We did make love?

                             MARLA

                 Is that what you're calling it?

                             JACK

                 Answer the question!

                             MARLA

                 You fuck me, then snub me.  You love

                 me, you hate me.  You show me your

                 sensitive side, then you turn into a

                 total asshole!  Is that a pretty

                 accurate description of our

                 relationship, Tyler?

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 We've just lost cabin pressure.

                             JACK

                 What did you say... ?

                             MARLA

                 What is wrong with you?

                             JACK

                 Say my name.

                             MARLA

                 What... ?

                             JACK

                 Say my name!  What's my name!?

                             MARLA

                 Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you

                 fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm

                 coming over there...

                             JACK

                 Marla, no, wait...

     As Marla HANGS UP.  Jack stares at the receiver, dazed...

                             TYLER'S VOICE

                 We've got six fight clubs in Chicago

                 now...

     Jack spins, dropping the phone -- TYLER sits beside him.

                             TYLER

                 Four in Milwaukee.

                             JACK

                 What's this all about, Tyler?

                             TYLER

                 And, we're definitely filling a void

                 in the rural South.

                             JACK

                 Why do people think I'm you?

                             TYLER

                 You broke your promise.  You talked

                 to her about me.

                             JACK

                 Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?

                             TYLER

                 Why did you do that?

                             JACK

                 Answer me, Tyler.

                             TYLER

                 Why do people think anything?

                             JACK

                 I don't know!  Tell me!

     Tyler shakes his head in disgust, extremely irritated.

                             TYLER

                 People think that you're me, because

                 you and I happen to share the same

                 body.

                             JACK

                 What... ?

                             TYLER

                 Is this really news to you?

                             JACK

                 What are you talking about... ?

                             TYLER

                 Sometimes I control it, and you

                 imagine yourself watching me...

     FLASHBACK - LOU'S BAR BASEMENT - NIGHT

     JACK stands surrounded by eager fight club MEMBERS, under

     the bare bulb, talking and behaving like Tyler...

                             JACK

                 The first rule of fight club is --

                 you don't talk about fight club.

     FLASHBACK - EXT. PAPER STREET HOUSE - DAY

     Jack stands in the yard, VODKA in hand, yells at Marla.

                             JACK

                 He's not here!  Tyler's not here

                 anymore!  He's gone away!

                 one else can...

     FLASHBACK - CURBSIDE - NIGHT

     JACK sits alone on the curb, watching the nearby freeway.

     He talks to someone beside him, but nobody's there.

                             JACK

                 Anyone?

                       (thinks)

                 My boss, probably.

                       (pause)

                 Who would you fight?

     Jack listens, looks at the empty space beside him.

                             JACK

                 Oh, yeah.

                       (nodding)

                 I didn't really know my Dad...

                             TYLER

                 I go places without you.  Get things

                 done...

     FLASHBACK - BUILDING - NIGHT

     The Parker Morris Building.

     JACK, Bob, Ricky, Angel Face and another GUY rappel down the

     side, SPRAYING PAINT.  JACK is "TYLER" in demeanor,

     mannerisms, speech...

                             JACK

                       (shouting)

                 You are not your job.  You are not

                 how much money you have in the bank.

     TWO WINDOWS SHATTER OUTWARD -- TWO MEN look out and yell:

                             BRUISED MAN #1

                 I am not my job!

                             BRUISED MAN #2

                 I am not how much money I have in the

                 bank!

     INT. HOTEL ROOM - RESUMING

     Jack's having trouble catching his breath.  Tyler stands.

                             TYLER

                 There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing

                 from you... one simple promise.  Now

                 look what you've done!

                             JACK

                 This isn't possible...

                             TYLER

                 We're going to have to do something

                 about Marla...

                             JACK

                 What... what are you saying?

                             TYLER

                 It's okay.  We okay... a little

                 codependent, sure, but...

     Jack shakes his head in disbelief, in denial...

                             JACK

                 No!  This isn't true.  We... we were

                 around other people, together, both

                 of us...

                                  TYLER

                 You never talked to me in front of

                 anyone else.

                             JACK

                 Wrong, wrong -- what about the car

                 crash... the two guys in the backseat?

                             TYLER

                 What about them?  They're lunatics.

                             JACK

                 You took me to the house.

                             TYLER

                 The house is rented in your name.

                             JACK

                 You have jobs.

                             TYLER

                 Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.

                             JACK

                 What about Marla?

                             TYLER

                 What about Marla?

                             JACK

                 She's... you... you're fucking her.

                             TYLER

                 Um, well... technically, no.

     Jack stands, trying to absorb, feeling ill, trying to find

     words, then -- he suddenly FAINTS to the floor, OUT COLD.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 It's called a "changeover."  The

                 movie goes on, and nobody in the

                 audience has any idea.

     INT. HOTEL ROOM - PRE-DAWN

     Jack's eyes snap open.  He sits up, alone.  He remembers the

     previous night... looks at himself in the mirror... looks at

     the clock -- 4:35am.

     INT. HALLWAY

     The room door SLAMS OPEN as Jack bursts out of the room,

     carrying his suitcase, SPRINTING for the STAIRWELL...

     INT. STAIRWELL

     Jack races down, three steps at a time, dragging his

     suitcase - BOOM, BOOM, BOOM - behind him...

     INT. LOBBY

     Jack hurries to the front door, his suitcase half-broken

     open, passing the front desk.  A DESK CLERK calls after him.

                             DESK CLERK

                 Sir... sir?  Are you checking out?

                             JACK

                 Yes.

     The clerk follows the length of the counter, waves a PAPER.

                             DESK CLERK

                 Please initial this list of phone

                 calls.

                             JACK

                 Bill me!

     Jack goes out the door, freezes.  He rushes back in, going

     to the desk -- snatches the bill, studies it: many NUMBERS.

                             JACK

                 Wait...when were these made?

                             DESK CLERK

                 It says right there, sir... between

                 two and three-thirty this morning.

     Jack looks at the clerk, at the bill, at the clerk.

                             JACK

                 I need a copy of this.

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - IN FLIGHT - DAY

     Jack stares out the window, his face set hard.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Had I been going to bed earlier every

                 night?  Have I been sleeping later?

                 Has Tyler been in charge longer and

                 longer?

     EXT. PAPER STREET - DAY

     A TAXI halts.  Jack leaps out, points to the GRUNGY CABBIE.

                             JACK

                 Wait here.

     INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE, LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

     Jack walks in to find the place EMPTY and DESERTED.  He

     continues on into the KITCHEN, gawks at BATHTUBS and

     CANISTERS holding vast amounts of liquid.  There are HOSES,

     GAS MASKS, BEAKERS, TEST TUBES and PUMPS.

     He picks up a BOTTLE labeled "NITRIC ACID."

     INT. TYLER'S ROOM

     Jack sits by the PHONE, pulls out the HOTEL BILL, runs his

     finger up and down the list of PHONE NUMBERS...

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Deja vu, all over again...

     Jack finger stops on a NUMBER.  He dials, phone to his ear.

                             VOICE

                       (from phone)

                 Eighteen-eighty-eight.

     Jack sees a file on the wall: "1888 CENTURY PARK EAST."

                             JACK

                 Who is this?

                             VOICE

                 Maintenance.

                             JACK

                 Listen, something is going to happen,

                 something terrible...

                             VOICE

                 Very good, Sir.

                             JACK

                 Excuse me?

                             VOICE

                 Don't worry about us, sir.  We're

                 solid.

                             JACK

                 Now wait, there's been a mix-up.

                 Everything's changed...

                             VOICE

                 You told me you'd say that.

                             JACK

                 Abort the plan.

                             VOICE

                 You told me you'd say that, too.

                             JACK

                 Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist

                 dickhead?!

                             VOICE

                 Well, sir, you said you might.

     Jack HANGS UP, desperately dials the next number on the bill.

                             DIFFERENT VOICE

                       (front phone)

                 Twenty-one-sixty.  Maintenance.

     Jack sees a file: "2160 PICO BOULEVARD."  He throws the

     phone, pocketing the bill.  He grabs up all the FILES.

     EXT. MARLA'S HOTEL - SUNSET

     Jack's TAXI halts.  Marla walks out of the lobby doors, sees

     Jack getting out of the cab, laden with files...

                             JACK

                 Marla!

     Marla makes a sharp turn, walking away.  Jack follows,

     hugging the files to his chest, catching up.

                             JACK

                 Marla...

                             MARLA

                 Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me

                 with a fucking broom.  I thought they

                 were going to break my arm.

                             JACK

                 I'm sorry, I...

                             MARLA

                 The were burning their fingertips

                 with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.

                             JACK

                 Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's

                 going to take a tremendous act of

                 faith on your part for you to hear me

                 out.

                             MARLA

                 Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.

     Marla heads into a DINER.  Jack follows...

                             JACK

                 -- A little more faith than that.

     INT. DINER - MOMENTS LATER

     Marla sits in a BOOTH.  Jack sits across from her.

                             MARLA

                 I don't want to hear anything you've

                 got to say.

                             JACK

                 Give me a minute, Marla, alright...

                 just sixty seconds.

                             MARLA

                 Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.

                             JACK

                 Absolutely, you have every right.  I

                 need you to do me a favor.

                             MARLA

                 I've done you enough favors.

     A WAITER with a BLACK EYE appears at the table.

                             WAITER

                 Sir!  Anything you order is free of

                 charge, sir.

                             MARLA

                 Why is it free of charge?

                             JACK

                 Because... I'm Tyler Durden.

                             MARLA

                 Then, I'll have the clam chowder...

                 fried chicken and a baked potato with

                 everything and a chocolate chiffon

                 pie.

     Jack look to the pass-through WINDOW into the kitchen where

     THREE COOKS look out with STITCHES in their faces.

                             JACK

                 Clean food, please.

                             WAITER

                 In that case, sir, may I advise

                 against the lady eating the clam

                 chowder?

                             JACK

                 Thanks, no clam chowder.  That's it.

     The waiter snaps to attention and leaves.

                             MARLA

                 You got about thirty seconds.

                             JACK

                       (takes a deep breath)

                 I know that I've been... unwell.  I

                 know it's been like there's two sides

                 to me.

                             MARLA

                 Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr.

                 Jackass.

                             JACK

                 I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've

                 only just realized

                             MARLA

                 What?

                             JACK

                 I mean, the depth and breadth of our

                 relationship has only recently been

                 illuminated for me.  I know this...

                 I know us hasn't been such a great

                 thing for you...

                             MARLA

                 Whatever.

                       (to waiter)

                 I'll take my food to go...

     Marla's getting up to go, but Jack rises, fed up, takes her

     by the arm, putting her back in her seat.

                             JACK

                 Sit down!  Sit down and give me my

                 last fifteen seconds without opening

                 your mouth!

     Marla crosses her arms.  Jack collects himself.

                             JACK

                 I'm trying to tell you -- and this is

                 where you have to trust me -- but, I

                 think your life might be in real

                 danger.

                             MARLA

                 What?

                             JACK

                 You have to get out of here.  Leave

                 as soon as possible.  Go to any rural

                 town, away from any major city...

                             MARLA

                 You are an insane person.

                             JACK

                 Marla...

                             MARLA

                 No, no, shut up!  I've had enough.

                 I tried, Tyler... I have tried...

     Marla's getting upset, tears coming to her eyes.

                             MARLA

                 There's a part of you I really like,

                 but I can't do this anymore.  I just

                 can't.  This is killing me...

                             JACK

                 I'm sorry, but I...

                             MARLA

                 What?!  You're sorry?  I don't

                 believe that for a minute.

     Marla gets up.  Jack grabs for her, but she's gone, heading

     for the door.  Jack gathers his files, runs to follow...

     EXT. DINER - MOMESTS LATER

     Jack pushes out the door, files under one arm, catching up...

                             JACK

                 I can't explain.  You wouldn't

                 believe me anyway.  I'm trying to

                 protect you...

     Jack grabs her arm, tries to hail a TAXI, but the taxi races

     past.  Marla pulls free, screaming at him...,

                             MARLA

                 Let go of me!

                             JACK

                 Do this for me, Marla.  Do this for

                 me, if you never do anything else...

     Jack spots a BUS idling further up the street.

                             MARLA

                 Leave me alone!  I don't ever want to

                 see you again!

                             JACK

                 Okay, if that's what it takes, you'll

                 never have to see me again.

                       (digs in his pocket)

                 Here... here...

     He pulls MONEY from his pocket, holding it out.

                             JACK

                 Take this money, get on this bus...

                       (pointing to bus)

                 Get on, and I promise you, I'll never

                 bother you again, if that's what you

                 want.  Please...

     Marla looks at Jack, numb.

                             MARLA

                 Tyler...

                             JACK

                 I'm begging you.  Get on the bus.

                 Get on the bus.

     Marla takes the money from Tyler, walks towards the bus.  As

     they approach it, Jack shields his eyes, afraid to look...

                             MARLA

                 Why are you doing this?

                             JACK

                 I can't let myself see where you're

                 going.  Go wherever it takes you,

                 remember... keep away from major

                 cities...

     Marla stands at the doors of the bus, heartbroken, gives one

     last look at Jack.

                             MARLA

                       (holds up the money)

                 I'm not paying this back.  I consider

                 it "asshole tax."

                             JACK

                 Yes, fine.  Just, get on.  Stay away

                 a couple of weeks, at least.

     Jack's still covering his eyes.  Marla gets on the bus.

                             MARLA

                 Tyler...

     Jack finally looks to her.

                             MARLA

                 You are the worst thing that ever

                 happened to me.

     DOORS HISS SHUT.  The BUS LEAVES, heading away.  Jack seems

     relieved.  Then, a SCREAM is HEARD from MARLA...

     Jack turns, looks... THROUGH THE BUS WINDOWS: the bus is

     filled with BALD MEN IN BLACK: Space Monkeys.

     Jack SPRINTS after the bus...

     The bus speeds away.  Onboard, Space Monkeys subdue Marla.

     Jack falls to the asphalt, rolls, files-flying.

                             JACK

                 Son of a bitch!

     INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

     Jack RUNS to the front desk, crazed, dumps the armload of

     files on the desk in front of the DESK SERGEANT...

                             JACK

                       (loudly)

                 I want you to arrest me.  I'm the

                 leader of a terrorist organization

                 responsible for acts of vandalism all

                 over the city.  Detective Stern in

                 arson knows who I am...

     INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

     Detective Stern and THREE DETECTIVES stand, staring at Jack,

     who's seated.  On the table are the phone bill and files.

                             JACK

                 There are probably several hundred

                 members in the metropolitan area.

                 Chapters are sprouting in at least

                 five other major cities.  They're

                 tightly-regimented, with many cells

                 capable of operating without a

                 central leader.  Check this address:

                 1537 Paper Street.  You'll find the

                 body of Robert Paulson buried in the

                 garden.  You'll also find numerous

                 tubs used to make gallons of

                 nitroglycerin.  The plan, I believe,

                 is to blow up these credit card

                 headquarters and the TRW building.

                             STERN

                 Why these buildings?

                             JACK

                 You are not your job.  You are not

                 how much money you have in the bank.

                             STERN

                       (to other detectives)

                 Keep him talking.

     Stern leaves.  A beat, then, the remaining Detectives smile

     at Jack with REVERENCE.

                             FLAT-TOP DETECTIVE

                 I really admire what you're doing.

                 You're a brave man to order this.

                             JACK

                 What?

                             REDHEAD DETECTIVE

                 You're a genius, sir.

     They grab Jack and force him on his back on the table.

     Flat-Top has a rubber band; the Bald Detective has a knife.

                             BALD DETECTIVE

                 You know the drill.  You said if

                 anyone ever tries to interfere with

                 Project Mayhem, even you, we got to

                 get his balls.

     Flat-Top PULLS Jack's pants completely off, tosses them

     aside.  Jack SCREAMS.  Flat-Top holds his legs.

                             FLAT-TOP

                 It's useless to fight.

                             REDHEAD

                 This is really a powerful gesture,

                 Mr. Durden.  It'll set quite an

                 example.

                             JACK

                 No... you're making a mistake!

                             FLAT-TOP

                 You told us you'd say that.

                             JACK

                 I'm not Tyler Durden!

                             BALDY

                 You told us you'd say that, too.

                             JACK

                 Okay, I am Tyler Durden and I'm

                 ordering you to abort the mission!

                             FLAT-TOP

                 You said you would definitely say

                 that.

                             BALDY

                 What's our best time for a "cut and

                 run?"

                             FLAT-TOP

                 Four minutes.

                             BALDY

                 Is somebody timing this?

                             REDHEAD

                       (looks at his watch)

                 Wait till the second hand gets to the

                 twelve.

     A KNOCK at the door.  Flat-Top slaps a hand over Jack's

     mouth.  He and Redhead block view of the table as Baldy

     opens the door a crack.  Stern mutters:

                             STERN

                 Some of this info checks out.  Let's

                 go to the place on Paper Street.

     Baldy glances back at the other Detectives, leaves, closing

     the door.  The two remaining Detectives continue.  Jack kicks

     and screams and writhes.  The Detectives wrangle him, but

     with more difficulty, now that Baldy's gone.

                             REDHEAD

                       (checking his watch)

                 Mr. Durden, you're going to fuck up

                 the time!

     Jack gets one leg free, KICKS, knocks Flat-top backwards --

     Flat-Top SLAMS the wall, falls.  Redhead lets go of one of

     Jack's arms, jams his elbow into Jack's throat... cutting

     off the airway.  Jack's face reddens... he's choking...

     Jack's free hand reaches, searching.. pulls Redhead's GUN

     and points it at him.  Redhead backs off. Jack gets up,

     gasping for air, PISTOL-WHIPS Flat-top as he rises.

     Jack grabs one of the files off the table.

     EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

     Jack, without pants, in BOXER SHORTS, escapes out the BACK

     DOOR.  He looks at the ADDRESS on the file folder.

     EXT. STREET

     Jack SPRINTS down the middle of the street, gun in hand,

     looking like a complete madman.  Cars almost hit him.

     EXT. BANK BUILDING - LATER

     Jack, sweating and panting, stops, looks... then heads

     toward the BUILDING with the address "1888."

     EXT. 1888 LOBBY

     Jack tries the door.  Locked.  He lifts a cast iron bench,

     runs forward -- RAMS it into the glass.  The bench

     immediately recoils from the glass, SLAMS Jack's groin!

     Jack falls to his knees, doubled over, holding his package.

     Then, he rises, SHOOTS the glass...

     INT. 1888 LOBBY

     Jack pushes through the broken glass.  He sprints for the

     "PARKING" door...

     INT. GROUND LEVEL - PARKING

     Jack enters, looks -- NO CARS.  He bolts to the STAIRS...

     INT. TOP-LEVEL PARKING AREA - SEVENTH FLOOR

     Jack enters, heaving.  Again, NO CARS.  He moves from one

     SUPPORT POST to another, searching.  He finally spies,

     across the garage, NINE LARGE CANISTERS, heavily-WIRED.

     Jack runs to the BOMB, frantic.  He walks around it.

     There's a DIGITAL CLOCK, ticking down from "10:05"...

     Jack moves to pull the lid off one CANISTER, looks inside..

                             TYLER

                 Could be worse...

     Jack looks -- Tyler's seated, his back against one post.

                             TYLER

                 You could be standing under 37

                 stories of steel and concrete with a

                 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped

                 to the support... oh, maybe it

                 couldn't be...

                             JACK

                       (points at bomb)

                 You... you can't be serious about

                 this.

                             TYLER

                 What a ridiculous thing to say.

                             JACK

                 I can't let you...

                             TYLER

                              ...go through with this?

                 What are you going to do?

                             JACK

                 I'm going to...

                             TYLER

                           ...stop me?

                             JACK

                 I'm not going...

                             TYLER

                            ...to let this happen!

                             JACK

                 Stop finishing...

                             TYLER

                         ...your sentences!  They're

                 our sentences.  Get your mind around

                 that.

     Tyler gets up walks to Jack.

                             TYLER

                 What are you doing running through

                 the streets in your underpants?  We

                 both use that body.

                             JACK

                 Since when is Project Mayhem about

                 murder?

                             TYLER

                 The buildings were evacuated thirty

                 minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding

                 exactly as planned.

                             JACK

                 You don't know that.  There could

                 still be people inside.

     Tyler keeps walking around, crosses his arms.

                             TYLER

                 Maybe.  Maybe a couple of guys with

                 shaved heads couldn't synchronize

                 their watches.  Good riddance.

     Jack looks back to the BOMB, goes to it, wipes sweat off his

     face.  He starts finger the MANY WIRES, sorting them.

                             TYLER

                 I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you

                 know which wires, in what order...

                             JACK

                 If you know, I know.

     Jack holds his gun under one armpit, uses both hands to go

     through the tangle of colored wires.

                             TYLER

                 Or... maybe I knew you'd know, so I

                 spent the whole day thinking about

                 the wrong ones.

     Jack chooses one wire, GREEN, holds it in his fingers.

                             JACK

                 If I'm wrong, we're both dead..

                             TYLER

                 This is not about martyrdom.

     Jack twists the GREEN WIRE around his finger.

                             JACK

                 I'm pulling the green wire.

                             TYLER

                 Green?  Did you say green?

     Tyler comes a little closer, leaning to try to get a look,

     seems genuinely concerned.

                             JACK

                 Yes...

                             TYLER

                 Don't pull the green wire.  Pull

                 anything but the green wire.

                             JACK

                 Fuck you.

                             TYLER

                 I'm serious.  That's the wrong one.

     Jack's unsure, swallowing, pulling the wire taunt, fingers

     trembling.  The SOUND of a VEHICLE is HEARD from below...

                             TYLER

                 Hear that?  Marla's here.  Just in

                 the nick of time, eh?

     Jack looks to Tyler.  Tyler points towards the SOUND...

                             TYLER

                 See for yourself.

     Jack releases the wire, walks to a RAILING, gun in hand,

     keeps an eye on Tyler.  Jack looks over the railing...

     BELOW, a BUS idles.  The doors open and MARLA'S dragged out,

     kicking and screaming, carried by SIX SPACE MONKEYS...

                             MARLA

                 You motherfuckers...

     They carry Marla into the BUILDING'S ENTRANCE.

     Jack leans against the railing, exhausted.

                             TYLER

                 I've got everything.  The bombs.  The

                 army.  I've got Marla.

                             JACK

                 Bob is dead, Tyler.  The police blew

                 a hole in his head.  Was that part of

                 your plan?

     Tyler thinks, shrugs.

                             TYLER

                 Bob was a grown man.  In any great

                 struggle, there will be casualties.

                 Wouldn't that be implicit in the

                 name?  Project "Mayhem."

                             JACK

                 Fuck your struggle.  I want out.

                             TYLER

                 You want out?

                             JACK

                 I quit.

                             TYLER

                 Not an option, for the most obvious

                 of reasons.  You need to get with the

                 program.

                       (looks at his watch)

                 Seven minutes.  Let's get out of here.

     Tyler's walks away.  Jack looks at the gun in his hand.  He

     points the gun at Tyler...

                             JACK

                 Tyler...

                             TYLER

                       (still walking away)

                 What?

                             JACK

                       (COCKS the gun)

                 Defuse the bomb.

     Tyler stops walking.

                             TYLER

                 Ask me nicely.

                             JACK

                 Defuse the bomb, please.

                             TYLER

                 Defuse the bomb?

                             JACK

                 Yes.

     Tyler strides towards the BOMB.  Jack trains the gun...

                             JACK

                 Please.

     Tyler looks at the BOMB, reaches over to it.  He grips the

     GREEN WIRE, yanks it out -- the CLOCK STOPS.

     Jack lowers his gun.

                             TYLER

                 I did that for you.  As a gesture.

                 Now, how fast can you run?  There are

                 ten other bombs, in ten other

                 buildings in the immediate area.  If

                 you're going to get them all, you

                 better get cracking.

                       (looks at watch)

                 Six minutes.  Green wires, remember.

                 I'll be upstairs.

     Jack's stunned.  Tyler walks across the parking garage, past

     Jack, heading for the STAIRS.

     Jack aims the gun at Tyler's back, FIRES!

     Tyler ducks to one side, impossibly quick, avoiding...

     Tyler spins to face Jack.

                             TYLER

                 Whoa!  What was that all about?

     Jack aims... FIRES!

     Tyler DODGES behind a post as the BULLET THROWS CONCRETE.

     Jack edges forward, gun held in both hands, moves around the

     post... Tyler is NOT THERE.  Jack turns, takes slow steps,

     moving the gun from side to side...

     Suddenly, a FIST ENTERS FRAME -- SLUGS Jack's face.

     Jack falls.  The gun goes CLATTERING across the floor...

     Jack turns, looking... Tyler's GONE.  Jack looks to the gun,

     scrambles to his feet, running to pick up the gun...

     Tyler KICKS Jack in the chest, sends Jack sprawling.

     Jack rolls, holding his chest.  He looks up, sees Tyler run

     into the STAIRWELL.  Jack grabs the gun and follows...

     INT. STAIRWELL

     Jack smashes the door open.  The stairwell's empty.  Jack

     RUNS up a flight of stairs, kicks open ANOTHER DOOR...

     INT. MAIN LOBBY

     Jack steps forward, gun up... TWO INTERLOCKED HANDS SLAM

     down onto his head.  Jack drops to the floor.

     Tyler backs away, laughing.  Jack gets to his feet, aims his

     gun...

                             TYLER

                 Fire at will.

     Jack clenches his teeth, FIRING -- nothing happens to Tyler.

     Jack FIRES TWICE -- no effect.  Tyler raises his arms.

                             TYLER

                 What did you expect?

     Jack charges.  Tyler dodges, PUNCHES, knocks the gun out of

     Jack's hand.  They FIGHT, trading PUNCHES, grappling, taking

     each other to the floor...

                                                      CUT TO:

     INT. SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

     Banks of SECURITY MONITORS sit unmanned.

     ON ONE MONITOR: Jack is seen in the lobby, on the floor,

     alone, wrestling himself.  He swings his left hand up,

     punching empty air, then swings his right hand -- PUNCHING

     himself in the side of the head...

     INT. MAIN LOBBY

     Tyler and Jack fight viciously, bloodied.  Tyler manages to

     get his hands around Jack's throat, starts BANGING Jack's

     head against the floor...

     SECURITY MONITOR P.O.V.

     ... Jack's got his hands around his own throat, BANGING his

     own head against the floor, over and over...

     INT. MAIN LOBBY

     Jack manages to break Tyler's grip, KICKS Tyler away.

     Tyler springs to his feet, RUNS, heading for a STAIRCASE.

     Jack gets up, breathing hard, holding his head, follows...

     ON THE STAIRS, Tyler reaches the LOFT LEVEL, above the

     lobby, disappears around a corner.  Jack's right behind,

     turning the corner -- Tyler's NOT THERE.

     Jack receives a SHARP SLAP on the back of the head.  He

     wheels.  Tyler isn't there.  A TAP on his shoulder.  Jack

     turns around -- WHAM! -- Tyler PUNCHES his face.  Jack falls

     against the loft railing.  Tyler comes forward, SWINGS...

     SECURITY MONITOR P.O.V.

     Jack PUNCHES himself square in the nose!

     INT. MAIN LOBBY

     Jack's dazed.  Tyler grabs Jack's shirt, pulls him forward,

     SWINGS HIM -- THROWS him DOWN THE STAIRS...

     Jack TUMBLES horribly down... HITS BOTTOM, striking his head

     on the floor.  Jack PASSES OUT...

                                                     FADE TO BLACK:

     INT. LARGE SOCIAL ROOM - TOP FLOOR

     CLOSE ON: Jack's head jerks back as he SNAPS AWAKE.  He

     looks around, trying to focus his eyes...

     JACK'S P.O.V. -- TRACKS in the sawdust of the floor, from

     where his body was dragged across to where he is how.

     CLOSE ON: Jack tries to comprehend.  He turns his head --

     TYLER'S HAND brings the GUN up, PUTS THE GUN IN JACK'S

     MOUTH.  Jack freezes, looks around with his eyes...

                                                      PULL BACK TO:

     Tyler is seated in Jack's lap.  Tyler holds the gun in

     Jack's mouth, his arm around him.  This huge room is being

     remodeled.  Tyler and Jack are seated near floor-to-ceiling

     windows affording a spectacular view of the CITY.

     Tyler looks at his watch.

                             TYLER

                 One minute.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 I think this is about where we came

                 in.

                             TYLER

                       (looking out window)

                 This is the beginning.  We're at

                 ground zero.  Maybe you should say a

                 few words, to mark the occasion.

                             JACK

                 i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...

     Jack tongues the barrel to the side of his mouth.

                             JACK

                       (still distorted)

                 I still can't think of anything.

     Tyler checks his watch.

                             TYLER

                 It's getting exciting now.

     Jack turns, so he can see down -- 31 STORIES.

                             TYLER

                 Look what we've accomplished.

                       (checks watch)

                 Thirty seconds.

                       (looks out windows)

                 Out these windows, we will view the

                 economic collapse.  One step closer

                 to global equilibrium.  I'm glad

                 you're here with me.

     Tyler watches the skyline, WHISTLES at tune, waiting.

                             JACK

                       (distorted)

                 Can't you call it off... ?

                             TYLER

                 It's out of our hands.

                       (looks at watch)

                 This is it.

                             JACK

                 Please...

                             TYLER

                 Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see

                 alright?  10... 9... 8....

     Tyler looks out the windows, at SURROUNDING BUILDINGS,

     excited.  Jack closes his eyes, despairing.

                             TYLER

                 5... 4... 3... 2...

     Out the window, the SKYLINE remains unchanged.  Nothing.  A

     long beat.  A very dark scowl comes over Tyler's face.

     Jack opens his eyes.  More waiting.  Tyler looks genuinely

     surprised, pissed-off.

                             TYLER

                 What the fuck -- ?

                             JACK

                 Paraffin.

                             TYLER

                 What?

                             JACK

                       (relieved)

                 Paraffin.  Your merry band mixed the

                 nitro with paraffin.  I saw it

                 floating in the bomb.

                             (more)

                             JACK (cont)

                 They must've run out of cotton and

                 Epsom salt.  Paraffin is iffy at best.

     Tyler rises, taking the gun from Jack's mouth, starts

     pacing.  Jack rubs his sore jowls, allows himself a smile.

                             TYLER

                 Damn it!  God-damn it...

                             JACK

                 Not exactly according to plan.

                             TYLER

                 Do we have to do everything

                 ourselves?!

     Tyler stops walking, lets out a sigh of disgust.  He reaches

     into his pocket, taking out a WALKIE TALKIE.

                             TYLER

                       (into WALKIE TALKIE)

                 ... Codename Rooster.  Passcode First

                 Strike...

     Jack's eyes go wide.

                             JACK

                 NO...

                             TYLER

                       (into WALKIE TALKIE)

                 Proceed with remote detonation.

     Jack leaps -- TACKLES Tyler.  The GUN is knocked away.  Jack

     STRIKES Tyler's face repeatedly with his elbow, scrambles

     off...

     Jack gets the gun, turns, pointing it.  Tyler's getting to

     his feet, sees the gun, annoyed.  Jack stands.

                             TYLER

                 Haven't we already done this?

     Jack SHOOTS TWICE.  Bullets pass right thorough Tyler.

     Tyler just rolls his eyes, drops the walkie-talkie to the

     floor and STOMPS on it, CRUSHING it.

                             JACK

                       (pointing)

                 How'd you do that?!  You're a fucking

                 figment of my imagination... you're

                 psychogenic fugue state...

                             TYLER

                 Fuck that, maybe you're my

                 hallucination.

     Jack falters, pointing at Tyler's feet.  There's no walkie-

     talkie there.  Jack looks down, sees the WALKIE-TALKIE

     CRUSHED under his own foot.

                             JACK

                 Oh... Christ...

     Jack holds his head, walks around, at his wit's end.

                             JACK

                 Why... why... why... ?

                             TYLER

                 Why what?

                             JACK

                 Why can't I get rid of you?  Why

                 can't I just wish you away?

                             TYLER

                 You need me.

                             JACK

                 No, no, I don't.

                       (pause)

                 I thank you, I really do.  Thank you,

                 but I don't need you anymore.

                             TYLER

                 Look, I can be selfish, I know that.

                       (pause)

                 I'm not blind to my own failings...

                             JACK

                 Noooo, please...

     Jack backs up against a window, numb and weary.

                             TYLER

                 From now on, we'll share Marla.

                 We've been spending too much time

                 apart...

                             JACK

                 ... no, no, no...

                             TYLER

                 No more running off without you.

                 From here on out, we do it together.

                             JACK

                 Why are you doing this?!

                             TYLER

                 I'm doing this for us.

                             JACK

                 Please understand... I've gotten all

                 I can from this, Tyler.

                             TYLER

                       (sullen)

                 If I leave, you will be right back

                 where I found you...

                             JACK

                 I swear on my life, I won't...

                             TYLER

                 You will.  You know you will.

     Jack stares at Tyler, tears welling up, hangs his head.  He

     looks at the gun in his hand...

                             TYLER

                 Can you live with that?

     Jack stares at the gun a long time... then...

     Jack brings the gun up, PUTS THE GUN IN HIS MOUTH.

     Tyler cocks his head.

                             TYLER

                 What are you doing?

                             JACK

                 What have you left for me?

                             TYLER

                 Why do you want to do that? Why do

                 you want to put that gun in your

                 mouth?

                             JACK

                 Not my mouth.  Our mouth.

     Tyler is calm.

                             TYLER

                 This is interesting.

     Tyler smiles in appreciation, slowly walks forward, stands

     very close to Jack.

                             TYLER

                 Why are you going with this, Ikea-

                 boy?

                             JACK

                 It's the only way to get rid of you...

     Jack COCKS the hammer on the gun.

                             TYLER

                 I can see you feel very strongly.  I

                 feel strongly too.

                       (pause)

                 Hey, you and me.

                       (pause)

                 Friends again?

     Their eyes are locked, unblinking.  Long silence.

                             JACK

                 Do something for me.

                             TYLER

                 What?

                             JACK

                 Appreciate something.

                             TYLER

                 What?

                             JACK

                 Look at me...

                             TYLER

                 What?

                             JACK

                 My eyes are open.

     EXTREME SLOW MOTION:

     Jack's finger squeezes the trigger...

     KABLAM! -- Jack's cheeks INFLATE with gas.  His eyes bulge.

     BLOOD flies out from his head.  The WINDOW behind him

     SHATTERS.  SMOKE wafts out of his mouth and tear ducts.

     RESUME NORMAL SPEED as the GLASS FALLS behind Jack...

     Tyler stands, in gunsmoke, eyes glazed, sniffs the air...

                             TYLER

                 What's that smell... ?

     Jack slumps to the floor... Tyler falls...

     Tyler hits the ground.  The back of TYLER'S HEAD is BLOWN

     OPEN, revealing blood, skull and brain.

     Suddenly, a GROUP of SPACE MONKEYS burst into the room,

     moving forward to Jack.  TYLER'S BODY IS GONE.

                             TALL SPACE MONKEY

                 Are you all right, sir... ?!

     Jack quakes, holding the side of his head; a ragged hole

     blown in his CHEEK.  He's bleeding hard, but he's alive.

                             JACK

                 I'm okay...

     Jack looks to the Space Monkeys, trying to get his eyes to

     see.  TWO SPACE MONKEYS enter with Marla.  One holds a gun

     to Marla as she struggles.

                             SHORT SPACE MONKEY

                 Are you sure?  You look terrible,

                 sir!  What's happened?

                             JACK

                 Everything's fine.

                             ANOTHER SPACE MONKEY

                 Sir, you look really awful!  Do you

                 need medical assistance?

     Jack sees Marla, tries to get to his feet, falls...

                             JACK

                 Bring the girl to me.  The rest of

                 you get out.  Now!

     The Monkeys bring Marla, releasing her, saluting.

                             MARLA

                 What happened... ?

                             JACK

                 Don't ask.

     Marla crouches, takes out wadded TISSUES and tries to apply.

     them to Jack's wound.  Space Monkeys are leaving, hesitantly.

                             JACK

                 Get to the rendezvous point.  Move it!

     Jack and Marla are left alone.

                             MARLA

                 My God, you're shot...

                             JACK

                 Yes.

     Jack tries to got up.  Marla helps him.

                             MARLA

                 Who did this to you?

                             JACK

                 I did, I think.  But, I'm okay... I'm

                 fine...

     MASSIVE EXPLOSION... the glass walls rattle...

     Jack and Marla look -- OUT THE WINDOWS: a BUILDING EXPLODES;

     collapsing upon itself.  Then, ANOTHER BUILDING IMPLODES

     into a massive cloud of dust.  Jack and Marla are

     silhouetted against the SKYLINE.  Jack looks to Marla,

     reaches to take her hand.

                             JACK

                 I'm sorry... you met me at a very

                 strange time in my life.

     Marla looks at him.  ANOTHER BUILDING IMPLODES and COLLAPSES

     inward... and ANOTHER BUILDING... and ANOTHER...

     The FILM SLOWS, then ADVANCES ONE FRAME at a TIME -- SHOWING

     SPROCKET HOLES on the SIDES.  EACH FRAME is an IMPLODING

     BUILDING -- then, ONE FRAME IS A PENIS.  Then, the IMPLODING

     BUILDING again.  SPEED UP the frames, LOSE the sprocket

     holes, RESUME NORMAL SPEED...

                                                     FADE TO BLACK:

                                                end
