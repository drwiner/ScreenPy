        FADE IN:

1       EXT. DESERT - DAY

        All we can see, filling the entire frame is a flame-orange

        sky...almost like the sky from the burning of Atlanta in

        "Gone with the Wind".

        SUPERIMPOSE:  Presenter credit.

        PAN DOWN lower and lower until we see the terrain below...

        the desert.  There is no vegetation whatever, just sand and

        odd-shaped rock formations.  The air is filled with red dust,

        which alternately obscures and then reveals the image.

        CAMERA MOVES FORWARD optically - enlarging the film grain in

        the process.

        SLOW DISOLVE

        OPENING CREDITS BEGIN.

        ANOTHER SHOT of a barren landscape, once more with bizarre

        rocks.  Dust.  Sound of wind.  CAMERA MOVES FORWARD again.

        DISSOLVE.

        ANOTHER LANDSCAPE, but this time, in the distance are some

        enormous plastic domes.  Sunlight striking them and reflect-

        ing causes brilliant rainbows.  CAMERA optically tracks

        toward the dome, seen in tantalizingly indistinct fashion

        through the red dust.  DISSOLVE...

        ANOTHER ANGLE, and, in the distance, on the horizon of the

        arid landscape is a huge SPHINX-LIKE STRUCTURE.  (It is

        reminiscent of the Egyptian sphinx, but both body and face,

        though gargoyle-like, are different in design.)  There are

        some large pyramids not far from the sphinx.  CAMERA MOVES

        optically FORWARD.  DISSOLVE.

        CAMERA is much closer to the sphinx and is directly in front.

        It moves (combination of zoom and optical printer move)

        towards the eyes, which appear to be red gems.

        As CAMERA APPROACHES one of the eyes, it appears to be

        stained red glass, as in a temple.  Suddenly there is a

        terrific explosion and the glass shatters into millions of

        fragments which hurtle toward the camera...

2       INT. CATACOMB BELOW "SPHINX" - DAY

        A MAN wearing a LIGHTWEIGHT THERMAL SUIT is RUNNING THROUGH

        THIS LABYRINTH of TUNNELS.  The GROUND TREMBLES under him,

        as if in an earthquake.  We cannot clearly make out his face,

        especially since he wears some kind of BREATHING APPARATUS

        over a portion of it.

        The surface of the tunnel's "walls" is curious;  the walls

        are, again, bright reddish orange, and a composite of two

        different substances:  rough-textured, clay-like material

        and red quartz, which glistens like crystal.

        The man throws a backward glance over his shoulder, fear-

        fully, as he runs.  His HANDS are SPLATTERED with BLOOD.

        Because of this, the RED GLOW, the air of FEAR to the man,

        and the GROUND HEAVING and BUCKLING, there is almost a

        SATANIC suggestion to the scene.

        Suddenly, up AHEAD of the man, there appears a BRILLIANT

        WHITE LIGHT.  He SEES IT, and runs even faster towards it.

        We are ALMOST UP TO THE LIGHT, and we SEE HANDS REACHING

        OUT OF THE LIGHT TOWARDS US... that seem to beckon him to

        SAFETY.

        ABRUPTLY, the ENTIRE SCREEN GOES RED, BUT IN REVERSE NEGATIVE;

        with YELLOW LAYOVERS.  (So that all the images we see --

        ENTIRE FRAME -- are small YELLOW AREAS diffused on a RED

        BACKGROUND.)  It is much like looking at a tableau made out

        of molten lava.

3       INT. BEDROOM IN SMALL APARTMENT - MORNING

        DOUGLAS QUAIL and his wife KRISTEN, are asleep in bed.

        Gradually the room lights BRIGHTEN.  The CLOCK CHIMES and

        begins SPEAKING in a soft, feminine voice.

                                 CLOCK

                           (sweetly)

                   Tick, tock, seven o'clock.  Time

                   to rise and open your eyes.

        They don't budge.  Shortly, the clock CHIMES again.

                                 CLOCK

                           (continuing)

                   Tick, tock, seven-oh-one.  Time

                   to get up, the day had begun.

        Quail's wife stirs.  Maddeningly, the clock CHIMES a third

        time.

                                 CLOCK

                           (continuing)

                   Tick, tock --

        Quail reaches out and shuts the clock off.  Then he sits up

        in bed.

        He swings his legs out from under the covers and sits on the

        edge of the bed.  He puts on his glasses and sits, lost  in

        thought.

        He is a good-looking but conventional man in his early

        thirties.  He seems rather in awe of his wife, who is

        attractive and rather off-hand towards him.

        Kirsten pulls on her robe, lights a cigarette, sits fishing

        for her slippers.

                                 QUAIL

                   I dreamed about Mars again... it

                   was bizarre, yet is was so real...

                                 KIRSTEN

                           (casual)

                   It's your time of the month again.

        Quail looks at her quizzically.

                                 KIRSTEN

                           (continuing;

                            world-weary air)

                   At least once a month.  Douglas

                   Quail's obsession.  For twelve

                   years you've been talking about

                   Mars.

                                 QUAIL

                   People do go to Mars, you know.

                                 KIRSTEN

                   That's right, Douglas.  But not

                   you.  Not us.

        Quail looks crestfallen.

                                 KIRSTEN

                           (continuing;

                            disdainful)

                   As it is, we can barely scrape by

                   on your lousy ten thousand a week.

        She leaves the room.  He meditates on what she said,

        depressed.

4       INT. KITCHENETTE - MORNING

        Quail and Kirsten sit at a small table, eating breakfast.

        On the WALL is projected the front page of a NEWSPAPER.

        Drinking his coffee, Quail studies the wall with the air

        of a man who had his "node stuck in a newspaper," ignoring

        his wife.

        The newspaper headline reads:  "RIOTING ON MARS OVER WATER

        TAX."

        His wife is reading a different article:  "Four Women Rape

        Man in Park."

                                 KIRSTEN

                           (mumbling)

                   What do they expect ... the

                   way men dress these days ...

                   then they scream rape.

        Quail is absorbed in his own paper and doesn't hear her.

                                 QUAIL

                   You know -- let's really do it.

                                 KIRSTEN

                   Rape men in the park?

                                 QUAIL

                   No.  Go to Mars.

                                 KIRSTEN

                           (withering)

                   Go to hell.

                                 QUAIL

                   We can pool our savings and

                   I've got some sick leave

                   coming, besides my regular

                   vacation...

                                 KIRSTEN

                           (interrupting;

                            corrects herself)

                   ...more of a half-wit.  For

                   a start a war could break out

                   there any day ...

        She gestures toward the TV screen where Martian police

        are keeping protesters behind a barrier.  Some have signs

        reading "A FREE MARS", "DOWN WITH COHAAGEN", "EARTH - OUT"

        etc.

                                 QUAIL

                   That's just media talk.  They're...

                           (indicating

                            the protesters)

                   ...just a minority.  They're

                   powerless.

                                 KIRSTEN

                   Well, there's a lot of things

                   we need around here before

                   we waste our money on a trip

                   to Mars.  We're broke.  I'm

                   just a slave around this dump.

                   Now if you were capable of

                   finding a better job....

        The kitchen clock chimes and talks.

                                 CLOCK

                   It's now eight.  You'll be

                   late!

                                 QUAIL

                   I'll be late!

        He jumps up quickly from the table, picks up his coat and

        briefcase, kisses KIRSTEN's perfunctorily offered cheek

        and leaves.

4A      EXT. CITY - EARLY MORNING

        CAMERA TRACKS with Quail as he walks along the busy modern

        street towards a subway station.  Modern cars (out of focus)

        pass noiselessly between the camera and Quail.  There is a

        plaintive tune being played on violin.  Quail pauses and

        gives a wad of notes to the aged violinist, then walks on

        briskly.

5       INT. SUBWAY STATION - EARLY MORNING

        Quail enters the station.  Everybody must pass through a

        weapons check before proceeding to the platforms.

        TWO ARMED GUARDS stand at either side, as commuters pass

        through an electronic beam.  On a screen, the entire body

        of each person is seen in X-ray.  All of them are clearly

        carrying a gun in their inside coat pocket.

                                 GUARD

                   No weapon again, Mr. Quail?

                                 QUAIL

                   I keep forgetting, Herb.  They

                   frighten me.

                                 GUARD

                   Yeah?  Well, it's the law,

                   Mr. Quail.  Has been since

                   1990 they tell me.  Tomorrow -

                   ya carry ya gun or ya get

                   reported.

        GUARD gestures to his associate.  They've obviously been

        through this with Quail before.

                                 QUAIL

                   Okay.  Herb, okay.

        Quail walks on to the track area.  The train arrives.

        Signs above each approaching car say "CAR FULL", "ROOM

        FOR 10 PERSONS", etc.  Quail goes to a carriage marked

        "NEW CAR".

6       INT. URBAN TRANSIT TRAIN - DAY

        The doors open and the crowd surges on.  Quail grabs a

        seat.  At intervals throughout the car are VIDEO MONITORS

        on which a NEWS BROADCAST is showing.

                                 NEWSCASTER (V.O.)

                   -- more violence today from Mars's

                   strike-torn ore colonies --

        Everyone ignores the broadcast -- except Quail, who perks

        instantly at the word "Mars."

        The NEWSCASTER is a young black man.

                                 NEWSCASTER

                           (continuing)

                   ...but Earth Intelligence Operations

                   Director Vilos Cohaagen, clearly

                   worried about the damage to Mars's

                   all important tourist

                   industry was today dismissive

                   of the dissident groups....

        TV scene switches to a press conference.  COHAAGEN, sur-

        rounded by AIDES, steps in front of a podium packed with

        news network microphones and cameras.  Cohaagen is a

        striking, intense man with an obvious air of power.

                                 COHAAGEN

                  We're dealing with a bunch of

                  extremists and unrepresentative

                  lunatics.  Mars is a happy and

                  prosperous protectorate of Earth...

                  and will remain so.

        The train stops at another station and more people pile on.

        Quail tries to watch the broadcast through the bodies

        passing in front of him and intermittently blocking the

        image.

                                 REPORTER (V.O.)

                   There have been some criticisms,

                   sir....

                                 COHAAGEN

                   I have no further comment.

        The news conference ends and a bright looking young man

        comes on the screen.  Quail continues to watch, though

        not as interested, initially, as he was by the Mars story.

        Few of the other passengers bother looking at the screen.

                                 ANNOUNCER

                   Good morning, commuters.  This

                   portion of your trip is brought

                   to you by Rekall, Inc.  Do you

                   have a dream that never came

                   true?  Do you aspire - but

                   only perspire?  Has the great

                   adventure passed you by?  Then

                   come to... REKALL, where what

                   might have been will have been.

                   For the memories of a

                   lifetime... REKALL.

        Quail watches the commercial through to the end, but doesn't

        seem to take it very seriously.  He glances away as a card

        comes on the screen with REKALL's numbers.

6B      INT. QUAIL'S OFFICE - DAY

        Quail is seated at a computer console in a vast beehive

        of a room.  Numerous people are typing information onto

        the screens.  Quail pauses in his typing, thoughtful.  He

        then types in a little more information, then pauses again.

        On the screen, a sentence types itself...

        WHY HAVE YOU STOPPED?  REQUEST MORE INFORMATION.

        Quail read it and continues.

9       INT. McCLANE'S OFFICE - REKALL - DAY

        Scene opens on a CU of McCLANE, a genial, bubbling, enthus-

        iastic man.

                                 McCLANE

                   We're all dreamers, Douglas.

                   But here at Rekall, dreams

                   are our business.

        He presses a button on his desk and the chairs on which

        they are seated appear to be in outer space.  Countless

        stars glitter all around.  Startlingly, a comet whizzes by.

        Quail is amazed.  McClane grins and presses the button

        again.  The scene changes to a beautiful underwater coral

        reef.  Multi-colored fish swim around the chairs and desk.

                                 QUAIL

                   But... is the process really

                   that effective?  A false

                   memory!?

                                 McCLANE

                           (shaking his head;

                            smiling)

                   We prefer the term "extra-

                   factual implant".  Your

                   memory will be complete in

                   every way.  You will have

                   gone to Mars.  We guarantee

                   that.

                                 QUAIL

                   Is it in any way dangerous?

                   I mean, the medical techniques?

                                 McCLANE

                   Not when you deal with

                   qualified operators - like

                   us.

        He presses the button again and the normal office returns.

        Quail looks around, impressed.

                                 QUAIL

                   It's just - incredible.

                                 McCLANE

                   And look at our follow-up

        He puts items on the desk as he talks.

                                 McCLANE

                           (continuing)

                   Space-flight ticket stub...

                   passport... vaccination

                   certificates... matchbooks

                   from Martian Nouvelle Cuisine

                   Restaurants, souvenirs, post

                   cards... even names of people

                   you met - now back there -

                   who you can call and discuss

                   your trip with... by the way,

                   we plant these things where

                   you'll come across them at

                   random in the future.

                                 QUAIL

                   But... I'll know I hired you.

                   That'll destroy the whole

                   illusion.

                                 McCLANE

                           (smiling; self-

                            satisfied)

                   But you won't remember me, or

                   having been here.

                                 QUAIL

                   I won't?

                                 McCLANE

                   Your money back if you do!

                   We've never paid out yet.

        Quail slumps backs in his chair, overwhelmed.

                                 McCLANE

                           (continuing)

                   And we have a special this

                   month, for only two-hundred

                   thousand dollars more.

        At the press of a button, a list appears on the wall...

        A14  MILLIONAIRE PLAYBOY

        A15  SPORTS HERO

        A16  INDUSTRIAL TYCOON

        A17  INTELLIGENCE AGENT

                                 McCLANE

                           (continuing)

                   You can have a new identity

                   for the duration of the trip.

                   Pick one.

        Quail's eyes linger on "Intelligence Agent."

                                 QUAIL

                   "Intelligence Agent"... wouldn't

                   that be dangerous?  I might

                   attack....

                                 McCLANE

                           (airily)

                   No.  No.  You're a retired

                   agent.  Mars was your last

                   mission and you're never to

                   break your cover.  But you'll

                   have got the girl, killed the

                   baddies, and saved the

                   Universe.  Not bad, eh?

                                 QUAIL

                   I don't know... about the

                   whole thing... it's all such

                   a fake.  I won't really have

                   gone.  I won't really....

                                 McCLANE

                           (kind but firm)

                   Let's face it, Douglas, you,

                   and millions of people like

                   you have no chance of ever

                   getting to Mars and you'd

                   never qualify as a secret

                   agent for EIO.  This - REKALL

                   - is the only way to achieve

                   your dream.

        He gets up and walks around to Quail's chair.

                                 McCLANE

                           (continuing)

                   Think about it, Douglas.

                   Think, too, what a terrible

                   boor a real holiday is.

                   Lost tickets, endless arguments,

                   lousy hotels, missed connections,

                   rotten weather... Rekall will

                   supply you with perfect, happy

                   memories.

        Quail is thoughtful, willing to be totally convinced.

9A      INT. QUAIL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

        Quail is sitting, distracted, in an uncomfortable modern

        chair.  Kirsten is watching a near-pornographic film on

        TV.  She casually lights a cigarette.

                                 QUAIL

                   You know that's illegal.

                                KIRSTEN

                   Yeah?  Who's going to report

                   me?  You?... wimp....

        She watches a torrid love scene on the video.

                                 KIRSTEN

                           (continuing)

                   Screwing around's illegal,

                   too.  But just give me half

                   a chance...

        Quail looks at her with distaste.  His expression changes

        to one of resolve.

10      INT. MEMORY STUDIO - DAY

        Quail is stretched out on a plush reclining couch, alongside

        some strange-looking lab equipment, wearing a hospital-type

        smock.  In the b.g. hovers a TECHNICIAN, adjusting some

        instrumentation (discreet banks of computers, etc.) -- that

        apparently relates to the lab equipment next to Quail.  The

        room in a dim, soothing booth, lit by indirect lighting.

        Quail looks a little concerned as he studies all the

        instrumentation next to him -- as one always does at the

        dentist's, looking at the drills.

        The door opens abruptly, in walks a cute-looking LITTLE

        OLD LADY, wearing a JOGGING SUIT.  (A RUTH GORDON-TYPE.)

                                 OLD LADY

                   Hi, I'm Doctor Sophie Lull.

                   Sorry I'm late.

                           (walks toward

                            coat closet)

                   I'll be right with you.

        She dons a white medical smock that covers her jogging

        suit, then slings on heavy, lead-lined protective vest.

                                 QUAIL

                           (looking at

                            instrument

                            console)

                   This really going to work?

                                 LULL

                   It the Pope Martian?

        Lull's assistant, the TECHNICIAN in b.g., who had been

        steadily working on the instrumentation, now looks over

        at Lull.

                                 ERNIE (TECHNICIAN)

                           (at machine)

                   Okay -- that's it.

        Now, Lull extends a long rubber tube, a hypodermic needle

        attached to it.  Quail eyes it warily.  She swabs the back

        of his hand in preparation, notices his apprehension.

                                 LULL

                   Now, just relax, kid.  This

                   ain't gonna hurt.  Just a

                   controlled drip of Narkadine.

                   When you're under, I'll just

                   ask ya a few questions, nothin'

                   real personal, just full

                   details of yer private life

                   so's we can tailor the

                   wish-fulfillment program to

                   your needs.

        She injects the needle into his hand as she speaks, tapes

        it down.

                                 LULL

                           (continuing)

                   See?  Painless.  I didn't feel

                   a thing.  Hey, you're a nice

                   kid... you like a little

                   somethin' extra?

        Quail, embarrassed, starting to go under, nods.

                                 LULL

                           (continuing;

                            pleased)

                   Good!  Kid -- have I got a

                   girl for you!  She's gonna

                   like you.  You're good-lookin'.

                           (beat)

                   Gettin' sleepy?

                           (he nods)

                   Good.  Now, what's the first

                   thing you think of when you're

                   thinkin' about Mars?

                                 QUAIL

                           (wistfully)

                   Well... I'd like to see the

                   Martian Sphinx...

                                 LULL

                   Okay -- you will, Dougle!  I

                   want ya to start counting

                   backwards from a hundred for

                   me.

                                QUAIL

                           (sleepily)

                   One hundred... ninety-nine...

                   ninety-eight... ninety-seven...

                   ninety-six... ninety-five....

        His voice drops off; his eyes close.  Lull studies him,

        adjusts some instruments, then turns to Ernie, glancing

        briefly at a typed sheet in front of her.

                                 LULL

                   Okay, Ernie, the trip to Mars;

                   number sixty-two... and throw

                   in that blonde... We'll give

                   him a real good time.

                                ERNIE

                   Sixty-two... and... the blonde...

        He takes two discs and inserts the first one into a machine.

                                 ERNIE

                   Boy, is this one wild.  He

                   won't want to come back.

        Ernie inserts the second disk.

                                 LULL

                   Dougie?  This Sophie Lull.

                   Can ya hear me?

                                 QUAIL

                   ...Sophie....

                                 LULL

                   Good! ... I'm gonna ask ya

                   a few more questions now.  Ya

                   think you'll be able to

                   answer 'em?

                                 QUAIL

                   ...Yes....

                                 LULL

                   Attaboy!  To begin with, I

                   wanna ask ya; -- You sex

                   life.  How many orgasms a

                   week?

11      INT. McCLANE'S OFFICE - DAY

        McClane has several file drawers open and is removing diverse

        objects and placing them on his desk.

        These items apparently are objects Rekall, Inc. intends

        to "plant" for some client of theirs to find (perhaps

        even Quail) -- as part of his fantasy.

        While he is putting these things on his desk, the PHONE

        BUZZES.  He answers it.

                                 McCLANE

                   Yes?

                                 LULL (V.O.)

                           (filtered;

                            tense)

                   Howie?  Listen, you'd better

                   get in here.

                                 McCLANE

                           (not too

                            concerned)

                   Not another schizoid embolism.

                                 LULL (V.O.)

                           (filtered)

                   You'd better get in here.

12      INT. MEMORY STUDIO - DAY

        McClane come quickly in, brushing the swinging door open.

        Lull and Ernie look up as he enters.  Quail lies on the

        couch, breathing slowly and regularly, his eyes closed.

        McClane looks queryingly at Lull, who motions him to

        silence.

                                 LULL

                           (bends over

                            Quail)

                   Quail?  Dougie, can you hear me?

                                 QUAIL

                   Yes.

                                 LULL

                   Tell McClane what you told us.

        McClane glances sharply at Lull, then turns to Quail.

        Quail's eyes open and scan the room.  They settle on

        McClane.  These eyes have changed:  they have become

        cold and steely.  In fact, Quail's entire personality

        seems to have changed -- his face has acquired a flint-

        edged hardness.  He is chillingly menacing.

                                 QUAIL

                           (a deadly

                            voice)

                   All of you in this room are

                   dead.

                                 McCLANE

                           (not quite

                            taking it

                            seriously)

                   What's he talking about?

                                 QUAIL

                   You've broken my cover.

                                 McCLANE

                   What is this?...

        McClane's eyes flash angrily at Lull.

                                 LULL

                   The Narkadine cracked a memory

                   cap.  Mars --

                           (she's scared)

                   He's really been there.

        There is a chilly silence in the room as McClane digests

        this.

                                 McCLANE

                   Forced suppression?

                                 ERNIE

                   With spontaneous breakthrough.

                                 McCLANE

                   Holy shit.

        They stare at Quail as if he's a ticking bomb.

                                 QUAIL

                           (coldly)

                   You've compromised the Sphinx

                   Project.  You'll have to be

                   silenced.

        Now they're all panicked.

                                 McCLANE

                   Wait a minute.  Quail --

                                 QUAIL

                   My name isn't Quail.

                                 McCLANE

                   Listen... whoever you are...

                   sir....

                           (almost

                            pleading)

                   ...This is all an accident.

                   We'll destroy all the records.

                   No one will know.  I swear it.

                   Believe me.

                                 QUAIL

                   I believe you, but that won't

                   stop E.T.O. from killing you.

        The Rekall people stare at each other in quiet horror.

                                 QUAIL

                           (continuing)

                   Killing you... killing you...

                   killing you....

        His voice trails off, his eyes close.

                                 LULL

                           (intensely)

                   He wants a false memory

                   implanted -- of a trip he

                   really took.

                           (pause)

                   Someone at Earth Intelligence

                   Operations erased his memory.

                   All he know was going to Mars

                   meant something special to

                   him.

                                 ERNIE

                   What do we do?  Graft a false

                   memory pattern over the real

                   memory of the same thing?

                                 LULL

                           (shaking her

                            head)

                  Uh-uh... That could promote

                  a partial breakthrough of

                  the real trip.

                                 McCLANE

                           (overlapping)

                   Revive him without any false

                   memory implantation and get

                   him out of here.

                                 LULL

                   Why don't we just wipe out

                   the memory of his visit

                   here?

                                 McCLANE

                           (nodding;

                            relieved)

                   Yes.  Good.  I'll destroy

                   his file and cancel his fee.

                   I have a feeling that the

                   longer he doesn't know who

                   he is, where he's been,

                   where he's going and who we

                   are, the better off we'll

                   all be.  I'm taking a holiday.

                   A real one.

        He leaves.  The others stare after him, looking very grim.

12A     INT. RECEPTION AREA OF REKALL - DAY

        A dazed and disoriented Douglas Quail comes out of an

        inner door and walks through the lobby towards the exit

        door.

        An attractive RECEPTIONIST, her bare breasts visible

        through a clear plastic blouse, watches him; she then

        looks toward McClane who has half-opened the door to view

        Quail's progress.

12B     INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

        Quail travels down.  Uncomprehendingly, he looks out at

        the city.

12C     INT. BUILDING FOYER - DAY

        Quail stumbles through the fairly crowded foyer, oblivious

        to anything around him.  A red-headed man may or may not be

        watching him.  He makes a phone call from a pocket phone.

12D     INT. ROBOT TAXI CAB - AFTERNOON

        Scene open on Quail, in the back of the cab; he looks

        around, slowly coming to his senses.

                                 QUAIL

                   Where am I?

                                 DRIVER

                   Travelling south along Third

                   Avenue, passing Fourty-third

                   street.

        Although the driver's voice is a little mechanical (flat

        in tone) he is filmed from Quail's POV, and it isn't

        obvious he is anything other than an ordinary cab driver.

                                 QUAIL

                   Where am I going?

                                 DRIVER

                   Thirty-three thirteen "G"

                   Street, Sector "L", Twin

                   Towers, Apartment six-thirty-

                   five.

                                 QUAIL

                   How did I get here?

        Camera now cuts to a shot in front of the driver.  He is

        a fairly human-like robot.

                                 DRIVER

                   I don not understand the

                   question, sir or madam.

                                 QUAIL

                   How did I get into this cab?

                                 DRIVER

                   You stepped into it in the

                   normal manner, sir or madam.

15      INT. CORRIDOR OF QUAIL'S APARTMENT - DAY

        The reception area and hallway leading to the elevators is

        smart and clean, though not lavish.  A uniformed and armed

        DOORMAN is standing by the entrance door.

        Filmed from the elevator end of the area, we see the cab

        pull up and Quail alight and enter the building.  He nods

        to the doorman and approaches the elevators.  As he reaches

        them a MAN steps out from behind the camera.  A 2ND MAN

        enters from a door opposite the elevators.  Quail looks

        at them and becomes quite panicky.

                                 1ST AGENT

                   Aren't you the man from Mars?

        He takes a modern, lethal gun from his pocket.  Quail turns,

        but the other man is behind him.

                                 2ND AGENT

                   Don't give us a reason to

                   kill you.

        Quail looks toward the doorman, who is paying little

        attention to the events.  As the two men edge Quail towards

        the door, he call out...

                                 QUAIL

                   Mr. Zimmer...Mr. Zimmer...

                   help me... they're...

        But the doorman turns calmly away.

16      INT. BASEMENT CAR PARK - DAY

        The two men lead Quail past a number of cars to their own

        vehicle.

                                 QUAIL

                   Where are you taking me?

                                 1ST AGENT

                   You told everyone at Rekall

                   about you trip to Mars.

                   Where you went, who you worked

                   for, what you did --

                                 QUAIL

                   But I didn't... Are you telling

                   me... I did go to Mars?  I

                   don't remember?

                                 1ST AGENT

                   You've remembered too much.

                   The Sphinx Project, for a

                   start....

                                 QUAIL

                           (confused;

                            remembers only

                            fragments)

                   Sphinx?... No, no, I don't,

                   I... What about the people

                   at Rekall?  I don't recall

                   Rekall but you said if they

                   know what I did?  Why don't

                   you ask them?  They'll tell

                   you I didn't...

                                 1ST AGENT

                   They've been taken care of.

                                 QUAIL

                   What do you mean?

        Neither man bothers answering.  They arrive at their car

        and open the door for Quail.  He hesitates.

                                 QUAIL

                           (continuing)

                   What are you going to do with

                   me?

                                 1ST AGENT

                   Get in the car.

        He slaps Quail hard across the face.  Quail is terrified.

        He is tearful with fear.

                                 QUAIL

                   My God!  No!  You're going to

                   kill me!

        He cringes.  His hands across his face.

                                1ST AGENT

                   No one's going to kill you if

                   [you do what you're told.]

                   We're visiting E.I.O. for some

                   new tests.  Now get in, or do

                   we start playing rough?

                                 QUAIL

                   No!  It's not my fault!  You

                   can't do it!

        They start to force him into the car physically.

        Suddenly, Quail stops cringing.  the FEAR DISAPPEARS FROM

        HIS FACE, and is replaced by an odd, thoughtful expression.

                                 QUAIL

                           (continuing)

                   Wait a minute, I remember --

                                1ST AGENT

                   What, Quail?  What do you

                   remember?

                                 QUAIL

                   On Mars... they tried to kill

                   me... And....

        QUAIL TRANSFORMS INTO A HIGHLY SKILLED KILLING MACHINE.

        In an instant, he karate-chops both agents across the

        windpipe, and they crumple to the ground.

        Quail steps back.  He stares at the two bodies, incredulous;

        then stares at his own deadly HANDS.  It is as though they

        belong to someone else.

        Then, leaving the two agents sprawled across the alley, he

        races back into the basement door of his building.

18      INT. QUAIL'S APARTMENT - EVENING

        Kirsten is watching another pornographic video when Quail

        bursts in.  He is still disoriented.

                                 QUAIL

                   Did you know I've been to

                   Mars?

        Kirsten gets up and turns off the movie.

                                 KIRSTEN

                   What!  This stupid obsess...

                                 QUAIL

                           (interrupting)

                   I think I've been.  I vaguely

                   recall...

                                 KIRSTEN

                   Doug, you've got to forget...

                                 QUAIL

                           (interrupting)

                   Forget?  Remembering is the

                   problem I must've been

                   to one of those artificial

                   memory places...

                                 KIRSTEN

                   Oh my God...

                                 QUAIL

                   But something went wrong...

                   something about a real

                   memory... and then those

                   men...  tried to kill me.

                                 KIRSTEN

                   What men?  Doug, you're crazy.

        She starts to mix a drink from a well-stocked cabinet.

                                 KIRSTEN

                           (continuing)

                   You're here now.  They didn't

                   kill you.

                                 QUAIL

                   No.  That's what's so amazing.

                   I killed them.  I think...

        Kirsten stops pouring her drink and look at him sharply.

                                 KIRSTEN

                   Where?  Where are they?

        Quail points down with his finger.

                                 KIRSTEN

                           (continuing)

                   Doug!  It's something they

                   put into your mind at the

                   memory place.  Fantasies.

                   That's their business.

        She sips her drink.

                                 KIRSTEN

                           (continuing)

                   You're a computer operator.

                   You're a bore.  You're a

                   wimp.  You're not a killer.

                                 QUAIL

                   I'm involved somehow with

                   E.I.O.  It's true.  It's no

                   fantasy.

        He walks around the apartment drawing curtains and putting

        out the lights.

                                 KIRSTEN

                   Doug, I want you to see a

                   doctor.  Now Alec and Shirley

                   Turnbull have a good man.  He

                   helped Alec through his

                   breakdown.

                                 QUAIL

                   For fuck's sake, this is no

                   breakdown!

        Kirsten is taken aback at his use of language.  He strides

        into the bathroom and slams the door.  She turns on one

        lamp, goes to a telephone and dials.

19      INT. BATHROOM - TWILIGHT

        Quail takes a washcloth, turns the hot water up full and

        soaks the cloth under the steaming water.  Using it as a

        compress, he presses it against his face and his neck, to

        drain off some of the tension.

        He turns off the water.  Towelling his head dry, he opens

        the bathroom door.

        The instant he does this, a blinding white BURST OF LIGHT

        comes arcing into the bathroom, and the back wall crinkles

        and CHARS into a swatch of blackness.

        QUAIL DIVES OUT THE DOOR, just as ANOTHER BOLT incinerates

        the spot where he was standing.

20      INT. LIVING ROOM - TWILIGHT

        THE ROOM IS IN TOTAL DARKNESS.  The only thing visible is

        the pale rectangle of the balcony window, with the curtains

        drawn over it.

        QUAIL and his ASSAILANT cannot be seen -- but they can be

        HEARD.  There is the sound of a SCUFFLE -- the meaty THUD

        of a FIST CONNECTING WITH FLESH -- and a painful GRUNT as

        someone's breath whooshes out.

        The LIGHT COMES ON.  Quail is standing with one hand on the

        lamp, and the other twisting KIRSTEN's arm up behind her

        back.  A pistol lies on the floor.  Quail is totally stunned.

        He releases her arm, shoving her away from him, at the same

        time scooping up the pistol.

                                 QUAIL

                   My God!  Did you say I need a

                   psychiatrist?

                                 KIRSTEN

                           (coolly)

                   I haven't seen you move that

                   fast since I've known you.

                                 QUAIL

                           (outraged)

                   How could you do it?  After

                   eight years!

                                 KIRSTEN

                   I'm not your wife, Quail.

                                 QUAIL

                   Not my wife!  You are out of

                   your mind.

                                 KIRSTEN

                           (indifferent;

                            nursing her

                            arm)

                   It's a false memory implant.

                   I never saw you before six

                   weeks ago.

        Quail is totally disoriented.

                                 QUAIL

                   Why are you lying like this?

                                 KIRSTEN

                   No, Quail.  It's true.  You

                   work for E.I.O.  So do I.

        As she speaks, she walks to a picture on the wall and from

        behind it pulls out a small wallet.  She flips it open to

        show him her E.I.O. badge.  He looks down uncomprehendingly

        at the holographic lettering "Earth Intelligence Organisation".

                   But why all of this?

                           (shrugging)

                   We had to watchdog you...make

                   sure the erasure took.  A wife

                   seemed like a good idea.

                   All implanted.

                                 KIRSTEN

                   The job's real -- you've had

                   is six weeks -- since you got

                   back from Mars.

        He sits down, holds his hand to his head.

                                 KIRSTEN

                           (continuing)

                   It's all a fabrication, Quail.

                   Everything you know.

                                 QUAIL

                   This is crazy!  If all my

                   memories are false, who am

                   I?  What am I?  Jesus... it's

                   like I don't exist.

                                 KIRSTEN

                   You exist, all right.

                           (very cold)

                   That's the problem.

        A pause as Quail mentally gropes frantically, for what to

        do next.

                                 QUAIL

                   Why did you try to kill me?

                   Why does E.I.O. want me dead?

                                 KIRSTEN

                   They don't particularly.  That

                   was my idea.  This assignment was

                   boring me to death.  The

                   personality they gave you

                   wasn't too thrilling.

                                 QUAIL

                   Well, what did I do on Mars

                   that they have to keep me from

                   telling?

                                 KIRSTEN

                   I've no idea.  I just work

                   here.

                                 QUAIL

                   All right... I'm leaving.

                   Don't try and follow me --

                                 KIRSTEN

                   I don't have to follow you.

                   You can't get away from E.I.O.

                   Nobody does.

        Quail looks at her as if seeing her for the first time.

                                 QUAIL

                   No wonder you got the role as

                   my bitchy wife -- type casting.

        He leaves.  Kirsten smiles secretively.  She goes to a

        drawer, opens it and removes a tiny instrument that looks

        like a TV channel-changer.  There is a very small light

        on the instrument, which begins flashing on and off, as

        the instrument  begins to make BEEPING SOUNDS.

21      EXT. STREET OUTSIDE QUAIL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

        Quail walks briskly out onto the street, controlling his

        paces, trying not to look suspicious.  After a beat, he

        heads for the nearest subway entrance.

22      INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

        Now underground, Quail tries to blend in with the other

        subway people.  He heads toward the weapons check.

23      EXT. STREET SUBWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT

        An OFFICIAL VEHICLE slams to a halt next to the subway

        entrance and a whole load of INTENSE MEN pours out of it.

24      INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

        Quail now shuffles along in a lineup of people waiting

        to get through the WEAPONS CHECK.  He tries to control

        his nervousness.  He passes.  The guard smiles at him,

        pleased to see he has remembered his gun.

25      INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

        All the men with guns drawn come pouring down the subway

        stairs.  The SUBWAY COPS and WEAPONS CHECK are stunned to

        see four large men brandishing guns push their way through

        the weapons check gate without seeming to notice them.  One

        gunman flashes a HOLOGRAPHIC BADGE ENCASED IN PLASTIC at

        them.

        The gunman reach the bottom of the stairs and race closer

        to the subway train, which is just departing.  The men

        halt abruptly.

                                 FIRST GUNMAN

                   Fuck it!

        The second gunman adjusts a small plug - a radio receiver -

        in his ear.

                                 SECOND GUNMAN (EARPLUG WEARER)

                   We won't be able to track him

                   again until he comes up above

                   ground!

26      INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

        Quail sits in the subway car as it barrels through the

        night, not knowing exactly where he will go.  He is

        confused, distraught.  A commercial comes onto the video.

                                 TV AS VOICE OVER

                   Tired?  Exhausted?  Need a

27      EXT. SUBWAY STOP - NIGHT

        Quail emerges from underground and looks around.  The

        streets are almost deserted.

28      INT. MOVING OFFICAL VEHICLE - NIGHT

        THE GUNMEN SIT IN THE OV.  The one with the ear plug

        [suddenly talks.]

                                 EARPLUG WEARER

                   Coming in again.  Loud and

                   clear.

        He looks down at an illuminated street map built into the

        car's dashboard.

28A     EXT. SUBWAY STOP - NIGHT

        A cab comes into view.  Quail quickly hails it and jumps

        in.  Cab moves off.

28B     INT. CAB - NIGHT

        Quail is still pondering what to do next.  He glances out

        one window, though not at anything in particular.  Suddenly,

        the silence is shattered as bullets rip through the window

        on the other side.  Quail ducks to the floor.

28C     EXT. CAB - NIGHT

        A wide shot shows that the cab is being fired on by a man

        leaning from the window of an official patrol vehicle.  He

        is aiming at the tires and driver, rather than directly at

        Quail.

28D     INT. CAB - NIGHT

        Bullets are still pouring in.

                                 ROBOT DRIVER

                           (unemotionally)

                   You are being fired on, sir

                   or madam, please leave the

                   cab at once.

        From the floor, Quail pushes the door handle and rolls

        out onto the street.  The pursuing car occupants fail to

        notice his exit.

28E     EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

        Cars continue, as Quail picks himself up from the gutter

        and moves off down a narrow side street.

28F     INT. CAB - NIGHT

                                 ROBOT DRIVER

                   [Please....]

        Bullets rip into the robot driver's neck, severing the

        head from the body.  The head hits the window then bounces

        back onto the front seat.  It continues talking.

                                 ROBOT DRIVER

                           (continuing)

                   ...leave the cab as bullets

                   are hitting the vehicle in

                   considerable quantities.

28G     EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

        The taxi mounts the footpath and smashes through the display

        window of a store.  Clothes models are scattered and broken.

        When the noise abates, the severed head of the robot driver

        is lying among the dummies.

                                 ROBOT DRIVER

                   This company, sir or madam,

                   will institute legal action

                   for damages...

29      EXT. STREET - "END OF THE LINE" HOTEL - NIGHT

        Quail emerges from the side street and sees "End of the

        Line" Hotel.  It is clean, bland, middle class.  He quickly

        crosses the road and enters.

29A     INT. "END OF THE LINE" HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

        The foyer is brightly lit and empty.  Quail approaches the

        DESK CLERK, who is reading a book.  "Dr. No", marked, in

        flowing script, "from the classic series".

                                 DESK CLERK

                            putting down

                   Here's ten thousand.  Forget

                   the ID.

        DESK CLERK looks up at him, with interest.  His hand

        hovers over the money.

                                 QUAIL

                           (continuing)

                                 DESK CLERK

                   I understand, sir.  Nothing

                   like a bit on the side, eh?

                   Bit of fugitive flesh.  The

                   greatest aphrodisiac is a new

                   body, wouldn't you say, sir?

        Quail looks at him with distaste but is only anxious to

        be given the key to his room.  He says nothing.

30      INT. "END OF THE LINE" HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

        Quail unlocks the door and enters.  No sooner does he

        relock the door then THE PHONE RINGS.  He freezes, stares

        at it for three rings, then picks it up.

30A     INT. BAR BASEMENT - NIGHT

        The man telephoning Quail is calling from a bar.  Occasion-

        ally people pass him on their way to the toilets.  He is

        youngish and conservatively dressed.  He speaks rapidly

        and urgently.

30B1    INT. PATROL CAR - NIGHT

        The earphone wearer and driver are moving in on the signal

        generated by Quail's bug.  Suddenly, the small illuminated

        cross on the dashboard map cuts out.

                   Fifty-eighth.  Tell the man

                   you're Mr. Hotchkiss; you

                   came for your Grecian

                   candlesticks.

                                 QUAIL

                           (infuriated)

                   What do I want with Grecian

                   candlesticks!

30C     INT. BAR BASEMENT - NIGHT

        The man on the phone looks around anxiously.

                                 TELEPHONE VOICE

                   Just do it!  This is no time

                   for small talk.

                                 QUAIL (V.O.)

                           (filtered; not

                            quite convinced)

                   How did you know where to

                   find me?

                                 TELEPHONE VOICE

                   I've been tailing you since you

                   get back from Mars.

                                 QUAIL

                   You're E.I.O.  You're on the

                   I'm E.I.O.  But I was your

                   best friend.  Scott Stevens -

                   we arranged this...

                                 QUAIL

                           (trying to

                            recall)

                   I can't remember - only bits...

                           (filtered;

                            overlapping)

                   I was your fail-safe -- if and

                   when the shooting started.

                   Good luck.  Look me up if you

                   remember me.

30E     INT. BAR BASEMENT - NIGHT

        Scott Stevens hangs up the phone.  He looks around

        cautiously, then walks a few steps to the mens room.

30F     INT. MENS ROOM - NIGHT

        Scott Stevens walks to the row of troughs and begins to

        urinate.  The room is empty.  He hears a noise and looks

        around.  Two EIO men are standing there aiming lethal-looking

        high-velocity weapons at him.  One of them is the red-headed

        man we've already seen.

                                 1ST MAN (RED-HEADED)

                   Well, look at that.  He's

                   really got his hands full.

                                 2ND MAN

                   Not so full, so I've heard.

        Still urinating, the frustrated Scott Stevens can only look

        back over his shoulder.  Laughing, both men open fire,

        riddling him with bullets.  He collapses in an undignified

        heap, his head in the water at the base of the trough.

31      INT. "END OF THE LINE" CORRIDOR - NIGHT

        Quail, with towel around his head, glances up and down the

        corridor -- spots a sign that says "FIRE EXIT".  He races

        towards it.

32      EXT. "END OF THE LINE" FRONT ENTRANCE - NIGHT

        The OV slams up in front of the hotel and a carload of

        MEN tear out of it and barge into the hotel.

32A     INT. "END OF THE LINE" HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

        The startled clerk jumps to his feet as the group of

        armed men enter rapidly.

                                 EARPHONE WEARER

                   Quick.  The guy who checked

                   in fifteen minutes ago.

                                 CLERK

                           (nervous)

                   Room...thirty-six.

        Most of the armed men instantly head off up the stairs,

        their weapons at the ready.  Clerk watches, astonished.

                                 CLERK

                           (continuing)

                   He was only meeting a lady...

                   Aren't you guys overdoing it

                   a bit?

32B     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

        Quail is walking along briskly, still with the towel

        around his head.  A few passers-by look at him curiously.

        He puts his hand together and greets them Indian-style.

33      EXT. PARK AVENUE - NIGHT - CLOSE ON STREET SIGN

        which reads: "PARK AVENUE / 58TH STREET".

        PULL BACK to reveal "The Lucky Stub Pawnshop".  WINOS

        lurk on the corner.  Park Avenue has deteriorated into

        a slum.

        QUAIL ENTERS FRAME, and approaching the pawnshop, stepping

        over a BUM in a doorway.

34      INT. PAWNSHOP - NIGHT

        Quail is just entering; an old-fashioned BELL overhead,

        tripped by the door opening, announces his entrance.

        At once, an immense FAT MAN emerges from the back room.

                                 PAWNBROKER

                   You wanta camera?  I got some

                   good, top-quality ones.  You

                   want silk rugs?  Handmade last

                   century in Iran...all perfect.

                   You want videos?  Old movies...

                   classics...all those Vietnam

                   war ones...real quaint stuff...

                   you want...

                                 QUAIL

                           (interrupting;

                            awkwardly)

                   I'm Hotchkiss...I came for

                   the...Grecian candlesticks...

        The Fat Man studies him warily for a long moment; then

        he disappears through the curtain.

        In a brief moment, he emerges again, carrying a small,

        "makeup-sized" case, as well as two large candelabra.

        The Pawnbroker puts the case on the counter.  Quail looks

        at the case with curiosity.

                                 QUAIL

                           (continuing)

                   I wonder if you could tell

                   me...

        They both look around as someone enters.

                                 PAWNBROKER

                   I trust these will look well

                   in you... mosque.

35      INT. FLOP HOUSE - NIGHT - CLOSE ON HANDS

        Opening up the small case.

        PULL BACK to reveal they are Quail's hands.  The hotel

        room he's now in is obviously a different one than the

        last one we saw him in.  The room is large but run-down,

        the walls are peeling, the architecture is much older,

        etc.

        Quail examines the contents of the case:  there are CREDIT

        CARDS and also MONEY, several stacks of bills, neatly

        tied -- some of it the conventional green, but most of

        it red.

        CLOSE ON RED MONEY

        On the face of it is printed:  "MARS FEDERAL COLONY".

                                 QUAIL

                           (mutters)

                   Martian money....

        Quail thumbs through the money, and whistles softly to

        himself as he sees how much there is.

        Also in the case are:  TWO PASSPORTS;  a small CASSETTE

        RECORDER;  a rolled-up LEATHER POUCH and a spray can of

        some sort;  and a strange thing that looks like a silver

        mask.  He examines the face mask, studies BLACK LETTERS

        WRITTEN ACROSS IT (which we are not close enough to read)

        and then puts it aside.  Another item now catches  his

        eye:  a wristwatch.  He sees a conspicuous red button on

        the side of the watch, and PRESSES IT.  INSTANTLY, TO HIS

        SHOCK, QUAIL SEES A MAN MANIFEST HIMSELF HIMSELF OUT OF

        THIN AIR AND STAND THERE IN THE ROOM A FEW FEET AWAY FROM

        QUAIL:  he's an EXACT HOLOGRAPHIC DUPLICATE of Quail --

        down to the clothes Quail is wearing now.

        The image stands and watches Quail.

                                 QUAIL

                           (continuing)

                   What the hell...?

        Quail smiles, presses the red button again.  There is a

        HUMMING SOUND -- and the man FADES INTO THIN AIR -- like

        a television set being turned off.

        Quail looks bemused.

        Now he unrolls the leather pouch and looks inside.  There

        he finds what look like SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS;  a sponge,

        a long piece of wire doubled over, with some attachments

        and a tiny METAL HEAD on one end, and some tubes of salve.

        He turns on the cassette recorder.

        The VOICE he hears on the cassette TAPE is HIS OWN!

                                 CASSETTE VOICE (V.O.)

                           (Quail's voice)

                   "Hauser, this is Hauser -- or

                   whatever you think your name

                   is now.  If you're listening

                   to this, I'm talking to myself.

                   Your memory's been erased and

                   you've got a wet towel around

                   your head.

                           (he does)

                   "The first thing you've got to

                   do is get rid of that bug in

                   your head."

36      INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT

        The sound of the tape continues as Quail follows

        instructions - pushing the wire up into a bloody portion

        of his neck, just below the ear.

                                 CASSETTE VOICE (V.O.)

                   The monitoring device is

                   located in your left maxillary

                   sinus cavity.  Make a small

                   incision in your neck just

                   below the left ear, and

                   insert the wire up into the

                   sinus.  The head is

                   self-guiding.  Just shove.

        Quail makes a face.

                                 CASSETTE VOICE (V.O.)

                           (continuing)

                   You won't feel a thing.  The

                   spray cartridge contains a

                   local anesthetic and a blood

                   coagulant.  Careful, it's my

                   neck, too.

        Holding the wet towel against his neck, Quail slowly

        withdraws the wire.  On the end of it is a tiny, metal

        bead, the Transmitter.

37      INT. MOVING OFFICIAL VEHICLE - NIGHT

        The man with the ear plug suddenly reacts.

                                 EARPLUG WEARER

                   It's come on again.

                                 DRIVER

                   Where?

        The 1st man quickly check the map-grid in the dashboard.

        A small bright 'x' is flashing.

                                 EARPLUG WEARER

                   He's in that old flophouse.

                   Plaza Hotel.  Central Park

                   South.

37A     INT. HOTEL BEDROOM - NIGHT

        Quail is anxious to get rid of the transmitter.  He looks

        around and notices a rat trap near a rat hole in the

        skirting board.

        He carefully - avoiding springing the trap - removes the

        piece of cheese and pushes the transmitter inside.  He

        then throws the cheese into the rat hole.

38      INT. MOVING OFFICIAL VEHICLE - NIGHT

        The car is moving swiftly through the streets.

                                 EARPLUG WEARER

                   Boy, he's really moving

                   around.

        A CU of the screen shows the small 'x' moving in circles.

38A     EXT. HOTEL SIDE ENTRANCE - NIGHT

        The car pulls up.  Another follows it.  Armed men leap

        out from both.  The EARPLUG WEARER indicates they should

        go down an alley at the side of a service door.  They

        advance cautiously, guns at the ready.  They see no one.

        The EARPLUG WEARER indicates another, even narrower, alley

        leading off to one side.  Two of the men sneak cautiously

        up to it, their guns at the ready.

        A large rat scurries out from behind overfull garbage

        bins.  Furious, they fire.  The bullets rip the bins to

        shreds, scattering refuse everywhere.  The rat is killed.

        They all stare in disbelief.

                                 EARPLUG WEARER

                   Ya dirty rat!

40      INT. E.I.O. HEADQUARTERS - MEMORY LAB - NIGHT

        OPENING CLOSE on a MONITOR SCREEN slated "HAUSER/QUAIL"

        followed by a serial number and some dates.  The slate

        vanishes, replaced by a scene of Quail -- undergoing

        some KIND OF MILITARY TRAINING.

        PAN to OTHER MONITORS, all depicting Quail in other

        action scenes -- on some kind of mission, driving a car,

        etc.

        TECHNICIANS man the monitors, scrolling through them in

        fast-forward and fast reverse as if searching files.

        The technicians turn as Cohaagen and his aides enter.

                                 COHAAGEN

                           (demands)

                   Anything?

                                 SUPERVISOR

                   We're running every one of

                   his memory tapes for the past

                   fifteen years.  Nothing yet,

                   sir.

                                 COHAAGEN

                   There must be something -- some

                   place he would go, some friend

                   he would run to.

        The red-haired E.I.O. man joins them.

                                 RED-HEADED MAN

                           (to Cohaagen;

                            quietly)

                   They lost him.

                                 COHAAGEN

                   Again?!

        The red-headed man nods.

                                 COHAAGEN

                           (continuing)

                   Are you sure the original

                   suppression took?

                                 SUPERVISOR

                   Absolutely, sir.  He thinks

                   he's Quail, a computer...

                                 COHAAGEN

                           (interrupting)

                   Then how do you explain what

                   he's doing?

                                 SUPERVISOR

                   Just his instincts.  He was

                   well trained by E.I.O.... Maybe

                   the memory cap's fractured.

                   Portions of his prior identity

                   could be leaking through.

                                 COHAAGEN

                           (very anxious)

                   He'll remember Mars?  The

                   Sphinx Project?

                                 SUPERVISOR

                   Fragments.  Nothing more.

                   Nothing he could piece together.

                   I did advise terminating him,

                   rather than implanting an

                   identify alternative.

                                 COHAAGEN

                   What do you think I am?  A

                   barbarian?  We're not living

                   in the twentieth century!

        He looks at the video screen again.  An image has flashed

        onto it of an attractive Eurasian girl.

                                 COHAAGEN

                           (continuing)

                   Hold it there.

        He studies the picture, which changes to show the same

        girl from different angles.

42      INT. SPACE PORT - DAY

        Passengers are boarding a COMMERCIAL SPACECRAFT.  In

        addition to the STEWARDESSES checking their tickets, there

        are two PLAINCLOTHES MEN checking every passenger.  They

        carry some kind of small, portable ELECTRONIC DEVICE that

        they shine in the face of each passenger going through.

        (It gives off a BLUE BEAM and HUMS.)

        The passengers are a diverse group - businessmen, officials,

        government people, etc.  There is also a large tour group

        consisting of a predominately middle-aged and determinedly

        jolly crowd, many of them carrying duty-free bags.  They

        are being marshaled by an harassed TOUR ORGANIZER, who is

        carrying aloft a hand-painted sign... "MARTIAN TOUR GROUP".

        The last of the passengers board the spacecraft.  The

        chief PLAINCLOTHES MAN nods to an official and the door

        begins to close.

                                 PLAINCLOTHES MAN #1

                   If he had to travel to Mars

                   with that bunch, I'd be sorry

                   for him.

                                 PLAINCLOTHES MAN #2

                   We couldn't have missed him?

                                 PLAINCLOTHES MAN #1

                   No way.  Let's get a coffee

                   before the next shuttle.

43      INT. SPACELINER - IN FLIGHT

        One of the PASSENGERS -- a middle-aged WOMAN - unbuckles

        her seat belt and heads for the restroom, carrying her

        handbag, and some clothes on a hanger.

44      INT. LAVATORY - IN FLIGHT

        The woman locks the door and turns to the mirror.  She

        opens her bag, takes out a spray container, SPRAYS HER

        FACE with it, and takes out -- the SILVER FACE MASK we

        saw in Quail's emergency kit.

        She holds the mask to her face.  There is a SIZZLING

        NOISE, and SMOKE rises from behind the mask.

        She lowers the mask.  Her face is now that of QUAIL.

        He tears up a passport and drops it down a chute.

        He reaches inside his dress, starts to REMOVE his "FALSIES."

        CLOSE ON MASK

        We can read the BLACK LETTERING written across it now:

        "LASER FACIAL".

45      INT. SPACELINER - IN FLIGHT

        Quail exits from the lavatory and glances toward the

        ebullient tour crowd.  He turns and looks in the other

        direction and sees a video theater advertising "ROCKY 36"

        with Sylvester Stallone III, Jnr.  He isn't too excited,

        but heads towards it.  He pauses a little when an

        announcement comes over the intercom.

        A LITTLE BELL sounds, followed by INTERCOM STATIC.  Quail

        looks up.

                                 CAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.)

                   Ladies and gentlemen, if you'll

                   glance out the starboard

                   viewports, you'll behold an

                   indeed awesome sight --

        Quail goes to a viewport and PEERS, transfixed.  He is

        seeing... at last... the object of his obsession.

46      EXT. SPACELINER - IN ORBIT AROUND MARS

        The SPACELINER -- which we have deliberately not seen before

        this moment for dramatic effect -- banks and turns, suddenly

        bringing into view -- MARS.

        AN IMMENSE ORANGE GLOBE -- so close it looks like it's

        going to fall on us.  It dwarfs the spaceliner.

                                 CAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.)

                   Those long gorges you see,

                   clearly are the legendary

                   canals of Mars....

        The liner drops toward the surface of Mars.  Below:  a

        NETWORK OF INTERSECTING LINES crisscross the planet.

                                 CAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.)

                           (continuing)

                   Of course, they are not manmade

                   canals, but vast natural chasms

                   ...many deeper and larger than

                   the Grand Canyon.  Though

                   utterly without moisture now,

                   scientists have determined

                   that they were formed by

                   massive flooding millions of

                   years ago.

47      INT. SPACELINER

        Quail stares, his brow furrowing as if with some deep

        hidden memory he can't quite recall.

                                 CAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.)

                           (continuing)

                   Surface temperatures at the

                   Martian equator is minus

                   one-hundred and twenty degrees 

                   Centigrade -- in winter.

                   Fortunately, this time of year

                   it's slightly more seasonable:

                   Sixty degrees, Fahrenheit,

                   outside the domes.

                           (beat)

                   Please remember, folks, that

                   outside the domes you'll need

                   to carry your own personal

                   oxygen supply at all times.

                   The atmosphere of Mars is

                   almost a vacuum.  Thank you

                   for flying with Interstellar

                   and we hope your stay will be

                   a pleasant one.

48      EXT. MARS - OUTER SPACE

        CAMERA follows the spaceliner until the ENTIRE FRAME is

        filled with the RED-ORANGE sands of MARS.

49      EXT. MARTIAN DESERT - DAY

        An endless expanse of boulder-studded red sand, under

        a red-orange sky.

        The desert is cut by a ROAD, which snakes across the

        rocky terrain.  Some surface TRAFFIC moves along the

        road (all pressurized vehicles since the atmosphere

        of Mars is almost a pure vacuum) - including the

        MARSPORT BUS.

        PAN WITH THE BUS - TO REVEAL

        A CITY UNDER A DOME.

        In the midst of the stark, trackless landscape -- it's

        midday, scorching -- rises a huge weatherbeaten GEODESIC

        STRUCTURE, its glass surface scarred by sandstorm damage.

        Its feeling is like an old Western, when Clint Eastwood

        rides into Tombstone -- the raw, forbidding vistas, with

        a tough town carved out of the wilderness.

50      INT. MARSPORT - DAY

        Quail is looking out at the desolate landscape.  The TOUR

        ORGANISER, an amiable middle-aged man sits beside him.

        It is possible he is not a married man.

                                 QUAIL

                   It's no Garden of Eden.

                                 TOUR ORGANISER

                   No.  Quite a bit to see, though.

                   The canyons, the old Sphinx...

                                 QUAIL

                   What do you know about that?

                                 TOUR ORANISER

                   Not much, really.  Millions

                   of years old.  Bit like the

                   one that used to be in Egypt,

                   you know...

                                 QUAIL

                   Yeah.  Got destroyed in the

                   Arab wars... What about this

                   independence movement?

                                 TOUR ORGANISER

                           (dismissive)

                   Not worth worrying about.

                   Mostly descendants of the

                   original colonists from Earth.

                   Now they want self-rule so they

                   can sell us all the minerals...

                   I don't think we've met.  You

                   with our group?  Takes me a

                   while to know everyone.

                                 QUAIL

                   Sure.  Douglas Quail.

                                 TOUR ORGANISER

                   Richard Toltz.

                           (they shake hands)

                   Well, Doug, I hope we'll see

                   a lot more of each other.

55      EXT. CITY (UNDER THE DOOM) - DAY

        The bus pulls up outside a modern tourist hotel.  The

        buildings surrounding it have a much more improvised,

        temporary look.  Most are pre-fabricated structures.

        The streets are crowded and there is a "frontier-town"

        atmosphere.  Stalls sell fruit and vegetables, also water

        and air containers.

        A lot of greenery is evident - this is to absorb CO2 and

        emit oxygen, thus helping with the air supply under the

        dome.

        Some small, ragged boys look at QUAIL as he looks around

        before going inside the hotel.  Suddenly, one of them throws

        a small sack at him.  It hits his chest and leaves a yellow

        stain.  The hotel DOORMAN chases the boys away....

                                 BOY

                   Smogpsucker!

        From the other side of the street, a gang of URCHINS with

        a harmonica start singing some kind of defiant PATRIOTIC

        SONG.

                                 DOORMAN

                   You know how it is, sir.  Some

                   of these red-asses are a bit

                   prejudiced.

                                 QUAIL

                   Prejudiced?  Against what?

                                 DOORMAN

                   Earthmen.

        The street song has swelled, adult MINERS and CITIZENS

        joining the belligerent chorus.

                                 QUAIL

                   What are they singing?

                                 DOORMAN

                   The Martian National Anthem.

        Quail tips the doorman, enter the hotel.

57      INT. MARS HILTON LOBBY - DAY

        Quail passes several kiosks -- a magazine stand, currency

        exchange, clothing store, shoeshine stand.  A SHOESHINE

        BOY looks up at Quail.

        Quail walks past, enters the main lobby.  The atrium

        entryway is absolutely fabulous; a complete contrast to the

        dirty, Casbah-like streets.  AFFLUENT-LOOKING PEOPLE in

        spotless linen fill the lobby.

        Quail stops to examine a large ROTATING DISPLAY sitting on

        a table in the middle of the lobby.  It is a stand-up model

        of a SPHINX.  Across the top is written "THE FIRST WONDER

        OF MARS".  A recorded VOICE repeats a canned speech --

                                 CANNED VOICE

                   "...the Martian Sphinx...

                   only evidence of non-human

                   civilization ever discovered

                   ...age estimated at over

                   eighteen million years...

        CLOSE - SHOESHINE BOY

        He stares at Quail.

        BACK TO SCENE

        Quail approaches the Registration Desk.

                                 CLERK

                   Nice to have you back with us,

                   Mr. Hauser.

        Quail is startled to be recognized -- particularly by

        this name.  He tries to stay casual.

                                 QUAIL

                   Nice to be back.

                           (pick up pen)

                   I'm flattered you remember me.

                                 CLERK

                   Part of my job, sir.

                                 QUAIL

                           (starts to sign;

                            hesitates)

                   Do you remember my first name,

                   too?

                                 CLERK

                   Charles.  Charles Hauser, right?

                                 QUAIL

                   I'm impressed.

                           (now he signs)

                   Listen.  I need transportation

                   to the... uh... the Sphinx.

                   Can you arrange it for me?

                                 CLERK

                   I'm sorry, sir.  But Earth

                   government has sealed off the

                   excavation site completely.

                   No one but survey teams and

                   archaeologists are allowed

                   closer than twenty miles.

        The Clerk taps a few keys on a computer.

                                 CLERK

                   Oh...

                           (spots something

                            on the computer)

                   Do you want the item you left

                   with us?

                                 QUAIL

                   What item?  Oh... yes, please.

        The Clerk turns to the safe, retrieves an envelope. He

        hands it -- and an ELECTRONIC ROOM KEY -- to Quail.

58      P.O.V. - THROUGH BINOCULARS - THE SPHINX

        Far in the distance, a dusty red structure squats amid

        barren dunes.  We see vehicles, scaffolding, a fortified

        perimeter.

59      INT. QUAIL'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

        Quail stands at the window, looking through binoculars.

        He lowers them irritably, tosses them on the bed.

        Quail tugs the envelope from his pocket, tears it open.

        Inside is a single slip of paper, on which is written

        in longhand:

                                 "MELINA NOEL

                           Last Chance Air Station

                        Kilometer 61   Gird Square T9"

60      EXT. MARS HILTON - SUNSET

        It is now sunset on Mars and it's literally of inearthly

        beauty.  The sun is bold and blood red;  the foggy, drip-

        ping glass of the Dome tints the light into strange colors.

        Quail emerges from the hotel, properly attired now in a

        white tropical suit, and starts for the taxi stand.

        Behind him, also emerging from the hotel, is the Shoeshine

        Boy.  He keeps out of sight -- but is definitely tailing

        Quail.

        As Quail nears the first solar-powered taxi in line, he is

        approached by an amiable-looking CALYPSO GUY wearing a West

        Indian shirt and bright straw hat.

                                 CALYPSO GUY (BENNIE)

                   Need a cab, boss mon?

        Quail hesitates, unsure of the protocol.

                                 BENNIE

                           (continuing)

                   Mine's right around the corner.

                                 QUAIL

                           (indicating first

                            cab in line)

                   That one's closer.

                                 BENNIE

                   But I out-hustle him, right?

                                 QUAIL

                           (smiling)

                   Right.

        TWO CABBIES exchange curses as Quail, wary, follows the

        Calypso Guy around a corner, climbs into the small solar

        car.

62      EXT. CITY DOME - AIR LOCK - SUNSET

        An AIR LOCK whooshes open underneath a Checker Cab sign.

        Bennie and Quail emerge in the solar-powered car -- set

        off into the desert.

63      EXT. DESERT - SUNSET

        The taxi traverses the same type desert that Quail crossed

        a few hours ago.  Only now is looks completely different.

        The late light tints everything in pastel shades, Quail is

        awed by the grandeur of the Lawrence-of-Arabia-like setting.

68      EXT. DESERT TRUCK STOP - NIGHT

        Quail and Bennie's taxi approaches a brightly-lit oasis in

        the middle of the desert.  There's a cafe, repair facilities

        and a huge parking lot -- all under a garish neon sign:

        "LAST CHANCE AIR STATION AND ASLOON - EAT HERE AND GET GAS".

        Quail and Bennie's taxi pulls in and parks.  In the lot is

        a collection of strange and colorful vehicles:  huge ore

        trucks that pull eight trailers, mountain prospecting jeeps,

        Grapes-of-Wrath jalopies.  Quail and Bennie disembark, wear-

        ing breathing masks, and enter the main building.

69      INT. LAST CHANCE AIR STATION - NIGHT

        The joint is a combination saloon/cathouse/casino.  There

        are slot machines, HOOKERS, MINERS and HOMESTEADERS; it is

        like a Nevada brothel -- packed with wild and woolly indi-

        vidualists, the equivalent of Old West trappers, prospectors

        and cowboys -- but with a space-age look.

        Quail and Bennie elbow their way to the bar.  Fragments of

        conversation are overheard.

                                 MINER #1

                   ...if that intergalactic little

                   Napoleon thinks I'm sellin' and

                   clearin' outta here, he can

                   think again!

                                 MINER #2

                           (with a laugh)

                   ...watcha gonna do when he cuts

                   off the air, Luke?

                                 MINER #3

                   ...you'll be breathin' red dust

                   and shittin' bricks.

        Bennie and Quail pass another group.

                                 MINER #4

                   ...my wife ain't goin' on

                   she hates flyin'...

                   ...yeah, there ain't been a

                   real disaster since that

                   collision off Phobos, nigh on

                   twenty years ago...

                                 MINER #4

                           (alarmed)

                   ...well, that killed twelve

                   thousand...

                                 QUAIL

                   What is this, Bennie...

                   Tombstone?

                                 BENNIE

                   Sorta.  Bunch of miners out

                   here got their own claims, from

                   way back.  Cohaagen's buyin' em

                   all up, says he's gonna cut off

                   the air an' water if they won't

                   sell...

        Quail attracts the attention of the BARTENDER.

                                 QUAIL

                   I'm looking for Melina Noel.

                                 BARTENDER

                   You've found her.

        His nod indicates an area behind Quail.  He turns to see

        an attractive waitress placing drinks on tables.  She

        doesn't notice Quail.  He walks toward her through the

        crowd.  Bennie watches, then tactfully slips away.

        MELINA turns to return to the bar and runs straight into

        Quail.  She stops, obviously astonished to see him.

                                 MELINA

                   You bastard!

        Almost in tears, she pushes her way through the crowd to a

        billiard room, which is separated from the main bar by

        swinging doors.

        There are no occupants and it is almost in darkness.  Quail,

        bewildered, follows her.  Inside the billiard room he turns

        on the lights which illuminates the area of the table.

        (NOTE:  As Quail and Melina speak, the activity in the

                outside bar can be seen above the swinging doors.)

        Melina is still fighting back tears.  Quail stops in front

        of her, unsure about what to do.  He has no recollection

        of how well he might have known this woman.

        Suddenly, she slaps him hard across the face.

                                 MELINA

                           (quietly)

                   You bastard...

        He rubs his painful cheek. 

                                 MELINA

                           (continuing)

                   That's new -- the innocent

                   look.

                           (bitter sarcasm)

                   You didn't have that one

                   before.

                           (beat)

                   Well?

        Quail is speechless.

                                 QUAIL

                   Well, uh... I...

                                 MELINA

                   All right, I'll say it for

                   you.

        He looks relieved (but tries to cover).

                                 MELINA

                           (continuing)

                   Don't worry.  I got the note.

                   You discharged your obligation.

                                 QUAIL

                   What note?

                                 MELINA

                   Oh, the usual one.  "Must

                   return immediately to Earth...

                   the wife needs me..."

                                 QUAIL

                   I don't have a wife.  Well,

                   I do - but not a real wife.

                           (getting

                            desperate)

                   Hell... look... someone else

                   sent that note.  Someone who --

                                 MELINA

                   What are you here for?!

                                 QUAIL

                   For you!  I don't even know

                   why --

        Melina bursts into tears.  Quail rather tentatively puts

        his arms around her.  She welcomes this at first, but then

        pushes him away.

                                 QUAIL

                           (continuing)

                   Whoever I was, I must have

                   been a helluva guy.

                                 MELINA

                   "Whoever you were"???

                                 QUAIL

                   Listen.  I've for to tell  you

                   something.  I beg you to

                   believe me... help me --

        All Melina's suspicions come rushing back.

                                 QUAIL

                           (continuing)

                   Something happened to my mind.

                   Memory suppression, false

                   implant, I don't know

                   what --

        Melina backs off.  Quail grows more desperate.

                                 QUAIL

                           (continuing)

                   What I'm saying is... I don't

                   remember you.  I don't remember

                   us.  I don't remember me --

        Melina's expression grows dead hard.

                                 MELINA

                   [And I thought...]

                                 QUAIL

                   Who is us?

                                 MELINA

                           (ignoring the

                            question)

                   Memory erasure is what they

                   use on agents.  Go away.

                                 QUAIL

                   Wait... I was an agent -- I'm

                   not now -- just tell me who

                   I am!  How did we know each

                   other?  Why are they trying

                   to kill me?!

        He takes a step toward her, nearly frantic.

                                 MELINA

                   I'm not trusting you again.

                                 QUAIL

                   You loved me once, you must

                   have --

                                 MELINA

                   That you was a liar.  Who you

                   are now I don't even know.

                                 QUAIL

                   Please, Melina --

                                 MELINA

                           (tears starting)

                   Get out!

                                 QUAIL

                   I need your help --

                                 MELINA

                           (crying quietly)

                   Get out!  Get the hell away

                   from me!

        Quail gives up; goes through the doors and leaves.  Melina

        slumps her shoulder against the table and cries.

77      INT. LAST CHANCE AIR STATION GARAGE - NIGHT

        Quail enters from the cafe.  Bennie is kneeling beside his

        taxi, repairing a tire.  He look up, sees Quail approach.

        On his right hand, Bennie has a mechanical device

        capable of spinning 360 degrees.  He uses it to twirl

        a lug nut tight on his tire.  As Quail approaches,

        Bennie removes the TOOL ATTACHMENT from his HAND,

        tosses it into a kit beside the taxi.

                                 BENNIE

                   You don't look so good, boss.

                   All over the Universe, women

                   is an awful curse.

        He opens the door for Quail, beams.

80      INT. SOLAR-POWERED CAR - NIGHT - MOVING - DESERT BACKGROUND

        Quail still broods, Bennie tries to cheer him up.

                                 BENNIE

                   It's a tough planet, boss.

                                 QUAIL

                   Yeah, right.

                                 BENNIE

                   Some guy really screwed her -

                   screwed her up real good.

                   Some Earthman.  Just hopped

                   on a space shuttle.

        Bennie bright tone isn't improving Quail's mood.

                                 QUAIL

                   Listen, Bennie.  You're pretty

                   well informed?

                                 BENNIE

                   If that means I know it all,

                   you're right, boss.

                                 QUAIL

                   What do you know about the

                   Sphinx?

                                 BENNIE

                   I don't know nothin'.  Not

                   about the Sphinx.  That's out

                   of the ball park.

                                 QUAIL

                   I have to get there.  Can't

                   you help me?

                                 BENNIE

                   No can do, mon.  You want

                   women, cigarettes, red-market

                   money, booze, even air or

                   water... Bennie's your man.

                   But the Sphinx... that's

                   E.I.O. --

80A     INT. CITY UNDER THE DOME - NIGHT

        The solar car is moving through the crowd, when suddenly

        SIRENS approach on a cross street.  Bennie brakes and stops.

        He and Quail watch as POLICE MOTORCYCLES clear a path for a

        huge, GAS-POWERED LIMO.  MINERS on the sidewalks shout

        CURSES, OBSCENITIES --

                                 BENNIE

                   Well... look at that one, eh?

                                 QUAIL

                   What?

                                 BENNIE

                   Big cheese in town.  Big

                   smelly cheese.

                                 QUAIL

                   Cohaagen?  But isn't he often

                   here?

                                 BENNIE

                   No way.  That cat just cheat

                   the Martian workers without

                   ever leavin' his place in

                   Beverly Hills.  Somethin' must

                   be cookin'.

        Quail keeps his face in shadow and watches Cohaagen with

        curiosity as he passes.  Cohaagen is lit up briefly by a

        street lamp.  His face makes an impression on Quail, who

        perhaps faintly remembers him in the past.

82      INT. QUAIL'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

        Quail enters, turns on the lights, locks the door.  He

        checks all the rooms.  Then he crosses to the dresser,

        studies himself in the mirror.  He looks haggard.

        Quail opens a drawer, takes out his "emergency case," sets

        it on top and opens it.  He removes a shoulder holster and

        pistol, sets them aside.  He takes out a tape recorder.

        He sets the recorder down gingerly, as if somewhere in

        there were contained the answers to all his questions.

        He's just about to activate it, when he hears a KNOCK at

        the door.

        Quail freezes.  Another KNOCK.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)

                           (through door)

                   Mr. Hauser...

                                 QUAIL

                   Who is it?

                                 VOICE (O.S.)

                   Mr. Hauser, I want to talk to

                   you... about Douglas Quail.

        Quail ditches the recorder and the "emergency case" into

        the drawer -- everything except the PISTOL.

        Quail approaches the door very cautiously (from the side --

        out of the line of fire).

                                 QUAIL

                           (tensely)

                   Who are you?

                                 VOICE (O.S.)

                   My name is George Edgemar.

                   I work for Rekall, Incorporated.

                                 QUAIL

                           (stunned;

                            incredulous)

                   Rekall??

                                 VOICE (O.S.)

                   Yes.  It's difficult to

                   explain... Could you open the

                   door, please?  I'm not armed.

        Quail opens it carefully, his gun at the ready, but out

        of view of the person at the door.

        A dignified-looking GENTLEMAN stands there, calm and

        pleasant, wearing an Earth-style business suit.

                                 EDGEMAR

                   Hello, Mr. Quail.  May I come

                   in?  I won't be offended if

                   you prefer to keep the gun

                   you're holding trained on me.

        He can't see the gun, but somehow knows.

                                 QUAIL

                   All right... come in.

        Quail does keep his gun trained on the man.  The man enters,

        holding in his outstretched hand -- a business card.

                                 EDGEMAR

                   My card, Mr. Quail.

        Quail frisks him, then takes the card, glances at it.

                                 QUAIL

                   Okay -- so you're Doctor

                   George Edgemar of 'Rekall,

                   Inc.'  So?

                                 EDGEMAR

                   As I said... this is going to

                   be very difficult -- for both

                   of us.

                                 QUAIL

                   I'm listening.

                                 EDGEMAR

                   Mr. Quail... I'm afraid you're

                   not really standing here at

                   this moment.

                                 QUAIL

                   Sat that again.

                                 EDGEMAR

                   I said, you're not really

                   here.  Neither am I.  We're

                   both in the Memory Studio --

                   in the offices of Rekall, Inc.

                   On Earth.

        Long pause.

                                 QUAIL

                   Are you trying to tell me that

                   this is all part of some...

                   artificially injected fantasy?

                   That I never really left Earth?

                                 EDGEMAR

                   No, not quite.  We didn't give

                   you this.  You're creating it

                   yourself --

                           (pauses, choosing

                            his words)

                   Remember the option we offered

                   you?  Intelligence agent?

                   Something inside you liked

                   that idea, fastened on it.

                   What you're experiencing now

                   is a free-form delusion that

                   you yourself are fabricating.

                                 QUAIL

                   What is this shit you're

                   giving me?

                                 EDGEMAR

                   This is not -- shit, Mr. Quail.

                   It's the truth.

                           (beat)

                   I know it's very hard for you

                   to accept, but you're having

                   a schizophrenic reaction...

                   we can't snap you out of the

                   Narkadine.  You're in a world

                   of your own fantasy.

                                 QUAIL

                   Then how the hell can you be

                   in my dream -- if you know it's

                   just a dream?

                                 EDGEMAR

                   I've been artificially

                   implanted -- like the first

                   part of your fantasy.  I'm

                   actually monitoring your dream

                   at a psychoprobe console.

                   This is a last resort.  When

                   somebody gets stuck in their

                   own fantasy, we send in

                   someone after them.  A

                   specialist, like myself.

                                 QUAIL

                   I don't believe a word you're

                   saying.

                                 EDGEMAR

                   I was afraid you'd think that.

                   I'm sorry to have to do this,

                   but you really are stuck.

                           (calls out)

                   Doctor Noel, would you come in

                   now please?

        The door starts to open.  Quail pivots and points his

        gun at the opening door.

        MELINA walks in, carrying a CLIPBOARD.  She looks at Quail

        with professional detachment.

                                 MELINA

                   Yes, Mr. Quail, I'm afraid

                   it's all true.

        Quail is staggered.

                                 MELINA

                           (continuing)

                   I tried to break through to

                   you earlier, but you just

                   molded me into your fantasy.

                   Sometimes it takes Dr. Edgemar

                   to get through to a client as

                   tough as you.

                                 QUAIL

                           (wavering)

                   So what's supposed to happen

                   now?

                                 EDGEMAR

                   Just do exactly as we tell

                   you.

                                 QUAIL

                           (stares at him

                            coldly)

                   Somehow that doesn't appeal

                   to me.

                                 MELINA

                   Please, Mr. Quail... try to

                   cooperate.  You're having a

                   schizophrenic embolism.

                                 EDGEMAR

                   If we can't get you out now...

                   you may never come out of it.

                   Your wife calls every day --

        CLOSE - QUAIL

        Even more suspicious.

        TWO SHOT - QUAIL AND EDGEMAR

                                 QUAIL

                   If this is a fantasy, there'll

                   be no real consequences when

                   I pull this trigger.

                                 EDGEMAR

                   But there will by consequences

                   inside your mind.  Consequences

                   that won't hurt me... but could

                   be fatal to you.

                           (beat)

                   If you shoot me, you'll wipe

                   me out of your fantasy -- I

                   can't come back again.  Because

                   to you, I'll be dead.  I can't

                   help you get back to reality.

                   You'll be stuck in permanent

                   psychosis.

        CLOSE - QUAIL

        Trembling, holding the gun point blank in Edgemar's face.

        CLOSE - EDGEMAR

        Showing no fear of tension whatever.

                                 EDGEMAR

                   You're going to lower the gun,

                   Mr. Quail.  You're going to

                   hand it to me --

        CLOSE - QUAIL

        Straining desperately to find the true "reality."

        EXTREME CLOSEUP - TRIGGER OF GUN

        Quail's finger on it.

        TWO SHOT - QUAIL AND EDGEMAR

                                 EDGEMAR

                   You're going to do exactly

                   what I tell you --

        Quail PULLS THE TRIGGER!

        REVERSE ANGLE - BACK OF EDGEMAR'S HEAD

        We SEE the results of the gunshot from this angle only,

        and so BRIEFLY as to produce an almost SUBLIMINAL effect:

        the back of Edgemar's head blows off --

        He collapses to the floor.

        Melina LEAPS at Edgemar's falling form and CLAMPS HER HANDS

        over Edgemar's RIGHT HAND!

                                 MELINA

                   Watch out, Charles!  There's

                   more of them in the hall!

        Quail spins toward the door just as it BURSTS OPEN.  A man

        enters, firing, but Quail has fallen to the floor and

        returns the fire.  He staggers back out into the corridor

        and slams against the wall, dead.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)

                           (from hall)

                   You've had it, Hauser!  Throw

                   out your weapon if you want

                   a past!

        Melina is still crouched by Edgemar's body, holding his

        HAND for some reason.  Her CLIPBOARD dangles by her side.

                                 MELINA

                           (whispering)

                   There's an explosive in the

                   clipboard!  He has a dead-man

                   switch in his hand!

        Squeezing Edgemar's hand shut with one of hers, she holds

        up her other wrist -- to show that the CLIPBOARD IS BOUND

        TO HER WRIST BY A CHAIN!

                                 VOICE (O.S.)

                   What do you say, Hauser?  We

                   haven't got all night!  Hauser?

        Quail (Hauser) SHOOTS OFF the chain.

                                 QUAIL

                   What happens it I come out?

        Quail takes the CLIPBOARD from Melina and eases himself to

        the side of the doorway.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)

                   We'll put in a word with the

                   big boys.  Maybe you'll just

                   get exile to Venus.

                                 QUAIL

                   All right.  Here comes the

                   weapon.

        Quail reaches around the corner and SAILS THE CLIPBOARD into

        the hallway.  Melina lets go of Edgemar's hand --

        There is a TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION in the hallway,

83      INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

        Quail comes out in crouch, ready to shoot.  On the floor

        lies a DEAD MAN and the body of the Shoeshine Boy, sprawled

        grotesquely.  The hallway is filled with smoke.  The floor

        covered with debris.  Plaster falling from the ceiling.

        All over the hotel, ALARMS begin BLARING.

84      INT. QUAIL'S ROOM - NIGHT

        Quail strides back in, icy-furious.  He seizes Melina by

        the wrist and drags her after him into the corridor.

84A     INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

        Two more E.I.O. men appear but Quail shoots them while

        dragging Melina down the hall in the opposite direction.

        He pushes open the door leading to the staircase.

84B     INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT

        Quail and Melina run down the stairs.  On the next landing

        is a service elevator, from which a waiter is emerging

        carefully carrying a tray with hors d'oeuvres and champagne.

                                 QUAIL

                   Back in, quick!

                                 WAITER

                   Wouldn't you prefer your order

                   in your room, sir?

                                 QUAIL

                   In!

        Quail bundles the waiter unceremoniously back inside the

        elevator.

84C     INT. LIFT - NIGHT

        Quail presses the basement button.  As he talks to Melina

        he opens the champagne and pours two glasses.  The waiter

        is too frightened to protest.

                                 QUAIL

                   Okay.  Answers!  Now!

                                 MELINA

                   They kidnapped me.  Said

                   they'd kill you if I didn't

                   cooperate.  I told them I

                   didn't care, but then when

                   I realized they meant it...

                                 QUAIL

                   I don't know why they're

                   after me, but what's your

                   connection with all this?

                                 MELINA

                   We were together before.

                                 QUAIL

                   Believe me, I'm really sorry

                   I can't recall the details

                   of that encounter.

        The elevator has reached the basement.  They rush out.

85      EXT. ALLEY BEHIND HILTON - NIGHT

        Quail and Melina run from a basement door into an alley.

        A solar car whips out in front of them.  Quail and Melina

        leap aboard.

                                 MELINA

                   Go, Bennie, for God's sake!

86      INT. BENNIE'S SOLAR CAR - NIGHT

        Bennie weaves as fast as he can in and out of the traffic,

        Quail and Melina ducking out of view in the passenger seat.

                                 BENNIE

                           (glances in

                            mirror)

                   Bad news, boss lady.

                                 MELINA

                   What?

                                 BENNIE

                   Black cruiser just pull out

                   behind us.

86A     EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

        A large gas-powered official-looking car is pushing its way

        through the crowds and traffic behind them.

86B     INT. BENNIE'S CAR - NIGHT

        Quail is aiming his gun at the following car.

                                 BENNIE

                   Forget the shooter, boss.  I

                   lose 'em for you.

                                 QUAIL

                   Lose them?  In this?

                                 BENNIE

                   Hang on!

        Bennie reaches down, grasps a KNOB.  He yanks it, like

        someone starting an outboard motor -- and an ear-splitting

        LOUD ENGINE roars to life.

        Bennie opens the throttle and the solar car HURTLES DOWN

        THE STREET.  Quail and Melina are thrown back in the seat.

87      EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

        GUNFIRE blazes all around the car.  Quail FIRES back at

        the pursuing car.

                                 QUAIL

                           (shouts over

                            GUNFIRE)

                   You're gonna get a ticket

                   for that engine, Bennie --

                                 BENNIE

                   Yutani 650 -- you like it,

                   boss?  Nothing like the old

                   gas when you want a bit of

                   speed.

        BULLETS from the cruiser rip through the car.

                                 MELINA

                   You better have two aces,

                   Bennie.

                           (glances behind)

                   There's a second cruiser --

                   and it's gaining --

87A     EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

        Bennie's car hurtles through the crowds with the official

        car gaining on it.  Bennie takes a corner sharply near a

        huge water selling stand.  The official car brakes to make

        the same turn, but clips the side of the water stand.  The

        water container tips and empties water through the open

        roof (i.e. through which one of the Agents has been firing)

        so that the car completely fills.  The driver continues the

        chase, but the occupants are now submerged.  They frantic-

        ally open the windows while continuing to follow Bennie's

        car.

88      EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

        The solar car rushes down what appears to be a dead-end

        street, with the official vehicle (water pouring out of

        the windows) in pursuit.

        At the end of the street, however, Bennie doesn't stop but

        continues going into a large opening.  It is an abandoned

        mine.  The bigger car follows him, but won't fit.  The

        roof is smashed to pieces as the vehicle is wedged into

        the narrow opening.

        The second official car pulls up behind.  A chauffeur jumps

        out and opens the rear door.  Cohaagen steps out.  He sur-

        veys the scene.  The four men in the wrecked car clamber

        their way backwards out of the wreckage.  They are covered

        in blood and their clothes are in shreds.

                                 COHAAGEN

                   I take it, then, you've failed

                   to get him again.

        Cohaagen turns to an associate, EMILE, a youngish,

        well-dressed executive type.

                                 COHAAGEN

                           (continuing)

                   Proceed with Operation Sphinx.

                                 EMILE

                   But, sir...

                                 COHAAGEN

                   With him...

                           (gestures toward

                            the mine)

                   ...on the lose, I'm not

                   taking any more chances.

                   Operation Sphinx will flush

                   him out.

93      INT. OLD MINE - NIGHT

        The solar car proceeds along the tunnel.  It enters an area

        full of smoke.  Dozens of men are sitting around smoking

        cigarettes, pipes and cigars.  Quail looks at them in

        amazement.

                                 QUAIL

                   What's all this?

                                 BENNIE

                   Nothin', boss.  Just old

                   smokies.  Only place they

                   can come for a puff.  It's

                   all banned topside.

        They have now climbed out of the car.  Quail looks

        searchingly at Melina and Bennie.

                                 QUAIL

                   So you two are into something

                   a bit more serious than the

                   taxi and truck-stop business.

                                 BENNIE

                   That's right, boss.

        He unzips his jacket to reveal a T-shirt with "MARTIAN

        LIBERATION FRONT" (and an appropriate symbol) emblazoned

        on it.

                                 QUAIL

                   My God!... T-shirts.  They

                   died out on Earth years ago.

                                 BENNIE

                           (hurt)

                   Well, maybe we ain't fashion

                   leaders, boss.

                                 MELINA

                   No.  But we still believe in

                   a free Mars.

        They walk as they talk - into a room off the main tunnel.

        It is adorned with "FREE MARS" and "MARTIAN LIBERATION

        FRONT" posters.  A group of people are printing T-shirts

        and leaflets.  They exchange greetings with Melina and

        Bennie.

                                 QUAIL

                   So where did I fit into all

                   this?

                                 MELINA

                   You - when you were Charles

                   Hauser with E.I.O -

                   infiltrated our group.  I

                   guess Cohaagen didn't trust

                   you any more when you and

                   I...

        Her gesture suggests their liaison.

                                 QUAIL

                   Yeah.  And I can't even

                   remember it.  We'll have to

                   arrange a return bout.

                                 MELINA

                   ...so he had your memory

                   wiped and fixed you up with

                   a new identity.

                                 QUAIL

                   But - the Sphinx.  Why is

                   that stuck in my mind?  Why's

                   it so important?

                                 MELINA

                   I don't know.

                                 BENNIE

                   Just an ole heap o' stone,

                   boss.

                                 QUAIL

                   It's more than that, Bennie,

                   I know it's more.  Somehow

                   it's connected.

        He slumps into a chair with frustration.

                                 MELINA

                           (reflecting)

                   Maybe there's a way  you can

                   get your memory back.

                                 QUAIL

                   How?  What?  Where?  When?

                                 MELINA

                   A bit of Martian Wisdom.

                   We're not all stupid

                   colonists.

99      EXT. CITY - NIGHT

        Bennie, Quail and Melina are walking in a crowded area

        of town.  Water sellers and food stalls are everywhere.

        An ARMORED LOUDSPEAKER VEHICLE appears, broadcasting to

        the crowd.  It is also swinging a powerful searchlight

        along the footpaths and streets.

                                 VOICE FROM LOUDSPEAKER

                   ...all residents are to

                   report to their nearest

                   space-travel agent within

                   twelve hours, all residents

                   will be departing on shuttles

                   within twenty-four hours.  Air

                   and water supplies will be cut

                   off at that time.  I repeat...

                                 MELINA

                   He's doing it!

                                 QUAIL

                   What?  Why?

                                 MELINA

                   Clearing everyone out!  It's

                   been rumored for months...

        The searchlight approaches Bennie, Quail and Melina.  Bennie

        ducks into a doorway, while Quail grabs Melina and kisses

        her passionately.  The light sees only the back of his head.

        She responds warmly to his kiss.

                                 QUAIL

                   Wow.  I can see why I was

                   willing to betray E.I.O.

                                 MELINA

                   I though you believed in

                   our cause?

                                 QUAIL

                   Yes.  Of course.  That, too.

        They move into the crowd.  The message on the

        loudspeaker is repeated.

101     INT. KUATO'S SANCTUARY - NIGHT

        The interior of the room is an amazing contrast to its

        ghetto exterior.  The decor is a baroque combination of

        Middle Eastern opulence and 21st century flash.  It looks

        like something out of "The Arabian Nights".

        A man enters from another room.  Although the man's features

        are East Indian, he is very much a Peter Lorre type;  he

        wears a small fez cap and a white linen robe with a cowl

        draped around the back of his neck.

                                 STRANGE MAN

                           (nodding to

                            Quail)

                   Your servant, Fahreem Kuato.

                   I greet you by the

                   twenty-seven names that still

                   remain, praying that you cast

                   jewels into the darkness and

                   given them to glow with the

                   colors of life.

        As Kuato speaks, Quail, unimpressed, talks, sotto voce,

        to Melina.

                                 QUAIL

                   What use is this weirdo?

                                 MELINA

                   Ssssh...there are skills on

                   mars that Earth has forgotten.

                                 KUATO

                   No need to introduce yourself,

                   Mr. Quail.

                           (smiles at Quail's

                            surprise)

                   Tolerate my presumption, but

                   it does not tax my powers to

                   know that you are the most

                   sought-after man on two

                   worlds.

        From the street the sound of loudspeakers giving information

        about Quail and Co. can be heard.  Searchlight beams

        occasionally sweep past the windows.

                                 KUATO

                           (continuing)

                   This way, my dear man.  We

                   have much to accomplish --

                           (ominously)

                   -- and very little time.

102     INT. KUATO'S INNER SANCTUM - NIGHT

        A Bysantine salon filled with enormous Oriental pillows.

        (NOTE:  In the scenes inside Kuato's sanctum, the loudspeaker

                vans in the outside streets can be heard from time to

                to time.  They are repeating the evacuation message

                from scene 99, but alternating it with a call for the

                apprehension of Quail and Melina...

                                 VOICE FROM LOUDSPEAKER

                   ...for information leading to

                   these arrests, first-class

                   travel to Earth will be

                   provided plus a weekend at

                   the Leningrad Disneyworld,

                   all expenses paid.  I repeat,

                   an Oriental girl and Earthman,

                   possibly to be found in the

                   company of a black taxi driver.

                   These are dangerous subversives

                   and sworn enemies of the

                   glorious Peoples Republic of

                   Mars...)

                                 KUATO

                   The turbulence you hear

                   outside is but a reflection

                   of the turmoil within you.

                   You have brought it to Mars

                   in your search for yourself.

        Kuato takes a seat on the pillows, invites the others to

        join him.  Quail hesitates.

                                 QUAIL

                   And you're going to help me

                   by reading my mind?

                                 KUATO

                   Indubitably.  There is only

                   small matter of a fee.

        THREE RESPONSES COME TOGETHER.

                                 QUAIL

                   A fee!

                                 KAUTO

                   Naturally.

                                 MELINA

                   This is for our cause!

                                 KUATO

                           (soothingly)

                   Income before ideals.  Shall

                   we say five-hundred-thousand

                   dollars?

                                 QUAIL

                           (appalled)

                   Five-hundred-thousand Martian

                   dollars, that's...

                           (think,

                            calculating the

                            exchange rate)

                                 KUATO

                   Not Martian dollars, Mr.

                   Quail - Earth dollars.

                                 MELINA

                   That's interplanetary robbery!

                                 QUAIL

                   With today's exchange rate...

                   that's over two million

                   Martian dollars!

                                 KUATO

                           (suave)

                   What price do you put, Mr.

                   Quail, on the future of the

                   solar system?

                                 BENNIE

                   Aw, come off it, man.  Just

                   for a bit of mumbo-jumbo

                   with a crystal ball.

                                 KUATO

                           (his manner

                            slipping)

                   Listen, buster, we're talking

                   heavy stuff here.  You try

                   and work out what's with this

                   guy!

        He jerks his thumb toward Quail.

                                 QUAIL

                   Okay!  Okay!  I'll pay it,

                   but the Interstellar Trade

                   Practices Commission might

                   be interested in this.

        Everyone calms down.

        Kuato smiles.  He extinguishes all the lights save one

        small blue one, which illuminates the room eerily, like

        a seance.

                                 KUATO

                   Retrieving the past is like

                   walking backwards along a

                   perilous road.  The

                   half-recalled, the

                   half-forgotten, the repressed,

                   the fantasies, the triumphs,

                   joys, failures, betrayals...

        He closes his eyes and concentrates.

                                 KUATO

                           (continuing)

                   Yes... I can feel it... a

                   wall.  Erasure techniques are

                   so brutal.

                           (frowns; scans

                            harder)

                   Blocks.  Side channels.

                   Future and past all jumbled.

                   I shall have to enter deep

                   trance to break through.

                           (rising)

                   I will be scanning you through

                   the Oracle Head.

        Kauto turns around and sits down with back toward Quail.

        He reaches up and lowers his cowl, REVEALING:

        A TINY LITTLE HEAD GROWING OUT OF THE BACK OF HIS NECK!

        The head's eyes are closed in sleep.  It is utterly hairless

        and looks like one of those dolls made from dried apples; a

        shriveled, ancient-looking yellow little ball.

        The LITTLE FACE TWITCHED, YAWNS and OPENS ITS EYES, BLINKS.

        It looks at Melina, then at Quail.

        It opens its toothless little mouth and SPEAKS.

                                 ORACLE HEAD

                   Do not fear me.  I need your

                   openness...

        ZOOM IN ON QUAIL'S EYES.

                                 ORACLE HEAD

                           (continuing)

                   Open you thoughts to my

                   presence...

        CONTINUE ZOOM UNTIL ENTIRE FRAME is filled by QUAIL'S EYE.

                                 ORACLE HEAD

                           (continuing)

                   Open...

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

        BLACKNESS BROKEN BY PULSES OF WHITE LIGHT

        The alternations between dark (ACTION) and white (LIGHT)

        are RHYTHMICAL so as to create a hypnotic, dream-like

        feeling.

103     WHITE LIGHT

        Fades to reveal a dramatic CLOSE UP of the SPHINX.  We see

        its face, shoulders and behind it the red Martian sky --

103A    PULL BACK

        to reveal the Sphinx is a PROJECTION on a screen in a

        windowless briefing room.  Quail is seated across from

        Cohaagen and other SENIOR E.I.O. OFFICERS.  On the walls

        are numerous satellite photos, recon maps and excavation

        drawings -- all relating to the Sphinx.

107     EXT. MARTIAN SPHINX - SUNSET

        Scaffolding and excavation works cover a wall of the Sphinx;

        the Sphinx's huge CARVED FACE visible in the background.

        Quail and several other E.I.O. agents stand poised, wearing

        breathing masks and protective gear, as a powerful

        excavation device prizes back a huge stone, revealing

        an ENTRANCE TO SOME KIND OF HIDDEN CHAMBER.

        The other agents are fearful, don't want to proceed.  Quail

        ignores them, enters the chamber --

107A    CLOSE - QUAIL'S FACE

        As he enters.  We read awe, shock and fascination on his

        features.  He approaches something we can't see.  His

        hand reaches out.

        Suddenly, a bolt of incredible powerful energy flashes out,

        striking Quail like a bolt of lightning.

        WHITE LIGHT.

105     INT. LAST CHANCE SALOON - NIGHT

        Quail and Melina are dancing.  The faceted mirror ball on

        the ceiling become the --

        WHITE LIGHT.

106     INT. BEDROOM - DAY

        Melina watches from the bed as Quail dresses.  She rises,

        with only the sheet around her, tries desperately to make

        Quail stay.  Plainly he wants to, but he can't.  They kiss

        lingeringly;  then Quail, as if "called to duty," exits.

        WHITE LIGHT.

108     INT. DETENTION CELL - WINDOWLESS

        Quail alone, hands bound, in a holding chamber.  Suddenly,

        the door opens and THREE BEEFY E.I.O. AGENTS enter.  They

        grab Quail to haul him out.  Quail battles them with

        amazing skill and resourcefulness.  With his bound hands

        he SLUGS ONE MAN, hurling him into a wall;  he RABBIT-

        PUNCHES a second man with a two-handed blow and KNOCKS

        HIM UNCONSCIOUS.  The third man sneaks around behind

        Quail and DROPS HIM WITH A BLACKJACK to the back of the

        head.

        WHITE LIGHT.

109     INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - WINDOWLESS

        Quail on his back, all four limbs pinned by some futuristic

        version of "the rack," his head held imobile by a FEARSOME

        DEVICE similar to the one we glimpsed on Earth, in the van

        the two agents tried to shove him into.

        Several DOCTORS stand over him.  INTO FRAME moves...

        Cohaagen!

        Cohaagen orders the doctors to attach electrodes to PROBES

        already inserted into Quail's brain.  As they turn up the

        power, Quail's face contorts in a grimace of agony --

                                 ORACLE HEAD'S VOICE

                   You have seen your past.

                   Now read the future...

        WHITE LIGHT.

110     INT. SURREAL TUNNEL - DAY OR NIGHT

        The same scene we saw during the film's OPENING SEQUENCE.

        A man wearing a LIGHT-WEIGHT THERMAL SUIT races through a

        LABYRINTH OF TUNNELS.  The GROUND TREMBLES beneath him, as

        if in an earthquake.  EXPLOSIONS rumble deep in the ground

        below him.  Suddenly we realize -- the man is Quail

        INSERT - CLOSE - QUAIL

        He throws a backward glance over his shoulder, fearfully,

        as he runs.  Suddenly a BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT floods in

        from ahead of him;  he puts up his hands to protect his

        eyes -- and sees his hands are SPLATTERED WITH BLOOD!

        Quail runs even faster -- ahead the BRILLIANT LIGHT seems

        to promise safety.  He battles toward it.  SOUNDS OF

        EXPLOSIONS increase, building urgency.  Up ahead, emerging

        from the light, HANDS REACH OUT TO HELP QUAIL.  He seems

        almost to safety.  But just as he REACHES THE HANDS --

        TWO GUNSHOTS RING OUT!

                                                      SHOCK CUT TO:

111     INT. KUATO'S INNER SANCTUM - NIGHT

        Quail awakens with a jolt.  White as a sheet... sweating

        like he's just run ten miles.  Then:  a transformation

        seems to come over him.  He LOOKS -- and SEES:

        KUATO slumped across the cushions -- MELINA beside Kuato --

        BENNIE standing holding a smoking GUN trained on Kuato.

                                 MELINA

                           (rushes to Quail)

                   Charles!  Are you all right?

        Quail stares at her, as if an entire bank of lost memories

        were suddenly clicking back into place --

                                 MELINA

                           (continuing)

                   He kept dragging you deeper

                   and deeper into the trance!

                   We couldn't wake either of

                   you!

                                 BENNIE

                   You stopped breathing!

        Quail gives Bennie that same eerie look, then turns to

        Kuato, who is sprawled motionless across the pillows, a

        curl of smoke rising from two entry wounds in his spine.

                                 QUAIL

                   Why did you kill him?  It

                   was the next bit I really...

                                 BENNIE

                   No choice, boss.  It was him

                   or you.

        Quail lunges across the pillows to Kuato's unbreathing

        form.  Quail shakes the ancient mystic, trying to find a

        last flicker of life.

        Kuato's body is dead white.  Quail releases his grip;

        he about to give up when --

        A MUFFLED CHOCKED SOUND comes from behind Kuato's neck.

        It's the Oracle Head!  Quail instantly rolls Kuato's body

        over.  The Head is still alive!

        Quail bends closer, kneeling.

                                 ORACLE HEAD

                           (whispers)

                   -- the vengence you seek...

                   and the salvation of Mars...

                   are waiting for you in the

                   crown of the Sphinx.

                           (sags, gasping)

        The Oracle Head lets out a LONG SIGH and goes limp, a

        small trickle of blood oozing from the corner of its

        mouth.

                                 BENNIE

                   Phobos and Demos!  What was

                   that all about?

        Quail ignores him, still kneeling -- deep in thought --

        over the Oracle Head.

                                 MELINA

                   Are you okay?... Charles?

                   Doug?  Whoever?

        Quail reaches out and closes the Oracle Head's tiny

        eyelids.  Melina and Bennie exchange a glance.  Then:

        QUAIL

        Stands.  For a moment his back is to Melina and Bennie.

        Then he turns.

        He has become a different man.  His eyes gleam.  He is

        forceful, purposeful, contained.  Once again the ace E.I.O.

        agent.  Melina senses immediately that this is the man she

        knew before

                                 QUAIL

                           (even his voice

                            has changed)

                   I'm fine... only I'm not

                   Doug -- I'm Charles Hauser...

                   and I know everything Hauser

                   knew.

        He turns to Bennie

                                 QUAIL

                           (continuing)

                   Bennie, where's your depot?

                                 BENNIE

                           (working it out)

                   Well... you go outta here...

                   take a left, then down past

                   the first... no second...

                   water bureau you...

                                 QUAIL

                           (briskly)

                   Can you get us there?

                                 BENNIE

                   No problem.

                                 MELINA

                   But why?

                                 QUAIL

                   We're going to the Sphinx.

        He strides off.  The others follow, still full of questions.

                                 BENNIE

                   Impossible, man.  Guards

                   everywhere.

                                 MELINA

                   The Oracle... what did you

                   learn?

                                 QUAIL

                   Only everything.  I've got

                   total recall.

        They are now heading down the stairs toward the street.

114     EXT. STREET - EARLY MORNING

        Quail, Melina and Bennie make their way through the crowds

        to Bennie's depot.  The streets are even busier then before -

        people are now beginning to evacuate the city.  Everyone is

        carrying their possessions - bundles, suitcases, pets, etc.,

        etc.  The loudspeaker vans are still touring and broad-

        casting the same message.

        Bennie indicates a building on their left.

115     INT. CAR POOL - EARLY MORNING

        Bennie and Melina follow Quail as he walks up and down the

        rows of vehicles in the vast building.  There are bull-

        dozers and ore haulers as well as solar taxis.

                                 BENNIE

                   We'll never get near the

                   Sphinx!  They'll blow us

                   apart!

        Quail ignores him as he continues to mumble to himself.

        He rapidly but carefully inspects each vehicle as they

        pass.  Camera tracks rapidly with them.

                                 MELINA

                   What are we doing, Charles?

                   For God's sake, tell us.

                                 QUAIL

                   The Sphinx... it's not some

                   useless artifact, it's a

                   machine built by some alien

                   race eighteen millions years

                   ago.  The same race that

                   built the on one Earth...

                   for the same purpose.

        He stops in front of a large, odd-shaped vehicle with a

        large scoop or propeller on the front.

                                 QUAIL

                           (continuing)

                   This is what we need.

        He begins to climb in;  the others follow.

                                 BENNIE

                           (referring to the

                            Sphinx)

                   It's a hunk of old stone,

                   man.

                                 MELINA

                           (ditto)

                   Purpose?  What purpose?

        Bennie starts the engine.

                                 QUAIL

                   Come on, Bennie, move it.

                           (then, to Melina)

                   Have you heard the word,

                   "terriform"?

        Melina shakes her head.  The vehicle moves off.

115A    EXT. AIR LOCK - MORNING

        GUARDS are carefully checking every vehicle leaving the

        city, though this has to be done fairly rapidly because

        of the inhabitants leaving for the Space Ports.

        The vehicle with Bennie, Quail and Melina arrives.

115B    INT. VEHICLE - AIR LOCK - MORNING

        Bennie is nervous.  Melina and Quail are in the back, but

        cannot be seen.  Guards are checking all vehicles exiting,

        looking for Quail and Melina.

                                 BENNIE

                           (calling to

                            Guards)

                   Just deliverin' some old junk

                   to the mine out at Apidalia

                   Planitia.  Got them people

                   you're lookin' for in the

                   back as well.

        The Guards laugh and signal him on.

        Once through the second door of the air lock (i.e. to the

        area outside the city), Quail and Melina emerge and sit

        up on the rear seats.

                                 QUAIL

                   The machine in the Sphinx is

                   tapped straight down to the

                   molten core of this planet.

                   There are tunnels and ducts

                   everywhere, all powered by

                   fusion generators...

                                 BENNIE

                   You sure the little man

                   didn't fry your brain, Quail?

                                 MELINA

                           (overlapping)

                   For what?  To do what?

                                 QUAIL

                   To combine elements in the

                   Martian core and release

                   them as oxygen, hydrogen

                   and nitrogen.

                                 BENNIE

                   That's air!

116B    EXT. DESERT - MORNING

        In a wide shot, the vehicle is traversing the desert.  The

        domed city is some distance in the background.  Voices are

        heard in false perspective.  Emphasis is on the dry and

        hostile natural landscape of Mars.

                                 QUAIL

                   That's right.  Air and water.

                   Terriforming will create a

                   permanent livable environment

                   for Mars.  No more pressurized

                   cities, no more containers in

                   the desert.  There'll be

                   rivers, vegetation - life -

                   the same as Earth.

                                 MELINA

                           (baffled)

                   So why is Cohaagen shipping

                   everyone out?

                                 QUAIL

                   Don't you see?!  From being

                   a pile of red dirt with

                   minerals, Mars is going to

                   change into  a chunk of

                   priceless real estate.

                                 MELINA

                   And Cohaagen's going to own

                   it all!

                                 QUAIL

                   Right!  He can start selling

                   it off to well-heeled investors

                   from Earth.  Beach condos, ski

                   resorts, you name it.

                                 MELINA

                   No wonder he wanted you to...

                   penetrate... out group.

                                 QUAIL

                           (nods)

                   Once word of this gets out,

                   the whole planet will support

                   you.

117     EXT. DESERT - DAY

        The vehicle is now approaching the Sphinx.  Both it and

        the pyramids can be seen some distance away.

        Voice are heard in CU perspective.

                                 MELINA

                   So what can we do?

                                 QUAIL

                   Ruin his little scheme by

                   terriforming ahead of

                   schedule - while the

                   inhabitants are still here.

        Melina is amazed.

                                 MELINA

                   But who'll work the machine?

                   Do you know how?

                                 QUAIL

                   I'm the only one who does.

                   Why do you think Cohaagen's

                   left me alone all this time?

118     EXT. DESERT - DAY

        The vehicle is even closer to the Sphinx.

                                 QUAIL

                   I was the first one inside

                   when they cracked the riddle

                   of the Sphinx.  It must've

                   been programmed.  Some kind

                   of...force...shot into me.

                                 MELINA

                   But Cohaagen wiped your

                   memory!!!

                                 QUAIL

                           (smoothly)

                   Just a way of putting me on

                   ice.  He'd of reversed it

                   once the planet was evacuated.

                                 BENNIE

                   Man!  This is real complicated.

                   Go over it again, real slow.

119     INT. VEHICLE - DAY

                                 QUAIL

                           (ignoring Bennie's

                            aside)

                   What he hadn't counted on was

                   your effect on me.

                                 MELINA

                           (smiling)

                   And all without the marvels

                   of modern science!

        Quail looks out the back window, his attention attracted

        by two patrol vehicles.  They are some distance away, but

        approaching steadily.

119A    EXT. DESERT - DAY

        A wide shot shows a total of four patrol vehicles approach-

        ing the vehicle with Quail, Melina and Bennie.  Suddenly,

        it stops moving.

120     INT. VEHICLE - DAY

        The vehicle had just stopped.

                                 QUAIL

                   Bennie, don't stop now, take

                   it...

        He turns to see Bennie is covering him and Melina with a

        pistol.

                                 MELINA

                   You bastard.

                                 BENNIE

                   Like I said.  It's a tough

                   planet.  I'm a baddie, not

                   a goodie.

                                 QUAIL

                   I should have known, you

                   were just too helpful.

                                 BENNIE

                   EIO Rule One, man.  Trust

                   Nobody.  Now you can do

                   your terriforming stuff

                   right when those space

                   shuttles are gone.

                                 MELINA

                   But what about the Martian

                   people?  Out cause?  I thought

                   you believed in it.

                                 BENNIE

                   Your cause?  That bunch of

                   dead beat radicals!  When I

                   hand in this little number...

                           (flicks his gun

                            in Quail's face)

                   ...I'll get real estate rights

                   on the whole of Chryse

                   Planitia...

        At that instant, Melina lunges, PUNCHES A RED EMERGENCY

        BUTTON.  The VENT beside Bennie's hand BLOWS OPEN, [causing]

        a powerful suction caused by Mars's vacuum atmosphere.

        Bennie's gun hand is PLANTED AGAINST THE VENT [OPENING.]

        Simultaneously, the air in the vehicle starts rushing out!

        All three parties begin choking.  As Bennie's mechanical

        hand claws for the lever that seals the vent, Quail has

        a moment to jump him.  He pounds Bennie's gun hand, the

        PISTOL IS SUCKED, CLATTERING, OUT THE VENT!

        Quail delivers a roundhouse punch to Bennie, knocking him

        clear across the bus.

        Melina seals the vent, REPRESSURIZES THE CABIN.

        Bennie gets up off the floor, shaking off Quail's punch--

121     EXT. DESERT - DAY

        The E.I.O. vehicle are a half mile off -- and closing in.

122     INT. SAND MOLE - DAY

        Quail glances at the vehicles, turns to Bennie -- ready

        to jump him.  But stops short at what he sees Bennie doing.

        Bennie is clipping on his MECHANICAL ARM.  It sprouts

        several rows of vicious-looking STEEL BLADES --

                                 BENNIE

                   This makes Bennie a cut above

                   anyone else.

        Bennie presses another button and the BLADES START SPINNING.

        Bennie's mechanical arm is in effect now a BUZZ SAW!

        The fight begins.  Bennie attacks Quail with his buzz-saw

        arm;  Quail dodges.  Bennie's arm shreds various articles

        in the cabin -- and keeps Melina at bay with well-timed

        swipes.  Finally Bennie gets in a roundhouse punch to

        Quail's jaw with his real hand.  Quail sprawls, dazed.

        Now Bennie goes for the kill.  But Melina leaps onto him.

        Bennie grabs her by the hair and moves his SPINNING HAND

        in for the quick kill.  Melina clutches the terrifying

        appendage with both hands, desperately keeping it at bay.

        But her strength is no match for Bennie; the whirring

        blades are just about to bite into Melina's neck when --

        Quail comes back, lands a ferocious rabbit punch to

        Bennie's spine.  Quail lunges at him, grabs the blade

        weapon;  he and Bennie crash into the cabin wall and --

        The BLADE RIPS CLEAR THROUGH THE MOLE'S WALL!  Alarms

        sound as a GAPING HOLE IS BLOWN IN THE SIDE OF THE

        CABIN!  ALL THE AIR IS SUCKED OUT BY MARS'S EXTERNAL

        VACUUM!

        Now no one can breathe.  They all claw for their masks,

        [still] in place.  Bennie is first;  he recovers, lunges

        with his SPINNING ARM for Quail.  Quail barely dodges,

        grabs the arm, muscles it back toward Bennie --

        The SPINNING BLADES SEVER BENNIE'S OWN OXYGEN LINE!  Gasp-

        ing, he falters.  Quail aims a titanic blow, PUNCHES

        BENNIE out through the hole in the mole's wall!

        Quail and Melina, masks on, stare out as Bennie claws

        desperately at his severed air line.  The Martian vacuum

        pulls the oxygen from Bennie's lungs, he chokes, staggers --

122AA   EXT. DESERT - DAY

        Bennie is beside the vehicle.  He implodes like a balloon

        with all its air gone.

122AB   INT/EXT. VEHICLE - DAY

        Melina hides her face in horror.  At that instant --

122A    EXT. DESERT - DAY

        Bullets dig into the sand all around the vehicle.  The

        patrol cars are only a few hundred yards away!  Loud-

        speakers call for Quail's surrender.

122B    INT. VEHICLE - DAY

        Quail lunges for the vehicle controls.  Presses a button

        marked "Dive".  The vehicle tilts.

122C    EXT. DESERT - DAY

        The vehicle burrows powerfully into the sand.  As the

        patrol cars close in and rake the desert with gunfire,

        the vehicle vanishes from sight.  In the distance, the

        Sphinx looms ominously.

        A driver in one of the patrol vehicles (filmed from outside

        the windscreen) is speaking into a microphone.  He can't

        be heard but can only be radioing a report.

123     INT. SAND MOLE - MOVING - UNDERGROUND

        The little mining vehicle moves powerfully, propelled by

        its BORER NOSE.

        Quail mans the controls while Melina struggles to shore up

        the gaping hole in the side, into which SAND is POURING

        as the mole moves forward.  Quail looks at a compass in

        the control panel.  He makes a correction.

                                 QUAIL

                           (shouts over

                            engine noise)

                   Hope I've got this direction

                   right.

        Sand pours over him from bullet holes resulting from the

        encounter with patrol cars.

        CU speedometer:  22 MPH.  Every other gauge is overheating,

        flashing WARNING LIGHTS --

124     INT. SPHINX CONTROL ROOM - DAY

        Cohaagen and a number of his associates, plus scientists

        and heavily arms troops are present.

                                 COHAAGEN

                   The air supply is off under

                   the domes?

                                 EMILE

                   Yes, sir.  In a couple of

                   hours it'll be all gone.

                                 COHAAGEN

                   Any trouble with the rabble?

                                 EMILE

                   Not much, sir.  A lot of

                   complaining.  But they're

                   all heading towards the

                   shuttle areas.

        On some of the video screens a number of space shuttles

        can be seen, ready for departure to Earth.

123     INT. TUNNEL BENEATH SPHINX

        The Mole bores through a sand wall, emerges into a cramped

        horizontal tunnel.  Quail and Melina leap out.  The poor

        Mole is smoking like an overheated drill bit.  Its nose

        is worn to a nub.

                                 MELINA

                   We got in with this thing,

                   but we'll never get back out.

                                 QUAIL

                   A shame.  Such a pleasant

                   trip.

        There's a lighted area at the end of the tunnel.  Quail

        and Melina hurry toward it, moving silently, close to

        the wall.

126B    INT. MAIN DOWNSHAFT

        They draw up an abyss -- where their tunnel intersects the

        MAIN DOWNSHAFT.  Melina gasps at the colossal scale of the

        drilling, hundreds of yards across, deeper than the eye

        can see, and crisscrossed by catwalks, buttresses and

        super-sophisticated technology.

        Quail and Melina are forty feet below the upper end of

        the main downshaft.  They can look up the shaft and

        see the first interior level of the Sphinx itself.

                                 QUAIL

                           (points down

                            shaft)

                   This is the main tap --

                   straight down to the core

                   of Mars.  When we trigger

                   the mechanism, fusion

                   reactors will detonate down

                   there -- four hundred miles

                   deep.

                                 MELINA

                   Remind me not to slip.

                                 QUAIL

                   The new elements will come

                   booming up through this

                   shaft -- and six thousand

                   others all around the

                   planet.

        He's right at home -- and full of confidence.

        Quail climbs onto the ladder, which links various top

        levels.

        He starts to climb.  Melina follows him.  They are tiny

        figures.  The space around them plummets down to infinity.

127     INT. CORRIDOR AT TOP OF SHAFT - LOWEST MANNED LEVEL (LEVEL ONE)

        A patrol of NINE HEAVILY-ARMED GUARDS appear from a corridor

        in Level One -- directly above where Quail and Melina are

        climbing.

128     ON THE WALL OF THE SHAFT

        Quail and Melina's heads inch into view at floor level.

        They take one peek at these formidable warriors and duck

        back swiftly out of sight.

129     INT. TOP OF SHAFT - LOWEST MANNED LEVEL (LEVEL ONE)

                                 GUARD LEADER

                           (to two of his

                            men)

                   Stay in contact.  I want to

                   hear from this checkpoint

                   every four minutes.

        Seven of the Guards move off, two remain in position.

        We HEAR the FOOTSTEPS of the seven guards recede.

        The two remaining guards realize their isolation; they

        glance tensely to one another.

                                 GUARD #1

                   Did you hear something?

                                 GUARD #2

                   No.  Where?

                                 GUARD #1 

                   Over there.

        The First Guard points to the edge  of the main shaft --

        right where Quail and Melina are hiding.  The Guards

        cock their weapons, start cautiously forward.  Just as

        they're about to peer over the brink, guns at the

        ready:

                                 QUAIL'S VOICE (O.S.)

                           (from behind the

                            guards)

                   I'm not there, boys.  I'm

                   here.

        The guards spin around, weapons poised.  Standing in the

        shadows, near the corridor, is Quail!  (Still with no

        gun)

        Both guards walk quickly toward Quail, covering him with

        their weapons.

                                 GUARD #1

                           (to Guard #2)

                   Watch him.  He was EIO trained.

                   They're all full of tricks.

                                 GUARD #2

                   Yeah?  Like...who was that

                   guy? -- Fred Bond??

                           (to Quail)

                   Keep 'em up, Fred, keep 'em

                   up.

        Quail has his arms raised high.  Just as the Guards reach

        him, he fizzes electronically, emitting a humming sound,

        then disappears.

                                 GUARD #1

                   A hologram!

        Before either Guard can react, the real Quail appears --

        one foot behind them.  With two LIGHTNING BLOWS, he

        dispatches the Guards.  (Apparently Quail has climbed out

        of the shaft while the Guards were distracted.)

        Quail snatches both Guards' weapons, grenades and ammo

        belts.  Melina climbs out of the shaft.  Quail tosses her

        one of the Guard's guns.

130     INT. CORRIDOR - LEVEL ONE

        ALARMS go off everywhere.  Quail -- carrying a gun and all

        the grenades and ammo belts -- and Melina (just carrying a

        gun) bolt down a corridor past a sign: "LEVEL ONE".

                                 MELINA

                           (running)

                   Where'd you get that little

                   trick?

                                 QUAIL

                           (running)

                   Mail-order company.  It's a

                   great one for fooling the

                   wife.

131     INT. CONTROL ROOM (LEVEL THIRTEEN)

        Cohaagen and his Aides hear the ALARMS, see Quail and

        Melina on MONITORS as they race down the corridor on

        Level One.

                                 COHAAGEN

                   How the hell did they get in?

                                 SECURITY AIDE

                   Up the fusion core.

                                 COHAAGEN

                   Up the fusion core??

        He exhibits begrudging admiration for Quail.

                                 SECURITY AIDE

                           (studies monitor

                            more carefully)

                   They're on Level One.

        A wall sign behind Cohaagen reads:  "LEVEL THIRTEEN".

                                 COHAAGEN

                   Seal all upper levels.

        A button is pressed and huge doors slide across in front

        of the formidable doors already closing the Control Room

        off from the outside corridors.

133     INT. LEVEL ONE CORRIDOR

        Quail and Melina are still racing through the corridors.

        He passes her a fresh ammo belt.

                                 QUAIL

                           (indicates

                            weapons)

                   Know how to use one of these?

        Melina expertly ejects her spent clip (that Guards fired

        at Quail), slams in a fresh clip and cocks the gun.

        Quail has a half-second to react, impressed, then --

        FOUR GUARDS pound into view at the end of the corridor.

        Melina opens fire, nails two.  Quail heaves a grenade; as

        it EXPLODES, he and Melina bolt down a side corridor --

134     INT. VARIOUS CORRIDORS, CATWALKS, STAIRS

        ALARMS continue as Quail and Melina dash down the side

        passageway.  MORE GUARDS cut them off;  Melina's machine

        gun sends them scattering --

        Quail pauses at a corner.  He looks around quickly and sees

        that an elevator is arriving.  He motions Melina back.  The

        doors of the elevator begin to open.  Very quickly, Quail

        bobs his head and arm around the corner.  He calls out,

        loudly...

                                 QUAIL

                   Catch!

        He hurls something toward the armed men in the elevator.

        Instinctively one of them reaches for the thrown object.

        It is an explosive device of some sort.  Quail and Melina

        press themselves against the wall just around a corner from

        the elevator.  There is a tremendous explosion.

        Quail, followed by Melina, rounds a corner.  The elevator

        is in ruins; bodies are scattered everywhere.

                                 MELINA

                   Great stuff, but how do we

                   get up?

        She points toward the upper levels.

135     INT. CONTROL ROOM (LEVEL THIRTEEN)

        Melina and Quail can be seen on the security monitor from

        a high angle.  Quail looks up, spots the monitor, and

        shoots is to pieces.  The image on the screen goes black.

                                 COHAAGEN

                   Forget them.  We'll pick up

                   Quail once the shuttles have

                   left for Earth.

137     INT. CORRIDOR

        Quail spots a large WINDOWED AIR LOCK at the end of the

        corridor.  He and Melina race to it.  Quail starts to open

        the inner door of the air lock.

                                 QUAIL

                   If you're afraid of the

                   heights, you better get

                   over it real quick.

        He is pulling Melina through the inner air lock door just

        as --

        GUARDS stampede around the corner of the corridor toward

        them.

        Quail is out of sight, but they see Melina poised near the

        window.  She waves and smiles to them, hiding her gun behind

        her body.  They slow down and approach less cautiously,

        beguiled by her manner and attractiveness.  As they get

        close, she suddenly lifts her gun and opens fire, mowing

        them down.

140     EXT. SPHINX'S FACE - DAY

        Quail and Melina climb through the outer air lock door.

        They are at the Sphinx's shoulder, with a dizzying drop

        beneath them.  Melina looks down.  She's sorry she did:

        the fall is at least 200 feet.  (Both are wearing their

        breathing apparatus.)

        Quail and Melina start to climb.  Up the Sphinx's shoulder,

        along its Egyptian-like headdress --

141     INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

        Cohaagen's chief aide, Emile, addresses him quietly.

                                 EMILE

                   If Quail's the only one who

                   can operate all this...

                           (gestures toward

                            Sphinx's controls)

                   ...then he can call all the

                   shots.

                                 COHAAGEN

                   We'll tell him the computer's

                   worked out the operational

                   details so we don't really

                   need him.  We're just doing

                   him a favor.

                                 EMILE

                   And if that doesn't work?

                                 COHAAGEN

                   We offer him rewards.

                                 EMILE

                   What if that doesn't work?

                                 COHAAGEN

                   We'll torture him.  You don't

                   think I got this far by being

                   a nice guy?

142     EXT. SPHINX'S FACE - DAY

        Quail and Melina traverse across the cheekbones, haul

        themselves up at the base of the red translucent eyes --

142A    INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

        The video monitors show the space shuttles.  An operator,

        with earphones, turns to Cohaagen.

                                 OPERATOR

                   First of the shuttles ready

                   for departure, sir.  Two

                   minute countdown.

142B    EXT. SPHINX - DAY

        Quail jams THREE GRENADES against the glass of the eyes,

        pulls Melina back behind the stone cheeks --

143     INT. SPHINX CONTROL ROOM

        A MUFFLED EXPLOSION (due to the thin Martian atmosphere)

        detonates overhead.  THE SPHINX'S RIGHT EYE BLOWS IN a

        storm of shards and shrapnell.

        Instantly, the room turns into a hurricane as the Martian

        vacuum sucks out all air!  Everyone panics, grabbing their

                                 COHAAGEN

                   Seal the breach!  Repressurize!

        An aide dives for an EMERGENCY SWITCH.  But now --

        Quail and Melina, wearing breather masks, bursts in onto

        an overhead catwalk.  They OPEN FIRE on the Guards, who are

        choking, struggling with their masks.

        An EMERGENCY PRESSURE SEAL powers into place, sealing the

        breach in the eye.  REPRESSURIZATION comes up, the internal

        atmosphere stabilizes --

        None of the men inside the control room still moves.  The

        victors tug off their masks, spring down to the main level.

        Melina hurries to the main control panel.

        Melina looks towards the video monitors showing half a

        dozen huge space shuttles lined up for departure.

                                 MELINA

                   Those shuttles are starting up

                   any minute.  If you know how

                   to work this thing, you better

                   do it now.

        Quail tentatively approaches the imposingly complex

        machinery.

                                 QUAIL

                   Yes...

        He hesitates.

                                 MELINA

                   Don't you know how?

        Transfixed, mesmerized, Quail moves closer to the control

        panel.

                                 QUAIL

                   Yes... there's a vital

                   connection missing...

        He approaches even closer.  He begins to raise his arm

        towards a blank area a little above his head.

                                 QUAIL

                           (continuing)

                   ...me...

                                 COHAAGEN

                   Wait!

                                 MELINA

                   Don't wait!

                                 COHAAGEN

                   If you activate the mechanism

                   you'll die...there were

                   glimpses of it in your

                   memory.

                                 QUAIL

                   Wrong, Cohaagen, there's a

                   long tunnel, a brilliant

                   white light, hands reaching

                   for me...

                                 COHAAGEN

                           (assured)

                   That's your death.  That's

                   what it looks like.  That's

                   what is always looks like.

        Quail looks around him, half-convinced.

                                 MELINA

                           (looking toward

                            space shuttles

                            on video screens)

                   Charles - for Mars's sake....

        Quail hesitates.  He looks from Melina to Cohaagen.

                                 COHAAGEN

                   It's not too late.  Join us

                   again.  U've a lot to offer.

                   A whole world.

        Quail continues to look at him, thoughtfully.

                                 QUAIL

                   You don't deserve a new world,

                   you and people like you made

                   too big a mess of the old one.

                   Time someone else had a

                   chance.

        He turns back to the machine and slowly raises his arm

        again.  His fingers reach towards the blank section on

        the panel.  Slowly, through the panel, a luminous hand

        reaches toward Quail's fingers.  Gently, the fingers of

        the two hands touch.

        The entire control room begins to rumble and shudder.  As

        Quail reaches for Melina, Cohaagen suddenly dives on him.

        They grapple amid the shuddering Sphinx and can be seen

        only intermittently as debris crashes around them.

        The fight ends as Cohaagen is hurled backwards and

        disappears when a section of floor collapses underneath him.

144     INT. SURREAL TUNNEL

        A reprise of the sequence that opened the movie.

        Quail RUNS THROUGH A LABYRINTH OF TUNNELS.  THE GROUND

        HEAVES BENEATH HIM ... HUGE STONE BLOCKS CRASH DONW ON

        ALL SIDES!  We hear an EXPLOSION and ANOTHER and ANOTHER,

        each one SOUNDING CLOSER than the last --

        Quail clamps him breathing mask on as he runs.  Is this

        his own death?  Where is Melina?

        The tunnel walls are just like the ones in Quail's

        original nightmare -- bright reddish-orange, clay and

        quartz.

        Quail throws a backward glance fearfully over his shoulder.

        The EXPLOSIONS are closer.  Suddenly --

        Up ahead appears a BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT.  Quail sees it,

        but it only terrifies him more.  Is it death he's running

        to?  He hurries on with all his strength, but --

        Just as he nears the white light, HE FALLS.  On his knees,

        too weak to move.  He struggles --

        HANDS ARE REACHING OUT TO HIM, from out of the brilliant

        light.  Quail stretches for them, just as --

        A FINAL EXPLOSION blows him forward -- straight into the

        WHITE LIGHT!  The HANDS SEIZE HIM, pull him upward to --

145     EXT. MARTIAN DESERT - DAY

        The hands belong to breather-masked MINERS, dismounting

        rapidly from an overloaded transport vehicle which was

        taking them to the Space Port.  Quail looks from them to

        Melina, who is walking towards the group.

        QUAIL'S P.O.V. - MINERS' MASKED FACES

        The miners' desert garb, shield goggles and breathers add

        to the surreal nightmare quality of Quail's tortured

        perspective --

        BACK TO QUAIL

        In terror, lost, disoriented totally.

                                 QUAIL

                   Am I dying?

                                 MASKED MINER

                   I won't lie to you, pal.

                   You are.

                                 MINER (from Melina's bar)

                   I'd say in about forty years...

                           (he and others

                            help Quail to

                            his feet)

                   ...come on, we've gotta get

                   to the Space Port.  That

                   Intergalactic Napoleon's

                   switched off the air.

                                 2ND MINER

                   Shippin' us all out.  Mars

                   is finished.

        A MINER'S WIFE watches them.  She is crying.

        Quail looks up at the sky.  Melina follows his glance.

        So do the others.

        Slowly, but perceptibly, the color is changing from yellow

        to blue.

                                 MELINA

                   It's happening.

                                 MINER

                   What is it?

        All the miners are puzzled, apprehensive.  Quail reaches

        toward the one who spoke to him before and pulls off his

        breathing apparatus.  At first the man is shocked, then

        realizes he can breathe without it.  Quail takes off

        his own, then Melina's

        All the miners watch in amazement.  They all remove their

        breathing masks.

                                 QUAIL

                   That's just the start.  Next

                   there'll be rain and growth

                   and ... life.

        Melina embraces him.

                                 QUAIL

                           (continuing)

                   Rekall could never have come

                   up with anything like this.

        Melina looks oddly at him, smiling, mysterious.

        As the sky becomes more and more blue, more of the Miners

        descend from the bus.  Softly at first, then with more and

        more confidence, they begin singing the Martian National

        Anthem.

        The music swells.  Quail puts his arm around Melina.  They

        both join in the chorus.

        It reaches an impassioned crescendo as the FRAME FREEZES

        and the END CREDITS ROLL UP the screen.

                             THE END
