     EXT.  STREET IN GEORGETOWN -- MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

     Fog hangs above the street, amongst the streetlamps.  Apartment

     buildings line the curb, it is very quiet.  In one building, six floors

     up, a bedroom light is on.  WE SEE the silhouette of Norman's WIFE

     looking out the window.

                         WIFE (O.S.)

               What kind of a crash was it?

                         NORMAN (O.S.)

               You seen my suitcase?

                         WIFE (O.S.)

               There's nothing on the news about a

               crash.  Did he say what airline?

                         NORMAN (O.S.)

               He didn't say much at all.  Honey --

                         WIFE (O.S.)

               In the closet.  I don't understand,

               Norman -- why would they call you?

                         NORMAN (O.S.)

               Don't be so supportive, honey.

                         WIFE (O.S.)

               Well, I can't imagine five years of

               unemployment --

                         NORMAN (O.S.)

               Four.  Four years --

                         WIFE (O.S.)

               Four years of unemployment would

               look too good on a resume.

                         NORMAN (O.S.)

               Keep watching the news.  Are you

               watching the news?

                         WIFE (O.S.)

               How are you getting to the airport?

               You need money for the bus?

     A tinted-window black SEDAN travels down the street, pulls up in front

     of the apartment building.  A U.S.  NAVY decal is on the door.

                         WIFE (O.S.)

               There's a U.S.  Navy car outside,

               Norman.

                         NORMAN (O.S.)

               What?

                         WIFE (O.S.)

               Was it a military crash?

                         NORMAN (O.S.)

               I don't know.

                         WIFE (O.S.)

               They never used to send a Navy car.

                                                            CUT TO:

     THE LOUD, HARD CHOPPING OF A HELICOPTER PROPELLER

     EXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN -- DAY

     Blinding sunlight, as the helicopter WHIPS by, speeding above the

     Pacific Ocean.

     INT.  HELICOPTER -- DAY

     Norman, 53, disheveled, unshaven, sits in the back.  He studies a

     pamphlet in his hand: "AIRCRASH SURVIVAL: HOW TO COPE".  The PILOT, in

     the cockpit, turns to him.

                         PILOT

               What kinda work you in, Dr. Johnson?

     Norman quickly stuffs the pamphlet into his dufflebag.

                         NORMAN

               I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am

               really, just been a while.

                    (beat)

               I treat aircrash survivors.

                         PILOT

               Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.

                         NORMAN

               You've heard of me?

                         PILOT

               Well, everybody's been talking about

               that report you wrote.

                         NORMAN

               What report?

                         PILOT

               Huh?

                         NORMAN

               What report?

                         PILOT

               You mean you don't know?

                         NORMAN

               Know what?

     The pilot glances back at him again.

                         PILOT

               Must be another Johnson then.  Been

               flying so many scientists out here

               -- can't keep everyone straight.

                         NORMAN

               Who's everyone?

                         PILOT

               Physicists, mathematicians,

               geologists, you name it.

                         NORMAN

               Geologists?  At a plane crash?

                         PILOT

               Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of

               the ocean no less.

                         NORMAN

               What the hell would a geologist be

               doing at a plane crash?

     Norman looks out the window and sees a group of ships circling in the

     water.

     EXT.  SHIP DECK -- DAY

     The helicopter descends down onto the helipad, wind gusting about.  A

     young, female OFFICER -- holding her hat to her head -- rushes to

     greet Norman, as he climbs out of the helicopter.

     She looks down crudely at his shotty, nylon dufflebag.

                         OFFICER

               Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?

                         NORMAN

               Just that.  Careful, it's heavy.

     She lugs it over her shoulder, no problem.

                         OFFICER

               No other equipment?  Scientific

               instruments?

                         NORMAN

               No, they didn't say --

                         OFFICER

               This way, sir.

     Norman follows the officer away from the helipad.

     INT.  SHIP

     She leads Norman down a flight of stairs.

                         OFFICER

               Captain Barnes wants to see you

               right away, sir.

                         NORMAN

               Captain who?

                         OFFICER

               Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you.

               Been calling us every half hour to

               see if you're arrived.

                         NORMAN

               Really?

     As they march down a hallway, Norman looks down at his wrinkled suit,

     tries to smooth it out.

                         OFFICER

               By the way sir, I've read your

               report.  I think it's brilliant.

                         NORMAN

               What report?

                         OFFICER

               You mean they haven't told you yet?

                         NORMAN

               Told me what?

     She staightens up, like she might have said too much.

                         OFFICER

               This way, sir.

     INT.  BARNES' OFFICE

     CAPTAIN HAROLD BARNES, 60s, immaculate, proud of who he is, talks on

     the phone.

                         BARNES

               How's he look?...  Well, we can't all

               be officers, can we?

                    (laughs)

               They tell me he's brilliant.

     EXT.  BARNES' OFFICE

     Norman stands in front of the door.  The doorplate reads: PROJECT

     COMMANDER -- CAPTAIN HAROLD BARNES.  Norman straightens his big-knotted

     tie.  Deep breath.

     INT.  BARNES' OFFICE

     As the door opens, Barnes is putting down the phone, rises from his

     desk, as Norman steps inside.

                         BARNES

               Dr. Norman Johnson.  Welcome aboard.

     They shake hands.

                         NORMAN

               Thank you, Colonel.

                         BARNES

               Captain.

                         NORMAN

               Captain.  Right, forgive me.

     Barnes looks at Norman, sizing him up.  An akward silence.

                         NORMAN

               Well, thanks for the opportuninty

               here -- my wife appreciates it.

                         BARNES

               Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You

               weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made

               me take you.

                         NORMAN

                    (smiling)

               The Pentagon?  I didn't know I had

               friends in Washington.

     Norman tries to laugh as Barnes ushers him to the door...

                         BARNES

               Come with me.  The team's already

               waiting.

                         NORMAN

               What team?

     INT.  HALLWAY

     Barnes leads Norman down the corridor, lined with OFFICERS and GUARDS.

                         BARNES

               What have you been told so far?

                         NORMAN

               The usual.  Plane crash.  Survivers

               unknown.  Routine stuff really.

                         BARNES

               Anything else?

                         NORMAN

               Nothing else.

     A GUARD unlocks a large, steel door.

                         GUARD

               Captain Barnes.  Dr. Johnson.

                         NORMAN

               Hello.

     Norman looks at the guard as they proceed through the doorway,

     wondering how the guard knows his name.

                         BARNES

               You talk to any reporters?  Any

               press?

                         NORMAN

               Press?  No, I haven't.

     The steel door shuts loudly behind them.

                         BARNES

               Good.  Security's been our biggest

               worry.  Now that you're here we can

               shut this thing down tight.

                         NORMAN

               From what?  What's with all the

               security?

                         BARNES

               Well, we don't have all the facts

               yet.

     Another GUARD opens up another large steel door...

     INT.  TECH ROOM

     Barnes leads Norman through the room, crammed with video monitors,

     screens, and grids.  Officers talk into radios.  Technicians work on

     computers.

                         BARNES

               We're moving fast considering the

               storm.

                         NORMAN

               Storm?  What storm?

                         BARNES

               A cyclone's on it's way in.  I

               thought they would have told you on

               the phone.

                         NORMAN

               They didn't tell me anything.

     Norman tries to keep pace...

                         BARNES

               We've had divers working around the

               clock.  Take a look at this...

     ANGLE ON a large VIDEO SCREEN -- shows a diver walking on the ocean

     floor, holding a bright artificial flashlight.

                         NORMAN

               How deep is he?

                         BARNES

               A thousand feet.

                         NORMAN

               A thousand?  An airplane crashes into

               a thousand feet of water -- I don't

               want to sound pessimistic here, but

               I assume there are no survivors.

                         BARNES

               Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.

                         NORMAN

               Then why am I here?

                         BARNES

               What?

                         NORMAN

               What do you need me for?

     ON THE VIDEO SCREEN -- the diver shines his light on a large, metallic

     OBJECT.

                         BARNES

               What crashed wasn't an airplane, Dr.

               Johnson.  It's a bit larger than

               that.

     Barnes walks toward a TECHNICIAN, sitting at a keyboard.

                         BARNES

                    (to technician)

               Bring up the grid, would you?

     ANGLE ON THE MONITOR as an IMAGE OF THE CRAFT begins to form.

                         NORMAN

               What is it?  A military spacecraft?

               Like a shuttle or satellite?

                         BARNES

               Something like that.

                    (beat)

               That doesn't surprise you?

                         NORMAN

               Not really, no.  Something of the

               military crashes in the ocean -- it

               explains why there was nothing on

               the news, why you've kept everything

               a secret...  When did it crash?

                         BARNES

               As best we can estimate, it crashed

               four hundred years ago.

     A beat.

                         NORMAN

               Four hundred?  You're kidding, right?

     ANGLE ON THE MONITOR -- showing a grid depicting an image of the craft

     and a small layer of ROCK above it.

                         BARNES

               See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured

               the coral growth on top of the craft

               to be over five meters thick.

                         NORMAN

               Geologists?

                         BARNES

               Coral grows at a rate of two and a

               half centimeters a year --

                         NORMAN

               -- Wait a second --

                         BARNES

               -- dating the crash at least that

               old.

                         NORMAN

               Hold on --

                         BARNES

               Maybe older --

                         NORMAN

               -- there's got to be some mistake

               here -- a four hundred year old

               military spacecraft?  There's no such

               thing... our space program isn't even

               forty years old.

                         BARNES

               Extraordinary, isn't it?

                         NORMAN

               It's impossible.

                         BARNES

               I'm afraid it is Dr. Johnson...

               because it's sitting on the bottom

               of our ocean floor.

     INT.  STAIRWELL

     Barnes and Norman shuffle down the stairs.

                         BARNES

               Off the record, I don't mind telling

               you, this thing scares the shit out

               of me.

                         NORMAN

               It doesn't make any sense.

                         BARNES

               We think it might.  That's why we

               brought you here.  We've assembled

               your team -- they're waiting for us

               now.

                         NORMAN

               What team?

                         BARNES

               The one you recommended.  In the ULF

               report you wrote for the Bush

                         NORMAN

               ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that

               in years.  You mean someone actually

               read it?

     As they head down a hallway, Barnes pulls the ULF REPORT out from

     under his arm, hands it to Norman.

     Norman looks at it, almost embarrassed to be holding it.

                         BARNES

               Your report's become our bible down

               here, Dr. Johnson.  We've been

               carrying out each of your

               recommendations -- one by one -- to

               the smallest detail.

                         NORMAN

               But sir, I don't understand.  This

               report -- these recommendations...

               they're for an encounter with extra-

               terrestrial life.

     INT.  BRIEFING ROOM

     ON A VIDEO SCREEN -- sonar video of the spacecraft.

                         BETH (O.S.)

               How big is this spacecraft?

                         BARNES (O.S.)

               Of what we're able to measure,

               roughly twenty-six hundred feet.

                         TED (O.S.)

               A half a mile long?

                         BARNES

               The wing dimension alone is larger

               that any aircraft we've seen.

     The team members sit around the conference table:

     TED FIELDING, 41, geologist, boyish and happy to be here.  BETH

     HALPERIN, 36, biochemist, mother of three who's never worn an apron.

     ARTHUR LEVINE, 54, marine biologist, pudgy and quiet.  HARRY ADAMS, 32,

     mathamatician, African-American, wire-glasses, no bullshit.

                         HARRY

               How much damage?

                         BARNES

               To the craft?  None.  Not a scratch.

                         HARRY

               Right.  So you're saying it survived

               a high speed impact with water

               without a scratch?

                         BARNES

               I'm not saying anything, Harry, I'm

               just stating the facts.

                    (continuing)

               The outer metal is made of a

               titanium alloy, built into an epoxy-

               resin honeycomb.  The necessary

               technology to bond this type of

               metal has never been invented.

                         TED

               Never invented?

     ON NORMAN, watching the team...

                         BETH

               In basic English, what does all this

               mean?

                         BARNES

               Basic English?  There's no way this

               spacecraft was constructed on our

               planet.

     A LOUD MECHANICAL WHIRR

     INT.  TESTING ROOM -- LATER

     A large, X-Ray APPARATUS moves to the side, revealing Norman's FACE.

     ON BETH -- standing next to him.

                         BETH

               Five years.  No phone calls.  What am

               I -- a leper?

     Norman sits up...

                         NORMAN

               Beth, look, can I trust you with a

               little secret?

                         BETH

               I love secrets.

                         NORMAN

               That ULF report everybody's patting

               me on the back about?

                         BETH

               I've read it twice, Norman.  It's

               brilliant.

                         NORMAN

               It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.

                         BETH

                    (beat)

               That's quite a secret.

                         NORMAN

               I spent a week reading Sagan and

               watching re-runs of the Twilight

               Zone.  Seriously.  I was just trying

               to pay the mortgage on my house -- I

               had no idea --

     ANGLE ON TWO NAVY CORPSMEN, standing behind glass in the next room,

     monitoring Beth and Norman.

                         BETH

               Do yourself a favor, Norman.  Are you

               listening?  Don't tell anyone what

               you just told me.

                         NORMAN

               C'mon, Beth -- that report's like

               the blind leading the blind.

                         BETH

               Because when we get down there --

                         NORMAN

               Wait -- down where?

                         BETH

               To the spacecraft.  To investigate.

                         NORMAN

               Underwater?

                         BETH

               What do you expect?  For them to

               bring it up here?

                         NORMAN

               We can't go down there.  We're not

               prepared.  That deep?  That takes

               years of training, Beth.  We're just

               scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear

               ties and lab coats to work -- not

               oxygen tanks.

                         BETH

               Well, you must have realized the

               chances an encounter like this would

               happen here.  In the ocean.

                    (off his look)

               70 percent of the earth's surface is

               water, Norman.  That's first grade

               geography.

                         NORMAN

               It never occurred to me.

                         BETH

               Well, let's pray that's the only

               mistake you made.  Have you said

               anything to Barnes about this?

                         NORMAN

               The timing has never seemed quite

               right.

                         BETH

               Just keep your mouth shut, alright?

               This could mean everything to our

               careers, you know that?  Don't

               jeopardize this.

                         NORMAN

                    (nervous laughter)

               What -- are you threatening me?

     EXT.  SHIP -- LATE AT NIGHT

     THE SKY -- clouds looming on the horizon.

     ANGLE ON ARTHUR LEVINE, leaning against the railing, looking out at

     the water.

     ON NORMAN, approaching him.  Arthur never looks at Norman, he just

     stares out at the water.

                         ARTHUR

               I don't know you, but I'll be honest

               with you.  I don't like this.  I don't

               like any of this.  Especially, the

               water.

                         NORMAN

               Seasick?  A marine biologist?

                         ARTHUR

               I don't belong here.  None of us

               belong here.  Look at that.

     ANGLE ON THE WATER, an ocean of seemingly endless, choppy waves.

                         NORMAN

               Makes you feel pretty small, doesn't

               it?

                         ARTHUR

               It scares the shit out of me.

                                                            CUT TO:

     CLOSE ON NORMAN, lying on a cot.  It is dark.  His eyes are open.  He

     stares at the ceiling.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  DESCENT PLATFORM

     A porthole hatch to the DESCENT SUB unlatches loudly.  A SUB-OFFICER

     help Norman lower himself through the hatch.

     INT.  DESCENT SUB

     Norman steps down the ladder into the sub compartment.  Seated in a

     circle area: Ted, Beth, Harry, and Arthur.  Ahead of them, Captain

     Barnes sits with the pilot in the sub's cockpit, separated by a wall

     of plexiglass.

     Norman takes a seat between Beth and Ted.

                         BARNES (O.S.)

                    (through the intercom)

               Our descent will take 13 minutes.

               Descending at a speed of 80 feet per

               minute.

     Across from Norman, Harry is WHISPERING something quietly into

     Arthur's ear.

                         BARNES (O.S.)

               Pressure adjustments will cause the

               sub to lurch at times, but don't be

               alarmed.  It's perfectly normal...

     Arthur's face drips with sweat, as Harry continues to whisper into his

     ear.

                         BARNES (O.S.)

               The sub's interior atmosphere will

               experience moisture as we descend,

               and the temperature will drop

               rapidly.  Just relax and remain

               seated during the descent.

     Norman watches Arthur, dripping with sweat.

                         BARNES (O.S.)

               We have clearing from the base.

     Red interior lights flicker on in the compartment, and WE HEAR the sub

     make a HISSING sound.  The sub lurches, and begins to lower in the

     water.

                         NORMAN

               Arthur?

     Harry has gotten to Arthur.  Arthur is on the verge of panic.

                         NORMAN

               Arthur?  You alright?

                         ARTHUR

               Open the hatch door, please.

     Harry continues to whisper in his ear.

                         ARTHUR

               Captain, open the hatch door, please

               ... the hatch door, Captain.  Open it,

               please.

                         BARNES (O.S.)

               Calm down, Dr. Levine.

                         ARTHUR

               Let me out, Captain.  Open the door!

                         BARNES (O.S.)

               Please, Dr. Levine.

     Arthur leaps violently out of his seat, scrambles to the plexiglass

     wall.

                         BARNES

                    (through the plexiglass)

               Sit down, Dr. Levine!  You're in a

               military operation now --

     Arthur bangs on the plexiglass wall with his fists.

                         BARNES

               ... Your civil rights have been

               overridden!

                         ARTHUR

               Open it, Captain!

                         BARNES

               Dr. Levine, please!  Return to your

               seat!

     Arthur VOMITS, violently, heaving, splattering the plexiglass wall.

                         ARTHUR

               Open the fucking door!

     The sub LURCHES again, coming to a stop.  The compartment is totally

     silent, as they begin ascending to the surface.

     ON HARRY smiling a sly, evil grin directed right at Norman.

     The sub lurches again, and WE HEAR clanking metal.  The hatch door

     opens.

     And Arthur, wiping the vomit from his mouth, climbs up the ladder and

     out the hatch door.

                         BARNES (O.S.)

               Anybody else?

     Silence.

     The hatch door LOCKS, loudly.  The sub lurches, and begins descending.

                         TED

               Pussy.

                         BETH

               What's that -- mistake number two,

               Norman?

                         NORMAN

               He wasn't feeling well.

                         TED

               He's a pussy.

     Harry is still staring at Norman...

                         HARRY

               How are you feeling, Norman?

                         NORMAN

               What?

                         HARRY

               You holding up alright?

                         NORMAN

               Fine.  I'm fine.

                         HARRY

               Don't be defensive.

                         NORMAN

               I'm not being defensive.

                         HARRY

               You sound defensive.

                         NORMAN

               I'm fine.

                         TED

                    (to Harry)

               What'd you say to him?

                         HARRY

               To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing

               that Norman doesn't already know.

                         TED

               What does Norman already know?

                         HARRY

               Norman thinks we shouldn't be going

               down.  Thinks it's a mistake.

     Norman looks over at Beth.

                         HARRY

               She told me what you said, Norman.

                         TED

               What is it, Harry?

                         HARRY

               Just one of Norman's many secrets.

     ON NORMAN, saying nothing.

     EXT.  OCEAN

     WE SEE the sub descending into darker waters.

     EXT.  DH-8 HABITAT -- ARRIVING DOCK

     The SUB descends into the AIRLOCK, metal clanks against metal.  Around

     it, the DH-8: interwoven cylinders lit up with lights.

     INT.  AIRLOCK -- PRESSURIZING ROOM

     CLOSE ON THE HATCH DOOR closing tightly, locking.

                         OFFICER (O.S.)

               One moment for pressurizing.

     A SOFT WHIRR.

     ANGLE ON -- Barnes and the four remaining team members standing in the

     small, claustrophobic pressurizing room.  Like sardines.  Nobody says

     anything.  A long beat.

     THE DOOR

     in front of them, opens.  TEENY FLETCHER, 30s, a big-boned female

     officer, stands before them.  She wears a black plastic PAD, a

     "talker", around her neck.

     She hands each member their own "talker".  Norman takes his.

     INT.  DH-8 HALLWAY

     Fletcher leads Barnes and the team members down the hallway.  Each of

     them wears the "talkers" around their necks.

                         BARNES

               They pressurize us with helium.

                         NORMAN

               What's wrong with oxygen?

                         BARNES

               It's a corrosive gas.  On earth, it

               makes a half-eaten apple turn brown

               and puts the ugly, iron rust on an

               Oldsmobile.  At a pressure this low,

               oxygen becomes toxic.  Breathe it

               down here, and it'll do to your dick

               what it does to the Oldsmobile.

                         TED

               Important safety tip.  Thanks

               Captain.

     Fletcher listens through her radio earpiece, turns to Barnes...

                         FLETCHER

               Captain, the divers have the airlock

               mounted at the door.  The robot is

               now in position to enter the

               spacecraft.

               Captain, you know, I really

               appreciate you hauling us a thousand

               feet below sea level so we can watch

               this historical event on television.

                         BARNES

               Nobody goes inside, until we know

what's

 inside.

     ON THE MONITOR -- THE ROBOT CAMERA scans the spacecraft hull, stops on

     a rectangular panel mounted to the left of the door.

                         BARNES

               Can you open that panel?

                         EDMUNDS

               Working on it now, sir.

     ON THE MONITOR -- a robotic CLAW extends out to the panel.  Trying to

     pry the panel open.

                         TED

               I'd like it noted in the report that

               I think we should be doing this

               ourselves.  Making a manned entry...

     The claw is clumsy, and keeps banging into the metal.

                         TED

               I'd also like it noted --

                         BARNES

               Duly noted, Ted.  Edmunds, try using

               suction.

     ON THE MONITOR -- another robotic arm extends out, with a rubber

     sucker.  It pushes against the panel, but doesn't suck.

                         EDMUNDS

               It's not sucking, sir.

                         BARNES

               Thank you, I can see that.  Try

               something else.

                         EDMUNDS

               We don't have anything else to try,

               Sir.

                         BARNES

               Well, shit -- find something, do

               something... make something up --

                         TED

               What about a crowbar?

     Barnes straightens up, looks at Ted...

                         BARNES

               What 

about

 a crowbar?

                         TED

               What if we go out there, you know --

               wedge a crowbar in the door and pry

               the thing open.

                         HARRY

               Pry the thing open?  What are we --

               neanderthals?

                         BETH

               All that banging and pounding.  I

               don't know.  We should think about

               making a good first impression.

                         HARRY

               For who?  The fish?

                         BETH

               For whoever's in that thing.

                         BARNES

               Or whatever's in that thing.

     ON THE MONITOR -- the spacecraft, sitting there silently, staring back

     at them.

                         BARNES

               Norman, what do you think?

     Norman, quiet in the corner, perks up...

                         NORMAN

               Me?  Well -- I don't really...  I

               mean, you could... you know, you

               could make a real solid case... a

               crowbar?

     All eyes on Norman.

                         NORMAN

               I don't know.

     A beat as they all stare at him.

                         TED

               I'm secure enough with that.

     INT.  CHANGING ROOM

     ANGLE ON A LOCKER door opening.  Inside is an elaborate JUMPSUIT and

     HELMET with the name: "JOHNSON", stenciled above the faceplate.

                         NORMAN

               Are we all -- I mean, is it

               necessary for all of us to go... out

               there?

     The other team members take their suits out of their lockers.

                         BARNES

               Nothing to be nervous about.  These

               suits are wired and electrically

               heated.  Each equipped with an alarm

               that triggers automatically if life-

               support sustems go below optimum.

     Norman holds his jumpsuit out and away from him, like it's something

     nuclear.

                         TED

               It's just like swimming, Norman...

               You know how to swim, don't you?

                         HARRY

               You're not afraid of the water, are

               you, Norman?

     They all look over at him.

                         BETH

                    (half smiling)

               Isn't there a psychological term for

               that, Dr. Johnson?

                         NORMAN

                    (under his breath)

               Yeah.  Drowning.

     INT.  AIRLOCK ROOM -- (A CYLINDER)

     Dressed in jumpsuits and helmets -- Barnes jumps into a POOL of ocean

     water, cut out from the floor, leading to the ocean.  It looks like a

     tiny swimming pool.  Ted jumps in next.  Beth, Harry, and Norman are

     left...

                         BETH

               You're next, Norman.

                         NORMAN

                    (nervous as hell)

               No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.

                         BETH

               Such a gentlemen when you're scared

               shitless.

     She hops in.  Norman watches, looks up at Harry, next to him.

                         HARRY

               Go ahead.  Ladies first.

                         NORMAN

               No, why don't --

     Harry nudges him forward.

                         HARRY

               C'mon.

                         NORMAN

               Wait a second, I --

     Harry pushes him again.  Norman catches himself.

                         NORMAN

               Geez, c'mon, alright.  Gimme a

               minute.  Let me get my bearings --

     Harry pushes him again.

                         HARRY

               C'mon, Norman.

                         NORMAN

               Look, would you --

     And Harry just pushes him in.  Norman slips and falls awkwardly... into

     the ocean depths.

                                                            CUT TO:

     BLACK.

     Quiet.  Only THE SOUND OF NORMAN -- BREATHING.

     For a couple beats.

     Now... NORMAN'S POV -- from inside his helmet -- a light SHINES from

     behind him -- casting his SHADOW onto the murky ocean floor.

     Norman's head turns, and he's BLINDED by a light -- it's Harry, the

     light SHINING from the top of Harry's helmet.

     WE HEAR Harry's voice, static, through Norman's helmet.

                         HARRY (O.S.)

               The switch is on your waist.

     ON NORMAN -- his GLOVE -- fumbling at his waist.

     HIS HELMET LIGHT -- FLICKERS on.

     ON NORMAN -- slowly, beginning to walk on the ocean floor.

     HIS FEET -- squashing gently, lightly into the muddy ground.

     NORMAN'S POV -- can barely make out the others in front of him, their

     helmet lights STROBING the dark water, crossing each other, like

     searchlights on a foggy night.

     CLOSE ON NORMAN'S FACE -- eyes cold, BREATHING.  Couple beats.  And

     HEARS:

                         TED (O.S.)

               Look at that thing.

     Norman's eyes look up... WE PULL BACK...

     LONG, HIGH, WIDE SHOT of the team -- their little helmet lights tiny

     and insignificant almost as...

     IN FRONT OF THEM -- the SPACECRAFT.  Dwarfing them in size, looming

     large, majestic, like nothing we've ever seen.  The enormous tail fin,

     in the distance, extends high out of the coral.

     In the huge MOUND OF CORAL covering the spacecraft, WE SEE a tunnel --

     cut out like a cave -- lined with tiny, dim lightbulbs.

     INT.  TUNNEL

     About 60 feet deep.  Narrower than they'd like.  Norman descends,

     clumsily, awkwardly -- pushing off the bulky, iron handles fastened to

     the coral walls.

     THE LOUD HISSING OF AIR

     INT.  SPACECRAFT AIRLOCK

     CLOSE ON NORMAN'S FACE as he watches the water recede, down past his

     faceplate.

     THE LOUD BANGING OF METAL

     Ted has wedged a crowbar into the door and BANGS at it with a

     sledgehammer.

                         HARRY

               Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.

                         TED

               Gimme some room here, will you?  Back

               off.  Gimme some space.

     They all back away, cramming into the far corner of the airlock as Ted

     keeps swinging.

                         BETH

               Looks alot like an airplane door,

               doesn't it?

     Ted stops and looks at the door.

                         TED

               Alot like.  You know, I noticed it

               before, but I didn't...

                         HARRY

               Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit.

               Keep hammering.

                         NORMAN

               You want me to try?

                         TED

               You're a 53 year old shrink, what

               are you gonna do?

                         BARNES

               Give him the hammer, Ted.

     Norman takes the hammer.  Walks up to the wedge.  Gets his bearings.

     Rears back... then stops.

                         TED

               What is it, your back give out?

     Something has caught Norman's eye.  He looks down at the wedge.

                         BARNES

               What is it, Norman?

                         NORMAN

               Take a look.

     Barnes comes toward him.  The others follow.  Barnes bends down, looks

     closely down at the wedge in the door.

                         BARNES

               It's chipped.

                         HARRY

               Chipped?  The door?  How can it be

               chipped?

                         BARNES

               I don't know how it can be chipped,

               but it's chipped.

                         HARRY

               I thought you said there wasn't any

               damage done in the crash?

                         BARNES

               I did.

                         HARRY

               Then how can it be chipped?

     ON BETH -- she touches the door with her palms, feels around.

                         BETH

               There's heat coming the door.

                         BARNES

               Back away then.

                         BETH

               Wait a minute --

                         BARNES

               I said back away.

                         BETH

               Would you wait a minute?

     THE DOOR STARTS TO RUMBLE

     Barnes unstraps a GUN -- nearly the size of an uzzi -- from his

     buckle.

                         BARNES

               Ted, get her away from the door.

                         TED

               What are you going to do -- shoot

               her?

     The RUMBLING louder...

                         BARNES

               Get her away!

     THE DOOR begins to slide open.

     Beth backs away.

     THE DOOR, sliding, is revealing COMPLETE BLACKNESS inside.  The door

     stops, it's open, it's quiet.  They all stand there, looking at

     BLACKNESS.  A long beat.

     INT.  SPACECRAFT

     ON NORMAN -- cautiously stepping inside.  His helmet light SHINES on the

     others ahead of him, walking along a 5 foot wide CATWALK, suspended

     high in the air.

     Metallic BEAMS and RAFTERS criss-cross above them.

     Norman looks over the railing -- his light STROBES through 40 feet of

     darkness, dimly lighting the LOWER HULL, a dense network of STRUTS and

     GIRDERS.

                         TED

               Look at this.

                         BARNES

               What is it?

     Ted SPOTLIGHTS the OUTER HULL.

                         TED

               Some sort of lead or something.

                         BARNES

               Radiation shield, you think?

                         TED

               A foot and a half thick?  That'd

               withstand a helluva lot of

               radiation.

     Beth's light SHINES down onto the CATWALK.  WE SEE FOOTPRINTS outlined

     on the dusty floor.

                         BETH

               Hold on --

                         BARNES

               What is it?

                         BETH

               Any of you get ahead of me -- walk

               this far up?

                         TED

               No.  I don't think so.

                         BETH

               Well, think.  Because there's

               footprints here that aren't mine.

                         TED

               Well, they're not mine.

     ON THE FOOTPRINTS -- large, like the boots they're wearing.

                         BARNES

               Calm down, alright?  They gotta be

               somebody's here.  Let's stay

               together, please.

                                                            CUT TO:

     LONG SHOT -- seeing them suspended high in the air on the catwalk,

     walking.  Their tiny streams of LIGHT moving about.  WE SEE just how

     ominous this spacecraft really is.

                         BETH

               It's empty.  Why would someone build a

               ship like this?

                         HARRY

               You'd have to ask them.

     They approach a DOOR, at the end of the catwalk.

                         BARNES

               Alright, Beth, do that thing you did

               before.

                         BETH

               How about I just press the button?

     She presses a button near the door.  The door SLIDES open.

                         BARNES

               Or just... press the button.

     Barnes holds out his gun, and enters.  The others behind him.

                         TED

               Strange, isn't it?  You know -- how

               it would have a button.

                         NORMAN

               Earth doesn't have a patent on

               buttons, Ted.

                         TED

               Still, make a note I recognized that.

     ON BARNES -- leading them through a small hall.  It seems to be opening

     up into some sort of room -- when Barnes stops.  Dead in his tracks.

                         TED

               What's wrong?

                         BARNES

                    (serious)

               What do you make of this?

     ON NORMAN -- as he steps around Barnes, his light BRIGHTENING on: A

     SIGN that reads: "Trash."

                         TED

                    (softly)

               What the hell?

     Very softly, Harry begins to laugh.

                         TED

               English?

                         HARRY

               That's right.

     Norman looks up and SEES more of the room as his light SHINES

     throughout it: TABLES, COUCHES and CHAIRS -- made of leather, very

     comfortable looking.

     They begin to slowly wander about... 

                         BETH

               I don't get it.

                         TED

               It doesn't make any sense.

                         HARRY

               You don't think it does?  I think

               it's rather obvious.

                         TED

               Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of

               those hoaxes?

                         HARRY

               A spacecraft half a mile long --

               with 500 tonnes of coral on top of

               it?  Someone went to a lot of

               trouble.  Try again.

                         TED

               But it's impossible.

                         HARRY

               Is it?

     Beth touches the table, it's metal, but it's soft and rubbery.

                         TED

               Why would this ship carry

               instructions in English?

                         HARRY

               Think about it.

                         TED

               Unless, this alien spacecraft was --

               you know -- somehow presenting

               itself to Americans in a way that

               would make us feel comfortable.

                         NORMAN

               400 years ago?  I'm sure Christopher

               Columbus would've loved these

               accomodations.

                         BETH

               Good theory, Ted.

                         TED

               Well, what's your theory?

                         BETH

               I'm a woman.  I don't theorize.  I

               only deal with facts.

                         HARRY

               All the facts you need are right in

               front of you.

                         TED

               Gimme a minute here... I think I've

               got it.

                         HARRY

               Do you?

                         TED

               If it is an alien spacecraft --

                         HARRY

               Save your breath.  It's not an alien

               spacecraft.

                         BETH

               Then what is it?

                         HARRY

                    (beat)

               It's an American spacecraft.

                         TED

               An American spacecraft?  Half a mile

               long?  And buried 400 years?  Yeah,

               good theory, Harry.

                         HARRY

               It's been obvious from the start,

               hasn't it, Captain?  That's why all

               the secrecy, why no one was told

               about it?

                         BARNES

               We had considered it.

                         TED

               Considered what?  That it's American?

               How would you think it's American?

                         HARRY

               The chip in the door.

     ON NORMAN -- glancing up at Harry... 

                         HARRY

               We take a weeny little wedge, bang

               on it a couple of times, and bust

               off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any

               spacecraft -- even at a low

               velocity, say 200 miles an hour --

               crashes into the water -- it's gonna

               be like hitting concrete, it would

               crumple like paper.  But there isn't

               a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even

               a scratch.

                         TED

               Meaning?

                         HARRY

               Meaning it didn't land in the water.

                         TED

               Please.  It must have flown here --

                         HARRY

               It didn't fly here.  It 

arrived

 here.

                         TED

               Arrived?  From where?

                         HARRY

               Not where.  When.  400 years ago.  From

               our future.

     A quiet moment as they take this in.

     INT.  SPACECRAFT -- DEEPER INSIDE

     Ted and Barnes trek through a vast cargo bay, like two ants wlth

     flashlights.

                         TED

               Time travel.  I always thought it was

               one of those myths... like Santa's

               reindeer.

                         BARNES

               What would we be working on in the

               future that would make us want to

               come back?

                         TED

               Maybe we didn't want to come back.

     BACK IN -- THE ROOM

     Norman, Harry, and Beth... 

                         BETH

               What are you looking for?

                         HARRY

               A light switch.  A button opened that

               door -- the craft runs on some sort

               of power.

     ON NORMAN -- as he sits down in one of the CHAIRS.

                         BETH

               What's that noise?

     They LISTEN to a GIRGLING NOISE.

                         NORMAN

               Sounds a little like water --

     SUDDENLY -- the chair Norman's in -- wraps around him, squeezing him

     inside, padding sliding around his head, his shoulders enveloping him

     -- sucking him inside... 

                         BETH

               Norman!

                         NORMAN

               Get this thing off me.

     Beth bends down, presses a button, the CHAIR releases Norman... 

                         BETH

               I think the chair thinks you want to

               fly this thing.

     ON BETH's FACEPLATE -- as she's looking down -- WE BEGIN TO SEE --

     reflected in her faceplate: yellow digital lettering sputtering

     across... 

     "RV-LHOOQ... DCOM1... "

     Her EYES look up slowly... as we

                                                            CUT TO:

     THE BLACK SCREEN in front of the chairs, lit up with bright yellow

     lettering:

     "RV -- LHOOQ -- DCOMl -- U.S.S STAR VOYAGER"

     "ASSIMILATING DATABASE" as a series of numbers race upwards in

     count... 

     And the desk in front of them LIGHTS UP, a control panel coming to

     life.  

                         HARRY

               Nice work, Norman.

                         NORMAN

               Whatever I can do to help.

     ON THE SCREEN as it changes, now filled with columns:

     SHIP SYSTEMS

     DATA SYSTEMS

     QUARTER MASTER

     FLIGHT RECORDS

     Harry punches some keys on the control panel.

                         HARRY

               A flight recorder.  Our future is

               about to be seen in our present.

     ON THE SCREEN as it changes:

     FLIGHT DATA SUMMARIES

     FDS 01/01/47-12/31/49

     FDS 01/01/50-12/31/52

     FDS 01/01/53-12/31/55

     FDS 01/01/56-12/31/56

     FDS 01/01/56-02/01/56

     FDS 02/02/56-UNKNOWN ENTRY EVENT

                         NORMAN

               01-01-47.  Two thousand-forty seven.

               50 years in our future.

                         HARRY

               Unknown Entry Event.

     Harry pauses, looks down, and punches more keys... 

     ON THE SCREEN -- as it expands in size, widens around them, curving... 

     WE SEE a galaxy of stars, planets coming OFF THE SCREEN, into the

     room, becoming three dimensional, suspended in air, giving the

     illusion of depth.

     The IMAGE begins streaking outward, TOWARD US, moving rapidly, like

     we're flying through it.

     The stars and other space matter streaking by.

                         BETH

               What's that cluster of stars there?

               In the center?

     Harry stares, walking around the desk, moving into the 3-D image... 

                         HARRY

               Our answer.

                         NORMAN

               To what?

                         HARRY

               Time travel.  A black hole.

     The CLUSTER of stars grows brighter and brighter, as it comes closer

     and closer, brightening.

     The FIELD twists and turns as the SCREEN and FIELD become BLINDING as

     WE ENTER the cluster, the black hole.

     ON NORMAN -- his face, bright, FRIGHTENED as he HEARS:

                         HARRY (O.S.)

               Ted?  Captain?

                         BARNES (O.S.)

               Yes, Harry.

                         HARRY (O.S.)

               We know how this craft got here.

               Where it's been.

                         BARNES (O.S.)

               So do we.  And it seems to have

               picked up something on it's travels.

     STILL ON NORMAN -- frightened... 

                         NORMAN

               Picked up something?  What is it?

                         BARNES (O.S.)

               I don't know.  But it's something

               alien.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  CARGO BAY

     ANGLE ON our six team members' BOOTS, in the distance.  AS WE PAN UP

     and AROUND WE SEE a curved surface appear: a surface of slowly

     swirling green and blue fluids.  Like mercury.  Mesmerizlng.

     AS WE COME AROUND, the team stands looking at the SPHERE, 30 feet in

     dlameter, held by a GIANT CLAW gripping it from the top.

     They walk around it, circling it, looking up at it.

                         HARRY	

               This answers one of our questions.

                         NORMAN

               Which one?  Let me get the list out.

                         HARRY

               This spacecraft was designed to pick

               things up.  They see things they want

               -- these claws go out and bring it

               in.  They come across this.  This... 

sphere

.  Find it interesting,

               curious.  They draw it inside to take

               back home.

                         NORMAN

               But on the way home, they miss their

               turn, go too far, into the past.

                         HARRY

               Our present.

                         BARNES

               But what does it do?  This... sphere.

                         TED

               Maybe it's a message of some sort,

               you know?  See this red here.

     ANGLE ON THE SPHERE -- some dark red MARKINGS on it's surface... 

                         TED

                    (continuing)

               Looks like a design, some writing,

               maybe.  Maybe it was sent to meet the

               spacecraft with a message.

                         HARRY

               Look closely.  That isn't writing.

               Those are grooves.

     ON THE RED GROOVES -- engraved into the surface.

                         HARRY

               No.  They don't represent a message.

               They aren't decorative at all.  They

               have another purpose entirely.

                         BARNES

               What?

                         HARRY

               To conceal a small break in the

               surface of the sphere.

                         BARNES

               A break for what?

     INT.  HABITAT -- HALLWAY

     DOWN A LONG CORRIDOR -- WE SEE Barnes, through a half-closed door,

     pacing, talking on the phone... 

                         BARNES

               ... it's definitely something alien

               ... another civilization, yes, sir... 

               Well, we don't know yet, but we

               think we've found a door... 

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

     Edmunds, Barnes, and the team members (minus Ted) look at the monitor.

                         BARNES

               So how do we get it open?

                         HARRY

               Ted seems to have some ideas.

     ON THE MONITOR -- Ted pushing on the SPHERE door.  Banging into it with

     his shoulder.

                         NORMAN

               Maybe we shouldn't.

                         BARNES

               What?

                         NORMAN

               If it is alien, maybe we shouldn't

               try to open it at all.

                         HARRY

                    (nodding to Norman)

               Man is man, all he knows is man, and

               all he can think of is what he

               knows.  The anthropomorphic problem.

               Good, Norman.

                         BARNES

               The what?

                         NORMAN

               I mentioned it in my report.  Didn't

               you read the report?

                         HARRY

               Everything ever written about extra-

               terrestial life imagines that life

               is essentially human.  If it doesn't

               look human, it's a reptile or a big

               insect or something, having human

               values, human understanding.

                         BARNES

               So?  What's the problem?

                         HARRY

               It's nonsense.  There's enough

               difference between our own species

               to prove that.

                         BETH

               Take politics, our views on

               abortion, the death penalty... 

                         HARRY

               Cannibalism, to be extreme.  And now

               we're talking about a new life form.

               Their values and ethics may be

               incomprehensible.

                         BARNES

               Like "Thou shall not kill"?

                         NORMAN

               Or maybe, it can't 

be

 killed.

                         BARNES

               You mean, what's in that thing is

               immortal?

                         NORMAN

               I don't know.  That's the point.

                         BARNES

               Everything can be killed.

                         BETH

               Not everything.  Even on earth.  Take

               ... yeasts.

                         BARNES

               Yeasts?  Thank you, Beth, but I don't

               think we're gonna open it up and

               find a loaf of bread.

                         HARRY

               And we're just talking about three-

               dimensional creatures.  What if it's

               five or six or seven-dimensional?  So

               dimensional that we couldn't even

               see it to kill it.

                         NORMAN

               Good point.  I don't know what you're

               talking about, but good point.

                         BARNES

               Or it could contain some great

               benefit to us, some astonishing new

               idea or technology to help mankind.

                         HARRY

               It could.  But the odds of it being

               any use to us are against it.

               Let's say whoever made this thing is

               a thousand years ahead of us, just

               like we are to, say, medieval

               Europe.  Suppose you went back to

               medieval Europe with a TV set.  There

               wouldn't be any place to plug it in.

     INT.  LIVING QUARTERS

     Harry on his bunk, staring at the wall, flicking his middle finger at

     his cheek: THWAP... THWAP.

                         HARRY

               You realize, Norman, that we are all

               going to die.

     Norman is lying in his own bunk, below Harry.

                         NORMAN

               Don't be so optomistic, Harry.

                         HARRY

               I'm completely serious.  There is

               something very important missing

               from that spacecraft.  You know what

               that is?

                         NORMAN

               Not a clue.

                         HARRY

               A sign that the builders knew time

               travel through a black hole was

               possible.

                         NORMAN

               I don't follow you.

                         HARRY

               On that flight recorder, they called

               the black hole an "Unknown Entry

               Event." They didn't know what a

               black hole was.  Fifty years from

               now, men are going to build that

               ship in a very tentative,

               experimental way, with no knowledge

               that time travel through a black

               hole is possible.

                         NORMAN

               So what?

     Harry leans his head over his bunk.

                         HARRY

               So, 

we know

.

                    (beat)

               We know it went through a black

               hole.  We saw it.  Norman -- when we'd

               get to the surface, we'd tell

               someone about the black hole,

               wouldn't we?  It'd go in some report

               like some big discovery.  So in fifty

               years when they build that ship,

               they'd make precautions for a black

               hole.

                    (beat)

But they didn't

.  The called it an

               Unknown Entry Event.

                         NORMAN

               Meaning we're never gonna get the

               chance to tell anyone.

                         HARRY

               Meaning we're never gonna get to the

               surface alive... to tell anyone.

     Norman gets out of his bed.

                         NORMAN

               I can't believe that, Harry.

                         HARRY

               Gimme another explanation.

     Norman pacing.

                         NORMAN

               I can't.  If I had a minute to think,

               maybe, but I know you're wrong.

                         HARRY

               Am I?

                         NORMAN

               Look -- we're under a lot of

               pressure, we're tired, you're not

               thinking straight.

                         HARRY

               You mean, you think I'm cracking?

                         NORMAN

               No.  I didn't say that.

                         HARRY

               Then what, Norman?

     Norman stops pacing, a beat.

                         NORMAN

               It's what's in that sphere, isn't

               it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in

               that thing -- you think it's going

               to kill you.

                         HARRY

               Curious, isn't it?  What's inside?

               Before I die, I'd sure like to open

               Where is he?  Damn it!  Can you see

     Harry lies motionless.

     Harry lies on his bunk.  He begins to slowly awake.

     WE BEGIN TO HEAR A SCRATCHING NOISE, like nails on a chalkboard.  It

     gets LOUDER as Harry comes to.  He puts his fingers to his temples.

     Norman stands beside, him writing in his notebook.

                         HARRY

               What is that?  That noise?

                         NORMAN

               What noise?

                         HARRY

               It's like... 

     ANGLE ON Norman's pen -- as he stops writing, the NOISE stops.

     Harry sighs.  Norman looks down at his pen.

                         NORMAN

               Harry, can you tell me about the

               sphere?

                         HARRY

               What are you still doing here?

                         NORMAN

               You remember opening the door?

                         HARRY

               You were all supposed to leave.  You

               weren't supposed to stay down here.

                         NORMAN

               Tell me about the door.  Do you

               remember how you opened the door to

               the sphere?... Harry?

                         HARRY

               You don't understand about the

               sphere.

                         NORMAN

               Then explain it to me.

     Harry pauses, staring almost like a frightened little boy.

                         HARRY

               Norman?

                         NORMAN

               What is it, Harry?

                         HARRY

               What happens on page 87?  Have you

               ever read page 87?

                         NORMAN

               Page 87 of what, Harry?

                         HARRY

               I could never read that far.  I never

               wanted to.

                         NORMAN

               That far in what, Harry?

     Harry doesn't say anything.  Norman waiting... 

                         HARRY

               You shouldn't be here, Norman.  It's

               too dangerous for you and the others

               to be down here.

               Yeah.  I heard you.

                         BARNES

               There are procedures, Beth, that I

               want followed.  My procedures.  And

               considering what's going on, I want

               you to follow them very closely.

     He walks to the door, then turns.

                         BARNES

               Salt's good for you, Ted.  Helps you

               from getting impotent.

                         TED

               out there earlier.  It's strange.

               It's dead down here, and then all of

               a sudden --

     Harry drops his fork.  He begins COUGHING.  HACKING.  CHOKING loudly.

     GAGGING.  He HACKS out the squid from his mouth...

               You said something to me, before --

               my senses are much keener though.

               Purer.  Hearing, seeing, smelling.

               Like, I can smell your sheets,

               Norman.  You tried to wash it out

               earlier, But I can still smell the

               Don't worry, I'm not going to tell

               What happened to you inside that

               sphere, Harry?

     A long beat.  Harry becomes concerned... 

                         HARRY

               Why?  Does someone else want to go

               inside?

     suit... 

                         FLETCHER (O.S.)

               I can't see, they're smearing the

     Fletcher's suit tears... 

                         BARNES

               Fletcher, get away from there... 

                         FLETCHER (O.S.)

               It's burning... 

                         BARNES

               Get out of there!

                         FLETCHER (O.S.)

               I can't see... 

                         BARNES

               Fletcher!  Now!

                         FLETCHER (O.S.)

               I can't... 

     ON BETH -- bolting out of the room.  Barnes turning to her... 

                         BARNES

               Nobody move.

                         BETH

               Nobody move!

     faceplate... she's COUGHING, GASPING.

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

     They watch... 

     ON THE MONITOR -- Her body twisting, contorting.  Her suit, ripping

     apart.  SCREAMING.  She convulses.  Her body falling.

     HER HORRIFYING SCREAM FADING INTO... 

     INT.  DECONTAMINATION LAB

     CLOSE ON -- Fletcher's face.  Cold, dead.  Eyes open.  Jellyfish rooted in

     her skin.

     CLOSE ON A MICROSCOPIC IMAGE of a jellyfish.

     ON NORMAN -- in the corner of the lab, inspecting a MEDICAL KIT.

                         NORMAN

               What is this, Beth?  You taking

               valium?

     Beth, looking into the microscope.

                         BETH

               Sedatives.  Whatever my mood calls

               for.

     Norman picks up a book, next to the kit: 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.

                         NORMAN

               Where'd this come from?

                         BETH

               The library.

                         NORMAN

               We have a library?

                         BETH

               A bad one.  It was the only book in

               there.  Norman, come here, look at

               this.

                         NORMAN

               No, thank you.  I hate jellyfish.

     Walking toward her... 

                         NORMAN

               ... when I was six, my younger

               brother and I -- we went swimming in

               the Pacific.  At my mother's beach

               house.  We both felt stinging, and

               when we came out of the water, he

               was wearing jellyfish head to toe.

               Killed him.

                         BETH

               My gosh, Norman.

                         NORMAN

               Yeah, it was awful.

                         BETH

               What about you?  What happened to

               you?

                         NORMAN

               Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed.

               It itched for a while, but I

               survived.

                    (beat)

               Beth, do you find it... curious that

               we're seeing all this life down

               here.  Nothing, and then these

               enormous flocks of squid.  Then

               jellyfish?

                         BETH

               Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's

               quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no

               electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's

               curious is -- these aren't normal

               jellyfish.

                         NORMAN

               What do you mean -- not normal?

                         BETH

               They have six tentacles.  A new

               species.  And the squid too.  They had

               no stomach.

                         NORMAN

               Wait a minute.

                         BETH

               What?

                         NORMAN

               You knew about the squid not being

               normal.  Before Fletcher went out

               there?

                         BETH

               Yeah, why?

                         NORMAN

               And you didn't tell anyone?

     Beth, nervous... 

                         BETH

               What?  Why... 

                         NORMAN

               Beth --

                         BETH

               I mean, I'm not... I wasn't

               absolutely sure if... they --

                         NORMAN

               They are or they aren't.  Which is

               it?

                         BETH

               What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are

               you --

                         NORMAN

               Beth.

                         BETH

               Nobody said... Norman...  What?  Why

               are you looking at me like that?

                         NORMAN

               Beth --

     She backs away from Norman, knocking off a speciman jar, it SHATTERS

     on the floor.  She starts breaking down.

     Norman watching her, falling to the ground, picking up the glass,

     hurriedly... 

                         BETH

               I didn't do anything wrong.  I didn't

               mean... 

                         NORMAN

               Beth.

     She's crying, glass in her hands.  She looks up at Norman, frightened,

     nervous... 

                         BETH

               You wouldn't go and tell the others,

               would you?

     Norman hesitates, goes to her, tries to hold her, but she pushes him

     away.

                         BETH

               I hate this place, Norman.  I want

               out.

     Barnes sits, Norman in front of him, worked up... 

                         NORMAN

               I'm not paranoid.  I know Beth.  She

               can be drastic.

                         BARNES

               How drastic?

                         NORMAN

               You don't want to know.

                         BARNES

               I think I do.

                         NORMAN

               A while back, Beth and I -- we

               worked at the same university.  She

               was assisting a chemist there -- I

               forget his name -- doing research,

               experiments.  She was also living

               with him.

                    (off Barnes' look)

               Yeah, I know.  And when she finished

               her work, he kicked her out, broke

               off the relationship, and published

               five papers -- all her work --

               without any thank you or

               acknowledgement.

                         BARNES

               She should've known better.

                         NORMAN

               She put a razor to her wrists a day

               later.

                         BARNES

                    (a beat)

               When was this?

                         NORMAN

               '81, I think.  She tried again five

               years ago.

                    (beat)

               I thought you should know.

                         BARNES

               So you knew this when you wrote your

               report?

                         NORMAN

               At the time, I don't know, I thought

               putting her on the list -- it might

               help her career -- catch her a

               break.

                         BARNES

               You knowingly recommended a woman

               with suicidal tendencies for a

               You know, Ted said something to me

               earlier.  I think he's right.  He

               said, "When you got a guy who -- if

               he wasn't here -- he'd be standing

               in the unemployment line, you gotta

               question if you got the right guy."

               It's a single sequence repeated over

               and over.

                         TED

                         EDMUNDS

               We're not hooked up to the sphere.

               It's not a discharge.  Right,

               Edmunds?  You said before, right?  So

               it's gotta be a message.

                         BARNES

               From the sphere?

                         HARRY

               If it is a message, it's probably a

               substitution code.  I'll work on it.

                         TED

               Yeah, I'll work on it, too.

               He's manic, Norman.  You know that?

               This reliance on Harry is misplaced.

               You hear me?  Totally misplaced.  He's

               overlooking things.  Obvious things.

                         NORMAN

               Like what?

     Ted hands him a printout... 

                         TED

               It's not some fucking substitution

               code, it's a direct visual

               Don't you see it?  It's a picture of

               the creature.

                         NORMAN

               The creature?

                         TED

               Inside the sphere.  Look, that's the

               vertical torso, three legs, two

               arms.  There's no head, so I'm

               guessing the creature's head is

               located within the torso itself, you

               know?

     ON NORMAN -- Ted's lost it.

                         NORMAN

               Well, how about we wait and see what

               Harry comes up with?

                         TED

               Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy.

               That pretentious son of a bitch.  You

               heard him, Norman.  All that "someone

               went to a lot of trouble, try again"

               bullshit.  And "impotent".  Where does

               he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's

               a fucking self-righteous, little

               prick.

     CLOSE ON MONITOR -- spirals now.

                         HARRY

               ... I asked myself, why would the

               sphere be using a code?  If you're

               trying to communicate, why use a

               code?

                         TED

                    (to Norman)

               See?  No code.  What'd I say?

                         HARRY

               Codes are for 

hiding

 information.  So

               it's making a mistake.  It's making a

               code without intending to.  I figured

               it's probably substituting numbers

               for letters...  Then I began to wonder

               what an alien intelligence would

               make of our keyboard.  And since

               we're getting spirals, I imagined

               the keyboard as a spiral.  So I

               translated it... 

                         NORMAN

               That's brilliant.

     Ted grimaces at Norman.

                         HARRY

               ... spiralling out of the center, you

               see: "G" is one, "B" is two, "H" is

               three, and so on... when I got the

               message.

                         BARNES

               What's the message?

                         HARRY

               I have to tell you.  It's strange.

                         BARNES

               How do you mean, strange?

     Harry picks up his yellow pad of paper and reads:

                         HARRY

               "Hello.  How are you?  I am fine.  What

               is your name?  My name is Jerry."

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  HALLWAY

     Barnes walks briskly down the hall, Norman with him... 

                         BARNES

               He translated it wrong.  "My name is

               Jerry"?  It's like "See Spot run."

                         NORMAN

               The message doesn't show a lack of

               intelligence.  It's smart.  It's

               approaching us in a simple way.  Like

               you would a dog.  Holding out your

               hand, letting it sniff, get used to

               you.

                         BARNES

               What am I -- a dog, now?

     Barnes ducks his head into the Video Feed room... 

                         BARNES

               Edmunds, get in here.  I need you for

               this.

                         EDMUNDS

               In a minute, sir.

     Barnes storming through the room, the others (minus Edmunds) around

     the monitor.

                         BARNES

               I want a name.  A real name.  This

               thing's full name, rank and serial

               number.

                         TED

               Captain, I personally feel we should

               ask much more substantive

               questions --

                         BARNES

               I am not gonna explain in some damn

               report that one person died in a

               deepsat expedition so we could meet

               an alien named Jerry.

                         HARRY

                    (on the keyboard,

                    typing)

               First, we have to see if he'll talk

               at all.

     The monitor BLINKS, reply:

               "We are friends".

                         HARRY

               "Yes".  Good.  Now let's see if it'll

               switch over to English letters.

               It's not talking, it's mimicking.

                         TED

               Give him a chance.  He's speaking our

               language, not the other way around.

               Ignorant.  The thing's ignorant.

                         HARRY

               It's not ignorant.

                         TED

               That's smart.  Let's talk about guns

               and violence.

                         BARNES

               I think we should be careful.

               Consider his emotional response.

                         TED

               You want to put him on your couch,

                         NORMAN

               When he uses a phrase like "I am

               Happy", I think we should think

               twice about what we ask him.

     "Do Not Be Afraid"

               power and understanding.

     "Thank you"

                         NORMAN

               know that we are entities who must

               talk in private -- with each other.

     "Do Not Be Afraid"

                         NORMAN

               We're not afraid, we are

               uncomfortable.

     "Am I offended you?"

                         NORMAN

               Not at all, we enjoy you very much,

               but we need to talk alone, without

               you listening.

     "I shall oblige"

               without any hard data to back it up.

                    (into intercom)

               Edmunds?

                         NORMAN

               Because if Jerry is powerful and

               also emotional... 

                         BARNES

               Damn it, Edmunds?

                         NORMAN

               ... it raises a very serious

               question: 

What happens if Jerry

gets mad

?

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

                         BARNES (O.S.)

               Edmunds?  Can you copy?

     An empty chair.  Edmunds is not here.  WE HEAR a repeating THUMP.  THUMP.

     THUMP.

                         BARNES (O.S.)

               Edmunds?

     ON A MONITOR -- WE SEE her body, wedged in a light stand bracket,

     floating in the water, lifeless.  Her helmet THUMPING against the wall

     of the habitat.

     INT.  UNDERWATER -- OUTSIDE THE HABITAT

     Norman and Beth, in jumpsuits and helmets, walk out from under the

     habitat.  Still HEARING the THUMPING.  They pause, looking around.

                         BETH

               Coast is clear.

     They go to the south end of the habitat.  The THUMPING louder.

     Norman climbs up the grid-like STANCHION, the support beam holding up

     the habitat.  The BODY above him -- flapping in the current.  THUMPING

     against the wall.

     He climbs, reaching the body.  A BOOT swings, catches the LOOP in his

     air hose.  BUBBLES shoot out.

                         BETH

               Norman, your suit -- it's leaking.

     The BOOT comes off in Norman's hand -- and the NAKED FOOT, gray flesh,

     purple toenails, KICKS his faceplate.  Startles him.

                         BETH

               Norman.  Look at this.

     ON EDMUNDS' SUIT -- a long TEAR in the fabric, revealing red, mangled

     FLESH.  Droplets of BLOOD float past Norman's faceplate.

                         BETH

               Her flesh has been macerated.

               Chewed.  I've never seen a bite like

               this before.

     Norman pulls her body out.

     Edmunds' FACEPLATE whips around -- and Norman SEES her staring eyes,

     mouth open in horror.

                         NORMAN

               I can't feel her bones.  She's like a

               sponge.

                         BETH

               She was crushed.  Feel her skin --

               it's like sandpaper.

                         NORMAN

               What could have done this?

     WE HEAR A SENSOR: PONG.  PONG.  PONG.

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

     Barnes at the monitors, Ted with him.

     PONG.  PONG.  PONG.

                         TED

               What is that?

                         BARNES

               The sensors are picking up something

               outside.

                         TED

               What?

     Barnes flips a switch... 

                         BARNES

               It won't register.  It's too big to

               image.

                         TED

               Too big?

     EXT.  UNDERWATER

     WHITE EGGS, the size of golf balls descend from above.  Hundreds of

     them.  Beth catches one, inspects it... 

                         BETH

               Norman.

                         NORMAN

                         BETH

               Eggs.

     From inside their helmets... 

                         BARNES (O.S.)

               You people need to hurry back.  The

               sensors have activated.  I don't

               think you're alone out there.

     INT.  CORRIDOR

               What was it?

                         TED

               Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a

               reading.

                         NORMAN

               Has Harry spoken with Jerry?

                         TED

               Not that I know of.  Why?

     INT.  COMMUNICATIONS ROOM

     Norman and Ted at the console... 

                         NORMAN

               Jerry?

     No reply.

                         NORMAN

               Jerry, are you there?

     No reply.

                         TED

               You think Jerry has something to do

               with what killed Edmunds?  With

               what's out there?

                         NORMAN

               I'm not sure.

     INT.  LABRATORY

     CLOSE ON AN EGG

     Beth, scalpel in hand, is making an incision into the shell.

                         BETH

               Looking at the coating here, it's

               definitely marine invertebrate.

     Barnes, Norman, Harry and Ted stand around the table.

                         BARNES

               Well, until we know exactly what it

               is, nobody goes outside, understood?

                         TED

               What was Edmunds doing outside?

                         BARNES

               Resetting the sub.

                         TED

               What sub?

                         BARNES

               In the dome hanger.  All our tapes

               are transferred to the sub.  It's on

               a 12 hour timer.  If someone doesn't

               reset the "delay" button, the sub

               ascends to the surface with the

               tapes.

                         NORMAN

               What for?

                         BARNES

               If something should happen to us,

               the Navy will at least have partial

               records of what happened.

                         NORMAN

               At least our obituaries will be

               accurate.  That's reassuring.

     ON THE EGG -- splitting open.  A slimy pinkish-brown FLUID oozes out.  A

     FETUS underneath.

     They cover their mouths from the smell.

                         BARNES

               What is it?

     Beth picks at it with forceps... 

                         BETH

               I'm not sure.  I've never seen

               anything like it.

                         BARNES

               You're a fucking biochemist, aren't

               you?  Can't you tell us something.

     Beth glares at Barnes... 

     INT.  CLOSET AREA -- DARK

     Beth, holding a piece of paper in her hand, pulls Norman inside,

     pressing on him... 

                         BETH

               ... He lied to us.  He left us down

               here.

                         NORMAN

               C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this

               personal.  He told me himself they

               were taking us back.

                         BETH

               Yeah, he 

told

 you.  Think.  What was

               Barnes doing before they cut that

               cable loose?  He was on the phone.

               Except that cable is a thousand feet

               long, Norman.  They would've broken

               off communication with us four, five

               minutes before they cleared out.

                         NORMAN

               So what?

                         BETH

               So who was Barnes talking to at the

               last minute?  Nobody.

                         NORMAN

               You're jumping to conclusions, Beth.

               Don't get worked up --

                         BETH

               Fuck you, Norman!  It's right here... 

     She shows him the printout in her hand, putting a flashlight on the

     words, reads... 

                         BETH

               "Although advised of risks, all

               personnel elect to remain down for

                         NORMAN

               Where did you get this?

                         BETH

               In Edmunds' things.

                         NORMAN

               You went through Edmunds' things?

                         BETH

               He's not just a Navy captain -- he

               works for the fucking Pentagon.

                         NORMAN

               Calm down, Beth.  Alright?

                         BETH

               Don't tell me to calm down!

                         NORMAN

               It's done, alright?  It's over!  And

               there's not a damn thing we can do

               about it now, okay?

     He turns to leave... 

                         BETH

               You said something to him, didn't

               you?

                         NORMAN

               What?

                         BETH

               You told him about me?

     ON NORMAN -- pausing, staring at her... 

                         NORMAN

               Beth --

                         BETH

               You did, didn't you?

                         NORMAN

               Don't do this.

                         BETH

               You bastard.

                         NORMAN

               Beth, I didn't.  Hold it together.

               Alright?

     She looks at him, piercing into his eyes... 

                         BETH

               Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman.

                         NORMAN

               Beth --

                         BETH

               No, I should stay calm.  Like you

               say.  Right, Norman?  Stay calm.

     Norman looks at her, concerned, knowing she doesn't believe him... 

                         BETH

               Fletcher and Edmunds are dead,

               Norman.  And the only one we can

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

     Barnes, Norman, Beth, and Ted are gathered around the monitors.  Barnes

     addresses Norman... 

                         BARNES

               I don't want you talking to Jerry.

                         NORMAN

               But sir, I think it's imperative.  I

               think the messages, the animals

               we've seen, what killed Edmunds, the

               reading you got earlier -- I think

               they're all related.

                         TED

               Jerry isn't hostile, Norman.  He said

               earlier -- we were his friends --

                         NORMAN

               Of course he did.  He's been isloated

               for 400 years.  He wants someone to

               talk to.  Look, you put a human being

               in isolation for four days, they can

               become neurotic, sometimes

               psychotic.  We're talking about 400

               years here.  An alien that shows

               emotional responses.  I think we need

               to address him, before he reacts

               further.

                         BARNES

               You think he killed Edmunds?

                         NORMAN

               Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I

               think is his response to us refusing

               to talk to him earlier.

                         BARNES

               Bullshit.  What's out there isn't

               alien.  It's an animal.

                         NORMAN

               Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask

               Jerry about it.

                         BARNES

               No.  I think we should shut down the

               communication lines inside the

               habitat.  He might be listening now.

                         BETH

               I think he already is.

     They turn to the monitors:

     ON THE MONITOR: "DO NOT IGNORE ME"

               Nice work, Captain sir.

                         BARNES

               Shut up, Beth.  I don't want to hear

               it.

                         NORMAN

               Jerry, we don't want to ignore you.

               We're a habitat.  Not a castle.  The

               only defense we have is High

               Voltage.

                         BETH

               High Voltage?

                         BARNES

               It sends 200 volts throughout the

               cylinder surface.  But we've never

               used it underwater before.

     PONG.  PONG.  PONG.

                         BARNES

               Forty yards.

                         BETH

               But you've tested it?

                         BARNES

               Sure.  Each time it started fires

               inside the habitat.

     PONG.  PONG.  PONG.

                         BARNES

               Thirty yards.

               What are you saying -- we can't stop

               what's out there?

     THE MONITORS blink: "I AM COMING".  The monitor blinks to BLANK.

                         BARNES

               What the hell?

                    (bangs on the monitors)

               It shut us down.

                         NORMAN

               Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.

                         BARNES

               Ted, go into the control room.

               Listen for my instructions.

     Ted goes out the door.

     ALL THE MONITORS -- blank.

                         BETH

               Where is it?

                         BARNES

               Why can't I -- ?  What the hell is

               going on here?

     They HEAR a metallic CLANKING.

                         BETH

               What was that?

                         BARNES

               He's right beneath us.

     THE MONITORS blink: "I AM HERE".

     Harry looking at the FETUS on the table.  It suddenly SLIDES down the

     The room is rocked.

     ON SHELVES -- Jars, petry dishes, test tubes SLIDE off shattering to

     the floor.

     INT.  CORRIDOR

     BANG!

     TED is thrown ruthlessly against the wall.  His HEAD striking metal,

     splitting open his forehead.

     THE WALLS -- CRACKING and GROANING.

     WATER breaks through a crack, spreading out onto the floor.

               That's our reserve air.

                         BARNES

               It's either that or we grow gills.

     BANG!  They grip onto the console... 

     INT.  CONTROL ROOM

     Ted, drousy, BLOOD gushing from his head, keeping balance, searches

     for the PRESSURE GAGE.

                         BARNES (O.S.)

               Ted?  Ted, are you with me?

     Finds the GAGE.  Turns it.

               Increasing positive pressure.

     EXT.  HABITAT -- UNDERWATER

     AIR BUBBLES burst out of the walls.

     INT.  CORRIDOR

     ON THE FLOOR -- the WATER scurrying back through the leaks in the wall.

     Barnes, watching the monitors.

                         BARNES

               That's enough Ted.

     INT.  CONTROL RROM

     THE PRESSURE GAGE -- the needle RISING...

               Ted?  Ted!

     ON TED -- passed out on the floor.  Blood covering his face.

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

     Beth and Norman BOLT out the door

     INTO THE HALLWAY

     Running.  BANG!  They're thrown against the wall.

     INT.  CONTROL ROOM

     THE PRESSURE GAUGE -- rising, higher, higher.

     INT.  CORRIDOR

     THUMP!  Norman and Beth, losing their balance, stumbling to their

     feet, running... 

     ON TED -- SLIDING out of the Control Room, down the corridor, taken by

     the water.

     Beth grabs him, as Norman stumbles

     INTO THE CONTROL ROOM

     finds the PRESSURE GAGE, shuts it off.

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

     BANG!  Barnes grips his headset as he's thrown to the floor.

                         BARNES

               Norman!  Norman can you hear me?

     INT.  CONTROL ROOM

     Norman grabs the headset, slips it on... 

                         NORMAN

               Yes, sir.  I'm here.

                         BARNES (O.S.)

               You see the lever on the green box?

               Upper right hand corner?

     Norman sees it, reads it:

                         NORMAN

               High Voltage Defense System.

     ON BETH -- in the hall, tending to Ted, looks up at Norman.

     ON NORMAN -- turning from Beth, to the lever.

                         NORMAN

               I see it.

                         BARNES (O.S.)

               Pull it.

                         BETH

               Don't pull it, Norman.  It'll start a

fire

 we can't stop.  Norman?

                         BARNES (O.S.)

               Do it, Norman, it's the only choice

               we have.  This thing is gonna crush

               us.

                         BETH

     He PULLS the lever.

     INT.  HABITAT

     DOWN THE CORRIDORS -- a loud HUM from the generators.  The lights

     DIMMING.

     BANG!  WE HEAR what seems to be a SQUEAL, as the metal RENDS and

     CREAKS.

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

     An ALARM SOUNDS.

     Barnes looks up... 

     THE WARNING BOARD lights up.

     FIRE ROARS out from the walls...

     CLOSE ON FIRE EXTINGUISHER CASE -- Beth whips it open, grabs it.

     ON NORMAN -- picking up Ted, lugging him awkwardly over his shoulder.

     ON BARNES -- running down the corridor towards them.

     BANG!  Barnes falls to the floor, taken away by the water.

     hears... 

                         BARNES (O.S.)

               Help!

     She looks DOWN THE CORRIDOR at... 

     BARNES -- on the floor, flailing in the water, SCREAMING, as his legs

     are caught in a CRACK in the wall.  Desperate... 

                         BARNES

               Beth!  Help, I can't -- !

     ON BETH -- staring at him.  Just watching him.  Not moving.

                         BARNES

               Beth!

     BARNES -- his body falling through the crack, his HEAD BANGS into the

     wall, stuck in the crack, water choking him... 

                         BARNES

               Be--

     ... trying to SCREAM, his NECK RIPPING, SNAPS, and his body vanishes

     into the ocean.

     ON BETH -- cold, turns away.

     INT.  COMMUNICATIONS ROOM

     FIRE blasts out from the wall... 

     BETH and NORMAN (still with Ted) wearing GAS MASKS, RUSH into the

     room... 

                         BETH

               Stay low!

     Beth sprays WHITE FOAM on the fierce FLAMES, licking up the side

     padding, smoke boils to the cieling.

     BANG!  The room is rocked.

                         NORMAN

               It won't stop.

     Norman falls to the floor, losing Ted.

     TED -- SLIDES away and UNDER the computer CONSOLE.

     BANG!  The computer CONSOLE breaks -- COMPUTERS, MONITORS, fall,

     CRUSHING on Ted's legs.  He SCREAMS out in agony.

     NORMAN scrambles towards him through the smoke when... 

     THE CONSOLE catches fire, erupts in flame.  Ted underneath it.

     BETH -- her extinguisher out of foam.

     NORMAN -- runs to a wall, finds an EXTINGUISHER CASING, it's been bent,

     can't get it open.

     TED -- reaches out in desperation as his LEGS catch fire.

                         TED

               Norman!

     NORMAN -- BASHES the casing in with his shoulder, grabs the

     extinguisher, turns... 

     TED -- his entire body on fire.

     BANG!  Norman falls, dropping the extinguisher -- it rolls across the

     floor.  He reaches out -- can't get it.

     CLOSE ON TED -- his face burning... 

                         TED

               Norman!  Nor--

     BANG!  The lights go out.

     DARKNESS

     NORMAN -- watches in horror as he watches TED, lit in flame, burning to

     death.

     NORMAN -- reaches for the wall for balance, grabs METAL, and he's

     ELECTRICUTED.  Falls backward, head first, and EVERYTHING GOES... 

     BLACK

     A long beat.

                         NAVY SEAMAN (O.S.)

               Dr. Johnson?  Dr. Johnson?

     INT.  COMMUNICATIONS ROOM

     WE FOCUS in on Norman, as he awakens.  NAVY SEAMAN, 40s, African-

     American, standing above him.

                         NAVY SEAMAN

               Norman Johnson.

                         NORMAN

               Does this mean what I think it

               means?

                         NAVY SEAMAN

               It's over, sir, The storm has

               cleared.

                         NORMAN

               The ships?

                         NAVY SEAMAN (O.S.)

               They're topside.  We're ready to take

               you home, sir.

     The Navy Seaman helps Norman to his feet.  Norman is smiling, it's

     over.

     INT.  HALLWAY

     Norman and the Navy Seaman walk down the hall.

                         NORMAN

               How are the others?

                         NAVY SEAMAN

               The others, sir?

                         NORMAN

               Beth and Harry?

                         NAVY SEAMAN

               They're in the sub, sir.  Waiting.

     Norman sighs, smiling.  The relief, the jubilation.

                         NORMAN

               That whole time -- I couldn't stop

               thinking of what Harry was saying

               earlier... 

                         NAVY SEAMAN

               What was that, sir?

                         NORMAN

               About the time paradox.

                    (the Seaman nodding)

               How we were all going to die --

               that there was no way we would make

               it out of here alive --

     As Norman looks up, the Navy Seaman, still walking and nodding, begins

     to slowly DISAPPEAR.  Disintigrating.  VANISHING before his eyes.

     Norman stops, looks around him.  He's gone.

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

     Norman watches on a monitor -- the VIDEO of him walking down the hall,

     the Navy Seaman walking next to him.

                         NORMAN (O.S.)

               ... how we were all going to die --

               that there was no way we would make

               it out of here alive --

     ON THE MONITOR -- the Seaman disappers.

     Norman stops tape.  Looks over at the MONITOR showing the SPHERE.  It is

     closed.

     THE SCREEN goes BLACK.  Flashes up: "Hello Norman"

                         NORMAN

               Jerry?

     "Yes Norman"

                         NORMAN

               Jerry, did you create that man?

     "The entity Navy Seaman was a Manifestation.  Did you have a Happy

     talk?"

                         NORMAN

               Jerry, are you manifesting what's

               destroying our habitat?

     "Did you have a Happy talk?"

                         NORMAN

               Jerry, answer me.

     "No."

                         NORMAN

               Jerry?

     A beat.

     "Stop calling me Jerry"

     The MONITOR shuts off.

     Norman looks over at ANOTHER MONITOR labled "AIRLOCK FEED".

     ON THE SCREEN -- Beth is putting on her jumpsuit.

     INT.  AIRLOCK

     REFLECTED IN THE POOL OF WATER -- WE SEE Beth, slipping on her boots.

                         NORMAN (O.S.)

               Where are you going in such a hurry?

                         BETH

               I have to reset the sub.

     Norman stands in the doorway... 

                         NORMAN

               Forget the sub.

                         BETH

               Don't bother me, Norman.

                         NORMAN

               It's not worth the risk.

                         BETH

               It's also our only way out of here!

               It holds three people.  And there's

               only three of us left now.

                         NORMAN

               You, me and Harry?

                         BETH

               You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.

                         NORMAN

               Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get

               outta --

                         BETH

               We can't.  The storm.  The waves would

               toss us around worse than we got

               down here.  And we have four days of

               decompression when we get up top.

                         NORMAN

               Four days?

                         BETH

               Get the helium out of our

               bloodstream.  We go to the surface

               now, we'd pop like a soda bottle.

     She begins to put on her helmet, when she stops.

                         BETH

               Maybe you should go.  To the sub.

                         NORMAN

               Why should I go?

                         BETH

               You should know how it works.  Just

               in case.

                         NORMAN

               In case you die, too?

                         BETH

               I don't trust Harry to do it.

                         NORMAN

               I would.  But my suit --

                         BETH

               I fixed your suit.

     She goes to it.  Brings it to him.

                         NORMAN

                    (watching her closely)

               You fixed my suit?

                         BETH

               You don't trust me?

                         NORMAN

               But I don't know how --

                         BETH

               You press a button, Norman.  It's not

               brain surgery.  Here, go ahead.  You

               only have 15 minutes to reset it.  Go

               on, Norman... 

     She hands him a BRIEFCASE, the tapes inside.

                         BETH

               ... I'll watch the sensors for you.

     EXT.  UNDERWATER

     Norman drops to the bottom with the BRIEFCASE.  Lands on the ground.

     BREATHING.  Checks his LIFE SUPPORT BADGE.  She must've fixed it.

                         BETH

               You're clear, Norman.

     He walks along, out from under the habitat.  Carefully, looking around.

                         BETH (O.S.)

               The sub's a 100 feet in front of

               you.  You see it?

                         NORMAN

               I can't see anything.  How does it

               look?  Still clear?

                         BETH (O.S.)

               Still clear.

     Norman, hesitantly, ventures out.  The DARK WATER.  Looking around.

     Anything could be out here.  Walking.  WE HEAR him BREATHING.  His

     BREATHING gets shorter.  He looks at his LIFE SUPPORT BADGE.

                         BETH (O.S.)

               What's the matter?

                         NORMAN

               You fixed this suit?

                    (no reply)

               Beth?

                         BETH (O.S.)

               Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just

               nervous.

                         NORMAN

               My air isn't... I'm coming back.

                         BETH (O.S.)

               You can't.  Counter's at 10 minutes.

               You don't have time.

     His BREATHING is short, but managable.  He continues on.

     AHEAD OF HIM -- the DOME HANGER attached to a large, gray cylinder,

     forty feet high.

                         NORMAN

               Still clear?

                         BETH (O.S.)

               Still clear.

     UNDERNEATH THE DOME HANGER -- Norman climbs up to the hatch DOOR.  Looks

     below him.  Nothing around him.  He SPINS the wheel, and pushes the

     HATCH OPEN.  Lifts himself up, awkwardly.  Grabs HANDHOLDS, and PULLS

     himself up into the POCKET OF AIR trapped inside the dome.

     THE SUB -- in front of him.  He finds the hatch, opens it, climbs inside

     the sub.

     INT.  SUB

     Norman sits in the small seat.

                         NORMAN

               I'm in.

                    (beat)

               Hello?

     No answer.  He bangs at his helmet... 

                         NORMAN

               Beth?

     He searches the sub's CONTROL PANEL.  Gadgets, switches, buttons.  Up

     top -- a flashing red-lit BUTTON: "TIMER HOLD".  Punches it.  It stops

     flashing, and a small screen glows: "TIMER RESET -- COUNT: 12:00:00".

     It begins counting backwards.

                         NORMAN

               Beth?  Hello?

     No answer.  He looks at the Control Panel:

     A VIDEO SCREEN with the choices: "DESCEND, ASCEND, SECURE,

     SHUTDOWN... "

     THUMP!

     The sub slightly SWAYS.

     Norman sits still, nervous.

     THUMP!  Harder this time.

     Norman looks through the GLASS WINDSHIELD.  Sweating.  Can't see

     anything in here.

     BANG!  It SWAYS faster, harder, back and forth.  He grips the seat.

                         NORMAN

               Beth!  Beth!  There's something -- !

     THUMP!  BANG!  He's thrown around in the sub.  He can't see anything,

     tosses around.  He reaches for the doorhandle.

     BANG!  He looses grip, his legs fly up in the air.  The Sub almost turns

     over on it's side.

                         NORMAN

               Beth!  Shit!

     His HELMET BANGS into the glass, WE SEE his look of terror.  Water

     SPLASHING up from below.

     Then, EVERYTHING stops.

     The sub SWAYS to a still.  He sits quietly.  Waiting.  Listening.

     Reaches for the doorhandle, cautiously climbs out.

     Stands on top of the sub.  Keeping balance.  He looks around, finds a

     DOOR inside the dome.  Tries to open it.  Locked.

     Looks around.  Nothing else.  Looks down at the water.  Can he risk it?

     His BREATHING short.

                         NORMAN

               Beth?  Can you hear me?

     No reply.  He dips his leg slowly, quietly into the water.  Grimacing.

     Then, cautiously slips down into the water... 

     EXT.  UNDERWATER

     CLOSE ON HIS FACE -- terrified.  Looking everywhere.  Searching.  Doesn't

     see anything.  Lands on the bottom.

     His LIFE SUPPORT BADGE beeping.  Shortness of BREATH.

     He walks, trying to run, out from under the dome hanger.  The DARK

     WATER.  Can't see anything.  Scared to death.

                         NORMAN

               Beth?  Beth?  Shit.

     THE HABITAT -- ahead of him.

     Norman goes to a STANCHION.  Grips onto it.  Twists around.  Looking.

     Searching.  Doesn't see anything.  LIFE SUPPORT BADGE bleeping faster.

     Barely BREATHING.

                         HARRY (O.S.)

               ... you there?  Norman?

                         NORMAN

               Harry?

                         HARRY (O.S.)

               Norman, where are you?

                         NORMAN

               I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?

                         HARRY (O.S.)

               You're clear.  You see the airlock?

     Norman, twists around, and as he does... 

     A SEA SNAKE

     HISSES at his faceplate.  Norman SCREAMS.

     ON HIS HAND -- holding the snake, not the girder, lets go.

                         HARRY (O.S.)

               Norman!

     Norman falls... looking up: The SNAKE wrapped around the STANCHION,

     slithering between the grid-like posts.

     THE SNAKE'S HEAD comes at Norman, as he falls to the ocean bottom.

     Backpeddaling on his arms and feet.  THE SNAKE, HISSING, coming at him.

     It's long TONGUE flicking at him, inches from his faceplate.  Norman

     backpeddaling, can't BREATHE, the SNAKE coming down on him, Norman

     falls on his back, the TONGUE WHIPPING across his faceplate, when... 

     NORMAN is whisked up.

     HARRY has him by the collar of his suit.  Taking him up.

     INT.  AIRLOCK

     They burst out of the water.  Harry throws Norman onto the floor.

     Unhooks his helmet -- Norman BREATHES, fast and furious.

     INT.  CORRIDOR

     Norman, panting, walks with Harry... 

                         NORMAN

               Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she

               fixed it --

                         HARRY

               What happened to her?

                         NORMAN

               What do you mean?  She's not here?

                         HARRY

               When I woke up, nobody was here.

                         NORMAN

               She was supposed to be watching the

               sensor for me.

                         HARRY

               Her suit's gone.

                         NORMAN

               Beth left?

                         HARRY

               I thought she was with you.

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

     Norman and Harry at the mic... 

                         BETH (O.S.)

               ... what do you mean?  I'm in the

               ship.

                         NORMAN

               What are you doing in the ship?

                    (beat)

               Beth?

                         BETH (O.S.)

               Getting food.  We were out of food.

               what's wrong?  You sound mad.

                         NORMAN

               Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm

               facing death and someone deserts me.

                         BETH (O.S.)

               Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take

               over for me.

                         NORMAN

               He what?

     Harry shakes his head: "no way".

                         BETH (O.S.)

               When he woke up, he said we were out

               of food.  He told me to get some from

               the ship.

                         HARRY

               I never said that.

                         BETH (O.S.)

               Yes you did.  Norman, I wouldn't

               leave you out there.  You know that.

                         HARRY

               We never even had a conversation,

               Norman.

                         BETH (O.S.)

               Harry?  That's bullshit.  We stood

               right there --

     Harry covers the mic... 

                         HARRY

               She's cracking, Norman.

                         NORMAN

               You didn't say that about the food?

                         HARRY

               I was just in the cafeteria, there's

               plenty of food in there.  Take a look

               for yourself.

                         NORMAN

               But why would she -- ?

                         HARRY

               She's lying, Norman.  Just like she

               lied about fixing your suit.

     Harry uncovers the mic... 

                         BETH (O.S.)

               You get it straightened out?

                         NORMAN

               I think so, Beth.  Yes.

     INT.  CAFETERIA

     Norman, sitting at a table, eating a couple pieces of cold chicken.

     A salad, some fruit, and boxes of crackers on the table.

     Beth walks in, carrying a bag of food.

                         BETH

               What's Harry doing with your suit in

               there?

                         NORMAN

               Fixing it.

                         BETH

               Fixing it?  But I fixed --

                    (notices the food)

               Where'd you get all that?

                         NORMAN

               The refridgerator.

                         BETH

               The refridgerator.

                         NORMAN	

               It's a pretty common place to look

               for food when you don't think you

               have any.

                         BETH

               That wasn't in there before.

                         NORMAN

               We must've had it delivered then.

                         BETH

               Wait a second --

                         NORMAN

               1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear

               they're good.

                         BETH

               None of this was here before.

                         NORMAN

               Did you look?  It was on the top

               shelf.

                         BETH

               No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this

               was here.  None of it.

                    (beat)

               You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He

               must've hid it.

                         NORMAN

               You think?

                         BETH

               You don't believe me.

                         NORMAN

               All I know is I opened that

               refridgerator --

                         BETH

               Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a

               whole conversation with the man when

               he woke up.

                         NORMAN

               This being after you so carefully

               fixed my suit.

                         BETH

               You think it's me?  You think I'm

               saying there was a conversation when

               there wasn't?

                         NORMAN

               I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.

                         BETH

               Damn it, Norman!  He's lying.  Don't

               you get it?  There is something

               seriously fucked up going on here --

               and he's causing it.  Why can't you

               believe me?

     TO HER LEFT -- she looks -- HARRY is standing in a doorway, cold,

     holding Norman's jumpsuit.  He turns away.

     ON BETH -- looking back at Norman, tears rolling down her eyes.

     Harry neatly hangs Norman's jumpsuit under the hook labled: "JOHNSON".

     Smoothens it out for him.

     INT.  CAFETERIA

     ON BETH -- sitting at a table, her face in her hands.

     ON NORMAN -- looking at her, as he closes a box of crackers.  Wraps

     cellophane over the chicken.  Walks with it over to the refridgerator.

     Opens it, placing the chicken inside... but he can't.

     INSIDE THE REFRIDGERATOR

     are BOOKS -- neatly lined up on each of the shelves.

     NORMAN -- backs away.  What the hell?

     Norman now looks at the CUPBOARDS.  Goes to them.

     INSIDE THE CUPBOARD

     Books, neatly stacked.

     Norman, panicking, opens each of the cupboards, all of them with

     BOOKS.

     All of the books are the same.  Entitled: "20,000 Leagues Under The Sea

     by Jules Verne."

     Norman looks over at Beth.

                         BETH

               What is it, Norman?  Norman?

     She comes to him.  He stands there, bewildered, scared, mind racing.

                         BETH

               Norman?

     Norman paces, frantic almost, running his hands through his hair,

     trying to think.  Stops.  Turns to Beth.

                         NORMAN

               Page 87.

                         BETH

               What?

                         NORMAN

               Page 87.  "I could never read that

               far."

     Norman quickly plucks a book from a shelf, turns pages, gets to page

     87.  Reads... 

                         NORMAN

               "Our fisherman frequently see some

               that are more than four feet long.

               Some skeletons of squids... 

                         BETH

               Squids?

               animals, only six feet long, would

               have tentacles 27 feet long.  That

               would make a formidable monster."

     He looks up from the book, realizing something... 

                         BETH

               Norman?

     SNAPS the book closed.

     Norman grabs Harry's YELLOW PAD OF PAPER.

     THEIR FEET -- scurrying through the water soaked corridor.

     Norman ushers her into the Control Room.  Looks around.  SHUTS the door.

     INT.  CONTROL ROOM

     Norman SCRIBBLES on the printout, glancing at the yellow pad of

     paper... 

                         NORMAN

               After the attack, a Navy guy woke me

               up -- I don't know -- I thought he

               was an illusion.  But I checked the

               tape, and Jerry said he manifested

               him.

                         BETH

               Manifested?

                         NORMAN

               Created.  Brought to life.  I don't

               know.  But at the end, Jerry said,

               "Stop calling me Jerry".  And --

     Norman stops, staring at the pad.

                         NORMAN

               He translated it wrong.

                         BETH

               What?

     Norman picks up the pad of paper, reads... 

                         NORMAN

               Hello.  How are you?  I am fine.  What

               is your name?...  

My name is Harry

.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  CORRIDOR

     Harry is walking towards the Living Quarters... 

                         NORMAN (O.S.)

               Remember when we first spoke to

               Jerry, Barnes kept asking for

               Jerry's real name?  But Harry never

               would?  He didn't because he was

               afraid the screen would say "Harry",

               instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking

               to an alien intelligence when we

               talked to Jerry, we were talking to

               Harry... or a part of Harry.

                         BETH (O.S.)

               What do you mean, a part of Harry?

     BACK IN -- CONTROL ROOM

                         NORMAN

               When did the messages start?  The

               animals outside start showing up?

               After Harry came out of the sphere.

                         BETH

               You think, in the sphere --

                         NORMAN

               He acquired some sort of power.  A

               power to manifest things.

                         BETH

               But how?

                         NORMAN

               I don't know.

                         BETH

               How can the sphere do that?

                         NORMAN

               I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the

               fucking alien that built the thing.

               But it can.  When Harry came out of

               the sphere, he mumbled something

               about page 87.  How he would never

               read that far -- he was too scared

               to.  Then you found the book,

               remember in your lab.  Then in the

               cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about

               a giant squid... 

                         BETH

               Which I told Barnes was attacking --

                         NORMAN

               It's his fear.  The squid.  He's

               manifesting his fears.  Making them

               real.

                         BETH

               But why is he doing it?

                         NORMAN

               He must not realize he is.  Like the

               Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping

               then.  He must've manifested his

               dream.

                         BETH

               His dream?  You can't control your

               dreams.  And you can't control your

               fears, can you?

                         NORMAN

                    (shaking his head)

               No.  I mean, we've always believed we

               can think anything we want without

               consequences.  You ever read the

               Bible?

                    (off her look)

               It talks about our sinful nature,

               you know?  I mean, we can think, and

               believe, and desire whatever we

               want, but there's a part of us -- a

               shadow side, as Jung called it --

               that can't be controlled.  It's evil.

               It's inside us.  It's what we are.

                                                            CUT TO:

     IN -- THE LIVING QUARTERS

     It's dark.  Harry lies on his bunk, asleep.

                         BETH (O.S.)

               And that's the part of Harry that's

               being manifested.

                         NORMAN (O.S.)

               Must be.  And if it is -- it's a part

               of him not even he can control.

     Harry opens his eyes, stares at us.

     WE BEGIN TO HEAR A LOW INSISTENT BEEPING... 

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

     ON SCREEN -- a transmission comes across... 

     "CQX VDX MOP LKI... "

     Beth and Norman watch... 

                         NORMAN

               Looks like some sort of code.

                         BETH

               Why would Harry go back to using a

               code?

                         HARRY (O.S.)

               You mean Jerry, don't you?

     Harry leaning against the doorframe, enters the room.

                         BETH

               Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't

               I?

                         HARRY

               That's a hell of a mistake to make,

               Beth.

                         BETH

               I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.

                         HARRY

               Yeah, I don't know how you could

               make that confusion.

     Norman watching them... 

                         HARRY

               Wisconsin's your answer.

                         NORMAN

               Wisconsin?

               Wisconsin.

                         NORMAN

               How do we decode it?

                         HARRY

               Don't have to.  Watch.  It'll do it

               for you.

     THE SCREEN -- jumbling it's letters until finally... 

     "SURFACE SUPPORT VESSELS TO YOUR LOCATION ETA: 1600 HOURS.  END."

     Norman and Beth smile... 

                         NORMAN

               The cavalry is on it's way.

     THE SCREEN -- "16:00:00"... it begins decending in count.

                         BETH

               Just in time, too.

                         HARRY

               In time for what?

                         BETH

               What?

                         HARRY

               Just in time for what?

     Beth, nervous, tries to cover... 

                         BETH

               Our habitat, I mean.  This place

               can't handle another attack.

                         HARRY

               Another attack?

     A long beat, as Beth stares at Harry.

                         HARRY

               Why are you looking at me like that?

                         BETH

               Like what?  I'm not --

                         HARRY

               You're staring at me.

                         BETH

               No I'm not.  I'm not star--

                         HARRY

               Yes you are... 

     Harry looks at both of them, suspiciously... 

                         HARRY

               Did I miss something?  You two seemed

               to patch things up awfully fast.

     A tense beat.

                         NORMAN

               We just figured, you know, the three

               of us -- we need to... work together

               through this.

                         HARRY

               The three of us.

                         NORMAN

               That's right.

                         HARRY

                    (beat)

               Is that why the two of you went

               through my dufflebag?

     Norman glances at THE SCREEN behind Harry: "I WILL KILL YOU ALL."

     INT.  LABRATORY

               Diphenyl parlene.

                         BETH (O.S.)

               Something for burns.

                         NORMAN

               Ephedrine hydrochloride.

     Beth at the computer, looking up the names... 

                         BETH

               It's for motion sickness.

                         NORMAN

               Valdomet.

                         BETH

               Sintag.

                         BETH

               A synthetic opium analogue.

                         NORMAN

               Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all

               we need.  To get him unconscious --

               put him under.

                         BETH

               Nothing about drowsiness.

                         NORMAN

               Tarazine?

                         BETH

               Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.

     Beth goes to the cabinet, grabs another medicine.  Norman comes over as

     Norman comes in... 

                         NORMAN

               He's got Farrakahn's army standing

               guard.  What's plan B?

     Suddenly, BANG!  The room shakes.  Shelves fall.  Cabinet doors swing

     open.  Norman falls to the floor.

     THE COMPUTER MONITOR -- crashes down in front of his face.  It reads: "I

     WILL KILL YOU ALL"

     INT.  CORRIDOR

     Norman and Beth running... 

                         BETH

               Harry!

     BANG!  Water shoots through the wall.  Gushing out onto the floor.  The

     walls CRACKING.

     ON HARRY -- running out of his room... 

                         HARRY

               What is it?

                         NORMAN

               You know what it is, Harry.

     BANG!  They lose their balance, still running... 

                         NORMAN

               It's the squid!  Stop it!

                         HARRY

               Stop what?  What are you -- ?

     BANG!  Another CRACK -- water gushing inside.

                         NORMAN

               You know damn well what.  You're

               doing it!

     Norman grabs Harry, pushes him up against the wall.

                         HARRY

               Doing what?  I'm not doing

               anything -- !

     Beth takes the syringe from her palm, and STABS Harry in the SHOULDER.

     HE SCREAMS IN HORRIFYING PAIN, FADING OVER INTO... 

     INT.  ANOTHER CORRIDOR

     Quiet now.

     INT.  CAFETERIA

     Norman and Beth sit at a table, sipping coffee.

                         NORMAN

               I'm sorry.

                         BETH

               For what?

                         NORMAN

               Not believing you.

                         BETH

               You're not sorry.  You're scared.

                    (beat)

               You're a psychologist, Norman.  You

               pride yourself on knowing when

               someone's lying to you, not telling

               you the truth.  And now you're scared

               ... because you're not sure you can

               tell anymore.

     ON NORMAN -- watching her, sizing her up.

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM -- LATER

     ON HARRY -- lying on a STRETCHER in the corner, propped up with pillows

     and a blanket.  An IV in his arm.

     NORMAN -- at the console, stares at the MONITOR of the SPHERE.  A long

     beat.  His reflection staring back at him.  He slips on the headset... 

                         NORMAN

               Beth?

     INT.  LIVING QUARTERS

     The room is empty.

                         NORMAN (O.S.)

               Beth?

     INT.  CORRIDOR

     Empty.

                         NORMAN (O.S.)

               Can you copy?

     INT.  AIRLOCK

     ON THE JUMPSUIT HANGERS -- the jumpsuit under the name "DR. BETH

     HALPERIN" is missing.

                         NORMAN (O.S.)

               Beth?

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

     Norman at the mic... 

                         BETH (O.S.)

               What is it, Norman?

                         NORMAN

               Where are you?

                         BETH (O.S.)

               In the sub.  Resetting the timer.

               Why?

     ON THE MONITOR -- Beth sitting in the sub.

                         NORMAN

               The sphere looks different.

                         BETH (O.S.)

               What do you mean, different?

                         NORMAN

               The grooves around the door --

               they've shifted.  And the pattern --

               the fluids -- they look darker now.

                         BETH (O.S.)

                    (beat)

               How's Harry?

     ON HARRY -- the IV in his arm.

                         NORMAN

               He's fine.

                                                            CUT TO:

     CLOSE ON A MONITOR: "12:30:00"... descending in count.

     INT.  CAFETERIA

     Norman pouring himself more coffee, alone.

     INT.  AIRLOCK

     Beth's suit still gone.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

     Harry lying on the stretcher, still.

     Norman watching him from above, sipping his coffee.

     HEARS A SOFT BEEPING

     Norman goes to the console, sits.  Checks the monitors.  Looks around

     the console, not knowing what it is.

     A FLASHING LIGHT on the Sensor Board.  Norman still doesn't know what

     it means.

     THE MONITORS go blank.

                         NORMAN

               Beth --

     The MONITORS flash up: "I AM COMING."

     Norman spins around, goes to HARRY -- lying still.  Norman grabs

     Harry's wrist.  Checking pulse.

     Norman returns to the console, slips on the headset... 

                         NORMAN

               Beth?  Beth?  Can you hear me?  Get the

               hell out of there.

     THE MONITORS boot up again.  Norman looks at the SUB VIDEO MONITOR --

     the sub is gone from under the dome.

                         NORMAN

               Beth?

                    (beat)

               Beth?  Shit.

     No reply.  MORE BEEPING.  Panicking.  Bangs on the headset.

                         NORMAN

               Beth?  I'm getting some sort of

               reading.  There's something --

     He scans the MONITORS, looking for movement.  Anything.  They are all

     still.

     Norman turns to looks at Harry... 

     CLOSE ON HARRY'S FACE -- still.

     BACK ON -- NORMAN, sweating... 

                         NORMAN

               And whatever it is, it's not coming

               from Harry.

     Norman looks at the monitors:

     ON AN OUTSIDE CAMERA FEED -- a bright LIGHT blinds the SCREEN.  It's

     Beth in the sub, moving along the habitat.

     The Sub's CLAW ARMS carry large RED BOXES.  The lettering on the boxes

     isn't in focus.

     Norman squints at the MONITOR -- can't make it out.

                         NORMAN

               Beth?  What is that?  What are you

               doing?

     The Sub's CLAW ARMS drops one of the BOXES, plumping it softly on the

     muddy floor.

                         NORMAN

               Can you hear me?  Beth?  Can you copy?

               Get inside, there's something out

               there.

     ON ANOTHER MONITOR -- the Sub moves forward.  Churning up the sediment.

     It stops again, and releases another box.

     Norman BANGS on the headset.

                         NORMAN

               Damn it, Beth, I know you hear me.

     THE MONITORS blink: "I AM COMING FOR YOU"

     ON NORMAN -- breathing heavy.

                         NORMAN

               What the hell?

     ANOTHER MONITOR -- the Sub in view -- a closer view.  It releases it's

     last box.  Norman can read the lettering now: "CAUTION: TEVAC

     EXPLOSIVES"

                         NORMAN

               Beth?  C'mon.  What are you -- ?

     THE MONITORS flash: "I WILL KILL YOU"

                         NORMAN

               Oh shit.

     Norman WHIPS off his headset, bursts out of his seat, OPENS a CABINET.

     Searching for tapes.  Another cabinet.  Then another.

     A shelf labled: "SPHERE" -- all the tapes are gone.

                         NORMAN

               It's her.

     THE MONITORS flash: "I WILL KILL YOU"

     ON THE HEADSET -- resting on the console.  WE HEAR faintly... 

                         BETH (O.S.)

               Norman?  Norman?

     INT.  CORRIDOR

     Norman pushes Harry and his IV down the corridor.  Hurrying.  An inch or

     two of water on the floor.

     INT.  LIVING QUARTERS

     CLOSE ON A METAL CASE -- labled: "Captain Harold Barnes."

     Norman BANGS it against the wall, trying to bust the LOCK.  BANGING.

     BANGING.  Breaks the lock.  Digs inside the case.

     Pulls out a GUN.

     INT.  ANOTHER CORRIDOR

     Norman pushing Harry and the IV stand.  Wheels him into... 

     BATHROOM/SINK AREA

     Norman stops.  Turns off the main lights.  The room goes dark.  The

     florescent LIGHT above the sinks stay on.

     Norman wheels Harry inside, places him by a wall.  Checks the IV.

     Norman goes to a STALL.  Steps inside.  Keeps the stall door open.  Can

     still see Harry about 10 feet away.

     Norman looks at the GUN.  COCKS it.  Pinches his finger.

                         NORMAN

               Ouch.

     He waits.  Listening.

     A FAINT HIGH-PITCHED HISSING SOUND

     Norman looks over at the sinks.

     A FAUCET is on.  Water HISSING faintly from it.

     Norman ignores it.  Waiting in the dark.  Listening.

     ON THE FAUCET -- the water running.

     ON NORMAN -- looking at it.  Can't ignore it.  Tries.  But can't.

     Norman walks quietly through the inch of water on the floor.

     OVER TO THE SINKS

     The light above them on.  Norman turns the faucet off.  The water stops.

     But the HISSING SOUND remains.

     Norman looks at the faucet, queerly.  Turns it back on.  Then off.

     The HISSING SOUND still there.  It isn't the water.

     Norman looks down at his feet... 

     THE FLOOR -- seems to be moving.  Something swimming in the water.

     CLOSE ON NORMAN'S PANTLEG -- a long, tubular SEA SNAKE slithers up

     inside his pantleg, HISSING.  His pants BULGING as the SNAKE slowly

     slides up past his knee.

     HISSING LOUDER

     As more SNAKES comes through the crack in the wall.

     NORMAN watches with horror in the mirror in front of him as the SNAKE

     slithers up to his groin, and across the inside of his shirt.

     Another SNAKE begins WRAPPING itself around the outside of Norman,

     sliding up around his neck.

     WE HEAR FOOTSTEPS COME FROM DOWN THE HALL

     NORMAN, standing still, watches as more SNAKES crawl up his sides,

     slithering around his arms, his shoulders, his neck, under his chin,

     over his face.  Their forked tongues FLICKING and HISSING.

                         BETH (O.S.)

               What time is it, Norman?

     NORMAN looking in the MIRROR -- as Beth comes up behind him in her

     jumpsuit.

                         BETH

               Do you know the time?

     Norman GLARES at her in the mirror.  His body STIFF.

                         BETH

               I have to know the time of day,

               Norman.  Do you know?

     SNAKES covering his eyes, SLITHERING across his mouth.

                         NORMAN

                    (through his teeth)

               Your watch.

     A SNAKE flicking it's tongue at Norman's lips.  Trying to get inside

     his mouth.

                         BETH

               What was that?  I couldn't hear you.

                         NORMAN

               Your watch.

                         BETH

               Oh yes, my watch.  I almost forgot.

     She looks at her watch.

                         BETH

               Splendid.

     She begins grabbing the SNAKES off of him, carefully dropping them to

     the ground.  SNAKES writhing in her hands, twisted around her wrists.

     Shakes them off.  Some drop in the sink.  She bends out of view -- and

     the SNAKE inside Norman's shirt, MOVES back down the way it came.

     Past his stomach, his groin.

     Norman HEAVES from his chest, VOMITS on the mirror... 

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  CAFETERIA

     CLOSE ON A POT -- pouring a white, milkish DRINK into a cup.

     Beth walks it over to Norman, sitting at a table, looking ill.

                         BETH

               Isotonic glucose supplement.

     Norman looks at the cup.

                         BETH

               Go ahead, drink it.

     Norman places the cup down.

                         BETH

               What's wrong, Norman?

                         NORMAN

               I'm feeling better.

                         BETH

               Are you?

     Beth takes a seat.  Stares at him.  A long beat.

                         BETH

               It's getting cold.

                         NORMAN

               You think I'd really drink that?

                         BETH

               You don't think I put something in

               it, do you?

                         NORMAN

               You put explosives around the

               habitat, I can't imagine what you'd

               put in a drink.

                         BETH

               I did do that, didn't I?

     A beat.  She picks up the drink, and begins sipping it.  Norman watches

     her.

                         NORMAN

               How do you feel about snakes?

                         BETH

               Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?

                         NORMAN

               You know what I mean.

                         BETH

               Am I afraid of them?  Not during the

               day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When

               the sun's out, they don't bite.

               Fortunately for you, I had on my

               watch.

                    (off cup)

               This is quite good.

                         NORMAN

               What are they doing down here?  In

               the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.

                         BETH

               You tell me.

                         NORMAN

               Do you fear them?

                         BETH

               Don't you?

                         NORMAN

               Are you manifesting them?

                         BETH

               If I was, then I would've had to

               have gone in the sphere, wouldn't

               I?

                         NORMAN

               Did you?

                         BETH

               What's the phrase -- "keeping up

               with the Joneses"?

                         NORMAN

               Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?

                         BETH

               Same reason I put explosives around

               the habitat.  For defense.  For the

               power.  To protect myself.

                         NORMAN

               Against what?  Harry's unconscious.

               He's not a threat.

                         BETH

               No, he isn't.

                         NORMAN

               He can't manifest.

                         BETH

               No, he can't.

                         NORMAN

               Then why, Beth?  Why go in?  Why put

               out explosives?  Why manifest the

               snakes?

                         BETH

               You think I manifested the snakes?

                         NORMAN

               Someone did.

                         BETH

               Yes, someone did.  But it wasn't me,

               Norman.

                    (beat)

               It was you.  You manifested the

               snakes.

     A long beat between them.

                         NORMAN

               Beth you're losing it.  C'mon.

                         BETH

               C'mon -- what?

                         NORMAN

               You're lying --

                         BETH

               Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you

               absolutely sure I'm lying?

                    (off his look)

               Then explain to me about the

               jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see

               jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear

               jellyfish.  You do.  They're your

               fear, aren't they?

                         NORMAN

               But --

                         BETH

               And the snakes?  You want to know

               about the snakes?  You saw one

               outside earlier, didn't you?  When

               you thought I had deserted you --

               you were terrified.

                         NORMAN

                    (realizing)

               That's when you went in the sphere.

                         BETH

               One lonely, terrifying sea snake.

                         NORMAN

               You manifested that, Beth.

                         BETH

               Did I?  Or was that you?

                    (beat)

               When you were hiding in the bathroom

               -- all conspiratorially like you were

               -- you became frightened, didn't

               you?  Terrified.  Like you were with

               the snake earlier -- and suddenly

               you have snakes slithering all over

               the floor.  You did that, Norman.

                         NORMAN

               You're insane.

                         BETH

               Am I?  Or am I making so much sense

               that you're going insane?

                         NORMAN

               I never went in that sphere.

                         BETH

               You don't remember you did.  But I'm

               sure you remember running like some

               fucking hero to get Harry, don't

               you?  You remember that.

                         NORMAN

               Yes.

                         BETH

               You remember before you picked him

               up -- when you looked up at the

               sphere, you remember that -- when

               the sphere opened?

                    (off his look)

               That's right.  But you can't remember

               going inside, can you?  No, of course

               not.  Harry couldn't either, could

               he?  "Like everything's on the tip of

               my tongue", he said.

                         NORMAN

               That's bullshit.

                         BETH

               Is it?

                         NORMAN

               Beth, the message said Harry.  "My

               name is Harry".  My name isn't Harry.

                         BETH

               No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman.

               But your younger brother -- what was

               his name?  The one who was stung when

               you were younger.  The one that died.

               The one you couldn't save.  What was

               his name?

                    (imitating)

               "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean

               -- to go swimming." "But I don't

               want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm

               scared." "C'mon, 

Harry

, it'll be

               fine, it'll be fun."

                    (resuming)

               You heartless fuck.  That's why

               you're so scared of the water, isn't

               it?

                         NORMAN

               Shut up, Beth --

                         BETH

               When you were in that sub -- and

               that squid was attacking you -- are

               you sure it was the squid that was

               attacking?  Do you know?  "I can't get

               Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny

               sub on the bottom of the fucking

               ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all

               this water." Was it really the squid

               that was attacking you, Norman -- or

               was it something else -- one of your

               fears?  You never really saw what it

               was, did you?

     Norman stares up at her, frightened.  Is she right?

                         BETH

               I'm not scaring you, am I Norman?  I

               hope I'm not frightening you.  The

               last thing I want to do is frighten

               you.  You feel okay, don't you?

                         NORMAN

               It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't

               be.

                         BETH

               "It's not me, Beth.  It's not me.  It

               can't be.  I'm not doing anything."

               Just like Harry said before I

               stabbed him with the needle.

     Norman looks at her palm -- SEES the NEEDLE in her hand.  Norman backs

     up, away.

                         NORMAN

               Don't, Beth.

                         BETH

               But I have to, Norman.

                         NORMAN

               I promise --

                         BETH

               Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!

                         NORMAN

               Beth --

                         BETH

               You think I'd belive you?  Believe

               anything you might say now?  After

               you lied to me about telling Barnes

               about my past.  About my problems.  My

               problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.

                         NORMAN

               Don't, Beth.  Please.

                         BETH

               It's either this... or I kill you.

     The GUN in her other hand.

                         NORMAN

               Beth --

     She comes at him, needle in hand... 

                         BETH

               It's your choice.  Because it's not

               safe for you to be awake.  To be

               walking around.  To be thinking about

               things.

                         NORMAN

               It's not safe for you to be either.

                         BETH

               You think I care?  You think I care

               if I die?

                    (almost laughing)

               Would I put explosives around the

               habitat -- set on vibration sensors

               -- that can trigger automatically,

               if I cared about myself?  Would I?

               I've tried twice before, Norman, why

               wouldn't I try a third time?  I'm not

               thinking about myself -- No, Norman,

               I'm thinking about you.  Your safety.

               Protecting you from your own self.

     She lunges at him with the needle, missing.  He RUNS for the SPIRAL

     STAIRCASE leading to the lab.  Norman grabs the handrail, begins

     climbing the stairs.

     Beth's at his feet, grabbing for his ankles.

                         BETH

               Norman!  I'm doing this for you,

               Norman.

     He frantically crawls up the stairs, her grasping at his heels.

                         BETH

               Norman.

     Climbing, climbing -- round and round -- the STAIRS never seem to end.

     He looks up:

     THE STAIRS -- expanding in front of him, strangely increasing in

     number.  He climbs, racing, PANTING.  Beth, right behind him, laughing

     almost.

                         BETH

               Come here, Norman.

     She GRABS his ANKLE.  She raises the NEEDLE.  Norman turns, KICKS her in

     the FACE.

     She WAILS, blood SPITTING from her nose.

     Climbing, climbing.  The STAIRS increasing above.  He LUNGES for the top

     step, GRABS it.  Pulls himself up... 

     INTO THE LAB

     Scrambling.  He stares down at Beth -- the GUN pointing at him.

                         BETH

               Norman --

     He SLAMS the HATCH DOOR, on top of her, BASHING her head down.  He

     holds the DOOR closed.  Trying to regain his breath.

                         BETH (O.S.)

               This is what I'm talking about,

               Norman.  Don't you see?  It's in you.

               This vindictiveness.  This rage.

                         NORMAN

               Get away from the door, Beth.

     He slides a heavy FILE CABINET over on top of the door.

                         BETH (O.S.)

               Oh, Norman, I don't want to come

               in... 

     The door's METAL PIVOT turns... 

                                                            CUT TO:

     ON BETH -- on the stairs, spinning the door's WHEEL... 

                         BETH

               ... I want to lock you in.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  LABRATORY

     Norman staring at the wheel.  CLICK!  It's locked from the outside.

     Norman falls to his knees.  PANTING.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  LABRATORY -- LATER

     CLOSE ON A SURVEILLANCE VIDEO CAMERA -- in the upper corner of the

     room.

                         BETH (O.S.)

               You're a psychologist, Norman.  You

               of all people, don't want to admit

               to your shadow side... 

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

     ON A MONITOR -- WE SEE Norman -- sitting in a corner of the lab,

     staring up at US.

                         BETH (O.S.)

               ... You have a professional stake in

               believing in your own mental health,

               don't you?  Don't you, Norman?... 

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  LABRATORY

     Norman, huddled on the floor.

                         BETH (O.S.)

               Of course you're going to deny it.

               You want to blame someone else.  You

               want to blame Beth.  Because you

               hate Beth.

                         NORMAN

               Don't fuck with me, Beth.

                         BETH (O.S.)

               I'm not fucking with you, Norman.

               You've fucked yourself.

     Norman JUMPS up, looks at the ground -- WATER on the floor.  Rising in

     level.

                         NORMAN

               Turn off the water, Beth.

     The entire floor is covered in water, rising higher, and rising fast.

                         NORMAN

               Beth!

                         BETH (O.S.)

               You're frightened, aren't you,

               Norman?

     Norman, WADING through the water, searching... 

                         NORMAN

               Where is it coming from, Beth?

                         BETH (O.S.)

               Don't you know?

     Rising higher... 

                         NORMAN

               Beth, stop it!

                         BETH

               Stop what?  Don't blame me.  It's not

               me.

     Norman frantically checking for a crack, a leak.

                         NORMAN

               Then where's it coming from?

                         BETH (O.S.)

               From you, Norman.  From your mind.

               You're doing it.

     It's up to his waist.  He climbs on top a lab bench.  Puts his hands to

     his temples, straining.  WE HEAR Beth laughing.

     A SPECIMEN BOTTLE -- EXPLODES right next to him.

                         BETH (O.S.)

               There's no ventalation in the room,

               Norman.  The pressure's going to kill

               you.

     Another BOTTLE SHATTERS, shooting fragments of glass across the room.

                         NORMAN

               Stop it!

                         BETH (O.S.)

               It's you, Norman.  Your fear of

               drowning.  You have to face it.

     Microscope lenses CRACK.  Bottles, Test Tubes, Dishes EXPOLDE.

                         BETH (O.S.)

               C'mon, Norman.  Let me put you under.

               Before you kill yourself!

     SHATTER!  CRACK!

     Bottles floating in the water POP!  The water too high -- Norman

     swimming in it now, keeping afloat.  His FACE strains from the

     pressure.  He looks at the CAMERA in the corner... 

                         BETH (O.S.)

               It's over, Norman.

     Next to the CAMERA, he SEES the HATCH DOOR in the ceiling.

                         BETH (O.S.)

               Don't even think it.  You don't have

               your suit, Norman.  The water will

               freeze you.

     He reaches up at the door.  Can't get it.  The water rising.  He DIVES

     down in the water... 

     UNDERWATER

     He swims to a cabinet near the floor, OPENS it, searches, THINGS

     floating out -- AN OXYGEN CYLINDER and MASK -- he GRABS it.

                                                            CUT TO:

     NORMAN'S FACE -- bursts above water level, slips on the mask, BREATHES.

                         BETH (O.S.)

               It won't help, Norman.  Your body is

               boyant.  You're gonna shoot right to

               the surface and explode, Norman.

               Don't you get it?  It's over.

     He BREATHES a last breath, reaches up to the ceiling HATCH DOOR, SPINS

     it.

                         BETH (O.S.)

               Norman, what are you doing!  You're

               insa--

     The DOOR opens and WATER gushes inside.  He grabs the frame of the

     door, and his body shoots up through the hole... 

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT.  OCEAN -- UNDERWATER

     His body upside down, his hand holding onto the frame.  He grabs a PIPE

     next to it, pulls himself hand over hand, along the pipe.

     HIS FACE -- straining from the freezing chill.

     MOVING along the pipe, hand over hand.  He loses grip.  His body thrusts

     upwards.

     CLOSE ON HIS RIGHT HAND -- purple, frozen, holding onto the pipe.

     Barely gripping.

     HIS FACE -- his eyes fluttering.  He blows air from his mouth, BUBBLES

     burst from his lips.

     HIS BODY slightly descending.

     HIS LEFT HAND -- grips the pipe.  He continues on.

     HAND OVER HAND.  Pulling himself... 

     UNDER THE HABITAT

     He SEES the airlock in front of him.

     He SCOOTS along, but slower, now.  He stops.  Can't continue.  He clasps

     his hand to his CHEST, it's burning.  He SEES the airlock.  His eyes

     fluttering, he's losing consciousness.  He can't do it.  And he lets go

     of the pipe.

     FLOATING UPWARDS -- is he gone?

     HIS HEAD -- BANGS into the habitat floor.  His body flat underneath it.

     Being sucked upwards against it.

     He pushes forward... trying to grab the floor with his hands.  He's

     inches from the airlock.

     Plants his feet against the wall -- and pushes forward.  His body

     SUCKED UP and away... 

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  AIRLOCK

     ... His head BURSTS above the water level, BIG BREATH.  GASPING.  He

     flails his arms over to the ladder.  Grips the ladder, but his hands

     are like ice.  Can't hold it.  He slips.

     Flailing in the water.

     He HEAVES his chest over the METAL RIM.  Twists his legs around, out of

     the water, and flops his body onto the deck.

     Shivering.

     Tries to get up.  Falls over.  His body shaking.  His lips purple.  His

     eyes barely open, looking at... 

     HIS JUMPSUIT -- hanging on the wall.

     Norman crawls toward the suit, his body shaking violently.  He reaches

     out for his boots on the floor.  Can't grip them.  Inches his HEAD

     toward his suit, tries to BITE at his suit, but his TEETH chattering.

                         BETH (O.S.)

               I know what you're doing, Norman.

               But you can't save yourself.

     He grips the wall, his hands pulling him up.  He RIPS his suit off the

     hanger.

                         BETH (O.S.)

               It's over, Norman.  It's all over.

     Slipping on his suit, he HEARS a MAN'S voice... 

                         MAN (O.S.)

               Your attention, please.  Your

               attention, please.  All construction

               personnel clear the blast area now.

               Tevac explosives are now activated.

               Countdown beginning.  Mark 15

               minutes, and counting.

     ON NORMAN -- as he slips on his helmet, his teeth -- chattering.

                                                            CUT TO:

     CLOSE ON THE AIRLOCK HATCH DOOR -- Norman trying to open it.

                         BETH (O.S.)

                    (through Norman's

                    helmet)

               Locked.  Don't try, Norman.  You can't

               get in.  I won't let you in.

     Norman turns, dives back in the water.

                                                            CUT TO:

     UNDERWATER

     Norman swims out from under the habitat.  Looks around at the

     cylinders, the walls.

     Goes to the outside of a WALL.  Looking for a CRACK, a LEAK, a way in.

     TO HIS LEFT -- Barnes' body, floating, hooked to the wall.

     Norman goes to him.  SEES the CRACK.

     Climbing inside.  Struggling through the CRACK, careful not to rip his

     suit.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  CORRIDOR

     Flooded to the top with water.  Completely filled.  Norman emerges

     through the crack.  MOVES down the hall.

     A BOX OF CORN FLAKES

     floats by his faceplate.

                         BETH (O.S.)

               Norman, where are you?  I can't see

               you, Norman.  Tell me where you are.

     Norman pulls at the cylinder's HATCH DOOR.  He HEARS faintly through

     his helmet... 

                         MAN (O.S.)

               Twelve minutes, and counting.

     He OPENS the door.  Slips inside, the water going with him.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

     BEEP!  BEEP!  BEEP!

     A SCREEN -- flashes: "D CYLINDER HATCH DOOR -- OPEN"

     The CHAIR in front of the console -- spinning, empty.  Beth just left.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  CORRIDOR

     Norman closes the door.  Runs.  Down the corridor... 

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  BATHROOM-SINK AREA

     Norman ducks inside.

     THE STRETCHER, the IV -- empty.  Harry's not there.

                                                            CUT TO:

               Please evacuate.

                         NORMAN

               Beth?  Can you hear me?

                    (no reply)

               Beth.

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

     Norman runs inside... 

     The chair, stopping it's spin.

     BEEP!  BEEP!  BEEP!

     THE MONITOR -- flashes: "B CYLINDER -- DOOR OPEN".

     Norman's out the door.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  CORRIDOR

     Norman, running.  SEES the B Cylinder door.  Goes to it.  Spins it,

     OPENS.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  B CYLINDER

     Norman climbs inside, takes off his helmet.

     THE CYLINDER -- a maze of pipes and equipment.  Heaters, controls, and

     wires everywhere.  Difficult to see.

     THROUGH PIPES

     WE SEE NORMAN -- walking through the cylinder.  Holding his helmet at

     his hip.

                         NORMAN

               Beth?

                         BETH (O.S.)

               Leave me alone, Norman.

     He goes to her voice in the back.  Past pipes, equipment.

                         NORMAN

               I can't do that.

     ON BETH -- huddled in the back corner, wedged among pipes.  Her eyes

     red.  Holding the GUN in her hand.  Pointing at Norman as he SEES her

     through the pipes.

     ABOVER HER HEAD -- a computer SCREEN, reading: "DETONATION SEQUENCE

     09:32"... descending in count.

     Norman stares up at the SCREEN, concentrating.

                         BETH

               You can't stop it, Norman.  You can't

               fight me.

                         NORMAN

               I know.  You're too strong, Beth.

                         BETH

               Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman.

               Not now.

                         NORMAN

               I --

                         BETH

               Don't tell me about me.  I already

               know too much.

                         NORMAN

               Beth -- gimme the gun.

                         BETH

               Oh, sure.  Here.  Anything else, Beth

               can get you?  Some more chicken,

               perhaps.  Let Beth check the fridge.

                         NORMAN

               C'mon --

                         BETH

               Top shelf, is it?

                         NORMAN

               Let's get out of here, Beth.  Let's

               go home.

     She sees HER REFLECTION on a PIECE of BROKEN GLASS on the floor.  She

     puts her fingers to her matted hair, tries to comb it.

     Over the intercom... 

                         MAN (O.S.)

               Nine minutes, and counting.

                         NORMAN

               C'mon, Beth.

     ON THE GUN -- WE SEE Beth's wrists.  The two scars.

                         BETH

               It's over, Norman.  Go on, get outta

               here.

     Norman walks toward her.  Beth freaks... 

                         BETH

               What is that?  What are you doing?

                         NORMAN

               What?

                         BETH

               You hear that?

                         NORMAN

               Hear what?

                         BETH

               Get away from me!

                         NORMAN

               Beth --

                         BETH

               Get away --

     BAM!  From behind her -- Harry -- WHACKS Beth across the head with a

     WRENCH, sending her to the ground.

     Norman goes to her, checking her pulse.

                         HARRY

               Did I kill her?

                         NORMAN

               I don't think so.

                         HARRY

               I could hit her a little harder.

               More toward the cranium.

     Norman stares at the NUMBERS on the SCREEN above him.

                         HARRY

               If she's still conscious, you can't

               fight her.  You can't stop the

               numbers.

     Over the intercom... 

                         MAN (O.S.)

               Eight minutes and counting.

                         HARRY

               Killing her's the only way --

                         NORMAN

               Hey!  Look!  We didn't kill you,

               alright?  And believe me Harry, I

               would've found great pleasure in

               bashing your head in.

     Norman RIPS off a piece of her t-shirt, ties it to the wound around

     her head.

                         HARRY

               Fine.

                         NORMAN

               Help me lift her.

     INT.  CORRIDOR

     Norman, carrying Beth in his arms, races awkwardly down the hall... 

                         HARRY

               We're never gonna make it.

                         NORMAN

               Shut up and open the door.

     Harry does.

     INT.  AIRLOCK

     Harry, in his suit now, helps Norman slip on Beth's boots and

     jumpsuit.

                         HARRY

               How much time you figure to get to

               the surface?

                         NORMAN

               Two and a half minutes.  Once we're

               in the sub.

                         HARRY

               How far away's the sub?

                         MAN (O.S.)

               Six minutes and counting.

                         NORMAN

               A little less than six minutes.

     EXT.  UNDERWATER

     Norman carrying Beth on his back, hurries through the water.

                         MAN (O.S.)

               Five minutes.  I repeat five minutes

               to detonation.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT.  UNDERWATER

     UNDERNEATH THE SUB'S DOME HANGER

     Norman tries to climb up the ladder with Beth on his back.  She falls

     off, deadweight to the ground.

                         NORMAN

               Shit.

                    (picking her up)

               Harry!  I'm gonna have to lift her up

               to you.

     Harry leans down from the Sub's airlock... 

                         HARRY

               Alright.  Hurry.

     Norman pushes her up to him, but she bends at the waist.

                         HARRY

               I can't reach her.

                         NORMAN

               Hold on.

     Norman flops her up in the air, but she bends again at the waist.

                         HARRY

               Push her, c'mon.

                         NORMAN

               I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her.

     He flops her up again.

                         HARRY

               Missed.

                         NORMAN

               Are you trying, damn it?  Just --

                         MAN (O.S.)

               Four minutes and counting.

     Norman loses grip, drops her.

                         NORMAN

               Hold on.

                         HARRY

               Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.

                         NORMAN

               I heard!  I heard!

     Picking her up... 

                         HARRY

               Three fifty-six, three fifty-five,

               three --

                         NORMAN

               Shut up and catch.

     Norman flops her up once more, and Harry grabs her AIR HOSE.

                         HARRY

               I got her.  I got her.

     Harry pulls her toward the airlock, Norman climbs up after.

     INT.  SUB AIRLOCK

     The pocket of air around the sub.  The three of them crammed inside.

     Norman opens the door on top of the sub.

                         NORMAN

               Alright, here, I'll... wait, you --

               just give her to me.

     Norman takes Beth and pushes her on top the sub.  The sub sways back

     and forth.

                         HARRY

               Norman, what are you --

     They lose balance, Beth almost falls, Norman catches her.

                         NORMAN

               Shit.  Alright, Harry, get in there.

     Harry jumps on top of the sub.  Slides inside it.  Reaches his arms out,

     catching Beth's legs.

                         MAN (O.S.)

               Three minutes and counting... 

                         NORMAN

               Take her, come on.  Just --

     Beth's LEG swings up and hits Harry in the helmet.

                         HARRY

               C'mon, Norman!

                         NORMAN

               I'm trying to keep balance with --

                         HARRY

               Gimme a second --

                         NORMAN

               Just pull her -- down like inside --

               Harry, work with me here!

                         HARRY

               Her legs are in the way.

                         NORMAN

               You got her?

     Harry pulls Beth down inside, as Norman steps on top of the sub, helps

     push Beth's head inside.

                         NORMAN

               Get her out of the seat, I need room

               to sit.  Harry?

                         HARRY

               I'm trying.  There.

                         MAN (O.S.)

               Two minutes-thirty and counting.

     Norman drops inside.

     INT.  SUB

     Norman in the seat.  Beth's leg hangs over his right shoulder.  Harry

     looks at Norman who assesses the flight controls.

                         HARRY

               You know how to work this thing?

                         NORMAN

               No idea.

                         HARRY

               Well, press something!

                         NORMAN

               Wait!

                         MAN (O.S.)

               Two minutes and counting.

                         HARRY

               How long did you say --

                         NORMAN

               Shut up.  Let me think.

     Norman presses a button.

     THE SCREEN -- blinks: "DESCEND, ASCEND, SECURE, SHUTDOWN... "

     Norman hits "ASCEND".  The Sub WHIRRS, RUMBLES and drops down below.

     Norman works the steering wheel, gliding it upwards.

     EXT.  UNDERWATER

     The SUB comes out from under the dome.  Rising above the habitat... 

                         HARRY

               Less than a minute, we're never

               gonna make it.

                         NORMAN

               Nine hundred feet to surface.

                         HARRY

               It's not fast enough, Norman.

               There's a helluva lot of explosive

               down there.

     EXT.  UNDERWATER

     The sub ascends past the spacecraft tail fin.

     INT.  SUB

     Harry looking down below him... 

                         MAN (O.S.)

               Thirty seconds to detonation.

                         HARRY

               The shock wave's gonna crush us,

               Norman.

                         NORMAN

               Maybe.  Brace yourself.

     Harry just stares at Norman.  Norman grabs Beth, trying to stablilize

     her.

                         HARRY

                    (off Norman's suit)

               How's that working out, by the way?

                         NORMAN

               Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it

               on.

                    (Harry laughs)

               Why are you laughing?  You don't even

               know what that means.

                         HARRY

               No.  I don't.  But I always said to

               myself, when I die, I want to die

               laughing.

     Harry laughs.

     Ascending... waiting... and then... 

     A THUNDEROUS EXPLOSION below them... 

     Rocking the sub, spinning it up and around, surging it upwards to the

     surface.

     THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD -- RACING toward the surface, toward the

     SUNLIGHT -- it's BLINDING -- and the screen GOES WHITE.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  DECOMPRESSION ROOM

     A pale, white room.

     ON NORMAN -- sleeping.  His eyes begin to open.  He awakes.

     BETH -- is next to him, looking at him.  There is a long beat.

                         BETH

               Thank you.

     Norman looks up at her... 

                         NORMAN

               You know, I think you really need to

               see a psychologist.

     She stares back at him, and smiles.  Begins laughing with him.

     EXT.  DECOMPRESSION CHAMBER

     TWO NAVY CREWMEN stand outside the door, looking in.

                         CREWMAN #1

               Has anyone spoken to them yet?

                         CREWMAN #2

                    (shakes his head)

               The Admiral's going over the tapes

               they brought up now.

                         CREWMAN #1

               Does he know yet what really

               happened down there?

     Looking INSIDE -- Norman, Harry, and Beth sit at a table.

     INT.  DECOMPRESSION CHAMBER

     At the table... 

                         HARRY

               They're going to want answers and

               they're going to keep asking until

               they get them.

                         BETH

               We can refuse to talk.

                         HARRY

               Won't make any difference.  The tapes

               document everything.

     A long beat.

                         NORMAN

               There is one possibility.

                         HARRY

               We all kill ourselves?

                    (laughing, then)

               Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.

     She smiles.

                         NORMAN

               The power allows us to manifest our

               fears, right?  What if we feared the

               power to go away?

                         HARRY

               You mean forget?

                         NORMAN

               It would erase all our knowledge of

               it.  All of our power.

                         BETH

               Would it work?

                         NORMAN

               Yes.  And I think we already know it

               will.

                         BETH

               How's that?

                         NORMAN

               Down below, Harry said we would all

               have to die.  Since there was no

               evidence on that spacecraft that

               anybody knew time travel through a

               black hole was possible -- and we

               all knew -- then we would all have

               to die before we could tell anyone.

               Death was the only logical

               explanation.  But sitting here, we

               still know.  So how is that possible?

                    (beat)

               Unless we make ourselves forget.

     INT.  SHIP'S HALLWAY -- LATER

     Norman, Harry, and Beth walk with the CREWMEN.

     INT.  ADMIRAL'S OFFICE

     The ADMIRAL, 60s, many stripes on his sleeves, sits behind his desk.

     Harry and Beth sit in front of him.  The TAPES on the desk.

                         ADMIRAL

               There are some questions that we

               need to address here.

                         HARRY

               What about?

                         ADMIRAL

               When you were being transferred to

               decompression, Dr. Adams, you

               mentioned something about a squid.

                         HARRY

               A what?

                         ADMIRAL

               A squid.  However, there doesn't seem

               to be any squid recorded on these

               tapes.

                         BETH

               A squid?  I don't remember anything

               about a squid.

                    (to Harry)

               Did you say something about a squid,

               Harry?

     Harry shakes his head.

     EXT.  SHIP DECK -- DAY

     A bright, sunny day.

     ON THE HELIPAD -- the helicopter's propeller begins whirling.

     INT.  HELICOPTER

     An OFFICER sits in the passenger's seat, glancing at a clipboard.

                         OFFICER

               You all ready to go, Dr... ?

     The PILOT from the opening scene... 

                         PILOT

               Johnson.  The psychologist.  The one

               that wrote the report.

     ON NORMAN -- in the back.

                         NORMAN

               What report?

                                                            CUT TO:

     BLACK.
