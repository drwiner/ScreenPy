   FROM ANDREW'S FIRST CAMERA.

   CUT - to indicate time lapses within a scene

   INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREW'S ROOM

   The room is dingy. Unkempt. The camera sits on the bed, on

   its side, facing the door. We can hear someone moving around

   off screen.

   The door handle clicks; someone's trying it.    Then nothing.

   Then, suddenly, loud pounding on the door.

   Andrew's voice is scratchy and prone to cracking.   He speaks

   with a rushed mix of fear and anxiety.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          What do you want, I'm getting ready

          for school-

                    MR. DETMER (O.S.)

          Why is the door locked, unlock this

          fucking door right now.

   The bed stirs as Andrew sits down.

                    MR. DETMER (O.S.) (CONT'D)

          I said unlock this door. UNLOCK

          THE DOOR. OPEN THE DOOR, NOW.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          You're drunk-

                     MR. DETMER (O.S.)

          Listen, you don't tell me- IF I'M

          DRUNK, OR-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          It's seven thirty. In the AM.

          You're drunk, dad, that's crazy-

                    MR. DETMER (O.S.)

          What're you doing in there.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          I'm filming this.

                    MR. DETMER (O.S.)

          What?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          I bought a camera. I'm filming all

          your shit from now on.

                                                         2.

   There's a beat, and then we can hear Mr. Detmer moving away

   from the door.

   INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - SANDRA DETMER'S ROOM

   Equally dingy. SANDRA DETMER, gaunt and sickly, is sat up in

   bed. Andrew's filming her. She's clearly very ill, speaking

   in a weak rasp. Andrew now holds the camera.

                   ANDREW (O.S.)

          Mom? Will you say hi to the

          camera?

                    SANDRA DETMER

          Who's the audience?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          The millions of people watching at

          home.

                    SANDRA DETMER

          Hello world. Do I look awful?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          No, you look great.

                    SANDRA DETMER

          I've been looking a little better,

          yeah?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Oh yeah, definitely.

                    SANDRA DETMER

          It's a nice camera.

   EXT. CLARK STREET - MORNING

   Clark Street is a slummy mess; dead lawns, potholes in the

   street in a downtrodden suburb of Portland Oregon. Andrew

   carries the camera loosely at his side before getting into

   the passenger side of a car.

   In the driver's seat is MATT Garrety, 17, with messy hair.

   He's disaffected, and more than a little cynical; the

   reasoned demeanor of an unpretentious high-school

   intellectual.

                    MATT

          I got you egg salad.

                                                    3.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Oh, yeah, thanks.

                                                 CUT.

  They're driving.

                    MATT

          So...Should I ask about the camera,

          or-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          I'm filming things now. I'm

          filming everything.

                    MATT

          You're filming everything.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          For my mom. I'm trying to get

          custody of her from my dad. She's

          getting worse, and he's

          not...helping, and this way, in

          case something goes down-

                    MATT

          He gets violent or whatever-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Right, it'd be evidence.

                    MATT

          Evidence. But you're not with him

          right now, but you're filming this.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Well, yeah, to add context.

                     MATT

          Context.   Andrew, you are...a weird

          dude.

                                                 CUT.

                    MATT (CONT'D)

          Did you ever read any Auguste

          Comte?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          What is that?

                    MATT

          He's this philosopher I'm reading.

                                                            4.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          For school?

                    MATT

          He's just like- his whole thing is

          about being positive and like,

          taking up for yourself. You should

          read him, maybe, it might make you

          feel- you know, improve your

          outlook.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Yeah, right.

EXT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - PARKING LOT

Andrew's getting out of the car, but then ducks back in to

see Matt lighting a pipe.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Are you not coming in?

                    MATT

          I'm gonna blaze a little first,

          yeah?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          You're going to miss first period-

Matt turns on the radio, loud.

                    ANDREW (O.S.) (CONT'D)

          Okay, okay.

INT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - HALLWAY

Andrew's filming himself putting stuff in his locker, and

does a quick sweep of the crowded school hallway.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          This is my school, I guess.   This

          is the hallway-

                    GIRL

          Vote "Kaz!"

A girl suddenly approaches, awkwardly handing Andrew a flyer.

                    GIRL (CONT'D)

          Vote Steve Kazinsky for Senior

          class president!

                                                            5.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)

          ...yeah-

                    GIRL

          Every vote counts.

Andrew films the flyer for a moment, brightly colored and

featuring a picture of a smiling Steve Kazinsky, before

something yanks the camera away.

For the first time we see ANDREW Detmer, 17, pale, awkward

and gangly, with long, stringy hair and thin, scraggly beard.

He looks anxious, if not afraid.

                    BRYCE (O.S.)

          Yo this camera is a piece of shit.

          It's like from 2004 or some shit.

WAYNE, 17, big and hateable in his Ed Hardy T-shirt, appears

wrapping his arm roughly around Andrew.

                    WAYNE

          Hey, how do I look?

              (starts muscle posing)

          Like this? Ooh, that's good.   Like

          this? That's sexy, right?

                    ANDREW

          Bryce, gimme my camera back-

                    BRYCE (O.S.)

          Fuck you Andrew, shut up.   This

          camera's a piece of shit.

                    WAYNE

          You got me, let's go.

Wayne turns and knocks everything out of Andrew's locker.

Bryce starts to walk away with the camera.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Hey, Bryce, come on, give it back-

The camera is set down on the ground, and then abruptly

kicked back to Andrew. He picks it up, checking on it.

                    ANDREW (CONT'D)

              (quietly, sad)

          Oh come on...

                                                            6.

EXT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - FOOTBALL FIELD

A view from the bleachers as the soccer team practices. The

cheerleaders are practicing too. We cut: a different view,

lower.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          This is where I eat lunch, out here

          on the bleachers.

                                                CUT.   LATER.

The camera's next to Andrew as he's eating, down on the

bench. A CHEERLEADER approaches.

                     CHEERLEADER

          Hi.

                     ANDREW

          Hey-

                    CHEERLEADER

          Could you not videotape us, please?

          It's really fucking creepy.

                    ANDREW

          I wasn't, videotaping you, so much

          as I was just-

         CHEERLEADER                           ANDREW

Just don't videotape-              -you know, filming what I do

                                   during the-

                    CHEERLEADER

          Don't videotape us, okay, or we'll

          call security. We see you watching

          us, we're not stupid, and it's

          sketchy, so back off.

                     ANDREW

          ...okay.

                    CHEERLEADER

          Is it on right now?

                     ANDREW

          Yes.

                    CHEERLEADER

          Turn it off.

Andrew turns off the camera.

                                                          7.

INT. MATT'S CAR

Matt's driving.   Andrew's filming from the passenger seat.

                    MATT

          There's a party tonight.    A barn

          party at Haven Hills.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          I thought Haven Hills was closed.

                    MATT

          It's abandoned, yeah. That's why

          it's a good place for a party. Two

          kegs.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Why are you telling me?

                    MATT

          You wanna go? I don't wanna go

          alone.

                      ANDREW (O.S.)

          ...Nah...

                    MATT

          When was the last time you went to

          a party?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          I don't like parties.

                    MATT

          You're a senior.     Just come, you'll

          have fun.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          I'll think about it.

                    MATT

          Okay, right. Andrew, can I give

          you like, a pro tip?

                      ANDREW

          Yeah?

                    MATT

          Keep the camera at home.    It's

          weird.

                    ANDREW

          It has a purpose-

                                                           8.

                    MATT

          I'm trying to be a good cousin,

          here. This is me being your

          friend, yeah? Okay?

EXT. DETMER RESIDENCE

Andrew is filming as he walks along towards his house.

                    HOWARD (O.S.)

          Hey, what you doing?

                    COSTLY (O.S.)

          Hey nice camera bitch, gimme your

          fuckin camera!

The camera pans up to reveal HOWARD and COSTLY, moron

hoodlums, along with several friends, over by a car on the

other side of the road, drinking forties.

                    HOWARD

          Hey don't film me nigga, don't film

          me.

                    COSTLY

          Hey fuck off, you better run to

          your house, bitch. Run to your

          house and lock the door.

Andrew just stands there filming them. Howard hurls his

forty at Andrew, who doesn't move; it shatters very near to

him.

                    HOWARD

          The fuck, fuck you faggot-

Howard quickly starts crossing the street, and Andrew turns

and runs back towards his house.

INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREW'S ROOM

The camera lays on Andrew's bed again, filming the room.

Andrew is on his laptop at a desk, working.

                    ANDREW

          I'm uploading what I shot

          today...you have to keep a back-up,

          you know.

The door suddenly opens, revealing MR. Adrian DETMER, 40s,

Andrew's father. He doesn't look as white trash as you'd

expect.

                                                          9.

Andrew looks up at him, and then goes back to working.

Detmer goes over to Andrew and slaps him out of his chair.

                    MR. DETMER

          When I say open this door, you open

          this fucking door.

Mr. Detmer leaves, slamming the door on his way out.   Andrew

sits on the floor in silence.

EXT. HAVEN HILLS FARM - NIGHT

We're in Matt's car, driving on a dark dirt road, past an old

fence and rusted out farm equipment.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)

          Are you sure it's here?

              (beat)

          Are you sure it's here, this all

          looks closed-

                    MATT

          It's here, calm down.    Listen.

We can faintly hear party music.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)

          Oh yeah.

EXT. HAVEN HILLS FARM - BARN

Cars are parked outside a big abandoned barn as Matt and

Andrew approach. We see Christmas lights strung up, and

there's clearly a party going on inside the barn. Kids are

milling about outside, too, drinking, fucking around.

                     MATT

          Hey dude, don't follow me around

          all night.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)

          What?

                    MATT

          Don't follow me around all night,

          okay?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          What am I supposed to do? I

          thought you said you didn't want to

          go alone-

                                                          10.

                    MATT

          Talk to people?   Have a beer, I

          don't know.

                                                 MONTAGED

                                               FOOTAGE...

Andrew skulks around the party, which is clearly in full

swing. Lots of bad footage of people talking, drinking,

girls dancing sexy, guys joking around. Andrew is silent and

detached, just filming. He sees a girl, CASEY Letter, 16,

filming as well. They shout over the music.

                    CASEY

          Hey, what are you filming for?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Oh, I don't- just filming.

                     CASEY

          What?   I'm filming for my blog!

                     ANDREW (O.S.)

          What?

                    CASEY

          I have a video blog!   Why are you

          filming?

Andrew simply backs away. More footage of the party.

AUSTIN, 18, in an Ed Hardy shirt, comes out of nowhere.   He's

clearly a little drunk.

                    AUSTIN

          Hey, were you filming my

          girlfriend? Yes or no, were you

          filming my girlfriend?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          No, I wasn't filming anyone

          specific, just filming the party.

                     AUSTIN

              (beat)

          Okay, good, because I don't wanna

          have to beat your ass.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)

          Okay.

                    AUSTIN

          Don't talk back to me. Don't get

          smart, okay, I'm being nice here.

          I'm being nice to you.

                    (MORE)

                                                          11.

                       AUSTIN (CONT'D)

              (beat)

          Say okay.

                       ANDREW (O.S.)

          Okay-

                    AUSTIN

          Cause I know you were filming my

          girlfriend dancing. I should break

          your fucking nose, you know that?

          You know that, I should beat your

          ass right now, but I'm trying to be

          nice. Fuck you.

Austin abruptly throws his beer on Andrew, getting some on

the camera, and then spits on him. Andrew backs up, shocked,

lowering the camera.

EXT. HAVEN HILLS FARM - EDGE OF THE WOODS

Andrew's out alone in a field now, furiously cleaning the

lens of the camera, obstructing our view. Cut to a few

moments later; the camera now resting in his lap or on the

ground. We can see the barn, the party still going on.

After a few moments, we can faintly hear Andrew crying.

                    STEVE (O.S.)

              (loud, sudden)

          Are you Andrew?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

              (startled)

          What-

                     STEVE

          Are you Andrew-with-the-camera?

              (beat)

          Matt's cousin, Matt said you had a

          camera?

The camera is picked up to reveal STEVE "Kaz" Kazinksy, 17,

approachably handsome and in great shape, with an easygoing,

instantly likeable charisma.

He's a little drunk and giddy.

                    STEVE (CONT'D)

          Dude, are you okay?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          I'm Andrew.

                                                        12.

                    STEVE

          I'm Steve Kazinsky-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          No, I know.

                     STEVE

          ...yeah?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Everybody knows who you are.

                    STEVE

          Haha, yes, that is true. Listen,

          come on, bring the camera.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)

          What?   I don't-

                     STEVE

          Come on.

Steve starts off, but Andrew hesitates.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)

          I don't-

                    STEVE

          Dude, come on, we found something.

EXT. HAVEN HILLS FARM - FIELD

Steve is walking ahead in the field of tall grass, toward

woods. It's rather dark.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Look, I don't think we're supposed

          to-

                    STEVE

          Is there a light on that?   On your

          camera?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Oh, I don't- Hm, I don't know-

The camera goes down for a moment while Andrew futzes with

it. The light clicks on, illuminating Steve.

                     STEVE

          Awesome.

                                                     CUT.

                                                        13.

They've reached the woods, and Steve is climbing over the

remains of a fence. The light bounces around wildly.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          What were you guys doing out here?

          This is way out-

                    STEVE

          Me and your cousin were blazing a

          little.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Matt's out here?

                    STEVE

          A bunch of people were out here,

          but I think they've all gone back,

          now, cause we're like, obsessed

          with the thing.

                      ANDREW (O.S.)

          The what?

                                                     CUT.

They're in the woods now, thick and dizzying. It's near

silent but their feet crushing the Fall leaves on the ground.

Steve walks out ahead.

                    STEVE

          Andrew Detmer, that's right.   I

          remember you from homeroom,

          Freshman year.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          You remember that?

                    STEVE

          Yeah, I have a memory for faces.

          I'm gonna go into politics, which

          is ironic because I'm soooo fucking

          high right now- probably shouldn't

          be letting you videotape this-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          I'm gonna be so rich when you're

          president, you have no idea-

                    STEVE

          Yeah, video footage of me luring

          you into the woods for gay sex-

          wait, hey- HEY, MATT, IS THIS IT?

                                                        14.

                       MATT (O.S.)

          Down here!

                       ANDREW (O.S.)

          Matt?

The camera turns to reveal Matt, standing next to some kind

of craggy hole in the ground, at the base of a hill in the

woods. It's big, but the darkness beyond is impenetrable to

the camera. It looks like a big black spot.

                    STEVE

          There we go. There it is.

                                                     CUT.

Andrew and Steve are now down with Matt by the hole. Andrew

is keeping the camera fixed squarely on the murky blackness,

nervous.

                    STEVE (V.O.)

          Where is everybody?

                    MATT

          They all left.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          We're not supposed to be out here.

                    STEVE

          Is it still making the sound?

                     MATT

          Yeah.   Did you tell Andrew?

                    STEVE

          Oh, Andrew, it's making a sound-

                    MATT

          Here, listen.

                       ANDREW (O.S.)

          Guys-

                    STEVE

          You've got to get really close to

          hear it.

Andrew takes a tentative step towards the hole.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Guys, just don't like- don't push

          me, or do anything like that-

                                                         15.

                    STEVE (O.S.)

          You've got to go closer.     Like

          almost inside it.

There's a beat.

                    MATT

          We're not going to push you, we

          just wanna get it on tape.

Another pause. Andrew moves towards the hole. Even with

Nightvision, it's completely dark in there. A beat.

                    STEVE (O.S.)

          Do you hear it?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          ...It's like, whispering?

                       STEVE (O.S.)

          Listen.

                       ANDREW (O.S.)

          Singing?

         MATT (O.S.)                       STEVE (O.S.)

Ooooh shiiiiit-                   That is so fucking creepy!

Andrew turns the camera back to Matt and Steve.

                    ANDREW (O.S.) (CONT'D)

          What is that?

                    STEVE

          We didn't dig the hole, man.

                    MATT

          Is the sound on the camera?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          I don't know, probably...I mean,

          it's- it's kinda loud, right?

Matt looks to Steve.

                    STEVE

          Do you guys wanna go in and have a

          look, or what-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          No, I don't- I mean, I won't do th-

                    STEVE

          Hold your nose.

                                                          16.

Steve suddenly goes right into the hole, vanishing into the

darkness.

                       ANDREW (O.S.)

          Hey, wait-

                    STEVE (FROM THE DARK)

              (faintly)

          Come on!

                    MATT

          Steve, come on, we don't know if

          it's stable in there- It's probably

          just the wind, we should-

Andrew abruptly goes into the cave.

                    MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D)

          Andrew, hey, come on!

          Don't...shit.

INT. THE HOLE

It's almost pitch black, but we can hear Andrew breathing.

It's claustrophobic in here. Eerily quiet. The camera

searches around, but the walls are tight in here, and low.

                       ANDREW (O.S.)

          Hello-

             STEVE                        ANDREW (O.S.)

   (suddenly appearing)           Aah!

I'm right here.

                    ANDREW (O.S.) (CONT'D)

          Does it go down much deeper, or-

                    STEVE

          Yeah, really far. It's not a cave,

          it's like a tunnel- do you hear how

          loud that's getting?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Do you think it could be like wind,

          or-

                    STEVE

          Come on, man. Come on.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Then what do you think it is?

                                                         17.

                   STEVE

          Huh. I dunno. I don't believe in

          ghosts.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Who said anything about ghosts.

Steve laughs, and turns, going back into the darkness.

Andrew follows.

                                                     CUT.

Matt's face is suddenly in front of the camera.

                    MATT

          -shouldn't have come in here.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Steve's up ahead-

                     MATT

          At first I thought this was a

          solutional cave, but now...I dunno,

          it's like a lava tube, or

          something.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          I don't know what you're talking

          about.

                    MATT

          Look at the walls. Look at how

          smooth they are. It's just

          straight shot down, I mean, we

          must've already gone forty or fifty

          feet-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Don't talk about it, you're making

          me nervous.

                    MATT

          You ever hear of Plato's allegory

          of the cave?

                       ANDREW (O.S.)

          No.

                       MATT

          Nevermind.

                                                     CUT.

                                                           18.

Walking. Darkness. The cave is even tighter now. The light

flickers, some kind of electrical disturbance, then goes out

completely We hear Andrew curse, fumbling with it, and the

nightvision mode comes on.

                                                      CUT.

The nightvision is scrambling badly.   All the forms are

distorted and then-

                    STEVE (O.S.)

          Can you believe this, this is NUTS-

The nightvision is turned off, revealing Matt. They've come

into a larger chamber in the cave, one somehow lit from

within; the boys are bathed in a softly pulsing turquoise

glow.

They speak loudly, clearly talking over something we can't

hear.

                    MATT

          Is that, is that showing up on the

          camera?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          I don't wanna film it, it's messing

          with the camera-

Matt forcibly turns the camera, to reveal Steve standing next

to some kind of massive crystalline rock structure growing

from, or maybe embedded in, the wall. Around it, and him,

float wispy little clouds of light, turquoise and beautiful.

Steve is clearly entranced, sweeping his hands through the

light.

                       STEVE

          Touch one!

We see Matt, now also surrounded by the little aurora

borealis like clouds, touch one; it comes apart in a silent

little explosion of light, beautiful.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Guys maybe...maybe we shouldn't...

A light cloud passes in front of Andrew, and we sees his hand

to extend to touch it. The subsequent little light burst

badly warps the camera, clearly permanent damage.

                                                      CUT.

                                                           19.

Andrew is now very near to the crystalline structure; viewed

up close, it's almost arachnid, organic somehow. The light

clouds have turned yellow. Matt is practically inside the

structure, pressing it with his palms.

                    MATT

          -changes color, see? It must be

          reacting to the heat, some kind of

          exothermic reaction-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          WHAT? I can't hear you over the-

          you know-

                    STEVE

          Make it change again!    This is

          awesome!

Matt presses with his palms. There's a low sustained hiss as

the light clouds turn an angry shade of red. A stream of

them is released from beneath the structure. The camera

jerks suddenly, revealing Steve, who's clutching his ears.

                     STEVE (CONT'D)

          AGHHHHH!

Blood has begun to rapidly pour out of his eyes, ears, mouth

and nose, and he buckles forwards; the camera spins wildly

and we see Matt seemingly FLUNG out of the crystalline

structure.

It pulses, and seems to rapidly blossom and spread apart,

revealing a blinding light within which EXPLODES OUTWARD; we

can suddenly hear an OVERWHELMING CHOIR OF VOICES, and the

camera sent rocketing backwards, flipping backwards up the

tunnel-

                                             CRACK.   DIGITAL

                                                        CODE.

                                              BLACK SCREEN.

                                             HOLD ON BLACK.

FROM ANDREW'S SECOND CAMERA.

EXT. MATT'S BACKYARD - AFTERNOON

The camera turns on; from the quality of the picture, it's

immediately evident that this is a newer, better camera.

It's on a tripod, and Matt stands across a well manicured

backyard; his hair is a little different, time has passed.

                                                        20.

                     MATT

          Ready?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Rolling, yeah.

                    MATT

          Okay, ball test.   Take one.

A baseball comes flying in from behind the camera, nailing

Matt in the face; he drops like a rock.

                     MATT (CONT'D)

          OW FUCK! WHAT THE FUCK STEVE!

          UNDERHAND!

Steve comes in from off camera to help Matt, laughing; we can

hear Andrew laughing behind the camera, too.

                    STEVE

          I'm sorry, oh shit, I'm sorry-

                                                     CUT.

Now it's Steve who stands on the yard.

                     STEVE (CONT'D)

          Go.

A baseball comes in from off camera, slower. It comes down

towards Steve, but at the last second makes a bizarre,

impossible course correction, FLIES UP AND HITS STEVE IN THE

FACE.

                     STEVE (CONT'D)

          AGH!   HEY, MATT, NOT COOL!

Matt rushes on, doing a victory lap, one hand holding an ice-

pack to his face. Again, we hear Andrew laughing.

                    MATT

          WE ARRREEE THE CHAAAMPIONS-

                                                     CUT.

Andrew's out across the yard. He looks a little better; he's

gotten rid of the ridiculous nerd beard, and his hair is a

little better kept. He nods.

In flies the baseball. It abruptly stops in the air, a foot

and a half from Andrew's face. Steve and Matt let out a

cheer, and the camera is yanked off the tripod, taken to show

a closer view of the impossibly suspended baseball and

Andrew.

                                                         21.

Andrew smiles, and points to the suspended ball.   A trickle

of blood comes out of his nose.

                      ANDREW

          Ah, shit.

                                                      CUT.

The camera's on a tripod up on the back porch, filming

Andrew, Steve and Matt standing a triangle. They are playing

catch...no hands. The ball simply flies from guy to guy.

They drop it a few times in some cuts, but shout

encouragement, and are clearly having a good time.

Finally, they get the ball going EXTREMELY fast.   Matt looks

up.

                      MATT

          Is-

Matt gets nailed in the balls, and drops as Steve and Andrew

rush to him, laughing.

                    STEVE

          `In the- penis- the penis-

                    MATT

          I thought I heard my dad...UGHHH

          WHY ME AGAAAAIN!?

INT. MATT'S KITCHEN

Steve is very intently using his newfound powers to make a

peanut butter and jelly sandwich, knife shakily moving over

bread. The camera is set down on the counter, Matt and

Andrew watching.

                    ANDREW

          The trick is to pretend like it's

          on a plate. You get it on the

          plate and then you wrap the plate

          around it, and you can move it

          however you want.

                      STEVE

          Mhm.

                    MATT

          I've been pretending I was like,

          holding it in a fist, like a

          floating hand.

                                                          22.

                     ANDREW

          Yeah?   Plate's easier for me.

                    STEVE

          Guys, check it out.

Steve has a glob of jelly and a glob of peanut butter

floating freely. They slap together and then down onto the

bread, which slaps closed.

                     STEVE (CONT'D)

          Ha!

              (notices his bloody nose)

          Shit, shit-

INT. MATT'S ROOM - LATER

Matt's room is covered in band posters, kind of a mess.

Matt's sitting on the floor by a desk, slowly assembling a

LEGO set with his telekinetic abilities. Andrew's filming

from the bed, where he's laying down.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Try to imagine that your squeezing

          the entire piece in your hand.

                    MATT

          That's what I'm doing, it's just,

          it's hard. You're better at this

          than me, you do it.

                    ANDREW

              (mocking)

          Really?

Andrew points at the lego set, and it flies together.

                    MATT

              (wowed, laughing)

          Dude, holy shit!

                                                        CUT.

Andrew and Matt are laughing as Steve enters, holding out his

cell phone.

                    STEVE

          Guys, listen, listen.   Samantha.

Steve puts his voice-mail on speaker.   SAMANTHA Pezon, 16,

sounds a bit frustrated.

                                                  23.

                    SAMANTHA (ON PHONE)

          I know you're over at that guy

          Matt's house right now, okay, cause

          they said you didn't show up for

          soccer practice, but you said the

          only reason you couldn't come see

          Bound By Love with me was because

          of soccer practice, so...You know,

          I just, I don't know what to think.

          I feel like we never hang out

          anymore, you've just been hanging

          out with those two guys for the

          last like three weeks, and I...ugh,

          call me back.

                    STEVE

          What would you suggest, as like, a

          course of action for me, here?

                    MATT

          Why are you asking US for advice on

          girls?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Because we're his mistress.

Steve laughs.

INT. STEVE'S CAR - NIGHT

Steve is driving Andrew home.

                    STEVE

          -new camera's working out for you,

          that's good.

                                                CUT.

                    STEVE (CONT'D)

          I have to admit, though, I don't

          understand the filming thing.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)

          I told you, it's just my thing for

          right now.

                    STEVE

          You don't feel like it's a little

          weird? Like it puts a barrier

          between you and everything?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Maybe I want a barrier.

                                                     24.

                     STEVE

          Okay.   I respect that.

                                                   CUT.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          My dad is actually a fireman, or

          was, I don't know. He got injured

          like two years ago, and now they

          just pay him out of, like,

          insurance. He doesn't do anything,

          I mean he goes out during the day,

          but I don't know where. He drinks

          a lot.

                    STEVE

          So how do you pay for your shit?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          I do computer repair, and stuff.     I

          actually make a lot of money...

                    STEVE

          What about your mom.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)

          My mom has spinal meningitis, she's-

          she can't work or anything, and the

          insurance doesn't cover all of her

          medicine, so a lot of my money has

          to go into that. I figure if I get

          enough on camera, maybe I can, I

          dunno, get custody of her or

          something.

Steve mulls this over.

                                                   CUT.

                    STEVE

          I've actually been having some

          problems with my parents, too.

                       ANDREW (V.O.)

          Yeah?

                    STEVE

          Nothing like yours, though.   Not-

          Never mind.

There's a long beat.

                                                           25.

                    STEVE (CONT'D)

          They've just been fighting a lot.

          I think my mom is cheating on my

          dad.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          ...That's intense.

                    STEVE

          Yeah. I know. I'm actually, yeah,

          I'm sure my mom is cheating on my

          dad.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          How-

                    STEVE

          I just, you know, I saw some stuff.

          It's weird, you don't think about

          your parents as like...people, or

          whatever. I don't know.

The two guys drive in silence.

                    STEVE (CONT'D)

          Don't tell anybody about that-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Haha no of course, no way.

                    STEVE

          Good.

INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREW'S ROOM

It's dark. We can hear shouting from elsewhere in the house;

"useless bitch," "carry your ass long enough," etc. Andrew

reaches over and turns off the camera.

EXT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - FOOTBALL FIELD - BLEACHERS

Matt, Andrew and Steve are eating lunch on the bleachers.

                     MATT

          See last night, alone, I got my

          whole bed off the ground. No

          nosebleed.

                    STEVE

          Yeah, I was doing weights, too.

                                                        26.

                    MATT

          Weights, like-

                    STEVE

          Free-weights, a barbell. I got up

          to two hundred pounds before I

          bled.

                    MATT

          So it's, yeah, this is my theory-

          it's like a vagina. Like it's

          elastic, but if you stretch it too

          far too quick it'll tear-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Ew-

                    MATT

          And that's why we're getting

          better. We're loosening up.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Couldn't that metaphor just be for

          any muscle in the human body, like

          working out or-

                    STEVE

          No, I like braingina.   Braingina is

          the shiiiiit.

Steve floats up a bunch of chips from his bag, and then rapid

fires them into his mouth.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          I think it's time we took this out

          of the backyard.

Matt and Steve look confused.

INT. STEVE'S CAR

Steve is driving, Matt's shotgun, Andrew's filming from the

back.

                    STEVE

          If anyone criticizes you, just call

          them a hater. It's like calling

          someone a racist, they'll just drop

          whatever they're complaining about

          and be like "I'M NOT A HATER."

          Nobody wants to be a hater.

                                                        27.

EXT. WAL-MART

Matt and Steve are walking in, Andrew lagging behind filming.

                    STEVE (CONT'D)

          Just stay back a little ways, yeah-

                      ANDREW (O.S.)

          I got it.

INT. WAL-MART

The guys are trying to stay out of sight, looking down an

aisle where shoppers stand.

                    STEVE (O.S.)

          That girl, with the cart.

A frumpy woman with a shopping cart suddenly starts pulling

on the cart. It suddenly breaks away from her, and goes

careening down the aisle by itself, her chasing after it. We

can hear the guys cracking up, trying to stay quiet.

                    MATT (O.S.)

          She's chasing- she's chasing it-

                                                     CUT.

Toy aisle. A toddler is looking at teddy bears.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          I got this.

One of the teddy bears suddenly comes to life, waving at the

little boy. The little boy is wowed. The teddy bear suddenly

takes off and flies through the air. Again the stifled

laughter.

                    STEVE (O.S.)

          Oh my god Andrew, look-

Andrew pans up to reveal a woman at the end of the aisle; she

saw everything, and is looking around, wide eyed.

                                                     CUT.

They're by the check out.

                                                         28.

                    MATT (O.S.)

          See that guy chewing gum?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Umm...

              (camera finds the guy)

          Got him.

                    MATT

          I'm gonna get the gum right out of

          his mouth- watch this.

There's suddenly a little air ripple in front of the man's

mouth, and he's yanked face first into the gum and candy

rack, which all crashes apart. The guys all crack up and

start running.

                     STEVE

               (laughing)

          GUYS, WHY ARE WE RUNNING!? We

          don't need to run, we don't need to

          run!

EXT. FIELD - SUNSET

Matt sits on the hood of a car.   He and Andrew are flinging

rocks with their powers.

                    MATT

          That was a good one, you got that

          one far.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)

          Hey Matt.

              (beat)

          Do you like me?

                     MATT

          What?

              (beat)

          Sure, yeah. I mean, I didn't,

          always-

                      ANDREW (O.S.)

          Why not?

                    MATT

          Don't get mad, I mean, I like you

          now, I like you a lot. You're

          just, you're not super easy to talk

          to. You've got a lot of-

                                                         29.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          You're an asshole.

                    MATT

          See, that's what I'm saying.

          You're hostile, man.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)

              (beat)

          You know, you...If you hadn't

          invited me to that party, none of

          this would've happened.

                     MATT

          Yeah.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)

          Thanks.

Matt laughs.

INT. MATT'S CAR - AFTERNOON - WAL-MART PARKING LOT

None of the guys are visible.   They're filming a woman park

her car.

                    STEVE (O.S.)

          I just always feel like I miss

          stuff.

                    MATT (O.S.)

          We were just sitting around

          throwing rocks, it was nothing.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Yeah, until all those chicks showed

          up.

                     STEVE (O.S.)

          What?   Shut up.

                    MATT (O.S.)

          Okay, here we go, here we go.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Are you sure there's no one around-

                     MATT (O.S.)

          There's no one, I just looked, just

          go, ready?

              (beat)

          Ready?

                     (MORE)

                                                        30.

                    MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D)

          Okay, Andrew, remember, get under

          it, you're the strongest, Steve get

          the sides, I'll get the front and

          back, we gotta do this quick.

          Countdown. Three. Two. One. GO.

The car the woman parked shakily lifts off, and immediately

dips right.

                    MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D)

          Steve Steve Steve-

                    STEVE (O.S.)

          Got it, got it.

Silence, and we watch as the car gets to about twelve feet in

the air, makes a full 180 degree rotation, and then wobbles

through the air over to a spot several spaces away, and then

sets down, neatly in place.

        STEVE (CONT'D)                  MATT (O.S.)

FUCK YEAH! BOOYAH!              YES! FUCK YES! OH SHIT,

                                blood-

EXT. WAL-MART - PARKING LOT - SHORTLY THEREAFTER

Matt is sitting against the car with a wad of kleenex on his

nose, soaked with blood. Steve is leaning nearby, with a

brown paper napkin.

                     MATT

              (beat)

          My braingina is having like

          a...face period.

                    STEVE

          Yeah, you got some from your ears,

          too. You've gotta start working it

          out more, Matt.

                    MATT

          Yeah man, in between my yoga.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          You just need focus, Matt.

                    MATT

          Ha.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          You're lucky you got the kleenex,

          I'm stuck with the taco bell

          wrapper.

                                                           31.

Andrew holds out said wrapper in front of the camera.

                    MATT

          That's like, at least twice as much

          blood as I usually see on a taco

          bell wrapper.

                    STEVE

          Guys, guys. Look.

The camera moves around to show the woman returning to the

space where her car was parked. She stops, baffled, and

looks around. We hear the guys stifle laughter.

She notices her car parked up ahead and walks over to it,

looking around. Andrew tries to get a better angle, and she

notices him, and stares.

                       STEVE (O.S.) (CONT'D)

          Ignore us!

                       MATT (O.S.)

          We're

              (beat)

          Mormons!

The woman stares a moment longer, and goes to her car.

INT. MATT'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Matt's driving, Steve's shotgun, Andrew filming from the

back. It's raining.

                    MATT

          -sfucking insane, we just changed

          her life. We did-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Her face, I can't get her face out

          of my head.

                    STEVE

          That was fucking great. I mean,

          this just gives me so many ideas,

          already, stuff we could do-

There's honking from outside.

                    MATT

          Oh come on, what is this?

                                                           32.

                    STEVE

          He's like right on your bumper,

          too.

Matt rolls down the window and gives the signal to pass.

More honking.

                    MATT

          Can you fucking believe this guy?

                    STEVE

          He's just some asshole redneck,

          look at him. He's fucking with us.

They are driving out over a bridge in the woods.

                    MATT

          I don't know what to do, what

          should I-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

              (laughing)

          Here, take the camera, take the

          camera.

He hands off the camera to Steve; now we see Andrew sitting

in the back seat. Behind him, through the back window, we

can see a pick-up truck, honking, way too close.

                    ANDREW (CONT'D)

          Abracadabra.

Andrew flicks his hand at the truck. The effect is

instantaneous: THE FRONT OF THE TRUCK CAVES IN LIKE IT JUST

HIT A BRICK WALL, WHAM, AND SENDING IT CRASHING OFF THE

BRIDGE, OUT AND DOWN AND INTO THE WATER.

                    STEVE (O.S.)

          ...I...what...

EXT. THE BRIDGE

The camera is being held loosely at Steve's side;

everything's upside-down, and we can't see anything, but can

hear the guys are clearly freaked out.

                    MATT (O.S.)

          What the fuck did you do, man, what

          the fuck-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          I didn't mean to, I didn't-

                                                           33.

                    MATT (O.S.)

          Fuck! SHIT! What's wrong with

          you, look at this, fuck!

                    STEVE (O.S.)

          Is he still in there? If he's in

          there we have to get him out-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Guys, just calm down, I'm sorry,

          okay-

                    STEVE (O.S.)

          Fuck that, take your fucking

          camera.

The camera is shoved to Andrew's chest, and lingers there a

moment before he brings it up to show a view off the bridge;

the truck is already sinking in the water fifteen or so feet

below. We tilt up to see Steve taking off his jacket.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          You don't have to- I mean I can-

Andrew raises out a hand, trying to telekinetically lift the

car. It rattles, and then Andrew groans in pain.

                    MATT

          Andrew, just stop, just stop doing

          things.

Steve dives off the side of the bridge.   Andrew films him for

a moment, swimming to the car.

INT. MATT'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Andrew's filming Matt, who looks angry as he drives very

quickly.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Are you mad?

                    MATT

          Stop, just stop.

EXT. RIVER SIDE ROAD

Matt and Andrew pull up to see Steve dragging the REDNECK

ASSHOLE out of the water. They hurry out of the car.

                                                      CUT.

                                                          34.

Steve has the guy on the shore.    He's dazed and bleeding.

                    REDNECK ASSHOLE

          -what happened, cause...I don't

          know....my truck, my truck...

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Is he okay?

Steve just stares directly at Andrew.   Andrew pans to reveal

Matt, on a cell phone.

                    MATT

          Yes, just past White Crescent

          bridge. Down by the- yes-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Is that the cops, are you calling

          the cops?

                    MATT

              (ignoring him)

          Yeah, just come- no, I don't know.

          I don't know, maybe internal

          bleeding, or-

                                                       CUT.

Later. The cops and an ambulance have arrived. An officer

is talking to Matt, Steve and Andrew; the camera is held low.

                    LOCAL OFFICER

          -looks like he'll be okay. Lucky

          you guys were here. Is that on?

          You can go ahead and turn that off.

The camera shuts off.

EXT. STADIUM PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Matt looks FURIOUS, while Steve just looks uncomfortable and

freaked out. Matt's car is parked nearby.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          I don't see how you guys can be so

          angry-

                    MATT

          You don't see how we can be angry?

          You put a man in the hospital for

          fucksakes. You put a man in the

          hospital, you hurt somebody-

                                                           35.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          He was being an asshole- he- I

          didn't mean to-

                    MATT

          Which part of that do you mean, do

          you mean he was being an asshole,

          or was it an accident? Was it an

          accident, Andrew, cause you're the

          strongest. Listen, with this, we

          can't fuck around, ever.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Then what've we been doing, we've

          been fucking around-

                    MATT

          NOT LIKE THAT, ANDREW. That's- you

          can't use it on people, or hurt

          people like- Steve, help me out.

Steve seems lost for words.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          I-

                    MATT

          We need rules, okay. Rule #1, you

          can't use it on living things.

          Rule #2, you can't use it when

          you're angry-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          You can't just declare rules,

          you're not-

                     MATT

          I will fucking declare rules, okay?

          If we keep going, and getting

          stronger, we need rules. We need

          rules.

              (beat)

          Damn it Andrew turn off the cam-

                                              SNAP TO BLACK.

INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREW'S ROOM

It's morning. The camera lays on the bed.     Andrew can be

heard breathing.

                                                CUT.   LATER.

                                                          36.

The camera moves, and is picked up, following a spider as it

moves across the floor. It crawls up onto the side of the

bed, then onto the sheets. Andrew's finger points at it.

The spider is telekinetically lifted into the air.    It hangs

struggling there for a moment, then becomes rigid.

He spreads his fingers, and the spider abruptly separates

into all of its component parts. They stop moving, hanging

lifeless.

Andrew's home phone rings, and he drops the spider.    Rings

again.

                    MR. DETMER (O.S.)

              (from downstairs)

          Andrew! Answer the fucking phone!

INT. MATT'S CAR - STEVE'S STREET

Andrew's filming Matt from shotgun.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Did he say what it was about?   When

          he called, what did he say?

Matt's quiet.

                    ANDREW (O.S.) (CONT'D)

          Are you still mad at me?

                    MATT

          I'm not mad.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)

              (beat)

          You seem mad.

                    MATT

          ...Power corrupts, is all I'm

          saying, man.

                    ANDREW

          What does that even mean?

                    MATT

          I just mean that we have to think

          about things more now, okay? We

          can't just DO things, we have to

          think first.

                    ANDREW

          ...I understand.

                                                           37.

                    MATT

          It's just- nah, nevermind, we're

          here.

EXT. STEVE'S HOUSE - MORNING

The house is big and nice, somewhat isolated.    Matt is

walking up ahead of Andrew to the door.

                      STEVE (O.S.)

          Hey kids.

Matt stops, and both Matt and Andrew look around.

                     MATT

          Steve?   Where are you?

                                                       CUT.

Steve is atop a power line pole, thirty feet in the air.

Andrew and Matt look up at him from the ground.

                    STEVE

          Just try it, it's easy.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          That doesn't look easy.

                    STEVE

          You throw yourself at the ground.

          You just fall, and catch yourself,

          and then it's easy, I swear. Don't

          try to jump or you'll flip

          yourself.

                                                       CUT.

Matt hurls himself at the ground, WHAM. Cut, and again,

WHAM. Cut, and this time he flips himself BAM WHAM.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Let me try-

                      MATT

          Yeah.    I'm done for now.

                                                       CUT.

Matt's now holding the camera, showing Andrew.    He checks the

street for cars.

                    MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D)

          No cars, no cars, go.

                                                         38.

Andrew throws himself forward.   And stops, hanging in mid

air.

                     ANDREW

           Whoaaaamygod...whoaaa...

Matt moves in for a closer look at floating Andrew, and gives

a glance up at Steve, who's cheering on the telephone pole.

                     MATT

           HOLY SHIT DUDE! HOLY SHIT, DUDE,

           HOLY SHIT! HOLY...SHIT DUDE, HOLY

           SH-

                                                      CUT.

EXT. SKY

At first it's not clear what we're looking at, just blue sky.

Wind is very loud. The camera pans down to reveal we're FIVE

THOUSAND FEET IN THE AIR, in a clearing between two larger

cloudbanks.

The camera pans all the way down to show Andrew's dangling

feet, and below them, the impossibly far drop. We can hear

Andrew laugh.

                                                      CUT.

We can see Steve and Matt, nearby, now wearing winter-coats

and hats to keep warm. They're playing catch with a

football. Steve tosses it to Andrew, who actually goes into

a short dive to catch it. He looks up to see Steve and Matt

distantly cheering and waving their approval.

                                                      CUT.

Steve's holding the camera, filming Andrew attempting a few

fancy moves, but he's a clumsy flier. Matt does a few neater

tricks in some clips.

                      STEVE (O.S.)

           Hey Matt, you're finally good at

           something!

                      MATT

               (loud)

           What? The wind!

                     STEVE (O.S.)

           I said you're an idiot!

Matt gives the thumbs up, and Steve laughs.

                                                          39.

                    MATT

          It's about aerodynamics! If I put

          a barrier just in front of me, I

          can go way faster, cause it cuts

          wind resistance!

                    STEVE (O.S.)

          I can't hear a damn thing you're

          saying!

                     MATT

          Yeah!   Definitely!

                                                        CUT.

Steve and Matt are seen flying around, Steve further away,

near a large cloud bank. Matt is using his abilities to

shape cloud fluff into an M. There is a humming, rattling

sound, slightly audible even over the deafening wind.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Guys, do you hear that?

Neither of the guys can hear him. Steve however stops in the

distance, looking around. He shouts something, inaudible.

                     ANDREW (O.S.) (CONT'D)

          What?   I can't hear you!

Steve pantomimes, pointing at his ear and shrugging.

A BOEING 737 BLOWS OUT OF THE CLOUDBANK BEHIND STEVE.    He's

spun like a top in its wake, and drops like a rock.

Suddenly we're launched downwards, and after a moment, the

camera disconnects from Andrew, and we see him zooming ahead.

The camera, in free-fall, spins wildly, then suddenly it

swims through the air dizzily and lands relatively gently in

some tall grass. Less than a second later, Andrew and Steve

come falling down into the grass and roll roughly, splitting

apart.

They lay there, breathing hard. Andrew sits up, coughing;

his eyes, nose and mouth bleeding. Steve suddenly leaps up.

                    STEVE

          WOO! HOLY FUCKING FUCK! I COULDA

          DIED, MAN! I ALMOST FUCKING DIED!

Steve grabs Andrew, shaking and hugging him.

                                                        40.

                      STEVE (CONT'D)

          You saved   my life, dude! Andrew,

          you saved   my fucking life! Is that-

          Holy shit   is that the camera?! You

                      AND THE CAMERA!?

          caught me

                    ANDREW

              (exhausted)

          Y- yeah-

                    STEVE

          FUCKIN' AMAZING!

Matt touches down behind them, frantic.

                    MATT

          What happened, are you-

                      STEVE

          Ahhhhh!

Steve joy-tackles Matt to the ground.

                    MATT

              (laughing)

          What the hell, what the hell-

Andrew, laughing tiredly, rolls over and grabs the camera.

                                                     CUT.

They're all standing in the field; Steve is still wigging

out.

                    STEVE

          This is what people have wanted

          forever, since like caveman times!

          Do you understand, I mean do you-

          jesus christ, I can't even-

          Everything is fucking great! I CAN

          FLY! Matt, listen, just say it!

                    MATT

          ...I can fly.

                    STEVE

          Shout it out man!

                     MATT

          I CAN FLY.

              (realizes it feels good)

          I CAN FLY!

Matt stands, shouting out at the field.

                                                          41.

                    MATT (CONT'D)

          I CAN FUCKING FLY!

Andrew cheers from behind the camera, and Steve laughs.

                       ANDREW (O.S.)

          I CAN FLY!

                     STEVE

          FUCK.   YES.

                                              HOLD ON BLACK

                                              FOR A MOMENT.

EXT. STEVE'S HOUSE - POOL - NIGHT

Steve, Matt and Andrew are sitting around the pool outside of

Steve's house; empty beers are all around. All three are at

least tipsy.

Matt is up.

                    MATT

          Yo Andrew, Andrew, gimme a beat.

                      ANDREW (O.S.)

                (flatly)

          No.

All three crack up.

                    MATT

          That's cold, you're so cold! MY

          OWN COUSIN! DJ Steve, dial me up-

Steve immediately starts beatboxing.

                    MATT (CONT'D)

          Okay, yo, yeah, yo, you say you

          wanna get high you ain't high as

          me, you chillin' at yo mom's house

          I'm at four thousand feet, cauuuse

          I got those tight muscles, in my,

          braingina, and you better believe

          I'm a, frequent flyer, and you know

          I don't need no turbines, ladies

          president, straight outta Oregon,

          gotta, represent, Matt Garrety

          bitches, I'm the young Clark Kent.

                                                        42.

Steve and Andrew cheer and Matt takes a bow.

                                                     CUT.

The guys have broken open glowsticks, and Steve is filming as

Andrew and Matt manipulate snakes of the glowing fluid at

each other; it's beautiful.

                                                     CUT.

We cut between three sing alongs; "Shake That" by Nate Dogg

and Eminem (which Andrew protests too, as he doesn't know the

lyrics), "How You Remind Me" by Nickelback, and "Macho Man"

by The Village People.

INT. STEVE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

The guys are in that sleepy mode, now. Andrew's filming, but

not really focusing on anything. Matt's sprawled out on a

couch opposite him. Steve's in a chair nearby.

                    MATT

          But how does she not notice?

                    STEVE

          Well, I mean, she notices that it's

          gotten better, definitely. You

          just have to be subtle.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          That's so cool. Doesn't that count

          as breaking rule #1 though?

                    STEVE

          Pfff, technicalities.

                    MATT

          Man, I haven't had sex since

          like...a year.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          I haven't had sex since ever.

                    STEVE

          Ugh, man, you guys...how are you so

          cool?

                    MATT

          Liquid nitrogen.

                                                     CUT.

                                                      43.

Later. Drowsier. Light's coming from the TV. The camera is

laying haphazardly on Andrew. They're all nearly asleep,

drowsy drunk.

                     MATT (CONT'D)

           Hey guys, are you up?

                        STEVE

           Yeah.

                        ANDREW (O.S.)

           YO.

                     MATT

           Today was like...the best day of my

           life. Like I was thinking and I

           can't think of any day I liked

           better than today.

There's a silence.

                        ANDREW (O.S.)

           Yeah.

                        STEVE

           Unanimous.     Yes.

                     MATT

           Okay...good.

Beat.   Silence.

EXT. HAVEN HILLS FARM - THE CLEARING - MORNING

Time has passed; maybe two weeks. It's early. The hole is

clearly caved in; the entire area is slumped downwards.

                     STEVE

           Well that answers that.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)

           I feel stupid now that I was scared

           to come back.

                     MATT

           Nah man, we were all- I mean, I

           was, definitely, yeah.

A POLICE OFFICER appears.

                     POLICE OFFICER

           Hey, you kids can't be here, okay?

           You gotta move on out.

                                                         44.

                       MATT

          What?

                    POLICE OFFICER

          The ground is unstable, we're

          cordoning the whole place off.

INT. DINER - MORNING

Steve is filming Andrew and Matt across the table.

                    STEVE (O.S.)

          I'm live on scene here with Matt

          and Andrew, boys, can you tell us

          what's happening?

                    ANDREW

          Well, uh, it would appear that a

          Virgin Mary has appeared in the

          maple syrup on a young local man's

          pancake.

                    MATT

          In a second it will, wait...

Matt focuses, and we see his syrup form a Virgin Mary.

                    STEVE (O.S.)

          That is, that is some very uh,

          definitely supernatural shit, going

          on there.

                                                     CUT.

                    MATT

          Well, when I was really little, I

          wanted to be police officer.

                    STEVE (O.S.)

          Oh, no shit?

                    ANDREW

          Fuck you, pig.

                    MATT

          No, I just really got into on the

          idea of altruism, you know?

                    ANDREW

          What's that mean?

                                                           45.

                    MATT

          Like making things better for

          everyone.

                    ANDREW

          So what, you wanna do like, a

          charity? That's lame.

                    STEVE (O.S.)

          Why is that lame?

                     ANDREW

          I dunno.

                    MATT

          I mean, I'm not gonna- it doesn't

          matter, you know. I'm never gonna

          get out of this piece of shit town.

          You know, we're all just little

          pieces. One person can't really

          make a difference. I used to think-

          I don't know. I don't know.

Matt telekinetically lifts a spoon and rockets it at the

camera; it plinks off.

                     STEVE

          AAH!   DOUCHEBAG!

                                                     CUT.

Now Matt has the camera, filming Steve.

                    MATT (O.S.)

          So what's it feel like to be good

          at everything?

                    STEVE

          I'm not good at everything-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Name something you're bad at.

                    STEVE

          I'm not GOOD at everything, I just

          do my best at everything. That's

          what it's about. I mean you talk

          about philosophy and shit all the

          time, but you never really do

          anything. Have you even applied to

          colleges yet?

                    MATT

          I'll get to it-

                                                        46.

                    STEVE

          You could use some of that, man,

          I'm just saying.

                    MATT (O.S.)

          Oh yeah? Well you could use some

          shut the fuck up.

                    STEVE

          You lack initiative.

                    MATT

          You lack...a dick.

EXT. ROAD - LATER

The guys are walking along. Andrew's holding the camera

loosely, not really caring, they're chatting, it's chill.

Matt gets a text.

                    MATT

          Shit man, I got my mom's birthday,

          I gotta go.

                    ANDREW

          Say hi for me.

                    STEVE

          Later dude.

Matt turns and casually rockets off into the sky.

                     STEVE (CONT'D)

          What're you doing, where are you

          going now?

                    ANDREW

          Well I don't wanna go home yet.

          You wanna go into the city?

                    STEVE

          Ah, dude, it's rush hour.

                    ANDREW

          So?

There's a beat, and then Steve laughs.

                    STEVE

          Hell yeah, dude.

                                                          47.

EXT. PORTLAND - THE ROOF OF THE KOIN CENTER - SUNSET

They're 46 stories up, chillin' with milkshakes.   It's

fucking awesome. The city is beautiful.

                    STEVE

          I wish I could bring Samantha up

          here. She'd love this.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          You still haven't told her?

                    STEVE

          Nah, no way. She'd freak out.

                                                       CUT.

                    STEVE (CONT'D)

          Mom's like, never home anymore. I

          mean, you saw how my dad is, he's

          just quiet. Sits around. I don't

          know. And talking to him about it

          is just pointless. He's got

          nothing to say.

                                                       CUT.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          And it's bad, because her pain gets

          real bad, you know, and we can't

          afford the good meds anymore. When

          I was little it wasn't as bad, but

          even then dad was still, you know,

          the way he is. I don't know. I

          don't know anymore. I don't know

          how to feel.

                                                       CUT.

                    STEVE

          It'll be fine, dude.    You'll figure

          it out.

                       ANDREW (O.S.)

          I hope so.

                    STEVE

          Hey, I wanted to ask you, winter

          break's coming up...You wanna do

          the talent show with me? Get you

          out there, you know, meet some new

          people.

                                                  48.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          No, I- I mean, no, that's not- I'm

          really shy, and I don't have any

          talents, or-

                    STEVE

          Yes you do, you have a talent, you

          have a talent.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

              (getting it)

          ...Oh, no way. No way-

INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - SANDRA DETMER'S ROOM

Sandra's in bed, sicker than ever.

                    SANDRA DETMER

          You look handsome.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Yeah, Steve chose my clothes, he's

          gonna do my hair.

                    SANDRA DETMER

          I'm glad you are spending so much

          time with your friends.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Oh yeah, me too.

                                                CUT.

Andrew's camera is down at his side.

                    MR. DETMER (O.S.)

          -getting to school?

                    ANDREW

          I don't know what you mean-

                    MR. DETMER (O.S.)

          Don't bullshit me idiot. Matt

          doesn't come, he don't drive up.

          You leave the house, and who the

          fuck is giving you rides to school?

                    ANDREW

          Matt.

                                                        49.

                    MR. DETMER

          No, wrong. Something's fucking

          going on with you, you can't hide

          it. Think you can slink around,

          sneaking- sneaking around the

          house, smiling, I know your shit.

          And we ain't got no more fucking

          money for your mother's pain

          medication, either.

                    ANDREW

          ...I'm sorry, I'll try to-

                    MR. DETMER

          Sorry isn't good enough, fuck up!

          You're a fuck up. You fuck

          everything up. Put that fucking

          camera away-

INT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - AUDITORIUM

At first, it's just a shot off Matt's feet, the camera

pointing down, and we can hear hub-bub all around. It goes

to nightvision for a moment, then over-exposes, then back to

normal.

                    MATT (O.S.)

              (grumbling)

          Fuck...the stupid...

The camera is levelled, showing a high-school auditorium's

stage. A group of kids are playing screamo music. Cut, a

little later. A girl is singing. Cut. Casey, the girl with

the videoblog from the barn party, is doing hip-hop booty

dancing. She's good. The camera lingers on her.

                    MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D)

          ...s'fuckin awesome...

                                                     CUT.

It's a few minutes later. "Techno-Syndrome" (MORTAL KOMBAT!)

begins to play. There's a beat, and then Steve, in a tuxedo,

rushes out onto stage. The applause is DEAFENING, girls

screaming, etc.

He raises his hands for silence, and then "presents" Andrew,

also in a tuxedo. Mixed reaction from the crowd. Andrew's

carrying a deck of cards; he fumbles them, they spill onto

the floor. Audience laughter; Steve throws up his arms in

exasperation.

                                                          50.

Andrew shrugs, and all the cards leap back up into his hands.

There's a beat, and then the audience goes APESHIT.

                     MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D)

          Yes!   Fuck yes!

                                                     CUT.

Andrew is juggling, six balls at once. Steve is drinking a

soda, and offers Andrew the soda. Andrew is annoyed. Steve

pantomimes joy at not having to give up his soda. Andrew

stops juggling, leaving all the balls hanging in the air, and

snatches away Steve's soda.

Steve lunges after him and gets back his soda, only to have

all the balls drop out of the air and hit him. The audience

is LOSING THEIR FREAKING MINDS.

                                                     CUT.

People around Matt are buzzing about how awesome it is.

Andrew is transporting buckets of water across the stage,

spilling water everywhere. Steve is pantomiming anger at the

shoddy job he's doing. Andrew pantomimes "Well, you try."

Steve tries, but trips and falls, sending the contents of the

bucket flying out over the audience-

-only for it to seemingly REWIND back into the bucket!    The

place GOES BERZERK.

                                                     CUT.

Steve and Andrew take their bows to overwhelming cheers,

separately. Andrew bows again, and people freak out. We

hear Matt cheering behind the camera.

INT. MATT'S CAR - NIGHT

Andrew's filming from shotgun.

                    MATT

          Just amazing dude-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          You really think so-

                    MATT

          Are you fucking kidding, I've never

          seen a reaction like that in the

          auditorium, you guys- it was

          fucking like- it shook the

          building. You guys are rockstars.

                                                        51.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Yeah, it did- it did feel like

          that. All the girls screaming-

                    MATT

          Ah, see, here's the first stage of

          your downfall, hubris.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          What's that?

                       MATT

          What?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          What's "hubris?"

                       MATT

          Seriously?

                     ANDREW (O.S.)

          What "seriously," fuck you

          seriously!

                    MATT

              (laughing)

          I'm sorry, I'm sorry-

                     ANDREW (O.S.)

          Hey Matt.

              (beat)

          What's "seriously" mean?

EXT. HOUSE PARTY

It's a house party, raging. Steve's out on the porch with

his girlfriend SAMANTHA, 16, super hot, of course.

                    SAMANTHA

          AAAH ANDREW!

Samantha runs down and embraces Andrew, knocking around the

camera.

                       SAMANTHA (CONT'D)

          Hi Matt!

                    MATT

          Hi Samantha!

                                                        52.

                    SAMANTHA

          Everybody's freaking out, you've

          gotta come in here-

                                                     CUT.

We see shots of the house party, which is rocking. People

keep coming up to Andrew and telling him "That was awesome!"

Or "You fucking rock!" Andrew sheepishly acknowledges this.

Finally, a very hot girl with pink hair and a monroe piercing

is talking. This is MONICA, 16. She's a little drunk.

                    MONICA

          Just fucking amazing. Magic is so

          hot. Do you know, me and my mom,

          in Vegas, went to a magic show, but

          they didn't have anything like

          that.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Yeah, well, we spend a lot of time

          practicing-

                    MONICA

          Do you not remember me, at all?

                     ANDREW (O.S.)

          What?

                    MONICA

          We took American History together.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Oooh, oh yeah, your hair was

          different; it was blue, right?

                     MONICA

          Yeah!

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Monica, yeah-

                     MONICA

          Yeah!   Hiiii!

                                                     CUT.

More shots of the party, of Monica talking. She entreats

Andrew to join her on a beer-pong team. A little tipsy,

Andrew agrees, setting down the camera on a couch. It lays

there. SOME GUY picks it up.

                                                        53.

                    SOME GUY

          And now, you get a special treat,

          I'm gonna film myself taking a

          piss.

Matt snatches away the camera from him.

                                                     CUT.

Matt's walking around with the camera now he films people

dancing, talking, a people taking shots. Casey passes,

filming for her video blog. Matt's camera follows her, but

then goes back to Steve, who's cheering on Andrew and Monica,

who are of course dominating at beer-pong. But they take

shots anyway.

                                                     CUT.

                    STEVE

              (drunk)

          Matt, you have the camera yeah?

          You have the camera, cause, don't

          let him forget the camera, okay?

          That's Andrew's camera.

                      MATT (O.S.)

          Right on.

                                                     CUT.

Matt wanders the party; a stoner comes up.

                    STONER

          Hey Matt, wanna blaze?

                     MATT (O.S.)

              (beat)

          No, I'm good. I'm just filming for

          Andrew.

                    STONER

          Andrew? He's upstairs in the

          bedroom hooking up with that,

          whatshername, hair girl.

                    MATT (O.S.)

          Yeah, I'm a little drunk though.

          Movies! Makin movies.

The stoner wanders off.

                    MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D)

          I'm making an experimental film.

                                                        54.

EXT. HOUSE PARTY - PORCH

Matt turns the camera around to film himself.

                     MATT

          Hey Andrew, hope you're seeing

          this. Congratulations, sir. I'm

          drunk, sorry. I was really worried

          about you, like, before everything,

          but I do feel like...

              (beat)

          I feel like this will get better

          for you, man. I'm sorry I haven't

          been there for you as much, you

          know, when we were growing up,

          because, I know you could be an

          angry...be an angry dude. But I

          love you, you know. Detmer-Garrety

          extended family for liffffeeeeee.

              (beat)

          But listen when did I become the

          one who's...who's out alone filming

          myself, with the camera-

                      CASEY

          Hey Matt.

The camera spins to reveal her, and then immediately drops to

Matt's side.

                    CASEY (O.S.) (CONT'D)

          What were you filming?

                    MATT (O.S.)

          Just a thing, it's nothing like-

          you know, Eye Of The Storm or

          anything-

                    CASEY (O.S.)

          You watch my blog?

                    MATT (O.S.)

          I- yeah, a lot of people do. I've

          actually been stalking you since

          like, sophomore year- sorry, use of

          the word stalking-

                    CASEY

          Stockings are why I love Christmas.

          You wanna get outta here? This

          place is too loud for me.

                                                          55.

                    MATT

          Yeah, I- YES- yeah, just gotta drop

          off the cam-

Matt fumbles with the camera, turning it off.

                                               BLACK SCREEN.

                                              HOLD ON BLACK.

INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREW'S ROOM - MORNING

We can hear it raining hard outside.

The camera is laying on its side on the floor, and turns on

when Andrew fumbles with it. There's screaming from

downstairs; long and low, real pain sounds.

Andrew drops the camera and rushes out the door.    The camera

lays on the floor. Time passes.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

              (faintly)

          Mom, it's going to be okay, okay?

          Just try to get through, it's going

          to be okay.

Mr. Detmer enters, and notices the camera.    He reaches down

and picks it up.

INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM

In the squalid living room of the Detmer residence. The

camera is being held off at an angle by Mr. Detmer, as Andrew

tries to get it back. It moves around a bit, so Andrew and

his father are both on/off screen.

                    MR. DETMER

          -think you can fucking use me,

          you're abusive, you're a fucking

          user little piece of shit. I went

          through your camera.

                    ANDREW

          What'd you...You- what'd you see?

                    MR. DETMER

          Just you fucking being a drunk

          mess, spending my money, drinking

          with your fucking friends-

                                                           56.

                    ANDREW

          I didn't spend any of your money,

          RICHARD-

                    MR. DETMER

          Cause I don't have any fucking

          money to spend, it all goes to

          school for you, for medication for

          your mother-

                    ANDREW

          School doesn't cost any money, I go

          to public school you idiot-

                    MR. DETMER

          -now we can't afford your mother's

          pain meds anymore, up there

          screaming- did you just- what THE

          FUCK DID YOU JUST CALL ME? CALL ME

          A FUCKING IDIOT?

Mr. Detmer hurls the camera directly into Andrew's face.    It

knocks him down and clatters to the floor.

                    ANDREW

              (clutching his face)

          You asshole, you fucking crazy

          asshole-

                    MR. DETMER

          GET OUT OF MY HOUSE! YOU'RE DONE

          LIVING HERE, GET OUT!

Detmer rushes up to Andrew and slaps him, and again, and

again, and again, and WHAM! Andrew backhands Detmer HARD,

flooring him. Andrew turns and picks up the camera, leveling

it coolly on his father as he tries to stand.

Andrew's arm snakes out and grabs Detmer by his throat,

lifting him easily and slamming him against the wall.

                    MR. DETMER (CONT'D)

          I can't- can't move-

            ANDREW                        MR. DETMER

I COULD CRUSH YOU. YOU KNOW     Get- off- let me go- you're

THAT, I CAN FUCKING CRUSH       hurting me-

YOU. I CAN KILL YOU WITHOUT                                      *

EVEN FUCKING TOUCHING YOU.

Andrew turns and flings Mr. Detmer into the sofa, which flips

on the impact. We can hear Andrew's gasping sobs, panicked,

as he turns, runs out of the house, and LAUNCHES INTO THE

AIR.

                                                        57.

EXT. THE THUNDERSTORM

Andrew's just below the clouds, massive dark and ominous

above him. It's clearly not safe, rain and wind whipping his

body, lightning crackling inside the clouds. We can hear him

breathing hard.

He touches the bottom of a cloud, and gets a powerful

electric shock, forcing him to back off a tiny bit.

                     STEVE (O.S.)

          HEY!   HEY ASSHOLE!

The camera turns, showing Steve, in a rainslicker, flying up

to meet Andrew.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Where's Matt?

                    STEVE

          We have to get down from here right

          now, Andrew! This isn't safe!

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          Where's Matt?

                    STEVE

          Hung over, dude! You should be

          too! Let's just-

                       ANDREW (O.S.)

          No!

                    STEVE

          What the fuck are you doing?

                     ANDREW (O.S.)

          I'm filming the storm, no one's

          ever filmed a storm like this up

          close bef-

                    STEVE

          No, we're getting the fuck down,

          now. This is fucking crazy, Andrew-

          what- what happened to your face?

                       ANDREW (O.S.)

          ...My dad-

                    STEVE

          Your dad fucking beat the shit out

          you! Come on, we'll go to the

          cops, let's get out of here. He

          can't do that Andrew.

                    (MORE)

                                                           58.

                    STEVE (CONT'D)

          This is not the way you handle it,

          we'll go together, let's go, he

          can't do that-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          You don't give a shit, stop acting

          like you care!

                    STEVE

          I don't fucking care!?    You're my

          best friend, idiot!

                      ANDREW

          ...What?

                    STEVE

          I hang out with you and Matt

          practically every fucking day! You

          think I talk to anyone else about

          my parents, or my feelings on shit,

          are you that fucking insecure?

                    ANDREW

              (long beat)

          I'm an idiot. I'm sorry Steve, oh

          god, I'm sorry-

                    STEVE

          Dude, it's okay.     You just need

          help, okay?

                    ANDREW

          Yeah, yes, I don't know what I'm

          doing-

                    STEVE

          It'll be fine. But we've- ...Do

          you hear that? I hear...singing.

A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHTNING STRIKES STEVE, BLASTING HIM OUT

OF THE SKY. The boom of thunder is deafening.

For a moment, all we can see is the stormscape, and then we

hear Andrew's rushed, panicked breathing.

                                                      DIGITAL

                                                DISTORTION TO

                                                       BLACK.

EXT. CEMETARY - DAY

It's a gray, dark day. A funeral is in progress; we're

filming from within the mourning party.

                                                             59.

A large picture of Steve is on a stand as the priest reads a

eulogy. Andrew's camera movements are rigid again, tight and

confined, back to how they were when we first started.

We see Steve's mother and father. His mother is sobbing.

His father simply looks shellshocked, staring at the casket.

Steve's mother leans on his father, and he pushes her away.

There's Samantha, crying uncontrollably. The camera passes

Matt...

Who's staring directly at us.

                                                       CUT.

Andrew walks along in the cemetary, filming tombstones.

                     MATT (O.S.)

           What are you doing? Filming

           graves, I don't get it.

The camera looks up at Matt.    He's keeping his distance.

                     MATT (CONT'D)

           You're not returning my calls, why

           aren't you returning my calls.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)

           I've been busy.

                     MATT

           No you haven't. Why aren't you

           returning my calls. Turn off the

           camera.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)

           ...No.

                     MATT

           Turn off the camera.

Silence.

                     MATT (CONT'D)

           I had a missed call from you, that

           morning. And from Steve. I

           listened to your voicemail. No

           voicemail from Steve.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)

           I was upset.

                                                60.

                    MATT

              (long beat)

          How do you get struck by lightning

          during a storm with no recorded

          lightning strikes?

              (waits, nothing)

          You can look that up online, you

          know, they keep track of it. I

          looked it up. Zero. And they find

          him out in a field, why would Steve

          go out in the middle of a field

          during a lightning storm?

The camera shifts a little.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          I don't know-

                     MATT

          What?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          I don't know-

                    MATT

          No, no, you do know, you do know, I

          think you do know.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)

          I don't.

                    MATT

          What happened, Andrew. Just stop,

          stop lying to me, and tell me-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          I'm not lying, I don't know what

          happened-

                    MATT

          I don't believe you, okay! I don't

          believe you, I want you to- put the

          fucking camera down.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)

          No, why-

                    MATT

          Because I want to talk to you. Put

          it down- put it down, Andrew,

          please- put it down, turn it off,

          put the fucking-

                                                         61.

Matt, very upset, suddenly advances on Andrew, trying to pull

the camera away. He's suddenly shoved backwards; Matt

recovers himself before he falls, staring at Andrew. The

camera hangs limply for a moment.

                    MATT (CONT'D)

              (breaking down a little)

          What did you do, Andrew? What am I

          supposed to do? Who am I supposed

          to tell, about this, man? Who do I

          tell? I mean- I don't, I don't

          know how I'm supposed to- Why won't

          you just tell me what happened?

The camera and Andrew suddenly launch into the air, rocketing

away from Matt.

INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREW'S ROOM

The camera is on Andrew's dresser, near his mirror.   Andrew

suddenly appears, holding a kitchen knife.

                    ANDREW

              (addressing the camera)

          -wanted to show you what I was

          talking about.

Andrew takes the camera, and angles it down at his arm. He

takes the kitchen knife, and presses the tip into the flesh

of his wrist. He drags the blade down hard, all the way to

his elbow...but no cut appears. He then violently jabs

himself several times...but no penetration.

                    ANDREW (CONT'D)

          See, it's- I put a little sheet

          between myself and the knife, and

          the barrier, the sheet, is too

          strong. The knife can't cut it. I

          mean like, what I'm saying is if I

          concentrate, I can't be hurt. I

          can't be injured. Because of the

          little sheet.

EXT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - FOOTBALL FIELD

Andrew sits alone on the bleachers. The cheerleaders are

practicing. The camera zooms in on Samantha. She sits alone

on the sidelines, watching numbly.

                                                        62.

INT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - HALLWAY

Andrew is putting his stuff away in his locker. He's

suddenly shoved into the locker roughly. The camera turns,

revealing Wayne walking away.

The camera scans the mostly empty hallway quickly, then goes

back to Wayne, now almost twenty feet away.

                       ANDREW (O.S.)

          Hey Wayne!

                    WAYNE

          What, you got a probl-

One of Andrew's hands flicks out, and Wayne's mouth suddenly

gushes blood. Wayne screams, falling, and is immediately

tended to by other students.

INT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - BATHROOM STALL

Andrew has laid out three small bloody objects on the back of

the toilet, and presents each one to the camera one by one.

They're Wayne's bloody teeth.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          See, this one, I got clean, cause I

          did a little lasso around the root,

          but these two, they're broken cause

          I think I pulled them from the

          middle. Matt was always better at

          the little, the intricate stuff, he

          got good at that. See how broken

          it is, ugh, sloppy.

INT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE

Mike FERNANDEZ, 30s, serious but warm, sits across the desk

from Andrew. The concern in his voice is very real.

                    FERNANDEZ

          Could you put the camera away?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          No, I'm filming this. I film

          everything.

                                                       63.

                    FERNANDEZ

          I understand that things have been

          very hard for you recently, Andrew,

          but the camera kind of- it

          alienates a little, you know?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          What did you want to talk about?

                     FERNANDEZ

              (beat)

          There's concern for your grades,

          Andrew. And as far as I know

          you've yet to apply to any

          colleges, so-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          It's not doable. Financially,

          they're not- I mean, my dad didn't

          go to college either.

                    FERNANDEZ

          Well, yes, but I still think it's

          worth thinking about. There are

          three different community colleges

          locally that offer great programs

          for-

                     ANDREW (O.S.)

          I don't need college, Mr.

          Fernandez.

                     FERNANDEZ

              (beat)

          I think that's a very close-minded

          attitude, Andrew. I know that you

          come from a difficult background,

          and I know how horrible the pain

          can be when you lose a friend. But

          I don't think you should let this

          make you lose hope. I mean, this

          is your future. You don't want to

          compromise your future.

              (long beat)

          Andrew?

INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREW'S ROOM

The camera is sitting on the floor. We can hear screaming

from downstairs. Andrew picks up the camera, and goes to the

mirror, filming himself filming. After a beat, he steps out

from behind the camera, leaving it hanging in the air.

                                                         64.

He stands looking at himself, and then the camera. The

camera turns to face Andrew. He doesn't look good, but gives

a weak smile.

INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - MS. DETMER'S ROOM

We're peeking in through the door. We can see Sandra Detmer

writhing around in agony in the bed, moaning in pain. She

lets out a long scream, and then seems to notice us watching.

                    SANDRA DETMER

          Richard is that you? Richard, you

          have to let me have my medicine, I

          can't...Andrew? Who is that?

          Look, please come in here, I need

          help to turn over. It hurts,

          please, Andrew, you have to tell

          your father...tell your father to

          get my medicine...

Sandra, her eyes closed in pain, is lifted and rolled onto

her side.

                    SANDRA DETMER (CONT'D)

          Andrew...thank you Andrew...was

          that you? Did you-

The door closes.

EXT. JUNKYARD - NIGHT

The junkyard is filled with junked cars, metal garbage, old

equipment. The camera sits awkwardly on the hood of a

wrecked car as Andrew fidgets to get it mounted. The area is

lit by lights from the main building, not too far away, but

you can tell he's not supposed to be in here.

                                                      CUT.

Andrew moves out in front of the camera. He telekinetically

pulls an old car forward, and lifts it easily. He moves it

left, moves it right, rolls it, sets it back down.

                                                      CUT.

Andrew is sitting, resting, tired.   He speaks directly to the

camera.

                                                          65.

                     ANDREW

          I've been doing a lot of reading,

          like you know, online, about

          evolution, and the way it works,

          and you know, natural selection.

          The uh...

               (cut)

          The strongest animals will always

          survive, and they're the ones that

          you know, will prosper, or grow,

          and survive, by feeding on the

          smaller animals. And as humans we-

          see, there's...uh-

               (cut)

          There's this thing called an Apex

          Predator, and basically what that

          is the most powerful predator in an

          ecosystem. And humans, you know,

          we're the apex predator, because

          there's nothing that preys on us,

          cause of weapons and stuff. But if

          something could, I bet it would.

          I...

               (cut)

          I mean, what I'm trying to say is,

          a lion doesn't feel guilty when it

          kills a gazelle. You don't feel

          guilty when you squash a fly, you

          know- I think that means

          something. I think it really means

          something.

                                                      CUT.

Andrew's back out with the car. He lifts it again, then

makes a quick "squeezing" motion. As he does this, the car

violently compresses down to the size of a basketball.

Andrew flings the ball of metal into a scrap pile, which

collapses loudly.

Andrew falls down onto his butt, a little exhausted, but as

he gets up he is abruptly attacked by a guard dog, which

bites him twice before he's able to fling it off.

The dog recovers, and rushes Andrew, who raises a hand,

blasting the dog across the yard, killing it instantly.

Andrew turns and looks at the camera, and it turns off.

FROM CASEY'S CAMERA.

Everything is crisper, cleaner, brighter.   Higher resolution.

                                                           66.

INT. CASEY'S HOUSE - BATHROOM

We're looking at the door to a bathroom, only a crack open.

It's pushed open, revealing Matt, shirtless, brushing his

teeth.

                      CASEY (O.S.)

            AHHHH!

Casey runs up and hugs Matt from behind, startling him.

INT. CASEY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

Matt is cooking; he's got four different things on the stove.

                      CASEY (O.S.)

            How'd the interviews go?

                      MATT

            I told you how the interviews went.

                      CASEY (O.S.)

            But now we do it for the camera.

               MATT                         CASEY (O.S.)

UGHHHHHH-                        Come on.

                      MATT

            UCONN not so good, Columbia was

            good, University of Miami was

            really good, Arizona State was

            okay.

                      CASEY (O.S.)

            Who ended up paying for all of the

            airfare? Did your parents-

                      MATT

            Haha, no, I told you they wouldn't.

                      CASEY (O.S.)

            Did you pay?

                      MATT

            Nope. Nobody. I flew myself.      I

            needed the exercise.

                       CASEY (O.S.)

                (beat)

            You are a man of mystery.

Matt smiles.

                                                        67.

                    CASEY (O.S.) (CONT'D)

          God, how do you always cook so many

          things-

Matt snatches the camera away from her, turning it to reveal

that she's topless; Casey has already covered up with her

arms.

                    CASEY (CONT'D)

              (running away)

          AAH! AHH OH MY GOD MATT AAAHHH!

                                                     CUT.

They're at the breakfast table. Matt's eating, and Casey,

filming, is talking between bites.

                    CASEY (O.S.) (CONT'D)

          You have to do at least one of your

          tricks for the camera, though.

                    MATT

          I am so sick of being filmed, you

          have no idea, Casey-

                    CASEY (O.S.)

          No I know, but I'm not going to use

          any of this. I just want you to do

          a trick, one of your good ones.

                    MATT

          When do your parents get back from

          Spain?

                       CASEY

          A week.

                     MATT

              (beat)

          Okay, if you don't film me for one

          week-

                       CASEY (O.S.)

          Ahhhh-

                    MATT

          One week, I'll show you my new

          trick. I guarantee you will shit

          bricks. Yeah?

                       CASEY

          ...Ughhhh.

                                                         68.

INT. CASEY'S HOUSE - CASEY'S BEDROOM

Matt's asleep in bed on a different day.   Casey's filming

from next to him.

                    CASEY (O.S.)

              (whispering)

          I'm filming you and you don't know.

          I'm terrible. I'm gonna show you

          this later and you're gonna be like

          "whaaaaaaaaaat!"

EXT. CASEY'S HOUSE - BACKYARD

Matt runs out ahead of the camera, and does a little shuck-

and-jive boxer dance.

                       CASEY (O.S.)

          You ready?

                       MATT

          I'm ready!

                    CASEY (O.S.)

          Are you sure-

                    MATT

          Let's do it! Woo!

Casey raises a paintball gun out ahead of the camera. She

fires. Matt's arm whips out, impossible fast. He holds up

the caught paintball.

                     CASEY (O.S.)

              (awed)

          Holy shit, Matt.

                     MATT

          COME ON!   BRING IT ON!

Casey fires several more shots, Matt catches them

effortlessly, then hurls them all into the air. Mid-air,

they all pop, some of the paint landing on the camera and

Casey.

                    CASEY (O.S.)

              (laughing, awed)

          Matt, oh my god, oh my god!

                                                        69.

INT. CASEY'S HOUSE - CASEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

It's dark; the camera turns on, then the light, revealing

Matt, groggy, half awake.

                    CASEY (O.S.)

          What happened?

                    MATT

          Ughhhh camera...I had that dream

          again.

                     CASEY (O.S.)

          Tell me.

                    MATT

          It's like I'm...I'm not me, I'm

          something else. And I'm out in

          this...out in space. And stars are

          all around me, and I'm zooming past

          them; everything is really like

          three-D, I can see the shape of the

          stars. I'm looking for somewhere

          to sleep, or something, and I see

          earth, and I go down to earth. And

          then...I don't know, just the main

          part is that I'm out and there are

          the stars and they just look like

          millions of little points of

          light...And Steve is there.

                    CASEY (O.S.)

          Steve is there?

                    MATT

          Yeah but he feels like he's not

          part of it. Like he's there

          separately, inside my head. Andrew

          is there too. I don't know. I'm

          worried about Andrew.

              (beat, slyly)

          Why don't you put the camera away?

                    CASEY (O.S.)

          Oh yeah? What's gonna happen to me

          if I put the camera away-

                    MATT

          Oh I think you know. I think you

          know what's going down.

                    CASEY (O.S.)

          We could leave the camera on.

                                                          70.

                    MATT

          You arrrrreeee...C'mere.

Matt advances on Casey, and the camera falls off to the side

of the bed. We can hear her giggling, which is abruptly

muffled by kissing.

EXT. CEMETARY - DAY

The camera is aimed at Steve's tombstone. There are still

flowers and memorials spread around. Some are rotting. The

camera moves around a little, then back to Steve's tombstone.

INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREW'S ROOM - NIGHT

Screaming from Sandra's bedroom. The heater rattling. The

TV from downstairs. There's a knock on the window. The

camera is picked up, to reveal Matt floating outside, looking

around nervously.

After a moment, Andrew opens the window.

                                                       CUT.

Matt stands fidgeting, clearly uncomfortable, as Andrew films

him.

                    MATT

          You haven't been returning my

          calls, so I thought I'd just...you

          know, ambush.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          That's rude.

                    MATT

          I just- I've been getting, you

          know, bad vibes or whatever.

Andrew is silent.

                    MATT (CONT'D)

          I know you stopped coming to

          school, and my mom said you guys

          are having a lot of problems with

          money. I'm worried about you.

                                      71.

           ANDREW (O.S.)

Why?   Your life's great-

          MATT

Dude, don't be like that, okay-

          ANDREW (O.S.)

You don't need to worry about me.

I'm stronger than ever now. I can

lift a whole car by myself. I

could fucking crush this entire

house, I'm fine.

          MATT

That doesn't- that actually sounds

like the opposite of fine. Andrew,

come on, let's get out of here,

your room's a mess, it smells like

a Denny's bathroom in here.

             ANDREW (O.S.)

So what?

          MATT

You're my cousin. You're my friend-

it's my responsibility to take care

of you.

          ANDREW (O.S.)

I think you should go. I have to

pick up my mom's medication.

           MATT

...Are you going to break the

rules?

    (beat)

We're too strong now, Andrew.

We're too strong for that. If you

did that, you know I'd have to-

          ANDREW (O.S.)

You'd have to what. You were

always the weakest. You couldn't

do shit to me.

             MATT

...Andrew-

          ANDREW (O.S.)

I'm not gonna break your stupid

fucking rules, just fuck off and

stay out of my life.

                                                        72.

Matt stands staring at Andrew. The camera fidgets

uncomfortably. Matt shakes his head, and the camera follows

him as he goes to the window, gives Andrew one last look, and

then rockets off into the sky.

The camera sits in silence, pointed at the window.

INT. PHARMACY

The camera approaches the counter.

                     PHARMACIST

           Hello, how can I help you.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)

           I'm here to pick up a prescription

           for Sandra Detmer.

                     PHARMACIST

           Um, yes, hold on. That's Imuran,

           Baclofen, Glatiramer and Vicodin.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)

           That's right.

                     PHARMACIST

           Okay, and the copay on that

           is...Seven hundred and fifteen

           dollars, eighty three cents.

Silence.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)

           I have to come back.

                     PHARMACIST

           Okay, we'll hold it for you.

INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREW'S ROOM - LATER

Andrew is filming out his window, watching his father leave.

His stereo plays David Bowie. Once his dad's car is gone,

Andrew sets down the camera on the dresser opposite the

mirror, and leaves the room.

Time passes, and Andrew reappears, now dragging a crate. He

opens it, and pulls out his father's fireman's uniform. We

do short-space time cuts as he takes out the jacket, looks at

it, and turns it inside out, so that the metallic fireproof

inner lining is exposed.

"Ziggy Stardust" comes on Andrew's stereo.

                                                        73.

Andrew, wearing the jacket, looks at himself in the mirror,

his back to the camera. He reaches down, and picks something

up, looking at it, then pulls it over his head.

It's a gas mask.

He stands there staring at the surreal, hard edged, faceless

figure in the mirror. Looks right. Looks left. Adjusts the

mask.

Then turns and whips out his hand; the camera is abruptly

yanked across the room.

EXT. RUN-DOWN HOUSE - SUNSET

It's a run-down house in Andrew's neighborhood. The

streetlights and the setting sun give everything light in

yellow orange haze.

Howard, Costly, and some other thugs are chilling on the

porch, laughing loudly, smoking a blunt. They clearly

haven't noticed Andrew, who's filming from out by the street.

He reaches down, and picks up a rock, then hurls it at the

house. It flies up and breaks a window. Costly, Howard and

the thugs immediately mobilize, swearing and posturing as

they rapidly surround Andrew.

He doesn't react.

                    HOWARD

          You are about to get fucking

          stomped, you know that right? You

          hear me son? Come to my house,

          it's late, I don't see any fucking

          police officers or some shit, I

          don't know what you you think

          you're doing throwing shit at my

          house-

                    COSTLY

          No, wait, what the fuck. What the

          fuck are you dressed up like that

          for. Are you high?

                    HOWARD

          Lil' Andrew's straight up tripping

          right now, I don't even know, I'ma

          give your ass a wake up call-

Howard starts towards Andrew, who raises a hand out in front

of the camera. He makes the "gun sign."

                                                           74.

                    HOWARD (CONT'D)

          Oh you got a gat? I got a gat too

          bitch-

Howard starts to pull a gun from the back of his pants.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)

              (firing the finger gun)

          Bang.

Howard's body abruptly FOLDS BACKWARDS with a sickly loud

chorus of cracks, and then is FLUNG ASIDE. The thugs,

shocked, don't have a second to react before Andrew

telekinetically BLOWS ONE OF THEM BACKWARDS, sending him

smashing headfirst through the windshield of his car.

Costly and the remaining thug start running, and the

remaining thugs legs suddenly flip up out from under him,

breaking, bending and twisting like a rag doll, before he's

propelled face first into the ground, WHAM.

Andrew launches into the air, coming down just in front of

Costly, who skids to a halt.

                     COSTLY

          -no, no-

Costly is shoved to the street and ground back and forth as

though under the weight of a giant thumb, leaving a

glistening smear of clothes, blood and skin, before he falls

across the curb.

We can hear the men screaming and groaning in agony, but

other than that, the night is silent.

Andrew raises a hand, and all of their wallets and loose

money lift away from them, flying to him. There's a beat,

and then Andrew launches into the air.

EXT. RADIOTOWER - 80 FEET UP - TWILIGHT

Andrew sits under one of the red airplane spotter lights on

one of the strut supports. The camera sits nearby, watching

the expressionless figure as it counts the money.

There's a beat and he hangs his head. We can hear muffled

noises of frustration from under the mask. Something that

sounds like a low, angry scream.

Very suddenly, he dives off the tower. A second later, the

camera is yanked after him, zooming out into freefall.

                                                          75.

EXT. GAS STATION

Andrew, holding the camera, touches down just outside the gas

station. He waits a beat, and then starts to walk towards

it. We transition to...

FROM GAS STATION SECURITY CAMERAS.

Black and white, a slightly grainy feed, with no audio.

We watch from the camera by the pumps as the bizarre figure

in the coat and the gas mask, holding the camera out in front

of it, strides past people pumping gas, into the station

store.

INT. GAS STATION

The wall mounted security camera shows us the whole store.

Andrew enters, turning to the clerk behind the register, who

says something, looking concerned. He's suddenly blown out

of frame.

After a beat, the register rips itself free from the counter,

and floats over to Andrew.

Andrew turns and walks out, the register floating with him;

as he does, a second clerk rushes out, panicked, yelling. He

goes behind the counter, and grabs a shotgun.

EXT. GAS STATION

Andrew exits the gas station, as does the clerk, who yells,

raising the shotgun.

Andrew whips an arm out towards him, and the clerk fires as

he's hit by a wave of energy. The shotgun blast goes wild,

striking the stacked tanks of propane next to the garage.

The effect is instantaneous; a blinding white flash of fire

envelopes the clerk and floors Andrew, the camera we look

through jerking awkwardly, the feed breaking down.

FROM ANDREW'S SECOND CAMERA.

The camera lays awkwardly on its side, the distorted audio

from its damaged microphone SUDDEN AND PIERCING.

It's been flung a good deal away from Andrew, who lays

motionless, burning.

                                                       76.

The clerk is dead, and a nearby gas station customer is

horribly injured and screaming. His gas pump lays on the

ground, pumping out gas onto the asphalt.

Andrew slowly shifts, unable to move properly, and forces

himself to roll over. The fire on his body touches the fire

on the asphalt, and spreads lightning fast to the gas pump.

The resulting explosion engulfs the entire station.

The camera is spun violently out into the street-

                                                  VIOLENT

                                           DISTORTION AND

                                          CRASH TO BLACK.

FROM SECURE ROOM VIDEO FEED

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

The camera is color, with crackly, strange, somewhat

distorted audio. The image is a little blown out.

Andrew on a bed. His entire right side is absolutely

scorched; the flesh looks like bloody, cracked paper,

blackened and red. The parts of him that are bandaged are

already soaked through with blood.

He is barely breathing, hooked up to various machines.

Andrew is not going anywhere anytime soon. This is ensured

by the handcuff on his left wrist.

The machines beep. Andrew doesn't move. The door opens, and

Mr. Detmer enters, speaking to a POLICE DETECTIVE on the

other side of the door.

                    MR. DETMER

          -come down to the city, cause his

          mother's all alone right now.

          She's got MS, I had to leave her at

          the house all a fucking alone.

                    POLICE DETECTIVE

          I understand, Mr. Detmer.

                    MR. DETMER

          Shit. Jesus, look at this.   Can I

          have a moment with my son.

                    POLICE DETECTIVE

          Yeah I- I'll be outside the door,

          yeah?

                                                        77.

                      MR. DETMER

          Okay.

The officer closes the door, and Mr. Detmer goes and sits

down in a chair next to the bed. He sits there staring at

Andrew, clearly horrified and upset, and buries his head in

his hands. We SPEED UP THE RECORDING, and Detmer just sits

like that. After five minutes of speed up, we slow down.

                    MR. DETMER (CONT'D)

          I want you to apologize to me.

Andrew is comatose.

                    MR. DETMER (CONT'D)

          I said I want you to apologize to

          me. I know you can hear me. So I

          want you to sit up and apologize to

          me. I want you to stop this

          bullshit right now.

Andrew is comatose.

                     MR. DETMER (CONT'D)

          Do you know how much this shit is

          going to cost me? Do you know what

          you've done to your family?

              (beat)

          You don't even care, do you? You

          just don't give a fuck, you've got

          your fucking morphine, don't you.

There's a beat, and then Detmer suddenly slaps Andrew's burnt

shoulder. Andrew flinches badly, and his pulse speeds up on

the monitor.

                     MR. DETMER (CONT'D)

          Stop it. I'm not buying this shit,

          you can't just play this off like a

          fucking

              (slap)

          Game, this is real. You really

          fucked me, me and your mother you

          know that, you little

              (slap)

          Shit.

Andrew no longer flinches, but the slaps leave red, bleeding

molten welts. Detmer stands up, clearly upset, and takes a

quick pace forward and back.

                    MR. DETMER (CONT'D)

          Goddamn it, goddamn it!-

                                                           78.

Detmer goes to slap Andrew again, and Andrew's arm jerks up.

Mr. Detmer floats is telekinetically lifted into the air.

He hangs screaming and struggling for a moment, then becomes

rigid.

Andrew spreads his fingers, and his father abruptly separates

into all of his component parts.

They stop moving, hanging lifeless, then drop to the ground

in a bloody mess.

Andrew's eyes open, revealing black-red eightball

hemorrhages, and he seizes badly, letting out a scream of

agony, and then another, tearing at his IV.

The police detectives rush the room, reacting with horror to

the gore that was Andrew's father. They barely have time to

scream out when Andrew snaps his cuff free of the bed, and

lets out AN ENORMOUS CONCUSSIVE BLAST, blowing apart

everything in the room including the camera.

                                              SMASH CUT TO:

FROM CASEY'S CAMERA.

INT. CASEY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

All of Casey's family is present, along with lots of little

kids. Everyone's gathered around Casey's little brother,

who's being presented with a birthday cake. Matt looks

happy.

                    EVERYONE

          -appy birthday to you!

Everyone let's out a cheer, including Casey, but then she

notices Matt abruptly duck out. She follows him to the

bathroom...

                                                      CUT.

...where he's holding his nose, which is bleeding badly.

                       CASEY

          Matt-

                     MATT

          Do you hear that, how can you not

          hear that?

                                                          79.

In the background, we can hear the house phone ring.    Then

cell phones.

                    CASEY

          Matt, what hap-

                    MATT

          The singing, how can you not hear

          that!? Something's wrong, okay,

          something's wrong with Andrew, or-

                    CASEY

          Matt, please, okay, you're scaring

          me, are you okay-

                    MATT

          No, something's wrong, something's

          wrong.

Matt pushes past her, running upstairs. Casey starts to

follow, but then stops, lowering the camera.

                    CASEY'S MOM (O.S.)

          Casey, you have to come in here.

                    CASEY

          Mom, Matt is-

                    CASEY'S MOM

          Come in here right now.   Come in

          here right now.

                                                        CUT.

Casey's filming the big screen TV, which is showing the news.

                     REPORTER

          -going to have a feed live on the

          scene in the second, we apologize

          for the delay but as of right now

          every news helicopter in the

          greater Multnomah County is headed

          to Portland- again, right now we

          have very little information, but

          the word is that the bombings

          started just over nine minutes ago,

          and haven't subsided yet, with-

          okay, here's the feed from NBC

          Chopper 5.

We get a helicopter view from over downtown Portland,

everything seems okay, and then something streaks by,

crashing headlong into the side of a building.

                                                        80.

The impact is like a wrecking ball, office furniture blowing

out into the air along with glass, steel and concrete, WHAM.

                    FIELD REPORTER (O.S.)

          Wait, that was- that was not a bomb-

          I repeat, not bombings, it's

          something else-

The camera turns as Matt rushes down the stairs, now in his

winter parka, his nose plugged with kleenex. We hear another

of those jarring, shattering impacts, and the camera goes

back to the TV, revealing the big MADE IN OREGON sign in Old

Town toppling down into the street.

                    MATT (O.S.)

          I need your car.

                    CASEY (O.S.)

          What? Matt, look, what's

          happening, look at what's happening-

                    MATT

          I see, I know, I have to go, okay-

                    CASEY (V.O.)

          Don't leave, don't leave me-

                    MATT

          Give me your keys.

                     CASEY (O.S.)

          I- Matt-

EXT. CASEY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Casey is chasing Matt across the lawn to her car, her voice

filling with panic, the camera being held offhanded now,

unimportant.

                    CASEY (O.S.)

          Please don't leave, don't go-

We hear helicopters pass low overhead.

                    MATT

          I have to go to the city.

                    CASEY (O.S.)

          NO MATT PLEASE, PLEASE-

                                                         81.

                    MATT

          I can't fly if there are all these

          helicopters in the air, I just have

          to drive there, or, listen, I have

          to figure this out, Andrew's in

          trouble. This is my fault.

                     CASEY (O.S.)

          Andrew?   What are you talking ab-

Matt gets in the car and starts it.   Casey's breaking down,

openly crying now.

                    CASEY (O.S.) (CONT'D)

          Matt please! MATT PLEASE, PLEASE

          DON'T GO, I'M AFRAID! MATT I'M

          SCARED, PLEASE!

INT. CASEY'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Casey's sitting shotgun as Matt drives. His face is

unreadable. They're driving on the I-5. More helicopters.

Downtown Portland is visible now, as are some fires.

Casey is quietly crying, the camera held loosely in her lap.

                    MATT

          This is all my fault.

                   CASEY

          No! No it isn't!   It isn't your

          fault!

We hear and see the lights of ambulances and police cars as

they zoom past, but Casey keeps the camera on Matt.

                    CASEY (CONT'D)

          Matt, it's not safe. It's not

          safe. What's going on. What's

          happening. Why are we doing this,

          Matt, please. Please take me home.

          You don't have your license, you

          can't drive without your license.

                                                      CUT.

They're getting into downtown now. We can hear sirens.

Casey is filming out the window, everything looks normal,

until there's a loud crash; then Casey swishes the camera to

reveal that a police car, its siren still moaning, has landed

on top of a newstand, apparently dropped from the sky.

                                                         82.

                    CASEY (CONT'D)

          How- how is that possible, that's

          not possible-

There's an explosion from nearby and shattered glass rains

down onto the car. Matt slams on the brakes, looking up

through the windshield, searching the sky.

                    MATT

          Where are you, man?

There's a beat, and then a police officer abruptly appears on

the passenger's side, next to Casey.

                    POLICE OFFICER

          Listen, you can't be here, I need

          you to turn this car around right

          now and-

The police officer is yanked upwards, disappearing from sight

for a moment before coming crashing down thirty feet away.

Casey screams.

                    CASEY

          What's...What is...What's...Matt

          please, please-

The car SUDDENLY ROCKETS INTO THE AIR, straight up, flipping

end over end, past the tops of the buildings, and then comes

to a stop, hanging at about two hundred feet. Casey's

breathing is painfully short and sharp. Matt stares out into

the night sky.

He flicks on the brights. There's Andrew, in his hospital

gown, floating a dozen feet out, his flesh charred and

twisted, his body clearly wracked with agonizing pain.

A news helicopter circles past out of sight, and for a

moment, Andrew is framed in the chopper's spotlight.

His eyes flash to the car.

                    ANDREW

              (screaming)

          WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE!?

The windshield is TORN OUT, and seconds later MATT IS RIPPED

OUT OF THE CAR AS THOUGH YANKED BY A GIANT HOOK, taking his

seatbelt with him.

                     CASEY

          No NO NO

                                                         83.

The car goes into freefall, no longer important to Andrew,

plummeting down, down, down. Casey's screams are barely

audible over the rushing of the wind as the buildings rush

past outside, her camera frozen in place as she plummets to

her death.

And then suddenly, so suddenly it's completely disorienting,

the side of the car bursts apart and we're flying, blurred

views of buildings, the sky, the side of some jeans...

Stillness. Casey's camera is pointed down, showing her

adidas...and Matt's high-tops.

                    MATT (O.S.)

          Stay here, okay? You have to stay

          here.

                    CASEY (O.S.)

              (barely coherent)

          You can fly?

                       MATT (O.S.)

          Stay here.     I have to talk to

          Andrew.

                    CASEY (O.S.)

          Matt..what...

                    MATT (O.S.)

          Casey, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

Matt's feet suddenly go out of frame.

                       CASEY (O.S.)

          Matt wait!     WAIT PLEASE!   MATT!

NOTE: In the following sequence, everything is seen in

glimpses and glances, never lingering too long on one thing.

Much of what happens should be seen through implication,

rather than direct effect.

Everything happens very fast, and none of the cameras can

fully keep track.

FROM SEVERAL HELICAMS.

The feed is crisp and clear, but without the satellite audio,

meaning no narration from the reporter. There are several

chopper's flying at different distances from the action, and

we intercut as necessary.

                                                        84.

EXT. DOWNTOWN PORTLAND

The news chopper at first shows Casey's destroyed car laying

in the street, then pans back up to show Andrew, who's

floating hunched over, vomiting.

Matt flies up behind him, and tries to help him, but Andrew

shoves him away. We're too far away to hear anything that's

said.

Matt tries again, and Andrew yells something. Matt, clearly

upset, replies. Andrew, talking fast and jerky, gestures

towards his burns. Matt tries to reply several times, but

Andrew isn't hearing it. Matt smiles nervously at the

destruction, and says something gently.

Andrew replies, and whatever is said here, it causes a

radical shift in Matt's demeanor. He's no longer concerned;

he seems repulsed. Andrew says more, clearly SCREAMING at

Matt.

Matt seems to beg Andrew for something and Andrew relents.

Matt continues, more forcefully, and then notices something

to his right. A BUS SMASHES HIM OUT OF THE AIR, SWATTING HIM

LIKE A BUG INTO THE SIDE OF AN APARTMENT COMPLEX.

Andrew suddenly turns, flailing an arm at us in the chopper;

a mailbox comes CRASHING UP INTO THE CAMERA.

FROM MICHAEL ERNESTO'S CAMERA.

MICHAEL ERNESTO is, along with several other people from his

building, out on his roof. He watches in horror as the

helicopter Andrew hit goes out of control, falling out of

frame.

Moments later, we hear the explosion as it crashes.

                    MICHAEL ERNESTO (O.S.)

          Oh, oh no, those people, man, those

          people, oh god-

                    ERNESTO'S NEIGHBOR (O.S.)

          Where's the other guy?

                    MICHAEL ERNESTO (O.S.)

          He's fucking dead man, you saw- oh

          shit oh shit-

Andrew comes toppling down out of the sky like a wounded

bird, crashing into the roof. He vomits again, mostly bile;

everyone around him is in shock, frozen, as he screams in

pain and rolls over.

                                                        85.

He's bleeding badly from the nose and ears.

                    ANDREW

              (agonized, crying)

          No one's gonna help me...No one's

          gonna help me now...

We get some shots from other people's cameras, video phones,

etc on the roof. Some people scream and try to run past

Andrew, and he blasts them off the roof like bowling pins,

which leads to more screaming.

Andrew stands shakily, looking directly at Michael Ernesto.

                    MICHAEL ERNESTO (O.S.)

          Please man, please, I don't know

          you man-

                    ANDREW

              (mumbled)

          What type of camera is that?

                    MICHAEL ERNESTO (O.S.)

              (breaking down)

          What? I don't know, I don't know

          you man, I didn't- please okay,

          please-

Andrew starts to raise an arm, when he's suddenly NAILED BY

MATT, blasting by at well over eighty miles an hour.

FROM BANK SECURITY CAMERA.

The inside of the bank is quiet and peaceful, when MATT AND

ANDREW COME CRASHING THROUGH THE ROOF.

FROM POLICE CAR DASHBOARD CAM.

The police car rockets up the street, but has to screech to a

halt when MATT AND ANDREW COME EXPLODING OUT OF THE FRONT OF

THE BANK.

The two of them brawl in the street for a moment; it's not

impressive martial arts, or even super powered, just two guys

fighting for their lives. Matt gets the upperhand, decking

Andrew and driving him to the ground, and suddenly the cop

car (our POV), lifts off.

WE GO FLYING INTO MATT, crashing out the camera as he turns

and creates a telekinetic wall.

                                                        86.

FROM CALA PRENTI'S CAMERA.

CALA, filming from her apartment window, watches in shock and

horror as the police car, carried by its momentum, is sent

FLIPPING INTO THE AIR, and we glimpse it as it passes her

window, lights still flaring.

Her sister rushes up, looking out the window.

                    CALA (O.S.)

          Sissy stay away from the window!

                    SISSY

          What's happening what's happening-

                    CALA (O.S.)

          They're right out there fighting!

          They're-

Andrew and Matt come BLASTING UP THROUGH THE FLOOR IN THE

KITCHEN OFF TO THE RIGHT, AND THEN OUT THROUGH THE CEILING.

FROM KPR-PORTLAND'S HELICAM.

The two boys come smashing up through the roof of the

apartment building. Andrew flies low, and Matt gives chase.

Andrew turns, beginning to telekinetically lob everything at

street level at Matt; traffic lights, parking meters, trees,

etc...

...But Matt's too good a flyer. What he doesn't block he

simply dips and weaves around. Andrew, clearly still woozy,

is distracted and smashes into a street-light, wiping out on

the asphalt.

                    CAMERA-MAN

          They're down. One of them just

          went down. Jesus christ.

Matt slowly lands nearby. The camera zooms in and hits them

both with a spotlight, causing Matt to shield his eyes and

look up, scared, as Andrew struggles to stand.

We get a good look at the toll this is taking on him; Matt's

face is a crimson mask of blood from his nose, eyes, mouth

and ears. He's limping badly, his clothes torn, visibly

covered with injuries. He looks like he's been in a car

wreck.

                    CAMERA-MAN (CONT'D)

          Oh shit, look at him.

                                                         87.

He approaches Andrew, talking again, more fervently. Andrew

just shakes his head, falling repeatedly as he tries to

stand, like a wounded dog.

Two cop cars skid to a halt nearby, the officers unloading

and taking cover. One of them advances on Matt and Andrew,

gun raised. Matt goes out in front of Andrew, protective,

pleading, raising his hands.

The cop is clearly panicked. He fires a shot.    Matt's arm

whips out, impossible fast; he buckles and screams in pain,

holding his hand, which is gushing blood.

                                            Andrew blasts the

Matt falls, screaming, and Andrew stands.

officers backwards.

                     CAMERA-MAN (CONT'D)

          OH SHIT!   Oh jesus christ!

Andrew approaches Matt, screaming and looking absolutely

terrifying. Matt turns and ROCKETS OFF INTO THE SKY, Andrew

following a second later, tackling Matt out of the air.

FROM KPR-PORTLAND'S LIVE-ON-THE-SCENE.

We're at street level in downtown, people are absolutely

everywhere, wandering out into the street, baffled, scared

and looking for answers. A FIELD REPORTER fixes herself,

preparing to speak.

                    FIELD REPORTER

          Are we...Okay, yeah, gimme- two,

          one- We're live on the scene on

          Parson Boulevard just south of the

          center of downtown, and-

There's a rushing, screeching sound from around the corner.

The camera jerks, and moves towards the corner, the cameraman

man running to see what the sound is.

                    FIELD REPORTER (CONT'D)

          Shawn, wait, you're unplugged.

          Shawn-

Something around the corner explodes, and Matt comes flying

past overhead, slightly on fire, before Andrew comes lunging

at Matt, catching him, twisting out and over the camera man,

SLAMMING HIM INTO THE SIDE OF A SKYSCRAPER ON THE STREET.

Andrew lifts Matt up high into the air, scraping him against

buildings on either side of the street, bouncing like a

pinball until-

                                                           88.

FROM ABC 5'S HELICAM.

-Matt struggles, and there's a visible ripple in the air; a

massive concussive burst, sending both of them rocketing

downwards as though shot out of a cannon.

They strike the massive bronze statue of "Portlandia," a

trident wielding demigoddess, in front of the Michael Graves

building, uprooting it from its pedestal before crashing to

the ground.

Matt's body accordions brutally when he lands, and he flops

down at a broken, dead angle. Andrew lands nearly as badly,

lays still for a moment, and then begins twitching and

screaming when the chopper's spotlight hits him.

FROM MICHAEL GRAVES' BUILDING EXTERIOR SECURITY CAMERA

The statue of Portlandia lays awkwardly in the street.

Andrew writhes. Matt is motionless, blood pooling around

him, his back broken.

FROM POLICE DASHBOARD CAMS, HELICOPTER CAMERAS, HANDHELDS

FROM WINDOWS, EVERYTHING.

A bunch of squad cars and emergency units converge around the

front of the Michael Graves building and downed statue. Matt

and Andrew's bodies are painted by spotlights as police and

news helicopters hang overhead.

Police unload en-mass, guns out, immediately forming a

perimeter and pushing in. We're with them as they approach;

the mood is of barely controlled panic, officers shouting

back and forth to each other.

Andrew and Matt are polka-dotted by red-laser sight dots.

Andrew suddenly stands up, and several officers fire; the

bullets spark off an invisible barrier in front of him, and

he shakily raises both hands.

The all of the police officers, firemen and paramedics are

telekinetically lifted into the air.

They hang struggling for a moment, and then all of their

limbs go rigid. We've seen this before.

Andrew screams, and then...It all happens in under two

seconds:

                                                         89.

Matt swings an arm, blinding fast; the triton wielding arm of

Portlandia bends jaggedly, bringing down the pitchfork hard,

first through Andrew, then into the pavement.

Andrew stands impaled, a look of shock on his face, and then

Matt flails up his hand; the bullet lodged inside fires out,

striking Andrew in the head, killing him instantly.

All of the floating people drop, dazed.

Matt collapses.   After a moment, the police advance.

                                              CUT TO BLACK.

FROM CLEAN ROOM CAMS.

The clean room cams are incredibly hi-def, crisp and clear,

with all manner of data and time codes scrolling all over the

top and bottom of the screens.

Matt lays on the floor of a perfectly white room. At the far

end is a blackened out two way mirror. There's a camera on

the inside of this too, and we can see resolute men in suits

reflected on the inner glass, watching with unreadable

expressions.

There is a chair and a table, but he's clearly fallen out of

the chair. It's maybe an hour after the scene in front of

the Michael Graves building, and he's received no medical

attention.

To this end, Matt is suffering from, among other things,

massive blood-loss, multiple broken bones, dozens of gashes

and cuts, presumed internal bleeding, and a broken back.

He can barely move, sliding around on the floor in his own

blood as he dies, watched by the compassionless eyes of the

cameras.

He is barely coherent, screeching in agony.

                    MATT

          Please...Help me. Help me, HELP ME,

          please...I'm sorry! I'm so sorry,

          I tried- help me, help me, I'm

          dying, I'm dying. Stars- I see

          stars, somebody- It hurts, please.

          I'm- the blood...I tried...

Two men in contamination suits enter the room, wielding some

kind of radiation sensors. They go over to Matt, scanning

him.

                                                          90.

                    MATT (CONT'D)

          Listen, help me, help me. I'm

          dying, you have to help me, don't

          just let me- PLEASE I'M SORRY! I'm

          SORRY! HELP ME! I-

The men ignore him as Matt makes some gasping sounds, his

eyes going wide.

                    MATT (CONT'D)

          I can...I can hear the singing.

Matt entirely stops moving.   He lays there, not breathing,

completely still.

And then suddenly the two men are flung backwards, as is the

table and the chair. There are a series of grotesque popping

and snapping sounds from Matt's body, and he jerks, and

writhes, pushing himself up onto his hands and knees.

The security cams track and zoom, and as Matt stands, we

realize a startling truth: his cuts are closing themselves.

His broken bones have already molded back into place. His

bruises are shrinking away to nothing.

The blacked out glass suddenly shatters, and falls out of its

frame, revealing a shocked, frightened room of high ranking

military personnel, along with several men in civilian

clothes.

Matt stares at them.   They stare back at him.

                    4-STAR GENERAL

              (terrified)

          Listen...Son, you don't- I mean...

Matt raises a finger to his lips, and the general trails off.

Matt smile weakly for a moment, then stops.

                    MATT

          Would you please...turn off the

          fucking cameras.

                                               CUT TO BLACK.

                                               HOLD ON BLACK

                                               FOR A MOMENT.

FROM INTERNATIONAL NEWS BROADCASTS.

We see a variety of international reporters covering a

breaking story, but only see little clips of each, in

multiple languages. Behind them are various shots of a huge

hydroelectric dam in South Korea.

                    REPORTERS

          -expected to burst at any moment-

          City officials blame the

          malfunctions on the terrorist

          bombing that occurred at the dam's

          control center last March.-

          Botched evacuation has left

          thousands of the Kyo-lee Valley's

          residents trapped, with only one

          major roadway leading in or out. A

          roadway that has not been repaired

          in over ten years- Again, the scale

          here is just unprecedented. Our

          hearts are with people of Kyo-Lee

          tonight.

FROM KIM HAI-SU'S CAMERA.

INT. KIM HAI-SU'S HOUSE

Kim Hai-Su, 17, is behind the camera filming his father, 40s,

as his father hurries to gather his things into a duffle.

Kim Hai-Su's younger brother, 8, wanders into the room,

crying loudly, and Kim's father screams at him to put down

the camera.

                                                     CUT.

They're in the car, driving fast through town. All around we

can see people panicking, and we see two cars collide on the

road up ahead.

                                                     CUT.

They pull up onto an on-ramp, and are immediately trapped

into gridlocked, dead-end traffic. Kim Hai-Su's father

begins shrieking, and banging on the dashboard, which

triggers his younger brother crying again. Kim shouts to

calm down.

                                                     CUT.

Kim is climbing out of the car; people all around are getting

out of their cars, hopelessly trapped. Someone screams, and

Kim turns to reveal an enormous dam several miles away.

                                                        92.

Rubble is falling off the side of an gigantic crack, which

splits further. Kim yells in fear. The crack widens, an

enormous tidal gush of water bursts through, gushing down the

side of the hills into the valley.

Kim's father embraces him, and they have a brief exchange,

when suddenly there's the sound of a sonic boom overhead.

All around them people EXPLODE into cheers. It's not fear,

but rather a kind of frantic ovation. The camera sweeps up,

panning the empty blue sky excitedly, finally coming to rest

on

Matt Garrety.

Looking fucking great as he floats above the freeway. He

pantomimes "yeah, bring it on, cheer louder!" This gets the

intended response, and he pumps a fist shouting "FUCK YEAH

KOREA!"

He turns, pretending to notice the oncoming flood for the

first time, mouths "Oh shit!" Points at the flood casually

as it closes in: "I should deal with this." Another huge

ovation, and Matt smiles widely nods his head "yeahhhhhh!"

and turns.

There's a sonic boom as he goes from zero to mach 4 in less

than a second, rattling the cars on the freeway, disappearing

into the distance over the flood.

After a moment, the impossibly huge onrush of water seems to

stop, slowing and freezing in place, and then...SLOWLY BEGINS

TO REWIND TOWARDS THE DAM.

The camera jerks around wildly as the crowd goes insane,

embracing, kissing, screaming, jumping on their cars. Kim's

father has collapsed into tears of joy next to the car, and

Kim himself is hooting and hollering from the bottom of his

lungs.

The camera comes up to show his little brother, who is going

positively ape-shit on the hood of their car, jumping up and

down, screaming, smiling...

An unearthly, angelic, vibrating chorus of voices starts to

rise, rise, singing and we-
