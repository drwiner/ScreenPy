     INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

     A coffee shop somewhere in New Mexico. MICKEY KNOX, his back

     turned to us, is sitting at the counter finishing his meal. We

     hear the PING...BANG...of a pinball machine being played OFF

     SCREEN.

     MABEL, a waitress, comes over and fills Mickey's coffee cup.

                               MICKEY

                    What kind of pies do you have?

                               MABEL

                    Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.

                               MICKEY

                    Which do you recommend?

                               MABEL

                    The key lime is great, but it's

                    an acquired taste.

                               MICKEY

                    I haven't had a key lime pie in ten

                    years.

                               MABEL

                    When ya had it, did ya like it?

                               MICKEY

                    No, but that don't mean much. I was a

                    completely different person ten years

                    ago. Let's give key lime a day in

                    court. And a large glass of milk.

     Mabel turns to her right.

                               MABEL

                         (to someone O.S.)

                    Should I make that two pieces?

     CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see for the first time MALLORY KNOX,

     Mickey's wife, sitting on a counter stool next to him. Her back

     is to the camera as well.

                               MALLORY

                    Nada, Rosey.

                               MABEL

                         (annoyed)

                    My name's not Rosey.

                         (points at name tag)

                    It's Mabel.

     Mabel exits FRAME.

                               MALLORY

                    Whatever.

     Mallory hops from the stool, walks over and grabs the JAR next

     to the cash register, then dumping out the coins on the counter,

     she selects a quarter.

                               MABEL

                    Hey, what the hell do you think you're

                    doin'?

     Mallory saunters past the COWBOY playing pinball. As his eyes

     follow Mallory, he loses his ball.

     She walks to the jukebox in the back, inserts the quarter,

     selects a song, punches the buttons, a needle lands on a record,

     and a good God almighty rockabilly tune cuts through the coffee

     shop.

     Mabel brings Mickey his pie and milk.

                               MABEL

                         (to Mickey)

                    She ought not be doing that. That's

                    for Jerry's kids, not rock 'n roll.

     CAMERA moves around to a CU of Mickey. This is the first time

     we see him. As he takes a bite of green pie:

                               MICKEY

                    I can't take her anywhere.

     Mallory starts doing a slow seductive fandango around the coffee

     shop. She's really cooking and smoking.

     Pinball Cowboy and Mabel are starting to wonder just who the

     hell these people are.

     Mickey isn't paying much attention. He's too busy enjoying his

     pie and milk.

     EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

     A dirty pickup truck, sporting a Confederate flag decal, pulls

     up to the coffee shop. SONNY, OTIS, and EARL, three

     tough-looking rednecks, pile out. Steam rises from beneath the

     pickup's hood.

                               EARL

                    Goddamn this sumbitch is runnin' hot.

                    Y'all go inside. I'm gonna check 'er

                    out.

     INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

     The LOUDNESS of the Rockabilly song slaps Sonny and Otis in

     their faces as they walk inside the door. The sexy sight of

     Mallory doing the ubang stomp stops them in their tracks.

                               SONNY

                    Good God almighty. What the hell is

                    that?

                               OTIS

                    That's a bitch outta hell, son.

     Otis and Sonny exchange looks.

                               SONNY

                    Take a run at 'er, kiddo.

     Otis heads toward Mallory. Sonny moves over to the counter next

     to Mickey.

                               SONNY

                    Miller, Mabel.

                               MABEL

                    Comin' up.

     Otis stands in front of Mallory, trying to copy what she's

     doing. Her eyes are closed at the moment, so she doesn't see

     him.

     Mabel sets the Miller down in front of Sonny. Sonny takes a

     swig, enjoying the floor show.

                               SONNY

                         (to Mickey)

                    That's some sweet piece of meat, ain't

                    it?

     Mickey turns from his pie and looks at Sonny. His expression

     betrays nothing.

                               MICKEY

                    Her name's Mallory.

     The needle lifts off the record. The song ends.

     Mallory opens her eyes and sees Otis.

                               OTIS

                    Hells Bells! Don't stop now sugar.

                    I'm just getting warmed up.

     Otis gives her his best shit-eating grin before turning to

     Sonny.

     Sonny gurgles out a laugh.

                               SONNY

                    Hey, I think she's sweet on you.

     Otis turns to Mallory as she PUNCHES him hard in the face

     spinning him around.

     Sonny spews his mouthful of Highlife.

     Mallory grabs the back of Otis' head and SMASHES it down on the

     table, cracking the linoleum.

     Otis buckles, dropping to his knees.

     Sonny jumps off the counter stool, but Mickey's hand clutches

     hold of his shoulder.

     Sonny spins around toward Mickey, loaded for bear, and points

     his finger at him, threateningly.

     Before any threat can be made, Mickey whips a large buck knife

     out from its sheath, and in a flash, SLICES off Sonny's finger.

     Sonny's finger drops on his boot. He grabs his aching hand.

     Blood flows from the wound.

                               MICKEY

                    Just because my woman's mopping up the

                    floor with your buddy is no reason for

                    you to join in.

     Mickey makes five lightning quick SLASHING SWINGS. The buck

     knife slips back into its sheath. At first, there seems to be

     no difference with Sonny. Finally, blood flows from the slices

     made in his face and chest. Sonny collapses.

     The SHORT-ORDER COOK charges out of the kitchen at Mickey,

     wielding a meat cleaver and screaming.

     Mickey whips out a .45 automatic from a shoulder holster inside

     his jacket and FIRES.

     BULLET'S POV: Heading fast toward Short-Order Cook's face. It

     HITS. Short-Order Cook puts his hands to his face and falls to

     the ground, screaming.

     Mickey spots Earl, who's standing outside the plate glass

     window. Earl's watched the whole shebang.

     Earl mouths 'Fuck!' He turns and runs for it.

     Mickey hurls the knife through the plate glass window, which

     SHATTERS. The knife PLUNGES deep into Earls back. He hits the

     ground dead.

     Mickey turns to Mallory. She's sitting on op of Otis, SLAMMING

     his head repeatedly on the floor.

                               MICKEY

                    Honey.

     Mallory looks up at Mickey. She gets off Otis and moves to

     Mickey's side.

     Mickey trains his .45 on Pinball Cowboy, who's shaking in his

     cowboy boots. Mickey aims at Mabel, who's clutching the coffee

     pot, crying.

                               MICKEY

                         (to Mallory)

                    Pick one.

     Mallory does eanie, meanie, minie, moe, pointing back and forth

     from Mabel to Pinball Cowboy.

                               MALLORY

                    Eanie, meanie, minie, moe, catch a

                    nigger by the tow. If he hollers, let

                    him go. Eanie, meanie, minie, moe. My

                    mom told me to pick the best one and

                    you are it.

     She ends, pointing at Mabel. Mabel's crying. She screams.

                               MABEL

                    NO!

     Mickey FIRES the .45. The bullet CHINKS through the coffee pot

     Mabel's holding and explodes, THUNKING her in the chest. She

     hits the floor dead.

     Mickey and Mallory join hands and walk over to the Pinball

     Cowboy who stands in a pool of his own urine.

                               MALLORY

                    When you tell people what went on here,

                    tell 'em Mickey and Mallory Knox did

                    this. Understand?

     Pinball Cowboy nods yes.

     The two killers plant a big wet kiss on each other's mouths.

     Then, holding hands, Mickey and Mallory walk out of the cafe.

     INT. COUPE DE VILLE - MOVING - DAY

     Mickey and Mallory in a flashy '68 Cadillac Coupe De Ville.

     Duane Eddy's 'REBEL ROUSER' blares on the soundtrack. The B.G.

     is an outrageous PROCESS SHOT. The titles splash over this

     image 50's style.

     When this sequence is over, we CUT TO BLACK.

     END CREDIT SEQUENCE

     Over black screen, we hear:

                               CAPTAIN SQUERI

                    Send Scagnetti in here.

     INT. POLICE STATION (SQUERI'S OFFICE) - DAY

     CAMERA is position in the middle of the office. The door is in

     the middle of the frame.

     JACK SCAGNETTI flings the door open and steps inside Squeri's

     office. Squeri's never seen.

                               SCAGNETTI

                    You wanted to see me, Capt'n?

                               CAPTAIN SQUERI (O.S.)

                    Scagnetti, go up to interrogation room

                    C. Dewight McClusky, chairman of the

                    prison board, is waiting to meet you.

                    You're gonna deliver two prisoners from

                    the county jail to Nystrom Insane

                    Asylum in Bakersfield.

                               SCAGNETTI

                    This is bullshit. I'm a detective.

                    You want an errand boy, call Jerry

                    Lewis.

     Scagnetti spins around and leaves the room, SLAMMING the door

     shut behind him. Captain Squeri shouts after him.

                               CAPTAIN SQUERI (O.S.)

                    Jack!

     INT. POLICE STATION CORRIDOR - DAY

     Police Detective Scagnetti walks rapidly down the hallway,

     wearing an old, wrinkly, black suit jacket.

     PEOPLE walk by in the F.G. and B.G. Scagnetti slips an already

     tied tie over his head.

     INT. INTERROGATION ROOM C - DAY

     DEWIGHT MCCLUSKY, a man in his fifties, wearing a business suit,

     stands in the F.G. reading a book with his back to the door.

     In the B.G., Scagnetti enters the room.

                               SCAGNETTI

                    Jack Scagnetti. You wanted to see me?

     McClusky turns toward Scagnetti.

                               MCCLUSKY

                    Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case,

                    Scagnetti. You put an end to a

                    nightmare. The ladies of this city can

                    get to sleep again, and they have you

                    to thank.

                               SCAGNETTI

                    Thank you, sir.

                               MCCLUSKY

                    Dewight McClusky of the California

                    Prison Board. Take a seat please.

     Scagnetti lowers into a chair in front of the interrogation

     table.

                               MCCLUSKY

                         (referring to book)

                    This is damn good reading. I'm

                    surprised Hollywood hasn't found you.

                    This would make a better movie than

                    that 'Serpico' shit.

     McClusky puts the book down, we see the title: 'CURTIS FOX: The

     Capture and Death of a Serial Killer'. Author: Jack Scagnetti.

     McClusky sits on the edge of the table, facing Scagnetti. He

     lifts a file off the table, then tosses it in Scagnetti's lap.

                               MCCLUSKY

                    I think you'll find that good reading

                    as well. Mickey and Mallory's file.

                    You familiar with them?

     Scagnetti opens it. It's the files, reports, and photographs

     of Mickey and Mallory Knox. Scagnetti's face lights up.

                               SCAGNETTI

                    Who isn't?

                               MCCLUSKY

                    You been followin' the news coverage?

                               SCAGNETTI

                    They've been separated since their

                    incarceration in a couple of

                    penitentiaries---

                               MCCLUSKY

                    Susanville, Soledade.

                               SCAGNETTI

                    They've killed a shitload of inmates

                    and guards---

                               MCCLUSKY

                    Five inmates, eight guards and one

                    psychiatrist all in one year's time...

                    Very good. You do keep up with the

                    headlines.

     Scagnetti nods.

                               MCCLUSKY

                    Look, our situation in a nutshell is,

                    no prison wants 'em, no prison will

                    take 'em. I'm even talkin' hellholes,

                    where the warden's as hard as a bar of

                    iron. No one wants those fuckin'

                    assholes behind their walls, dealin'

                    with 'em day in, day out.

                               SCAGNETTI

                    I can appreciate that.

                               MCCLUSKY

                    So can we. So the solution to our

                    little problem is we had them deemed

                    crazy. And we're shippin' 'em to

                    Nystrom Asylum for the criminally

                    insane.

                               SCAGNETTI

                    Lobotomy Bay?

                               MCCLUSKY

                    You've heard of it?

                               SCAGNETTI

                    So, how do I fit into this scheme?

                               MCCLUSKY

                    The public loves you Jack...You don't

                    mind if I call you Jack, do you?

                               SCAGNETTI

                    By all means.

                               MCCLUSKY

                    You're a celebrated cop. Twenty-six

                    years on the force, a best-seller out on

                    paperback...

     McClusky grabs Scagnetti's book and reads from the back cover.

                               MCCLUSKY

                    A modern day Pat Garret. A hell bent

                    lawman with a deadly axe to grind with

                    maniacs.

     McClusky lowers the book.

                               MCCLUSKY

                    You're a breathing icon of justice and

                    that's why you were chosen to deliver

                    Mr. and Mrs. Knox. We, the prison

                    board we, knows that once you get them

                    on the road if anything should happen,

                    an escape attempt, an accident, fire,

                    anything...Jack 'Supercop' Scagnetti

                    would be there to look out for his

                    public's best interests.

                               SCAGNETTI

                    I see.

                               MCCLUSKY

                    You write the script Jack, call it,

                    of Mickey and Mallory', whatever...

                    Have we found our man?

     Hold on Scagnetti.

                                                  CUT TO:

     INT. COUNTY JAIL - CELL BLOCK CORRIDOR - DAY

     SCAGNETTI'S POV: McClusky stands next to a big iron door. He

     BANGS on it with is fist. We stay on Scagnetti's POV through

     this scene.

                               MCCLUSKY

                    Pete, open it up! I'm comin' through

                    with a visitor!

     A BUZZER SOUNDS

     McClusky opens the door and we follow him down the corridor. As

     soon as the door opens, we can hear a female voice singing the

     song 'Long Time Woman'.

     McClusky turns to Scagnetti as they walk.

                               MCCLUSKY

                    Well, Jack, I'll tell ya, in all my

                    years with the penal institution, and

                    I'll tell ya that's no small number,

                    Mickey and Mallory Knox are without a

                    doubt the most twisted, depraved group

                    of fucks it's ever been my displeasure

                    to lay my eyes on. I mean, those two

                    rat shits are a walkin' reminder of

                    just how fucked up our system really

                    is.

     The song 'Long Time Woman' is getting louder as they proceed.

                               SCAGNETTI (O.S.)

                    Who's the song bird?

                               MCCLUSKY

                    Mickey's better half herself. Mallory

                    Knox. This little lady drowned her

                    father in a fish tank.

     INSERT: INT. A LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

     CU of a home aquarium with fish swimming around. Suddenly

     Mallory's FATHER'S head is shoved into the tank.

     BACK TO: PRISON CORRIDOR

                               MCCLUSKY

                    While the two together burned her

                    mother alive in her bed.

     INSERT: INT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT

     MEDIUM CU of Mallory's MOTHER lying asleep in bed, mouth open.

     What looks like a gas nozzle appears at the top of the FRAME,

     pouring gasoline all over her face. She coughs and gags.

     CAMERA PANS up and we see Mickey holding a gas can.

     CU of Mallory with a lit match by her face. She tosses it in

     front of her. We hear the SOUNDS of Mallory's mother igniting.

     BACK TO: PRISON CORRIDOR

     Still SCAGNETTI'S POV:

                               SCAGNETTI (O.S.)

                    Why?

     McClusky's still walking ahead of us.

                               MCCLUSKY

                    Because they wouldn't give them their

                    blessing for marriage.

                               SCAGNETTI (O.S.)

                    Ain't love grand.

     McClusky laughs.

                               MCCLUSKY

                    Ain't love grand. That's a good one.

     Still SCAGNETTI'S POV: We look down from McClusky to Mallory's

     file in our hands. It contains her picture and lists her color

     of hair, color of eyes, height, weight, race, etc. Beneath that

     is a column which reads: PSYCHIATRIC REMARKS.

     As we read the remarks, we hear a DOCTOR'S VOICE read aloud.

                               FEMALE PSYCHIATRIST (V.O.)

                    When pressed about the reason for the

                    murders...patient became hostile...

     INSERT: INT. A PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY

     Looking trashy, wild, and animalistic, Mallory's a sex machine

     dressed in a prison gown. She sits in a chair, looking directly

     at the CAMERA.

                               MALLORY

                    I don't owe you an explanation! I don't

                    owe you shit! I'm not here for your

                    entertainment. If I don't tell you

                    what you wanna hear, what are you gonna

                    do? Throw me in jail? I'm already

                    there, you stupid pigfucker. You gonna

                    give me some more time? I've already

                    got life. What else you got to

                    threaten me with? Death? I'd like to

                    see you fuckin' try. I haven't met one

                    motherfucker here who's shown me shit!

     BACK TO DEATH ROW CORRIDOR:

     Still on SCAGNETTI'S POV:

     We look up from the fill and see McClusky's leaning against a

     cell door.

     We hear somebody signing 'Long Time Woman' inside the cell.

     We move to McClusky, who looking into the CAMERA, gestures

     toward the cell.

                               MCCLUSKY

                    Here she is...you know her, you

                    love her, you can't live without

                    her...Mallory Knox.

     We PAN from McClusky to the inside of the cell where we see

     Mallory, her back to us, singing and dancing.

     INT. PRISON (MALLORY KNOX'S CELL) - DAY

     CU of Mallory's face singing 'Long Time Woman'.

                               MALLORY

                         (singing)

                    99 years is a long, long time. Look at

                    me, I will never be free, I'm a long time

                    woman...

                               MCCLUSKY (O.S.)

                    Hey, Knox! Somebody out here wants to

                    meet you.

     Mallory just keeps on truckin'.

                               MALLORY

                         (singing)

                    Been workin' on the road now.

                    Been workin' by the sea.

                    Been workin' in the cane fields.

                    and I wanna be free...

     MALLORY'S POV: We stare at McClusky and Scagnetti for a second.

     Then, like a bull, we charge/DOLLY straight at them. Mallory

     screams O.S. We SMASH headfirst into the bars. Mallory's POV

     flings up, looking at the ceiling, then falls backward.

     MEDIUM TIGHT SHOT of floor, Mallory falls into FRAME, out cold.

     CU on Scagnetti through the cell bars.

                    Jesus Christ!

     CAMERA PANS over to CU on McClusky.

                               MCCLUSKY

                    Don't worry about it. She does that

                    all the time.

     BACK TO: Mallory on the floor, still unconscious with blood

     trickling down her scalp.

                               MCCLUSKY (O.S.)

                    Follow me.

     INT. PRISON (LONG CORRIDOR) - DAY

     CAMERA is at the end of a long corridor. McClusky and Scagnetti

     approach from the other end. Scagnetti's studying the files.

     PHIL WURLITZER comes up behind the two men.

                               WURLITZER

                    You duckin' me Dewight?

                    Hey, Phil, how the hell are ya?

                               WURLITZER

                         (to Scagnetti)

                    This son of a bitch is chairman of the

                    prison board, but it's like pullin'

                    teeth to get him down to a prison.

                               MCCLUSKY

                    The only reason I'm here now is to set

                    him straight, and I'm on the next

                    flight out.

                         (to Scagnetti)

                    Jack, this is the superintendent of the

                    jail. Phil Wurlitzer. He's the man

                    who's got the power of the pen here.

     Wurlitzer shakes hands with Scagnetti.

                               WURLITZER

                    Pleased to meet ya, Jack. I read your

                    book. I'm impressed. Good work on

                    Curtis Fox.

                               SCAGNETTI

                    Thanks.

                    From now on, you'll be dealin' with

                    Phil. He can answer all the questions

                    you got about the arrangements. I'm

                    gonna be bidding you good luck and

                    adieu in about twenty minutes. My

                    flight back to Sacramento leaves LAX in

                    a hour.

                               WURLITZER

                    And I want you to know, we'll all cry a

                    river when you're gone.

     They all laugh.

                               SCAGNETTI

                    What's the travelling arrangements?

                               WURLITZER

                    Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be

                    together. So, we'll put you on one of

                    our prison busses and you'll take

                    Mallory first, then you'll come back

                    for Mickey.

                               SCAGNETTI

                    And where do you keep Mickey?

                               WURLITZER

                    We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest,

                    darkest cell in the whole place. But

                    it just so happens that right now he's

                    got a special visitor.

                               SCAGNETTI

                    Who?

                               WURLITZER

                    Wayne Gayle.

                               SCAGNETTI

                         (surprised)

                    Wayne Gayle!

     INT. JAIL - VISITING AREA - DAY

     WAYNE GAYLE, a young, energetic, commando journalist a'la

     Geraldo Rivera is sitting on the visitor side of the county jail

     visiting area. Wayne is alone and the visiting area is empty.

     Apparently some arrangement was made for the visit. Wayne has a

     miniature tape recorder in his hand and is testing it.

                               WAYNE

                         (into recorder)

                    Testing one...two...three...

                    testing...one...three...over,

                    over, over, Mickey Knox meeting.

     Wayne shuts off the recorder, rewinds and plays it back. It

     works beautifully. He hits the record button and conceals the

     recorder in his sport coat jacket.

     The door opens on the prisoner side and Mickey Knox is lead into

     the room by two SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES. Mickey's wearing the country

     jail blue jump-suit. He has a thick and wide leather belt around

     his waist with a metal ring built into each side. Long sturdy

     chains with handcuffs on each end are wrapped across his body

     and through the rings, binding his arms to his sides. His hands

     and feet are double cuffed.

     The Deputies both have their guns drawn, ready to blow Mickey in

     half at the slightest provocation. For a man wrapped and bound

     in chains, Mickey seems strangely in control of his environment.

     Even restrained as he is by the symbols of society (the chains,

     jail, guards, guns, jump-suit), he remains a dangerous,

     intimidating, and fascinating figure.

     Wayne takes in the image of Mickey.

                               WAYNE

                         (to himself)

                    Showtime.

     Mickey's roughly shoved into his seat on the prisoner's side of

     the glass. The Deputies move to their place, off to the side by

     the wall.

                               WAYNE

                    Hello Mickey. We've never been

                    introduced, but I'm Wayne Gayle. I

                    don't know if you've ever heard of me

                    or remember me. I was one of the

                    reporters outside the courthouse during

                    your trial---

                               MICKEY

                    Everybody knows who you are. You're

                    famous.

     Wayne pauses and retorts.

                               WAYNE

                    I could say the same thing about you.

                         (smiles)

                    I want to thank you very much for

                    seeing me...

     Mickey is silent.

                               WAYNE

                    I have a television show. It's very

                    popular. Every week we do a profile on

                    a different serial killer. You don't

                    mind if I call you a serial killer, do

                    you?

     Mickey shakes his head no.

                               WAYNE

                    The episode we did on Mickey and

                    Mallory was one of our most popular ones.

                               MICKEY

                    Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?

                               WAYNE

                    Yes.

                               MICKEY

                    Whose ratings were higher?

                               WAYNE

                    Yours.

                               MICKEY

                    How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on

                    him?

                               WAYNE

                    Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.

                               MICKEY

                    Good...yuppie piece of shit.

                               WAYNE

                    What I'd like to do---

                               MICKEY

                    How 'bout Manson?

                               WAYNE

                    Manson beat you.

                               MICKEY

                    Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the

                    king.

                               WAYNE

                    We've been waiting to do a follow up

                    episode on you for a long time. And

                    that time has definitely come.

                         (pause)

                    I feel it's apparent to anyone who's

                    hip to what's going on that the prison

                    board has thrown the constitution

                    straight out the fuckin' window.

                    You and Mallory may be killers, but

                    you're not insane. You belong in a

                    prison, not in an asylum. The prison

                    board is blatantly railroading you into

                    a hospital for the sole purpose of

                    turning you into vegetables. Now some

                    people are saying, 'So what?' I am not

                    one of those people. If we avert our

                    eyes while they do this to you, we give

                    them permission to do it again whenever

                    they see fit. Today they wipe clean

                    your mind because they feel your

                    actions are dangerous, tomorrow they

                    wipe clean my mind because they feel

                    what I say is dangerous. Where does

                    it all stop?

     No response from Mickey.

                               WAYNE

                    My problem Mickey, is that you don't

                    exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone

                    on this. I need your help. I want

                    what the prison board is doing to be

                    the focus of our follow up episode.

                    Now I have interviews with chairman of

                    the prison board Dewight McClusky about

                    this issue. And I'm tellin' ya,

                    Mickey, he looks bad. The two

                    psychologists they used for their

                    psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk

                    to us, which always looks bad. I have

                    an interview with both the judge of

                    your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the

                    psychologist and author, Emil

                    Reinghold, both of which discount the

                    notion that you're insane. You put

                    that all together, and what the state

                    is doing becomes obvious. But the

                    network isn't satisfied. They feel the

                    show needs another element. It needs

                    you. In order to put the show on the

                    air, I need to get an interview with

                    you. You haven't talked to the press

                    since your trial. Now, a few days

                    before you get transferred to an

                    asylum, you grant an interview on

                    television with Wayne Gayle. We're

                    talkin' a media event here. Every son

                    of a bitch out the with a TV set's

                    gonna tune in to see that.

                    We'll make their motives so blatant,

                    we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole

                    thing. At least for a little while,

                    the publicity would keep them from just

                    giving you and Mallory lobotomies.

                    Well, whatta ya say?

                               MICKEY

                    Have you talked to Mallory about this?

                               WAYNE

                    She won't even see me, Mickey. Now

                    you're not supposed to know anything

                    about what's going on with her, but I'm

                    gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you

                    two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't

                    spoken one word.

                               MICKEY

                    She doesn't talk?

                               WAYNE

                    Not to anybody. She sings.

                               MICKEY

                    She sings? What does she sing?

                               WAYNE

                    Songs. 'He's A Rebel', 'Leader Of The

                    Pack', 'Town Without Pity', that Dusty

                    Springfield song 'I Only Want To Be

                    With You'. That's what I hear anyway.

                    Her behaviour was the main thing the

                    doctors' report used against you. So

                    even if she would see me, which she

                    won't, I couldn't put her on camera

                    anyway. If I ask her, 'Mallory, are

                    you insane?' And she starts singing

                    'Dead Skunk In The Middle Of The Road',

                    that blows our whole case.

     Mickey cracks a smile.

     The guards come over to take him away.

                               DEPUTY SHERIFF (O.S.)

                    Time, motherfucker!

     They grab Mickey, and jerk him from the chair. Wayne stands.

                               WAYNE

                    Wait a minute, Mickey, I need an

                    answer.

     Mickey doesn't respond. He just leaves with the guards.

                               WAYNE

                         (yells after him)

                    Just think about it. But don't think

                    too long.

     INT. MICKEY'S CELL - DAY

     MEDIUM CU of Mickey curled up by his bed, writing Mallory a

     letter.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)

                    Dearest Mallory. My cell is so cold.

                    At night I get the chills. I pretend

                    you're lying next to me, holding me

                    from behind with your leg draped over

                    mine and your arms wrapped tightly

                    around me. I lie in my cell...

     DISSOLVE TO:

     WIDE SHOT in cell behind Mickey. We slowly DOLLY back.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)

                    ...and imagine kissing you. Not

                    making love, just kissing for hours and

                    hours on end. I remember everything

                    about our time. I remember every joke

                    you ever told.

     CU of the letter being written over the WIDE SHOT.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)

                    I remember every secret you ever

                    shared. Shared or revealed? I think

                    shared is proper. I remember every

                    single time you laughed.

     ECU of Mickey, mouthing the words as he writes, we can hear

     Mallory's laugh - a distant haunting echo.

                               MICKEY

                    I remember every meal we ever ate. I

                    remember your cooking. I especially

                    remember your casseroles. I remember

                    watching David Letterman.

     We hear the echo of television laughter.

                               MICKEY

                    I remember driving fast...faster,

                    man, fast behind the wheel of the Coupe

                    de Ville.

     The sound of the Coupe de Ville swells until we...

                                                  CUT TO:

     EXT. COUPE DE VILLE - NIGHT

     CAMERA sits on the hood looking down at Mickey and Mallory,

     driving fast -- SLOW MOTION. A hurricane of wind whips through

     their hair. Mallory laughs wildly as she wraps her arms around

     Mickey and kisses.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)

                    You, baby, by my side. Your bare feet

                    up on the dash, singing along with the

                    radio 'Needles And Pins', 'He's A

                    Rebel', 'You're My World', 'Ring Of

                    Fire', 'Love Grows Where My Rosemary

                    Goes', 'Groove Me'...

     EXT. COUPE DE VILLE - NIGHT

     Coupe de Ville parked on the road side. Mickey is in the

     drivers seat with his feet on the dash watching Mallory dance on

     the hood of the car.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)

                    And your dancing, my God, your dancing.

                    I lie on my bed and go over every day,

                    every minute of our happiness. Every

                    day take a day of our time and go

                    through it hour by hour. I don't jump

                    ahead either. I take it as it comes,

                    and I live that day again. That way

                    when I get to our first kiss...

     INT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT

     The screen erupts with fire. Mickey and Mallory's faces appear

     in the flame kissing passionately.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)

                    The killing of your parents, our

                    wedding...They're not just memories.

                    I feel that joy again...

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

     MEDIUM CU of Wayne holding a piece of paper in front of his face

     and reading from it out loud. We hear Wayne's VOICE over

     Mallory's singing before the last scene DISSOLVES.

                               WAYNE

                         (reading out loud)

                    'After taking a few days to reflect on

                    your offer, I've come to the conclusion

                    that you are one hundred percent

                    correct. A national TV interview would

                    be very advantageous to both Mallory

                    and I. The only obstacle is they're

                    shipping me out to the funny farm in

                    four days. However, that is your

                    problem and not mine. I feel confident

                    you'll manage. Here's to us making

                    television history. Sincerely, Mickey

                    Knox.'

     Wayne drops the letter down from in front of his face.

                               WAYNE

                    Am I a God or what?

     We now see the restaurant adorned with the standard Denny's

     decorum. Wayne's team is gathered in a booth that surrounds the

     remains of a greasy meal. In response to his last remark, they

     all pretend they are praying to him.

     The team consists of SCOTT, the cameraman, who wears wild

     t-shirts (presently a t-shirt with the movie 'She Devils On

     Wheels' splashed on the front); ROGER, the soundman, who wears

     wild Hawaiian shirts and Bermuda shorts; and UNRULY JULIE,

     Wayne's assistant, a young lady who wears Bermuda shorts, a

     baseball jersey, and a dark sports coat no matter how hot the

     weather is at any time. Roger's never seen without his

     recorder, Scott's never without his camera, and Unruly Julie

     always has her giant notebook. These dishevelled film types are

     all in their twenties and are a marked contrast to Wayne's

     stylish yuppie demeanour.

     Unruly Julie pops the cork on a champagne bottle. The guys hold

     out coffee mugs, while Julie fills. Julie, however drinks

     straight from the bottle.

     NOTE: This scene is to be played at a rapid fire 'His Girl

     Friday' pace.

                               WAYNE

                    Drink up! This is a celebration. This

                    is the day we received word we were

                    gonna make television history. We're

                    gonna have the first sit down, in depth

                    interview with the most charismatic

                    serial killer ever, one day before he's

                    being shipped to a mental hospital for

                    the rest of his life. This is one of

                    those golden moments that happens maybe

                    only four times in a lucky journalist's

                    career. This is Wallace with Noriega,

                    this is Elton John confessing his

                    bi-sexuality to the Rolling Stone, this

                    is the tearful reporting of the

                    Hindenberg disaster, this is Truffaut

                    setting the record straight on

                    Hitchcock, this is a Robert Capa photo,

                    this is Woodward and Bernstien meeting

                    Deep Throat in an underground parking

                    lot, this is John Reid reporting 'The

                    Ten Days That Shook The World', this is

                    the hippies' bloody palms at Kent

                    State, the Maysles brothers at

                    Altamont, this is the Nixon/Frost

                    interviews...

                               ROGER

                    This is Raymond Burr witnessing the

                    destruction of Tokyo by Godzilla.

     Everybody laughs.

                               SCOTT

                    What's the schedule, mein fuehre?

     As Wayne talks, Unruly Julie writes furiously in her notebook.

     She never speaks, just writes.

                               WAYNE

                    We got tonight and tomorrow to get our

                    shit together. The day after that

                    they're shippin' Mallory. That's when

                    we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause

                    the next day he goes.

                               SCOTT

                    Would the network really not run it

                    without the interview?

                               WAYNE

                    Are you kidding? The last thing they

                    expected was Mickey Knox to get up

                    close and personal. They wanted a

                    follow up episode and would've taken

                    anything I had given them. I'm not

                    gonna tell Mickey Knox that. I'm gonna

                    make him think his grey matter depends

                    on it. When I told Woody and the brass

                    about this coup, they practically shit

                    a brick. I'm talkin' an adobe brick.

                    They want to expand the show to a hour,

                    and they want it on immediately.

                               ROGER

                    How immediate is immediately?

                               WAYNE

                    Next week's episode.

     Wayne's team all spit out mouthfuls of champagne.

                               ROGER

                    We don't got enough footage for a hour

                    follow up.

                               SCOTT

                         (pointing at Roger)

                    What he said.

                               WAYNE

                    Rape and pillage the first episode,

                    just change the order a bit. Those

                    sons of bitches out there ain't gonna

                    know the difference. All that shit is

                    just filler for the interview anyway.

                    We film a new intro. Show some old

                    footage from the first episode so the

                    get a brief history of Mickey and

                    Mallory. We introduce a new angle...

                    what the prison board is up to. We

                    see some of that new shit, then the

                    rest of the show is the interview. Now

                    what's so fuckin' hard about that? Oh,

                    Julie make a note: I need Woody to get

                    me thirty seconds of the 'Live at Five'

                    broadcast to promote next weeks show.

                    We'll do a feed right from the jail

                    while we're wrapping up with Mickey.

     Unruly Julie scribbles in her notebook. Wayne snaps at Scott.

                               WAYNE

                    You too Scott, Betacam and a remote,

                    keep it simple.

     Scott closes his eyes in concentration, and repeats Wayne.

                               SCOTT

                    footage, put it together, and see what

                    we got. Get it into shape so when we

                    At that point I'll ask him if he

                    believes in God. If he says yes, I'll

                    ask him what he thinks God would make

                    of his actions. And is he worried

                    about burning in hell? If he says no,

                    I'll say, 'Well, Mickey, what do you

                    believe in?' And hopefully he'll say

                    something like a live round of ammo,

     STEVO, the other store clerk, walks in from the back room

     carrying boxes and wearing a walkman.

     Mickey and Mallory spin around and shoot him.

                    The Mickey and Mallory Knox murder

                    trial was so event filled it made the

                    crime spree that took place before pale

                    by comparison. The first point was the

                    decision of Mickey's to act as his own

                    council. Now this in itself is not

                    unheard of, for instance, Ted Bundy

                    acted as his own council as well. What

                    was unexpected was how well Mickey's

                    Mickey was surprisingly effective.

                    When I was told I was to be the judge

                    of this trial and then I was told

                    Mickey Knox would be handling his own

                    defence, I got a headache that lasted

                    five days. But at first I breathed a

                    sigh of relief. Mickey showed up very

                    prepared, and proved to be an excellent

     Interview with state prosecutor WANDA BISBING, an attractive

     woman in her forties.

                               WAYNE (V.O.)

                    However, this opinion isn't shared by

                    the state's prosecutor on this case,

                    Wanda Bisbing.

     Wayne's with Bisbing.

                               WAYNE

                    Judge Steinsma said that Mickey showed

                    up very prepared and proved to be an

                    excellent amateur attorney.

                               BISBING

                    Oh, that's rich. Well, considering

                    that Mickey Knox turn his court into

                    a mockery and personally made him look

                    like a fool, I'd say that's very

                    benevolent of Judge Steinsma. As far

                    as Mickey being an excellent amateur

                    lawyer, maybe I'm old fashioned, but

                    when I went to law school, we were

                    taught the object was to win the case,

                    which I did.

                    The nation caught fire to Mickey and

                    Mallory fever, Mickey and Mallory

                    mania, if you will, as the merits to

                    Mickey's talent as a defence attorney

                    became apparent.

                    Law students from all ends of the

                    country converged on Los Angeles as

                    legal history took a new course. But

                    that was only the lemon next to the

                    pie. And that pie is you, the American

                    people. That pie is the way the

                    strangely charismatic, and make no

                    mistake, they are charismatic, Mickey

                    and Mallory have captured the public's

                    interest, fear, and in some cases,

                    admiration.

                    two shit asses (BLEEP) the stiffest

                    sentence the law allows. I want to see

                    their faces when the state says 'they

                    are the worst scum sucking, degenerate,

                    is who these misguided assholes (BLEEP)

                    should be revering. You know why Mike

                    Jerome Griffin is a hero? I'll tell ya

                    why. Because he was killed in the line

                    of duty. Do you want to know how he

                    died?

                    conquers that of master Melvin Belli.

                    But how can you say that?

                               SIMON

                    They're mesmerising.

                               NORMAN

                    Hypnotizing.

                               SIMON

                               WAYNE

                               NORMAN

                    And a snake-eye glare.

                    ---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was

                    able to totally psyche out any

                    confidence Ferigno had.

                               NORMAN

                    He squashed him mentally before

                    physically defeating him.

                               SIMON

                    He had the edge. The mind's edge.

                               NORMAN

                    Mickey and Mallory have that edge.

                    Schwartzenegger was the king of the

                    both victims of Mickey and Mallory.

                               NORMAN

                    It's like this, Wayne. Two people are

                    standing in a dark room waiting for the

                    other to attack. These two people

                    can't see each other, yet they know

                    they're there. Now, they can either

                    stand in the dark room forever waiting

                    until they die of boredom, or one of

                    them can make the first move.

                               WAYNE

                    Why can't they just shake hands and be

                    friends?

                               NORMAN

                    They can't because neither knows if the

                    other is a deranged senseless killer

                    like the Knoxs. So, you may as well

                    make the first move.

                               WAYNE

                    And they made the first move?

                               NORMAN

                    Unfortunately, yes.

                               SIMON

                    But you see, that's okay, Wayne.

                               WAYNE

                    Why?

                               SIMON

                    They passed the 'edge' along to us.

                               WAYNE

                    How so?

                               SIMON

                    By taking away our legs. Now we have

                    to fight harder to get ahead than

                    anyone else you'll find in this gym.

                    Probably the whole city. They gave us

                    the fighting spirit. Before this

                    happened I was content. Now I'm pissed

                    off. Now I'm half a man and I've got

                    to work like the devil to get whole

                    again.

                               WAYNE

                    But you'll never be whole again.

                               SIMON

                    Never is a very long time, Wayne. A

                    word only the weak use. I'm not a sore

                    loser. Even if I don't have a leg to

                    stand on, I'm going to get up and fight

                    this world until I'm on top again.

                               NORMAN

                    That's the Mickey and Mallory way.

                               SIMON

                    That's the way of the world.

                               NORMAN

                    They're shocking the world into

                    remembering the primal law.

                               SIMON

                    Survival of the fittest.

                               WAYNE

                    One last question. Usually Mickey and

                    Mallory kill all of their victims. Why

                    did they let you two survive?

     The brothers pause, then turn to Wayne.

                               NORMAN

                    They had us tied down during one of

                    their house raids, you've seen the

                    headlines, and they were taking a

                    chainsaw to our legs before they were

                    gonna kill us.

                               SIMON

                    Just for fun, I guess.

                               NORMAN

                    And then Mallory stops Mickey and says,

                    'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'

                               SIMON

                    Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says,

                    'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'

                               NORMAN

                    So, Mallory calls 911 and they took

                    off.

                    We talked with Neil Pope, writer and

                    take on the Mickey and Mallory

                    phenomena.

     Pope stops the movieola, turns toward the CAMERA, and greets

     Wayne M.O.S.

     CUT INTO INTERVIEW:

                               NEIL POPE

                    It is my belief that Mickey and Mallory

                    Knox are a cultural phenomena that

                    could only exist in our sexually

                    repressed society. A flower that could

                    only bloom amidst a grotesque fast food

                    culture. A what I tried to do with

                    'Thrill Killers' was trace the root of

                    the problem all the way down the vine

                    to the original bad seed. Yet amidst

                    the violence and murder and carnage,

                    you've got the structure of a Wagnerian

                    love story.

     EXT. ALLEY - DAY

     In a back alley, the conclusion of 'Thrill Killers' plays out.

     The sound of SIRENS and CHOPPERS are nearing. Movie Mickey,

     shotgun in hand, runs down the alley stopping at a dumpster,

     where the wounded and bloody Movie Mallory sits propped up

     against a brick wall. On the bottom of the SCREEN, the

     subtitle appears: SCENE FROM 'THRILL KILLERS' (1990).

                               MOVIE MALLORY

                    Mickey, honey, listen to me.

     Movie Mallory holds out her hand for him to take it. He does.

                               MOVIE MALLORY

                    I can't go. I'm too fucked up.

                               MOVIE MICKEY

                    I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt,

                    but--

                               MOVIE MALLORY

                    I can't run with you, Mickey! I really

                    want to. If I could, I would, but I

                    can't. I gotta stay here. But you can

                    still get out of here.

                               MOVIE MICKEY

                    No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!

                               MOVIE MALLORY

                    If they stay, they'll catch you, and

                    they don't have to catch you---

                               MOVIE MICKEY

                    No fuckin' way!

                               MOVIE MALLORY

                    Mickey, you're wasting time!

                               MOVIE MICKEY

                    I don't give a damn if a million United

                    States marines, all whistling the halls

                    of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin'

                    down this alley any second. There

                    ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm

                    leaving you. And that's that!

     Movie Mallory grabs his hand with both of hers. She's crying.

     The SIREN and CHOPPER sounds are getting closer.

                               MOVIE MALLORY

                    Mickey, my love, if you leave me,

                    they'll catch me and take me to the

                    hospital. If you stay, you'll make 'em

                    kill you. Then it'd be like I killed

                    you. I could bear anything, but I

                    couldn't bear that. So please, please,

                    for me, my handsome

                    husband, run for your life.

     The SIRENS and CHOPPERS draw closer.

                               MOVIE MICKEY

                    I can't do it. You're my wife, you're

                    my partner. A fella doesn't run when

                    his partner can't run with him.

                    Mallory, my angel, if I could of left

                    ya, I'd of left ya a long time ago.

     They kiss.

                               MOVIE MALLORY

                    Well, hell, if you won't leave, give me

                    a gun so I can go out shooting.

     Movie Mickey hands her his .44 Magnum from his belt.

                               MOVIE MICKEY

                    Sit tight. I'm gonna make it a little

                    tougher for 'em.

     Movie Mickey runs to the end of the alley, peers around the

     corner at the arriving COPS.

                               MOVIE MICKEY

                         (to himself)

                    Time to get naked and boogie.

     Movie Mallory is out of movie Mickey's view. She cocks the .44,

     then places the barrel under her chin.

                               MOVIE MALLORY

                    Mickey!

     Movie Mickey's busy. He doesn't turn around.

                               MOVIE MICKEY

                    Yeah baby.

                               MOVIE MALLORY

                    You made every day like kindergarten.

     Movie Mallory pulls the trigger. BANG!

     DOLLY down the alley to a CU on Mickey as he spins around.

     Movie Mallory literally blew her head clean off. Her headless

     body, gun in hand, remains upright in her sitting position.

     Movie Mickey runs toward her, screaming her name in SLOW MOTION.

                               MOVIE MICKEY

                    Mallory!

     BACK TO: THE POPE INTERVIEW

                               WAYNE (O.S.)

                    Why did you kill Mallory? Both of

                    them are still alive.

                               NEIL POPE

                    It was dramatic license, no doubt. But

                    I felt an operatic love story needed an

                    operatic ending. The two of them kill

                    for each other. They offer the death

                    of their victims to each other like

                    other lovers offer flowers or bon bons.

                    So what more natural, what more

                    organic, what more poetic than Mallory

                    offering her death to Mickey? It's

                    where it's been leading since day one.

                    We worked it in the movie by using a

                    what if they escaped situation. I

                    think it works beautifully. You'd be

                    surprised. People come up to me at the

                    end of the movie in tears.

     EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

     Actor JESSIE ALEXANDER WARWICK sits on his motorcycle and talks

     to the CAMERA. He's dressed in a Levi's jacket, jeans, a bandanna

     is wrapped around his head, and as he talks he bogarts a smoke.

     His name appears at the bottom of the SCREEN.

                               JESSIE

                    One thing about Mickey for sure, he's

                    definitely a man who has his moments.

                    It was wild playin' him. It was one of

                    those get-it-out-of-your-system

                    performances.

     INT. BUFFY ST. MCQUEEN'S HOME - DAY

     This interview is SHOT in Buffy's house a'la Barbara Walters.

     BUFFY sits on the couch in her living room with a cat in her

     lap. From time to time, she sips from a coffee cup. Her name

     appears at the bottom of the SCREEN.

                               BUFFY

                    I didn't play Mallory, the murderer. I

                    didn't play her as a butcher. I played

                    her as a woman in love, who also

                    happens to murder people. I didn't

                    want her to be at arm's length from the

                    audience or myself. If you play her as

                    this wild maniac, the audience never

                    has to deal with her. If you see a

                    decapitation in a movie, you just say

                    'Oh wow, a neat special effect.'

                    Because you can't relate to a

                    decapitation. It doesn't mean anything

                    to anybody because it's not personal.

                    Decapitations don't fall into most

                    people's realm of life experiences.

                    But if you show somebody in a movie

                    getting a paper cut, the whole audience

                    squirms. Because everybody can relate

                    to a paper cut.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)

                    Did you meet the real Mallory Knox?

                               BUFFY

                    I tried to, but she wouldn't see me.

                    But I read some letters she wrote to

                    Mickey before the murder spree. They

                    helped me out a lot.

     EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

                    Yeah, I visited him when he was up in

                    Susanville. He's a little cerebral for

                    my taste, but all in all, we got along.

     INT. OFFICE - DAY

     Wayne, sitting in a chair in front of a desk, interviews DR.

     REINGHOLD, who sits behind the desk.

                               WAYNE (V.O.)

                    To get a psychiatric view on the

                    strange attraction Mickey and Mallory

                    seems to have, we talked with Doctor

                    Emil Reinghold, noted psychologist and

                    author.

     Wayne begins his interview.

                               WAYNE

                    Can you shed some light, Doctor

                    Reinghold, on why the public has taken

                    a pair of sociopaths so close to their

                    bosom?

                               DR. REINGHOLD

                    Well, for one, the media has done a

                    tremendous job of turning the husband

                    and wife mass murderers into

                    celebrities. But it's the country's

                    youth who have turned the couple into

                    the ultimate anti-heroes. Basically,

                    the very thing that makes them most

                    lethal is the exact same thing that

                    captures the public's hearts and

                    minds -- Mickey and Mallory's operatic

                    devotion to each other. In a world

                    where people can't seem to make the

                    simplest relationships work and the

                    slightest emotional commitment is

                    considered devastating, Mick and

                    Mallory have a do-or-die romance of a

                    Shakespearean magnitude. To the

                    country's youth, 75 percent of which

                    are coming from broken homes, that's

                    appealing. They have an 'us against

                    the world' posture which always appeals

                    to youth. And they've taken that

                    posture seventeen steps beyond.

                    It's not 'us against the world,' it's

                    'we're gonna kill the world.' They're

                    exciting. I read their file and I find

                    myself turning the page like it was a

                    paperback. Why do disillusioned youths

                    get into Mickey and Mallory? Why do

                    disillusioned housewives read romance

                    novels? Why are you filming this

                    special? Because you know as well as I

                    do, you say 'tonight at nine Charles

                    Manson speaks,' everybody's going to

                    tune in to hear what he says. Mickey

                    and Mallory have shocked a country numb

                    with violence. They've created a world

                    where only two exist and anybody who

                    inadvertently enters that world is

                    murdered.

                    seventeen year old Grace Mulberry was

                    the lucky one left to tell the tale.

                    And this haunted young lady summoned up

                    the courage to take the stand, tell

                    what she saw that horrible night, and

                    then allow herself to be cross-examined

                    by the man who killed her brother and

                    girlfriends.

     All kinds of PEOPLE are gathered around. It's a real media

     event.

     Grace's sedan pulls up to the courthouse. The many spectators

     and reporters surround the car.

     Grace, HER FATHER, and BISBING emerge from the sedan, and start

     walking up the courthouse steps.

     Microphones and cameras are thrust at her as REPORTERS ask

     questions.

     Grace is afraid to face the crowd. Her head darts in the

     direction of each question, but she doesn't answer.

     She remains silent and scared.

     Mickey and Mallory pulls up. The reporters race down the steps

     they just raced up. The Mickey and Mallory fans go apeshit.

     Mickey and Mallory, handcuffed, are being led up the steps by

     SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES. Wayne Gayle and other reporters film them

                    I'd like to talk about Tim's martial

                    arts abilities. How long had he been

                    studying?

                               MICKEY

                    When you study the martial arts, they

                    give out belts that come in different

                    colors to signify what level you're at

                    in your training. Am I correct on that

                    point?

                               GRACE

                    Yes you are.

                               MICKEY

                    What was the color of Tim's belt?

                               GRACE

                    The style of fighting that Tim studied

                    didn't believe in belts.

                               MICKEY

                    Is that a fact? Well then, Grace,

                    could you tell us what form of martial

                    arts it was that Tim was schooled in?

                               GRACE

                    Tim studied several styles, but his

                    favorite was Jeet Kune Do.

                               MICKEY

                    Jeet Kune Do...Now I did some research

                    on that form of fighting, and I found

                    out that Jeet Kune Do was a style

                    developed by Bruce Lee. Did you know

                    that?

                               GRACE

                    Yes, I did. That's why Tim studied it.

                    Because it was Bruce Lee's fighting

                    style.

     CU of COURT CLERK'S HANDS typing in SLOW MOTION.

                               MICKEY

                    Now, while I freely admit total

                    ignorance on the subject, I have heard

                    of Bruce Lee. And I was under the

                    impression that Bruce Lee was one of

                    the, if not 

the

 greatest fighter in the

                    history of martial arts.

                               GRACE

                    That's what Tim said.

                               MICKEY

                    So, I think it would be safe to say

                    that anybody who studied the fighting

                    style that Bruce Lee, arguably the

                    greatest martial artist of all times,

                    developed for nine years, that would be

                    a fella who could defend himself.

                    Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?

                               GRACE

                    Yes, I would.

                               MICKEY

                    Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands

                    registered as lethal weapons?

                               MICKEY

                    That means his hands are considered a

                    weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I

                    correct on that point?

                    courtroom, the judge, honorable Burt

                    Steinsma, passed down a sentence that

                    was to make legal history.

     INT. JUDGE'S DEN - DAY

     Interview with Judge Steinsma in his den at home.

     M.O.S. SHOT of Wayne and Judge talking.

                               WAYNE (V.O.)

                    We spoke with retired Judge Steinsma at

                    his home in Baltimore, Maryland.

     The interview:

                               WAYNE

                    Was there any vengeance on your part

                    with your unique sentence?

                               JUDGE STEINSMA

                    Yes, unquestionably. After they did

                    what they did in my court, and judge

                    worth his robe will tell you the same

                    thing. It couldn't help but affect my

                    decision. That's why they have judges.

                    We're supposed to be fair to a fault,

                    but when it's showtime, we have to make

                    a decision. That's why we don't just

                    input all the facts into a computer for

                    the appropriate punishment. I couldn't

                    give them the death penalty. See,

                    California hops back and forth on that

                    issue. Mickey and Mallory went to

                    court when it was out of favor, which

                    is actually good because it leaves more

                    room for imagination. Anybody can give

                    somebody the chair. When you have

                    someone who deserves to die and you

                    can't kill them, you have to be

                    creative. And if the bastards had let

                    it stand, it would of been the perfect

                    sentence. It hit 'em right where they

                    lived. Far more punishing than the

                    death sentence.

                               WAYNE

                    Would you please describe for our

                    viewers what your sentence was?

                               JUDGE STEINSMA

                    Well, in a rogue's gallery of killers,

                    Mickey and Mallory are very unique.

                    I've seen a lot of killers in my day

                    and they're a very cold lot. They have

                    no more feelings about taking a

                    person's life than squashing a tiny

                    bug. It's all the same to them. Well,

                    Mickey and Mallory were that 'kill 'em

                    to watch their expression change'

                    attitude personified. Except with each

                    other. And, since they lived only for

                    each other, I wanted to attack that, at

                    its very root. So, in a nutshell, my

                    sentence was double life for each

                    without any possibility for parole.

                    That would be fairly standard in their

                    case. The twist I added was that the

                    husband and wife would have no contact

                    or correspondence with each other for

                    the rest of their lives. And they

                    would never receive any word or

                    information about the other.

                    So, basically once the cell door slams

                    shut, Mickey and Mallory will

                    completely disappear from each other's

                    life. They'll never know when the

                    other dies. But alas, the best laid

                    plans of mice and men...

                    The sentence was never to reach that

                    point. Because after only a year,

                    Mickey and Mallory created so much

                    mayhem that it was decided...

                    We talked with Dewight McClusky,

                    chairman of the California State Prison

                    Board, about this curious turn of

                    events in the Mickey and Mallory case.

     INT. MCCLUSKY'S OFFICE - DAY

     Wayne's interviewing McClusky.

                               WAYNE

                    Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved

                    to an asylum? And who made the

                    decision?

                               MCCLUSKY

                    The prison board made the decision. A

                    board of which I belong. We're the

                    who. The why is simple. Mickey and

                    Mallory are mentally ill and need to be

                    under a doctor's care, where hopefully

                    they'll receive the help they need.

                               WAYNE

                    Mickey and Mallory were deemed

                    competent in a mental examination

                    before their trial. I'm confused.

                    What's changed?

                               MCCLUSKY

                    Well, since that time, they've killed

                    one person during their trail. And

                    since their incarceration, they've

                    killed one psychologist along with

                    several guards and inmates.

                               WAYNE

                    When they were found competent before,

                    they had already killed fifty people.

                    Other than the fact they're a

                    disciplinary problem, which frankly

                    shouldn't surprise anyone, I still

                    don't see where this situation is any

                    different then it was before. So, I

                    ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's

                    changed?

                               MCCLUSKY

                    What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our

                    minds. We felt they were competent a

                    year ago. A year has passed, sir, a

                    year where they were under close

                    observation, day in and day out, and

                    their behaviour has led us to believe we

                    were wrong.

                               WAYNE

                    Who is we?

                               MCCLUSKY

                    The prison board and the doctors who

                    examined them.

                               WAYNE

                    Were any of the doctors who made the

                    first evaluation on the Knoxs mental

                    state asked to re-examine them?

                               MCCLUSKY

                    Using the same doctors is not common

                    practice.

                               WAYNE

                    I take it by your answer it was a whole

                    new team?

                               MCCLUSKY

                    Now that you bring it up, yes. They

                    were different men. I hadn't really

                    thought that much about it. Since many

                    psychiatric opinions are, by a rule,

                    sought out for this kind of situation.

                    What do you think normally happens?

                    The Knoxs are assigned a family

                    psychologist that takes care of them

                    throughout the rest of their lives?

                    The state doesn't work like that.

                    sought were those of Albert

                    good doctors, for whatever reason,

                    refused to be interviewed.

     INT. DR. REINGHOLD'S OFFICE - DAY

     Back with Dr. Reinghold. He's laughing.

                               DR. REINGHOLD

                    It's a funny situation actually. If

                    anyone besides Mickey and Mallory give

                    a damn, what the prison board is doing

                    would be considered an outrage. The

                    prison board is basically saying, 'We

                    can't handle these guys.' They've

                    moved 'em around twice since their

                    sentence started.

                    They were a handful everywhere they

                    went. Now the prisons they're at now

                    want them outta there. But no other

                    prison's gonna be stupid enough to take

                    'em. So the prison board is left

                    scratching their heads wondering what

                    they're gonna do. Well, what they

                    decided to do was to set up a kangaroo

                    medical court that found them crazy.

                    Then they get them transferred to

                    Nystrom Medical Asylum or Lobotomy Bay

                    as it's referred to in the psychiatric

                    circle. Put 'em on a strict dope and

                    electro shock diet, and Mickey and

                    Mallory cease to be a problem to

                    anybody except the orderlies who clean

                    out the bedpans, which if you want to

                    see them get theirs, that's all well

                    and good. But there's something being

                    said here. Forget the immorality for a

                    second. Forget the corruption and the

                    skulduggery involved. What the board

                    is saying is 'we give up.' Mickey and

                    Mallory ran amuck in polite society.

                    They were put in an alternative society

                    and they ran amuck there, too. All the

                    powers that be, can't deal with these

                    two kids. And whatever can't be

                    assimilated has to be terminated.

                               WAYNE

                    So, in your opinion Mickey and Mallory

                    are not insane?

                               DR. REINGHOLD

                    Insane, no. Psychotic, yes. A menace

                    to living creatures, yes. But to

                    suggest that they're insane gives the

                    impression that they don't know right

                    from wrong. Mickey and Mallory know

                    the difference between right and wrong.

                    They just don't give a damn.

     Scott and Roger's shoulders.

                    Good work, my brothers. Fan-fuckin'-

                    tastic! I think that interview stuff's

                    too long, we can lose some of that.

                    Keep the girls, keep the long hairs,

                    keep the Hun brothers, keep the black

                    guy, keep the movie shit, and keep the

                    cop at the donut shop. Lose the rest.

                    And cut the interview with the prison

                    board fellow before that. Cut it after

                    I ask, 'I take it by your answer it was

                    a whole new team.' Don't even let him

                    answer. Fuck him. Then cut to me

                    talking about the two chicken shit

                    psychiatrists and straight in Dr.

     INT. NEWS VAN - MOVING - DAY

     Through Scott's CAMERA, we're filming this in BLACK AND WHITE -

     16mm.

     NOTE: Everytime we're viewing through Scott's CAMERA, we are

     filming handheld in 16mm BLACK AND WHITE. Until otherwise

     specified, the SHOTS stay in Scott's CAMERA.

     Scott's filming the back of the newsvan. Roger's sitting in the

     back eating donuts as is Wayne. Unruly Julie's up front

     driving.

                               WAYNE

                         (with mouthful of donut)

                    How's it working, Scotty?

                               SCOTT (O.S.)

                    Perfecto!

     Roger's picking through a box of donuts. Scott PANS over to

     him, then slowly ZOOMS in on him.

                               ROGER

                    Where the fuck's the chocolate cream

                    filled? Did anyone get my chocolate

                    cream filled? If you did, it's mine.

     CU of Roger, looking into CAMERA.

                               ROGER

                    I pointed at a chocolate cream filled.

                    You saw me do it, didn't you?

     Wayne starts talking. We PAN from Roger to a CU of Wayne.

                               WAYNE

                    You were there. Did you see him put it

                    in a box?

     We PAN back to a CU of Roger.

                               ROGER

                    At the time, I was too busy explaining

                    to Scott the finer points of film.

     We ZOOM back to a WIDE SHOT.

                               SCOTT (O.S.)

                    Yeah, right. You know what he said?

                    He said, Indiana Jones And The Temple

                    Of Doom is Spielberg's best film.

     Wayne starts laughing. We hear Scott laugh too.

                               WAYNE

                         (to Roger)

                    You can't be serious?

                               ROGER

                         (preoccupied)

                    I'm as serious about that as I am about

                    going back to the donut store, and

                    dipping that stupid Mexican's head into

                    the batter for forgetting my chocolate

                    cream filled. Gimme that other box.

                               WAYNE

                    Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.

                               ROGER

                    That dumbass probably put my chocolate

                    cream filled in there by mistake.

                               WAYNE

                    Roger, no.

                               ROGER

                    What's the big deal? Take out my

                    chocolate cream filled, put one of

                    these roasted coconut---

                               WAYNE

                    Roger, do you understand what the word

                    'no' means? It's important we

                    establish a rapport. Something as

                    simple as a dozen donuts can mean the

                    world to somebody who hasn't had a

                    donut in a year.

                               ROGER

                    So you're giving a man who butchers

                    whole families, little babies included,

                    my chocolate cream filled?

     Unruly Julie HONKS the horn. Wayne gets up and looks out the

     windshield.

                               WAYNE

                    Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County

                    Jail. Julie, just park in the front.

                               ROGER

                    Wayne---

                               WAYNE

                    Roger, I'm starting to get pissed.

                    Just drop this fuckin' donut shit, and

                    gather your gear.

     The van stops. Wayne slides open the panel door, and steps out.

     EXT. LOS ANGELES COUNTY JAIL - DAY

     BACK TO: COLOR 35mm.

     Wayne hops out of the van and is approached by Superintendent

     Phil Wurlitzer who's followed by two DEPUTY SHERIFFS.

                               WAYNE

                         (aside to Scott)

                    Here's the welcome wagon.

     Wurlitzer reaches them and shakes Wayne's hand.

                               WURLITZER

                    Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer.

                    We talked on the phone. It's a

                    pleasure to meet you.

                               WAYNE

                    Same here. Let me introduce my crew.

                    Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie

                    ...this is...I'm sorry. What's

                    your title again?

                               WURLITZER

                    I'm the superintendent here at L.A.

                    County Jail. Me and my deputies are

                    who you'll be working with while you're

                    here.

                               WAYNE

                    That sounds great. Look, I don't want

                    any of this to intimidate you. This is

                    not going to be a big deal. This is

                    going to be very easy.

                         (to his crew)

                    I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You

                    guys get your equipment ready, power up

                    the van and confirm a transmission code

                    for the remote. Julie come with me.

     Julie tosses the keys to Roger and shadows Wayne as he speaks

     confidentially to Wurlitzer.

                               WAYNE

                    The main thing I need is a big room,

                    shut off from the population, so we can

                    get some privacy...with a few

                    electrical outlets.

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     Wayne and his crew have set up in the food supply room off from

     the cafeteria. Being big, roomy, and unpopulated, it's perfect

     for an interview. There's eight L.A. County DEPUTY SHERIFFS

     around the room along with Wurlitzer. Roger's setting up his

     sound equipment while Unruly Julie is checking her notebook.

     Wurlitzer and a few Deputies talk among themselves. CAMERA

     moves from person to person without cutting.

                               WURLITZER

                         (to two Deputies)

                    This is just for an interview, I was

                    on the set of 'Dukes of Hazzard' once.

                    It was a much bigger deal than this.

                    They had a crew of maybe seventy-five

                    people.

     CAMERA moves to Wayne and Scott.

                               WAYNE

                    We're gonna be talking over here. But

                    I want enough freedom so if I wanna get

                    up and move around, we can.

     Wayne grabs Scott and walks him to the left.

                               WAYNE

                    Take him and walk him over this way.

                         (pretending Scott's

                         Mickey)

                    So, Mickey, killing Mallory's parents,

                    what the hell was that all about?

                         (pauses--to Scott)

                    Then maybe take him to the window.

     He walks Scott to the window.

                               WAYNE

                         (pretending Scott's

                         Mickey)

                    So, Mickey, if you were let outta jail

                    today, what's the first thing you'd do?

                         (pause--to Scott)

                    Little shit like that. I don't wanna

                    have to feel I gotta stay in the

                    chairs. We're after a cinema verite,

                    anything can happen, truth twenty-four

                    times a second kindda feel.

     End of single SHOT.

     Wurlitzer's talking with Deputies.

                               WURLITZER

                    And when it's lunch time, they don't

                    just go to McDonalds. They got cooks

                    there servin' great food. Swedish

                    meatballs...

     Wayne walks over to Wurlitzer and Deputies.

                               WURLITZER

                    How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?

                               WAYNE

                    Everything's coming along just fine.

                    Phil, I wanted to know if I could have

                    a small word with you.

                               WURLITZER

                    By all means.

     Wayne puts his hand on Wurlitzer's shoulder. They walk around

     the room.

                               WAYNE

                    You met the kids I have working for me?

                    Great bunch, aren't they?

                               WURLITZER

                    Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.

                               WAYNE

                    Scott, genius cameraman, Roger,

                    magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I

                    could sooner do without my arm than

                    Unruly Julie.

                               WURLITZER

                    Is that her real name?

                               WAYNE

                    Just a little nickname. Yep, they're

                    my kids and they're all I need. After

                    working together these past coupla

                    years, we're like well-oiled machinery.

                    No, more like a Formula race car. No,

                    scratch that one, too. What we're

                    really like is a Swiss watch. Small,

                    intricate, compact...it shouldn't

                    work as well as it does, but it does.

                    Because of the craftsmanship, the

                    expertise, and the artist's loving

                    hand.

     Wayne gives Wurlitzer a moment to digest this.

                               WURLITZER

                    I see.

                               WAYNE

                    Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever

                    been on a set before---

                               WURLITZER

                         (proudly)

                    Ya know, I was.

                               WAYNE

                         (acting surprised)

                    Really?

                               WURLITZER

                    I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set

                    about eight years ago.

                               WAYNE

                         (still acting surprised)

                    Well...small world. Well, then, you

                    know firsthand how Hollywood does

                    things. Lights all over the place,

                    generators, a hundred and fifty crew

                    members---

                               WURLITZER

                    Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there

                    was probably ninety-five people there,

                    maybe more.

                               WAYNE

                    See what I mean? It's a funny

                    business, isn't it?

                               WURLITZER

                    It sure is.

                               WAYNE

                    They got a asshole over here.

                         (pointing to his left)

                    A asshole sitting down reading a

                    magazine over there.

                         (points to his right)

                    A asshole perched up there.

                         (points straight up)

                    Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we

                    were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang

                    stuff we'd need all those assholes,

                    too. What we're about is intimacy.

                    We're about two people having a

                    conversation. Say I was interviewing

                    you. All I want you to worry about is

                    what I ask you. I want a trust to

                    develop. If you're thinking about all

                    this...

                         (indicates the hustle and

                         bustle of a set)

                    ...you're not going to relax, a trust

                    won't develop, we'll be talking a each

                    other instead of to each other, there

                    will be no chance for intimacy.

     Wayne gives Wurlitzer a chance to take this in.

                               WAYNE

                    That's why my crew is only three...an

                    invisible three.

                         (switching gears)

                    Which brings me to what I wanted to

                    talk to you about. I have to get

                    Mickey Knox to relax...Mickey Knox to

                    share what he's never shared before...

                    Mickey Knox to open doors which 'till

                    today have been closed. Well, how can

                    we expect him to do that when we got

                    Los Angeles County Sheriffs up

                    the walls.

     Suddenly, things get short between the two men.

                               WURLITZER

                         (snorts)

                    Well, just what the hell do you expect

                    me to do?

                               WAYNE

                    Lose 'em.

                               WURLITZER

                    Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest

                    idea how dangerous Knox is?

                               WAYNE

                    Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very

                    familiar with Mickey Knox's career.

     They're out and out angry.

                               WURLITZER

                    Since he and his wife have been in

                    custody, they've killed---

                               WAYNE

                    Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure

                    I know 'em better than you do.

                               WURLITZER

                    Well, let me let you in on one more fact you

                    obviously don't know. If I were to

                    take my men away, Mickey Knox would

                    snap your neck like a twig.

                               WAYNE

                    One...I can take care of myself. I

                    grew up in a tough neighbourhood, and

                    I've handled some pretty rough

                    customers in my day. Mickey Knox

                    doesn't scare me. Two...I'm a

                    journalist, and I'm prepared to take

                    that risk. Three...it ain't gonna

                    happen. Believe me when I tell you, it

                    is in Mickey Knox's own best interest

                    to play this game according to Hoyle.

                         (pause)

                    Wait a minute. We've gotten into a

                    advisory relationship here, which is

                    not what I want.

                         (pause)

                    But seriously, Phil, look at this.

     Wayne scans the room, counting the deputy sheriffs.

                               WAYNE

                         (counting)

                    We got one...two...three...four

                    ...five...six...seven...eight.

                    I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too

                    much. Let's lose some of these guys.

                               WURLITZER

                    Wayne, if it was anybody else---

                               WAYNE

                    Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam

                    up on me with all these sheriffs all

                    over the place. They hate him. He

                    hates them. What kinda intimacy am I

                    gonna create with all this hate in the

                    air. Even you and I feel it.

                               WURLITZER

                    What are we talking about?

                               WAYNE

                    Two guys?

                               WURLITZER

                    Okay. I'll take two guys off.

                               WAYNE

                    No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two

                    guys.

                               WURLITZER

                    I can't do that. Five guys.

                               WAYNE

                    Three.

                               WURLITZER

                    I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but

                    that's it.

     INT. MICKEY'S CELL - DAY

     Mickey lays on his bed with his hands behind his head.

     CAMERA DOLLIES BACK to include the bars of Mickey's cell door in

     the F.G. as two DEPUTY SHERIFFS enter FRAME and slide it open.

     The deputies each carry shotguns and a shit load of chains and

     shackles.

                               DEPUTY #1

                    On your feet! Turn your face to the

                    wall.

     Mickey gets up.

                               MICKEY

                    Now what you're supposed to say is:

                    'Five minutes, Mr. Knox.'

     OFF SCREEN the cell door slams closed.

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. MALLORY'S CELL - DAY

     CU of Mallory asleep in her bunk. The echo of Mickey's cell

     door makes her up with a jolt.

                               SCAGNETTI (O.S.)

                    Rise and shine, Mallory!

     Mallory springs out of bed, and into a fighting stance.

     CAMERA WHIP PANS to Scagnetti, inside her cell, flanked by two

     deputies with shotguns. The deputies are BINGHAM and

     WASHINGTON.

                               SCAGNETTI

                    Beautiful day for a drive, isn't it?

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. JAIL CORRIDOR - DAY

     CU of Mallory's bare feet walking in front of Bingham and

     Washington's shiny black shoes.

     The SOUND of Mallory's bare feet slapping the concrete floor,

     along with the clip-clop-clip-clop of the deputies' shoes,

     reverberates throughout the scene.

     Mallory walks slightly ahead of the two shotgun wielding

     deputies, when Scagnetti slips in beside her. He lights up a

     cigarette with his Zippo, and talks a long drag.

                               SCAGNETTI

                    It's a long trip to Bakersfield. Long

                    and hot. Ever been to Bakersfield?

     Mallory looks straight ahead.

                               SCAGNETTI

                    See, I've been there twice. And I'm

                    not lookin' forward to goin' back. But

                    I'm in and out. You, on the other

                    hand, sweetheart, are gonna spend the

                    rest of your life there. Now that's

                    what I call cruel and inhuman

                    punishment.

     Mallory shows no emotion, just keeps on walking.

                               SCAGNETTI

                    Course you're not gonna give a shit.

                    'Cause when the good doctor's get

                    through givin' you the zap...

                         (he puts his finger next

                         to his temple, pantomimes

                         being electrocuted)

                    ...You won't know where the hell you

                    are. They'll just put you on a window

                    sill, and water you every other day.

     Mallory lets out a big yawn.

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     Wayne stands at the window speaking to Scott, Roger and Unruly

     Julie. One the other side of the room Wurlitzer and his

     entourage of deputies are yucking it up, and occasionally

     bursting into laughter.

                               WAYNE

                         (to his crew)

                    And when he gets here, its no dick'n

                    around time. Make him up, clip a mike

                    on him, then leave him alone. I don't

                    want you talking to him. I don't want

                    you getting in his face. I want you

                    hiding behind your gear. You are

                    invisible.

     CAMERA PANS to the door as two deputies lead Mickey into the

     supply room. Mickey is shackled head to toe, it's a wonder how

     he can still walk.

                               WAYNE

                         (to his crew)

                    Okay, break.

     Wayne's team disburses.

                               WURLITZER

                    Okay, boys, lets start undoing him.

     Two deputies hold shotguns to Mickey's head, while two others

     start unlocking the chains. As they do, Mickey looks at Wayne.

     Wayne approaches Mickey.

                               MICKEY

                         (to Wayne)

                    Okay now, before we get started here,

                    there's a few things we have to get

                    clear about.

                               WAYNE

                    All right, Mickey.

                               MICKEY

                    Let's discuss it when I'm unbound.

     CAMERA holds on Mickey standing still as the two deputies remove

     the chains.

     INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

     CAMERA is inside a holding cell fixed on the cell door. The

     cell door is unlocked, then opened. The two deputies bring

     Mallory inside. Scagnetti wanders in, trailing behind.

     Bingham pumps his shotgun slide and places the barrel next to

     Mallory's head. Washington unlocks the cuffs around Mallory's

     wrists.

     Mallory's silent.

     Scagnetti leans up against the wall, smoking his cigarette.

                               BINGHAM

                    Turn around and face the wall!

     Mallory does.

     Bingham and Washington move to the door.

                               SCAGNETTI

                    Wait outside for a second, fellas.

                               BINGHAM

                    We're not supposed---

                               SCAGNETTI

                    Don't worry about it.

     Bingham and Washington move outside.

     Scagnetti takes out his gun and tosses it to Washington. Before

     they can protest, Scagnetti closes the door.

     Mallory stands in the middle of the cell, motionless, her back

     to him.

     Scagnetti walks up behind her.

     Mallory doesn't move.

                               SCAGNETTI

                    Want a smoke?

     Mallory's steel eyes glare at Scagnetti.

                               SCAGNETTI

                    C'mon, I already lit one for you. I

                    know you smoke.

     Mallory doesn't respond. Scagnetti takes the cigarette from his

     mouth and puts it between Mallory's lips. Hold on C.U. of

     Mallory.

                               SCAGNETTI

                    I was reading the file on you. You

                    know what it said during your

                    trial, whenever they put you on the

                    stand, no matter what they asked, your

                    answer was always the same...'I love

                    Mickey.' It also says that when they

                    gave you a polygraph, 'I love Mickey'

                    was the only thing you said that

                    registered as the truth.

     Scagnetti appears at the side of frame next to Mallory.

                               SCAGNETTI

                    Who are you supposed to be? Squeaky

                    Fromme? Is that it? Is Mickey your

                    Charles Manson? Is Mickey Jesus? Is

                    that the attraction? Or does he just

                    got a big dick?

     Scagnetti changes to Mallory's other ear.

                               SCAGNETTI

                    That's it, isn't it? Mickey's got a

                    big donkey dick.

     Scagnetti presses closer.

                               SCAGNETTI

                    Can you remember the last time you

                    fucked? Huh? What I want you to do is

                    close your eyes and remember...

                    remember the last time ol' Mickey gave

                    you the high hard one. Are ya thinkin'

                    about it? Good. Remember it. Don't

                    ever forget it cause it ain't never

                    gonna happen again. Cause when they

                    get through with all that electroshock

                    shit they got lined up for you two,

                    Mick's dick ain't gonna be worth shit.

     Mallory spits the lit cigarette unto Scagnetti's face.

     Scagnetti spins her around and slaps her.

                               SCAGNETTI

                    Look. You're gonna sit here for a

                    couple hours while I finish up the

                    arrangements. The reason they picked

                    me to be your chaperone is they know I

                    won't hesitate to put a bullet in you.

     Scagnetti has Mallory clutched tightly by her shoulders.

                               SCAGNETTI

                    So, during our journey, if any wild

                    hairs spring up on your ass, you'd

                    better slap a muzzle on 'em! Fuck with

                    me, bitch, even a little bit, you're

                    gonna get accidentally shot!

                    Comprehende?

     Mallory looks at him for a moment, then gives his a massive HEAD

     BUTT. As we hear the CRACKING of his nose, Scagnetti lets out a

     horrible scream.

     EXT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

     Bingham and Washington fumble with the keys to open the cell

     door.

     INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

     Bingham and Washington burst through the door to find Scagnetti

     face down on the ground.

     Mallory's standing, her foot pressed against the middle of

     Scagnetti's back, pulling his arms behind him trying to break

     his back. His body is bending like a branch, and he's

     screaming.

     The two deputies proceed to BEAT the shit out of her with their

     shotguns.

     Scagnetti rolls around in the B.G., holding his bloody nose,

     screaming.

                               SCAGNETTI

                    She broke my fucking nose! That bitch

                    broke my nose!

     Washington comes over to him and helps him up.

                               SCAGNETTI

                         (blood down his face)

                    She broke my nose.

                               WASHINGTON

                    I'll fix it.

     He grabs Scagnetti's nose, then SNAPS it back into place.

     Scagnetti lets out another horrible scream, and hops up and down

     from the pain.

     When the rush of pain passes, Scagnetti brings his hands down

     from his face, looking over at Mallory.

     Bingham has Mallory in the corner of the cell with the shotgun

     barrel placed in her mouth.

     CU on Scagnetti. He's a hand grenade with the pin pulled.

                               SCAGNETTI

                    Hold her, boys.

     Scagnetti walks to the corner where Mallory is. The shotgun

     barrel's out of her mouth. Bingham and Washington stand on

     either side of her, holding her in place.

     Scagnetti grabs a can of mace from Washington's belt, and brings

     it up to Mallory's face.

     Mallory and Scagnetti trade looks.

     Scagnetti gives her an intense blast of mace right in the face,

     eyes, and all over her body.

     Mallory crumples to the floor, screaming in agony.

     TWO SHOT of Bingham and Washington looking down at Mallory on

     the ground. We can hear Scagnetti still spraying her. They

     can't look at this anymore.

     Mallory wiggles on the floor as Scagnetti continues spraying her

     all over her body.

     CU of Scagnetti's bloody face smiling. We hear the SOUND of the

     can of mace running empty. It spurts to a stop.

     Scagnetti rises up to the two deputies. He hands the empty can

     back to Washington.

                               SCAGNETTI

                    I want this filled before we leave.

     The three men walk out of the holding cell, closing and locking

     the door behind them. We can still hear Mallory's screams of

     excruciating pain.

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     Mickey's sitting in a chair eating a donut. Roger's attaching a

     microphone to his shirt. Unruly Julie's applying make-up to

     Mickey's face.

                               MICKEY

                         (to Unruly Julie)

                    How come you never talk?

                               ROGER

                    She was born without a tongue.

                               MICKEY

                         (repulsed)

                    Oh my God!

                         (to Unruly Julie)

                    Sorry.

     Unruly Julie shrugs her shoulders like 'what are you gonna do' and

     continues applying make-up.

     Wayne and Wurlitzer talk.

                               WAYNE

                    So we got a deal. Four deputies---

                               WURLITZER

                    And me.

                               WAYNE

                    Why don't we make it three deputies and

                    you?

                               WURLITZER

                    Why don't I have Mickey thrown back

                    into his cell and we can forget the

                    whole thing?

                               WAYNE

                    Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and

                    you, I can live with that. We're about

                    ready to go here, so let's get rid of

                    these other assholes.

                               WURLITZER

                    Don't call my men assholes.

                               WAYNE

                    I didn't mean they were assholes. I

                    mean if they're leaving, get 'em outta

                    here.

     Wayne leaves Wurlitzer and goes over to Scott, who's setting up

     a light stand.

                               WAYNE

                    Okay, Scotty, we're stuck with four of

                    these assholes. Now I want to create

                    the illusion that this is just Mickey

                    and I chewin' the fat all by ourselves.

                    So make sure you don't film these

                    assholes. I don't want to see 'em on

                    film ever. Oh, and 'Live at Five'

                    slated our spot as human interest which

                    means we'll go live at just after

                    five-thirty.

     Wayne exits to reveal Mickey in B.G.

     Wurlitzer's speaking with his four deputies.

                               WURLITZER

                    This asshole's tryin' to tell me what

                    I'm gonna do in my jail. Fuck him!

                    This nanderfuck doesn't know what he's

                    dealin' with here, but we do. And if

                    shit happens, he ain't gonna be

                    responsible, we are. So keep your

                    shotguns out, your fingers on the

                    triggers, and be ready to fire at a

                    moment's notice.

     BACK TO: Mickey alone in FRAME, sitting in a chair and eating a

     donut. He takes a big bite.

                               ROGER

                    Say something.

                               MICKEY

                         (mouthful of donut)

                    What?

                               ROGER

                    Anything.

     Mickey swallows the bite of donut, pauses, then recites a poem.

                               MICKEY

                         (talking in rhyme)

                    I stand amid the roar

                    Of a surf tormented shore,

                    As I hold within my hand

                    Grains of the golden sand--

                    How few! yet how they creep

                    Through my fingers to the deep,

                    While I weep--while I weep!

                    O God! can I not save

                    One from the pitiless wave?

                    Is all that we see or seem

                    But a dream within a dream?

     Mickey bites into the donut.

                               MICKEY

                         (mouthful of donut)

                    How was that?

     Roger joins him in FRAME and adjusts the mike.

                               ROGER

                    Ah...fine. Let me make an adjustment

                    here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n

                    roll. Oh...uh, the dumbass at the

                    donut place put a chocolate cream

                    filled I asked for in your box.

                               MICKEY

                    There's a chocolate cream filled in

                    there?

                               ROGER

                    Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.

                               MICKEY

                    Tough titty, it's mine now.

                               ROGER

                    Look, I'll trade you.

     Wayne enters frame.

                               WAYNE

                    Roger, enough with the fucking donuts!

                    What did I tell you. Stop bothering

                    Mickey, and get behind your nagra.

                               ROGER

                         (to himself)

                    Fine. Roger, what the hell are you

                    doing? You're bothering the serial

                    killer.

     Roger exits FRAME.

     Wayne grabs a chair and sets it in front of Mickey.

                               WAYNE

                    Sorry about that.

                               MICKEY

                    Don't worry about it.

                               WAYNE

                    We're about ready to go here. Are you

                    ready?

                               MICKEY

                    Let's do it.

     Wayne smiles and exits FRAME.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)

                    Okay people! Let's start to settle

                    down here.

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     16mm - BLACK & WHITE

     SCENE is now SHOT through Scott's CAMERA which holds a ECU of

     Mickey's eye.

     CAMERA focuses then pulls out to include his whole face.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)

                    Are you comfortable?

     Mickey looks to Wayne OFF SCREEN and nods.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)

                    Roger?

                               ROGER (O.S.)

                    Rockin'!

                               WAYNE (O.S.)

                    Scotty?

                               SCOTT (O.S.)

                    Rollin'...and speed!

                               WAYNE (O.S.)

                    Slate it.

     CAMERA SLATE reading 'KNOX INTERVIEW -- ROLL #1' is thrust into

     view and clapped. The CAMERA ZOOMS out to include Wayne in the

     FRAME.

                               WAYNE

                    So, Mickey, tell us what you do for

                    fun.

                               MICKEY

                    Aside from the obvious?

     Mickey breaks out laughing.

                               WAYNE

                         (not amused)

                    Yes. Aside from the obvious.

    Mickey's laughing slowly runs its course.

                               MICKEY

                    Okay, let me see now. What do I do for

                    fun?

                         (to people O.S.)

                    Does anybody got a smoke? You guys are

                    drivin' me crazy with your cigarettes.

                         (to camera)

                    Sorry out there in TV land. I'm just

                    sittin' here lookin'' at these deputies

                    smokin' up a storm, and it's really

                    doin' it to me.

     A deputy comes into FRAME, hands Mickey a cigarette, then lights

     it. Deputy exits FRAME.

                               MICKEY

                    Much obliged. What do I do for fun?

                    Do you want to know what I do for fun

                    or what I did for fun?

                               WAYNE

                    What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun

                    for starters.

                               MICKEY

                    What I did for fun for starters.

                         (thinking)

                    Well, something I used to do...always

                    was a lot of fun...

                         (pause)

                    No, scratch that. Let me think of

                    something else. In fact, why don't we

                    come back to that question. Ask me

                    something else.

                               WAYNE

                    Do you miss Mallory?

                               MICKEY

                    Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my

                    wife. I haven't seen her in a long

                    time. What a stupid question.

                               WAYNE

                    Then was it worth it?

                               MICKEY

                    Was what worth it?

                               WAYNE

                    Was massacring all those people worth

                    being separated from your wife for the

                    rest of your life?

     Mickey takes a drag from his cigarette.

                               MICKEY

                    Do you think up these questions or the

                    girl with no tongue?

                               WAYNE

                    No, Mickey, I can't let you get away

                    with that shit. Answer the question.

                    Was it worth it? You haven't seen,

                    heard, or smelled Mallory in a year.

                    Was it worth it?

                               MICKEY

                    Was an instant of purity worth a

                    lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.

                               WAYNE

                    Excuse me, did you say an instant of

                    purity? What was the instant of

                    purity? The bodies you left behind on

                    your bloody trail?

                               MICKEY

                    That's only part of it. I mean, it's a

                    big, big, big part. But it's only the

                    chorus, it's not the whole song.

                               WAYNE

                         (passionately)

                    Please explain to me, Mickey, where's

                    the purity that you couldn't live

                    without in five year old Danny

                    Millhouse's blown off head? Where's

                    the purity in forty-eight people who

                    are no longer on this planet because

                    they met you and Mallory? What's so

                    fucking pure about that?

     CAMERA ZOOMS in on Mickey's face. Mickey looks at Wayne, takes

     a slow drag off his cigarette.

                               MICKEY

                    Where the purity comes into play---

     The image on the SCREEN starts to flutter, and then jams.

     WHITE LEADER fills the SCREEN.

                               SCOTT (V.O.)

                    Camera jam! I'm sorry Wayne. God.

                               WAYNE (V.O.)

                    Fucking dammit! Mickey hold onto that

                    thought. Reload, quick!

     INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

     We're back to COLOR 35mm.

     WHITE LEADER FADES to reveal the wall of the holding cell.

     CAMERA pans onto Mallory on the floor, splashing water on her

     face from the holding cell toilet. The pain has started to

     subside.

     All wet, she lies down on the ground and sings:

                               MALLORY

                         (singing)

                    Love is a hurtin' thang,

                    and it leaves a fiery sting.

                               SCOTT (V.O.)

                    Okay. Okay, we're up again.

                               WAYNE (V.O.)

                    Roll it. Save the slate.

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     16MM - BLACK & WHITE

     We're looking through Scott's CAMERA again on a new roll of

     film.

                               WAYNE

                    You just said an instant of purity was

                    preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't

                    understand. What's so pure about

                    forty-eight dead bodies?

                               MICKEY

                    You'll never understand. Me and you,

                    Wayne, we're not even the same species.

                    I used to be you...then I evolved.

                    From where you're standing, you're a

                    man. From where I'm standing, you're a

                    ape. I'm here...I'm right here...

                    and you...you're somewhere else, man.

                    You say why? I say why not?

                               WAYNE

                    Tell me about the purity.

                               MICKEY

                         (laughing)

                    It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and

                    a smoke only get you so far. You're

                    gonna have to do your job.

                               WAYNE

                         (laughs)

                    Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll

                    move on and come back later.

                               MICKEY

                    I'm sure we will.

                               WAYNE

                    Describe Mallory.

                               MICKEY

                    Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty,

                    she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two

                    feet, two hands, ten fingers...

                               WAYNE

                    Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You

                    know what I mean. Describe Mallory.

                         (points at his head)

                    What's up here?

                         (points at his heart)

                    What's in here?

                               MICKEY

                    That's indescribable.

                               WAYNE

                    Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do

                    you feel about the fact that you're

                    never gonna see Mallory again?

                               MICKEY

                         (smiles)

                    Says who?

                               WAYNE

                    Says the United States of America.

                               MICKEY

                         (laughs)

                    When have they ever been right?

     The crew laughs (O.S.)

                               MICKEY

                    Hey, just like Soupy Sales.

     INT. JAIL CORRIDOR - DAY

     Scagnetti walks down the hallway leading to the supply room.

     His face is a patchwork of medical tape, to set his broken nose.

     Bloody cotton protrudes from each nostril.

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     Scagnetti walks into the supply room. Mickey is explaining to

     Wayne 'Why he's killed all those people.' Scagnetti can't

     believe what he's seeing. The entire room is in rapture.

                               MICKEY

                    ...one night I was asleep, and a noise

                    wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit,

                    somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a

                    gun, so I go into the living room with

                    a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned

                    out to be nothing. God made the noise.

                    Who knows?

                               SCAGNETTI

                         (whispers)

                    How's it goin'?

                               WURLITZER

                         (whispers)

                    Shhhh! I wanna hear this.

     Wurlitzer sees Scagnetti's bandaged face.

                               WURLITZER

                    What the hell happened to you?

                               SCAGNETTI

                    You should see the other bitch. What

                    time you got?

                               WURLITZER

                    Two-thirty. Shhh...

     CAMERA leaves them and travels the room, studying the faces of

     the deputies, Unruly Julie, Roger, and Wayne as they listen to

     Mickey's story.

                               MICKEY

                    But I came to the direction I need a

                    gun. Do, the next day I started off

                    early for work, and I'm gonna stop by a

                    gun shop and pick up a little home

                    protection. I walked into the place

                    and had never seen so many guns in all

                    my life. So, I'm lookin' around, the

                    this really nice sales guy comes up to

                    me. His name was Warren. I'll never

                    forget his name. He was really nice.

                    Anyway, Warren showed me all these

                    different models of guns. Magnums,

                    automatics, pistols, Walters. And I

                    ask to see a shotgun. He brings me a

                    Mossberg pump action shotgun. As soon

                    as I held that baby in my hands, I knew

                    what I was gonna do. It felt so good.

                    It felt like it was a part of me. They

                    had a mirror in the store. I looked at

                    myself holding it, and looked so

                    fuckin' good, I immediately bought it.

                    Bought a bunch of boxes of ammo.

                    Turned my car around, drove to

                    Mallory's house, we took care of

                    Mallory's parents, packed up the car,

                    and we were off.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

     SAME SCENE: SHOT through Scott's CAMERA:

     MEDIUM CU on Mickey.

                               MICKEY

                    Everybody thought I'd gone crazy. The

                    cops, my mom, everybody. But you see,

                    they all missed the point of the story.

                    I wasn't crazy. But when I was holding

                    the shotgun, it all became clear. I

                    realized for the first time my one true

                    calling in life. I'm a natural born

                    killer.

                               WAYNE

                    Okay, let's cut it.

     BACK TO: COLOR 35mm

                               WAYNE

                         (to Scott)

                    Did ya get that?

     Unruly Julie hands Wayne a notebook. He starts flipping pages.

                               SCOTT

                    It's gonna be beautiful.

                               WAYNE

                    Super cool.

                         (to Mickey)

                    This is great stuff. How ya doin'?

                               MICKEY

                    I could go for a Coke.

                               WAYNE

                         (yelling)

                    Could I get a Coke for Mickey?

                               WURLITZER

                    I'm not running out and getting that

                    piece of shit a Coke.

                               WAYNE

                    Fine.

                         (to Unruly Julie)

                    Julie, why don't you make a food run?

                         (to the room)

                    What's around here?

                               DEPUTY SHERIFF

                    There's an In and Out Burgers about a

                    block away on Olive. It's walking

                    distance.

                               WAYNE

                    Okay, Julie, take everybody's order.

                    I'll have a double double with cheese,

                    french fries, and a large Coke.

     Unruly Julie writes down Wayne's order in her notebook, then

     goes from person to person collecting their orders.

     Scagnetti and Wurlitzer talk to each other.

                               WURLITZER

                    Are you all set?

                               SCAGNETTI

                    Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready

                    to roll.

                               WURLITZER

                    I assigned you Bingham and Washington

                    to go along.

     In B.G., Unruly Julie takes Scott's and Roger's orders.

                               SCAGNETTI

                    Yeah, we met. They're good men.

                               WURLITZER

                    They're real Goddamn good. They'll be

                    there for when ya need 'em. Where

                    are they?

                               SCAGNETTI

                    Waitin' in the lounge.

                               WURLITZER

                    How 'bout Mallory?

                               SCAGNETTI

                    Coolin' her jets in a holding cell.

     Unruly Julie walks up to the two men to take their order. In

     the B.G., we hear the wall phone BUZZ.

                               SCAGNETTI

                    Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.

                               WURLITZER

                    Me, neither. I don't eat meat.

     Unruly Julie walks away. A deputy yells for Wurlitzer.

                               DEPUTY SHERIFF

                    Capt'n!

                               WURLITZER

                    Yeah?

     The deputy holds the receiver of the wall phone in his hand.

                               DEPUTY SHERIFF

                    They need you. Emergency!

     Wurlitzer rushes to the phone, grabs the receiver.

                               WURLITZER

                         (into phone)

                    Talk to me.

                         (pause)

                    Where?

                         (pause)

                    For the love of Pete...okay...okay

                    ...okay. Mobilize the men. I'm on

                    my way.

     CAMERA PANS away from Wurlitzer to the extremely curious

     eavesdroppers.

     CAMERA glides by all of them: Scagnetti, Wayne, Scott, Roger,

     Unruly Julie, and finally ends up on Mickey.

     CAMERA holds on Mickey as he contemplates Wurlitzer's

     conversation.

     OFF SCREEN the phone receiver being SLAMMED down.

                               WURLITZER (O.S.)

                    I'll be a son of a bitch. There's a

                    riot going on in the laundry room.

                               DEPUTY SHERIFF (O.S.)

                    Is it serious?

                               WURLITZER (O.S.)

                    It sure as hell is. They got guns,

                    hostages, and explosives.

     The room reacts.

                               WURLITZER (O.S.)

                    Jack, could you stay up here for a

                    while?

                               SCAGNETTI (O.S.)

                    Yeah, sure.

                               WURLITZER (O.S.)

                    I'm taking one of these men. Yates,

                    come with me.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)

                    Could we go with you and film it?

                               WURLITZER (O.S.)

                    Stay up here and finish your interview,

                    I've got to see what the hell's going

                    on down there before I can take

                    responsibility for you to film there.

     We hear Wurlitzer and Deputy Yates walk out.

     Unruly Julie walks into FRAME next to Mickey. She has her

     notebook.

                               MICKEY

                    I'll have a four by four. That's four

                    patty burgers. Now they don't have

                    that on the menu, but if you order a

                    four by four, they'll know what you're

                    talking about. A large Coke and two

                    orders of fries.

     When she finishes writing down Mickey's order, Julie walks off

     silently.

     CAMERA follows Julie out the door and into...

     INT. JAIL CORRIDOR - DAY

     CAMERA DOLLIES with Julie as she walks down the corridor.

     As DEPUTIES with shotguns and riot gear speed down the hall, the

     CAMERA passes Julie and speeds down the corridor, following the

     DEPUTIES into BLACKNESS.

     INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

     CAMERA PANS from blackness to WIDE ANGLE of a dark jail wall

     masques with shadows of prison bars. The surreal echoing sounds

     of a riot swell until...

     A SHADOW of a PRISON GUARD stumbles into frame, followed by a

     MOB of other SHADOWS carrying NIGHTSTICKS and BARS.

     The Mob catches the Prison Guard and beat him mercilessly before

     moving on.

     CAMERA TILTS down to a CU of a thin stream of BLOOD crawling

     across the floor.

                                                    FADE TO BLACK:

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     SHOT through Scott's CAMERA:

     FOCUSING on Mickey, who's standing in a MEDIUM SHOT.

                               MICKEY

                    You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?

                               WAYNE (O.S.)

                    Sure.

                               MICKEY

                    Now, I'm no comedian, but it's pretty

                    funny. It's a Little Johnny joke. Now

                    in the joke, Little Johnny can't talk.

                    And Little Johnny's teenage sister asks

                    her mother if she can go out on a date.

     As Mickey tells this joke, he moves around the room. Scott's

     CAMERA follows.

                               MICKEY

                    The mother asks, 'Where's he taking

                    you?' The sister says, 'The drive-in

                    movie.' The mother tells her she can

                    only go if she takes Little Johnny with

                    her. She says okay. They go to the

                    drive-in, they come back. The mother

                    gets Little Johnny and says, 'Okay,

                    what happened? Where did ya go?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, draws a square in the air, and acts

     like he's driving.

                               MICKEY

                    Mother says, 'The drive-in movie. What

                    did they do?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, acts like he's kissing.

                               MICKEY

                    'They kissed. What else?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, starts squeezing imaginary breasts.

                               MICKEY

                    'He felt her up? What else?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, acts like he's undressing.

                               MICKEY

                         (dumbfounded)

                    'They took off their clothes? What

                    else?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, vigorously acts as if he's having sex.

                               MICKEY

                    'They did it? What were you doing?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, vigorously acts as if he's jacking

     off.

     Everyone in the room breaks up. Wayne, the boys, the deputies,

     even Scagnetti cracks a smile.

     As Mickey was telling the joke, he stopped in front of Deputy #4

     during the punchline.

     While everybody's laughing, Mickey SLAMS his elbow in Deputy

     #4's face. Mickey grabs hold of the shotgun, rips it from

     Deputy #4's grasp, then BASHES him in the face three times with

     the butt.

     Deputy #4 drops, ugly and unconscious.

     Scott's CAMERA goes wild.

     BACK TO: COLOR 35mm.

     The other deputies react.

     Mickey pumps the shotgun slide and shoots, hitting Deputy #5 in

     the chest, BLOWING him off his feet. He lands on his back with

     a THUD.

     Deputy #3 raises his shotgun. Mickey drops to a crouching

     position and FIRES, BLASTING Deputy #3 in the groin.

     Deputy #3 crumples into the wall, FIRING his gun -- SLOW MOTION.

     The stray bullet THUNKS Scott right in the chest, BLOWING him

     out of FRAME.

     Deputy #3 drops to the floor, FIRING his shotgun straight up --

     SLOW MOTION.

     CU of ceiling being BLASTED.

     Chunks of plaster and rock rain down on Sheriff #3.

     Scagnetti has whipped out his gun and is bringing it up to

     fire -- SLOW MOTION.

     Mickey, still crouched down, spins around toward Scagnetti --

     SLOW MOTION.

     Scagnetti has his gun aimed at Mickey.

     Squatting, Mickey has the shotgun trained on Scagnetti.

     They're positioned across from each other on opposite sides of

     the room.

     Nobody fires.

     We DOLLY past the faces of both Wayne and Roger, who are flat on

     the ground, scared to death.

     CU on Scagnetti's face.

     CU on Mickey's face.

     CU on Scagnetti's finger putting pressure on the trigger, then

     CAMERA moves up to a CU profile of his face.

     OVERHEAD SHOT of Mickey. CAMERA moves down in front of him into

     a CU on his face.

                               MICKEY

                    Looks like we got a Mexican standoff.

                               SCAGNETTI

                    Slide the shotgun over here, put your

                    hands behind your head, put your

                    forehead on the floor.

                               MICKEY

                    Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow

                    you in half and you know it.

                               SCAGNETTI

                    I've never wounded anything in my life.

                    I got you locked right between the eyes.

     Mickey rises.

                               MICKEY

                    If you don't drop that toy, I'm blowin'

                    you in half on three. So, if you got

                    me locked, take the shot. One...

     DOLLY in on Scagnetti's gun in F.G., past the gun, to his face.

                               MICKEY (O.S.)

                    Two...

     DOLLY continues closing in on Scagnetti's face.

     Wayne watches, wide eyed.

                               MICKEY

                    Three!

     MEDIUM SHOT on Scagnetti.

                               SCAGNETTI

                    Hold it! Don't shoot!

     He CLICKS the hammer back into place on his gun, then points the gun up.

                               MICKEY

                    Open the chamber. Empty the shells.

     Scagnetti does. The shells fall out.

     The shells fall on the floor at Scagnetti's feet -- SLOW MOTION.

                               MICKEY

                    Toss it.

     Scagnetti does.

                               MICKEY

                    Now put your hands behind your head.

     Scagnetti does.

     Mickey, holding the shotgun, walks up to Scagnetti. They stand,

     facing each other.

                               MICKEY

                    Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'

                               SCAGNETTI

                    What?

     Mickey CLOUTS him across the face with the shotgun. Scagnetti

     hits the ground. Blood coughs from his broken nose.

     Mickey looks at Wayne and Roger on the ground.

                               MICKEY

                    You guys stay on your bellies.

                               ROGER

                    Yes, sir.

     Mickey bends over Scagnetti and takes hold of his right hand.

                               MICKEY

                    I am the most dangerous man in the

                    world.

     Mickey SNAPS the trigger finger on Scagnetti's right hand.

     Scagnetti screams.

     Mickey's still bent over Scagnetti.

                               MICKEY

                         (points at Scagnetti)

                    You're the law.

                         (points at himself)

                    I'm the law breaker.

     Scagnetti's not going to give Mickey and more trouble.

     Mickey stands straight, looks toward Wayne and Roger.

                               MICKEY

                    Donut, get your camera. See if it's

                    broke.

                               WAYNE

                    Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.

                               MICKEY

                    Scott's dead. And unless you wanna

                    play follow the leader, shut up and do

                    as you're told.

     Roger's checking the camera. He turns on the motor. It sounds

     like a lawn mower.

                               MICKEY

                    How is it?

                               ROGER

                    Not good.

                               MICKEY

                    Do you have a back up.

                               ROGER

                    It's video.

                               MICKEY

                    Even better. Wayne call your station,

                    tell 'em we're going live a little

                    early today. Make it happen!

     INT. JAIL LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

     Wurlitzer steps into the BLACK FRAME. This SCENE becomes a

     TRAVELLING CU that never leaves Wurlitzer. Although we'll only

     see Wurlitzer, we can make out activity in the edges of the

     FRAME and we can vividly hear the SOUNDS of chaos around us.

                               WURLITZER

                    I want two men stationed in that tier,

                    and I want men with rifles all along

                    the walkway.

                               PITNEY (O.S.)

                    Capt'n!

     Wurlitzer walks over to a table and looks down.

                               PITNEY (O.S.)

                    Here's the layout of the laundry room.

                               WURLITZER

                    Where do the air ducts lead?

                               PITNEY (O.S.)

                    Here.

                               SMITHY (O.S.)

                    Problem is they'll hear somebody

                    approaching that way.

                               PITNEY (O.S.)

                    We turned off the power when they took

                    over the room.

                               WURLITZER

                    We turn it back on. The machines go

                    back on supplying us with the cover

                    noise we need. Smithy, do it.

                               SMITHY (O.S.)

                    Right away, Capt'n.

     CAMERA follows Wurlitzer as he heads another direction.

                               WURLITZER

                    Jonesy, are the sharpshooters in place?

                               JONESY (O.S.)

                    Yes.

                               WURLITZER

                    You sure?

                               JONESY (O.S.)

                    I think--

                               WURLITZER

                    Never say you think when you know, or

                    you know when you think.

     Wurlitzer snatches a walkie talkie.

                               WURLITZER

                         (into walkie talkie)

                    Bergman, you in place?

                               BERGMAN (O.S.)

                         (from walkie talkie)

                    Sure am, Capt'n. Nothin' clean yet.

                               WURLITZER

                         (into walkie talkie)

                    Pass this to your team...the second

                    they get a lock on a blue, they're to

                    take the shot. Do you understand?

                               BERGMAN (O.S.)

                         (from walkie talkie)

                    That's a big ten-four, Capt'n.

     Wurlitzer looks to his right.

                               WURLITZER

                    What do you think, Pitney? How much

                    Explosives do you think that they

                    really have in there?

                               PITNEY (O.S.)

                    It's hard to say Capt'n.

                               WURLITZER

                    Take a wild stab!

                               PITNEY (O.S.)

                    I'll say enough to destroy this wing.

                               WURLITZER

                    The entire wing?

                               PITNEY (O.S.)

                    That's my opinion.

                               WURLITZER

     Mickey enters the FRAME with shotgun in hand, pushing Wayne out.

                               MICKEY

                    Thank you, Wayne, but our little movie

                    just underwent a title change. It's

                    Ladies and gentlemen, in case you have

                    just tuned in, it appears that a

                    hostage situation involving Mickey Knox

                    is developing presently at the Los

                    Angeles County Jail. We have seen that

                    he is armed and apparently there has

                    been some loss of life. We will try to

                    re-establish contact with Wayne Gayle

     WIDE SHOT of Mickey, holding his shotgun. He walks over and

     grabs the shotgun from dead Deputy #5. Deputy #5 won't let go

     of the gun from his dead man's grip. Mickey finally yanks it

     loose. He extracts all the shells from the gun, picks them off

     the floor, and puts them in his pocket.

     Mickey picks up Scagnetti's gun, inserts the loose bullets and

     slips it into his pants.

                               MICKEY

                    Okay, Jack, this is what we're doing.

                    Stand behind me, put your back against

                    mine and extend your arms behind you.

     Scagnetti rises, insecurely. He presses his back against

     Mickey's.

                               MICKEY

                    Now if I feel your back move away from

                    mine, you're gonna be ripped apart.

                    Got it?

     Scagnetti's back to back with Mickey. His arms flank Mickey.

                               SCAGNETTI

                    Yeah.

                               MICKEY

                    Okay, Wayne, step forward.

     Wayne enters FRAME. Mickey extends the shotgun.

                               MICKEY

                    Keep comin'. Put your solar plexus

                    against the barrel.

     Wayne does.

                               MICKEY

                    Grab his arms.

     Wayne does and Mickey quickly binds their arms together with

     gaffer's tape, forming a two man ring around him.

                               MICKEY

                    Either one of you two move, it's gonna

                    Yes.

     Mickey tucks the tape roll into his shirt.

                    Wagons, hooaaa!

     The hostage train starts moving. Wayne's walking backwards with

     the shotgun barrel pressed against his midsection. Scagnetti's

     walking back to back with Mickey and his own pistol pressed to

     his neck.

     Mallory runs into Mickey's arms, passionately kissing. This

     kiss has been a year coming. Now they're doing something

     everybody told them they would never do again.

     For this moment they are the only two people on earth. We're

     CAMERA TILTS to Wurlitzer reading, then looking up.

                               WURLITZER

                    Wait a minute, Bailey. Where's the

                    list of the hostages?

                               BAILEY (O.S.)

                    I'm working on it Capt'n.

                               WURLITZER

                    Keep on it, son.

     Wurlitzer reads the list to himself as he paces.

                               WURLITZER

                         (reading the names)

                    Alvarado, Issacs, Julian, Martinez,

                    Newendyke, Olvera, Pool, Ramos,

                    Schmidt, Spivey, Walsh, Westerguard...

     Wurlitzer drops into a chair, exhausted. He rubs his face with

     his hands.

                               NAPALATONI (O.S.)

                    Capt'n.

     Wurlitzer looks up, then looks back down.

                               WURLITZER

                    What is it Napalatoni?

                               NAPALATONI (O.S.)

                    Mickey Knox is loose.

     Wurlitzer looks up.

                               WURLITZER

                    What do you mean he's loose?

                               NAPALATONI (O.S.)

                    He's armed, he's killed three deputies

                    and one of Wayne Gayle's guys. At the

                    moment, he's hold up with Mallory Knox

                    in her holding cell with Wayne Gayle,

                    another TV guy, that cop fella, and two

                    other deputies as hostages. And

                    Capt'n, they have one of them news

                    cameras goin' live to KKTV. They won't

                    stop playin' it. What do you want us

                    to do?

     Wurlitzer holds a frozen look, as if a fuse has blown and his

     mind has shut down. If he were to open his mouth now nothing

     would come out. He just sits.

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

     The hostages have been cut free from each other and sit against

     the wall. Roger cradles the Betacam in his lap, rocking slowly

     as if in a trance, while Scagnetti feebly splints his broken

     fingers with the tape that hangs from his wrists. Wayne is

     standing, alert and ready for action.

     As for the two deputies, HOSTAGE DEPUTY #1 sits in anger,

     tight-lipped and stoic. The other, DEPUTY DUNCAN HOMOLKA is

     panicked and jumpy, one may never see a more nervous man.

     Mickey and Mallory stand over them with their weapons drawn.

                               MICKEY

                    Okay, we're going out that door, and

                    we're gonna march down the hall and

                    right out of the building.

                         (to Wayne)

                    Donut said something about a news van.

                               WAYNE

                    Yeah, we have a van.

                               MICKEY

                    Where's it parked?

                               WAYNE

                    Out front.

                               MICKEY

                    Let me have the keys.

     Wayne points to Roger. Roger digs through his pocket and tosses

     the keys to Mickey.

                               WAYNE

                    Mickey, can I talk to you alone?

                               MICKEY

                    No.

                               WAYNE

                    This is crazy. You can't escape like

                    this.

                               MICKEY

                    Probably not, but we're gonna give it

                    the old college try.

                               WAYNE

                    We'll all be killed.

                               MALLORY

                    Exciting, isn't it?

     Duncan begins to cry.

                               MICKEY

                    Now, when we get out there, you do what

                    we say or it's curtains. If we say

                    move, you move. If we say left, you

                    move left. If we say right, you move

                    right. If we say mole, you dig a hole.

                    Got it?

                               MALLORY

                    Are we in a big hurry?

                               MICKEY

                    You got something you want to do?

                               MALLORY

                    Yeah.

                               MICKEY

                    By all means, knock yourself out.

                               MALLORY

                    Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut.

     Roger snaps up and hoists the camera to his shoulder.

     VIDEO FOOTAGE:

     Shot through Roger's CAMERA: IMAGE FOCUSES on Mallory as she

     points to Scagnetti sitting on the floor.

                               MALLORY

                    You! Stand up!

     Scagnetti gulps, then rises knowing that he has fucked with the

     wrong woman.

     Mallory walks up to him with pistol in hand.

                               MALLORY

                    You probably thought it was pretty

                    funny, didn't ya?

     She raises Scagnetti's pistol, aiming it at its former owner.

     Scagnetti flinches and squirms.

                               MALLORY

                    Can you remember the last time you

                    fucked with me? Close your eyes and

                    remember...Are ya thinking about it?

                    Good.

     Mallory fires three shots into Scagnetti's chest.

     Roger's CAMERA jumps, then follows the body to the floor. Roger

     HOLDS on Scagnetti slumped on the floor.

                               DUNCAN (O.S.)

                    Oh God! Oh God! Ohhhh...

                               MICKEY

                    We're sending out a hostage. Don't

                    touch him!

     OFF SCREEN the door is kicked open.

     Roger's CAMERA whips around to witness Mickey and Mallory

     jumping into the corridor, BLASTING with their guns while using

     the hostages for shields. Roger's CAMERA moves out of the cell

     and...

     INT. JAIL CORRIDOR (OUTSIDE THE HOLDING CELL) - DAY

     There are even more DEPUTY SHERIFFS in the corridor.

     CROSS FIRE whistles by as Roger dodges to catch up with the

     caravan.

     The footage is very similar to Vietnam footage. It's shaky,

     real, harsh, and it captures the pandemonium of battle.

     The soundtrack is a mixture of yelling, crying, laughing,

     and gunfire.

     HOSTAGE DEPUTY #1 is SHOT, and discarded by Mickey.

     The wild caravan runs down the hallway, FIRING behind them.

     Mickey's HIT, but keeps on running and FIRING. Mallory sees

     this and screams.

                               MALLORY

                    Mickey!

                               MICKEY

                    Don't stop!

     Roger's CAMERA runs along with them.

                               ROGER (O.S.)

                    Man, oh, man...this is better than

                    Vietnam!

     More DEPUTIES appear at the end of the hallway.

     Mickey and Mallory get back to back with each other, using

     DUNCAN as a shield in front of them and Wayne behind them.

     Mickey FIRES from the front, Mallory FIRES from the rear.

                               DUNCAN

                    Please don't kill me! Don't kill me...

     CAMERA WHIP PANS to catch a Deputy hopping around the corner.

     The SCREEN FLASHES WHITE with a BLAST.

     Roger's HIT, and the CAMERA goes haywire, reeling out of

     control, the THUNKING to the ground. Roger screams O.S.

     CAMERA lies on the floor, video still transmitting. Roger rolls

     into FRAME screaming.

                               MICKEY (O.S.)

                    Get the camera! Get the fucking

                    camera!

     BACK TO: COLOR 35mm.

     As Mickey FIRES cover for her, Mallory swipes the camera from

     Roger's side.

     The Knox's start running again, still holding Wayne and last

     hostage.

     Deputies are lying on the ground, wounded and screaming, or dead

     and silent.

                               MICKEY

                         (to Mallory)

                    This way.

     INT. STAIRWELL - DAY

     The caravan bursts into the stairwell. Mickey turns to Duncan

     the remaining hostage deputy.

                               MICKEY

                         (to Duncan)

                    Where does this lead?

     Duncan is hyper-ventilating. Mickey pushes him against to

     wall.

                               MICKEY

                    Where!?!

                               DUNCAN

                    Th-- the ground floor.

                               MALLORY

                    Is that the front door?

     Duncan nods frantically.

                               MICKEY

                    Let's go.

     Mickey grabs Duncan and the caravan starts running down the

     stairs. They go down a few flights.

     As they run down one last flight, they find Wurlitzer and a team

     of DEPUTIES waiting for them on the ground floor. The deputies

     raise their guns.

     Mallory grabs hold of Wayne, and gets behind him with one hand

     pressing the barrel of her gun against his temple and her other

     are wrapped around his neck, holding him close to her.

                               MALLORY

                    Back off or I'll blast him! Back off

                    or I'll blast him! Back off or I'll

                    blast him!

     None of the deputies lower their guns, but they appear less

     likely to start shooting.

     Wayne screams.

                               WAYNE

                    Don't shoot. I beg you, don't shoot!

                    Please, please, please...

     Wayne continues begging.

     Wurlitzer steps forward.

                               WURLITZER

                    Now Mickey, Mallory, just let me say---

                               MALLORY

                    Shut up! Don't talk, I don't wanna

                    hear it!

                               WURLITZER

                    You have to know---

                               MALLORY

                    I said shut up...

     Mallory quickly lowers her gun from Wayne's head and SHOOTS him

     in the thigh. She whips the gun back up to his head.

     Wayne's screaming in pain.

     The deputies jump back.

                               MALLORY

                    ...and I mean shut up!

     There's a bit of a silent standoff.

     Tears are streaming down Duncan's face as the caravan slowly

     retreats back up the stairs to the next flight.

     The deputies hold their present position.

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. PRISON STAIRWELL - DAY

     The caravan goes up one flight, then stops. Mickey and Mallory

     let their two hostages sit down.

     Duncan is out and out hysterical, urine stains the front of his

     uniform.

     Mickey's pacing.

                               MICKEY

                    Think...think...think...

     Mallory leans up against the wall, holding her side with her

     hand. Blood trickles out between the fingers. We see now she's

     been shot.

     Over Duncan's impassioned clamour they can hear Wurlitzer yelling

     from below.

                               WURLITZER (O.S.)

                    Give up! There's no other way out!

     Mickey sits down, utterly exhausted. Mallory sits down next to.

     him. She winces in pain. He puts his arm around her.

                               MALLORY

                    Look, lover boy, we're not getting

                    outta here. So I say the hell with

                    going back to our cells. Let's do a

                    Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

                    Run down these stairs shootin', go out

                    in a hail of bullets, but take as many

                    of those motherfuckers with us as

                    possible.

     Suddenly, Mickey's exhaustion lifts. He has a plan.

                               MICKEY

                    We'll do that when all else fails.

     Mickey stands.

                               MALLORY

                    Hasn't it?

                               MICKEY

                    We still got a few tricks up our

                    sleeves.

     Mickey confronts the two hostages. He points at Duncan.

                               MICKEY

                    You married?

                               DUNCAN

                    Oh, I don't wanna die...

                               MICKEY

                    Are you married? Do you have kids?

     Duncan nods pathetically.

                               MICKEY

                    Good. People, we're goin' all the way

                    to the front door. Now, the only way

                    we're gonna get there is if they don't

                    want to kill you two more than they

                    want to kill us.

     INSERT:

     SHOTS of deputies with guns in their hands, just itching to kill

     Mickey and Mallory. We hear Mickey's voice over this SHOT.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)

                    Right now I find that highly unlikely.

                    So, let's help 'em out, shall we?

     BACK TO PRISON STAIRWELL:

     Mickey is squatting in front of Wayne.

                               MICKEY

                    Now, say I tell those guys down there

                    if they shoot or make a move, I'm

                    killin' Wayne Gayle. And they shoot or

                    make a move anyway. Now say by some

                    freak accident, you didn't die, you

                    live though it. What would you do?

     Mickey pulls the roll of GAFFER'S TAPE from his shirt and starts

     tearing strips of tape and sticking them to the wall.

                               WAYNE

                    What would I do? Me and my network

                    would sue the entire Los Angeles County

                    Sheriffs Department for flagrantly

                    disregarding my safety. I'd go

                    straight to my buddy, the mayor, and

                    make sure everyone of those son of a

                    bitches down there ends up on the

                    unemployment line. In fact, I'd sue

                    every man down there personally. I

                    would make it my life's ambition to

                    bring the LA County Jail to its knees.

                    I would do expose after expose on the

                    brutality, and the conditions, and the

                    inhumanity that exists here.

     Mickey tosses the tape roll to Mallory and gestures to Duncan.

     Mallory winks at Mickey. Mickey smiles and begins wrapping tape

     around the barrel of his shotgun.

                               MICKEY

                    That's what I thought. You tell them

                    that. When we go down those stairs, I

                    want you to scream what you just told

                    me. 'My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the

                    star of American Maniacs watched every

                    week by'-- how many people?

                               WAYNE

                    On average forty million.

                               MICKEY

                    'Every week by forty million people. I

                    am a respected journalist.' Have you

                    won any awards?

                               WAYNE

                    Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The

                    Edward R. Murrow award...

                               MICKEY

                    'Respected journalist'-- On your

                    knees...

     Wayne kneels in front of Mickey. While Mickey speaks he props

     his shotgun under Wayne's chin and wraps the tape from the

     barrel around his neck.

                               MICKEY

                         (continues)

                    ...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the

                    Edward R. Murrow award among others.'

                    Tell 'em the name of your personal

                    lawyer, his firm, his address, and

                    phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor

                    and the unemployment lines. You

                    getting the idea?

                               WAYNE

                    Yes.

     Mickey stands with Wayne as he tapes his trigger hand to the

     stock of the shotgun.

                               MICKEY

                    Say it. Scream it. All the way out

                    the front door and into your van. And

                    if you stop screaming, I swear to God

                    I'll blow your head off.

                               WAYNE

                    Got it.

     Mickey grabs the camera, and lifts it to his shoulder before

     shouting to Duncan.

                               MICKEY

                    You! What's your name?

     Duncan can't answer, Mallory has gagged him with his tape. Mallory

     grabs Duncan by the collar and lifts him off the floor before

     reading his name badge.

                               MALLORY

                    Duncan...Homolka?

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. PRISON STAIRWELL (GROUND FLOOR) - DAY

     Wurlitzer and the deputies are deciding their next move when

     they hear:

                               MICKEY (O.S.)

                    Start.

     Wayne and Duncan come into view with the Knoxs behind them.

     The deputies quickly raise their guns, but soon realize if they

     take out either Mickey of Mallory that Wayne or Duncan would

     die.

     Mallory's right hand is taped to the trigger and stock of the

     shotgun that's wrapped firmly to Duncan's neck. The pistol in

     her left hand is trained on Wurlitzer.

     Mickey's left hand masters the shotgun leash on Wayne, while he

     monitors the Deputies with the CAMERA on his right shoulder.

     NOTE: The following scene will intercut between VIDEO FOOTAGE

     and COLOR 35mm.

     Wayne starts belting out his speech as Mickey focus the CAMERA

     on Wurlitzer. Duncan simply cries and begs for his life to be

     spared.

                               WAYNE

                         (yelling)

                    My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the star

                    of 'American Maniacs', watched by forty

                    million people every week! I am a

                    respected journalist, winners of the

                    Golden Globe, the Edward R.

                    Murrows Award among others! If anybody

                    puts me in danger, my network will sue

                    The Los Angeles County Sheriffs

                    Department. My estate will sue every

                    officer personally who fires. The

                    network's law firm is Rowlands, Davis

                    and Sinclair...

     Mickey knew what he was doing. This has an effect on the

     deputies.

                               MALLORY

                         (yelling)

                    Make a path!

     The wall of deputies starts moving backward.

     The Knoxs and their hostages start moving forward with Wayne

     yelling all the way.

     The deputies keep their guns trained on the caravan, but they

     keep giving ground, until they reach the doors of the front

     lobby and they begin to part like the Red Sea.

     Wurlitzer stands his ground.

                               WURLITZER

                    How far do you think your gonna get?

                               MICKEY

                    Right out the front door.

                               WURLITZER

                    That'll never happen.

                               MICKEY

                    It is happening.

     The caravan marches forth. Wayne and Duncan keep shouting their

     speeches. Nobody dares to move on them, but the deputies keep

     their weapons ready.

     Wayne stops his speech to take a breath.

                               MALLORY

                    Don't stop!

     Wayne starts up again.

     The deputies are completely frustrated. Mickey and Wurlitzer

     are nose to nose.

                               WURLITZER

                         (to Mickey)

                    I will personally hunt you down, blow

                    the head off your fucking-whore-wife,

                    and plant your sick ass in the ground

                    all by myself.

                               MICKEY

                         (calmly)

                    Another day perhaps, but not today.

     Mickey leaves FRAME.

                                                    CUT TO:

     EXT. COUNTY JAIL - DAY

     The doors swing wide in SLOW MOTION as the caravan of Mickey,

     Mallory, Wayne and Duncan take their first step into the open

     air.

     A crescent of deputies frame the group in the B.G. while

     Wurlitzer stands, defeated, just behind Mickey.

     FREEZE FRAME on WIDE ANGLE.

     Image DISSOLVES to BLACK & WHITE before BURNING into WHITE

     LEADER.

     EXT. WOODS - DAY

     The WHITE LEADER is disrupted by a fogged image in BLACK &

     WHITE. The image settles into a ECU of Wayne. He's being

     filmed by a 16mm CAMERA that he is presently balancing on a

     fence post.

     This entire SCENE is played out cinema verite. The SOUND is not

     in sync as Wayne steps back into a MED SHOT. He looks directly

     into the CAMERA.

                               WAYNE

                    This is Wayne Gayle. I'm wounded and

                    my crew, Roger and Scott, are dead.

                    This may be out of sync 'cause we are

                    shooting with a wild camera and a

                    standard recorder we found in the van.

                    Mickey Knox's plan worked. We walked

                    out the front door, into my news van

                    and made our getaway. When we were

                    followed by patrol cars, Mallory Knox

                    killed Deputy Sheriff Duncan Homolka

                    and tossed his body out of the back.

                    Mickey told authorities over my police

                    band that I would surely be next if

                    they didn't give up the pursuit. They

                    took Mickey at his word and called off

                    the pursuit. Why helicopters weren't

                    employed, I don't know. My only

                    thought is it all happened too fast for

                    arrangements to be made. We've just

                    pulled off to the side of the road to

                    do this interview. Tensions run high--

     Mickey screams O.S.

                               MICKEY (O.S.)

                    We ain't got all fuckin' day!

                               WAYNE

                    Without any further ado, Mickey and

                    Mallory...

     Wayne steps forward and picks up the CAMERA and while conducting

     his interview, the CAMERA remains hand held.

     CAMERA focuses on Mallory sitting on a stump, while Mickey paces

     in and out of FRAME in the B.G.

                               WAYNE

                    Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's

                    plan? Did you think it would work?

                               MALLORY

                    It wasn't 'till we got on the ground

                    floor that I totally realized they

                    weren't gonna shoot unless we shot

                    first. When we got out of the

                    stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my

                    God. This might work.' But

                    Mickey knew it would work all along.

                    There wasn't any doubt in his mind.

                    It's not like there was and he just

                    didn't show it. He knew it would work.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)

                    What did you think then?

                               MALLORY

                    I wondered how long it would be before

                    we'd get to be alone together. And I

                    wondered if I could wait that long.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)

                    Did you have anything to do with the

                    riot in the laundry room?

                               MALLORY

                    Haven't you been listening to a fuckin'

                    word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can

                    I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?

                               WAYNE (O.S.)

                    Try to keep it to a minimum.

                               MALLORY

                    We had nothing to do with that riot.

                    That riot was just -- whatchmacallit --

     Mickey can be heard faintly in the B.G.

                              MICKEY

                    Divine intervention.

                               MALLORY

                    What he said. We didn't know jack shit

                    about and riot. It just happened. It

                    was kismet. We didn't even know those

                    people. How are we supposed to

                    organize a riot when we've been in

                    fuckin' isolation for the past year?

                    Just bleep out the fucks and jack

                    shits.

                         (laughs)

                    I mean, it's not like we care. If they

                    wanna say we masterminded the whole

                    thing, let 'em. It won't exactly keep

                    us up at night. But you said you

                    wanted the truth, and the truth is we

                    were just lucky.

     Mickey's snapping his fingers in the B.G.

                               MICKEY

                    C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)

                    So, what now?

                               MALLORY

                    Well, now me and Mickey are gonna take

                    it easy. Just enjoy each other's

                    company, stop and smell the roses,

                    notice the color purple, stuff like

                    that.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)

                    How do you intend to disappear? you're

                    probably the most famous couple in

                    America.

                               MALLORY

                    Well, back in slave times they had a

                    thing called the underground railroad.

                    And we got a whole fan club out there

                    just waiting to be conductors.

                         (to the camera)

                    So, you kids out there, keep the faith.

                    Cause Mickey and Mallory will be comin'

                    to your town real soon.

                               MICKEY

                    Okay, that's enough. End of interview.

                    We gotta move.

     Mickey approaches Wayne. CAMERA goes a little haywire as Wayne

     lowers it from his eye.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)

                    Okay, just let me swing around and film

                    myself asking the questions. And then

                    I'll do my little wrap up.

     Mickey takes the CAMERA from Wayne, and while he speaks, he

     balances it on a fence post.

                               MICKEY

                    Oh, we're gonna do a little wrap up,

                    all right. But it won't be you starin'

                    in the camera, looking dumb, and acting

                    stupid. Instead, you're gonna be

                    starin' down the barrels of our

                    shotguns and we're gonna be pullin' the

                    triggers.

     Wayne forces a chuckle. Mickey steps away from the CAMERA and into

     a THREE SHOT. The NEWS VAN is parked in the B.G.

                               WAYNE

                    That's a joke right?

     Mickey pumps the slide of his shotgun. Mallory grabs her

     shotgun from off the ground.

                               WAYNE

                    Just wait one fucking minute.

                               MICKEY

                    I said I'd give you a interview. Now

                    unless I'm mistaken, we just did a

                    interview.

                         (to Mallory)

                    We did an interview, didn't we?

                               MALLORY

                    Looked like an interview to me.

                               MICKEY

                    I said we'd give you an interview. I

                    never said we wouldn't kill you.

                               WAYNE

                    Wait! I don't know, but I kinda felt

                    during this...this whole escape that

                    a kind of bond--

     Wayne is shaking.

                               WAYNE

                         (continues)

                    ...developed between the three of

                    us. We're kindda in this together,

                    don't ya think?

                               MICKEY

                    No. Not really.

                               WAYNE

                    Don't touch those triggers! Please. I

                    think I've already proven that a live

                    Wayne Gayle is much more better that a

                    dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your

                    passport out of jail, not Duncan

                    Homolka. But me! I'll be your

                    passport outta---

                               MICKEY

                    Just save your breath, Wayne. We hate

                    you. If anybody in the fuckin' world

                    deserves to die, it's you.

     Wayne is grasping for anything.

                               WAYNE

                    Wait! You can't kill me. Mickey and

                    Mallory always leave somebody alive to

                    tell the tale.

                               MICKEY

                    We are.

                         (points to camera)

                    Your camera.

     Mickey turns to Mallory.

                               MICKEY

                         (John Wayne voice)

                    Let's make a little music, Colorada.

                               WAYNE

                    NO!!!

     The two interview subjects start PUMPING rounds into Wayne,

     who's body dances like a puppet before collapsing to the ground.

     Mickey and Mallory kiss each other passionately, then climbing

     into the news van, they drive away.

     Wayne's body lay peacefully in FRAME until the CAMERA

     eventually runs out of film.
