     FADE IN:

     PERFECT SQUARE OF BLACK

     We know that we are looking at something because its

     polished surface shimmers with light.

     PULLING BACK, other squares are revealed; the black and

     white tiles of a chess board.

     The board rises and spins, slipping beneath us we find

     ourselves MOVING ACROSS the board, MOVING THROUGH a chess

     game.

     The pieces are everywhere, checking and covering other

     pieces.  It has reached that critical moment when pieces

     are traded and the board begins to clear as two strategies

     unravel towards a final outcome.

     Standing above the pieces around him, we see the black

     king.

     We MOVE CLOSER TOWARDS his face, CLOSER TO his chiseled

     ebony features, CLOSER UNTIL we are staring into his cold

     black eyes...

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. MARSH - SUNGLASSES - DUSK

     The red setting sun is reflected in the black lens.

     Two men are tromping through the calf-deep mud of an end-

     less marsh.  It is fall, the first frost not far away and

     the foliage is brown and bare.  With the red-orange ball

     of fire melting into the horizon, the two men at first

     appear as only silhouettes or shadows slogging through the

     mire.

     The man with the sunglasses walks behind the other man.

     He is very well-dressed in a dark suit.  A .22 caliber

     gun, fitted with a long silencer, dangles from his hand.

     His name is ROBERT RATH.

     The other man is WILLIE KETCHAM.  He is also wearing a

     very expensive suit though it is being destroyed by the

     brambles and mud.

     As he lifts his foot his Gucci shoe is sucked off by the

     mud.

                             KETCHAM

               Aw-shit!

     He balances on one leg, holding his silk-socked foot in

     the air.  He looks at the shoe, already filling with mud.

     He looks at Rath.

                             KETCHAM

               How much farther?

                             RATH

               Just a little ways.  Up to those

               trees.

     About a half mile further into the thickening marsh there

     is a small cluster of trees.

                             KETCHAM

               Oh, fuck it.

     He pulls his sock off and plunges his foot into the mud.

     He smiles.  It feels good.  He hurls the sock.  Lifting

     his other foot he pulls his shoe off and hurls that.  He

     grabs for the other sock, struggling to get it off,

     laughing at himself as he slips and falls into the mud.

     Rath waits, a faint smile.

     He manages to get the sock off and then stands digging

     both feet into the dark, wet earth.

                             KETCHAM

               Hey, this feels kinda good.

     They move on, Ketcham almost playing, sinking his feet

     deep pulling them out to make a SPLURCHING, SUCKING NOISE.

                             KETCHAM

               Hey, do you mind if I talk a

               little?  I feel like, I don't

               know, talking I guess.

                             RATH

               Sure.

                             KETCHAM

               Funny, I've never been a talker.

               My wife was always getting on me

               about that.  'Say what you feel,

               tell me what's bothering you,

               you ve got to talk to me.'  I

               never would though.  Not really.

                               RATH

               Why not?

                               KETCHAM

               I don't know.  Part of me wanted

               to but part of me always said,

               'What's she going to be able to

               do?'  I don't know.  Maybe I

               didn't trust her.

     He picks up a handful of mud and begins shaping it like a

     snowball.

                             KETCHAM

               My Margaret... I loved her but you

               know what?  I cheated on her.  All

               the time.  I don't even know why.

               It wasn't the sex, Margaret was

               great in bed.  I think if I wasn't

               married I wouldn't have even looked

               at some of those women.  I knew she

               couldn't trust me, so how could I

               trust her?  If she was here right

               now I'd think that I would tell her

               that I was sorry... 'course, if she

               were here right now, maybe I

               wouldn't feel like talking.

     He throws the mud ball at the grove of trees but they are

     too far.

                             KETCHAM

               I think I've heard of you.

                             RATH

               It's possible.

                             KETCHAM

               You're pretty famous aren't you?

                             RATH

               I hope not.

                             KETCHAM

               I know this may seem like a strange

               question, but can I ask you how

               much the contract was for -- not

               to insult you or anything, I know

               you're a professional, but just

               for me, I was just wondering.

                             RATH

               It's a common question.

                             KETCHAM

               Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to

               see that price tag.  Like art,

               right?  You hang some painting

               that looks like baby-puke in your

               living room only if it costs a

               bundle.

                             RATH

               A dime.

                             KETCHAM

               One hundred thousand?  That's it?

               Jesus... Is that a lot?

                             RATH

               Average.

                             KETCHAM

               Shit... oh well.

     Ketcham laughs.

                             KETCHAM

               I have been thinking about this

               for a long while.  I knew this day

               was coming.  I knew someday

               someone would make the call on me.

               I never thought about anyone that

               I had whacked.  What do you call

               it anyway?

                             RATH

               Taken.

                             KETCHAM

               'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had

               someone taken I would call our

               General Contractor, transfer the

               money and as soon as I hung up the

               phone I forgot about them.

                             RATH

               Everyone who plays the game knows

               the rules.

                             KETCHAM

               That's exactly what I told myself.

     Ketcham laughs again.  He is getting kind of giggly, like

     he's high.

                             KETCHAM

               I always wondered what I'd be

               thinking at this exact moment.  I

               imagined that I would be thinking

               about the fucker who contracted

               this, trying to figure out who

               it was...

     Something occurs to him and he looks back at Rath.

                             RATH

               Don't know.  That's how it works.

                             KETCHAM

               That's what our General Contractor

               told us but how can you trust

               someone like that?

                             RATH

               Right.

                             KETCHAM

               I thought that I would be thinking

               about Margaret, or work, or that

               I'd be having these deep, profound

               and depressing thoughts but I'm

               not.  I'm trying to think really

               profound thoughts, but I can't.

               It seems very funny to me.

                             RATH

               What are you thinking about?

                             KETCHAM

               I'm thinking about Moonpies.  Ain't

               that funny?  I haven't had a

               Moonpie since I was ten years old.

               Right now, I'm thinking how much

               I'd love one.

                             RATH

               And an R.C.

     He's 'laughing' and Rath laughs with him.  Ketcham suddenly

     stops laughing.  They are nearly to the cluster of trees.

                             KETCHAM

               Can I ask you something?

                             RATH

               Go ahead.

                             KETCHAM

               What do other guys do?

     He looks at the trees, his voice dying in the WIND.

                             RATH

               Everyone handles it differently.

               Some are ready, some are not.

                             KETCHAM

               Do they get down on their knees,

               begging and crying?

                             RATH

               Some.

                             KETCHAM

               When I thought about this, that

               was always there, in the back of

               my head, that image of me on my

               knees, crying.  It wouldn't go

               away and it would really upset me.

               It was something that I could never

               get away from... but now, I feel

               it's okay.  I feel good.

                             RATH

               Can I ask you a question?

                             KETCHAM

               Anything.

                             RATH

               Why didn't you fade?

                              KETCHAM

               You mean quit?

                              RATH

               Yeah.

                              KETCHAM

               I used to think about it.  I had

               Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I

               thought about moving somewhere

               far away like, Europe.  I could

               see all of that, the first part,

               the getting away but I couldn't

               see that next part.  'Then what?'

               So I'd stop thinking about it and

               go back to work.  You understand?

                             RATH

               Yeah.

     Ketcham smiles and looks around at the grove of birch

     trees.

                             KETCHAM

               I always pictured that I would end

               in some land fill, under

               someone else's garbage.  I kept

               picturing those plastic diapers

               filled with some baby's green shit,

               covering me.  But this is nice...

     He looks at the sun, bloody red seeping into the black

     horizon.

                               KETCHAM

               Look at that.  I haven't watched

               the sun set in a million years.

               Do you mind?

                             RATH

               No.

     Ketcham stares at the last of the light.

                             KETCHAM

               Nice... real nice.

     With his face hidden from Rath he begins to cry.

     Rath watches Ketcham staring at the setting sun.  Rath

     looks down at the gun limply held in his hand.

     When the sun is gone, a red glow at the bottom of a dark-

     ening sky, we hear the GUN, SILENCED, ONCE, then the BODY

     FALLING INTO THE MUD.  After a beat we hear TWO MORE

     SHOTS.

     Ketcham is lying face down, already sinking into the mud,

     a red cloud mushrooming around his head like the red haze

     left by the dying sun.

     Rath breathes in deep and lets the air out slowly, stand-

     ing alone in the middle of nowhere.

     INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

     The room is dark and still.

     A man is standing at a wall of windows that glow from the

     amber wash of urban light.

     Snow is falling, heavy white flakes glittering in the

     city's electric night.

     The man finishes his bourbon, ICE CLINKING in the empty

     glass.  He is slightly drunk and he sways forward until

     his forehead rests against the window.

     In the dim light, we recognize the man as Rath.

     Outside there is a beautiful stone church decorated for

     Christmas.  He watches the snowflakes drift to the

     distant street below.

     He is wondering what it would feel like to let himself

     fall, when there is a KNOCK at the door.

     Crossing the room, he opens the door.  Backlit by the

     bright hallway light is a WOMAN.  She has already removed

     her coat and though she is only a silhouette we can see

     that her dress is very short and very tight.

                             ESCORT (WOMAN)

               Hi.  Did you call --

                             RATH

               Yes.  Please come in.

     Her HIGH HEELS TAP against the tile foyer as she enters

     and he takes her coat.

                             ESCORT

               Goodness, it's so dark...

     She reaches for the wall switch but he stops her.

                             RATH

               I prefer it like this.

                             ESCORT

               How can a beautiful man like you

               be shy?

     He smiles.

                             RATH

               I prefer it, that's all.

     She moves closer to him, the sexual confidence of her

     body radiating like heat.

                             ESCORT

               It's okay, honey.  We can do it

               anyway you want.

     Rath is obviously uncomfortable.

                             RATH

               Would you like a drink?

                             ESCORT

               I'd love one.  Whatever you're

               having.

     They move into the room, from a distance, as featureless

     as two shadows.

     She stands at the windows watching the snow-bubble of a

     city night.

                             ESCORT

               Beautiful.

     He hands her the drink.  Her smile is bright and perfect.

                             ESCORT

               Good will towards men.

     Their glasses clink as he drains half his drink.  If she

     drinks at all, we can not tell.

                             RATH

               Why are you working today?

                             ESCORT

               Holidays are our busiest days.  No

               one likes to be alone on holidays.

               I know I don't.

     She touches his face, the caress and her expression of

     tenderness seemingly genuine.

                             RATH

               You're very good at this aren't

               you?

                             ESCORT

               I think you're supposed to answer

               that question.

     Her hand slides down his chest, but before it goes any

     farther Rath turns away, returning to the bar.

                             RATH

               I know what you expect, but I

               don't want...

     He pours himself another drink.

                             ESCORT

               That's okay, hon, I always expect

               the unexpected.

                             RATH

               I called because I just want... I

               need to talk.

     She sits on the couch, her body language changing, as she

     becomes a listener.

                             RATH

               I've been thinking about my life,

               about things I have done... What I

               do for a living is in some ways

               similiar to what you do.

     He sits on the other end of the couch, his words thickened

     by the alcohol.

                             RATH

               I know that everything has a

               price.  I want you to understand

               that I'm willing to pay.

     He takes out an envelope and puts it between them.  She

     picks it up, glancing inside at a stack of hundred

     dollar bills.

                             ESCORT

               For what?

                             RATH

               Honesty.

     She puts the envelope down.

                             RATH

               I just want to ask you some

               questions.

     Uncomfortable, she waits as he searches his drink for

     the right words.

                             RATH

               Do you ever regret things you've

               done?

                             ESCORT

               Everyone regrets something.

                             RATH

               But when you finLsh a job,

               afterwards do you think about

               them?

                             ESCORT

               Sometimes.

                             RATH

               Do you think about their wives or

               their families?

                             ESCORT

               No.  They call me, I don't call

               them.  If they didn't call I

               wouldn't exist.

     Rath nods.  His next question is barely audible.

                             RATH

               Do you ever think about starting

               over?

                             ESCORT

               All the time.

                             RATH

               Can you tell me about it?

     For the first time we really see her take a drink.  She

     closes her eyes.

                             ESCORT

               Sometimes I dream that I meet a

               man, this good, honest man and we

               fall in love.  I imagine us living

               on a boat, reading books, sailing

               to places where no one knows who

               we were or cares what we did.

     She opens her eyes and looks at him.

                             RATH

               And what if you never meet that

               man?

     She smiles.

                             ESCORT

               Then, I'll sail alone.

                             RATH

               Do you believe that?

                             ESCORT

               Are you asking me if I believe in

               another life?

     Rath nods.

                             ESCORT

               I have to.

     She finishes her drink.

                             ESCORT

               Is that all you want?

                             RATH

               Yes.

     She picks up the money and stands.

                             RATH

               Thank you.

                             ESCORT

               Anytime.

     INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

     It is the same room but now it is very cluttered, room

     service trays and empty liquor bottles tossed about.

     He has been here for a while.

     He is sitting at the table, staring intensely at a chess

     game; we see the board and all of the pieces set in the

     same positions as in the opening sequence.

     He rubs at the whiskers that have darkened his face and

     then finishes off another bottle of bourbon.

     He flings the empty bottle across the room as he reaches

     over the board and moves one of white knights, taking a

     black rook.

     A sequence begins, obvious, and he works through it moving

     both the black and white pieces.  Suddenly he stops.  He

     gets up and shifts to the other side of the board,

     studying the game from white's perspective.

     Another sequence emerges and he trades the pieces through

     it as he moves around the table, returning to his place

     behind the black king.

     The games reaches its end as black is check-mated.

     He slumps down onto the table and looks across at the

     white king.

                             RATH

               Fuck you, Nick.

     INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAWN

     Rath is at a desk where he has set up his computer

     office; a cellular phone is plugged into a modem with

     cables winding through a scrambler and then into a fax

     machine and the latest high-powered lap-top computer.

     On the table near the desk, we see the .22, dismantled

     and cleaned, spread out on a white towel.

     He types in a complicated access code sequence, then

     waits, staring at the blank screen.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

               Where have you been, Robert?

                             RATH/SCREEN

               Sick.  The flu.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

               I don't believe you.

                             RATH

               I don't give a fuck --

                             RATH/SCREEN

               It's true.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

               I have been sitting on a contract

               from Cleveland for six days

               because of you.

                             RATH

               Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck

               your contracts --

                             RATH/SCREEN

               I need a rest.

                             CONTRACTOR/ SCREEN

               That's impossible, Robert.  You're

               at the top of your field.  These

               are the best contracts.  To stop

               now would be self-destructive.

     He looks away from the screen and sees the chess game on

     the table.

                             RATH/SCREEN

               Send the file.  I'll have the

               estimate tonight.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

               I'm worried about you, Robert.

                             RATH

               You fucking should be --

                             RATH/SCREEN

               Don't be.

     On the screen the word "Transmitting" appears.  Rath

     slowly gets out of his chair.

     The FAX MACHINE CLICKS and HUXS to life as a photograph

     of a smiling, old Italian man curls onto the desk.

     Rath begins destroying the hotel room, smashing anything

     he can get his hands on.

     INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY

     Rath is in the middle of the room which he has

     demolished.  Having showered and shaved, he is now

     standing naked, in the midst of the rubble, practicing

     the slow and graceful art of Tai Chi.

     INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

     Rath is working at the desk.  He is tallying numbers,

     materials, totaling his estimate.

     Spread out over the table are several faxed photos of

     the old Italian, Leevio Valli, usually surrounded by

     bodyguards.

     The file details Valli's life and his daily routine.  It

     includes:  phone bills, credit card and bank account

     statements, driver license and vehicle registration, the

     real estate listing of his house and even a copy of his

     income tax return.

     Satisfied with his figures, Rath plugs the phone into the

     modem and makes a call.

     The network comes on-line as the General Contractor

     types:

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

               You're too late, Robert.

     Rath types.

                             RATH/SCREEN

               What?

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

               The contract was stolen.

     Rath stares at the screen.

                             RATH/SCREEN

               Who?

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

               A new player.  He's using the name

               Nicholai.

     The name hits Rath and he sits, unable to breathe.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

               You know what must be done.

     The screen goes black as the network shuts down.

     Rath looks down at the pile of assembled facts.  He lifts

     a credit card bill on which the name of a restaurant

     appears every Friday.  The name of the restaurant has been

     circled in red pen by Rath:  "Trattoria Roma."

     EXT. TRATTORIA ROMA - NIGHT

     A red awning spans the entrance of a popular Italian

     restaurant.

     INT. TRATTORIA ROMA

     It is a large establishment with many tables and booths.

     The dinner crowd is a mix of yuppies and older Italian

     families who have been eating here for years.

     Rath is sitting alone at a booth.  With very subtle

     changes to his appearance, he looks like an older Italian.

     In front of him is a glass and a carafe of dark red wine.

     He touches neither of them.  His eyes shift as he studies

     the room.

     LEEVIO VALLI pushes into the restaurant surrounded by five

     gorillas in Italian suits.  The owner hurries to greet

     them, hugging, kissing, speaking only Italian.

     The entourage moves through the restaurant to the over-

     sized booth in the back.

     Rath does not look twice at them.  Immediately he is

     watching everyone else, looking for the other assassin.

     Leevio slides into the booth as his goons stand and sit

     around the table, obscuring him from all parts of the

     room.

     A wine steward immediately brings a bottle of red wine and

     fills their glasses.  A pretty waitress sets a steaming

     loaf of garlic bread out and a giant bowl of minestrone in

     front of Leevio.  He tells her something and she giggles.

     They joke in Italian, watching her ass as she wiggles back

     to the kitchen.

     At Leevio's table the wine steward returns to fill their

     glasses.

     It is the goon standing against the wall that is the first

     to realize that it is not the same wine steward.  He is

     the second assassin, much younger than Rath.  His name is

     BAIN.  He smiles.

     The goon reaches for his gun as --

     Bain SHATTERS the BOTTLE of wine into his face.  He

     screams.

     Leevio coughs a spray of minestrone, as a GUN flashes free

     from the white linen towel hung over the steward's arm.

     It happens instantly.  FOUR SHOTS and the goons are dead.

     Leevio screams.

                             LEEVIO

               Don't!

     A FIFTH, SIXTH and SEVENTH SHOT.

     Leevio's body falls forward and softly thuds on the table.

     Bain whips around drawing a small SEMI-AUTOMATIC WEAPON

     from his belt expecting an attack.

     Facing the screaming crowd, he begins to SHOOT anyone who

     moves or stands, men or women.

     There is chaos in the restaurant.  People scream, falling

     to the ground, scrambling under tables.

     Bain is sweating, his eyes shifting wildly from one end of

     the room to the other.

     The restaurant falls quiet except for several people who

     are sobbing.

     He moves through the room, watching, searching.

                             BAIN

               Don't anybody move.  You move,

               you're dead.

     He passes the table Rath was sitting at, but it is empty.

                             BAIN

               Come on, you chicken shit

               motherfucker.  I know you're here.

               Let's go.

     EXT. CONCRETE PARKING GARAGE

     Across the street from Trattoria Roma, Rath jacks together

     a German assault rifle with night scope.

     INT. TRATTORIA ROMA

     Bain looks out the window at the dark street.

     He turns and searches through the people huddled on the

     floor.  He aims his gun.

                             BAIN

               You!  Get up!

     A quivering wine steward stands.

     He points to another.

                             BAIN

               You, too!  Up!

     EXT. PARKING GARAGE

     THROUGH the NIGHT SCOPE we see the front door to the

     restaurant open and a group of wine stewards clumped

     together slowly back out.

     INT. TRATTORIA ROMA

     Bain is second from the end, both guns aimed at the

     stewards.

     One of them begins to cry.

                             BAIN

               Not yet.  Don't move or you're

               fucking dead.

     INT. PARKING GARAGE

     Rath moves the scope back and forth, unable to pick out

     the assassin.

                             RATH

               Shit.  Just do them all.  All of

               them.  Shit.

     He can't pull the trigger.

     EXT. TRATTORIA STOREFRONT

     The group moves toward the street.

                             BAIN

               Now run!

     Like dogs out of the gate, they bolt.

     INT. PARKING GARAGE

     Rath watches as they scatter, finding Bain in his scope.

     EXT. STREET

     A chunk of BRICK EXPLODES from the wall just behind Bain's

     head as he drops behind the row of parked cars along the

     curb.  He laughs.  We get the idea that Bain is enjoying

     this.

     INT. PARKING GARAGE

     Rath looks over his scope, talking to himself.  He is

     sweating.

                             RATH

               Shit.  What are you doing, old man?

               You're too fucking slow.

     He looks back into the scope and begins scanning the line

     of cars.

                              RATH

               Okay.  Which one?  Which one is

               yours?

     EXT. CITY STREET

     Bain is crawling alongside the tightly parked cars,

     staying low and out of sight.

     He works his way up to a black Mercedes that is parked

     illegally next to a fire hydrant and takes out his keys.

     He hits the remote unlocking the doors.

     INT. PARKING GARAGE

     Rath finds the fire hydrant in his scope, almost obscured

     by the parked Mercedes.

                             RATH

               Amateur.

     He takes aim.

     EXT. CITY STREET

     Just as Bain starts to open the door, the front TIRE

     EXPLODES.  Another second, the back TIRE EXPLODES.

                             BAIN

               Fuck!

     INT. PARKING GARAGE

     Rath waits, steely calm, his finger on the trigger.

                             RATH

               Your move.

     EXT. CITY STREET

     Bain hears the growing wail of POLICE SIRENS.  Thinking

     for a moment, he opens the car door and pulls a long

     handled switchblade and a roll of electrician's tape from

     the glove compartment.

     INT. PARKING GARAGE

     Rath sees the car light go on, but can't make out what

     Bain is doing.  The SIRENS are GETTING LOUDER.  There's a

     lot of them.

     EXT. CITY STREET

     Bain finishes taping the knife to his forearm and rolls

     his shirt sleeve down.  From his pocket he takes out a

     Gameboy and begins playing "Tetris."

     INT. PARKING GARAGE

     Rath watches as the police cars come racing down the

     street.

     EXT. CITY STREET

     The CARS SCREECH to a halt in front of the restaurant.

     The COPS jump out, drawing their weapons.

     Bain throws his guns down, raising his hands in the air.

                             BAIN

               Don't shoot!  Don't shoot!  I give

               up!

     More CARS come SCREECHING up as the two officers hold

     their beads on Bain.

                             COP

               Hit the ground!  Face down!  Spread

               your legs!

     Bain follows the orders as the second cop edges up to him,

     frisking him.  In this position the Cop is unable to find

     the knife strapped to Bain's forearm, but finds the

     Gameboy.

                             BAIN

               Hey, don't touch that!

                             COP

               Shut up!

     The Cop twists Bain's arms behind his back, handcuffing

     him tightly.

     They drag him to his feet, a swarm of police and

     paramedics in the street.

     INT. PARKING GARAGE

     Rath holds them in his cross hairs as they move to the

     police car, but is unable to get a clean shot.  Bain is

     using the cops for cover, keeping his head low.

                             RATH

               Son of a bitch.

     The Cops shove Bain into the back seat.

     Rath very quickly walks to his car, tossing his gun into

     the trunk.  He gets in and STARTS the ENGINE.

     INT. PATROL CAR

     The two Officers are outside the car talking with the

     sergeant.

     Bain, laying low beneath the windows, peeks up at the

     shadowy parking garage.  He smiles.

     The two Policemen get in the car, the second picking up

     the radio.  The driver GUNS the ENGINE and the black and

     white RUMBLES down the street.

                             COP #2

               This is 181, returning with suspect

               involved in multiple shooting at

               Trattoria Roma.  Repeat, en route

               with suspect.

     He hangs up the radio and looks back at Bain through the

     metal caging.

                             COP #2

               Jesus Christ, do you know who you

               shot in there?

     Bain almost laughs.

                             COP #2

               What are you?  Some kind of a

               hitman?

     Bain looks out the window.

                             COP #2

               You know what we call guys like you?

     Bain looks at him.

                             COP #2

               Sizzle lean.  They're gonna fry your

               ass.

     He laughs at his own joke, looking at his partner, who

     chuckles.

     EXT. CITY STREET

     Rath's car races down the street trying to catch up with

     the patrol car.

     INT. PATROL CAR

     Bain stares out the window, silent.

     Behind his back, he takes hold of his left thumb with his

     right hand.

     The Cop is playing with the Gameboy.

     With a quick jerk, he yanks the thumb out of its socket.

     His expression remains perfectly blank.

     The thumb hangs unnaturally from the hand.  The skin

     stretches strangely as he pulls the metal cuff from his

     wrist.

     The Cop turns as the SWITCHBLADE CLICKS and Bain sticks

     the knife through the wire mesh, into the cop's eye.  A

     font of blood arcs onto the windshield.

     Grabbing hold of the driver's shirt collar, Bain jabs the

     blade into the back of his neck.

     The driver screams trying to pull free of Bain's grip.

     He slams on the brakes, groping for his gun and the CAR

     SKIDS out of control.

     Bain stabs the Cop again, his GUN FIRING WILDLY as --

     The patrol car starts to flip and roll.

     INT. RATH'S CAR

     Rath turns as he hears an EXPLOSION, several blocks away.

     The TIRES SQUEAL as he makes a hard right.

     EXT. STREET

     Orange flames lick up from the belly of the overturned

     patrol car.  Oil black clouds billow into the night sky.

     Rath's car cruises past.

     Rath sees the back seat window shattered, kicked out.

     Bain is gone.

                             RATH

               I'm not done yet.

     EXT. CITY STREET INTERSECTION

     A brand new cab is sitting at a red light.

     The cabby looks into the rearview mirror, as a pair of

     headlights roll up behind him.  The car gets closer, the

     lights brighter; they don't stop.

     He shrieks as the CAR SMASHES INTO HIS, TEARING OFF HIS

     BUMPER.

     The cabby jumps out, rattling off a string of obscenities.

     Rath gets out of the white car, starting to apologize, as

     the cabby moves toward him.

     When he's close enough, Rath decks him, knocking him

     unconscious.

     He picks him up and puts him in the white car.

     Rath then gets in the cab and when the light changes to

     green, he drives off.

     INT. CAB

     Rath circles the area, turning up the cab's CB.

     A couple of CALLS CRACKLE through the speaker, before he

     hears what he's waiting for; an airport fare in this area.

     At the intersection of Adams and Nine.

     He picks up the mike.

                              RATH

               This is 1242.  I got it.

     EXT. ADAMS AND NINE

     It is a deserted intersection.  The buildings are dark and

     some of the street lights are out.

     The cab sits by itself, ENGINE RUNNING, its taillights

     glowing through the exhaust.

     INT. CAB

     Rath holds his gun cocked beneath his coat.  His other

     hand grips the door handle.

     As he waits, watching the intersection, he notices the

     cabby's ID pinned to the dashboard.

     Leaving the gun in his jacket, he reaches for the ID card.

     He rips it from the dash and as he drops it under the

     seat, the door behind him opens.  Someone gets in and

     closes the door.  Rath peers into the rearview mirror.

     It is Bain.

     For the first time we realize that the front and back of

     the cab is separated by an inch of bullet proof glass.

     There is an awkward silence as Rath sits, unsure.

     Bain looks at him.

                             BAIN

               Is there a problem?

                             RATH

               No.  No problem.  The airport,

               right?

                             BAIN

               Right.

     The cab pulls out of the intersection.

     INT. CAB

     Rath studies Bain.  There is a thin line of blood down his

     temple.  Bain is oblivious to it and pulls out his

     Gameboy, resuming his game of Tetris.

                             RATH

               How'd you cut yourself?

     Their voices are distorted through the small electric

     amplifier set in the bullet proof glass near the metal

     money exchanger.

     Bain touches the blood on his forehead, looking at it a

     bit surprised.

                             BAIN

               Oh?  Working.  A little accident.

     He wipes it off as best he can.

                             RATH

               You a waiter?  You look like a

               waiter.

     Bain is uninterested.

                             BAIN

               Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a waiter.

                             RATH

               Where?

                             BAIN

               What?

                             RATH

               What restaurant?

                             BAIN

               Uh, Fontella's

                             RATH

               So you're from around here?

                             BAIN

               No.  No I'm not.

     Bain is getting agitated.

                             RATH

               Where you from?

                             BAIN

               What is this?

                             RATH

               Not too good at small talk, eh?

                             BAIN

               Look, I'm real tired and I'm not

               interested in fucking chit-chat.

                             RATH

               I know just what you mean.  I'm

               pretty beat myself.

     Silence.

                             RATH

               Since you looked like a waiter, I

               had to ask what restaurant because

               of what happened at the Trattoria

               Roma.

     Bain looks up.

                             BAIN

               Why?  What happened?

                             RATH

               Didn't you here all them sirens?

               It's been all over the radio.  Some

               guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch

               of bystanders, in the Trattoria

               Roma.

                             BAIN

               No shit.

                             RATH

               Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli,

               and I don't care what office he's

               running for, the guy's a crook.  He

               probably had it coming, but all the

               other people.  Real sad.

                             BAIN

               Yeah.

                             RATH

               But they caught the guy.  I heard it

               all.  Sounded like he just went

               berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting

               anybody.  Drugs, probably.

                             BAIN

               Probably.

                             RATH

               I'd love to sit in that jury.  Send

               that S.O.B. right to the chair.

     Bain allows himself a bemused smile.

                             BAIN

               Sizzle lean.

     The cab passes the intersection for the airport.

     Bain sits up.

                             BAIN

               What are you doing?

                             RATH

               What?

                             BAIN

               That was Peterson back there.  That

               goes to the expressway for the

               airport.

                             RATH

               You're right.  Talking too much

               again.

                             BAIN

               Yeah well, you just blew your tip,

               pal.

                             RATH

               What?  You think I'm running you up?

                             BAIN

               Just do your job.

     Rath pulls over and slaps the cab in park.

                             BAIN

               What are you doing?

                             RATH

               Get out.  You think I'm running you

               up?  Get out.

                             BAIN

               You can't --

                             RATH

               The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I

               don't like you.  So, get the hell

               out!

     Bain can't figure out what is wrong, when he sees the

     dashboard and the missing ID.

     Their eyes meet in the rearview mirror.

                             BAIN

               Holy fucking shit!

     The cab rocks as both men move.  Instantly guns fill their

     hands.  Bain ripping out a .357 lifted from one of the

     dead cops.  Rath rolls to the side whipping the gun free

     from his jacket.

     Bain throws open the door, about to run, but stops.  He

     looks at Rath.  He wants him to run.  Anyone who moves

     away from the bullet proof glass is dead.

     Both men are silent, each holding the other in their gun

     sights.

     Bain blinks, sweat forming on his lip.

                             BAIN

               I get out, you got me.

     Bain reaches over and closes the door.  He smiles knowing

     it is the right move.

                             BAIN

               Now what?

     Rath calmly uncocks his gun.

                             RATH

               We're both going to the airport.

     Bain nods.

                             RATH

               Sit back.  Put your seatbelt on.

                             BAIN

               No fucking way.

                             RATH

               Okay, don't.

     Bain thinks.

                             RATH

               If either of us fucks around, the

               other can blow the fuel line.

     He points his gun at the floor where the fuel line runs.

     Bain sits back, aiming his gun, watching Rath.

     Rath eases back into the driver's seat, also holding his

     gun on the fuel line.

     He puts the car into drive and slides back into traffic,

     turning back towards Peterson.

     They sit in silence, studying each other, when they hit

     the expressway.  Bain can't contain himself, giddy on

     adrenaline.

                             BAIN

               Jesus -- I'm being driven to the

               airport by Robert Rath.

     He laughs.

                             BAIN

               I can't believe this.  You rolled

               some cabby for the radio, then

               waited for an airport fare.

     He laughs again.

                             BAIN

               Boy, that's fucking genius.  You're

               a fucking genius.  Then you're just

               sitting there, bullshitting with me.

               Man, no way I coulda done that!

                             RATH

               What's your name?  We both know it's

               not Nicholai.

                             BAIN

               Holy shit!  Robert Rath wants to

               know my name.

     He leans back.  This is a big moment for him.

                             BAIN

               Bain.  Michael Bain.

                             RATH

               How long have you been freelance?

                             BAIN

               Two years.  Two long fucking years.

     Something occurs to him and he leans close to the window.

                             BAIN

               Hey.  What I don't get was why

               didn't you take the shot inside the

               restaurant?  I mean you had me, a

               free shot.  That's what I would have

               done.

                             RATH

               It's just a shoot-out then.  Sixty-

               forty, at best.  Not my odds.

                             BAIN

               Sounds like chickenshit --

     He laughs hard.

                             BAIN

               Listen to me calling you

               chickenshit!

     He stops laughing and looks closely at the back of Rath's

     head.

                             BAIN

               Is that a wig?  Shit, I hate wigs!

               Wigs are the worst part of this job.

               I'd rather dye my hair than wear a

               wig.

     Rath studies him.

                             RATH

               You're wearing a wig now.

     Bain chokes on his laugh.

                             BAIN

               God damn are you good.  Everyone

               says you're so fucking good.  I just

               can't believe I'm still alive.  If I

               believed in God, I'd be down on my

               knees.  Right now -- Hey, how come

               you just didn't plug us all when we

               came through the door?

     Rath does not answer.  Bain smiles.  He knows something

     about Rath now; he doesn't like killing innocent people.

                             BAIN

               Shit if I was you, back there --

     He holds his gun up to the bulletproof glass behind Rath's

     head.

                             BAIN

               Game over.

     He laughs.

                             BAIN

               Do you mind if I ask you a couple of

               business questions?  You know I was

               wondering how much you bid this job

               at?

     Rath says nothing.

                             BAIN

               You don't have to tell me that.

               It's just, I know my bid was low,

               but was it too low?  I mean, did I

               seem like an amateur, like I didn't

               know what I was doing?

                             RATH

               We both know what you were doing.

     Bain moves close to the glass again, checking out Rath's

     gun.

                             BAIN

               Smith and Wesson .22 with an eight

               inch silencer.  Classic.  When I

               first heard you used that, I

               thought, shit, that's a lady's gun.

               Now, it's all I use.  Clean, real

               clean.

     He looks at the gun, still trained at the floor.

                             BAIN

               Would you really blow us?

     Rath does not have to answer.

                             BAIN

               Oh!  I got a question.  Jesus, this

               has been driving me crazy for years

               -- shit, listen to me.  I sound like

               some fucking fanboy.  I'm sorry, but

               I just got to ask you.  Everybody

               talks about how you left the Agency

               and got into the business and then

               how you went after the Russian,

               Nicholai Talinkov --

                             RATH

               Tachlinkov.

                             BAIN

               Yeah, that's it.  And he's like a

               fucking genius.  They said he shaded

               you over and over.  And in the end,

               he aced you again.  Shaded and

               faded.  They say he's living on some

               Greek island, but I say that's

               fucking bullshit.  I say you're the

               best and that you planted his ass.

               Am I right?

     Rath says nothing.

                             BAIN

               I bet I'm right.

     The car passes under a sign indicating the ramp for the

     Cleveland airport.

                             BAIN

               Robert Bain, driving me!  Jesus

               fucking Christ!

                             RATH

               After those cops, you'll never be

               able to come back to Cleveland.

                             BAIN

               Who the fuck cares about Cleveland.

               Cleveland blows.  What kind of marks

               have they got here?  Greasy mobster,

               teamster or some hand job

               politician.  I want the money marks.

               I want the marks that you get.

     A long beat of silence.

     The CAB RUMBLES up onto the "departures" ramp which

     circles past all of the terminals.

                             BAIN

               So what happens now?

                             RATH

               We go around once.

                             BAIN

               Bullshit.

     He throws off his seatbelt.

                             BAIN

               You tell me that we're gonna go

               around once, then, while I'm

               checking out the lay of the land,

               you bail out and send me flying over

               the bridge.  Right?  Am I right?

     Rath doesn't answer, studying the terminals, noting the

     police and airport security.

     Rath studies the terrain.  Bain studies Rath.

     Soon they have passed the entire airport.  Rath nods.

     Steering the car through traffic in onto a circle

     interchange that will bring them to the beginning.

     Bain wipes the sweat from his face.

                             RATH

               Okay.

                             BAIN

               What?  What's okay?

     Rath begins to accelerate, rounding the interchange.

                             BAIN

               What are you doing?

                             RATH

               There's a sand barricade up ahead;

               I'm going to ram this cab into it.

               The cab has an airbag, odds are good

               I'll survive.  But with this steel

               casing and bullet proof glass, odds

               for you are not so good.

     Bain laughs.

                             BAIN

               Oh man, that's sweet.  That's

               fucking sweet.

     The speedometer continues to climb.

                             BAIN

               You're bluffing.

     Rath says nothing.  Ahead, at the ramp to the terminals,

     is the sand barricade.

                             BAIN

               You're fucking with me.  You want me

               to jump.  I jump, you hit the brakes

               and bang -- Game over.

     The cab is flying at its target.

                             BAIN

               No, no.  Wait.  You don't want me to

               jump.  You're going to jump.  I'm

               stuck back here until it's too late.

               Wham -- over!

                             RATH

               I know you're going to jump.

     Bain looks at him and then at the barricade.

                             RATH

               You're still young.  Young enough to

               still think you're indestructible.

               Invincible.  You believe with utter

               certainty you can bail out at the

               last second and survive.

     The barricade hurtles toward them, rising up, filling the

     windshield.

                             RATH

               If you do survive, we'll see each

               other again.

     Bain screams, throwing open the door and hurling himself

     out.

     Rath jams on the brakes, TIRES SCREAMING, steering into

     the steel side rail, banking the car into the drums of

     sand as --

     Bain hits the pavement, bouncing like a stone skipped

     across water.

     A driver hits his brakes, swerving, just missing him.

     SAND EXPLODES from the impact and the cab bounces up over

     the median into the bus-only lanes as the driver's airbag

     balloons out of the steering wheel.

     Bain rolls and rolls, finally stopping sprawled out like a

     piece of roadkill.

     The cab careens up onto a curb, slamming into a pole, the

     radiator spitting out a cloud of WHISTLING STEAM.

     Several cars lock up and collide to avoid Bain; one car

     stopping inches from him.  A woman jumps out, rushing to

     the front of the car, but Bain is gone.

     Police CARS ROAR up into the midst of the accident.  One

     of them pulling alongside the demolished cab.  The door is

     open, the airbag popped.  Rath is gone.

     EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

     A large six flat leans out from a hill in San Francisco.

     INT. ELECTRA'S APARTMENT - DAY

     The apartment is always dark; heavy drapes cover the

     windows.

     The dining and living rooms look like the control booth of

     a network television show, stacks of video monitors and

     consoles, cables, electric wiring, coils of fiber optic

     cord duct-taped to the floors, walls and ceilings.  They

     snake through holes punched in the plaster walls and hang

     everywhere like some technological jungle.

     At the center of this tangled web is ELECTRA, a beautiful

     athletic looking woman wearing only her underwear and a

     worn robe.  She is curled up in an overstuffed chair, a

     bowl of popcorn in her lap.

     On the monitors, she is watching what at first might be

     mistaken for a soap opera; a young couple are having an

     argument.

     What is strange is that the angle never changes; a fish-

     eye lens staring down into the room.

                             MAN (V.O.)

               I don't give a shit what your mother

               thinks.  I'm not sleeping with your

               mother, I'm sleeping with you.

                             WOMAN (V.O.)

               You won't be for long, with that

               attitude.

                             MAN (V.O.)

               Jesus, Jennifer, if you're so god

               damned worried about your mother's

               approval, why don't you move back

               home so she can pat you on the head

               when you do something right.

                             ELECTRA

               Jerk.

     Jennifer is too stunned to say anything.  There is a long

     pause that is not at all like television.  It seems very

     real.

     She starts to say something, but stops, trying to keep

     herself from crying.

                             MAN (V.O.)

               Oh good.  Go ahead and cry.

                             JENNIFER (WOMAN) (V.O.)

               Would you please leave?

     Electra lifts her head, smelling the air.

                             ELECTRA

               Mmm, smell that, Nikita?

     Nikita, Electra's black cat, is stretched lazily across

     the top of a chair, her tail twitching absently.  Every

     corner of the chair has been clawed open.

     Electra reaches for the control board and throws a series

     of switches.

     The monitors flicker as the image changes.  We are now

     looking down into a kitchen.  A stove is beneath us,

     almost like a cooking show, where a round woman is taking

     out a tray of chocolate chip cookies.

     Electra smells them again, smiling as she inhales.

                             ELECTRA

               I hope she saves some for us.

     There is a BANG, a DOOR SLAMMING in another apartment, and

     a MAN YELLING.

     Electra switches back to Jennifer's apartment.

     The man is still in the living room, but Jennifer is gone.

                             MAN (V.O.)

               Do you think slamming doors is going

               to help work this out?

     Electra punches a command into a keyboard.  Several of the

     screens change, showing different rooms of the same

     apartment.  Jennifer is in the bedroom, lying on the bed

     sobbing, her face buried in a pillow.

                             MAN (V.O.)

               I can slam doors too!

     We hear the front DOOR SLAM in the hall outside of

     Electra's apartment and through the monitor speakers.  His

     stomping FOOTSTEPS FADE as he storms down the hall and

     staircase out of the building.

     Electra switches all of the screens to Jennifer.

     She watches and listens to her cry alone in her bedroom.

     Electra reaches out; her fingers lightly touch the monitor

     screen.

     INT. APARTMENT HALL

     Electra's front door opens slowly.  Timidly, she steps out

     of her apartment and walks down the hall until she is

     standing in front of Jennifer's door.

     She starts to knock, but stops herself.  She isn't sure

     she should do this.

     She paces, then turns to the door.

     She knocks, so softly it's almost impossible to hear.

     She stands, trying to force herself to knock again, when

     she hears Jennifer.

                             JENNIFER (O.S.)

               Hello?  Ken, is that you?

     Electra panics.

     The door knob turns, the door opens and JENNIFER looks out

     into the hall.  It is empty.

     INT. ELECTRA'S APARTMENT

     On the monitors, Electra watches Jennifer pick up the

     phone.

                             JENNIFER (V.O.)

               Hi, Mom, it's me.  Ken and I just

               had a big fight.

     Electra's PAGER suddenly SOUNDS.  She shuts down the

     screens and pulls out the pager, checking the number.

                             ELECTRA

               Crap.

     INT. ELECTRA'S APARTMENT

     There is a system set up that is not unlike Rath's system;

     all of the same components, though the equipment is

     bigger, more powerful and less portable.

     On a table there is a bank of phones, several cellular.

     Electra is talking on one.

                             WOMAN (V.O.)

               Electra, they are not paying you to

               sit at home and watch television.

     Electra is fiddling with five plastic computer disks; each

     has a MicroCell trademark and is labeled "Back-Up."

                             ELECTRA

               I wasn't watching television.

                             WOMAN (V.O.)

               The point is, they are paying for

               information.  Real information.  Not

               tooth paste brands.  Not whether he

               wads of folds his toilet paper.  And

               no 16 hours of recorded phone sex.

               You are wasting everyone's time with

               this shit.

                             ELECTRA

               I thought it was interesting --

                             WOMAN (V.O.)

               God damnit, Electra.  This is not a

               game.  This is business.

                             ELECTRA

               Right.  In my hands I have five

               back-up disks he made of all of his

               work last night.

                             WOMAN (V.O.)

               Jesus!  Why didn't you tell me?

                             ELECTRA

               I'll make my usual arrangements and

               expect my usual bonus.

                             WOMAN (V.O.)

               Electra --

                             ELECTRA

               A pleasure doing business with you.

     She hangs up.

     INT. LOBBY

     Electra comes down the stairs.

     Outside the large glass door she sees KEN, Jennifer's

     boyfriend, leaving.

     On the lobby floor is a letter, apparently slipped under

     the door, addressed to Jennifer Morgan.

     Electra looks out the front door window, making sure that

     Ken is gone.

     She picks up the letter and stuffs it into her pocket.

     INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

     Rath is at his computer system.

     He is staring at it, like it is a living thing, a person

     that he despises, the blank screen reflecting his own

     face.  It is an effort to bring himself to touch the

     keyboard, to type in his code.

     He waits.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

               Hello, Robert.

     Rath wants to type something but hesitates.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

               I know what happened.

                             RATH

               I bet you fucking know!

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

               It cost us.

     Rath jumps out of his chair, screaming at the screen.

                             RATH

               I give a fuck?  I'm done!  I quit!

               Do you fucking hear me!  I'm fucking

               gone!

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

               He stole another contract.

     Rath turns from the monitor, pacing.  Trying to collect

     himself.

                             RATH

               I'm being set up.  Fucking set up!

     He looks at the chess board.  He hovers over it, the

     pattern completely familiar.

                             RATH

               Is this how it went, Nick?

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

               Robert?  Robert?

     Rath turns back to the screen, speaking as he types.

                             RATH/SCREEN

               How did he know?

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

               Know what?

                             RATH/SCREEN

               The fucking contract!  How in the

               fuck did he know.

     A long beat.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

               Such language in front of a lady.

     Rath still talking and typing.

                             RATH/SCREEN

               I don't know what the fuck you are.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

               I know.  It was a joke.

     Rath stands, no longer typing.

                             RATH

               A joke?  A joke?

     Rath takes out his gun and levels it at the face of the

     screen.

                             RATH

               You think this is a fucking joke?

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

               $1,000,000.

     Rath looks at the number.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

               That's the bonus on the contract.

     Rath puts the gun down.

                             RATH/SCREEN

               Deadline?

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

               Tomorrow.  The buyer is Japanese.

               His retirement a condition of the

               bonus.

     The FAX MACHINE COMES TO LIFE, printing an inky image.

                             RATH/SCREEN

               Who is the mark?

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

               Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance

               specialist.

                             RATH

               A player?

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

               We have an M.O... Her system is

               protected by her 'pussy virus.'

     Rath looks at the fax; almost entirely black except for

     the wide, slit-iris cat eyes.

     EXT. SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT - DAY

     There is a SCREECH and BLAST of ENGINES as a 747 touches

     down, heat rising off the tarmac.

     INT. SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT - DAY

     Several passengers walk through the gate into the

     terminal.

     Across from the gate, Rath sits in a grungy airport

     cafeteria, reading a folded paper.

     He is wearing an airport security uniform, a gun holstered

     to his side.

     Taped inside the newspaper is a faxed Interpol photograph

     of a Japanese man wanted for "industrial espionage."

     At the gate, five Japanese men emerge.  Leading the group

     is the man in Rath's photo.  The other four are obviously

     muscle.

     Rath watches as they walk down the crowded terminal hall.

     When they are almost out of sight, he folds his newspaper

     and begins to follow.

     His pace and manner is that of a cautious predator.  His

     focus shifts continually from face to face, expecting to

     find Bain's.

     His hand hovers near his gun.

     Ahead of him a thin young man, wearing a long blue trench

     coat, stops.  Rath cannot see his face.

     The man starts toward a drinking fountain.

     Rath catches a glimpse of his face.  It could be Bain, but

     he isn't sure.

     The young man bends over and slurps at the stream of

     water.  He rises into the barrel of Rath's .22.

     A mouthful of water coughs from his mouth.

     It is not Bain and in the next instant, the gun is gone.

                             RATH

               Sorry.  My mistake.

     Rath continues.  They young man is unable to move.

     EXT. SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT - DAY

     The five men stride through the automated terminal doors

     and towards a waiting limousine.

     Further down, Rath, now wearing a black T-shirt and jeans,

     exits and hails a cab.

     INT. CAB

                             RATH

               Hi.  Up ahead my boss is in that

               black limo.  We're not sure which

               hotel we're at, so could you just

               follow them?

                             CABBY

               Sure.

     Rath sits back studying the faces exiting the terminal as

     the cab pulls away.

     INT. LIMOUSINE

     The five men sit in silence.  Strangely, a PHONE begins to

     RING.

     The older man, whose name is AKIRA, opens his briefcase,

     removing a cellular phone.

                             AKIRA

               Hello?

     We hear Electra's voice.  She speaks in Japanese; he uses

     English.

                             ELECTRA (V.O.)

               I trust your flight was comfortable?

                             AKIRA

               Your Japanese is excellent.

                             ELECTRA (V.O.)

               Tell the driver:  the Hyatt Hotel.

     INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     Electra is pacing, talking into the cellular phone.

                             ELECTRA

               I'll call you again in twenty

               minutes.

     She punches a button and shoves the antennae down.

     The hotel room looks like her apartment.  There is a

     computer and a series of monitors stacked on top of the

     wood laminate desk.  Cables whip and wind across the

     carpeted floor to the central air duct.

     The panel has been removed and intertwined black and gray

     coaxial run up inside the duct.

     Immediately, Electra is busy finishing her preparations.

     She snaps in several power cords and the system comes on-

     line.

     On the monitor screen, we see an empty hotel room that

     looks exactly like the one she is in.

     INT. CAB

     Rath stares out the window, watching the surrounding

     traffic, the limo still in sight.

     Something occurs to him and he looks down at the folded

     newspaper where he had hid the contract file.

     He flips past several documents before finding what he's

     looking for; the cat.

     He pulls the dark fax of Nikita and stares at it.

     INT. HOTEL ROOM

     Laying on the bed, in a patch of sunlight, Nikita watches

     Electra rush about.

     Electra grabs the sheet from under the comforter and yanks

     it out.

                             ELECTRA

               Excuse me, your Highness.

     Nikita casually walks off the bed.

     Electra takes the sheet to the open duct and tears off a

     long piece of duct-tape.

     EXT. HYATT HOTEL

     The limousine pulls up in the lavish circular driveway.

     The cab pulls in behind it.

     INT. HOTEL ROOM

     Electra checks her watch and picks up the cellular phone.

     INT. HYATT LOBBY

     The Japanese men stand in a cluster looking very rigid and

     uncomfortable.

     The BRIEFCASE RINGS.

     INT. HOTEL ROOM

     Electra is pacing again.

                             ELECTRA

               Room 1414.

     INT. HYATT LOBBY

     With several other guests, the Japanese men crowd into an

     elevator.  The doors close.

     Across the lobby, Rath enters, walking past the elevators.

     INT. ELEVATOR

     As the elevator rises, we begin to hear a SOUND, a

     familiar sound.

     Cramped in the corner is Bain.  He is PLAYING "TETRIS,"

     wearing dark sunglasses and a WALKMAN PUMPING SPEED METAL

     into his ears.

     INT. HOTEL ROOM

     Electra continues to pace, checking the monitors.

     INT. ROOM SERVICE KITCHEN

     At the switchboard, a YOUNG HOTEL EMPLOYEE wearing an

     operator's headset, takes a late breakfast order, typing

     the order in the hotel computer.

                             YOUNG MAN (YOUNG HOTEL EMPLOYEE)

               Yes, sir.  That'll be up in about

               thirty minutes.  You're welcome.

     He turns around and Rath is right behind him.

     INT. ELEVATOR

     The fourteenth floor; the BELL CHIMES, the doors slide

     open and the clump of Japanese men get out.

     Just as the doors begin to close, Bain steps out.

     INT. HALL

     Bain follows them down the hall, still PLAYING the GAME.

     There is again an ominous sense of predator moving in on

     its prey.

     As Akira finds 1414 and opens the door, another door burst

     open, a large family, heading for the pool.

     The moment is gone; the Japanese men close the door and

     Bain continues down the hall again, PLAYING the GAME.

     INT. HOTEL SUITE

     When the Japanese men enter the suite, we realize that

     this is the image on Electra's monitors.  Surveillance

     camcorders and microphones are mounted in various

     locations to display every inch of the room.  The group

     hesitates for a moment, under the electronic eyes.

     The four goons have their hands in their jackets.

     A small LAPTOP COMPUTER sits on the coffee table HUMMING

     SOFTLY.  It is the only noise in the room until a speaker

     crackles.

                             ELECTRA/SPEAKER (V.O.)

               Good morning, gentlemen.  I

               apologize for the arrangement, but

               we all know those aren't business

               cards you're reaching for.  If

               anyone leaves this room, the deal's

               off.

     INT. ROOM SERVICE KITCHEN

     The operator is unconscious, slumped in the corner.

     Rath studies the hotel computer screen intently, the

     information rolling by.

     We see that it is the previous night's room service

     receipts.

                             RATH

               One vegetarian plate and a can of

               tuna fish.  Room 1014.

     INT. HOTEL ROOM

     Electra stands in front of the monitors watching the men

     as she speaks into the microphone.

                             ELECTRA

               Ten thousand dollars per disk.

               Insert the first disk now.

     On the monitor, we see Akira at the coffee table shove the

     first disk into the laptop disk drive.

     INT. HOTEL SUITE

     Akira turns from the small computer screen and nods at a

     goon, who drops a green brick of bound one hundred dollar

     bills, down the central air duct.

     The little clock on the laptop ticks away as it copies.

     INT. HYATT HALL

     Bain is sitting on a bench entrenched in a fevered game of

     "TETRIS."

     Suddenly, he stops.

                             BAIN

               Yes!

     The display of the game reads "Game Over" and

     congratulates Bain on a new high score.

     Bain stands, smiling.  He puts the game in his pocket and

     starts down the hall.

     INT. HOTEL ROOM

     Electra is crouched at the open duct, grabbing another

     stack of money, stuffing it into her bag.

     A LOUD BANG EXPLODES out of the SPEAKERS and she looks up

     at the monitor.

     INT. HOTEL SUITE

     The lock on the door has been broken and standing in the

     frame is Bain.

                             BAIN

               Surprise!

     He raises his arm, his GUN spitting SILENT BULLETS.

     INT. HOTEL ROOM

     Electra stares in horror at the monitors as Bain grabs the

     nearest bodyguard, FIRING a SHOT into his belly.

                             ELECTRA

               Oh, God.

     INT. HOTEL SUITE

     Another SHOT and the second bodyguard falls.  The other

     two draw their handguns and Bain shields himself with the

     lifeless body of his first victim.

     They FIRE at Bain but are unable to hit him.

     Bain squeezes off TWO MORE SHOTS and the two men fall

     dead.  He lets his human shield fall to the ground and

     levels his gun on the shaking Akira.

                             AKIRA

               Don't kill me.

     Bain looks at him and smiles, then FIRES.

     INT. HOTEL ROOM

     Electra leaps at the computer, ripping the cord from the

     modem.

     Bain sees the fiber optic cable and looks right into it.

                             BAIN (V.O.)

               Tricky.  Boy, you just can't trust

               anyone these days.

     He licks the lens, leaving a smear of saliva.

     She stuffs the disks into her bag.  She puts Nikita in her

     "travel kitty" and charges for the door, grabbing her

     coat.

     Flinging it over her shoulder, she does not notice the

     letter from Ken slip out of her pocket as she bolts from

     the room.

     INT. HALL

     Electra explodes through the door and suddenly freezes.

     She is staring down the barrel of Rath's .22.

                             RATH

               Don't be stupid and you will live.

     The elevator behind Rath opens and closes against a hotel

     lobby ashtray.  He waves her into the elevator with his

     gun.

                             RATH

               Hurry.

     EXT. HYATT HOTEL - DAY

     Electra's black CAR ROARS out of the garage, onto the open

     street.

     INT. HYATT HOTEL - DAY

     The door swings open.  From the hall we can hear the

     familiar BEEPING of the COMPUTER GAME.  The room, 1014, is

     the same as Electra had left it when she ran out.

     Jutting from a shadow on the floor is the corner of Ken's

     letter.

     INT. ELECTRA'S CAR

     Electra drives, obviously nervous, as Rath watches out the

     rear window.

                             RATH

               Turn here.

     No one follows.  He turns back to her.

                             RATH

               How many bodies were there?

     He checks his watch.

                             ELECTRA

               What?

                             RATH

               He has to clean up.  How many bodies

               were there?

                             ELECTRA

               Um, five.

                             RATH

               One hour per man.

     Rath sets the timer on his watch for five hours.

     INT. HYATT HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     Bain has returned to room 1414.  Wearing rubber gloves, he

     clicks open a black leather attache and pulls out a can of

     rug cleaner.

     He picks up the phone for room service.

                              BAIN

               Hi.  This is room 1414 --

     Behind him, in the bathroom mirror, we see one of the

     Japanese men hanging from the shower by his feet.  He is

     naked.

                             BAIN

               Yes, could you send up a pot of

               coffee and my friends are going to

               need some more towels.  Thanks.

     He hangs up the phone and walks over to one of the large

     blood stains on the carpet.  He points the rug cleaner at

     the stain covering it with white foam.

     INT. ELECTRA'S CAR

     Rath sees the entrance for the expressway.

                             RATH

               Get on the expressway.

                             ELECTRA

               Where are we going?

     Rath glances back.

                             RATH

               Nowhere yet.

     Electra turns onto the highway and NIKITA HOWLS from the

     "travel kitty" in the back seat.

                             ELECTRA

               Nikita, hush.

     NIKITA wants out and HOWLS again.

                             ELECTRA

               She won't stop unless you let her

               out.

     Rath reaches back and opens the box.  Nikita springs into

     the front seat onto Rath's lap.

                             RATH

               Nikita?  She helped me find you.

                             ELECTRA

               What?  How did you know I had a cat?

                             RATH

               Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I

               guessed right.

                             ELECTRA

               Who the fuck are you?  Who do you

               work for?

                             RATH

               I work for the government.

                             ELECTRA

               Yeah?

     She studies his face, his eyes.

                             ELECTRA

               Bullshit.

                             RATH

               Yeah.

                             ELECTRA

               You're one of them, aren't you?  A

               fucking pro.

                             RATH

               I'm part of the game, just like you.

     Electra pounds the steering wheel.

                             ELECTRA

               Jesus!

     He reaches into the back seat, grabbing her bag.

                             ELECTRA

               What do you think you're doing?

     Rath plucks out the bundles of money.

                             RATH

               Twenty large?  That's all?

                             ELECTRA

               What do you mean, 'that's all'?

               What in the hell do you know?

                             RATH

               The bonus on the contract for you

               was one million dollars.

     Electra seems ready to jump out of her skin.  The

     speedometer is floating around 90.

                             RATH

               Slow down.

     He pulls out the disks.

                             RATH

               I figure that means these are worth

               ten times that, maybe more.

                             ELECTRA

               Ten million --

                             RATH

               Now you understand why I'm here.

     Electra wants to scream.  The speedometer is climbing over

     100.

                             RATH

               I really think you should slow down.

     INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

     The room is immaculate; near the door, several over-sized

     suitcases line the wall.

     Bain is sitting at the desk.  His WALKMAN is on, MUSIC

     BLASTING, as he flips casually through the telephone

     directory.

     His finger eases down a column stopping at "Morgan

     Jennifer."

     There is a KNOCK at the door.

     He smiles and tears out the page.

     There is another, LOUDER KNOCK which Bain hears this time.

     He TURN OFF the WALKMAN and opens the door; a BELLBOY is

     waiting with a luggage cart.

                             BELLBOY

               Hello, sir.  Have you some luggage

               you need carried.

     Bain gives him a wink and a smile.

                             BAIN

               Indeed I do.

     INT. ELECTRA'S CAR - NIGHT

     The red "low fuel" light is on.

                             ELECTRA

               Now what?

                             RATH

               Turn off the engine.

     Electra twists the ignition and the CAR DIES.  Rath

     glances around and we see the car is parked in a gas

     station.

                             ELECTRA

               You want me to pump?

                             RATH

               No, stay in the car.  I want you to

               understand something.  If I intended

               to kill you, you would already be

               dead.

     Electra says nothing.

     He reaches over and takes the car keys.

     When he is out of the car, Electra slowly releases the

     strangle-hold she had on the steering wheel.

                             ELECTRA

               Okay, Nikita, stay calm, think,

               breathe, think...

     Electra checks the rear view mirror, listening as Rath

     pumps the gas.  Her eyes flash down to her bag.

     Outside, Rath watches Electra through the windows.  She

     appears motionless.

     The electric gas counter races like a stop watch.

     In the car, Electra eases her hand into her bag.

     The tank full, Rath re-hangs the pump.  He walks around

     the car and heads for the station.

     Electra waits until his back is turned.  She pulls her

     tool pouch from her bag, throws it open and finds her wire

     stripper.  Reaching under the dash, she yanks out a

     tangled handful of wire.

     She looks up; Rath is inside paying.

                             ELECTRA

               Come on, come on, it's a cake walk.

     Her fingers fly with surgical precision, snipping,

     stripping, twisting.

     Rath steps out of the station as her head pops up, looking

     for him.  It takes only a second for him to realize what

     she is doing.

                             RATH

               Oh shit.

     He runs at the car as she strips the last set of wires and

     strikes them; the BATTERY GRINDS.

                             ELECTRA

               Please, please.

     He is almost there when the ENGINE FIRES.  She stomps on

     the gas, ramming the shift into drive.

     TIRES SQUEALING, the car swerves forward as Rath slams

     into it.  He bounces backward, falling to the ground.

     The car fishtails away, accelerating as Rath rolls to one

     knee, his gun automatically in his hand.  He draws a bead,

     but, he does not shoot.

     With a concerted effort, he puts the gun away.

                             RATH

               Dammit.

     EXT. ELECTRA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

     Electra's car is parked out front.

     She unlocks the lobby door and drags herself inside.

     INT. ELECTRA'S APARTMENT LOBBY

     Standing at the mailboxes flipping through her mail is

     Jennifer Morgan.  What she was hoping for is not there.

     She looks up and sees Electra.

                             JENNIFER

               Excuse me --

     Electra stops.

                             JENNIFER

               You live here, don't you?

     Electra nods.

                             JENNIFER

               I'm sorry, this may sound really

               weird, but my friend told me he

               slipped a letter under the door here

               and I was wondering if you happened

               to see it?

     Electra is in a daze, her hand moving into her pocket.

                             ELECTRA

               Letter?

                             JENNIFER

               Yeah.  He said he saw a woman with

               dark hair going into the building

               when he dropped it off.

                             ELECTRA

               No.  I don't have it.

     Electra's mouth opens and she backs away.  Jennifer is

     bothered by her reaction and she doesn't push it.

                             JENNIFER

               I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to -- I'm

               sorry.

     She shrugs and unlocks the interior door, leaving Electra

     in the lobby.

     Electra watches her, as her hand moves from pocket to

     pocket.

     A worried expression tightens her face; the letter is

     gone.

     She opens the interior door, following Jennifer up the

     stairs.

     INT. STAIRCASE

     Electra climbs the stairs, her mind pouring through the

     possibilities, filled with fear.

     By the time Electra reaches the top floor, Jennifer is

     entering her apartment.

     Electra hurries past Jennifer's door to her own.

     INT. ELECTRA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Electra flies across the living room to the monitors.

     She clicks them on, putting on Jennifer's channel.

     On the screen we see Jennifer in her living room checking

     her phone messages.  One from her mother.

     Electra throws a few switches so that Jennifer's entire

     apartment is in front of her.

     On one of the monitors we see a shadow slide across the

     oak floor as something moves along the edge of the room.

     Jennifer has moved to the bathroom and is drawing a bath.

     Electra clamps her hand over her mouth when he steps out.

     Bain moves into the dining room where Jennifer had just

     been.

     Wearing rubber surgeon's gloves, he picks up the mail that

     she had dropped on the table and sorts through it.

     Bain moves about the apartment with complete indifference

     to Jennifer's presence; as if he were invisible, as though

     he knew she couldn't see him.

     He moves into a room, just as she moves out.

     Electra watches, dizzy, sick with terror, but she is

     unable to turn away.

     Bain searches through a desk drawer, while Jennifer starts

     undressing for her bath.

     He walks down the hall and stands outside of the bathroom.

     If Jennifer would turn around she would see him.

     Electra is about to run, to call out when --

     Something catches Bain's eye.

     He moves into the bedroom, and is turned so that he is

     looking straight up into the camera.

     He inches towards it, not sure what it is.  The fiber

     optic cable is hidden in the light fixture hanging over

     the bed.

     Staring at it, he is looking right at Electra.

     Bain steps up onto the bed, his face distorting as he

     moves close to the fish-eye lens.  Poking it with his

     finger, he realizes what it is.  A warped smile stretches

     across his face as he whispers --

                             BAIN (V.O.)

               Oh, you sick little bitch --

     Electra tears away from the screen, panic seizing hold of

     her.

     She rips entire drawers out of her dresser, dumping them

     into a suitcase, stuffing in anything that looks

     important.  She grabs Nikita in the "travel kitty."

     EXT. BACK PORCH

     The door opens and Electra jumps out, slamming it behind

     her as --

     Bain turns from the back stairs.

     She leaps back inside as he whips out his GUN, PUMPING TWO

     HOLES in the door.

     INT. ELECTRA'S APARTMENT

     She scrambles from the kitchen, throwing her suitcase,

     still clutching the "travel kitty," as --

     The back DOOR EXPLODES from its hinges, Bain charging,

     FIRING his GUN.

     BULLETS HISSING past her, Electra crashes through the

     front door into the hall.

     INT. HALL

     The stairs are at the far end.  She is only halfway,

     when --

     Rath rises up the stairs, his gun cocked.

     Electra drops to the floor as --

     Behind her, Bain barrels from the apartment.

     Rath FIRES.

     The wood DOOR SPLINTERS, BULLET HOLES surrounding Bain.

     Off balance, he lunges back into the apartment.

     Rath continues FIRING, grabbing hold of Electra.

     They run down the stairs.

     EXT. REAR STAIRCASE

     Bain leaps down the flights.

     EXT. ALLEY

     Bain rushes into the street, looking in every direction.

     They are gone.

                             BAIN

               Fuck me!

     EXT. LARGE CHAIN HOTEL - NIGHT

     Somewhere in the city.

     INT. HOTEL ROOM

     Electra and Rath enter the room together but they are both

     immediately alone.

     She walks across the room to a chair in the corner,

     curling into it even as Nikita jumps up and curls into her

     lap.

     He sets his briefcase on the table at the opposite end of

     the room and sits.

     They watch each other.  Silence.

     Between then is the liquor cabinet.  Rath knows a good

     idea when he sees one.

                             RATH

               Want a drink?

     Her face is as expressionless as Nikita's.

     He pours himself a very large bourbon and slugs it down.

     Takes a deep breath, then pours himself another one.

                             RATH

               Okay...

     He returns to his table with his drink.

                             RATH

               I'm not good at this sort of thing,

               but we don't have a lot of time, so

               I'll just go ahead and get started.

               First:  you.  I ask myself, 'What is

               she thinking?'

     Her body tightens, coils.

                             RATH

               Simple.  She's scared.  She's almost

               been killed twice and now she is

               alone in a room with a man that she

               believes is an... assassin.

     Another deep pull on the bourbon.

                             RATH

               Furthermore she was brought here not

               entirely on her own accord which

               only increases her fear and

               suspicion.  Thus, as long as she is

               afraid, her first, maybe her only

               thought will be escape.  Does that

               leave me any other option?

     He slugs down the rest of his drink and stands, whipping

     out his gun.

                             RATH

               No.

     Crossing the room, he turns the gun around and offers it

     to her.  She looks at it.  Back at him.

     He puts it on the bed beside her, turns his back and walks

     to the bar.

     She picks up the gun.

                             RATH

               The gun is silenced.  She could

               shoot me right now.

     She stands, Nikita jumping from her lap.

                             RATH

               She could take the car and be far

               from here before the maid comes in

               the morning, but --

     She starts squeezing OFF ROUNDS; the LAMP EXPLODES, the

     CHAIRS around him ERUPT, tufts of white stuffing leaping

     into the air.

                             ELECTRA

               Shut up!

     He freezes, bottle in one hand, glass in the other.

                             ELECTRA

               Stop trying to tell me what I'm

               thinking!

     She moves closer to him, the gun squeezed in her fist.

                             ELECTRA

               I'll tell you what you're thinking

               -- you think I'm not going to shoot

               you but right now you're not so

               sure, are you?

     A slight shake of the head, no.

                             ELECTRA

               You're thinking that maybe it was a

               mistake to give me this gun, that

               maybe I'm not going to think about

               things logically because I'm a woman

               and I'm freaked out and I'm going to

               do something impulsive and

               irrational -- right?

     She FIRES the GUN to both sides of his head.  He's

     surprised to be alive.

                             ELECTRA

               You don't know shit about me!  Now

               sit down!

     He returns to his chair and sits with the same expression

     she had worn sitting a moment ago.

     She opens the cabinet and grabs one of the sample bottles

     of liquor.  She sucks it all down and throws the bottle

     across the room.

     Grabbing another, she sits on the edge of the bed.

                             ELECTRA

               Okay.  How did you find me?

                             RATH

               You're the computer hacker, you tell

               me.

                             ELECTRA

               You didn't know anything about me.

     Nikita rubs up against her leg.

                             ELECTRA

               Nikita?

                             RATH

               Yellow Pages.  V for veterinarian.

               There aren't that many.

     She nods, slurping at her bottle.

                             ELECTRA

               You're one of them, aren't you?

                             RATH

               'Them'?

                             ELECTRA

               An assassin?

                             RATH

               Until a minute ago.

                             ELECTRA

               What does that mean?

                             RATH

               If I still was what I used to be,

               you would not be pointing that at

               me.

     Electra eyes him, considers shooting him right now.

                             ELECTRA

               Who is that other guy?

                             RATH

               Another contractor.

                             ELECTRA

               Someone hired both of you?

                             RATH

               No.  They hired Bain.  The contract

               would have been mine, but Bain took

               it from me as he took the previous

               one.

                             ELECTRA

               So this is something between you and

               him?

                             RATH

               He stole the contract knowing that

               I would come after him.

                             ELECTRA

               Why?

                             RATH

               Because he is trying to retire me.

                             ELECTRA

               He wants to kill you?

                             RATH

               Yes.

                             ELECTRA

               Why?

                             RATH

               The nature of the business.  You

               remove your competition.

                             ELECTRA

               And you want to use me to get him?

                             RATH

               Yes.

                             ELECTRA

               Forget it!

                             RATH

               We don't have a choice.

     She FIRES the GUN, pocking the wall behind him.

                             ELECTRA

               Don't tell me I don't have a choice!

                             RATH

               Right.

                             ELECTRA

               I'm two seconds away from making my

               choice which means you've got two

               seconds to tell me why I shouldn't

               shoot you.

                             RATH

               It's simple.  You need me.  I need

               you.  And we will both need money.

                             ELECTRA

               I don't need you to get the money --

               my money!

                             RATH

               If it hadn't been for me, you would

               be dead.

     She's up pacing, knowing there is some truth in that.

                             ELECTRA

               I don't need the money.

                             RATH

               This is something that is never

               going to end.  You can never work in

               the business again with this

               contract, because he will find you.

               To survive, you have to go into deep

               hiding.  And that's going to take

               money, a lot of money.

                             ELECTRA

               Then you can have the disks and I'll

               just walk out that door --

                             RATH

               If you walk out that door, Bain will

               still come after you.

                             ELECTRA

               Why?

                             RATH

               Because he took a contract on you.

               He'll come for you and he'll find

               you.

                             ELECTRA

               You don't know that -- you're trying

               to scare me.

                             RATH

               No.  It's the truth.  I know what

               you are.  Like me, like Bain, you're

               a ghost, you're not part of the real

               world.  You don't have a social

               security number.  You don't pay

               taxes.  You've probably used ten

               different names over the last ten

               years.  A long time ago something

               probably happened, something illegal

               and you ran, you disappeared and it

               was easy.  You think you can do it

               again.  But I'm telling you, fading

               from the law is nothing.  No matter

               what you do, where you go, I swear

               to you that Bain will find you.

                             ELECTRA

               How?

                             RATH

               Right now, as we sit here, he is

               tearing through your apartment.  He

               is digging through your drawers,

               emptying your closets.  He will take

               your telephone and address books,

               your appointment books.  If you keep

               a diary, he is reading it.  He'll go

               into the kitchen and find out what

               kind of food you eat, liquor you

               drink, cigarettes you smoke.  In the

               bathroom he will find any

               prescription drugs you take and

               where you get them filled.  If you

               have video tape or recordings he

               will watch and listen to all of

               them.

     She is coming unglued.  Imagining him watching her tapes,

     going through her possessions.  She is moving, pacing,

     ready to explode.

                             ELECTRA

               Oh Jesus Jesus...

                             RATH

               He will know everything about you.

               Everything.  I know, because I've

               done it.  Once you've been inside a

               mark's home, you're in their head.

               If you're any good, you'll find the

               mark in a week, and Bain is good

               because I was the best and I

               couldn't take him.

     She whirls and starts FIRING the GUN, firing it

     everywhere, fear and anger rocketing out of her in

     WHISTLING hot wads of LEAD.

     When she stops, he starts to say something but she levels

     the gun at him.

                             ELECTRA

               Shut up!  All right!  You've said

               enough!

     She forces herself back, grabbing handfuls of the sample

     bottles.

                             ELECTRA

               I need to think... To be alone.

     With the gun and an armful of booze and Nikita following

     at her feet, she goes into the bathroom and slams the

     door.

     INT. BATHROOM

     She locks the door and then collapses.  Her body seems to

     fold up onto itself as she slides down the wall; the GUN

     and the BOTTLES falling from her arms, CLATTERING SOFTLY

     on the bath rug as she buries her face in her hands.

     INT. BEDROOM

     Very mechanically, Rath begins setting up his chess board,

     putting the pieces into the same positions.  It is a

     ritual, and with it he enters a kind of trance.

     From the bathroom, almost inaudible, he hears Electra

     CRYING.

     INT. BATHROOM

     With her head now buried in her arms and knees, she is

     sobbing, her body rocking.  The crying seems very similar

     to Jennifer's; a complete emotional release.

     INT. BEDROOM

     Rath stares at the board.  The CRYING grows LOUDER.  He

     stands and walks to the door.  He starts to knock but

     stops himself.

     Like Electra with Jennifer, Rath would like to help, he

     just has no idea how to.  He turns back to the desk, to

     his chess game.

     INT. BATHROOM

     Her eyes are now burning red.  She stops crying long

     enough to suck down an entire sample of Scotch.  Nikita

     rubs against her and she strokes her.

                             ELECTRA

               Oh shit, Nikita.

     INT. BEDROOM

     Rath is setting up his computer system.  He hears the TUB

     FILLING UP.

     INT. BATHROOM

     Nikita jumps up onto the toilet seat and starts drinking.

                             ELECTRA

               Cheers.

     Electra finishes another sample and drops it to the floor

     where we see that many of the bottles are now empty.

     In the tub, steam rising off the surface, she wrings out a

     wash cloth and covers her face, sinking deeper into the

     water.

     INT. BEDROOM

     When Electra comes out of the bathroom, Rath is again at

     his chess game.  She sits down across from him and sets

     the gun on the table between them.

     Rath looks up at her.

                             ELECTRA

               Listen -- I don't even know your

               name.

                             RATH

               Rath.  Robert Rath.

                             ELECTRA

               Electra.

                             RATH

               Just Electra?

                             ELECTRA

               Yeah.

                             RATH

               As in daughter of Agamemnon?

                             ELECTRA

               No.  Just Electra.

     The conversation dies.

                             ELECTRA

               What I'm trying to say is that --

               I'm not sure I can do this, help

               you, unless I know more about you.

                             RATH

               What do you want to know?

                             ELECTRA

               If Bain hadn't taken the contract on

               me, would you have?

     He stares at her.

                             RATH

               No.

                             ELECTRA

               Why?

                             RATH

               Because I'm done.

                             ELECTRA

               This is crazy.  I can't trust you.

               You can't trust me.  How can we

               possibly help each other?

     They sit in silence, the gun and the chess game lying

     between them.

                             RATH

               Do you play?

     She looks at the chess board.

                             ELECTRA

               With computers.

                             RATH

               It's not the same, is it?

                             ELECTRA

               Better than playing with yourself.

     He smiles.

                             RATH

               I had an opponent.

     She understands that he is trying to tell her something.

                             ELECTRA

               Had?

                             RATH

               He was Russian.  Nicholai

               Tachlinkov.  A legend in the

               business when I was just starting.

               I admired him.  When I heard he

               loved chess I became obsessed with

               the game.

     Electra studies the board.

                             ELECTRA

               He was white?

     Rath nods.

                             ELECTRA

               It looks like white's game.

                             RATH

               We played with a code using 

The New

York Times

 obituaries.  Over three

               years we played twelve matches.  I

               never won.

                             ELECTRA

               Why didn't you finish this game?

     She reaches over and lifts a White Knight and takes a

     Bishop.  Rath counters, taking her Knight.

                             RATH

               He was... taken.

                             ELECTRA

               He was killed.

     Rath nods.

     Throughout the entire conversation they continue to play

     out the chess game.

                             ELECTRA

               By who?

     A long beat.

                             RATH

               I killed him.

                             ELECTRA

               Why?

                             RATH

               Because that's how it works.  That's

               what it's about.  He was the best.

               He was on top.

                             ELECTRA

               Where you wanted to be?

                             RATH

               Yes.  As soon as you get into this

               business, all you can think about is

               getting to the top.  That's all

               there is.  Until then, there is

               nothing.  You are nothing.

                             ELECTRA

               How did you get into the business?

                             RATH

               The same way everyone does; the

               government, the Agency.

                             ELECTRA

               The C.I.A.?

                             RATH

               More or less.

                             ELECTRA

               How old were you?

                             RATH

               They recruited me when I was in high

               school.

                             ELECTRA

               Jesus -- why?

                             RATH

               Languages.  I was already fluent in

               nine languages.

                             ELECTRA

               You were like a boy genius?

                             RATH

               Some people said that.  I never

               thought so.

                             ELECTRA

               Why not?

                             RATH

               I was just different.

                             ELECTRA

               You went from high school to the

               Agency?

                             RATH

               No.  I graduated from George

               Washington University.  Then I

               entered the Agency training program.

                             ELECTRA

               They didn't give you a choice, did

               they?

                             RATH

               No, they didn't.

                             ELECTRA

               But you knew what they were training

               you for?

                             RATH

               Of course.  I was going to be James

               Bond.

                             ELECTRA

               Ahhhh...

                             RATH

               They are very good at what they do.

               It's very seductive.  The training,

               the weapons, the travel --

                             ELECTRA

               The exotic women.

                             RATH

               Women?  No... not really.

                             ELECTRA

               Why not?

                             RATH

               Women... I don't... I don't want to

               talk about women.

                             ELECTRA

               Why?

                             RATH

               Because you are a women.

                             ELECTRA

               Why did you leave the Agency?

                             RATH

               The same reason everyone does.  You

               hear your name on C-SPAN and you

               realize you're a skeleton in

               someone's closet and they're coming

               to bury you.

                             ELECTRA

               They tried to kill you?

                             RATH

               Yes.  It didn't matter much to them

               as long as I disappeared.

                             ELECTRA

               Then you went freelance?

                             RATH

               The only thing different about the

               private sector is that a General

               Contractor takes less of a

               percentage than the government, so

               you make more money.  Then once you

               make the transition, you realize you

               were never working for the

               government; it was always the

               private sector, the vested interests

               and it's the same vested interests

               that continue to buy your plane

               tickets.

                             ELECTRA

               Tell me about the first time.

                             RATH

               My first take?

                             ELECTRA

               Yes.

                             RATH

               Why?

                             ELECTRA

               Because I want to know.

                             RATH

               It was... mechanical.  Very precise.

               It was exactly like the training

               drill except for the adrenaline.

                             ELECTRA

               Are they usually like that?

                             RATH

               No.  Just the first one.

                             ELECTRA

               After that?

                             RATH

               They become complicated... messy.

                             ELECTRA

               Did it ever bother you?

                             RATH

               Did it ever bother James Bond?

                             ELECTRA

               That's fiction.

                             RATH

               This is fiction!  Don't you see

               that?  This is another reality.  And

               the people that come into the world

               to play this game -- nobody forces

               them!  They're here, they know the

               rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do

               you understand what I am saying?  No

               one is innocent -- including you!

                             ELECTRA

               Does that mean it didn't bother you?

     Rath leans back and stares at her.  She waits.

                             RATH

               You get a job swinging a hammer, the

               first day you get a blister, it

               tears open, it bleeds and it stays

               sore a long time.  You keep swinging

               the hammer, you get a good hard

               callous that covers that spot and it

               never bothers you again.

     Electra says nothing.  He leans forward and slides a rook

     into her back row.

                             RATH

               Check.

     He leans back.

                             RATH

               Is that what you wanted to hear?

               Something cold blooded... something

               remorseless...

                             ELECTRA

               No.  Something honest.

     A beat.  Rath likes this woman.

     She moves her Queen.

                             ELECTRA

               Mate.

     He smiles.

                             ELECTRA

               I hope your plan is better than your

               game.

     INT. CHEAP HOTEL - NIGHT

     The room is ugly.  Shag carpeting, wood paneling and

     polyester patterned curtains.

     We hear a COMPUTER KEYBOARD CLICKING away as we MOVE

     ACROSS a table.  The hotel phone is in a modem, which is

     held together with duct tape.  Between the modem and the

     computer is a scrambler constructed out of a series of

     naked circuit boards.

     It is a very similar set up to Rath's, only it has been

     put together with a fraction of the resources.

     Bain sits, typing at the computer, his shirt off.  Beside

     the desk-top is a six pack of Old Style beer, a bag of

     Doritos and his Gameboy.

     On the floor, disassembled neatly on a small white towel

     is his cleaned gun.

     Bain finishes punching in a code, sits back and sucks down

     his beer.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

               Where have you been, Michael?

     He belches.

     He is communicating with his General Contractor.

     On the table is a collection of personal objects, much of

     it stuffed in pillow cases, taken from Electra's house.

                             BAIN/SCREEN

               Tracking the mark.

     Bain fingers a pair of satin panties.  He smiles as he

     smells them.

                             BAIN

               I'm on the scent.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

               You're too late.

     Bain slams his beer down.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

               I've learned from MicroCell, Rath

               fulfilled the contract.

                             BAIN/SCREEN

               How?

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

               He took out the mark and sold the

               disks back to MicroCell.

     Bain falls back in his chair, thinking.  He runs his hands

     through his sweaty hair.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

               Michael?

                             BAIN

               No.  No.  No.  I don't believe it.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

               They money will be standard bank

               transfer.  We believe we will know

               where and when.

                             BAIN

               What?

                             BAIN/SCREEN

               How?

     There is no response.

                             BAIN/SCREEN

               How in the fuck do you know that?

     A long beat.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

               Such language in front of a lady.

                             BAIN

               I don't give a fuck what you are.  I

               asked you --

     He hits the repeat key.

                             BAIN

                       (types)

               How in the fuck do you know that?

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

               Do you want Rath or not?

     Bain stares at the screen, thinking.  Thinking hard.

     INT. LARGE CHAIN HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

     Another computer screen, but we don't know that it is

     different.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

               It will take three days to arrange

               the transfer.

                             ELECTRA

               Three days?

     We are in Electra and Rath's hotel room.  She is standing

     behind him, reading as he types.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

               Which account?

                             ELECTRA

               Are you going to tell him?

                             RATH

               It.  Tell it.  For all I know it

               could be a machine.

                             ELECTRA

               You said you didn't trust it.

                             RATH

               I don't.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

               Which account?

                             ELECTRA

               What kind of bank is going to allow

               us to withdraw ten million dollars

               the day it is transferred?

                             RATH

               The kind preferred by drug

               smugglers, arms dealers and

               politicians.

     Rath types in an account number.

                             RATH

               Do you have a passport?

                             ELECTRA

               Several.

                             RATH

               Good.

                             ELECTRA

               Where is it?

                             RATH

               Mexico.

     INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

     Rath and Electra are sitting in the first class section,

     which she is obviously enjoying, smiling and sipping

     champagne.

                             ELECTRA

               God, I love first class.  I remember

               when I was a little girl, I would

               wonder what it was like up here.  I

               would always try to peek through the

               curtains.

     Rath says nothing, staring out the window.

     Electra shakes her head.

                             ELECTRA

               I hope Nikita's all right.

     He still does not respond.

                             ELECTRA

               Hey, where are you?

                             RATH

               Thinking.

                             ELECTRA

               About?

                             RATH

               Nothing.

     Electra sips the last of her champagne.

                             ELECTRA

               I've never been to the Gulf of

               Mexico.  Is it as nice as they say?

                             RATH

               I don't know.

                             ELECTRA

               You were there?

     A long beat.

                             RATH

               Yes.

     EXT. SMALL MEXICAN AIRPORT - DAY

     The plane lands.

     EXT. TERMINAL CAB STAND

     Rath and Electra hand their bags to a CABBY who puts them

     in his trunk.

     INT. CAB

     Rath speaks perfect Spanish.

                             RATH

                       (in Spanish)

               Good afternoon.  We have

               reservations at the Hotel Paraiso in

               Costa Blanca.

                             CABBY

                       (in Spanish)

               Yes, sir.

     EXT. HOTEL PARAISO - DAY

     The cab pulls up in front of a large, brand new glass

     hotel, which shimmers in the blue green reflection of the

     gulf water.

     Rath is upset.

                             RATH

                       (in Spanish)

               No, no.  I said the Hotel Paraiso.

                             CABBY

                       (in Spanish)

               Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso.

                             RATH

                       (in Spanish)

               No, the other Hotel Paraiso, in the

               city.  Near the Plaza del Sol.

                             CABBY

                       (in Spanish)

               I'm sorry, sir.  A year ago there

               was a fire in the old Hotel Paraiso.

               This is the new Hotel Paraiso.

                             RATH

                       (in Spanish)

               Take us there.

     EXT. COSTA BLANCA - DAY

     American tourist dollars have built up the coasts, but

     much of the out-lying city is very poor.

     The old Hotel Paraiso is a five story blackened husk.  The

     face of the building is burnt black and it seems to hang

     in space as something non-corporeal, like the shadow of

     the building rather than the building itself.

     Rath stares at it, remembering.

     Electra is behind him, standing in the midst of the Plaza

     del Sol.

     He looks up to the fifth story window, then turns directly

     opposite of that.

     The International Banco de Mexico, an enormous, beautiful

     old building; its exterior walls are white-washed

     concrete, blindingly bright white.

     Electra looks at the bank and smiles.

                             ELECTRA

               So, that's where all that S & L

               money is?

     Rath is not listening to her.  He is somewhere else.  He

     turns back to the fourth story window.

                             RATH

               That's where he'll be.

                             ELECTRA

               What?

                             RATH

               I wasn't expecting this.  I need to

               think.

     EXT. HOTEL PARAISO - NIGHT

     Beyond the lights of the hotel the gulf darkens to

     midnight oil.

     INT. HOTEL PARAISO ELEVATOR

     On one side of the elevator is a young couple who look

     like newlyweds.  They are cuddling, kissing and giggling

     as though they are alone.

     Electra and Rath are on the other side of the elevator.

     It is a strange contrast.

     Electra is staring at them.

     Rath, behind his sunglasses, is in his own world.

     The ELEVATOR CHIMES and opens.

     Nobody moves.

     The DOORS CHIME again and start to close, as everyone

     realizes that this is their floor.

     Rath and the other man grab the doors, which spring back

     open.

     It is a funny, awkward moment, as everyone apologizes and

     smiles politely, on the way out.

     INT. HALL

     The couple move down the hall, the newlyweds finding their

     door first.

     Rath reaches the door to their room, opens it and enters.

     Electra lingers, watching the other couple, watching as he

     fumbles for his keys, her hand running up between his legs

     and over his ass.

     He finally manages to open the door and she pushes him

     inside.

     Electra softly closes her door.

     INT. HOTEL PARAISO - HOTEL ROOM

     Rath is sitting in a desk chair staring out of the sliding

     balcony doors at the dark gulf water.

                             ELECTRA

               Did you see them?

     Electra moves about the large suite.

                             ELECTRA

               They looked like they were in love.

     Rath says nothing.

                             ELECTRA

               Well, I think I'll take a bath.

               Come on, Nikita!

     The two of them walk into the bathroom, leaving Rath to

     himself.

     INT. BATHROOM

     Electra sits on the edge of the over-sized tub, water

     running through her fingers as she adjusts the

     temperature.

     After a beat she hears a SMALL CRASH, a GLASS BREAKING.

     It is followed by other MUFFLED NOISES, a WOMAN GIGGLING

     and a THUMPING.  The sounds are coming from the other side

     of the tub wall, from the other suite.  Electra puts her

     ear against the tile to listen.

     The WATER FILLING her TUB is too loud for her to hear.

     She turns it OFF.

     There is more BUMPING and THUMPING, the WOMAN LAUGHING and

     then, the LAUGHS SHORTEN into SOFT WHIMPERS.

     Electra hangs on each sound, slowly lifted by it, moving

     up toward the over-head fan and ducts.

     The SOUNDS get LOUDER as she moves closer to the vents,

     until she is standing precariously on the edge of the tub,

     listening to what is clearly the sounds of TWO PEOPLE

     MAKING LOVE.

     Their MOANS and SHRIEKS CLIMAX and Electra smiles.

     INT. BEDROOM

     It is dark now.  A single desk light is on, under which

     Rath is setting up his chess board, putting the pieces in

     their familiar pattern.

     Electra comes out of the bathroom.  She seems very clean

     and fresh, wearing a long white T-shirt and thin robe.

                             ELECTRA

               That felt great.  You should try it.

     She watches him setting the pieces onto the board.

                             ELECTRA

               Don't you ever get tired of playing

               the same game?

     He looks at her.

                             RATH

               No.

                             ELECTRA

               Why not?

                             RATH

               It helps me to focus.  It centers

               me, helps me think.

                             ELECTRA

               Oh.  What do you think about?

                             RATH

               Work.  The things I need to get

               done.

     She sits across from him looking at the board.

                             ELECTRA

               Do you think about the game?

                             RATH

               Yes.

                             ELECTRA

               But you've never figured out a way

               to win.

                             RATH

               No.

                             ELECTRA

               Not even a stalemate?

                             RATH

               No.

                             ELECTRA

               What happens if you do?

     This strikes Rath as a very strange question and he is

     suddenly annoyed by her.

                             ELECTRA

               Can I ask you something?

     He knows she will anyway.

                             ELECTRA

               What will you do if this works, if

               we get the money?

                             RATH

               I don't know... maybe I'll live on a

               boat, sail to all the places I've

               never been.

                             ELECTRA

               That sounds nice.

     He finishes his glass of bourbon.

     She is not sure what to say next, if she should say

     anything at all.

                             ELECTRA

               I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like

               to try and get some sleep.

                             RATH

               You can have the bed.  The chair is

               fine for me.

     He pours himself another drink, dropping in some ice from

     the ice bucket.

                             ELECTRA

               Thanks.

     She slips out of the robe and in between the sheets.

     Rath sits across the room, his back to her.

     She tries to make herself comfortable, but cannot.

                             ELECTRA

               Do you think he's here?

                             RATH

               Here?

                             ELECTRA

               In Costa Blanca.

                             RATH

               Yes.

     She thinks.

                             ELECTRA

               What do you think he's doing?

                             RATH

               I don't know... But I'm sure he's

               not sleeping.

     She pulls the covers tightly to her chin.  Her eyes do not

     close.

     INT. HOTEL (COSTA BLANCA) - NIGHT

     A small hotel in the city, away from the beaches, built

     before there was such a thing as central air conditioning.

     Bain is naked, except for a small pair of camouflage

     jockeys and his Walkman strapped to his shoulder.  His

     head is pumping wildly with the speed metal thrashing in

     his ears.

     He is tearing open a long box wrapped in "Happy Birthday"

     paper.

     Inside the box is a massive black hi-tech assault rifle.

     He smiles.

     He assembles it quickly, snapping it together with

     automatic ease.  When the sight is tightened in place, he

     jumps up.

     In the mirror over the dresser, he poses down with the

     gun.

     Not satisfied, he grabs his shades and checks himself

     again.  He starts moving with the music, playing with the

     gun, first as a guitar, then whipping it around, spinning

     it expertly, like a drum and bugle corpsman.  The gun zips

     and flashes around as he whirls in place, then freezes.

     The butt of the rifle to his shoulder, he peers down the

     scope at his own head reflected in the mirror.  He is

     sweating and breathing, but the barrel does not move.

                             BAIN

               You're dead, motherfucker.

     EXT. HOTEL PARAISO - DAY

     Electra leans out over the railing, smiling, inhaling the

     warm air, the scent of the shimmering blue-green sea.

     Rath stands in the shadow of the door frame.

                             RATH

               Breakfast.

                             ELECTRA

               Why don't you bring it out here?

               It's beautiful out here.

     Rath steps a little farther out.  He looks down either

     side of the building, checking sight lines.  He looks out

     and sees another hotel with windows facing them.

     He turns to her.  Says nothing.  Moves back inside.

     INT. HOTEL ROOM

     The breakfast trays are empty.  Rath is sipping coffee,

     scribbling notes and diagrams on a piece of paper.

     Electra comes out of the bathroom dressed for the beach.

     He stops working.

                             ELECTRA

               I know what you are thinking.  I'm

               not going to disappear, okay?  I'm

               not going anywhere, just down there,

               to that beautiful beach.  I got to

               get out of this room, just for a

               little while.

                             RATH

               Okay.

                             ELECTRA

               Really?

                             RATH

               He won't be looking for you.  Just

               be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your

               sunglasses on.

                             ELECTRA

               Book.  Sunglasses.  Great.

     INT. HOTEL HALL

     Electra steps out of the hotel room ready for the beach.

     At the end of the hall, she sees the newlywed couple get

     on the elevator.  She starts to call to them to hold it

     for her, but she stops herself.

     The elevator closes.

     She edges slowly down the hall, stopping outside the door

     to their suite.  She touches it with the tips of her

     fingers.

     INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     Rath is still at the table.

     The curtain begins to billow, a soft breeze blowing

     through the open patio door.  They swell open and fall.

     It seems for a moment that there is a figure, a shadow, in

     the changing shape of the curtain.

     Rath stands.  He walks to the open door.  Standing in the

     frame, he looks out at the blue ocean below.

     He slides the door closed, and the curtains fall still.

     EXT. PLAZA DEL SOL - DAY

     Bain moves through the market, booths lining the edges of

     the plaza.  His eyes shift rapidly behind his sunglasses.

     He buys an apricot and strolls into the center of the

     plaza.

     He looks at the bank, at the military-style security

     guards that patrol the front.

     He turns in the plaza, checking the perimeter, his gaze

     falling on the tall, burned-out building.

     He looks back at the bank, imagining the sight line.

     He bites into the apricot, its juice gushing, running down

     his chin.

     INT. HOTEL ROOM

     Rath is leaning back in the bed, NIKITA PURRING in his

     lap.

     He did not sleep last night and is very tired.  His eyes

     fight to stay open.

     The sound of the TELEVISION momentarily hangs in the hotel

     room as he sleeps.  The program is a SPANISH DUBBED

     version of GOLDFINGER.

     The door bangs open and Rath springs off the bed, a gun

     flashing in his hand, leveling it at a dazed, blinking

     Electra.

     Rath sighs slowly, letting the hammer of the GUN CLICK

     back into place.

                             RATH

               You should knock.

                             ELECTRA

               Sorry.

                             RATH

               How was the beach?

                             ELECTRA

               The beach?  It was nice.

     She smiles.

     EXT. HOTEL PARAISO - DUSK

     The sun burns a tropical red against the mirrored windows

     of the hotel.

     INT. HOTEL ROOM

     Electra is sitting on the bed, her back against the wall.

     In her hands is a paperback romance novel that she is

     looking over the top of, staring intensely across the

     room.

     We can hear Rath, his breathing deep and even.  He is

     doing Tai Chi, wearing only his boxer shorts.  His body is

     coated in a sheen of sweat, his muscles strained as he

     moves fluidly through space.

     Electra begins to breath with him.

     She moves her body slightly, her hips rising as though to

     meet his.

     He empties his lungs entirely in one exhale and stops, his

     eyes closed, rested.

                             ELECTRA

               That was beautiful.

     He looks at her.

                             ELECTRA

               Tai Chi, right?

     He nods.

                             ELECTRA

               Where did you learn it?

                             RATH

               Taiwan.

                             ELECTRA

               Not that I would know, but you look

               like you're really good at it.

                             RATH

               Thank you.

                             ELECTRA

               I've always wanted to learn

               something like that.

                             RATH

               You should.  It's very important,

               that the body release the energy

               that builds in it.

     Electra nods, watching him bend, reaching for a change of

     clothes.

                             RATH

               I'm going to shower.  If you're

               hungry, go ahead and order some

               dinner.

     Electra nods again.

     INT. COSTA BLANCA HOTEL - NIGHT

     Bain is doing push ups.  He is naked except for his

     camouflage bikinis.

     He has his feet up on a chair, making it harder, the dip

     deeper.

     His body is gushing sweat, his face a burning red.

     He is like a piston firing up and down.  The muscles in

     his neck and shoulders are bulging cords.

     Slowly, his arm begin to tire, the strain seen in his

     knotting and twisting expression.

     Half way up, he collapses, feet falling off the chair.

     He rolls onto his back, rubbing a tricep.  It hurts.  He

     licks the sweat off his upper lip and smiles.

     INT. HOTEL PARAISO ROOM - NIGHT

     Rath checks his watch.  It's after eight o'clock.  He

     lifts the phone and plugs it into the modem.

                             RATH

               I'm going to call.

     Electra drops her book and climbs off the bed.

     He dials, types the code and waits.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

               Hello, Robert.

                             RATH/SCREEN

               The contract?

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

               Paid in full.

                             ELECTRA

               Oh, my God.  Ten million dollars.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

               Transferred to the specified

               account.

     Rath stares at the screen.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

               Goodbye, Robert.

     Rath disconnects.  The PHONE HUMS.

     Electra picks it up, placing it back in the cradle.

                             RATH

               Sit down.

     She does.

     He opens a case and pulls out his gun, some paper and pens

     and two small mikes that look like hearing aids.

                             RATH

               Okay --

     He starts drawing several squares on the paper, as Electra

     picks up the mike.  She looks over it, frowns.

                             ELECTRA

               Two way?

                             RATH

               Transmits and receives.

                             ELECTRA

               Cheap as shit.

     He looks at her.

                             RATH

               I paid a lot for these.

                             ELECTRA

               They saw you coming a mile away.  If

               I had known we'd be using --

                             RATH

               It's too late now.  Okay?  We'll have

               to deal with these.

                             ELECTRA

               Fine.

     He goes back to his drawing.

                             RATH

               This is the bank.  This is the

               hotel.  In the morning I will enter

               the bank.

                             ELECTRA

               Check.

                             RATH

               He will be hidden somewhere out

               here, probably somewhere low, in the

               crowd.  He'll stay there until he

               sees me enter the bank.

                             ELECTRA

               But he won't shoot you right then?

                             RATH

               No.  It would be amateur.  A risk.

               He'll wait for the prime shot, that

               he knows is coming.  Once I'm

               inside, he'll move to the hotel.

               He'll go up the back, too much

               traffic in the front.

     He draws another square.

                             RATH

               You'll be here.  A restaurant.  A

               public place far enough away that he

               won't notice you, but with a good

               enough view you'll be able to see

               him when he moves inside.

                             ELECTRA

               Okay.  Then what?

                             RATH

               Then, we wait.

                             ELECTRA

               Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know

               if I like this plan.

                             RATH

               It will take the entire day, but he

               will begin to doubt himself.  He

               will begin to believe that he missed

               me, that somehow I slipped by and am

               already on a plane to Europe.

     He describes this as though remembering it.

                             RATH

               The sun will be low, almost dark,

               the air cool and the bank will

               almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  He

               will put the rifle down, he will get

               up and he will walk across the plaza

               to the bank.

                             ELECTRA

               Why won't he wait until the bank

               closes?

                             RATH

               He won't be able to.  He'll have to

               go inside.  He'll have to see with

               his own eyes, whether or not I am

               there.  If the bank closes, he won't

               know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm

               sure.  And when he does you'll go

               into the hotel, go upstairs and take

               the gun.

                             ELECTRA

               What?  What if he brings it with

               him?

     He shakes his head.

                             RATH

               He can't.  The bank has an expensive

               security system; metal detectors and

               X-ray machines.

                             ELECTRA

               That means you won't have a gun.

                             RATH

               That's right.

                             ELECTRA

               And with the mikes, I'll tell you

               when he leaves the hotel and you'll

               tell me when he leaves the bank.

                             RATH

               If things go well, I don't have to.

               You'll already be in a rented car

               waiting for me.

                             ELECTRA

               You'll have the money.  How do I

               know that you won't --

                             RATH

               I'll be walking out of the bank,

               unarmed.  You'll have the gun and

               I'll drive the car.

                             ELECTRA

               We split the money?

                             RATH

               Five million apiece.  You get on

               your plane, I get on mine.

                             ELECTRA

               Sounds pretty well figured out.

                             RATH

               I've been thinking about it for a

               long time.

                             ELECTRA

               Except --

                             RATH

               What?

                             ELECTRA

               Except, if he doesn't come out of

               the hotel.

                             RATH

               I told you, he will.

                             ELECTRA

               You can't know for sure, how can

               you?  I mean, you're not him.

                             RATH

               I was.

     She waits for him to explain.

                             RATH

               Ten years ago, I sat there in that

               same hotel window, sweat pouring off

               of me waiting --

                             ELECTRA

               For Nicholai?

                             RATH

               Yes.

                             ELECTRA

               You killed him here?  In this city,

               outside that bank?

     Rath nods.

                             ELECTRA

               What is it?  I don't like this at

               all.  What is going on here?

                             RATH

               I don't know.  It just happened.  I

               was here ten years ago, I'm here

               now.  That's it.

                             ELECTRA

               I don't believe that.

                             RATH

               It wasn't planned or premeditated.

               I swear.  Things happened beyond my

               control.  I understood; I saw where

               they were leading and I suppose that

               it just made sense.

                             ELECTRA

               Ten years ago.

                             RATH

               Yes.

                             ELECTRA

               What happened?

                             RATH

               I waited until I was insane and then

               I walked into the bank.  He was

               sitting there, very calm, waiting

               for me.

                             ELECTRA

               What did he want?

                             RATH

               He wanted what I want now; to get

               out of the business.  To disappear

               to some empty Greek island.

                             RATH

               What did he say?

                             RATH

               He said I couldn't win.  That no one

               wins at this game.

                             ELECTRA

               Was that it?

                             RATH

               Then he offered me one million

               dollars to walk away, to quit the

               business.

                             ELECTRA

               You didn't take it.

                             RATH

               No.  I went back to the hotel.  And

               waited.

                             ELECTRA

               Ten years later, here you are again.

                             RATH

               Yes.  Here I am again.

     POV - THROUGH TELESCOPIC LENS - MARBLE STATUE

     The cross-hairs of a telescopic sight are lined-up on the

     head of a marble statue.

     INT. COSTA BLANCA HOTEL - NIGHT

     Bain is laying on the floor in the dark.  The rifle is

     under him as he aims out of his balcony, down the street

     at the statue.

     He looks up from the scope, checking the street.  It is

     dark and empty and he shifts back looking into the sight.

     His finger squeezes, the GUN ALMOST SILENT, as --

     INTERCUT WITH:

     STATUE

     A chunk of STONE EXPLODES out the head of the statue.

     Again, the GUN SPITS and another cloud of dust and ROCK

     BURSTS from the head.  His finger is pumping the trigger,

     until the head cracks and falls.

     He's laughing, hysterical, looking down the street at the

     headless statue.

     He rolls onto his side still laughing.  Then, suddenly, he

     stops, staring up at the stars in the night sky.

     INT. HOTEL PARAISO ROOM - NIGHT

     Electra is still at the table, staring at the diagrams, in

     another world.

     Rath pours a glass of bourbon and sets it in front of her.

                             ELECTRA

               This has been the longest day of my

               life.

     Rath nods, pouring himself a drink.  Electra looks at the

     drink, downs the whole glass.  He refills it.

                             ELECTRA

               Do you have ulcers?

                             RATH

               No.

                             ELECTRA

               I think I got one today.

                             RATH

               Five million dollars will buy a lot

               of Rolaids.

     She smiles.  They both gulp down their drinks and he fills

     them again.

                             ELECTRA

               What do you suppose he's doing now?

     Rath shrugs.  He is no longer looking at her; staring at

     the board, moving his mind into the chess game.

     She watches him and then begins to study it with him, the

     way a child does, almost imitating him.  She does not want

     to be left alone right now.

     She reaches over and moves a white knight.

     He blinks.  His eyes shifting, sorting the possibilities.

     He picks a bishop and counters.

     After another sequence, he takes her bishop and she takes

     his knight.

                             RATH

               Why did you trade a bishop for a

               knight?

                             ELECTRA

               I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I

               like knights.

                             RATH

               They're worth less points.

                             ELECTRA

               So?

     There is no point in arguing.

     As they continue to play, we begin to hear in the

     distance, the COUPLE in the adjoining suite MAKING very

     vigorous LOVE.

     Electra watches Rath to see if he hears them.  He shows no

     sign of it, concentrating on the game.

                             ELECTRA

               Do you hear them?

     He looks up.

                             ELECTRA

               Listen.

     He hears it.  Not interested.

                             ELECTRA

               Did you think they were newlyweds?

                             RATH

               I didn't notice them.

                             ELECTRA

               When I first saw them I thought they

               were married.

                             RATH

               How do you know they're not?

                             ELECTRA

               I went into their room this

               afternoon.

                             RATH

               What?

                             ELECTRA

               It was no big deal.  I saw them

               leave, I went in.

                             RATH

               Jesus, if someone had --

                             ELECTRA

               Nobody ever sees me.   

                             RATH

               Why in the hell would you take that

               chance?

                             ELECTRA

               I heard them last night and it made

               me want to know something about

               them.  I wanted to, so I did.

     Rath shakes his head.  In the b.g., the WOMAN is ALMOST

     SCREAMING.

                             ELECTRA

               She is married, but not to him.

               Another man, much older.  She has

               four kids.  The young guy works for

               her.  And I think she likes kinky

               sex.

                             RATH

               Thank you.

                             ELECTRA

               Isn't it interesting though?  I

               mean, look at us, in this room.  Or

               yesterday, when we were walking in

               the plaza market.  I mean, we look

               like just another couple.  But what

               are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?

                             RATH

               No.

                             ELECTRA

               No?

                             RATH

               It's always been that way.  The

               world has always functioned on two

               levels.

                             ELECTRA

               I know.  It makes me crazy.

                             RATH

               Why?

                             ELECTRA

               I don't know.  When I was in

               college, I was forced to go to a

               psychiatrist because I was caught

               drilling holes in my dorm room

               floor.

                             RATH

               And you were drilling these

               holes...?

                             ELECTRA

               So I could watch the girl that lived

               under me.

                             RATH

               Apparently this doctor was unable to

               cure you.

                             ELECTRA

               He told me that my curiosity became

               unnaturally entangled with my sense

               of self-preservation.

                             RATH

               Did he explain how this happened?

                             ELECTRA

               He believed it all went back to one

               night, when as a little girl.  I

               watched my parents have this big

               fight, really big.  I thought my

               mother was going to kill my father.

               Then they went into their room and

               made up.  And I watched them make

               love through the keyhole.

     The WOMAN SCREAMS a final time in CLIMAX.

     Electra moves her queen, taking his other knight.

                             RATH

               What are you doing?

                             ELECTRA

               What?

                             RATH

               That's a ridiculous move.

                             ELECTRA

               Why?

                             RATH

               Because, I'll take it.

                             ELECTRA

               I'm playing white, remember.  You

               can't tell me which pieces to move.

               It doesn't work that way.

     He shrugs and takes her queen, the game continuing.

                             ELECTRA

               Can I ask you something?

                             RATH

               I'm sure you will.

                             ELECTRA

               Am I attractive?

     This gets his attention.

                             RATH

               Yes.

                             ELECTRA

               Are you attracted to me?

                             RATH

               Yes.

                             ELECTRA

               Why?

                             RATH

               Why?  I don't know.

                             ELECTRA

               Is it a physical thing, or a mental

               thing?

                             RATH

               Both.

     A good answer.  Electra smiles.

                             ELECTRA

               Is that why you didn't want to talk

               about women before?

                             RATH

               I didn't want to complicate the

               situation.

                             ELECTRA

               Attraction is a complication?

                             RATH

               It can be.

                             ELECTRA

               It happened to you before?

                             RATH

               Yes.

                             ELECTRA

               Who was she?

                             RATH

               Someone like me, like you.  A pro.

                             ELECTRA

               What happened to her?

                             RATH

               She was taken.

                             ELECTRA

               Did you --

                             RATH

               No.  I tried to stop it.  I

               couldn't.

                             ELECTRA

               Was she the only one?

                             RATH

               After her, I realized that to

               survive I had to live without...

               It's dangerous to let things become

               complicated.

                             ELECTRA

               Is this becoming complicated?

                             RATH

               I'm not sure that I care anymore.

     He looks up from the game.

                             ELECTRA

               Were you attracted to me right away?

                             RATH

               No.

                             ELECTRA

               When did it start?

                             RATH

               Honestly?

                             ELECTRA

               Uh-huh.

                             RATH

               When I gave you my gun and you

               almost shot me.

                             ELECTRA

               Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.

                             RATH

               Why?

                             ELECTRA

               That doesn't sound normal.

                             RATH

               I'm not normal.

                             ELECTRA

               I know.  That's why I'm attracted to

               you.  I mean, you make me nervous.

               You're intimidating.  Maybe it's my

               curiosity/self-preservation thing,

               but all I can really think about

               right now is kissing you.

     They rise up from the table, together, knocking over the

     chess game.  The pieces fall to the floor.

     They grab at each other, kissing, both of them hungry,

     aggressive.  They tear at each other's clothes and at

     their own clothes; it has a very awkward sense to it, as

     they become naked in front of each other.  There is

     nothing smooth or fluid about it, which makes it seem very

     real.

     He takes her, lifting her onto the table.

     She scoots and wiggles back, the chess pieces falling out

     of the way.

     She opens her legs and he moves in between them.

                             ELECTRA

               I wanted to tell you --

     Her breath rushes out, then back in.

                             ELECTRA

               My real name is Anna.

     He smiles.

                             RATH

               Martin.

                             ELECTRA

               Martin.

     Her legs wrap up around his hips and he pushes deeper into

     her.

                             ELECTRA

               Nice to meet you, Martin.

     INT. HOTEL PARAISO - HALL - NIGHT

     Outside of the room, we can hear the MUFFLED SOUNDS of TWO

     PEOPLE MAKING LOVE.

     EXT. COSTA BLANCA - NIGHT

     We are MOVING DOWN the street, LOW, OVER the old

     flagstones, TOWARDS the marble statue that Bain shot.

     On the ground are the shattered pieces of the head.

     CLOSER

     We see one of the pieces is part of the face, the eyes,

     which seem like the iris-less eyes of a chess king.

     CLOSER

     We MOVE INTO the blank white of that eye.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     WHITE SQUARE GLOSSED WITH LIGHT

     We PULL BACK, RISING UP and AWAY, and see other squares,

     black and white like a chess board.

     A woman's HIGH HEELS CLICK past.

     RISING HIGHER, we see the woman walking.  A man crosses

     behind her, in another direction.

     HIGHER STILL, and we realize that we are looking at the

     black and white marble floor of the --

     INT. INTERNATIONAL BANCO DE MEXICO - DAY

     It is a strange and beautiful bank.

     The ceilings are vast, the suspended lights elaborate,

     baroque, the enormous clock on the wall, built to resemble

     a sun.

     It looks almost as though it could be a museum, with its

     massive oil paintings and bronze statues of important

     Mexican figures.

     Already it is crowded, people and security guards moving

     about beneath us.

     Rath steps onto the checkered floor and remembers.

     EXT. OUTDOOR CAFE

     The cafe is off the plaza.

     Electra sits at a patio table.  Down the street she can

     see the back of the burned-out hotel.

     She hears Rath in her ear-piece.

                             RATH (V.O.)

               All right.  I'm in the bank.  He'll

               move now.  How are you doing?

     She is nervous.

                             ELECTRA

               I'm ready.

     INT. BANK

                             RATH

               Good.

     Rath is wearing a well-tailored, gray silk suit and dark

     sunglasses.  In his hand is a very large briefcase.  He

     crosses the checkered floor to the teller windows.

                             TELLER

               May I help you?

                             RATH

               Yes.  Could you check on a transfer

               for me?

                             TELLER

               Your name, or account?

                             RATH

               Rath.  Robert Rath.

     EXT. CAFE

     Electra smiles when she hears him, mouthing the name

     "Martin."

     INT. BANK

     A BANK OFFICIAL walks over to the window, carrying a

     printed receipt, with a very bright smile.

                             OFFICIAL

               Senor Rath, we have received your

               transfer.

     He hands Rath the receipt.  He glances at it, checking the

     zeros.  There are seven of them.

                             RATH

               Good.  Now I'll need to close this

               account.  I'd like you to ready the

               paperwork.

     The smile fades.

                             OFFICIAL

               You wish to close this account

               today?

                             RATH

               That's correct.

                             OFFICIAL

               How would you like the funds?

               I have all day.

     EXT. CAFE

     Electra looks up over her book and Bain is there, moving

     down the side street, gliding through the crowd with the

     menacing indifference of a shark.

     INT. BANK

     The Official is talking to the teller in Spanish, when

     Electra whispers in Rath's ear.

                             ELECTRA

               He's here.

     Rath freezes.

     EXT. CAFE

     Electra watches as Bain moves along the plywood wall,

     covered with bills and posters, built to keep people out

     of the burned hotel.  He is carrying a long nylon duffel

     bag.

     At the corner, a section of the plywood has been pulled

     loose and Bain squeezes through, into the hotel.

                             ELECTRA

               He's inside.

     INT. BANK

     Rath is sitting in one of the high backed leather chairs

     set in pairs along the wall of the bank.

     He glances at the enormous clock, which reads 10:10.  He

     checks his Rolex.

                             RATH

               Now, we wait.

     INT. BURNED HOTEL PARAISO

     The center of the hotel is open.  Interior hall balconies,

     which line each floor, look down onto an old atrium

     courtyard.  The fire did the most damage here, spreading

     easily throughout the entire building.

     The skylight and ceiling at the top of this open area, has

     been destroyed and sunlight streams through throwing

     broken patterns of shadow and light onto the blackened

     floors and walls.

     Bain enters, and carefully begins climbing the charred

     staircase to the fifth floor.

     INT. BURNED HOTEL ROOM

     The room has been heavily burned, stained black from

     smoke.  The charred carpet crunches and cracks, as Bain

     walks across it to the window.

     As he nears the exterior wall, several FLOOR BOARDS BREAK

     with a brittle SNAP and he almost falls through.

                             BAIN

               Shit.

     He pulls his leg free.

     Outside the window, across the plaza, he sees the bank; a

     perfect site.

     Quickly he unzips the bag and lifts out the gun.

     He grabs a magazine and snaps it into place.

     He aims down at the bank's bright white stairs.  A man is

     walking down the steps and Bain finds the center of his

     forehead in the cross-hairs of the scope.

     Bain makes a gun noise, followed by the sound of a head

     bursting open.

     He giggles.

     Leaning against the wall, in the shadows of the window,

     the gun in his lap, he waits.

     Time slows to a crawl.

     Without taking his eye from the bank, Bain rummages

     through his bag and finds a pack of cigarettes.  He pulls

     one out with his lips and lights it.

     Taking a deep drag, he lets the smoke slowly leak out and

     drift up into the night.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     SUN

     White hot.

     INT. BURNED HOTEL ROOM

     There are five cigarette butts ground into the blackened

     window sill, where Bain extinguishes another.

                             BAIN

               What in the fuck are you doing in

               there?

     The room is hot, a streak of sweat up his back and front.

     It is difficult to breathe.

     A man walks out of the bank, wearing a suit similar to

     Rath's.  Bain's body snaps erect, rifle instantly leveled.

     He sights the man's head, his finger tightening on the

     trigger, but he is not sure it is Rath.

     He looks over the scope, looks back.  The man reaches the

     bottom of the stairs.  Bain's body sags.

                             BAIN

               That's not him.  Jesus, Bain, baby,

               chill the fuck out.

     He takes a deep breath and wipes the sweat from his

     forehead, leaving a smear of black from the charcoal wood.

     He again fumbles through his bag, finding a container of

     bottled water.  He chugs the whole thing.

     INT. BANK

     The Official walks over to Rath with a number of papers to

     sign.

                             OFFICIAL

               Your signature, senor.  Everything

               is ready.

     Rath signs them, but does not get up.

                             OFFICIAL

               Excellent, senor.  If you could

               follow me?

                             RATH

               I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an

               associate.  Can you hold everything

               for me until he arrives?

                             OFFICIAL

               Of course, senor.

                             RATH

               Thank you.

     EXT. CAFE

     Electra is sipping at some iced tea, dizzy at the thought

     of all that money.

                             ELECTRA

               Ten million dollars, sitting there.

               Waiting... this is insane.

     INT. BANK

     There is a faint smile on Rath's lips.

     EXT. PLAZA

     The shadows are getting longer.

     INT. BURNED HOTEL ROOM

     Bain is rocking back and forth, breathing through his

     teeth.  He has to urinate.  Bad.

     He is checking every face that comes out of the bank with

     the scope.  Still nothing.

                             BAIN

               This is fucking insane.

     He grabs the empty plastic bottle, unzips his pants and

     begins refilling it.

     A man in a suit appears on the steps and Bain fumbles the

     bottle, spilling it as he lifts the gun.  It is not Rath.

                             BAIN

               Fucking God dammit!

     He hurls the bottle of piss across the room.

     INT. BANK

     The sun clock on the wall, perfectly still, reads 5:20.

     After a long beat a single minute clicks off.

     INT. BURNED HOTEL ROOM

     The sun is getting low.  The room much darker now.

     Bain sits at the window; his body a knot.

     A large group of tourists flow out of the bank and Bain's

     eyes light up.  One by one, the scope passes over each

     face.

     They trickle down the steps and into the plaza.

     The stairs are again empty.

     Bain screams, pounding the butt of the gun down, splitting

     open the floor.

     He looks at the bank.  Nothing.  He checks his watch.  In

     fifteen minutes the bank will close.

     He stands up.

     EXT. CAFE

     Electra is watching the back of the hotel, when Bain

     emerges from the shadows.

                             ELECTRA

               Oh my God.

     He is moving like a bullet, knocking into people who don't

     get out of his way.

                             ELECTRA

               He's coming.

     INT. BANK

     Rath looks up at the clock, smiles.

                             RATH

               Four minutes.

                             RATH

               I waited another four minutes.

                             ELECTRA

               Shit.

                             RATH

               Wait until he is on the stairs.

                             ELECTRA

               Right.

                             RATH

               I'm taking off my mike.

               Electra --

                             ELECTRA

               What?

                             RATH

               Last night --

     EXT. CAFE

     Electra smiles.

                             ELECTRA

               Was nice.

                             RATH

               Yes.

     She sees Bain storming up the stairs.  She stands, tosses

     several bills on the table and leaves.

     INT. BANK

     Bain charges into the bank, tearing off his sunglasses,

     scanning the room.  His face is a twisted grimace,

     streaked with black charcoal.  His body and clothes are

     covered in sweat and large salt rings.  His breathing

     labored.

     He sees Rath sitting comfortably, calm, his suit not even

     wrinkled and realizes that Rath has been waiting for him.

     His first instinct is to turn and run, but he stops

     himself.  He is confused, unsure.

     Then, as though understanding he has no choice, he puts

     his sunglasses back on and strides over to Rath, BOOTS

     CLICKING against the polished MARBLE.

     Bain sits down in the leather chair across from him.

                             BAIN

               How'd you know?  Just tell me that.

               How'd you fucking know?

                             RATH

               I knew the same way in ten years

               you're going to know.

                             BAIN

               What does that fucking mean?

                             RATH

               It means that I'm going to tell you

               things, even though I already know

               that you're not going to listen to a

               God damned thing I say.

     INT. BURNED HOTEL

     Electra carefully moves up to the fifth floor, then

     navigates around a large hole, towards the last room.

     INT. BANK

                             RATH

               It's irony.  That's what it is.  But

               the real irony is that you won't

               know it's irony until you're sitting

               over here.

     Bain isn't listening.  Instead he's watching, everyone who

     walks near them.

                             RATH

               When you walked in here and you saw

               me, sitting here, waiting; the first

               thing that went through your head

               was that you were a dead man.

     This catches Bain's ear.

                             RATH

               You're thinking that you've been

               sold out.  That's the only way I

               could know you were out there.  Why

               would you think this?  Because you

               don't trust your contractor.  You

               don't trust anyone.  It's automatic.

               It's the first and last commandment.

               It's the only thing that keeps you

               alive.  So, try as I might to tell

               you the truth, you can't believe me.

               Do you see the irony of the

               situation?  It's kind of funny,

               isn't it?

     Bain is not laughing.

     INT. BURNED HOTEL ROOM

     Inside the burned out closet, Electra finds Bain's nylon

     duffel bag.

     Digging through it, she finds his Gameboy, his Walkman,

     his .22, ammunition clips and several issues of Soldier of

     Fortune and a Punisher comic book.

     The rifle is not here.

     INT. BANK

                             RATH

               Listen to me, Bain.  Two days ago,

               you contacted your contractor, who

               told you that they knew when and

               where I was going to pick up the

               transferred money from MicroCell.

               You don't know how they got the

               information.  It bothered you, but

               you didn't care.  How do I know

               this?  Because ten years ago, I was

               sitting in that chair, as scared

               shitless as you are now.

                             BAIN

               I ain't scared of you.

                             RATH

               Yeah you are and you hate it.  You

               hate the fact that your hand is

               shaking and mine isn't.  That you're

               sweating your balls off and I'm not.

               You've got fear and hate in your

               belly like battery acid, all because

               of me.

                             BAIN

               If you think you can take me, quit

               fucking bullshitting and try it.

                             RATH

               All right, Bain.  Pay attention,

               because this is where everything

               changes.

     INT. BURNED HOTEL

     Electra is beginning to panic.  She cannot find the gun

     and has started looking in other rooms.

     INT. BANK

                             RATH

               You're a businessman, right?  This

               is a business deal.  Behind that

               counter, I have over ten million

               dollars.  I'll give you half of it,

               more money than you'll make in the

               next ten years if, you walk away.

     Bain's face changes, muscles relaxing, the tension

     slipping out of him.

                             BAIN

               Five million dollars?

                             RATH

               That's right.

                             BAIN

               Shit.  That sure is a lot of money.

     Bain is smiling.

                             RATH

               Did you see how I did that?  Magic

               wasn't it?

                             BAIN

               What?

                             RATH

               You understand what's going on?  It

               makes sense, right?

                             BAIN

               Oh, yeah.

                             RATH

               What I just said, no assassin would

               say.  What I've said, only a mark

               would say.

     They stare at each other.

                             BAIN

               You think I would be an idiot to

               pass up five million dollars.

                             RATH

               You would be.

                             BAIN

               You don't know a fucking thing about

               me.  You don't have the slightest

               fucking clue.

                             RATH

               Why don't you tell me.

                             BAIN

               I'll tell you this.  After

               Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to

               be alive.  But now, here, I just

               realized that you were the lucky

               one.

                             RATH

               Now I'll tell you something.  It

               wouldn't fucking matter if I offered

               you one hundred million dollars.

               You'd still be thinking the same

               thing, that you're going to take me.

               And here I am, sitting through this,

               knowing it's bullshit, looking at

               you and the only thing going on in

               my mind, the only thing I can think

               is that, in just a few minutes I'm

               going to take you.

     Bain jumps out of the seat.

                             BAIN

               Yeah, okay!  I'm ready!  Let's

               fucking go!

     He's walking, turning, watching everything, everyone.

     He's out the door.

     INT. BURNED HOTEL

     Electra is on the fourth level, searching desperately for

     the gun, rushing through the black skeletal remains of the

     hotel.

     In her ear she hears Rath.

                             RATH (V.O.)

               Electra?

     She shrieks.

     Rath is at the counter, as the Official loads perfectly

     stacked blocks of crisp one hundred dollar bills into the

               Electra?

     INT. BURNED HOTEL

     Electra is frantic.

               God, I can't find it!  I can't find

     For Rath, everything has changed.

     In long, pounding strides, Bain crosses the square,

     twisting, glancing back, watching.

     INT. BURNED HOTEL

     Electra nears the room below the fifth story window.

                             ELECTRA

               It wasn't with his other stuff!

     Rath is now afraid.

                             RATH

               Electra, get out.

     EXT. SIDE STREET

     Bain nears the opening in the plywood wall.

     INT. BURNED HOTEL

     Electra looks up and there is the gun; supported by black

     plumbing pipe and charred lathe.  It hangs in the space

     between two joists, hidden in the upstairs floor.

                             RATH (V.O.)

               He's coming, Electra!  Get out now!

                             ELECTRA

               Oh, God.  I see it!

     She reaches for it, but it's too high.

                             RATH (V.O.)

               Electra, listen!  You have got to

               come to the bank for the money!  The

               money!

     She is not listening; she is rushing down the hall, back

     toward the stairs.

     Just as she grabs the rail, she hears BAIN STORMING INTO

     THE LOBBY below.

     She begins climbing the stairs, quickly but quietly.

     Bain is a rampaging beast, lunging up the stairs.

     INT. BANK

     The bank is almost empty.  Rath has begun to sweat.

                             RATH

               Electra!

     The Official looks at him strangely, stacking the last of

     the green paper blocks.

     INT. BURNED HOTEL

     Electra peeks over the rail to see Bain right behind her.

                             RATH (V.O.)

               Electra!

     The voice screams in her ear and she tears the mike off,

     stuffing it in her pocket.

     INT. BANK

                             RATH

               Electra, what's happening?  What are

               you --

     The Official closes the case and snaps the clasps shut.

                             OFFICIAL

               Finido, senor.

     INT. BURNED HOTEL

     Electra turns into the hotel room just as Bain reaches the

     fifth floor.  There is no time.

     She slips into the closet, as Bain whips around the corner

     into the room.  He rushes to the window, slamming himself

     against it.

                             BAIN

               You're gonna take me?  Come on!

               Come on, motherfucker!

     He bends down and from the hole that he fell into, pulls

     out the assault rifle.

                             BAIN

               Take this!  Take this, you fuck!

     Electra watches through the slits of the blackened wood

     lathe.

     He pounds his fist rapidly into his thigh and then through

     the wall.

                             BAIN

               Motherfucker!

     He stands suddenly, perfectly still, gun aimed at the

     bank.

                             BAIN

               Comeon-comeon-comeone-it'sover-

               gameover-comeon.

     INT. BANK

     The sun clock reads six o'clock.

     There is no one left in the bank except for employees and

     guards.

     The Official is at Rath's elbow leading him towards the

     metal gates.

                             OFFICIAL

               We are closed, senor.  Thank you for

               banking with us.

     It is happening as it happened ten years ago.  Rath knows

     that he is unable to stop it.

     INT. BURNED HOTEL

     Bain is rigid, cast in iron, the rifle rammed under his

     chin, sight tight to his eye, finger wrapped around the

     trigger.

     Electra silently, ever so delicately opens her bag,

     lifting out her gun.

                             BAIN

               Make me shit, you sorry ass piece of

               mark meat!  Come on, come on.  It's

               over!  I know it!  You know it!  We

               know it!

     In the...

     TELESCOPIC SIGHT

     we watch Rath step out of the bank, the doors closing

     behind him.

     BACK TO SCENE

     Bain smiles.

     INSIDE CLOSET

     Electra slowly rises, still watching Bain.

     EXT. PLAZA

     The sun has begun to set and the entire plaza has a deep

     orange and auburn cast.

     Rath looks down at the descending, white, stone steps.

     He steps down to the first stair.

     INT. BURNED HOTEL

                             BAIN

               Lift your head, motherfucker.

     Electra is standing.  The gun clenched in her shaking

     hand.

                             BAIN

               Look up here.

     TELESCOPIC SIGHT

     The cross-hairs are an "X" on Rath's head.

     BACK TO SCENE

                             BAIN

               Look up.  Look at me.  I want to see

               your face.

     EXT. PLAZA

     Rath looks across the square, up the side of the hotel, at

     the window; there is only black shadow.

     He knows it is over.

     INT. BURNED HOTEL

                             BAIN

               Yes.

     Electra shoves open the door, leveling the gun --

     As Bain turns.

                             BAIN

               Wha --

     She FIRES.

     His shoulder explodes, blood spraying the black wall.

     EXT. PLAZA

     Rath hears BAIN SCREAM.

                             RATH

               Electra.

     His eyes, his whole body comes to life.

     INT. BURNED HOTEL

     Bain is twisting in mid-air, diving as --

     She FIRES again, moving at him.  A chunk of WOOD EXPLODES

     as she misses.

     He falls, the burned FLOOR SHATTERING, charred JOISTS

     SHEARING with the sound of BREAKING GLASS.

     She watches him fall through, hears him HIT the FLOOR

     below, ASH and WOOD CLATTERING around him.

     The gun trained on the hole, she peers over the edge, but

     he is gone.

     EXT. PLAZA

     Rath races wildly across the darkening market square.

     INT. BURNED HOTEL

     Bain, lying on his back, aims the rifle at her FOOTSTEPS.

                             BAIN

               Die, bitch!

     He FIRES, finger pumping, BULLETS ERUPTING through the

     floor around her feet.

     Screaming, she leaps out of the room, into the hall.

     His shoulders oozing blood, Bain clenches his teeth and

     rises, listening as --

     She sprints for the stairs at the far end of the hall.

     Beneath, he moves to the railing and aims at the

     staircase, waiting, until --

     Electra freezes at the top of the stairs, realizing that

     they are exposed.

     She flashes her head, quickly dipping back as the WALL is

     PERFORATED with BULLETS.

                             BAIN

               Fuck!  God damn bitch!  What are you

               doing?  I don't believe this is

               happening!

     She can hear him coming, his voice ECHOING through the

     hollow building.  She looks down the stairs, the hall,

     above; there is nowhere to go.

                             BAIN

               You're dead!  You're fucking dead!

               I'm going to kill you a hundred

               fucking times for this!

     Bain FIRES up at the ceiling, the BULLET tearing through

     the floor, WHIZZING past Electra's head.  If she moves

     he'll know her position.

     He FIRES another.

     Electra sinks down, her back against the wall and aims at

     the floor.

     Another SHOT.

     She FIRES back.

     Bain closes, as they both start FIRING, silenced WEAPONS,

     flashing, PUMPING LEAD at unseen targets.

     Her gun empties first.

     He laughs hearing the CLICK.

                             BAIN

               Game over, bitch!

                             RATH

               Bain!

     Rath's scream ECHOES up through the building.

     Before Bain can target him, Rath is gone; a shadow, a

     ghost.  He scans the hotel's courtyard.  The last light

     from the setting sun slips through the slits, cracks and

     broken window panes, casting patterns; a surreal dream-

     like grid resembling a chess board.

     Electra sees her chance.  She leaps to her feet, throwing

     the gun over the balcony.

     The two men watch the GUN CLATTER to the floor as she

     races back to the room.

                             BAIN

               Fuck no!

     Rath grabs the gun tracking Bain hurling up the stairs to

     the fifth floor.  Rath pulls the trigger and finds the gun

     is empty.

                             RATH

               Shit!

     Bain reaches the top of the stairs before Electra gets to

     the end of the hall.

     Rath sees it all happening.

                             RATH

               Electra!

     Bain snaps into a targeting stance.

     Electra is flying toward the door, her feet hardly

     touching the floor --

     TELESCOPIC SIGHT

     When the cross-hairs find her back.

     BACK TO SCENE

                             RATH

               Electra!

     Time becomes syrup.

                             RATH

               Down!  Get down!

     Bain FIRES.

     Electra dives.

     The blackened DOOR JAMB SPLINTER-BURSTS in front of her.

     She bounces, scrambling on all fours into the room.

     Bain hurries down the hall after her as Rath bolts for the

     stairs.

     Seeing Rath exposed on the stairs, Bain whips around and

     FIRES, the WALL SHREDDING behind Rath as he dives back

     down into the shadows.

     Ripping open Bain's duffel bag Electra grabs Bain's .22.

     Bain advances steadily, the rifle trained on the door.

     Inside the room Electra grunts, hurling the duffel bag out

     the door.  It spins over the balcony and plummets to the

     ground and bursts open.

     A GUN CLIP SKITTERS across the stone tile coming to rest

     in the middle of the courtyard.

     Rath and Bain both see it.

     Staying hidden, Rath immediately circles towards it.

     Bain sweats, looking at the door, down at the clip, then

     back at the door.  Something's got to give.

     Unsure what to do Electra waits, the gun clenched between

     her two hands, covering the empty, dark space of the door.

     Bain makes his choice, moving towards room 502.

     Rath sees that Bain is going after Electra.  He takes a

     slow breath and tears from the shadows --

     Bolting into the open, Rath is focused wholly on the clip,

     the ground a blur beneath him --

     Bain reacts; the rifle swings, rushing, arcing after Rath.

     Two more steps and Rath dives, sliding, snagging the clip

     as --

     The RIFLE SPITS --

     Rath screams, his leg erupting with blood.

     TELESCOPIC SIGHT

     The scope glides up zeroing the back of Rath's head.

     BACK TO SCENE

     Rath rams the clip in place.

                             BAIN

               Game --

     Bain squeezes the trigger --

     CLICK -- the rifle is empty.  Bain screams in disbelief.

     Rolling over, Rath jacks back the slide and sights the

     balcony but Bain is gone.

     Electra searches the room for a way out.  Keeping the gun

     trained on the door she steps carefully over to the hole

     that Bain fell through.

     Grimacing, Rath struggles to his feet.

                             RATH

               Electra!

     Bain explodes through the wall, charred wood and plaster

     flying.

     Electra spins to shoot but the FLOOR suddenly CRACKS OPEN,

     swallowing her.

     Limping, lurching up the stairs, Rath hears the CRASH.

     Jarred by the fall, Electra drags herself away from the

     open ceiling.

                             RATH

               The gun!  He needs the gun!  Get rid

               of it!  Throw it!

     She looks up for Bain but he has again disappeared.  She

     looks at the gun, thinking, turning it over in her hands.

     His leg soaked with blood, Rath rumbles down the hall.

     Black with soot, Bain descends soundless, serpent-like to

     the fourth level through another burned opening.

     Electra moves towards the door aiming at every sound, at

     every dark corner.  She is almost there when we see Bain,

     a shadow coming to life, emerging behind her.

     Lumbering, Rath is halfway there, his eyes riveted on the

     door to room 502.

     Hearing Bain, Electra turns.  In one smooth motion, he

     snatches her arm and breaks her wrist.  The gun falls.

     Rath hears her scream.

     Electra kicks at his groin but he drops, leg sweeping her

     to the ground.

     She gropes for the gun when he kicks her in the face,

     jack-knifing her body back, knocking her unconscious.

     Bain grabs the gun.

     Rath whips into the room BLASTING --

     BULLETS CHASING Bain as he disappears into a blackened

     hole.

     Rath goes to Electra not knowing if she is alive or dead.

     Gently he turns her, cradling her head, her face, smeared

     with blood.

     From within the labyrinth, Rath hears BAIN begin to LAUGH.

                             BAIN (O.S.)

               Hey!  Tell me something, Bobby-boy.

     Electra comes to, her eyes blinking open.

                             BAIN (O.S.)

               Are you still thinking that you're

               going to take me?

     Electra is trying to focus, as Rath listens to the voice,

     searching the shadows but the voice seems to come from

     everywhere.

                             BAIN (O.S.)

               No, I don't think you are.  You know

               what I think?

     The voice is closer.  Rath wipes the stinging sweat from

     his eyes.

                             BAIN (O.S.)

               I think you're thinking what I'm

               thinking.

     Still dizzy, Electra taps her fist against Rath's chest.

                             BAIN (O.S.)

               You know what I'm thinking,

               Bobby-boy?!

     It seems as though Bain is in the room.

                             BAIN (O.S.)

               You know what I'm thinking?!

     Electra opens her fist and inside Rath sees the handful of

     bullets from the other gun.

     Bain whirls INTO VIEW, his gun whipping around to Rath who

     turns too slow.

     Bain pumps the trigger.  ONE CLICK.  ANOTHER.  And

     ANOTHER.  The gun is empty.

                             RATH

               Yeah, I know what you're thinking.

     He levels his gun.

                             RATH

               Game over.

     Rath FIRES, OVER and OVER, emptying the GUN into Bain's

     head and chest, even as he crashes through the balcony

     railing and falls, twisting through lightless space,

     slamming to the stone floor dead.

     EXT. PLAZA DEL SOL - NIGHT

     The sun is gone, the market is closing, the crowd drifting

     from the plaza.

     A man and a woman emerge from the shadows of the alley

     beside the boarded hotel.  Although they walk a bit slow,

     leaning on one another, they become it seems, like just

     another couple, arm in arm, holding tightly to each other

     and to a very large suitcase.

                                                 FADE OUT.

                              THE END
