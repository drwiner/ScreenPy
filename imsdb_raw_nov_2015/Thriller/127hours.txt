          EXT. CROWD SCENES. VARIOUS.

          A massive crowd, it could be a sports stadium, a u2 farewell

          show or new year's eve on copacabana beach, but whatever it

          is there are thousands and thousands of us. A mexican wave

          erupts success, celebration, with so many involved it's

          impossible to pick out anyone individually. Critical mass

          cyclists, easter crowds at st. Peter's basilica, nyc

          marathon, 4,000 flash mobbers doing the silent disco at

          london's victoria station, india's kumbh mela, macy's

          thanksgiving day parade, raves, subway parties, the daytona

          500. . . . Gradually the screen splits into 2, and then 3,

          though at times there appears to be no division at all.

          OPENING TITLES ARE A SERIES OF TRIPTYCHS FEATURING ALL THE

          INTERCUT WITH ADVERTS SOME FROM THE BILLBOARDS ARON'S VAN

          OF COURSE, ALL THESE INTERCUT WITH ARON AND HIS TRUCK. AND

          THE LANDSCAPE.

          A TITLE CARD READS:

          'Utah. The Canyonlands. The slickrock desert. The red dust

          INT. ARON'S TRUCK. NIGHT.

          At the southwest edge of Green River, Aron Ralston drives

          under the interstate into a landscape of obscurity. He looks

          to his right and left, not a single light perforates the

          absolute blackness of the San Rafael Desert.

          Slowly, images from the Great Gallery materialise on

          different parts of the Triptych - petroglyphs and

          pictographs; dozens of 8-10 ft high Superhumans hovering over

          groups of indistinct animals, dominating beasts and onlookers

          alike with their long, dark bodies, broad shoulders, and

          haunting eyes.

          Rushing across the desert grooves, pulling, snatching, hard

          left and right, the rear of the truck fishtails madly.

          Curves, swoops and sandy washes kick up dust clouds as

          everything in the truck flies all over the place. Except his

          bike, locked down and braced solid.

          Suddenly a small brown sign flashes past. He kicks down on

          road spur to Horseshoe and Blue John Canyons.

          He turns off the music and waits for a head to pop out or a

          light to come on but they have all turned in. Ghostly.

          He glides to a flat spot near the sign board welcoming

          visitors to the Horseshoe Canyon quadrant of Canyonlands

          National Park.

          He whips into the back of the truck and flings everything out

          It's still like a wild road movie, but now on a bicycle.

          Having parked his motorized transport he ploughs into the

          land like an ad for extreme sports. Past bikers, he vanishes

          temporarily in their dust cloud, he wears a bandana across

          his face as the bikers pass by... a final telephone box, past

          remnants of those who tried to settle or work this

          unforgiving land; Aborigines, frontier settlers, ranchers...

          all driven away from a heartland he ploughs into.......

          Wearing a pair of beat-up running shoes and thick wool-blend

          socks, Lycra biking shorts and a Phish tee shirt he has a

          back pack with equipment but hydrates through a gallon of

          water stored in an insulated three litre CamelBak hydration

          pouch which he sucks on without stopping.

          His bike pummels the canyon landscape and you get a sense of

          the exhilaration this man gets from pitting himself alone

          against what nature can offer. He's clearly a fit and daring

          young man and these are his kicks.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. DESERT. DAY.

          Even uphill he hammers his way up the sandstone. Gasping for

          oxygen, his legs screaming for rest, he pushes and pushes

          until the crest and then down, down, instant speed and he can

          suck on his water again. Part of a massive clan who define

          themselves not by what they are, but by what they do. In a

          way, he's an action movie personified and the opening should

          be shot and cut to provide adrenaline in spadefuls.

          Until...

          Suddenly, he hits a sand trap and hurtles forward over the

          handle bars, face first into the sand, his toe clips and

          momentum brings the bike with him. The bike has him trapped

          on the desert floor like a takedown in wrestling. He submits,

          landing nose deep in the sand. He sits up, looks around

          quickly to see if anyone saw. Pulls out his camera from his

          bag and takes a a self-portrait snap of the mess.

          At what seems like the only tree for miles he U-locks his

          heads off into the desert.

          He approaches the crest of a sand gulley and sees below him,

          just 30 yards down the canyon, 2 fellow hikers. He looks

          around. All of them in the middle of nowhere it seems.

          He can see now it's 2 girls passing a map back and forth

          between them. He rushes towards them, initially above them as

          he walks along side. They're aware of him before he arrives:

                          ARON

           Hey. Are you doing the east pike?

           Can I come along with you for a

           while?

          The girls don't reply, just look at each other.

                          ARON (CONT'D)

           I'm on my own. I'm Aron.

          He slides/surfs down so he's on the same level as them,

          arriving in a haze of dust, holding out his hand for the

          shake. Big smile.

           I left mine at the Horseshoe Canyon

           and biked here.

           I do this a lot.

          They laugh. He's crazy, but harmless.

                          ARON (CONT'D)

           Wasn't expecting to see anyone in

           the canyon today.

                          MEGAN

           Yeah, you surprised us, sneaking up

           like that.

           Sorry.

                          MEGAN

           It's kind of nervy seeing a lone

           guy walking up to you in the middle

           of the desert.

                          ARON

           Yeah, I know, I mean there's no one

           around for 50 miles.

                          KRISTI

           ... and suddenly there's a guy

           right behind you and `wait a

           minute, why is he wearing a HOCKEY

           MASK!'

          They all laugh.

                          ARON

           Let me guess... You're here for

           the paintings or the Cathedral?

           The climb's a little tricky but

           it's worth it.

          Towards us comes Aron, upside down, like a tiny, fast spider,

          talking all the time, his voice echoing.

                          ARON

           There's thousands of holds but you

           can't see them until you're almost

           upside down and then they just keep

           appearing... it's a bit of a act of

           faith so I'll go first... take off

           as much as you dare as there's a

           bit of a surprise at the other

           I swear I won't look but I swear

           you won't care when you get out

           here...

          We've been moving towards him as he rushes towards us, spider

          style. He's stripped to his underwear. He's lithe to say

          the least. We can't see the girls or what's underneath us

          but there's a feeling of the vertiginous, as much from the

          weird echo and the sense of reflected light as from the scale

          of the dome.

                          ARON (CONT'D)

           ... and the thing is, when you get

           to the middle...

          He lets go.

                          ARON (CONT'D)

           ... there aren't any more.

          We spin and watch him fall into the most exquisite emerald

          pool 60 feet below.

           Of course he's ok. Listen to him.

          Aron fills the cathedral dome with his version of a Phish

          song at the top of his voice. Kristi strips to her underwear

          and traverses away from Megan.

          heading out arachnid-style to the centre. Before she gets

          there Megan appears too. She's left everything on except her

          shoes.

          They crash into the pool one after the other. They bob

          together in the centre, the light seems to come from beneath

          them and ripple over the heavenly ceiling.

           ascents.

                          MEGAN

           Wow, highest person in Colorado.

                          ARON

           Well I figure no one else is mad

           enough to climb in the winter.

                          KRISTI

           ... you can be the highest person

           on the continent!

           Didn't you see it?

           What? No.

                          MEGAN

           Yeah, it's an old cattle guardian's

           house - the roof's caved in and

           someone spray-painted MOTEL 6 on

           the side. Smelled weird though.

                          ARON

           Just like a MOTEL 6 then?

           Why are you on your own?

           Solitude. Great tunes. Empty

           mind.

          He indicates the wilderness.

                          ARON (CONT'D)

           And I can sing Phish songs as loud

           as I like.

                          MEGAN

           Phish?

           Not those guys from...

                          ARON

           Yeah, I know, I know.

                          (LAUGHS)

           See, that's why I'm on my own.

           Nobody likes me or my band.

          They laugh as he goofs for them. He gathers all their

          packaging and stuffs it in his backpack.

                          ARON (CONT'D)

          Megan at the top, Kristi on her way down to him.

           It's hard to get the hours to

           qualify. Catch 22.

                          KRISTI

           Well, we'll sign your time-card

           today.

                          ARON

           Great. Now put your ass on my head.

                          KRISTI

           Okay but don't look and no grabbing

           now, if I do...

                          MEGAN

           Oh whatever, you love it.

                          KRISTI

           Shhh!

          Aron then quickly slips to the bottom. Megan is way high,

          Kristi half way.

                          ARON

           (at his most instructor-

           ish, talking all the time

           as he makes his way down)

           You'll have to chimney down a

           little ways - like here, watch -

           one foot on each wall then squat

           onto your right heel, now your

           butt's on the wall, so you can move

           your right foot across, now put

           your left foot under your butt

           lower down and scootch your butt

           down - watch that black part, it's

           slick, slime, try not to get it on

           your shoes - if you can get to

           these bomber handholds here it's

           like an elevator shaft and just

           think friction to control the

           slide. This is a keeper so always

           have someone at the bottom to boost

           you out.

          He looks up to them.

          their map round and round.

           13.

                          MEGAN (CONT'D)

           Kristi, I think this is our way

           back.

                          ARON

           Why don't you come with me to the

           Big Drop Rappel? I can give you a

           lift back to your car.

                          KRISTI

           How far is it?

          He shows them on the map.

                          ARON

           About another 8 miles or so, I

           think.

                          MEGAN

           You'll never get out before dark.

                          ARON

           No, I really got to do this. Anyway

           I've my miner's lamp.

           You don't climb at night, do you?

                          ARON

           No, it's great for seeing snakes in

           hand holds. Can I get a picture

           then?

          They pose with raven feathers in their hair.

                          ARON (CONT'D)

           Listen, my friends are having a

           party tomorrow night. You should

           come.

                          KRISTI

           Yeah, we'd like that. What time?

                          MEGAN

           Where?

                          ARON

           Drive on the east road and about 40

           miles out there's a huge inflatable

           Scooby Doo. You can't miss it.

           Turn off and it's about 2 miles

           down that track. Starts late and

           it'll go right thru.

          Lots of cheek kissing and his last picture of them...

           14.

                          KRISTI

           Come on Aron, hike out with us -

           we'll go get your truck, hang out

           and have a beer.

                          ARON

           No, I really got to do this.

           Okay. Scooby Doo, yeah?

                          ARON

           That's the one. I'll have 3 cold

          flash of the sky and dazzling sunlight.

          He keeps moving, descending still, but a little more

          circumspect. He lets the change of pace allow him to whip

          round his pack and with the practice of thousands of times

          selects and plays a CD without stopping, slipping the

          his head and ours.

          He's heard it many times as he alternatively

          S-shaped log, sand bleached and wind dried it looks like a

          massive reptile making its way down the canyon. Beyond it,

          massive tree logs jammed at strange angles high above him and

          silhouetted against the blue cloudless sky, he drinks deeply

          as we track above him - it's like the canyon in Star Wars and

          he's Anakin feeling the force. One set of chockstones leads

          to another and he rapidly negotiates them like an obstacle

          race - until there's one the size of a big refrigerator which

          underneath, rucking the sandy floor in front of him. He's

          halfway, his chest rising out the far side when suddenly he

          can't move. The music jams and loops on 2 notes like bad

          techno. He pushes but nothing.

          He reaches back with his hand and releases a part of his

          rucksack strap that's snagged. And the music releases too.

          of him chimneying his way along the canyon now only 3 ft wide

          at most. It's a chance to see his skill and thirst for

          climbing. And to see how deep he's going.

          He uses his legs, back and natural body weight to body walk

          He's moving towards a final chockstone below him jammed in

          the gap. You can see the way he's thinking: it's about the

          size of a bus wheel and used as a platform will help him

          reduce the 10 foot drop and get quickly down into the next

          too close and the stone judders towards him, pulled by the

          torque of his weight on his side, rotating.

          Instantly and instinctively he lets go and drops. Like he's

          trying to detach a mine dragging him to the sea floor.

          His arms rise to protect his head but his eyes remain open

          and through his fingers we see the next 3 seconds. The rock's

          face and his.

          It grabs his left hand and flings it against the left wall.

          He pulls it away as the rock ricochets against the canyon and

          careers towards his right arm which he raises, to compensate

          for withdrawing the left, and to protect his head.

          The rock smashes the right hand and wrist against the wall

          and drags it down the remaining distance. Like a cheese

          grater it tears the skin from the back of the hand and the

          forearm, decorating the wall. Aron is powerless to stop its

          force and he lands on his feet allowing the rock to jam in

          front of him with his hand held against the canyon wall by

          the stone.

          All this happens too quickly. We can hardly register what's

           SHIT, SHIT, SHIT, SHIT...

          Pushing with his left hand desperate to reverse the action;

          so simple to undo the moment, to reverse gravity for a split

          second and pull his hand out... nothing. Again and again

          thrusting up with knees, thighs, pelvis, left arm, head,

           YEEARKGG... UNNNHHH

          Air exploding out of his lungs. And then a quiet hollow

           NO, NO, NO, NO, FUCK.

          He reverses the fraction and collapses in sweat and blood,

          knees bleeding, good fingers lacerated. But he remains

          upright, attached. Unable to physically collapse.

          Grabs his shirt and wipes sweat away and goes to drink. He

          hula-hoops out of his backpack to get access to the water,

          gulps down 3 full throatfulls - stops mid 4th and backwashes

          stretching and contorting to see into his crushed and

          wretched hand where his thumb is visible above and his little

          finger below. No matter how much he touches them, there is

          no feeling. He prods up and down to see what feeling is left

          and where it stops. Comparing left hand to where the right

          hand is trapped to measure the width of his right wrist - now

          smaller than the width of his little finger on his right

          hand. He can barely get the little finger of his left hand in

          balances it against the wall or with his mouth. Weird close

          angles as he almost taps the side of his eye socket.

          Suddenly, he hammers down with ten times more force onto the

          handle of the knife, the rock explodes in his hand, showering

          pick dust over everything, and bouncing the knife off the

          rock. Once again, gravity takes over. The knife hits his

          shorts and as he moves to grab it, he misses it and knocks it

          further round the back of his leg. He pivots and turns to try

          and catch it but gravity is quicker than his restricted twist

          from the multi tool and has tied a shoe lace to his wrist and

          looped through the ring at the end of the tool. He pulls his

          multiple lights in the distance but it's unclear what it

          stunningly beautiful red-haired woman in her mid-20s,

          effortlessly organising the 15 or so group. As before, we

          it's going to miss him. He whips off his left shoe and sock

          and pushes it towards the coming light. Slowly it climbs and

          caresses his ankle and lower calf. He pulls the other sock

          off and alternates the feet. He looks like he's doing yoga.

          As it leaves him passing overhead it suddenly bursts into the

                          ARON

           It's three-oh-five on Sunday. This

           marks my twenty-four-hour mark of

           being stuck in Blue John Canyon

           above the Big Drop. My name is

           Aron Ralston. My parents are Donna

           and Larry Ralston of Englewood,

           Colorado. Whoever finds this,

           please make an attempt to get this

           to them. Be sure of it. I would

           appreciate it.

          He takes long blinks and seems to avoid looking at himself

          though the screen is facing him. He looks alarmed and wide

          eyed, startled, in contrast to his slow slurred delivery.

                          ARON (CONT'D)

           So... I was hiking Blue John Canyon

           yesterday... and this happened.

          He pulls the camera round to show where his forearm and wrist

          disappear into the horrifyingly skinny gap between the

          chockstone and the wall. As he does that we

          Flashes of the accident-almost in silhouette - like an

          animatic side view. It freezes just before the moment of

          entombment.

           What you're looking at there is my

           arm, going into the rock... and

           there it is, stuck. It's been

           without circulation for 24 hours.

                          ARON (CONT'D)

           It's pretty well gone. If the

           colour doesn't come across on the

           video, it's grey and blue.

                          ARON (CONT'D)

           Unnhhhhh.......I'm in deep stuff.

                          ARON (CONT'D)

           So I have very little water.

          He can't help look in the camera towards those who know what

          that means in this place.

                          ARON (CONT'D)

           Yeah, I have about a third of a

           litre left.

          He picks up the water bottle and shakes it for the camera.

           So the way I see it... there's kind

           of four things happening here... I

           tried to move it with some

           rigging... useless... and I tried

           chipping away at the rock... I

           think part of the problem is, is

           that my hand is actually supporting

           the rock. Which means every time I

           chip away the rock moves a bit and

           settles onto my hand again. I

           can't feel it happening but

           microscopically, it seems to be,

           because the little gap over there

           between the rock and the wall seems

           to be getting smaller. And this

           chockstone is the hardest thing

           here.

                          ARON

           So the third thing left was to cut

           my arm off.

                         PAUSE

                          ARON (CONT'D)

           I don't know whether I could do

           that but it's pretty much suicide.

           It's four hours to my vehicle that

           way and with very difficult

           climbing with one hand and the bike

           is like two, two and a half hours,

           that way but the climbing... fourth

           class climbing... which I think

           will be probably impossible with

           one hand... between the blood loss

           and the dehydration I think I would

           die if I cut off my arm.

                          ARON (CONT'D)

           Which means I'm waiting for someone

           to come along.

          He summons up the guts to let the evidence out.

                          ARON (CONT'D)

           I didn't tell anyone where I was

           going and I didn't leave a note on

           the truck.

                          ARON (CONT'D)

           Dumb.

          The video whirrs on until he suddenly looks straight into the

          lens.

          Freaky. We just see an arbitrary view of the rock and sky on

          desperation, screaming at no one, distorting on the tiny

          it up with his teeth.

          Purple webbing around his right arm, the insulated Camelbak

           God, I am praying to you for

           to do. I've tried everything I can

           Please show me a sign.

          PAUSE - Just his breath.

          He switches on the head lamp and the inside of the bag

          explodes with light. There's enough light for any kind of

          heaven but it's just Aron in Blue John Canyon. He looks

          around his bag. He stops. Silence. Only his breathing to

          He looks at his puffy left hand... there's a tremble in it.

          He shakes it to get rid of the tremble and jams the bottle

          He watches them devour him and then he clears them away from

          his hand. Suddenly breaks and he's busy now well before

          sunrise. In the grey-white, soft morning he is involved in

          recycling his overnight insulation gear into a crude lift and

          pulley.

          Obsessive, inventive, analytical, he constantly adjusts and

          adds and subtracts, and cannibalizes. Undoing and tieing

          knots with his teeth and hand. Each time nothing happens to

          the rock. But each time he doesn't stop. He tries again and

          again and again; looping and re-looping throwing and catching

          ropes; creating footholds and bouncing in them with his foot,

          his knees, his ass.

          Finally he stops. He looks down. For a moment it's as though

          he will cry. He looks up to where he came from and

          Through the slot canyon, up and into the blazing light across

          the desert paths, past his chained-up bicycle and back to his

          We crash into the back of the truck and there, lying on its

          grapefruit, and another one, and they've got sparkly

          condensation on them -like advertising spritzer mist - all

          over them. And a water bottle, and an orange. And high

          energy snack bars and another orange. The fruit seems to

          roll around the empty truck.

          The Gatorade lies on its side and the liquid slaps slowly

          backward and forward like a Lava lamp. The liquid literally

           'It's not what you do but who you

           I kind of got hung up on that a

           lot, because I always thought who I

           was, was very much wrapped up with

           what I did. That I was happy

           because of the things that I did

           that made me happy. If things you

          The two bottles stand looking at him. He goes back in the

          Megan and Kristi. The Cathedral. They clamber out in wet

          clothes - it's from after their first jumps. We see all

          three of them climb and fall and get out of the water and

          climb and fall, smashing into the azure water. Their faces

          are dripping wet, beaming mad, screaming and howling,

          completely natural, children really, on their first helter-

          skelter / Big Dipper.

          He rewinds this time in vision. Kristi's bra and pants are

          soaking. Megan's top cascades water as she rises out of the

          water.

          It's now lit up too, as night is falling, and we're coming at

          Jump cut, inside it's nice, full of ordinary decent people,

          though no one acknowledges Aron as we stay attached to his

          shoulder. There's a mini-Scooby Doo dancing in the main room

          and there's a light, early party atmosphere. Aron searches

          for the girls, approaching any cluster to see which girls

          they contain. Rana is there but doesn't acknowledge him.

           51.

          There's no Megan or Kristi anywhere and we finally settle on

          the bar / drinks table where there is an ocean of all kinds

          of drink. And melting ice in huge buckets with bottles of

          beer floating around in them. And orange juice, and

          popsicles. And melon, and lemon and lime. And grapefruit

          and oranges for Margaritas are filling frosted glasses.

          Aron ducks out of his head-bag and shakes his water bottle.

          Something he always does - to check the sound of real water.

          To make sure he hasn't drunk it all without knowing. He

          opens, tilts and holds as always and then ritualistically

          removes his contact lenses and washes them in his mouth.

          Suddenly a shiver tears across him like an attack dog. He

          coughs a lens out and as he tries to catch it before it goes

          into the sand he tips the bottle in his lap.

          He hasn't put the top on fully. It goes horizontal on his

          shorts and a leak of the sacred fluid darkens his tan shorts.

          He whips it upright.

                          ARON

           (furious at himself)

           Fuck a nut, Aron. Pay fucking

           attention - look what you did?

          He stares at the stain - with all the dirt on his shorts it's

          already paste. He screws the lid on slowly and can barely be

          bothered to lift his lens into his mouth.

          and he's clearly in the deep background of a vehicle. In

          front of him a half a dozen of his friends (boys and

          girls)... and Rana, excitedly chatting. Though we can hear

          nothing.

          Gradually it becomes clear it's night outside. They are all

          undressing in their seats until all are butt naked. The tone

          (we can't hear) is clearly more infantile than sexual. We're

          beginning to see there's a ferocious blizzard outside. And

          we appear to be badly exposed to it. Up a mountain, on the

          crest of a high road... Snow, hail, swirls savagely around

          all sides of the truck. We remain inside. It's warm, the

          heater blows.

          They prepare themselves for a mutual signal, press their

          window buttons. All the windows open and a BLIZZARD explodes

                          ARON

           Good morning everyone! It's 6:45

           Tuesday morning in BJ Canyon. The

           weather is great! I figure by now

           that Leona, my housemate - Hi

           Leona! - has missed me hopefully

           since I didn't show up last night.

           Another hour and a half they'll

           miss me for not showing up for

           work. Hi Brion at work! Best case

           scenario is they notify the police

           and after a 24 hour hold they file

           a report, a missing persons report.

           Which means noon tomorrow it's

           official that I'm gone. I do still

           have the tiniest bit of water left.

           Well, actually, I've resorted...I've

           had a couple pretty good gulps of

           urine that I saved in my Camelbak.

           I sorta let it distill...it tastes

           like hell. So it's 70 hours since

           I left on my bike from Horseshoe

           Trailhead during which time I have

           consumed 3 liters of water and a

           couple mouthfuls of piss.

          Pause.

           Did I say the weather is great?

           Well, it is. Though flash floods

           potential is still present. There's

           4-prong major canyons upstream from

           me that all converge in this 3 foot

           wide gap where I am. The rock I

           pulled down on top of me, it was

           put there by flood.

           Still, I'd get a drink.

          He shudders, it's ridiculous.

          Then composes himself during a long blink and looks straight

          at the camera.

           Mom, Dad, I really love you guys.

           I wanted to take this time to say

           the times we've spent together have

           been awesome. I haven't appreciated

           you in my own heart the way I know

           I could. Mom, I love you. I wish

           I'd returned all of your calls,

           ever.

           I wish I had learned some lessons

           more astutely, more rapidly, than I

           did. I love you. I'll always be

          Switches off the camera.

          He charges into setting up the 6:1 haul system again. Much

          possessions and puts his sunglasses on.

           Ready for lift-off.

          He bounces his full weight in the stirrups and pulls on the

          haul line. It looks a better set up.

           Come on, move, dammit.

          Nothing. He stops. And stares directly at the knife below

          him. Absolute stillness. Nothing moves. Not him. Not even

          the insects.

          He folds open the knife, grasps it in his fist and picking a

          spot just above the rock's grip on his right wrist, he

          hesitates and then violently plunges the blade into his arm

          up to the hilt.

          He lets go leaving the knife embedded. He swoons and stares

          at it. He slowly grasps the tool more firmly and wriggles it

          slightly, the blade connects with something hard. He taps the

          knife down and feels it knocking on the radius of his upper

          forearm bone.

          He puts his ear close and we can hear the little thocking

          sound.

                          ARON

           Whoa, that's the bone.

          He pulls the knife out opening the wound more. There's barely

          any blood. He pokes at the gash with the tool.

                          ARON (CONT'D)

           Ouch!

          He can see the epidermis, thick and leathery rough. Yellow

          fatty tissue under the skin in a membrane layer around the

          muscle. He thocks, thocks again and some blood finally seeps

          out and blocks his view. He pulls the knife out and thinks.

          He's sweating and puts the tool on top of the chockstone.

          He immediately pulls up his water bottle and stares into it.

          With a little shake he opens it and drinks it all gulping

          open throated. He shakes any last drop down and runs his

          tongue up into the neck. He screws the lid back on and

          loosens the tourniquet. There's no discernible increase in

          blood loss.

           I made an attempt - a short career

           in surgery, as it turned out -

           those knives are just not anywhere

           close to the task. I've got about

           an inch-wide gash in my arm that

           goes about a half inch deep. I cut

           down through the skin and the fatty

           tissue, and through some of the

           muscle. I think I cut a tendon, but

           I'm not sure.

           I'll never saw through the bones

           with this knife. I tried, anyways.

           It really just didn't go well. The

           tourniquet is relaxed at this

           point. Which actually is a little

           bothersome, considering I'm not

           bleeding that bad, barely at all.

           It's so weird. You'd expect to

           definitely see more pulsing and

           bleeding, but oh well.

          teeth there's a rush of someone else's noise: the swat of

          wings. He grabs the camera just in time to catch the very end

          When it's off we establish a night vision, of green, of blue,

          that allows us to witness him in hiding. The images,

          Aron Oct 75 => APR 03 RIP.

          As we reverse back on Aron in the canyon there's a burst of

          light and color beyond him and on the sofa in the canyon a

          little boy sits. He's blond, about 3 and in a red polo shirt.

          He looks like Aron.

          Aron walks towards him, the sunlight hits his face like a

          train and Aron looks up to it but keeps moving towards the

          boy, walking downhill towards the sofa. The boy leaps off the

          sofa and comes running to Aron.

           62.

          He scoops the boy up with his left arm and balances him

          around his shoulders with his right handed stump. The boy

          holds Aron's arms in his little hands and they prance around

          the sofa, they giggle and shout playing bulls, giraffes,

          elephants, jousting knights, pretending to walk downhill

          behind the sofa. Like any father in any park. [A PERFECT POP

          in any park.

          Aron watches the image begin to fade. He switches on the

          light but its low and feeble.

          As the images on the inside of the bag fade so too does

          Aron's lamp. He tries to warm it up but it fades to black. He

          It's strangely still even by the canyon's standards. He peeks

          out from his head bag; his contacts are cloudy and sore to

          blink.

          You can hear him blink. Eye socket rasping against eyeball.

          The head lolls like he's lost control of the neck muscles.

          His tongue rasps as he flexes his mouth to prevent sealing.

           I did this Aron. I created this.

           The boulder did what it was here to

           do. It was waiting for me but it

           did the only natural thing it could

           do. I chose to come here, I chose

           to do this descent by myself. I

           chose not to tell anyone where I

           was going. I chose to turn away

           from the women who were there to

           keep me from getting in this

           trouble. I wanted it to be like

           this. Look how far I came to find

           this spot.

           It's not that I'm getting what I

           deserve - I'm getting what I

           wanted.

          He's empty now. He clicks the camera shut and puts it away.

          He looks at his 'good' hand. It's swollen and angry red like

          an inflated prosthetic on top and around of his real hand. He

          takes off his shoe and pulls the sock over his hand to

          cushion his palm and picks up the black rounded hammer rock

          again. Ignoring the pain he starts hammering at the rock

          surface. SMASH. MAD NOW.

                          ARON

           I hate this rock.

          The rage blooms purple in his mind.

                          ARON (CONT'D)

           I hate it.

          His face swells with anger, nostrils flaring.

                          ARON (CONT'D)

           I hate this fucking canyon.

          A small mushroom cloud of pulverized grit and dust erupts

          each time.

                          ARON (CONT'D)

           I hate this cold slab pressing me

           against this damp fucking wall.

          Smash, Smash, Smash.

                          ARON (CONT'D)

           I know there's water near coz of

           these fucking mosquitoes.

          The sock quickly disintegrates with friction as he hammers

          and hammers.

                          ARON (CONT'D)

           I hate this fucking mess.

          Finally he stops but his fingers are paralyzed, fused rigid

          around the rock. He pulls them off with his teeth and the

          stone drops to his feet.

          There's a thick layer of dust across the top of the stone and

          his right arm. He tries to blow it away. He fails. Tired,

          it's too thick and he's too dehydrated. He picks up his knife

          and using this starts sweeping the grit off his thumb. As he

          cleans up he accidentally rips away a thin piece of decayed

          flesh. It peels back a long way like a skin of boiled milk.

          The insects start to gather.

                          ARON (CONT'D)

           Shit.

           65.

          He pokes the thumb with the stubbed point of the blade. On

          the second prod the blade punctures the epidermis like soft

          butter. There is a clear hiss as gases escape. The stench is

          death. He looks at the gangrene attached to him, poisoning

          him.

           ARON (QUIET, CLEAR) (CONT'D)

           Get rid of it Aron, it's dead, it's

           garbage.

          He drops to his haunches but the webbing stops him at his

          waist. He detaches it and drops down again, almost able to

          squat. His trapped arm is the only thing preventing that.

          His face is suddenly open.

          He pushes and pushes with his left hand under the boulder to

          create maximum downward force on his right arm. Hard, harder,

          HARDER. It looks insane, unnatural and painful, but he says

          nothing.

                         POW

          Like a gunshot in the canyon, the bone breaks. The sound

          ricochets. He rises and sees the bone pushing up violently

          against the skin. He feels it. It's a serrated, but clean,

          successful break.

          Still he says nothing.

          Now he humps his body up and over the chockstone, smearing

          his feet, one with a shoe, one without, against the wall, he

          pushes grabbing further and further round the dark side of

          the chockstone, pulling with a silent, furious intensity.

          Hard, then harder, and HARDER.

                         BANG

          A second gun shot smashes around the canyon. He's sweating

          heavily and yet euphoric, possessed. He checks the underneath

          of the arm. It's broken too. Around the same place.

          He can rotate his forearm like a shaft inside a housing.

          Giving himself no time to wake up he grabs the knife, looks

          at the watch-

          He pushes the knife hard, to the hilt, in between 2 veins on

          his wrist.

          Fuck knows where the sweat is coming from but it's pouring

          out of him.

          Sawing downwards he makes as large a hole as he can without

          tearing any of the noodle like veins. He puts the knife in

          his teeth and pokes his left forefinger and thumb inside his

          right arm.

          Like a mechanic he looks to analyse and then he works by feel

          only.

          His sweat falls on his knife mixing with the blood.

          He pulls muscle nearer the surface allowing his knife to

          slice and pare away at a pinky 'finger-sized' fragment bit by

          bit. It takes a dozen actions, each time the knife goes back

          to his teeth.

          Sort. Pinch. Rotate. Slice.

          There's not a lot of blood. But he keeps working and working.

          Once the blood increases he puts the knife down on top of the

          rock and swiftly ties his tourniquet.

          He's silent, refusing to verbalize the pain.

          He can't cut the tendon, no matter how hard he slices. But

          nothing will stop his addiction to surgery now. He folds in

          and swaps the blade for the pliers. He uses them to bite into

          an edge of the yellowy tendon. Then squeezing and twisting he

          tears away a fragment.

          Grip. Squeeze. Twist. Tear.

          Finally he finishes the tendon.

          He returns to the knife. Finally all that remains inside is a

          pale white strand. Like swollen angel hair pasta. The nerve.

          He touches it with the knife edge.

                          ARON

           AAAAARRRRRGGGGHHHH!

          He explodes internally with vocal pain, through gritted

          teeth. The first time he has made any sound during the

          surgery. But it's like he's been taser-ed, he's stunned still

          He puts the knife in and pulls it toward him, an inch, two

          inches, it lengthens like pulling a guitar string.

          Unimaginable pain builds in his whole body, like he's pushing

          his arm into a cauldron of magma...

           68.

          (It's difficult to tell because everything is so tight and

          claustrophobic but maybe the boy is there intermittently

          riding his shoulders slipping across and around him, or

          obstructed by the boulder and stopped from getting to Aron)

          ...until it breaks. He shudders in shock and drops everything

          for minutes. His head lolls forward dripping. His mind

          swarming with trauma.

          And then he's back on the last action stretching the skin of

          his outer wrist tight and sawing the blade into the wall.

          It's a piece of gristle on a cutting board.

          Everything now is forcing us towards the boulder, cramping us

          in with him impossibly close, he's sweating and heaving, his

          vision blurring with tears, his contacts failing, his breath

          impossibly dry and rasping and then, as simply as this all

          began, his shoulders open and he's free......

          He staggers back, one, two, three steps away from his arm...

          His head swarming with colours, swooning, overpowering. He

          stares at his obituary as he's born again. His feet stagger

          under him like a new foal, an involuntary dance, we see

          colours bleeding and blending in his P.O.V.s and the colours

          invade our shots of him.

          then wrapping that with the yellow webbing he wore as a

          chocker to keep his neck warm in the night. He stuffs the

          repackaged arm into the empty Camelbak backpack and throws

          the straps over his neck to hold the arm in a makeshift

          sling.

          Packs his bag, water reservoir, full bottle of shiny urine,

          video, pocket knife. Grabs his climbing rope, messy and

          knotted from its use as insulation, and heads off down the

          canyon.

          Stops almost immediately and hesitates for a beat. He returns

           69.

          And now the motion and energy and life force of the action

          movie returns...

          It's like Ray Liotta's final day in Goodfellas; relentless,

          frustrating, pressure of life again now he's free from his

          tomb. Deeper and deeper, down and down into the swirling

          scoops of the sandstone. Couple of difficult manoeuvres, lots

          of slipping and bumping, despite his best effort occasionally

          his right shoulder takes the brunt and he stops, winces and

          grunts thru the pain.

          But on he goes, 100 ft of the rope trailing behind him. As

          we follow its progress snaking after him we see specs of

          blood on the lower walls.

          The canyon becomes a chute increasingly steep in which he

          ignores the shrinking daylight above because he has another

          target; the twists and turns of the curricles of sedimented

          sandstone lead to a soft glow, red, translucent, growing and

          growing in intensity. He pushes forward, the tail of rope

          whipping faster and faster along the walls and floor.

          INT/EXT. ROCK SHELF. DAY.

          Finally, we burst into the dazzling midday sun on a rock

          shelf halfway up a sheer walled amphitheatre, 200ft high. The

          scale of the slated cliff face opposite is breathtaking, the

          dazzling sunlight poaches the air he sucks in and burns his

          dry eyes.

          He sees, for the first time in his new life, green. The deep

          green of a healthy 50ft tree below him and to his left, and

          he knows. He looks for the bolts drilled into the rock, and

          he knows. Now he can look down. Right to the edge of

          vertiginous drop and there below is a puddle of shallow

          turgid water. Life itself. He wanted it to be there and now

          he's mesmerized by it. A pair of swifts leave the tree and

          zig zag up and around him. He wobbles and has to stop himself

          lunging head first over the precipice. Instead he drops to

          the bolts and kisses them like the pope arriving in a foreign

          land.

          Unravelling the rope of its knots, he's baking in blazing

           70.

          light. He can't go yet, every knot must be undone pulled open

          between his teeth and his hand. But he'll die if he can't

          have moisture. He tips the saved urine over himself and

          licking and retching simultaneously he suddenly stops and

          listens. He can hear a shuffling, a zip-zip... The rope is

          uncoiling over the ledge. He put it down to drink. Picking up

          speed the more it falls, there's only a few feet left. He

          lunges across the ledge and catches it just in time. That was

          his future disappearing over the ledge.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. CANYON. DAY

          We're far below - 6 storeys - and see him inch over the edge.

          Something's not right. It's a difficult overhang and he's

          awkward and vulnerable with only one useful arm. His bad arm

          catches horribly on the lip of the ledge. Suddenly he starts

          coming fast, faster and then hideously, much too fast,

          accelerating out of control and smashing into the water with

          deadly force.

          We're underneath, deep in the pool, and he crashes in an

          His feet gently touch the sandy floor, 10ft to the side of

          EXT. POOL. DAY

          ... he's a great climber and even in his present condition

          has perfectly executed the descent. And the pool is a puddle,

          swimming with dead leaves and insects, 2 inches deep at most.

          He falls on it with his bottles, filling them and dipping his

          mouth into the water, He washes his head, drinks and fills,

          drinks and gargles, and drinks again-insects, leaves,

          tadpoles, everything. Blood splashes in beside him so out

          comes his map again as he plots his way out. He sees a great

          goose- necked avenue before him bending to the right.

           71.

          Checking the map... there's a long way to go and he's small,

          He walks shedding any weight that might reduce how long he

          can keep going; his equipment, carabiners, headphones; his

          harness left like a spent snake skin behind him. He keeps to

          the shadows of the huge Monument Valley-like cliffs when he

          can.

          Finally, he comes to the great gallery that we saw in the

          opening titles. A 300ft huge wall with dozens of broad

          shouldered figures painted to enormous scale in all shades of

          tan and maroon. They seem to stare back at him. He salutes

          them in his own way and continues.

          He banks left beneath a colossal alcove high up in the cliff

          face and makes to the flattest ground - there's no shade to

          hide in here.

          70 yards ahead, 3 aliens are walking away from him. 2 tall,

          one shorter. All with elongated bodies and tiny heads,

          shimmering in the heat.

          He goes to shout but his voice catches. Then a feeble effort

          is lost in the vast scale of the canyon. The figures walk on

          bending and disappearing in the light. He digs deep.

                          ARON

           HELP!

          And the figures turn.

          There's a terrible pause of uncertainty on both sides and

          then he pushes out another heartbreaking -

                          ARON (CONT'D)

           HELP ME! I NEED HELP!

          The figures begin to run towards him. We watch his face in

          close up as they come. If tears come, then now they come at

          the sight of humans. He mutters to himself.

           72.

                          ARON (CONT'D)

           Hang in there Aron.

          At they get closer he summons a surge of energy from

          somewhere.

                          ARON (CONT'D)

           My name is Aron Ralston. I was

           trapped by a boulder on Saturday

           and I've been without food and

           water for 5 days. I cut my arm off

           this morning to get free and I've

           lost a lot of blood. I need medical

           attention.

          There's a pause as they look at this refugee from a low

          budget horror movie. He hungrily eyes the water bottles

          attached to their waist bands. This gives them a way in to

          his world. The moment is broken by their offering him their

          water. It pours down his throat bypassing the swallow

          mechanism.

                          CUT TO:

           76.

          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM. DAY.

          A very soft voice reading.

                          VOICE (MOM)

           ...his love, the peace that passeth

           all understanding...

                          ARON

           Mom.

                          MOM

           My boy. My only one. There you are.

          She strokes his head so gently.

                          ARON

           Hey Mom.

                          MOM

           How are you feeling?

                          ARON

           OK. Are you okay...

                          MOM

           You've been asleep for 2 days. We

           are so lucky...

          She's a decent woman and a devoted mum. She looks weary, worn

          out with worry and love for her boy.

                          ARON

           Mom, I'm sorry I scared you.

          Very soft voice (again) - Aron hears the same words as he

          drifts back into drugged rest.

                          VOICE (MOM)

           ...his love, the peace that passeth

           all understanding...

                          CUT TO:

          INT. UNDERWATER. DAY.

          Face underwater. Pull and kick. Wanting oxygen now.

                          INTERCUT WITH:

          INT. PRESS CONFERENCE. DAY.

           (all of this without

                          SOUND)

          Flash of celebrity. His first press conference. And boy, is

          there a lot of press there!

           77.

          Aron, of course has his camera with him as he walks out and

          takes a snap of the noise and light. We see his still, it's

          floor to ceiling, wall to wall journalists.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. POOL. DAY.

          We can see him beneath, swimming along the floor of the pool,

          like a diver building lung capacity.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. VAST CROWD. STADIUM. NIGHT.

          The vast crowd again, floodlit, ready to begin their evening.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. ARON'S TRUCK. NIGHT.

          In Aron's 4 x 4 somewhere in the endless parking lot outside

          the stadium. Rana is wearing glasses, reading an SMS she's

          just received.

                          RANA

           OK - he's got 3 vegetarian hotdogs

           and the tickets and he'll be

           outside Gate 6 in 5.

                          ARON

           So are you guys ok with me?

                          RANA

           Yeah. We split up a while back when

           you were in hospital.

                          ARON

           Christine told me.

                          RANA

           (always to the point)

           Is that what this is about?

                          ARON

           Yeah.

          She laughs at him.

                          RANA

           What about the climbing?

          Aron reaches in his bag and pulls out his scary looking

          prosthetic arm / axe. He clinks the points together. She

          doesn't laugh, maybe a smile.

           78.

                          RANA (CONT'D)

           Solo?

                          ARON

           I'm gonna finish the 49ers this

           winter or next.

                          RANA

           (to change it)

           Well, all I can't figure out is

           what took you so long to cut it off

           and get one of these.

          They both laugh. But he also answers.

                          ARON

           Rana, before I did it I was

           hallucinating, I saw this child, a

           little blond boy -

                          RANA

           (over her glasses)

           Not Jesus please...

                          ARON

           No, he looked like my cousin

           Charlie but way too young... and I

           didn't know why but I knew he was

           mine and that this was what lay in

           front of me.

          He looks at her.

          Pause.

          She doesn't say anything.

                          ARON (CONT'D)

           But it's not going to be you, is

           it?

                          RANA

           No Aron, it's not.

                          ARON

                          (HE KNOWS)

           OK.

          Rana leans over and tenderly kisses his cheek.

                          RANA

           You know, everyone who cares for

           you, a little bit of them dies each

           time you go back.

          Before he can work out how to answer she breaks the door

          open.

           79.

                          RANA (CONT'D)

           Let's go hero. If they do The Fly

           first and we miss it we'll never be

           forgiven.

          EXT. CONCERT. NIGHT.

          The concert explode into life.

          THE POP SONG PLAYS OVER:

          ` A man will rise, A man will fall...

          INT. UNDERWATER. DAY.

          His face pushing for the surface. He surges up and out of the

          water, to cling by his elbows on the side of the pool. No

          prosthetic.

          SONG CONTINUES OVER:

          ...From the sheer face of love

          Like a fly from a wall'

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. POOL. DAY.

          There in front of him on the grass by the pool is the same

          sofa as in the canyon. On it and around it, his friends and

          family, including Rana. There's so many of them they fill the

          screen. Tucked deep into the sofa, is his son giggling away.

          They smile, simple, silent support for him. He looks right

          back at them.

                                    THE END
