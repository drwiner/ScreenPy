                               Gregory Widen

1  EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                               1

   Garish purple light spills out of side-street porno houses,

   illuminating a silhouette, and little else, of a MAN leaning

   against an alley wall.

   He is waiting.

   Another silhouetted FIGURE appears and approaches the first.

   They size each other up as best they can.

                                FIRST MAN

                          MacLeod.

   The second nods.

   The first without hesitation raises a sword, the intended

   thrust interrupted by his own death as the second with a flash

   of metal severs the agressor's head.

2  INT. HUTCH - MORNING                                              2

   A 15th century Scottish home.

   A haggard WOMAN, her small CHILD clinging to a tattered apron,

   stands hunched over a glowing hearth.  Her veined hands drag

   a wooden spoon around and around through a soot-covered pot

   of grey soup.

   From an adjoining room CONOR MACLEOD, a young man dressed up

   in his best traditional Celtic tartan, enters.

                                MOTHER

                          My, but are you the

                          picture.

                                CONOR

                          (surveying himself)

                          It's a bit tight.

   His FATHER enters with a pail of milk.

                                FATHER

                          Ah, Conor, how you look

                          a man.

                                MOTHER

                          Have you time for some-

                          thing to eat?

                                CONOR

                          No, Mother.  They'll be

                          here shortly.

   Conor's father looks him over with pride.

                                FATHER

                          Your grandfather wore

                          that in his service to

                          the King, and I to fight

                          for the Duke.

                                MOTHER

                          Must he go?

                                FATHER

                          Aye.  It is his duty.  All

                          of ours.

                                MOTHER

                          But Ian, he's still but a boy.

                                FATHER

                          He's a MacLeod.

                                CONOR

                          I'll be fine Mother.

3  EXT. HUTCH - MORNING                                              3

   Several HORSEMEN gallop up through the early morning fog to

   the cottage door.

   Conor's father steps out to meet them.

4  EXT. HILLTOP - MORNING                                            4

   A massive KNIGHT sits astride his horse, moorish dew cling-

   ing to his helmet and breastplate.  A CLANSMAN hikes up the

   heather-carpeted slope to him.

                                CLANSMAN

                          They march.

                                KNIGHT

                          Is the boy among them?

                                CLANSMAN

                          Aye.

5  EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                                5

   The second kneels to examine the headless body of the first.

   With a CLACK a window, high on the alley wall, closes.

6  EXT. HIGHLAND PLAIN - MORNING                                     6

   The DUKE is leading a brigade of CLANSMEN out onto the plain.

   Mounted VASSALS ride back and forth inspecting the line.  The

   low fog makes it impossible to see beyond a few yards.  There

   is an erie, smothering silence.

                                VASSAL #1

                          Is a bad day for this.

                                VASSAL #2

                          The Duke has been compro-

                          mised.  He will have his due.

                                VASSAL #1

                          By day's end he will have

                          our heads.

                                VASSAL #2

                          We ride against the Suther-

                          lands.  That is all that

                          matters.

                                VASSAL #1

                          This makes no sense to me.

   CONOR

   And a friend are marching through the moist heather.

                                FRIEND

                          The fog is bad.  We cannot

                          even see the sides of our

                          own ranks.

   Conor's nervousness is showing.

                                FRIEND

                          Is this your first?

                                CONOR

                          Aye.

  SHOUTING is heard on the plain.

                                FRIEND

                          It's begun.

7  EXT. HILLTOP - MORNING                                            7

   The Knight, above the fog, hears the battle commence below.

   He spurs his horse and starts down into the mist.

8  EXT. PLAIN - MORNING                                              8

   The two opposing clans are now one confused mass of tartan

   and clashing swords.  The air is charged with SHOUTS of ex-

   citement, agony, and the SHRILL of bag pipes.

   The fog has made each man's battle his own, each isolated with

   his opponent.

   THE KNIGHT

   Rides calmly through the fracas.  He strikes and kills those

   that assault him, but appears disinterested in battle.

   He is looking.

   CONOR

   Is standing above the twitching body of his friend.

   Alone and confused, Conor has become seperated from the clan.

   He stumbles through the fog, seeking help.

   Suddenly he is alone with the Knight.

   The face of iron locks its gaze onto the boy.  His fear turned

   to panic, Conor turns and flees.

   The Knight, his resolve steeled in a raised sword, kicks his

   horse into persuit.

   Conor is easily overtaken and on his first pass the Knight

   brings his blade down hard into Conor's shoulder, slicing

   open most of the boy's back and knocking him face-first into

   the heather.

   As Conor watches his own blood spew forth, he rolls over in

   time to see the Knight dismount and start for him.

   THE KNIGHT

   Leans down next to Conor, his metal face nearly against the

   boy's.  His voice slithers out of the iron in almost a whisper.

                                KNIGHT

                          There can be but one.

   A CLANSMAN

   Charges out of the fog and attacks the Knight, who cuts him

   nearly in half.  ANOTHER wanders in and meets the same fate.

   The battle is shifting to where they are.

   Not finished yet with Conor, the Knight is finding himself

   forced into retreat from an ever increasing number of assail-

   ants.

   A VASSAL

   Sees his men being hacked apart trying to stop the now-mounted

   Knight.

                                VASSAL #1

                          Leave him!

   The clansmen obey.

   With the slap of an armored gauntlet against his steed, the

   Knight disappears into the fog.

   The Vassal surveys the carnage before him.  His eyes fall a

   moment on the moaning, gurgling Conor.

   The Vassal turns and leaves the boy for dead.

9  EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                                9

   A patrol car pauses at the mouth of the alley.

   The figure considers his situation, then quickly shoves his

   sword into a near-by drain.  He straightens up and waits.

   AN OFFICER

   Steps out of his unit and cautiously walks forward.  His PARTNER

   switches on the patrol car's side lamps, bathing the alley

   in a harsh glare.

   MAN IN ALLEY

   For the first time we can see his face.  RICHARD TAUPIN, clad

   in a well-cut business suit, looks exactly like Conor.

   The police officer, upon seeing the body, grabs instinctively

   for his pistol.  He yells to his partner now coming into the

   alley.

                                OFFICER #1

                          Kevin!  Get is a backup.

                                TAUPIN

                          I was merely walking by

                          when-

                                OFFICER #1

                          Don't move.

   The officer has his pistol out and leveled.

   His partner runs up, shotgun in hand.

                                OFFICER #2

                          They're on their way.

   His voice cuts short as the blood flows against his shoe.

                                OFFICER #2

                          Christ.

10  INT. HUTCH - NIGHT                                              10

    Conor lies moaning on a cot.  Makeshift bandages wrap his

    body, stained and pasted by thick, dried blood.

    The family surrounds their dying son.

    A PRIEST is delivering the last rites.

                                PRIEST

                          ...Libera Domine Animan

                          servi tui sicut libertasi

                          David de manu regis Saul...

    His sobbing mother holds a compress to Conor's forehead.

                                PRIEST

                          ...In mamus tuas domine

                          commendo spiritum meum...

11  EXT. HUTCH - NIGHT                                              11

    A Vassal rides up to the hutch, dismounts, and approaches a

    CLANSMAN standing in the open doorway.

                                VASSAL #1

                          Has the boy died?

                                CLANSMAN

                          He is having the last rites

                          now.  It should be over by

                          morning.

                                VASSAL #1

                          Never seen anybody cut as

                          bad live so long.  He should

                          have died on the field.

                                CLANSMAN

                          Tonight or tomorrow, it's

                          all the same.

    The Vassal peers inside at the priest administering the

    sacraments.

                                PRIEST

                          ...Auditorium nostrum in

                          nomine domini...

                                VASSAL #1

                          This has been a dark day.

                                PRIEST

                          ...Requiescant in pace...

12  EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                              12

    There is a bustle of activity.  Setting up barricades, uni-

    formed OFFICERS are trying to keep NEW CREWS and curious

    ONLOOKERS at a distance.

    DETECTIVE LT. MORAN

    Lean, fortyish, and comfortable with the gore in front of him,

    is inspecting the corpse with a MEDICAL EXAMINER.

                                EXAMINER

                             (studying body)

                          Real clean.  No sawing

                          action at all.  Whatever

                          it was did it in one

                          swipe.

                           (looks up at Moran)

                          Like the other one.

    Moran gestures to a sword, wrapped in plastic, lying nearby.

                                MORAN

                          What about that?

                                EXAMINER

                          Hasn't any blood on it.

                                MORAN

                             (looking around)

                          About the only thing

                          that doesn't.

                                EXAMINER

                          I'll give it a closer

                          look when I get back.

    BRENNA CARTWRIGHT

    Pretty but not beautiful, thirtyish, she exudes a sort of

    insolent intelligence.

    An OFFICER sees her duck under a police barricade.

                                OFFICER #3

                          Come on Brenna, you know

                          better than that.

                                BRENNA

                          I'm invited.

    She walks to where the medical examiner is organizing his

    equipment.

                                BRENNA

                              (greeting)

                          Mr. Levine...

    The examiner turns and smiles.

                                EXAMINER

                          Hope this isn't past your

                          bedtime.

    Brenna looks to the now-sheeted corpse, blood flowing from

    where the head should be.

                                BRENNA

                          Doesn't have a head,

                          does he?

                                EXAMINER

                          This one came unassembled.

    Lt. Moran is standing near.

                                MORAN

                             (no warmth)

                          Just show her what she came

                          for, Tom.

                                EXAMINER

                        (stands, taps Brenna's arm)

                          Come on, this is more

                          your line of work.

    Brenna and the examiner walk the few yards from the corpse

    to the sword.

                                EXAMINER

                          How's your uncle?  I hardly

                          ever see him anymore.

                                BRENNA

                          Fine.

    The examiner stops and gestures to the weapon clothed in

    forensic plastic.

                                EXAMINER

                          There you go.

    Brenna's expression changes to interest as she kneels down

    beside it.

                                EXAMINER

                          Didn't look like it came from

                          "Toys-Are-Us", that's why I

                          called you.

                                BRENNA

                        (looks up in Moran's direction)

                          Didn't think it was my

                          buddy over there.

                                EXAMINER

                          Figured you knew more about

                          swords than I did.

                          Huh?

                                BRENNA

                          Scottish claymore.  Take

                          a French epee, add twenty

                          pounds of ballast so it

                          means business, and you've

                          got a claymore.

                                EXAMINER

                          You're the expert.

    RICHARD TAUPIN

    Is being put in the rear of a patrol car.  Brenna studies his

    face in the half-gloom.  There's something different about him.

    A steadiness.

13  INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM                                  13

    Richard Taupin is seated at a graffitti scrawled table in a

    room otherwise bare of furnishings.  He seems unphased by his

    surroundings.

    The door opens and Moran enters with bag and notebook.  He

    picks up Taupin's wallet on the table top and checks the

    driver's license.

                                MORAN

                          This your present address?

                                TAUPIN

                          Yes.

                                MORAN

                          Mr.-

                          (looks at license)

                          Taupin, what were you

                          doing in that alley?

                                TAUPIN

                          I was walking by when I

                          heard a shout.  Your men

                          came right after.

                                MORAN

                          Did you know the victim?

                                TAUPIN

                          No.

                                MORAN

                          His name was Iman Fasil

                          if that jogs your memory.

                                TAUPIN

                          It doesn't.

                                MORAN

                          He was carrying a Syrian

                          passport and had been in

                          the country less than a week.

    Taupin's face is stoic and controlled.

                                MORAN

                          Two days ago a Bulgarian

                          national was murdered the

                          same way.  He'd also been

                          in the country less than a

                          week.

                                (beat)

                          What is your citizenship?

                                TAUPIN

                          American.

    Moran paces to a corner of the room.

                                MORAN

                          Do you make a habit of

                          hanging out in that neigh-

                          borhood at night?

                                TAUPIN

                          What are you getting at?

                                MORAN

                          Let's just say that in my

                          years with this department

                          I've seen more than one well

                          dressed business man look for

                          a hand job on 14th Street.

    Moran places both hands on the table and leans across it.

                                MORAN

                          What were _you_ looking for?

                                TAUPIN

                          That's none of your business.

                                MORAN

                          You're wrong.

    Moran reaches into a bag on the table and removes a large

    broad sword; old, but in mint condition.

                                MORAN

                          Do you know what this is?

                                TAUPIN

                          I presume it's a sword.

                                MORAN

                          A claymore to be exact.  You

                          wouldn't know anything about

                          it would you?

                                TAUPIN

                          Your murder weapon?

                                MORAN

                          It was covered with Mr.

                          Fasil's fingerprints, but

                          none of his blood.

                                TAUPIN

                          A mystery.

                                MORAN

                          For the moment.

    Moran turns the sword over in his hand then sets it down.

    He rises and opens the door.

                                MORAN

                          All right Mr. Taupin, we'll be in

                          touch.

    Taupin passes through the doorway without comment.

14  EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT                                     14

    Taupin out into the crisp night air.  His eyes search out the

    darkness.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

15  EXT. CONOR'S FAMILY HUTCH - DAY                                 15

    A medieval sun beats down on an OLD TRAVELER making his way up

    the MacLeod home.  Conor's mother, scrubbing clothes in a

    bucket, smiles in recognition.

                                MOTHER

                          Ah Steven, it is good to see you.

                                TRAVELLER

                          I only just heard of Conor.  I came

                          up from Catroch as soon as I could.

                                MOTHER

                          You're a kind man to be sure.

                                TRAVELLER

                          I thought it only proper to pay

                          me last respects to the family.

                                MOTHER

                          Steven, Conor didn't die.

                                TRAVELLER

                          But I had heard his wounds were

                          mortal.

                                MOTHER

                          They were Steven, they were.  It's

                          been a miracle it has.  He lasted

                          right through and healed.  No one

                          in the village has ever seen anything

                          like it.  Ever.

16  EXT. MEADOW - DAY                                               16

    Perched on a heather-carpeted rise above the village a young

    woman, MARA, sits contemplating the intricaces of a daffodil.

    Balancing on a shepard's staff, Conor limps over and puts

    his lips to her ear.

                                CONOR

                          You're pretty today.

    Mara is silent.  Distant.

                                CONOR

                          I'm your future husband, remember?

                                MARA

                          I have no future husband.

                                CONOR

                          I don't understand.  Not a week

                          ago your father gave us his blessing.

    This is difficult for her.  Tears well in her eyes.

                                MARA

                          My future husband died in battle

                          against the Sutherlands.

                                CONOR

                          What are you saying?  I'm standing

                          here as real as you.

                                MARA

                          You cannot be real, Conor.  You had

                          the last rites.  No man has been cut

                          half as bad and lived.

                                CONOR

                          But I did live.

                                MARA

                          Live?  In less than a week you're

                          prancing about the country like a

                          squirrel.

                                CONOR

                          So why the crazy talk?  It's a

                          miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has

                          smiled on me.  On us.

                                MARA

                          Some think not.

                                CONOR

                          Who?

                                MARA

                          There's rumor in the village.

                          Some call it magic.

                                CONOR

                          That's mad.  Surely you don't

                          take their word?

                                MARA

                          I don't know, Conor.  It's not

                          natural.  Maybe something has

                          touched you.

                                CONOR

                          You're sounding like that mad

                          woman, Widow Baggins.

                                MARA

                          Me father has taken back my

                          hand.

    He puts a hand to her cheek.

                                CONOR

                          Ah, Lassie...

    She steps back.

                                MARA

                          Please not be touching me, Conor.

                                CONOR

                          I'll not take that kind of talk

                          from you.  From those others

                          below, maybe.  But not from you.

                                MARA

                          Leave me alone, Conor.  Please.

                                CONOR

                          You're not talking sense, Mara!

    Anger tumbles into exasperation.

                                CONOR

                          I'm sorry.

    He steps for her.  She moves away.  Conor's face hardens with

    resentment.

                                CONOR

                          If you send me away now, Mara,

                          I'll not come looking for you.

                                MARA

                             (crying)

                          Do what you must.

    Resigned, Conor turns and limps away.

    Brenna Cartwright stands in Taupin's cluttered surroundings

    admiring a bagpipe set neatly on a shelf.

                                BRENNA

                          Do you play?

    Taupin sits down and begins sorting through a stack of papers

                          well looked after all these years.

                                TAUPIN

                          Miss Cartwright, unless you have

                          come here to sell the sword,

                          there's very little I can help

                          you with.  Now if you will excuse

                          me, I have a great deal of work

                          to do.

    Brenna has taken a carving from the shelf.

                                BRENNA

                          Byzantine?

                                TAUPIN

                          Basil the II.

                                BRENNA

                          Charming guy, Basil.  Once after

                          beating an army of Serbians he

                          blinded all but-

                                TAUPIN

                          -All but one out of a hundred, I

                          know.  All left to be led like

                          donkeys back home.  Now if you will

                          please-

    Brenna suddenly tosses the carving at him.  Taupin snatches it

    out of the air with lightning precision.

                                BRENNA

                          Good reflexes.

                                TAUPIN

                          Good day, Miss Cartwright.

19  INT. SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM DEPARTMENT OFFICE                       19

    A lonely, ancient room full of equal parts dust and oaken

    study tables.

    The department SUPERVISOR sits at his desk surrounded by a

    handful of his staff RESEARCHERS - Brenna included.  A faded,

    stern portrait of some forgotten curator presides over propped

    up feet, cold coffee, and half eaten sack lunches.

                                BRENNA

                          I don't believe him.

                                SUPERVISOR

                          Why?

                                BRENNA

                          He's too cool.  Too sharp.  I

                          think he's got something to

                          do with it.

                                RESEARCHER #1

                          Oh, has your penetrating research

                          on 9th Century Lithuanian dildos

                          suddenly made you an expert on the

                          criminal mentality?

                                BRENNA

                          Screw off, Larry.

    The men, LAUGH.  They delight in baiting her.

    Researcher #2 opens a Budweiser and pours the beer into a medieval

    mug he's borrowed from the collection.

                                RESEARCHER #2

                          The cops bought it.  They let him

                          go.

                                BRENNA

                          What could they hold him for?  I

                          think they're just waiting for

                          something concrete before they

                          haul him in for real.  We should

                          look into it.  He had to have

                          gotten that sword from somewhere.

                                SUPERVISOR

                          Hang on a sec, you did your little

                          favor for the boys downtown, I'm

                          sure your uncle and the rest are

                          perfectly capable of taking it

                          from here.

                                BRENNA

                          I've seen nobleman swords that

                          weren't as well preserved.  It's

                          just a hunk of peasant iron.  Why

                          would he be carrying it around

                          in an alley?

                                RESEARCHER #1

                          Here we go.  Everytime there's a

                          murder in town we have to put up

                          with junior D.A.

                                BRENNA

                          Someone should check him out.

                          Maybe a collection somewhere

                          got knocked over.  He has one,

                          he might have two.

                                SUPERVISOR

                          You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see

                          the crap piled up on it?

                                BRENNA

                          Give it a rest Ned, huh?

                                RESEARCHER #2

                          Might be interesting to see what

                          his family connections are.  That's

                          a hell of a piece to be just chuck-

                          ing around in an alley.

                                SUPERVISOR

                                  (sighs)

                          I swear to God Brenna, between you

                          and Thompson's novels I'm going to

                          get a bloody ulcer.

    Researcher #2 lifts the mug of beer to his mouth.

                                                                CUT TO:

    An empty mug is set on the counter of a medieval drinking

    establishment.

    CLANSMEN, their faces and clothes smudged with a day's work in

    the fields, relax and enjoy the company of their fellow VILLAGERS.

    No longer requiring the use of a cane, Conor enters.

                                CONOR

                              (to owner)

                          Evening, Douglas.

                                DOUGLAS

                          Conor.

    The tavern goes silent.  Wary.  The attention is on Conor.

                                CONOR

                          Ale suits me.

    The owner unenthusiastically fills Conor a mug.  Conor takes

    it and walks to where four other VILLAGERS sit.

                                TAVERN MAN #1

                          We rather you not be sitting with

                          us, Conor.

    Conor looks to the next table.

                                TAVERN MAN #2

                          We be drinking alone as well.

    The entire tavern spells the same sentiments.

                                CONOR

                          What's wrong with you all?

    Silence.

    Angered, Conor approaches the second man.  As he looms above

    his chair the man in genuine fear pulls out a cross and thrusts

    it forward.

                                TAVERN MAN #2

                          Requiem acer'nam donaei-

                                CONOR

                          What are you doing man?

                                TAVERN MAN #2

                          -Et lux perpetua-

                                CONOR

                          You'll not be bringing the church

                          into this.

                                TAVERN MAN #2

                          -Luceat ei-

    The weird display frightens Conor.

                                CONOR

                          Be quiet.

                                TAVERN MAN #2

                          -Auditorium nostrum-

                                CONOR

                          Stop.

                                TAVERN MAN #2

                          -In nomine sanctus esperitu-

                                CONOR

                          Stop!

    Conor HURLES his mug against the wall.

    His nerves shattered, he rushes out.

21  INT. MACLEOD HUTCH                                              21

    Conor packs a satchel with his few clothes and belongings.

    He walks to the doorway where his mother and father wait.

    His mother, tears on her cheek, hugs him tightly.

                                MOTHER

                          Please take care of yourself.

                                CONOR

                          Aye.

    Conor turns to his father.

                                FATHER

                          I wish there was some other way.

    They clasp hands.

                                FATHER

                          Goodbye, Conor.

                                CONOR

                          Goodbye.

    Without looking back he passes through the doorway and down the

    empty path, his figure quickly fading in the moorish fog.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

    The NOISY business-as-usual confusion at the Washington P.D.

    processing center.

    Amongst the dinge of CLANGING phones and CLACKING typewriters,

    a uniformed OFFICER enters something into a computer terminal.

    Brenna sits perched on a desk nearby.

                                DESK OFFICER

                          This is against the rules.

                          March 16, 1945 in Church Hill,

                          Church Hill, that's pretty close,

                          isn't it?

23  EXT. GEORGETOWN STREET - DAY                                    23

    Taupin steps out of a Metro station and walks the few blocks

    to his brick townhouse.  Climbing the front stairs, he fishes

    his keys out of a coat pocket.  About to insert the key he stops,

    sensing something.

    Backing down the steps, Taupin slips around to the rear of the

    building.

24  INT. TAUPIN HOME                                                24

    Like a spider Taupin pries open a window and slips silently

    inside.

    The home is dark and still.

    Taupin creeps down the hallway and peers into the entryway.

    There a MAN, dressed in a tuxedo jacket and nearly imperceptible

    in the dim light, is crouched at the front door.

    He is holding a sword.

    Taupin removes a knife from his pocket and JUMPS the intruder.

    The two STRUGGLE fiercely.

    Taupin pins the intruder against the carpet and shoves his

    knife firmly against the man's throat.

                                TAUPIN

                          Where is he?

    Bulging eyes stare at him.

                                TAUPIN

                          Where!

                                INTRUDER

                          I don't know.

                                TAUPIN

                          What name is he using?

    Taupin presses the blade.  A trickle of blood rolls down the

    throat.

                                INTRUDER

                          Smith.  Carl Smith.

                                TAUPIN

                          How many came?

                                INTRUDER

                          The last four.

                                TAUPIN

                          And the Bulgarian?

                                INTRUDER

                          He got him.

                             (hoarse chuckle)

                          He always does.  Eventually.

                                TAUPIN

                          He knows I'm here.  How?

                                INTRUDER

                          None of this would be happening

                          if you hadn't run...

    The knife is pressed deeper.

                                TAUPIN

                          _Answer_ me.

                          We learned he'd found the immigration

                          notaries in Liverpool and traced them

                          to New York.  Then he figured out the

                          birth records in Church Hill...

    Nothing.  She closes the book and drums her fingers on the cover.

27  EXT. COUNTY RECORDS OFFICE - DAY                                27

    An 1860s stone columned affair, far more impressive than the

    low-lying town that surrounds it.

    Brenna enters.

28  INT. COUNTY RECORDS OFFICE                                      28

    Brenna sits sifting through a large cloth-bound book entitled

    _Certificates of Birth: 1941-1948_.

                                BRENNA

                              (reading)

                          Tarmin...Tatum...Taupin, Richard

                          Marshall.  Born to William and

                          Karen Taupin, no address.  Attend-

                          ing physician, Dr. Willis Kidell.

29  INT. DR. KIDELL'S HOME                                          29

    Dr. Kidell stands at his bookcase leafing through a binder.

                                KIDELL

                          1945, that strains the memory.

                               (after a fashion)

                          Here we are, Richard Taupin.

    He carries the binder to the table where Brenna sits.

                                KIDELL

                          Would you like more tea?

                                BRENNA

                          No thank you, I'm fine.

    Kidell sips his own and looks over the binder page.

                                KIDELL

                          He was unsual.

                                BRENNA

                          Why?

                                KIDELL

                          Well, this is a small town, and

                          it was even smaller then.  Most

                          all the babies I delivered were

                          from local families.  Richard's

                          parents were just passing through

                          when his mother's time came.  I

                          did it right here at the house.

                                BRENNA

                          Then you didn't know Richard

                          later on.

                                KIDELL

                          No.

                                BRENNA

                          I've been trying to find somebody

                          who knew him and any connections

                          his family might have had with

                          museums or historical societies.

                                KIDELL

                          Don't know about any of that.

                          Suppose nobody does.

                                BRENNA

                          I don't follow you.

                                KIDELL

                          Poor little tyke didn't have a

                          chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He

                          died a few days after he was born.

                                BRENNA

                          The boy _died_?

                                KIDELL

                          Mother too.  Sad case it was.  The

                          young lady just couldn't make it

                          through labor.  Never even saw her

                          son.

    Dr. Kidell removes from the binder a tattered newspaper clipping.

                                KIDELL

                          My brother worked for the town

                          paper at the time.  He took this

                          picture of the funeral.

    Something in the clipping sparks Brenna's interest.

                                BRENNA

                          Have you spoken to anyone else

                          about this?

                                KIDELL

                          There was this one fella.  Asked

                          a lot of questions.  I was out

                          of town but I heard he spent near

                          a full day in the records office.

                                BRENNA

                          Would you remember his name?

                                KIDELL

                               (thinks)

                          Carl Smith.

30  INT. POLICE STATION                                             30

    A police line-up.

    Seven MEN, all dressed in Santa Claus outfits with bare legs,

    are paraded for a small, old LADY.

                                OFFICER

                          Just tell us when you see the one.

    Several rows back in the dark sits Brenna's UNCLE JOE, the

    district attorney, and another man, his ASSISTANT.

                                UNCLE JOE

                          Forget it.

                                BRENNA

                          I'm just curious.

                                UNCLE JOE

                          You're never "just curious".

                               (to assistant)

                          You've met my neice, Brenna.

                                ASSISTANT

                          Hi Brenna.

                                OFFICER

                              (to line-up)

                          Number 5, lift your coat up more.

                                UNCLE JOE

                          Aren't you getting a little old for

                          this?  You flunked out of law school.

                                BRENNA

                             (rolls her eyes)

                          Now there's a new topic.

                                UNCLE JOE

                          Don't they have enough for you to

                          do at the castle?

    Brenna puts on her best little-girl angelic smile, a smile her

    uncle can never refuse.

                                UNCLE JOE

                                  (sighs)

                          Forgers do it all the time.  They

                          take the birth certificate of some-

                          one who died young and use it to

                          get legit I.D.  Usually they carry

                          it long enough to pass some bad

                          checks then dump it.

                                BRENNA

                          Thanks.

                                UNCLE JOE

                          Call your mother.  You never call her.

                                OFFICER

                              (to old lady)

                          Well?

                                OLD LADY

                          I don't know.  I'd have to see his

                          thing.

31  INT. BRENNA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                   31

    A swath of moonlight shines in across a carafe-turned-vase,

    a New England college diploma, and a police uniform hanging

    from the bedpost where Brenna lies with another man, DENNIS.

                                BRENNA

                          I can't figure out why he's doing it.

                          He's been Richard Taupin at least

                          since 1967.  And the guys rich.  You

                          should see the stuff he has in that shop.

                                DENNIS

                          Maybe he's hiding from something.

                                BRENNA

                          Some guy named Smith was asking

                          about him in Church Hill.  I passed

                          his name around with your buddies

                          downtown but they drew a blank.  So

                          he isn't a cop.  District anyway.

    Dennis gets out of bed and begins putting on his uniform.

                                DENNIS

                          Probably just some exec ducking

                          an ex-wife.

                                BRENNA

                          Dr. Kidell had a picture in his

                          file of the funeral.  The father

                          looked just like Richard.  Even had

                          a mark on his cheek.

                                DENNIS

                          How old is Richard?

                                BRENNA

                          P.D. says 41, but he barely looks

                          30.

                                DENNIS

                          Find the father.  That should clear

                          things up.

    He buttons his shirt.  Something occurs to him.

                                DENNIS

                          Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran

                          picked up the other night?

                                BRENNA

                          Yeah.

                                DENNIS

                          He'd want to know about all this.

                                BRENNA

                          Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his

                          own clues.  There's a journal article

                          in this somewhere.

                                DENNIS

                              (shakes head)

                          Uncle Joey's little girl.  Can't

                          get the taste out of her mouth.

    Dennis puts on his police cap.

                                DENNIS

                          Well, the cream of society awaits.

                              (cocks hat to one side)

                          If you're ever in the neighborhood...

                                BRENNA

                          Sure.

32  EXT. RIVER EMBANKMENT - NIGHT                                   32

    POLICE OFFICERS, their flashlights cutting the darkness, search

    the mud shores of a Potomac tidal basin.  The glowing Jefferson

    Memorial can be seen in the distance.

    DETECTIVE MORAN

    Is supervising.  An OFFICER climbs up the embankment to him.

                                OFFICER

                          They found it.

    The officer leads him down to the river where a headless BODY

    wearing a tuxedo jacket is being put into a plastic bag.

                                OFFICER

                          It was about fifty yards down-

                          stream from the head.

    Moran looks down at the body bag, its dark plastic reflecting

    the rythmic rotation of squad car beacons.

                                OFFICER

                          Both were cut real clean.  Like the

                          other ones...

33  EXT. EQUESTRIAN RIDING GROUNDS - DAY                            33

    A steeple-chase course lies shrouded in an Arlington fog.

    Across the damp grass a lone horse, heaving clouds of warm

    breath, leaps gracefully over a hurdle.  Driving the steed

    hard through the course, Taupin pulls firm on the reins,

    bringing horse and rider to a shuddering stop where Detective

    Moran waits.

                                MORAN

                          There's been another murder.

    Taupin lifts his eyes to the suburban treeline.

                                TAUPIN

                          My condolences.

                                MORAN

                          Where were you Tuesday night?

                                TAUPIN

                          Home.

                                MORAN

                          A neighbor saw your car leave.

                                TAUPIN

                          He's mistaken.

    Taupin climbs down from his horse.  Moran moves close.

                                MORAN

                          Look, I don't know what the hell

                          you're up to, but I think I've got

                          a pretty good idea.

                                TAUPIN

                          Do you?

                                MORAN

                          All I need is time.

                                TAUPIN

                          I've got all the time in the world.

                             (looks at watch)

                          Except right now.  If you will excuse

                          me, Lieutenant.

    In no hurry, Taupin leads his horse away.

34  INT. MUSEUM RESEARCH DEPARTMENT                                 34

    Brenna sits surrounded by books of old English law, colorful

    family banner plates, and a medieval caltrap sitting on her

    desk corner.

    Boring quickly, she shuts the book and sighs.  From another

    folder she pulls out a computer sheet.

    INSERT COMPUTER SHEET

    The police sheet has Taupin's name and motor vehicle record.

    Below are listed four WILLIAM TAUPINS, their hometowns and

    driving records.  Richard Taupin's first driver permit was in

    1967.

    Brenna looks down the list to a WILLIAM TAUPIN of Felton,

    Delaware, who stopped filling for driver permits in 1967, the

    year Richard started.

35  EXT. GAS STATION - DAY                                          35

    Dropping a couple of quarters into a vending machine, Brenna

    removes and opens up a map of the State of Delaware.

36  EXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY                                            36

    Brenna steps out of her car at a small town cemetary.

    Holding a slip of paper, she weaves her way through the shade

    covered tombs of revolutionary heroes and their descendants.

    On a small rise fresh dirt lies in careless piles around an

    open grave.

    Richard Taupin stands at the mouth of the pit.

    A coffin has been brutally pulled from the dirt and lies open

    and propped diagonally beside a marker that reads: "WILLIAM

    MICHAEL TAUPIN".

    The casket is empty.

                                BRENNA

                          Someone beat you.

                                TAUPIN

                          Have you taken to touring small

                          town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?

                                BRENNA

                          Grave robbers?

                                TAUPIN

                          Probably.

                                BRENNA

                          Who?

                                TAUPIN

                          People like that rarely leave

                          business cards.

                                BRENNA

                          Does Carl Smith?

    A flash of interest, quickly suppressed.

                                TAUPIN

                          I don't know what you're talking

                          about.

                                BRENNA

                          I think you do.  Better yet, I don't

                          think anything was stolen because

                          nothing was there in the first place.

                          And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is,

                          now knows that.

                                TAUPIN

                          You have an active imagination.

                                BRENNA

                          I've been to Church Hill.

                                TAUPIN

                          Miss Cartwright, you are

                          involving yourself in

                          matters that do not concern

                          you.  I strongly suggest you

                          return to Washington and stay

                          out of small town cemetaries.

    He starts for the gate.

                                BRENNA

                          I could find him.

    Taupin stops.

                                BRENNA

                          I have friends.

                                TAUPIN

                          I doubt that.

                                 (beat)

                          Good day, Miss Cartwright.

    He walks on.

    After only a few paces Taupin suddenly shudders to an abrupt

    stop.

                                BRENNA

                          What's wrong?

    He holds up an open palm to silence her.

                                TAUPIN

                          Your help may be unneccessary.

    The air is still.

    Taupin's face is expressionless.  He listens intently.  Sensing.

    An unseen voice rides seemingly on the wind.

                                VOICE

                                (o.s.)

                          Good afternoon, "Mr. Taupin".

    Taupin whirls around to see a large man standing with broad

    sword in hand.  We have never seen the knight out of his armor

    before, but this man certainly seems to fit the bill.  Wearing

    Levis and leather jacket in contrast to Taupin's expensive

    business suit, he speaks with icy evenness from a face of stone.

    Taupin, naked without his own sword, is trapped against a

    marble wall.

                                KNIGHT

                          Long time.

                                TAUPIN

                          Not so long.

    The Knight is closing in on him, sword gripped in both hands.

                                TAUPIN

                          You've been here from the

                          start.

                                KNIGHT

                          My quarry grows clever with

                          age.  And the others, incompetent.

    The Knight throws Brenna a glance.

                                KNIGHT

                          Friend of yours?

                                TAUPIN

                          Of sorts.

                                KNIGHT

                          I do hope she enjoys a good

                          show.

    The Knight leans his whole body into a two-fisted swing,

    clanging out a chunk of marble as Taupin ducks.

    A second swipe also imbeds itself in stone.

                                KNIGHT

                          So now it ends.

    A thrust cuts only air.

                                KNIGHT

                          Generation upon generation.

                          Tens of thousands of miles.

    Taupin leaps behind a tree.  The Knight cuts it nearly in half.

                                KNIGHT

                          You're the last, MacLeod.

                          Romirez, Lacroux, Neuvich,

                          those fools that followed

                          me, their heads all line my

                          shelf.  All but yours.

    Taupin drops to the ground in a shoulder roll to avoid a swipe.

                                KNIGHT

                          Can you feel it, MacLeod?

                          Can you _feel_ it!

    Taupin grabs a tree branch and raps the Knight on the knee,

    knocking him over.

    The Knight quickly rights himself and cuts the branch from

    Taupin.

                                KNIGHT

                          There can be but one.

    He raises his blade.

    An elderly WATCHMAN, shotgun cradled in his arms, stands in

    the clearing.

                                WATCHMAN

                          Hey!  What's going on here?

    The Knight pauses a split second then with decision launches

    his sword spear-style firmly into the watchman's chest.

    Taupin pushes past him to Brenna.

                                TAUPIN

                          Run!

    Brenna is frozen in shock.

    Taupin shoves her roughly toward the gate.

                                TAUPIN

                          Run!

                                KNIGHT

                          MACLEOD!

    The Knight retrieves his sword from the watchman's body and

    lumbers after them.

    Taupin and Brenna bolt from the cemetary and into the surround-

    ing residential area.

37  EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY                                   37

    Taupin leads an exhausted Brenna in a gallop down the side-

    walk.

    They have apparently lost the Knight.  Taupin pauses at a

    corner.  He sees a church across the street.

38  INT. CHURCH                                                     38

    Brenna enters and collapses into a pew, her labored breathing

    echoing off the high ceiling.

    Taupin walks the length of an aisle to see that they are alone.

    Satisfied, he leans against a banister and considers his sit-

    uation.

    Trying to recover her wind, Brenna has her eyes closed and

    head against the back of the pew.

                                BRENNA

                          Jesus Christ.

                                TAUPIN

                          You'll be safe here.  He won't

                          kill in a church.

                                BRENNA

                          Why not?

                                TAUPIN

                              (distracted)

                          Tradition.

                                BRENNA

                          What the hell is going on?

    Taupin stares out the window, stained glass shining orange on

    his face.  He looks at Brenna briefly, then passes through the

    Church's doorway without a word.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

39  INT. MEDIEVAL BLACKSMITH SHOP                                   39

    A glowing horseshoe HISSES wildly as it slips into a wooden

    cooling bucket.  Pulling it out with iron tongs, Conor lays

    it on a counter and pounds it even with a mallet.

    Sweaty and streaked with dirt, he tosses the mallet aside

    and walks out into the late afternoon sunshine.

40  EXT. SHOP FRONTAGE - DAY                                        40

    Conor leans over a water barrel and dunks his head and arms,

    cleaning off a day's worth of sweat and grime.

    JUAN ROMIREZ

    Stirring up dust with his travelling boots, this Spanish acc-

    ented man stops at Conor's shop.  He wears a large broad sword

    strapped to his waist.

                                CONOR

                          Afternoon.

                                ROMIREZ

                          Your name is Conor?

                                CONOR

                          Aye.

                                ROMIREZ

                             (bows slightly)

                          Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief

                          surveyor and alchemist.

                                CONOR

                             (notices accent)

                          You're not from these

                          parts.

                                ROMIREZ

                          I am from Spain.  And I

                          would like a moment of

                          your time.

41  INT. CONOR'S HOME                                               41

    Romirez is seated at a table.  His back to the Spaniard,

    Conor is preparing some food.

                                CONOR

                          I haven't much to offer,

                          Mr. Romirez from Spain,

                          but you're welcome to what's

                          here.

                                ROMIREZ

                          Please go to no trouble.

    Romirez is looking at the faint, pale hint of a scar that

    runs from Conor's shoulder blade to his waist.

                                ROMIREZ

                          Your back, it would seem

                          perhaps you were injured

                          in battle?

                                CONOR

                          Five years past me clan

                          fought another over some-

                          thing I cannot even re-

                          member.

                                ROMIREZ

                          Your marks would suggest

                          great injury.

                                CONOR

                          I was nearly killed.

                                ROMIREZ

                          But you lived.

    Conor looks up from his work in pained memory.

                                CONOR

                          I did at that.

                                ROMIREZ

                          And but for a mark you are

                          well as any man, no?

                                CONOR

                          Aye.

                                ROMIREZ

                          I should imagine that your

                          recovery must have alarmed

                          your fellow villagers, perhaps

                          giving them reason to invent

                          an explanation.  And a solution.

    Something isn't right.

    Conor turns and faces him.

                                CONOR

                          I was driven out.

                                ROMIREZ

                          And now you live in a small

                          village miles away from all

                          you knew.

                                CONOR

                          How can you know this?

                                ROMIREZ

                             (tone lightens)

                          First food, no?  A good meal

                          makes conversation so much

                          easier.

    Stunned with the implications of what Romirez has said, like

    a robot Conor serves the meal.  His eyes never leave Romirez,

    who digs hungrily into the food.

                                ROMIREZ

                          Hmm, que rico.  What is it you

                          call this?

                                CONOR

                          Pheasant.

                                ROMIREZ

                          You Scots have a way with

                          game.  It still has life in it.

                          Spirit.  Back home the food

                          is so...domestic.

                                CONOR

                          Why are you here?

                                ROMIREZ

                          I was sent by his majesty of

                          Spain to Inverness as a con-

                          sultant on matters of metal.

                                CONOR

                          You're a long way from Inverness.

                                ROMIREZ

                          In my travels I heard the story of

                          the MacLeod boy struck down and

                          brought from the hand of

                          death by powers not of this Earth.

                                CONOR

                          You know me home.  Me name.

                                ROMIREZ

                          It was time for our paths to cross.

    Romirez pulls back the sleeve on his cloak.

                                ROMIREZ

                          You see this?

    He traces some discoloration on his arm.

                                ROMIREZ

                          When I was a boy a cart driven

                          by a drunken fool crushed me.  All

                          thought I would die or be maimed

                          for life.  But I healed quickly.

                          And like you I paid the price

                          for being different.

                                CONOR

                          You are the same?

                                ROMIREZ

                          Do you ever feel a flow, as if some-

                          thing were pushing against you?

                                CONOR

                          Yes.  Always.

                                ROMIREZ

                          Does it change with me in the room?

                                CONOR

                          It is less.

                                ROMIREZ

                          You feel you know me.

                                CONOR

                          I don't know why.

                                ROMIREZ

                          We are brothers.

42  EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT

    Romirez and Conor walk alone amongst torch-lit hutches.

                                CONOR

                          He told me there could be only

                          one.

                                ROMIREZ

                          Some cling to sanity through time

                          with the one continuity and trad0

                          ition their lives have known: The

                          Game.

                               (Conor confused)

                          You and I Conor, we are different

                          from all others around us.  You

                          know this, you can feel it.  We are

                          flesh and bone like any man, but

                          unlike our neighbors we are rather

                          difficult to injure,

                               (looks away)

                          permanently.

                                CONOR

                          I don't understand.

                                ROMIREZ

                          You are still so very young.

                                CONOR

                          I'm twenty-two.

                                ROMIREZ

                              (shakes head)

                          Not even a single lifetime.

    Romirez chooses his words very carefully.

                                ROMIREZ

                          Conor, you and I, we cannot be

                          killed.

                                CONOR

                          What?

                                ROMIREZ

                          We are immortal.

    Stunned, Conor backs away from Romirez.

                                CONOR

                          No, that can't be.

    Romirez grasps Conor's shoulder.

                                ROMIREZ

                          It is as you are.

                                CONOR

                             (pushes away)

                          No!

    This is all too much for Conor.

                                ROMIREZ

                          Listen to me.  Hear the words.

                                CONOR

                          This is madness!

                                ROMIREZ

                          It is the truth.

                                CONOR

                          No!

    Romirez suddenly draws his sword and thrusts it into Conor's

    heart.  The boy's mouth drops open in shocked terror as his

    eyes roll up into his head.

    A shudder, then Conor slides off the blade and crashes to the

    ground.

     Suddenly he sits up.  Sweating.  He looks about the room in

     confusion as Romirez enters with a plate of food.

                          a father and son look more alike.

                                TAUPIN

                          We were very close.

                                MR. NORTH

                          The resemblance is amazing.

                                TAUPIN

                          When may I expect the cleaners?

                                MR. NORTH

                          I'll send them right up.

49  INT. "O'REILY'S" - NIGHT                                        49

    Coupled strangers gyrate under colored lights and recorded music.

    Brenna sits alone.  Whatever nervousness she brought through the

    door with her has been turned into a comfortable cynicism by

    the three empty glasses in front of her.

    A MAN

    With something less than perfect coordination, sits down beside

    her.

                                MAN

                          That stuff'll put you away if

                          you're not careful.

                                BRENNA

                          There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He

                          would invite the local peasants to

                          his chateau, fill them full of wine,

                          then slice their bellies so he

                          could reuse it.

                                (smiles)

                          The symmetry of that somehow always

                          appealed to me.

                                MAN

                          You're very macabre.

                                BRENNA

                          It's my birthday.

                                MAN

                          Happy birthday.

                                BRENNA

                          Thanks.

    Brenna drains her glass and sets it down with a sigh.

                                BRENNA

                          Buy a birthday girl a drink?

50  INT. PUB - NIGHT                                                50

    A small neighborhood tavern.  Regulars chat amicably with the

    BARTENDER-OWNER.

    TAUPIN

    Sits alone at a corner table.  A WAITRESS hovers over him.

                                TAUPIN

                          Lager and lime.

    LATER

    Taupin's lager is drained.  Lost in thought, he drags a finger

    around and around the lip of the mug.

    He hand stops.  It twitches.  Shakes.

    Taupin pulls his hand from the glass and watches it shake slightly

    out of control.  A warning.

    He WHIRLS around suddenly to see LING KAHN, Asian, standing

    over him.

                                KAHN

                          MacLeod.

    Taupin is anxious, poised for attack.

    Kahn breaks into a broad smile.

                                KAHN

                          Spare a chair?

                                TAUPIN

                          Kahn?

                                KAHN

                          Are you going to offer me a chair

                          or leave me standing here all night?

                                TAUPIN

                          Sit.

    Kahn takes his place across the table.

                                TAUPIN

                               (unsure)

                          How are you?

                                KAHN

                          Head still secure to the neck.

                                TAUPIN

                          How did you find me?

                                KAHN

                          How many places this side of the

                          Atlantic serve lager and lime?

    Taupin looks to his own glass.

                                KAHN

                          Old habits die hard.

                              (to waitress)

                          Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic!

                                 (beat)

                          Peasant drool, I know.  But it's the

                          closest thing they stock to my side

                          of the fence.

                                TAUPIN

                          What are you doing here?

                                KAHN

                          It is the gathering, my friend.  The

                          settling of old scores.

    Taupin tenses.

                                TAUPIN

                          And have you something to settle

                          with me?

                                KAHN

                               (smiles)

                          Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink

                          with an old friend.

                                TAUPIN

                          It's good to see you, Kahn.

    The waitress sets down two glasses.

                                KAHN

                          Come, toast with me the past.

                              (raises glass)

                          To old conquests, old loves, and to a

                          time when we cared about either.

    Kahn drains his glass.

                                KAHN

                          Waitress!

51  EXT. THE WASHINGTON MALL - NIGHT                                51

    Kahn and Taupin sit drunkedly on the marble steps of a closed

    government building.

                                KAHN

                          I'll never forget the look on that

                          Papal commander's face when his

                          "heretic stronghold" turned out to

                          be a rock full of whores climbing

                          all over Neuvich.

                                TAUPIN

                          Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.

                                KAHN

                          But then rides up Pope Pius who

                          calmly brushes the dust from his

                          papal cross, climbs off his papal

                          horse, draws his papal sword and

                          asks just what the hell is going

                          on.  And what did Neuvich, dear

                          dear drunken Neuvich do?

                                TAUPIN

                          Offered the Pope one of his whores.

    They LAUGH.

    A JOGGER stops on the gravel and listens to the strange conversation.

                                TAUPIN

                          Had a great swing with his blade.

                          For a Pope.

                                KAHN

                                (sighs)

                          Good times then.  A man could

                          stretch his legs without bring-

                          ing half the world down around

                          his ears.  Not like now.

    The jogger shakes his head and runs on.

                                TAUPIN

                               (serious)

                          He found us even there.

                                KAHN

                          He always did.

52  EXT. ZOO - NIGHT                                                52

    A CLINKING of chain link as Taupin and Kahn climb a fence and

    tumble into the Washington Zoo.

                                TAUPIN

                          I haven't drunk this much since-

                                KAHN

                          -Since you last saw me.

    Kahn chucks an empty wine bottle.  An unspecified animal GROWLS

    sleepily somewhere in the darkness.

                                KAHN

                          Come on.

53  EXT. DISPLAY AREA - NIGHT                                       53

    Taupin and Kahn stumble through an open-air display of Asian

    animals.  Their VOICES seem to echo everywhere.

                                KAHN

                          I love zoos.  Ever since I was

                          a kid.

                                TAUPIN

                          You were never a kid.

    Kahn leans on the wall of a water buffalo pen.

                                KAHN

                             (points at one)

                          I knew his great-grandfather.

                                TAUPIN

                          You're insane.

                                KAHN

                          No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool

                          together in Rangoon.

                                TAUPIN

                          How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you

                          live so full of life for so long?

                                KAHN

                          Tasting and enjoying life is the

                          only thing of value we have.  All

                          else is just marking time.

                               (beat)

                          You're marking time.

                                TAUPIN

                          I've had a few more concerns.

    Kahn jams his hands into his overcoat and starts down the footpath.

                                KAHN

                          The pressure only comes when you

                          let the taste slip into your mouth.

                                TAUPIN

                          You're wrong.

                                KAHN

                          You don't run as hard, MacLeod.

                          You just don't run as hard anymore.

54  INT. O'REILY'S - NIGHT                                          54

    Late.  The bar is nearly empty.

    No sign of the Knight.  Brenna looks at her watch, sighs, and

    drops a bill onto the counter.

55  EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                             55

    Brenna has left the bar and is now walking down a dimly lit

    street.

    She hears something and turns.

    -Nothing.  A breeze rustles the trees above.

    After only a few more paces she hears something again.

    Brenna abruptly turns.

    -Right into the face of THE KNIGHT.

    Brenna SCREAMS.  The Knight reaches into his leather carrying bag.

    A GROUP OF NOISY TEENAGERS

    Exit a facing townhouse.  The Knight removes his hand from the

    bag as they spill onto the sidewalk LAUGHING and YELLING.

    Brenna moves close to the group as they walk to the corner.

    The Knight follows at a measured distance.

    At the corner the teenagers climb into a pickup and drive off.

    Brenna bolts into the intersection.  Weaving through SCREECHING

    brakes, she disappears into a pair of lighted glass doors.

56  INT. BUILDING                                                   56

    40 well dressed PATRONS, numbered cards pinned to their lapels,

    sit in velvetly plush surroundings.  At the front of the room

    stands a thin moustached art AUCTIONEER.

    Brenna BUSTLES in from outside.

                                AUCTIONEER

                          I apoligize for the lateness of the

                          hour, but I'm sure you will all agree

                          the quality of this year's collection

                          is well worth the time.

    The Knight BURSTS in with his leather carrying bag.  Brenna

    slides along the draped back wall to avoid him.

                                AUCTIONEER

                             (holding statuette)

                          For this fine example of medieval

                          religious art, let us open the bid

                          at 4,000 dollars.

    The Knight closes in on Brenna casually, without hurry.

                                AUCTIONEER

                          10,500 once, 10,500 twice...

    Brenna raises her arm to attract the attention of a SECURITY

    GUARD..

                                AUCTIONEER

                             (points at Brenna)

                          11,000.  A bid at 11,000.

                                BRENNA

                          No, I-

    The guard notices she has no lapel number and starts for her

    very officially.

    Being closed in on from both sides, Brenna suddenly runs across

    the room to a fire exit, setting off an ALARM as she flies open

    the door.

    The Knight leaps after her, knocking over an OLD WOMAN in the

    front row.

57  EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT                                           57

    Brenna runs the sidewalk and disappears into a Metro station.

58  INT. METRO STATION                                              58

    Brenna runs down the platform and jumps into a subway car

    just as the doors shut.

    THE KNIGHT

    is also now on the platform but can only watch Brenna through

    a window as the train pulls away.

59  EXT. TAUPIN'S TOWNHOUSE - DAY                                   59

    Brenna KNOCKS at the front door.  No answer.

    She KNOCKS harder.  The unlatched door pushes open.

60  INT. TOWNHOUSE                                                  60

    Brenna stands in the doorway.

    Before her is a disaster.  Furniture has been smashed like

    matchsticks.  A desk drawer's contents lie strewn in piles on

    the floor.

    Brenna enters slowly.

                                BRENNA

                          Mr. Taupin?  I have to talk to

                          you.

    Nothing has been left unturned or unbroken.

    Brenna kneels and sifts through a pile of crumpled papers.

    She comes across an old black and white photograph.  Badly

    streaked and faded, it shows Taupin standing beside a farm-

    house.  Written in the corner is "Worstick, 1928".

    Brenna slips the photo into her pocket.  Standing, she turns

    smack into Taupin.

                                TAUPIN

                          Finished?

    He looks past her to the destruction of his living room.  It

    doesn't seem to surprise him.

                                BRENNA

                          He tried to kill me last night.

                                TAUPIN

                          Where?

                                BRENNA

                          Dupont Circle.

    Taupin sifts through the debris, selecting articles from it.

                                BRENNA

                          Who is he?

                                TAUPIN

                          At the moment?  Carl Smith.

                                BRENNA

                          And you?

    He ignores the question.

                                BRENNA

                          What will you do now?

                                TAUPIN

                          You needn't worry Miss Cartwright.

                          I've been at this a very long time.

                                BRENNA

                          He called you "MacLeod".

                                TAUPIN

                          Not your concern.

                                BRENNA

                          I left a man dead in

                          Felton.  But you don't

                          really care, do you?

                                TAUPIN

                          That bothers you?

                                BRENNA

                          He was innocent.

                                TAUPIN

                          He's dead.  Whatever I may

                          or may not feel means

                          exceedingly little to him

                          now.

                                BRENNA

                          What about me?

                                TAUPIN

                          You?

                                BRENNA

                          I'm a witness to a murder.  That

                          seems to put me pretty high

                          on your friend's chop list.

                                TAUPIN

                          Have you gone to the

                          police?

                                BRENNA

                          No.

                                TAUPIN

                          Why not?  I'm sure they'd

                          love to hear your story.

                                BRENNA

                          I'd rather hear yours.

                                TAUPIN

                                (beat)

                          You are being foolish.

                                BRENNA

                          I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin.

                          Only once in a lifetime do you

                          stare history in the face.

                                TAUPIN

                          Go home.

    He walks to the doorway.

                                BRENNA

                          Why does he want to kill you?

    Taupin stops, his back to her.

                                TAUPIN

                          He sees me as a threat.

                                BRENNA

                          Are you?

    Taupin walks out the door.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

61  EXT. GRASSY KNOLL - DAY                                         61

    On a clear rise above the village Romirez and Conor spar with

    swords covered in heavy cloth.  Conor is having difficulty.

                                ROMIREZ

                          Concentrate!

    Conor thrusts.  Romirez blocks.

                                ROMIREZ

                          Harder.  Concentrate harder.

                                CONOR

                          Me arm hurts.

                                ROMIREZ

                          Again.  Try again.

    Conor strikes.  Romirez easily blocks.

                                ROMIREZ

                          Harder!  You swing like an impotent

                          cow!

                                CONOR

                          Go to hell.

                                ROMIREZ

                          Oh, the boy has a mouth,

                          now if only he had an arm.

    Ticked off, Conor leans himself into a two-fisted swing.

    Romirez knocks it aside, but Conor recovers faster than he,

    knocking Romirez flat on his back.

                                CONOR

                          Impotent cow.

                                ROMIREZ

                          Muy Bien!

    Conor drops the sword and wipes the sweat from his face.

    Romirez pours wine from a leather bag into a goblet pulled

    from his belt.  He offers it to Conor.

                                ROMIREZ

                          Here my boy, from vineyards

                          as sweet and smooth as a young

                          girl's thigh.

    Conor accepts the cup.  Romirez pulls himself to his feet.

                                ROMIREZ

                          It will take less effort

                          as you learn.

                                CONOR

                          It's like to kill me first.

    Romirez puts his arm around Conor and refills his cup.

                                ROMIREZ

                          You have a gift.  One you

                          must protect.

                                CONOR

                          And what is this great

                          gift that cannot be seen

                          or smelt?

                                ROMIREZ

                          The Fabric of life.  The spark

                          that allows the passing of

                          existence from one generation

                          to another.

                                CONOR

                              (shakes head)

                          If that was meant to be an ex-

                          planation Mr. Romirez from Spain,

                          I'm afraid you've failed.

    Romirez put his arm around Conor and leads him away.

                                ROMIREZ

                          Come.  Enough sword play for an

                          afternoon.

62  EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY                                          62

    A friendly horse race.  Their reflections bouncing off a clear

    glen, Conor and Romirez dodge moss-laiden ruts and leap fallen

    tree trunks.

    Beaming, Conor pushes through a last turn and stops to wait

    for Romirez, several lengths behind.

                                CONOR

                           (as Romirez rides up)

                          You're no match for Scot, Mr.

                          Romirez.  We're raised as riders.

                                ROMIREZ

                          Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod.

    Both their eyes turn to the beauty in view.  Romirez pulls a

    leaf from a tree and studies it closely.

                                CONOR

                          What is the fascinatioon?  It is only

                          a leaf.

                                ROMIREZ

                          All living things pay dues,

                          Conor.  They must be respected

                          for that.

    He pulls the leaf's points from the stalk, one by one.

                                ROMIREZ

                          As they age they contribute to a

                          sum that is the kindling from which

                          all future life comes.  To feel it,

                          to know it, is to be in touch with

                          the will of every living thing.

                                CONOR

                          I do not think I like the sound

                          of that.

                                ROMIREZ

                          It does not feel nearly as frightening

                          as it sounds.  But the consequences of

                          such feelings can be very frightening.

                          For it gives you great strength.  The

                          strength of _knowledge_.  The ability

                          to stand between the giving of what

                          has always been to what will always

                          be.

                                CONOR

                          I feel hardly nothing.

                                ROMIREZ

                          You have not been fully trained.

                          But you will learn.  And you will be

                          good, I can feel that.  You have apt-

                          itude.  This is why our friend is

                          so concerned.

                                CONOR

                          But why be so concerned about me?

                                ROMIREZ

                          This power is divided amongst you,

                          me, and others like cuts in a pie.

                          But the cuts are not equal.  Some,

                          like you and he, have more.  Much

                          more.

                                CONOR

                          And you?

                                ROMIREZ

                          I am a small player.  But if by

                          helping you I can keep that monster

                          from being the last, then perhaps

                          my life has meant something.

                                CONOR

                          I am not ready for this.

                                ROMIREZ

                          You must be.  You have responsibilities.

                          You must learn the rules.  You can never

                          attract attention to yourself, never

                          show the side that will draw others to

                          you.  You will always know when you are

                          in the presence of another.  Beware.

                          But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will

                          be your battle against time.  In the

                          coming years you will see kingdoms rise

                          then rot like wheat.  People will

                          become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The

                          only constant you will know will be

                          the others and the tradition their

                          greed and quest represent.  But life

                          without morality, without the ability

                          to truly taste the sweetness of wine

                          and love, is no life at all.  That is

                          how the others exist.  Nothing more

                          than walking corpses living only to

                          slaughter each other in an insane quest

                          to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed

                          to the earth.  Do not become one of them.

                                CONOR

                          Of course.

                                ROMIREZ

                          You are young, inexperienced.  You

                          do not know what time can do.  How

                          it can sap all pity, all love.

                                CONOR

                          That is not me.

                                ROMIREZ

                          With the proper tools, Conor, a

                          naive man can be much more dangerous

                          than an evil one.

                                VILLAGER

                          Conor!

    A VILLAGER approaches from across the pasture.

                                CONOR

                          Yes, Darin.

                                VILLAGER

                          Hate to be bothering you like this,

                          but me mare threw a shoe.

    Conor looks to Romirez.

                                ROMIREZ

                          Go ahead, Senor.

                              (gestures to wine)

                          I have my friend to keep me company.

                                CONOR

                          I'll be back when I can.

    Conor sets off across the pasture.

    Romirez enters and flops onto a cot.

    Settling down for a nap, he sets his sword beneath the bed

    and closes his eyes to the distant sound of CHILDREN playing.

    The room is still.

    Romirez begins to drowse.

    Suddenly his eyes leap open with full alertness.

    His hand moves under the cot.

    With an EXPLOSION the front door is lifted from its hinges

    and splintered into fragments.  Passing through a cloud of

    sawdust enters the Knight.  Without pause he topples a kitchen

    shelf onto a supine Romirez.

                                KNIGHT

                          Romirez.  What a surprise.

    Romirez is struggling under the debris.

    The Knight thrusts hard onto an exposed leg.

    The limb is severed.

                                ROMIREZ

                          Madonna!

    The Knight begins casting aside the shelving.

    With lightning speed Romirez pulls the sword from beneath the

    bed and hammers it deep into the Knight's side.

                                KNIGHT

                          Bastard!

    He crashes back against the wall.

    Romirez tries to lift himself from the bed using his sword

    as a crutch.

    The Knight has regained a meager balance on his knees.

    Blood pours from the slice in his stomach,

    Romirez pushes himself across the bed, plants his sword into

    the floor and hobbles a few paces before collapsing.

                                ROMIREZ

                          Oh, Santa Maria!

    The Knight crawls across the bed and drops to his knees

    beside Romirez.

                                KNIGHT

                          Why run?

                                ROMIREZ

                          Demonio!

    The Knight's trembling hands raise his shaking sword high.

                                KNIGHT

                          To hell with you.

65  EXT. BARNYARD - DAY                                             65

    Conor pounds at a horseshoe.

    The hammer slips from his grasp as he slumps forward as if

    pushed.

66  EXT. CONOR'S HOME - DAY                                         66

    Badly wounded, the Knight staggers through the shattered

    doorway and tumbles into the street.

    A CHILD SCREAMS.

    Pulling himself up, the Knight hobbles away.

67  EXT. - DAY                                                      67

    Conor is running through the village.

67  INT. CONOR'S HOME                                               67

    Conor rushes in and shudders to a stop.

    An entire wall is showered with blood.

    Conor walks slowly forward.  Dazed.

    As he looks down something takes his attention.

    It is Romirez's severed head.

    Conor moans in anguish and drops to his knees on the blood-

    stained floor.

    His head sinks to his chest as he begins sobbing.

    Somewhere in the bowels of the museum, the RESEARCH

    Brenna looms above him.

                          out of sight.  That on top of

                          the cops bugging him.

    The librarian looks her over skeptically.

                          Corey, you _owe_ me.

    Holding Brenna's photograph, the research librarian is comb-

    ing through stained binders.  The room is old, disorganized,

    and gives the impression that every fact worth knowing must

    be in it somewhere.

    The high backed office chair is spun away from an angry,

    entering Brenna.

                          We've got nothing to say.

    Moran presses the post on the phone.

                          What are you going to tell them?  That

                          played javelin with the cemetary

                          curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some

                          locals spotted two cars with D.C.

                          plates and surprise surprise, they

                          turn out to be registered to our

                          Naturally my feelings were crushed

                          when you didn't rush right over

                          and tell us what you knew.

                             (looks up)

                          ing the ambulence chaser as an

                          It'll never stick.

                                MORAN

                          But we might just give it the

                          'ole college try.  What with the

                          court back ups, it could be days

                          before you got an arraignment.

                          But then, I'm sure the flunk-out

                          neice of the D.A. knows all about

                          that.

                          You're an asshole, Moran.

                                MORAN

                          I want Taupin.

72  INT. CHURCH (WASHINGTON D.C.)                                   72

    A PRIEST celebrates mass in a present-day cathedral.

    In the rear of the church apart from the other PARISHIONERS

    sits the Knight.  As the priest leads the parishioners through

    the procession of faith, the Knight alone repeats it quietly

    to himself in Latin, the ancient language of the church.

73  EXT. ABANDONED GRAVEYARD - DAY                                  73

    Crooked tombstones strewn across the bleached ground of a place

    not beloning to reality.

    In full medieval tartan, Conor stands against a forceful wind.

    CRACKS

    Run the length plain, spewing forth steam and staggering

    SKELETONS.  There are dozens of them, all carrying their skulls

    under one arm.

    The skeletons press forward and trap Conor against the trunk

    of a dead oak.  The heads break into harsh, demonic LAUGHTER.

    Conor puts his hands over his ears in pain as the bodies push

    forward.

    SCREAMING, he disappears under a mass of gleaming bones.

                                                        CUT TO:

74  INT. TAUPIN'S WORSTICK HOME                                     74

    Taupin wakes from the dream with a SHOUT.

    He has fallen asleep in a desk chair.

    Taupin walks to a window and looks out to the green hills.  To

    the distance.

75  EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY                                           75

    Brenna's sedan shoots down a country highway.

76  INT. SEDAN - DAY                                                76

    Checking her rear view mirror, Brenna notices two suspicious

    FIGURES in a car behind her.

77  EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY                                           77

    Brenna pulls to the side.  The car from behind passes without

    incident.

78  INT. SEDAN - DAY                                                78

    Brenna is driving again.  Listening now to the RADIO, she

    casts a glance in the mirror.  The same car is behind her.

79  EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY                                           79

    Passing over a rise in the highway, Brenna turns abruptly

    onto a service road and behind a group of trees.

    THE OTHER CAR

    Pauses a moment at the intersection, then drives on.

80  EXT. STOREFRONT - DAY                                           80

    Brenna shows the PROPRIETOR the photograph.  He explains

    something to her.

    Brenna steps outside the store onto the Main Street of the

    very small community of Worstick.

    AT A STREET CORNER

    Brenna passes a small monument settled in a flower bed.  It has

    a plaque memorializing five locals murdered in 1931.

81  INT. SEDAN                                                      81

    A mile out of town Brenna stops at a farmhouse.  She checks

    it against the photo she found at Taupin's townhouse.  They

    match.

82  EXT. FARMHOUSE DOOR - DAY                                       82

    Brenna KNOCKS.

                                TAUPIN

                          You shouldn't have come.

    Brenna whirls around and sees Taupin behind her.

                                TAUPIN

                          We're you followed?

    He looks to the road.

                                BRENNA

                          No.

                                TAUPIN

                          No one knows you're here?

                                BRENNA

                          No.  I had to talk to you.

                                TAUPIN

                          You had to do _nothing_!

                                BRENNA

                          You're wrong.

                                TAUPIN

                          You're a fool.

                                BRENNA

                          Maybe.

    Pause.  Taupin strides through the doorway.

                                TAUPIN

                          Come inside.

83  INT. FARMHOUSE                                                  83

    Brenna and Taupin enter.  A heavy broad sword sits on the

    coffee table.

                                BRENNA

                          Is this what you killed them with?

                                TAUPIN

                          You've been listening to rumors.

                                BRENNA

                          Our cars were seen together in

                          Felton.  They're calling me an

                          accessory to murder.

                                TAUPIN

                          You are.  Now.

    Beat.  They're stuck with each other.

                                TAUPIN

                          There's several bedrooms down the

                          hall.  Take your pick.

84  INT. BEDROOM                                                    84

    The room is a strange decor.  18th century paintings hang

    beside grotesque medieval carvings.

    Brenna's face softens with worry.  What is she doing?

85  EXT. RURAL PAY PHONE - DAY                                      85

    A plain-clothed POLICE OFFICER is in mid conversation.

                                OFFICER

                          No, that's the last place we saw

                          her.  Okay, will do.

    He hangs up.

                                PARTNER

                          Well?

                                OFFICER

                                (shrugs)

                          We keep looking.

                                PARTNER

                          Wonderful.

86  INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY                                            86

    Taupin sits at his desk.  Before him is spread out blank birth

    certificates, driver licenses and title deeds.  His eyes lift

    to the corridor where Brenna is.  An idea has come to him.

    Brenna enters.

                                BRENNA

                          What's all that?

                                TAUPIN

                          Richard Taupin has become

                          cumbersome.  It would be best

                          if he just disappeared.

    Brenna walks to the window.

                                BRENNA

                          You did kill those men.

                                TAUPIN

                          Not all of them.

                                BRENNA

                          When you finish, what then?

                                TAUPIN

                          I go my way and you can write

                          all you want about the big bad

                          Mr. Taupin.

                                BRENNA

                          You make it all sound so simple.

                                TAUPIN

                          The only real difficulty comes

                          in changing over the ownership

                          of property I've aquired.  That

                          requires certain records and

                          most importantly a personal

                          appearance at the county seat in

                          Gettysburg.  But that's where

                          you come in.

                                BRENNA

                          You want me to front for you.

                                TAUPIN

                          The less exposure I recieve

                          around government buildings the

                          better.  You, as Mrs. Taupin,

                          will attract considerably less

                          attention than I.

    Brenna is unsure.

                                TAUPIN

                          Not such a bad trade.  The story

                          of a lifetime for a few days

                          work?

87  INT. TAUPIN'S WASHINGTON TOWNHOUSE                              87

    Detective Moran looks through the broken remains of the living

    room.

    An INSPECTOR enters.

                                INSPECTOR

                          They lost her outside of Thurmont.

    Moran sighs and tosses a piece of wood on the pile of debris.

                                MORAN

                          I want people in here to check

                          over every piece of this stuff.

                                INSPECTOR

                          Figure she's with him?

                                MORAN

                          Yeah.

                                INSPECTOR

                          We ran down that Church Hill info.

                          She's right.  There is no Richard

                          Taupin.

                                MORAN

                          Any other I.D.s come up?

                                INSPECTOR

                          Not yet.  Called FBI yesterday.

                          Thompson's going to try CIA

                          this afternoon.

                                 (shrugs)

                          Y'never know.

    Moran rises and dons his coat.

                                MORAN

                          Should have seen him the first

                          night.  Son of a bitch stood there

                          with a quart of blood on his

                          pant leg and didn't even blink.

                                INSPECTOR

                          You'd think he'd had practice.

    Moran walks to the door.

                                MORAN

                          I think he has.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

88  EXT. FRENCE MILITARY CAMP - DAY                                 88

    Conor, now MAJOR DUPONT of the French infantry, pours over

    battle plans.

    An AIDE, dressed as Conor-Dupont in 18th century European

    military garb, enters the command area.

                                AIDE

                          The men are assembled, Major.

    A GENERAL stands beside the major.

                                GENERAL

                          See that they are indeed ready,

                          Dupont.

                                DUPONT (CONOR)

                          Yes General.

89  EXT. PARADE GROUND - DAY                                        89

    A regiment of INFANTRYMEN, pale blue coat tails tossing in

    the light breeze, stand at attention.

    A STAFF SARGEANT presents the men to Dupont.

                                STAFF SARGEANT

                          Regiment ready for review, sir.

    Dupont walks past the sargeant to the line.

                                DUPONT

                              (to soldier)

                          Stand straight, you are a soldier

                          of the King.

                                SOLDIER #1

                          Yes sir.

    Dupont continues down the line.  Another soldier's infantry

    jacket is almost hilariously mis-buttoned, one collar sticking

    up four inches higher than the other.

    Dupont with both hands rips open the soldier's coat, spraying

    brass buttons onto the ground.

    He moves on.

                                DUPONT

                              (to soldier)

                          Where is your bayonet?

                                SOLIDER #3

                          Lost it sir.

                                DUPONT

                          Where?

    The soldier hedges.

                                STAFF SARGEANT

                          You heard the Major!  Where!

                                SOLDIER #3

                          Whorehouse sir.

    Dupont's face softens in exasperation, then toughens.

                                DUPONT

                          Your rifle.  Hand it to me.

    The soldier obeys.  Dupont inspects the firing mechanism.

                                DUPONT

                          The flint is cracked.  No spark

                          will reach your powder.  You will

                          die tomorrow.

    He throws the rifle roughly back into the soldier's hands.

                                DUPONT

                          Tomorrow you go to _battle_!  And

                          you look like children!

                                (beat)

                          The General has charged me with

                          seeing that you are prepared, and

                          prepared you will be!  If necessary

                          you stand here all night!  Sargeant!

    The sargeant leaps to attention.

                                SARGEANT

                          Yes sir.

                                DUPONT

                          See to it.

                                SARGEANT

                          Yes sir.

    Dupont turns briskly, then stops abruptly as if alerted by some-

    thing.  He whirls around and faces the young infantrymen.

    His expression is quizzical as he walks the line, checking

    each face carefully.

    One PRIVATE seizes his attention.  The private is cautious.

                                DUPONT

                          Your name?

                                MULET

                          Mulet.

    It is as if Dupont knows him.  The two stare at each other.

    Dupont turns and leaves.

90  INT. COTTAGE - EVENING                                          90

    Inside a small farmhouse commandeered for officer's quarters,

    Dupont (Conor) and several others eat their evening meal.

    A CAPTAIN finishes his story.

                                CAPTAIN

                                (amused)

                          ...And what a sight!  That old

                          mare just kept falling over her

                          own guts till someone finally

                          shot her.

    The OFFICERS LAUGH.  All but Dupont.

                                MAJOR

                              (beside Dupont)

                          Complete your inspection?

                                DUPONT

                          They're nothing but boys.  It

                          will be a slaughter tomorrow.

                                MAJOR

                                (laughs)

                          I doubt much can change that.

                          The enemy has five brigades

                          waiting for us.

                                DUPONT

                          We need more time.

                                MAJOR

                          Won't get it.

                               (shrugs)

                          We are a sacrifice.  A diversion.

    Dupont pokes unenthusiastically at his plate.

                                MAJOR

                          Eat up Dupont.  It will probably

                          be your last.

                                DUPONT

                                (rises)

                          Not likely.

    Dupont goes to the window.  Dusk shines orange on his face.

    In the foreground the man Dupont encountered at the line-up,

    Mulet, is chopping firewood.

91  EXT. COTTAGE - NIGHT                                            91

    Several hours later.

    Most are asleep.  Mulet continues his wood splitting.

    From out of the dark cottage steps Dupont.

                                DUPONT (CONOR)

                          I thought I gave orders the

                          regiment was to drill.

                                MULET

                          Staff sargeant detailed me to

                          prepare firewood for the break-

                          fast cooking.

                                DUPONT

                          What is your position?

                                MULET

                          Second musketeer.

                                DUPONT

                          I understand you joined up in

                          Bremen.

                                MULET

                          You seem to understand a great

                          deal.

                                DUPONT

                          I am a Major, Private.  You would

                          do well remembering that when

                          addressing me.

                                MULET

                          Excuse me, "sir".  I thought we

                          spoke as equals.

                                DUPONT

                          Equals?

                                MULET

                               (shrugs)

                          If you wish to play games, Major.

    Mulet returns to his chore.

                                DUPONT

                          Wait.  I think we understand each

                          other.

                                MULET

                          We have no understanding.

                                DUPONT

                          Then it is time two of us did.

                          You are very young.  I was once

                          young.  I can help.

    Mulet LAUGHS.

                                MULET

                          Help?  I've seen others "help".

                          Somehow a head always ended up

                          on the counter.

                                DUPONT

                          It can be different.  It must be.

                                MULET

                          It never changes, Major.

    Mulet turns to his chore.  Dupont grabs his arm.

                                DUPONT

                          We must talk.

                                MULET

                             (shakes him off)

                          Stay out of it.

                                DUPONT

                                (angry)

                          Don't threaten me, Private.

                                MULET

                                (disgust)

                          Who do you think I am?  One of your

                          freckle faced children waiting to

                          die tomorrow?  "Threaten you"?  You

                          and I just living will always be a

                          threat.  Forever.  Look at your life,

                          Major.  Look at mine.  Nothing there

                          but threat.  Threats and nothingness.

                          It's what we live for.

    Mulet turns his back on Dupont.

    Dupont draws his cutlass.

                                DUPONT

                          Do not turn your back on me.

                                MULET

                          You are really going to force this,

                          aren't you?

                                DUPONT

                          Either you are with me or against me.

    Mulet turns slowly, axe in hand.

                                MULET

                          Have I a choice?

    The two stare into eyes empty of emotion.

    Mulet's hand flinches.  An attack?

    Dupont CUTS quickly, slicing open both of Mulet's arms.

    The axe drops to the ground.

    Mulet seems strangely calm.

                                MULET

                          You see Major?  You are not so

                          different.

    Dupont cuts off Mulet's head where he stands.

92  EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT                                           92

    Dupont drags the corpse across the meadow and dumps it into

    a swamp.

93  INT. CATHEDRAL - NIGHT                                          93

    It is very late.  Only a few OFFICERS are seated in the pews.

    Dupont tries to concentrate on prayer, but is distracted.

                                MULET

                             (voice flashback)

                          You see Major?  You are not so

                          different...

                                DUPONT

                          I had no choice.

    Dupont sighs and looks to the altar.

                                DUPONT

                          Who am I deceiving?

                                KNIGHT

                          Certainly not me.

    Dupont whirls around to see the Knight, dressed as he in uniform,

    sitting one row behind.

    Dupont leaps to his feet.

                                KNIGHT

                          You needn't look so flushed,

                          Major.  You are quite safe in

                          church.

    Dupont eases his breathing.

                                KNIGHT

                          State of grace and all that.

                                DUPONT

                          Tradition.

                                KNIGHT

                          It's all we have.

    Dupont has backed up a few paces.

                                KNIGHT

                          All this time and still a scared

                          little boy.

    Dupont sits down.

                                DUPONT

                          Not so scared.

                                KNIGHT

                          Perhaps not.

                               (smiles)

                          You seem to have misplaced a

                          private.  No doubt by now his

                          head is stranger to his neck.

                                DUPONT

                          No doubt.

                                KNIGHT

                          You surprise me.  Eliminating a

                          rival like that.  Such are the

                          actions of a man of conquest.  I

                          was mistaken.  300 years have

                          turned the boy's fear into ambit-

                          ion.

                                DUPONT

                          You're wrong.

                                KNIGHT

                          I know you very well, Conor MacLeod.

                          And I can see the truth beginning

                          to make itself clear to you.  Mulet,

                          Romirez, they were fools without

                          vision.  It was destined that the

                          board would be cleared for the real

                          players.

    The Knight almost seems proud of Dupont.

                                DUPONT

                          Romirez understood.  Not you.

                                KNIGHT

                          Romirez is dust.

    The Knight looks to the altar.

                                KNIGHT

                          Finish your prayers?

                                DUPONT

                          Finish yours?

                                KNIGHT

                                (smiles)

                          Our common heritage.

                                (beat)

                          I am your only real friend, you

                          know.  The only one who truly

                          understands you.

                                (rises)

                          I look forward to the day we

                          meet again.  And I kill you.

                                DUPONT

                          So sure?

    The Knight leans forward and puts his face very near.

                                KNIGHT

                          You can't stay in church forever.

    The Knight moves into the aisle.

                                KNIGHT

                          Good night, Major.

    He exits.

    Conor sits in the dim church alone.  Very alone.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

94  EXT. WORSTICK CHURCH (PRESENT DAY)                              94

    Richard Taupin sits against the stone of an old Catholic church.

    Taupin sighs.  A long, weary sigh.

95  INT. TAUPIN'S FARMHOUSE                                         95

    Taupin and Brenna sit at a table working on forms.

    Taupin looks up from his work and studies Brenna's face without

    malice.

95  EXT. CREEK - DAY                                                95

    Brenna and Taupin are taking a walk along the township's

    outskirts.

    Crossing a small bridge over a smaller creek, they encounter

    the elderly caretaker Mr. North and his eight year old GRANDSON.

    Both with fishing poles.

                                MR. NORTH

                          Morning Mr. North

                                TAUPIN

                          Same.

                                MR. NORTH

                          Such a pretty day.  If I live

                          to be 90 I'll never tire of

                          mornings like this.  Mind you

                          I'm 74 now.

                                TAUPIN

                          No.

                                MR. NORTH

                          Yes sir.  When you get older your

                          priorities change.  It's the simple

                          things that count.  Without them

                          growing old can be a very lonely

                          thing.

                                TAUPIN

                          I'm sure that's true.

    The grandson is having difficulty baiting his line.  Taupin bends

    down beside the young fisherman.

                                TAUPIN

                              (takes worm)

                          Here.  The hook should go just below

                          the head, where the meat is toughest.

                                GRANDSON

                          Thanks.

    Taupin's show of affection surprises Brenna.

                                TAUPIN

                          Show you a trick.

    Taupin takes a clump of leaves from the bridge and winds them

                          Fish are creatures of habit.  They

                          like their food where they're used

                          to it.  At the top, hiding in old

                                TAUPIN

                          My father taught me.

                                GRANDSON

                          Your father must be smart.

                                TAUPIN

                          Yes, he was.

    Brenna is touched.

96  INT. TAUPIN'S FARMHOUSE - NIGHT                                 96

    Brenna lies on her bed thinking.  She puts on a robe and walks

    into the living room.

    LIVING ROOM

    Taupin sits before the fireplace, its flames reflecting on his

    brandy glass.  Brenna moves quietly to a seat beside him.

                                TAUPIN

                            (eyes on the fireplace)

                          There was a man once.  Just a simple

                          woodcarver.  But he understood.  More

                          than anyone he could see to the heart

                          of it.

                                (beat)

                          It never ends.  Today is the same as

                          the first.  Tomorrow will be the

                          same as today.  So much time.  And all

                          of it wasted.

                                (beat)

                          You love history?

                                BRENNA

                          Yes.

                                TAUPIN

                          I wish I could.

    Brenna looks through a property zoning book.

98  EXT. WORSTICK MAIN STREET - DAY                                 98

    Walking past small town stores, Brenna allows herself a moment

    to window shop.

    IN A SHOP WINDOW

    Is a small poster advertising a community get-together.  Brenna

    peels it off the glass and slips it into her notebook.

99  INT. TAUPIN'S FARMHOUSE                                         99

    Brenna and Taupin go over various forms and documents.

                                BRENNA

                          The estate stuff is pretty straight

                          forward.  Just lots of forms and an

                          appearance at the county seat.

                                TAUPIN

                          It will take some time for the

                          forms to clear before you go to

                          Gettysburg.

    Brenna is silent.

                                TAUPIN

                          Second thoughts?

    Pause.

                                BRENNA

                          No.

                                (beat)

                          So what now?  We just wait?

                                TAUPIN

                          Yes.

                                BRENNA

                          Well, as long as we're stuck here.

    She hands him the poster from earlier.

                                BRENNA

                          It's some sort of party the

                          town is throwing.

                                TAUPIN

                          They do it each year.

                                BRENNA

                          I thought it might be a nice break

                          from all of this.

    Taupin stacks the documents into a folder.

                                TAUPIN

                          Maybe it would do us both good.

                                BRENNA

                          There's a catch.  You're supposed

                          to wear 19th century clothing.

100  INT. FARMHOUSE CELLAR                                         100

     Taupin is going through an old trunk.

                                TAUPIN

                          My father was something of a

                          junk collector.

     He comes across a long period dress and offers it to Brenna.

                                TAUPIN

                          Here, try this.  I suppose they're

                          still making women the same as back

                          then.

                                BRENNA

                          It's beautiful.

                                TAUPIN

                          A little dusty.

     Taupin fishes through the trunk and comes up with an old top

     hat.  He turns it over in his hand with stoic memory.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

101  EXT. COLONIAL STYLE HOME - DUSK                               101

     Conor and a beautiful young woman, KATHERINE, sit on the porch

     steps in 1800s period dress.  Other young COUPLES relax nearby

     enjoying the warm summer's twilight.  Katherine's MOTHER shuffles

     between the couples offering lemonade, cakes, and the like.

                                KATHERINE

                          Do it again.

     She is thoroughly charmed by Conor.

                                CONOR

                          All right.

     Conor wraps a length of yarn about his fingers.  By turning his

     hand over and bending his knuckles just so, the web becomes the

     outline of a lion..

                                CONOR

                          A lion.

                                (growls)

     Katherine is delighted.

     Conor starts to remove the yarn.  Katherine touches his arm.

                                KATHERINE

                          Oh please.  Another one.

                                CONOR

                          What would you like?

                                KATHERINE

                          Something pretty.

                                CONOR

                          Like you.

     Conor cups his hands, bends his fingers, and comes up with a

     four leaf clover.

                                KATHERINE

                          That's wonderful.  Where did you

                          ever learn it?

                                CONOR

                          Far away.

                                KATHERINE

                          Kiss me.

     Conor shoots a glance for the mother, then kisses Katherine

     softly.

                                YOUNG MAN

                                (o.s.)

                          You'll be leaving the girl alone.

     A YOUNG MAN stands a few yards from the stairs.

                                KATHERINE

                          David.

                                CONOR

                          Do you have cause to bothering

                          us?

                                YOUNG MAN

                          That's my girl.

                                KATHERINE

                          David, we've already spoken of this.

                                YOUNG MAN

                          He's not what he pretends to be.

     Conor climbs to his feet.

                                CONOR

                          You best leave, son.

                                YOUNG MAN

                          You think you're so high and

                          mighty, coming into town and

                          taking a man's woman.  Well I

                          know about you.  I know about

                          the things you do.

                                CONOR

                             (moving closer)

                          I said you best leave.

                                YOUNG MAN

                          You'd like that, wouldn't you?

                              (to Katherine)

                          Ask him about his friends.  The

                          ones he meets in the town square.

                          Ask him about the blade he keeps

                          beneath his bed.

     Conor grabs the youth's collar and pulls him close.

                                CONOR

                             (like ice)

                          Leave.  While you still can.

     The youth pushes away from the grasp.

                                YOUNG MAN

                          You don't frighten me.

                                CONOR

                          I should.

     The young man throws a fist at Conor.  It is easily blocked.

     Conor returns with a savage blow to the chest that knocks

     the young man gasping onto the ground.

     Katherine runs up behind and grabs Conor's outstretched arm.

                                KATHERINE

                          No!  Leave him.  Please don't hurt him.

                          Please.

     COUGHING painfully, the youth climbs to his feet and staggers

     away.

                                YOUNG MAN

                          He's not what you think.

     He turns and runs down the road.

                                YOUNG MAN

                          He's not what you think!

     Katherine turns to Conor, his face still locked in ice.

                                KATHERINE

                          I don't care who you are or where

                          you come from.

     She hugs him tightly.

                                KATHERINE

                          I love you.

     Conor's face softens as he brings up an arm to hold her.

102  INT. WORSTICK TOWN HALL (PRESENT DAY)                         102

     An auditorium has been transformed with colored lights and

     strung paper into a small town party.

     TEENAGERS in period dress control the floor, dancing to a

     decidedly un-period ROCK BAND.

     The OLDER GUESTS are gathered around the punch bowl talking

     crops or Pennsylvania politics.

     BRENNA

     Fitted as well as can be expected in her lace dress, enters

     with Taupin, himself dressed in a formal suit complete with cape.

     His clothes fit perfectly.

     Mr. North, comically dressed as a pirate, greets them.

                                MR. NORTH

                          Mr. Taupin!  Glad you could make it.

                          Best get some punch before it's

                          gone.  Near the whole valley showed

                          up.

     They go to the table.

     Taupin pours a glass of punch.  An ELDERLY WOMAN approaches him.

                                WOMAN

                          If I didn't know better I'd say

                          William Taupin.

                                TAUPIN

                          His son.  Richard.

                                MR. NORTH

                          Mr. Taupin is up from Washington

                          to look over his father's estate.

                          Your father died some years ago.

                          This is your first visit?

     The tone is snide.

                                TAUPIN

                          Of sorts.

                                WOMAN

                          I suppose a Taupin had to show

                          up eventually.

                          Good evening, Mrs. Butler.

     She turns in surprise at his knowing her name, then walks on.

                          What was all that about?

                          Sorry Mr. Taupin.  That's not meant

                          for you.  Just some didn't take

                          much to your father.

                          My father was never one for social

                          Kept to himself for sure.  Then with

                          Family down the road from the

                          Taupin place was murdered.  All

                          cut up they were.  Horrible.  Two

                          strangers were also found with

                          the bodies.  No one ever accused

                          William, but with his reputation

                          as a loner and the rumors about

                          him and some of the wives in town,

                          folks just never forgot.  Most

                          were relieved when they heard he'd

                          died.  Sorry Mr. Taupin.

                                TAUPIN

                          Nothing to be sorry about.

                                MR. NORTH

                          Just your pappy scared some.

     The rock band finished as a PORTLY MAN in a union soldier's

     uniform takes the microphone.

                                PORTLY

                          All right, the kids have had their

                          fun.  Now it's time for a little

                          more traditional dancing.

     The rock band gives ground to a group of older MUSICIANS.  With

     a nod from the union soldier they begin a folk tune with fiddles

     and hammer dulcimer.

     The costumed guests take to the floor.

                                BRENNA

                          I don't know any of these.  I'll

                          make a fool of myself.

                                TAUPIN

                          Follow me.

     Taupin starts into it with perfect grace.  A faltering Brenna

     tries to keep up.

                                BRENNA

                          William Taupin seems to have left

                          his mark.

                                TAUPIN

                          Yes.

                                BRENNA

                          And you are William

                          Taupin, aren't you?

                                TAUPIN

                          Yes.

     They do a final turn and finish.  The other DANCERS applaud.

                                BRENNA

                          You're using your son's

                          name.

                                TAUPIN

                          No.  Just the child of

                          some lonely girl I gave

                          a ride to.  When they

                          died I put them in a

                          grave with my name on it.

                          Twenty years later I

                          became the son.

     Brenna is staring at him.

                                TAUPIN

                          More punch?

     He leads her to a table.

                                BRENNA

                          Then you must be at least

                          70 years old.

                                TAUPIN

                          At least.

                                BRENNA

                          That's impossible.

     Several of the ELDERLY WOMEN are watching Taupin from across

     the room.

103  EXT. BUS STATION - NIGHT                                      103

     A bus with "Gettysburg" across the front pulls to a stop at

     a dark terminal.  A lone passenger steps off into the mist.

     It is the Knight, bound up in a leather jacket and carrying

     only a long, narrow case.

104  EXT. - NIGHT                                                  104

     Brenna and Taupin walk alone in the night outside the hall.

                                BRENNA

                          It's frightening sometimes the

                          way you talk about other people's

                          lives.

                                TAUPIN

                          A factor of age.

                                BRENNA

                          I hope I never get that old.

                                TAUPIN

                          You won't.

     Brenna pulls away.

                                BRENNA

                          I must be insane.  Leaving work,

                          ditching cops.  All to follow a

                          murderer.  A very old murderer,

                          but a murderer just the same.

                                TAUPIN

                          Why are you here?

                                BRENNA

                          I've been telling myself it's the

                          award winning journal article I'm

                          going to write.  But it's not.

                              (looks at him squarely)

                          It's you.

                                TAUPIN

                          I see.

                                BRENNA

                          I'm not even sure why.

                                TAUPIN

                          Hardly a reason to run off with

                          a murderer.

                                BRENNA

                          My life has been chock full of

                          people with complications and weak-

                          nesses.  I can't stand it.  But

                          you're different.  It's in your

                          hands.  A clarity.

                                TAUPIN

                          You are a very perceptive young

                          woman.

                                BRENNA

                          Just a little crazy.

     A thoughtful pause.

                                TAUPIN

                          Miss Cartwright, it's time I

                          showed you something.

105  INT. FARMHOUSE CELLAR                                         105

     Taupin and Brenna descend the stairs to a seemingly flush wall.

     Taupin reaches behind a bookcase and pulls something.  A press

     from his hand and the wall becomes a doorway.

                                TAUPIN

                              (gestures to interior)

                          Miss Cartwright?

     Brenna steps uneasily into the darkness.  Taupin follows and

     switches on the light.

106  INT. HIDDEN ROOM                                              106

     Brenna's expression changes to awe.

     The room is massive, a cross between a museum and an old attic.

     Suits of armor, Italian statuettes, Czech ironworks, Persian

     fetishes and a thousand other oddities from a hundred eras

     crowd the shelving and floor space.

     The room has the look of ownership, as if civilization had

     taken the time to keep a scrapbook.

                                BRENNA

                          My God.

     The sight is overwhelming.

                                TAUPIN

                          I had this room built some

                          time ago.

     Brenna picks up a Carolingian tapestry and runs her hand along

     its intricate weaving.

                                BRENNA

                          Who are you?

                                TAUPIN

                          That would be difficult to explain.

                                BRENNA

                          I'd like you to try.

     Taupin picks up a Byzantine icon, brushing the dust from its

     shoulders.

                                TAUPIN

                          I was born Conor MacLeod in the

                          village of Ardvrek on the High-

                          land plain of Strathnaver in the

                          clan of MacLeod under the King

                          of Scotland.  On the eleventh of

                          December, 1408.

     He replaces the icon.

                                TAUPIN

                          I have served in the armies of

                          twelve nations, married nine

                          women, fathered thirty-eight

                          children and buried them all.

     Taupin walks along the cases.

                                TAUPIN

                          I carried that rifle in World

                          War I.  This book is a 16th Century

                          policy report for the King of

                          Austria.  The diploma is my con-

                          ference of degree in Latin from

                          Trinity College.  Class of 1672.

                                 (beat)

                          It goes on.

                                BRENNA

                          That's why Smith called you

                          MacLeod.

                                TAUPIN

                          Yes.

                                BRENNA

                          He knows about you.

                                TAUPIN

                          He is older than I.

                                BRENNA

                          What could possibly be worth all

                          this murder and distruction.

                                TAUPIN

                          Sometimes I think it's just for

                          something to do.  A conquest to

                          be the last.  Something to hold

                          onto while everything else around

                          you withers and blows away.  Some-

                          thing to replace the love that can

                          never work.

                                BRENNA

                          That's insane.

                                TAUPIN

                          Perhaps.  There is something more.

                          An inheritance.

                                BRENNA

                          Of bodies.

                                TAUPIN

                          I didn't kill the watchman.

                                BRENNA

                          You killed those other two.

                                TAUPIN

                          Not the same.

                                BRENNA

                          What about that family in '31?

                                TAUPIN

                          Sometimes innocents become involved.

                                BRENNA

                          You and your buddy make a real

                          team, don't you?  Exchanging

                          eloquent threats in iambic pen-

                          tameter while hacking up all

                          the innocents in between.

                                TAUPIN

                          There are differences.

                                BRENNA

                          You kill with your left hand?

                                TAUPIN

                          I haven't killed _you_.

                                BRENNA

                          Is that a threat?

     Taupin moves very close.

                                TAUPIN

                          No.

     Brenna's face softens.  She turns away.

                                BRENNA

                          Don't.

                                TAUPIN

                          Come here, Brenna.

                                BRENNA

                          Damn you.

     He kisses her.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

107  EXT. TURN OF THE CENTURY CEMETARY - DAY                       107

     RELATIVES in period dress watch as a family member is lowered

     into the ground.

     A very OLD WOMAN stands stoically, supported on both sides by

     her middle aged SONS.

                                MINISTER

                          May God commend into his kingdom

                          the soul of our dear departed

                          Jason, son of Katherine-

     The old woman.

                                MINISTER

                          And brother to Howard and James-

     The two middle aged sons.

     CONOR

     Watches the funeral quietly at a distance.

     THE OLD WOMAN

     As the minister continues allows her gaze to wander.  She sees

     Conor standing at the treeline.  Her eyes crinkle in disbelief.

     Releasing herself from her sons, she hobbles toward Conor.

     Confused, the brothers watch their mother leave the ceremony.

     CONOR

     Watches the woman approach but decides against moving.

     She stops a few paces away and looks over him.

                                OLD WOMAN

                          You.

                                CONOR

                          Katherine.

                                OLD WOMAN

                          What are you doing here?

                                CONOR

                          I owe him this.

                                OLD WOMAN

                          He never knew you.

     The two sons come up behind.  The three stand there: an old

     woman who could be 60 years Conor's senior and her two sons

     old enough to be his father.

                                SON #1

                          Is something wrong, Mother?

                                OLD WOMAN

                          Howard.  James.  This is your

                          father...

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

108  INT. BEDROOM                                                  108

     Taupin and Brenna lie together.

     Running her hands along the contours of his body she sees the

     countless faint scars of bullet and sword wounds.

     Taupin strokes her softly.

                                TAUPIN

                          "Brenna".  In Celtic is means

                          "woman with raven hair".  Only

                          chieftan's daughters were allowed

                          it.

     Brenna is lost in Taupin's scars.

                                BRENNA

                          What is it like?  Being you?

                                TAUPIN

                          Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that

                          would kill you and fear of those that

                          would love you.  It can never last, and

                          in the end you always end up destroying

                          both.

                                BRENNA

                          But you're known so much.

                          History I'll only read about.

                                TAUPIN

                          It's all the same.  Half lives that

                          never go away.

                                BRENNA

                          What is it you want?

                                TAUPIN

                          All of it finished.

109  EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING                                      109

     Taupin and Brenna stand beside her car.  She has an armload

     of documents.

                                TAUPIN

                          Gettysburg's an hour's drive

                          at most.  You should be back

                          by nightfall.

                                BRENNA

                          Will I see you again?

                                TAUPIN

                          Be careful.  Don't stay any

                          longer than you have to.

     Pause.  Brenna considers touching him but instead climbs briskly

     into the car.

                                TAUPIN

                          Good luck.

110  EXT. POLICE DEPARTMENT PARKING LOT - DAY                      110

     Detective Moran and his Inspector walk among parked squad cars.

                                MORAN

                          Are you sure?

                                INSPECTOR

                          Won't know till the

                          records department comes

                          back with it this after-

                          noon.  Looks good though.

                          They found the receipt

                          in his townhouse.  It was

                          pretty smeared but had

                          Taupin's father listed

                          as a signatory.

                                MORAN

                          Round up who you can

                          and put them on standby.

                                INSPECTOR

                          Think we should call the

                          local P.D. out there

                          first?

                                MORAN

                          No.  I want this to be

                          all ours.

111  INT. COUNTY RECORDS OFFICE                                    111

     Brenna is standing at a counter signing the last of a stack.

                                CLERK

                          O.K. Mrs. Taupin, that's

                          all I need.

     The clerk fills out a small sheet and hands it to her.

                                CLERK

                          Just take this down

                          the hall to the regis-

                          trar.  Hurry up though,

                          it's near closing time.

                          Most everyone's gone

                          home already.

     A pair of Levis follow Brenna at a distance down the corridor.

112  INT. REGISTRAR'S OFFICE                                       112

     Sealed from the corridor by a pair of doors, two CLERKS

     sit in an office mostly cleared of employees.

     Brenna hands the slip to a clerk.

                                CLERK #2

                          I'll be right back.

     She disappears into the rear area.

                                BRENNA

                             (to other clerk)

                          Do you have a drinking

                          fountain?

                                CLERK #3

                          Around the corner.

     Brenna steps around and takes a drink.  She looks into her

     reflection on the stainless steel and spends a moment fiddling

     with her hair.

     THE CLERK

     Still hasn't returned.  Brenna drums her fingers on the

     counter top and looks around the office.

     The second clerk is also gone.

     Brenna sees something unfamiliar on the second clerk's desk.

     She steps over to it.

     It is a large blood stain.

     Brenna shoots a glance to the double doors.

     They're closed.

     Brenna rushes to the doors.  Someone's locked them.

     She struggles with the handles, then turns to see the Knight

     walking to her with his stained sword.

     With a SCREAM she kicks a rolling office chair into him and

     runs down an opposite corridor.

     THE KNIGHT

     Flings the chair aside and knocks open the door with a SLAM

     of his palm.

     BRENNA

     Has run out of corridor.  She looks back at the Knight closing

     the distance.  CRYING in fear, she frantically searches for

     a way out.

     The Knight is nearly upon her.

     In desperation she runs into a janitorial closet, closing

     its heavy door.

     THE CLOSET

     Is dark and full of old paint cans and mops.  Her BREATHING

     is at a PANIC.

     THE KNIGHT

     Tries the door handle.

     Stepping back, he lifts his sword and HAMMERS it deep into

     the wood.

                                BRENNA

                                (crying)

                          Oh God...

     He STRIKES again.  And again.  Splinters smack against surround-

     ing walls.

                                BRENNA

                          Go away!  Oh God, go

                          away!

     CRYING hysterically, Brenna presses herself against the far

     wall, sliding to the floor in a crouch.

     THE KNIGHT

     Steps back and gives the door a last two-fisted swing.

     Brenna SCREAMS.

     The door collapses.

113  EXT. HIGHWAY - EVENING                                        113

     A group of unmarked police cars race by with the last light

     of day.

114  INT. CAR                                                      114

     At the wheel is Moran's assistant, the inspector.

114  INT. HOME - NIGHT                                             114

     Taupin stands at his fireplace, the only light in the room,

     poking at it with a tong.

     His gaze goes to a mantle clock.

     It is 10:30 PM.

     The phone RINGS.

     He looks to it.

     It RINGS again.

     He picks up the receiver slowly and places it against his ear.

                                KNIGHT'S VOICE

                          We have some unfinished

                          business.

                                TAUPIN

                          Are you here?

                                KNIGHT'S VOICE

                          I want you to come to

                          me.

                                TAUPIN

                          And if I refuse?

                                KNIGHT'S VOICE

                          Give me an address where

                          I can forward Miss Cart-

                          wright's head.

     This affects him.

                                KNIGHT'S VOICE

                          Yes laddie, I have her.

                                TAUPIN

                          Should I care?

                                KNIGHT

                          You have three hours.

115  EXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT                                       115

     The unmarked cars shoot by.

116  INT. HOME                                                     116

     Taupin hangs up the phone.

     He looks to the sword on the table, reflecting the firelight.

117  EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT                                        117

     POLICE OFFICERS, placed around Taupin's house, are COCKING

     shotguns and CHAMBERING pistols.

     Two officers take positions on either side of the door.  A

     third, after getting the signal, kicks the door open.

118  INT. FARMHOUSE                                                118

     The officers drop to firing positions in the doorway.  The

     room is empty.

119  INT. FARMHOUSE BEDROOM                                        119

     An officer BURSTS in.  It's empty.

120  INT. MAIN ROOM                                                120

     The Inspector is on the phone.

                                INSPECTOR

                          He's not here.

121  EXT. THE JEFFERSON MEMORIAL - NIGHT                           121

     Spotlights seperate the whitemarble from the surrounding

     blackness.

     Taupin's face moves into frame.

122  EXT. MONUMENT STAIRS - NIGHT                                  122

     Sword firmly in one hand, Taupin climb's the monument's steps.

123  INT. JEFFERSON MEMORIAL - NIGHT                               123

     A twenty-five foot bronze of Thomas Jefferson flanked by his

     quotations.

     A sword in one hand and Brenna in the other, the Knight stands

     at the statue's base.

                                KNIGHT

                          Welcome.

     Taupin stands at the entrance.

                                KNIGHT

                          Kahn sends his best.

     In a corner the Asian's head lies on its side, the horror of

     death still pressed into the face.  Taupin's eyes return slowly

     to the Knight and Brenna.

                                TAUPIN

                          Let her go.

    The Knight throws Brenna roughly against a wall.

                                KNIGHT

                          You disappoint me.

                             (looks at Brenna)

                          I thought you'd finally gotten over

                          that sort of thing.

                                TAUPIN

                          Leave her out of this.

                                KNIGHT

                          As you wish.

    The Knight holds his sword out at a ceremonial angle.  Taupin

    does the same.  The weapons are CLANKED together twice, then

    pulled back into battle position.

    The two begin walking a circle, poised swords waiting for an

    opening.

    The Knight leaps first, his clash of steel RINGING off the high

    walls.

    Another ATTACK without result.

                                KNIGHT

                          You can do better than that.

    Taupin swings.  The Knight jumps back.  Sweat gleams from their

    brows.

124 EXT. JEFFERSON MEMORIAL - NIGHT                                124

    Two LOVERS enjoy a late night walk along the tidal basin.

    There is a distant CLANKING of metal.

                                BOY

                          It's from over near the memorial.

    He jumps up on a rock.  Several yards away can be seen two figures

    attacking each other.

                                BOY

                          Shit.

125 INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT                                 125

    Standing at a map of the city, Moran nurses a cup of coffee.

    The phone RINGS.

                                MORAN

                          Moran.  All right, get a patrol

                          unit out there right away.  I'll

                          meet them.

126 INT. JEFFERSON MEMORIAL - NIGHT                                126

    The Knight and Taupin are PANTING heavily.

    The Knight goes low.  Taupin blocks.  The Knight comes overhead

    quickly.  Taupin misjudges and the blade slices deep into his

    shoulder and chest.  The impact knocks him flat on his back.

    The Knight looks down on his wounded prey.

    A SCREECH of brakes from outside the monument.  Two OFFICERS

    are coming up the steps.

                                KNIGHT

                          No.  Not now.

127 EXT. MEMORIAL - NIGHT                                          127

    The officers reach the top and enter.

    INSIDE

    One of the officers is Dennis, who sees only a CRYING Brenna

    and Taupin lying wounded on the floor.

                                DENNIS

                          Brenna?

    The Knight rushes up from behind, his sword in full swing.

128 EXT. INTERSECTION - NIGHT                                      128

    Moran's car blows through a cross street.

129 INT. CAR                                                       129

    Moran is at the wheel.

130 INT. MEMORIAL - NIGHT                                          130

    The Knight walks from the two officers spread out like rag

    dolls on the floor.

                                KNIGHT

                              (to Taupin)

                          Get up.

    Taupin looks at Brenna and the dead policemen.  A resignation

    sweeps over him.

                                TAUPIN

                          What's the point?

                                KNIGHT

                          This isn't done.  Get up.

                                TAUPIN

                          What's the point!  You have me,

                          finish it!

                                KNIGHT

                          I have waited forever for this.

                          You will not cheapen it, little

                          boy.

                                TAUPIN

                                (irony)

                          Tradition.

                                KNIGHT

                          It's all we have.

                                TAUPIN

                          Go to hell.

    The Knight looks to Brenna.

                                KNIGHT

                          Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like

                          to play.

                                TAUPIN

                          Leave her alone.

                                KNIGHT

                          Get up.

    Taupin struggles to his feet.  Blood pouring from his shirt, he

    stands uneasily with his sword at ready.

    The Knight swings.  Taupin blocks.

131 EXT. MEMORIAL - NIGHT                                          131

    Moran drives up.  There is an empty police car, the door still

    ajar.

132 INT. MEMORIAL - NIGHT                                          132

    Taupin is badly outclassed.

    He feebly fends off an attack, but the Knight returns quickly

    with a savage SLICE that rips open Taupin's stomach and throws

    him again to the floor.

                                BRENNA

                          You bastard!

                                KNIGHT

                          Be silent.

                                BRENNA

                          Leave him alone.

                                KNIGHT

                          You will be silent!!

    The voice is THUNDERING.

    Taupin kneels with his forehead pressed against the floor.  His

    teeth grind in pain.

    The Knight smiles.

                                KNIGHT

                          I do hope you're enjoying this

                          as much as me.

    MORAN

    Stands in the entryway.  The Knight sees him.

                                KNIGHT

                          Get out.

    Moran draws his pistol.

    The Knight walks toward him,

                                KNIGHT

                          This is nothing that concerns you.

    Moran levels his gun.

    The Knight raises his sword.

                                KNIGHT

                          You will leave!

    Two EXPLOSIONS as Moran FIRES.  The slugs slam into the Knight,

    blowing him off his feet.

    He lies still.

    Moran looks to Brenna.  To Taupin.  Then he walks closer to the

    Knight.

                                TAUPIN

                               (hoarse)

                          Don't.

    Taupin curls in a spasm of pain.

    Moran moves closer.

    The Knight lies face down, blood oozing from exit wounds over

    his heart.  He isn't breathing.

    Moran bends over slowly to see the Knight's face.

                                TAUPIN

                          Stop.  You don't understand.

    The Knight suddenly rolls over and plants his sword into Moran's

    chest.  The pistol DISCHARGES against a far wall.

    Taupin crawls for the Knight.

    Moran's mouth opens but no sound escapes.  The Knight, blood

    pouring from his mouth and nose, thrusts deeper then retracts

    quickly.

    Moran slides off the sword dead.

    Taupin CUTS hard against the Knight's chest.  The Knight GAGS

    in surprise and crumples.  Taupin CUTS again, then puts the

    blade against the Knight's GURGLING throat.

                                TAUPIN

                          In mamus tuas Domine commendo

                          spiritum meum.  Auditorium nostrum

                          in nomine Domine.

    He raises the sword.

                                TAUPIN

                          Requiescant in pace.

    And CUTS the Knight's head off.

    Taupin drops his sword.

    His breathing quickens.

    A sensation sweeps over him.

    Taupin drops to the floor WHIMPERING.  He sucks in painful gulps

    of air.

                                BRENNA

                          My God.

    Taupin bolts up and looks at her without seeing.

                                BRENNA

                          Conor.

    Taupin is looking past her.

    A blood-stained hand suddenly GRABS Brenna's shoulder.  She

    SCREAMS.  The headless body of the Knight stands beside her.

    THE KNIGHT'S HEAD

    Lies on the floor.

    The eyes open.  The face pulls into a smile.

                                KNIGHT

                          And now you know.

    The eyes roll up into the skull.  The face slackens.

    The hulking mass standing beside Brenna sways, the collapses

    to the ground.

    TAUPIN

    Is CRYING.  Not from wounds he no longer feels, but from something

    else.

                                BRENNA

                          What's wrong?

                                TAUPIN

                          I can't stand it.  Oh God, I can't

                          stand it!

    Brenna kneels beside him.

                                TAUPIN

                          The scream of your blood.  The

                          shriek of trees.  Stop it!  Stop it!

    Brenna SOBS.

                                BRENNA

                          What is it?

                                TAUPIN

                          I'm the last.  Oh Christ, I'm the

                          _last one_!

    Taupin doubles over in pain.  The pain of the whole world trying

    to force itself into him.

    Brenna tries to hold him.  He pushes her savagely away.

                                TAUPIN

                          Get out.

                                BRENNA

                          No!

                                TAUPIN

                          I'll destroy you.  I've destroyed

                          everything I've ever touched!  Oh

                          God...

    He doubles over in pain.

                                BRENNA

                          Conor...

    He grabs his sword and threatens her.

                                TAUPIN

                          _Get out_!

    SOBBING, Brenna runs from the memorial.  Taupin is alone.

    Bleeding.  Crying.  In agony.

    FADE OUT

    FADE UP:

133 INT. SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM                                        133

    Brenna at work in the research area.  She's silent.  Distant.

    Something is missing from her.

134 EXT. GEORGETOWN STREET - DAY                                   134

    Brenna stands in the street before Taupin's townhouse.

    A boarded up window.  A for-sale sign.  Taupin is gone forever.

    As if he never was.

135 INT. BRENNA'S APARTMENT                                        135

    A desk.  A single light.  A cup of coffee.

    A typewriter.

    Brenna tries to force thoughts to the surface.  CLACK-CLACK.

    It is at last her journal article.  She types a line, then rips

    it from the carriage and tears it to pieces.

    The thoughts won't come.

136 EXT. WASHINGTON MALL - DAY                                     136

    Brenna sits on the expanse of grass throwing scraps to a group

    of wild park cats.

    A shadow covers her face.  She looks up.

    It is Taupin.

    Something has changed him.  His face is less cynical.  More

    vulnerable.  More human.

    He sits down on the grass beside her.

                                BRENNA

                             (after a moment)

                          What are we supposed to say?

    The cat's eyes are all fixed in Taupin.  They cautiously shrink

    away, frightened.

                                TAUPIN

                          The emptyness.  The years and years

                          of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only

                          by the quest for ultimate nothingness.

                          Who would have guessed?

                                BRENNA

                          The inheritance.

                                TAUPIN

                          Not power.  Not control.

    Taupin holds a blade of grass as if it was speaking to him.

                                TAUPIN

                          Life.  It is the gift and the under-

                          standing of life.

                                BRENNA

                          You have lived forever.

                                TAUPIN

                          Life is only life when it is bounded

                          by death.  The inheritance is death.

                          The gift is the finality of life.

                          To be part of the fabric.  The inside.

                              (turns to Brenna)

                          I love you Brenna.

    Brenna's chin quivers.

                                TAUPIN

                          It will be horrible.  The future.  I

                          may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows.

                          I can promise you nothing.  Nothing

                          but a moment.  Maybe two.  But a moment

                          of love, is that not worth a lifetime?

                                BRENNA

                               (crying)

                          Yes.

    He holds her.  They hold each other.

                                TAUPIN

                          It's taken me so long.  So very

                          long.

    A jogger runs by, unaware of any life but his own.

    FADE OUT

    _END_
