                                        Written by

                    Peter Hewitt, William Osborne & Michael McCullers 

               Animated scenes of the Thunderbirds on various rescues begin 

               to play as some of the cast and crew names show up.

                             NARRATOR

               From a secret island in the South Pacific, 

               the courageous Tracy family run an organization               

               called International Rescue. When disaster strikes, anywhere 

               in the world, they are always first on the

               scene. They go by the name they gave their incredible machines, 

               the Thunderbirds.

               (Counts down numbers and shows corresponding

               Thunderbirds) Five, four, three, two, one. Thunderbirds are go!

               Cuts to live action, Alan Tracy is looking out a school window.

               But in this family of heroes, there is one son left behind.

                             TEACHER

               So, gentlemen, we all know that A2 plus 

               B2 equals... C2, that's right. But what 

               happens when we bring in Leonardo Da Vinci's E,

               F and... (Teacher notices Alan looking out window

               and not paying attention to the lesson) Mr. Tracy!

                             FERMAT

               Alan. Alan!

               Alan's head jerks back from the window and to the teacher who 

               is now standing in front of him.

                             TEACHER

               How kind of you to come back from outer 

               space, Alan. I trust re-entry wasn't 

               too rough?

               (Chuckles sarcastically and continues sounding even more annoyed) 

               Here on Earth we've been discussing the Pythagorean

               theorem. Did any of that happen to sink in?

                             ALAN TRACY

               I was just...

                             TEACHER

               Apparently not (she picks up his notebook 

               which he has been doodling in) "Thunderbirds 

               are go."

               Well, I hope you aren't going anywhere special over spring 

               break, Alan. Because I expect a 10,000 word paper on my desk

               the day you get back. That should keep you busy.

               Bells rings dismissing the students and Alan and Fermat walk 

               out to their lockers.

                             ALAN

               (mocking the teacher) "That should keep 

               you busy. Yeah, well you can take your 

               10,000 words 

               and stick them right up your..."

                             FERMAT

               Alan!

               Both boys turn around to see the headmaster approaching them 

               while walking by with the teacher from before

                             ALAN

               Headmaster.

                             HEADMASTER

               Mr. Tracy!

                             ALAN

               Miss Garrett.

                             FERMAT

               You gotta be more careful Alan.

                             ALAN

               Why can't I tell 'em I'm a Thunderbird 

               Fermat?

                             FERMAT

               Because technically you're not a Thunderbirds 

               yet. And if your identity was discovered, 

               it would a d-d-di- it could be very bad.

                             ALAN

               I know, I know.

                             EXCITED KID

               It's the Thunderbirds. They're gonna 

               be on TV. Let's go! They're gonna be 

               on TV.

                             ALAN

               Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Where are they?

                             EXCITED KID

               In Russia, at an oil rig fire.

                             ALAN

               Great! I'm stuck at school and my brothers 

               are on another cool mission.

                             FERMAT

               Wanna watch?

                             ALAN

               Yeah!

               Boys go into a crowded room with a TV on the news channel

                             LISA LOWE

               We are told this super-rig is now in 

               danger of total collapse.

               And there is real concern for the lives of six 

               men who remain trapped on board.

               An emergency call went out to the Thunderbirds just a few minutes 

               ago. They should be here any moment now.

               (pauses and points at the sky while exclaiming excitedly) 

               And here they are!

               The boys watching the TV begin to cheer

                             SCOTT TRACY

               Thunderbird 2 this is Thunderbird 1. 

               I have visual, south

               column, they're trapped on an inspection platform.

                             JEFF TRACY

               FAB. We'll take it from here.

                             MULLION

               Come on! Come on!

                             JEFF

               Scott, get out. That tower's coming 

               down.

                             SCOTT

               Got it.

               A blast of fire hits Thunderbird 1 and sends it a little farther 

               away from the accident zone.

                             JEFF

               Thunderbird 1 any damage?

                             SCOTT

               Negative, Dad.

                             ALAN

               Come on, come on! Swing around. You 

               can't get close enough, taking that 

               approach angle.

                             JEFF

               This approach angle's no good. Gonna 

               have to swing her around.

                             SCOTT

               Watch the wind shear Thunderbird 2.

                             JEFF

               Scotty, I was watching for wind shear 

               when you were still wearing diapers.

                             ALAN

               Come on, Dad.

               A blast of fire comes toward Thunderbird 2

                             JEFF

               Whoa! Hold on!

                             SCOTT

               Who needs the diapers now, Dad?

                             FERMAT

               What do they do now?

                             ALAN

               Probably drop the rescue platform from 

               Thunderbird 2.

                             VIRGIL TRACY

               Open 'em up. Here we go. Rescue platform's 

               on its way.

                             JEFF

               Virgil, how's it going?

                             VIRGIL

               It's looking good, Dad.

                             CREW MEMBER

               Come on! Jump!

                             VIRGIL

               Okay, I've got a visual. Hold it there. 

               Targets locked. Firing rescue lines. 

               (Directed toward the

               crew members who he just fired the rescue lines toward) Come 

               on, guys, hook 'em up. We gotta get

               you out of here.

                             CREW MEMBER

               READY

                             ANOTHER CREW MEMBER

               HOIST AWAY!

                             JEFF

               Alright, let's haul them out.

                             FERMAT

               Commencing reverse thrust.

                             JEFF

               Okay, let's bring 'em home.

                             CREW MEMBER

               Look out! (a couple of crew members 

               bump into each other as they are hoisted 

               up)

                             ALAN

               Man they gotta get 'em out fast. That 

               rig's gonna blow.

                             CREW MEMBER

               Hang on!

               Boys watching the TV gasp as the crew goes down back toward the 

               water a little bit

                             JEFF

               Whoa sorry, boys. Hold on tight. Here 

               we go.

                             ALAN

               Come on, Virgil.

                             VIRGIL

               Hold on guys

                             JEFF

               How you doing, son?

                             VIRGIL

               Never better

                             JEFF

               Thunderbird 1, commence knockdown procedure.

                             SCOTT

               FAB, Thunderbird 2. (after pressing 

               a bunch of buttons on his control panel) 

               Lining up target.

               Fire!

                             JEFF

               Bull's-eye! Outstanding shot. All right 

               boys, let's take these babies home.

                             LISA LOWE

               As you can see the fire has been extinguished. 

               The rocket fired from Thunderbird 1 

               has

               robbed it of the oxygen it needed to burn. Amazing! The Thunderbirds 

               have done it again, Chuck! '

               The boys watching the TV with Alan and Fermat begin cheering.

                             CHUCK

               That was great work, Lisa. Thanks a 

               lot.

                             KNOW IT ALL KID

               (directed at Alan) Ooh, I wish I could 

               be a Thunderbird one

               day. Thunderturd!

               The boys in the room "ooohh" and look at Alan for a response

                             ALAN

               That's another good one, diaper boy.

               All the boys look at the Know It All Kid and laugh

                             HEADMASTER

               Tracy! (after finding Alan in the sea 

               of boys he continues) There's someone 

               here for you.

               Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward, at your service. Alan darling, 

               your father's been unexpectedly detained.

               And he's asked me to pick you up. Is that all right?

                             FERMAT

               Sure beats the bus!

                             ALAN

               Definitely!

                             LADY PENELOPE

               Fantastic. Now, will any of these gorgeous 

               young things be joining you?

               All of the boys raise their hands and shout for Alan to choose 

               them.

                             ALAN

               Just Fermat.

                             LADY PENELOPE

               Quite right.

                             ALAN

               Lady Penelope, why are you in America? 

               Are you on a mission for my father?

                             LADY PENELOPE

               Alan, shh! I am an undercover agent, 

               so please try to be discreet. (camera 

               pans over to

               Lady Penelope's pink car with Parker, her butler waiting by the 

               open door.) Here we are.

                             FERMAT

               Hi, Parker.

                             PARKER

               Good afternoon, Master Hackenbacker.

                             ALAN

               Hi, Nosey.

                             PARKER

               Less of that attitude, or I shall be 

               obliged to deliver the Parker Haymaker.

                             ALAN

               Okay, bring it on, big guy.

               They are all in the car and Parker is driving away

                             LADY PENELOPE

               Try not to run over any children, Parker.

                             PARKER

               Very good, milady.

                             LADY PENELOPE

               Come on, Parker, chop chop!

               Lady Penelope's begins to fly

                             ALAN

               All right!

                             FERMAT

               Whoa!

                             ALAN

               YES!

                             FERMAT

               Yeah! the boys high five

                             LADY PENELOPE

               (reading a newspaper) Oh, look, Parker. 

               Pink is the new black this season.

                             PARKER

               I'm very glad to hear it, milady.

                             LADY PENELOPE

               And hemlines are going up.

                             PARKER

               That is good news, milady.

                             LADY PENELOPE

               Oh and apparently England won the football 

               last night.

                             PARKER

               Yes! Eng-er-land! (his hands go off 

               the steering wheel and the car begins 

               to move to one side)

                             FERMAT AND ALAN

               Whoa!

                             LADY PENELOPE

               Calm down, Parker.

                             PARKER

               Yes, milady. Sorry, milady.

                             SCENE CHANGE TO

               San Francisco City Hospital California, 

               USA parking lot.

                             PANHEAD'S MOTHER

               Come on, baby. Out you jump. (Turns 

               to her teenage son who has a pan stuck 

               on

               his head) Wait till your father hears about this, panhead! They 

               are walking toward the hospital

               Even better! It's the Thunderbirds!

                             VIRGIL

               OK, lock it up. Let's go. Let's move 

               it. Hey, we need some help over here.

                             JEFF

               Mission complete. Thunderbird 1 we are 

               good to go.

                             SCOTT

               FAB.

               Mullion walks away from the others and fires a tracking goo at 

               Thunderbird 1.

               Scene switches to a moving underwater submarine

                             THE HOOD

               Ah, the chariot of the gods. Having 

               dallied with the mortals,

               they return to Olympus. And so I follow.

                             PARKER

               Pardon me, milady. Approaching Tracy 

               Island. And radar indicates we have 

               some company.

               Thunderbird 1 and 2 pull up next to Lady Penelope's flying car 

               and Scott waves at Alan before Alan

               turns to look at Thunderbird 2 where his father salutes at him. 

               Thunderbird 1 then does a barrel roll

               around Thunderbird 2 before they both jet off toward the island, 

               leaving Lady Penelope's car behind.

                             LADY PENELOPE

               Now, that's showing off.

                             ALAN

               I wish that was me.

                             BRAINS

               I'm about to run post flight checks, 

               Mr Tracy. Anything I sh-sh-sh-

               Anything you want to tell me?

                             JEFF

               Brains, I noticed a build-up of vibration 

               on Thunderbird 2, followed by illumination 

               of the number 5

               engine out light.

                             BRAINS

               Okay, Mr. Tracy, I'll ch-ch-ch-study 

               the flight data and guidance processor.

                             ALAN

               Dad!

                             JEFF

               Alan! Let me look at you. He hold Alan 

               at arm's length and then looks him over. 

               He then looks

               over and sees his older sons approaching. Ah oh look out.

                             VIRGIL

               Hey Sprout! ruffles his hair

                             SCOTT

               ruffles his hair Hey Buddy!

                             ONAHA

               Dinner's ready. Come and get it.

                             JEFF

               Onaha, it smells delicious. I am starved.

                             ALAN

               So Dad, I saw the mission on TV. It 

               looked dangerous.

                             JEFF

               Saving lives is a dangerous business. 

               But it's what we do.

                             ALAN

               Do you think the fire was caused by 

               thermal up draughts? I mean that would 

               explain the-- (Jeff

               cuts him off)

                             JEFF

               Whoa, whoa, whoa, enough shop talk. 

               I want to hear about school.

                             ALAN

               School's boring. Plus I've been thinking, 

               maybe I could be home-educated now. 

               That way, I could

               sit in on missions from time to time. What do you think?

                             JEFF

               No short cuts, Alan. No school, no rockets. 

               Say, why aren't you wearing your retainer?

                             SCOTT

               So I'm getting the reading telling me 

               that the wind is blowing 60 knots, right 

               up my keister.

                             VIRGIL

               No kidding.

                             ALAN

               Did you try readjust the flaps?

                             SCOTT

               Well that's the first thing I did, Sprout! 

               It's not my first day in a Thunderbird 

               you know.

                             GORDON

               Try and keep up!

                             VIRGIL

               Yeah and don't you have homework to 

               do or something?

                             GORDON

               Unless he's blown up this school, like 

               the last one!

                             SCOTT

               Yeah, keep Alan away from the ships, 

               he's a hazard.

                             JEFF

               Okay, that's enough. Pass the salad.

                             VIRGIL

               Man, I haven't seen that much fire since 

               that volcano in Fiji.

                             SCOTT

               That wasn't Fiji that was Istanbul.

                             VIRGIL

               No, no, Istanbul was the earthquake.

                             SCOTT

               Yeah well, nothing compares to Argentina.

                             ALAN

               Dad, I'm not really hungry. Come on, 

               Fermat. Let's go.

                             FERMAT

               But! I'm not done! (sighs) Okay.

               After dinner

                             JEFF

               Kyrano, have you seen Lady P?

                             KYRANO

               By the pool.

                             JEFF

               Of course.

                             LADY PENELOPE

               (answers her ringing cell phone) Parker.

               Scene changes to Alan and Fermat about to enter Thunderbird 1's 

               silo.

                             FERMAT

               We're not supposed to go in there. We 

               could get in trouble.

                             ALAN

               Ah, you worry too much.

                             FERMAT

               Where'd you get the access code for 

               Thunderbird 1 anyway?

                             ALAN

               Fermat, my friend, what you don't know, 

               can't hurt you.

               Scene changes back to Lady Penelope and Jeff by the pool

                             LADY PENELOPE

               I'll be right there. It seems the fire 

               at the oil rig was no accident.

                             JEFF

               Any suspects?

                             LADY PENELOPE

               Not yet, but I'll keep you posted.

                             ALAN

               Thanks for bringing Alan home.

                             LADY PENELOPE

               My pleasure. Any excuse to visit paradise.

                             JEFF

               Tintin!

                             TINTIN

               Hey, Mr. Tracy.

                             LADY PENELOPE

               Hello, Tintin.

                             TINTIN

               Good evening, Lady Penelope.

                             JEFF

               Did you know Alan's home?

                             TINTIN

               (makes an annoyed face) Alan's back? 

               (changes her tone to a more pleasant 

               one) I mean, oh,

               Alan's back! (looks at Kyrano) Hey, Dad.

                             JEFF

               When are those two going to get along?

                             LADY PENELOPE

               When Tintin decides the time is right. 

               Girls always fire ahead of boys with 

               that sort of

               thing.

                             JEFF

               What sort of thing?

                             LADY PENELOPE

               (rolls her eyes) Romance.

                             JEFF

               Alan and Tintin? I didn't see that one 

               coming.

                             LADY PENELOPE

               No, you wouldn't.

                             JEFF

               Have a safe flight home, Penny.

                             LADY PENELOPE

               Thanks, Jeff.

               Scene switches to Fermat and Alan playing around in Thunderbird 

               1 like they are really about to fly it

               into a mission.

                             ALAN

               Okay, Fermat. Run pre-flight checks.

                             FERMAT

               Right. Hydraulic systems are green.

                             ALAN

               Commence main engine sequence.

                             FERMAT

               FAB, Alan.

                             ALAN

               Couldn't hurt to just fire up the instruments.

                             FERMAT

               No wait, Alan! That's the(Thunderbird 

               1 begins to start up and Fermat shouts) 

               Wrong switch!

                             ALAN

               Oh God. (There is loud beeping coming 

               from the control panel and the boys 

               can't shut down

               Thunderbird 1) Oh, could this day get any worse?

               Scene briefly changes to Jeff getting an alert in his office.

                             JEFF

               (his face appears on a monitor in Thunderbird 

               1) Alan, my office. Now. (Thunderbird 

               1 shuts

               down)

                             FERMAT

               It just did.

               The boys walk out of Thunderbird 1 and are walking toward the 

               silo door. Fermat is running his hand

               on the nosecone of Thunderbird 1.

                             ALAN

               I can't believe it.

                             FERMAT

               We're so b-b-busted.

               Fermat's hand touches the goo that Mullion fired at Thunderbird 

               1 earlier.

                             FERMAT

               Look at this.

                             ALAN

               What is it?

                             FERMAT

               Looks like some sort of, gallium-electrolyte 

               compound.

                             ALAN

               We gotta get out of here.

               Scene changes to Alan walking into his dad's office.

                             ALAN

               Dad, I know you're mad. I shouldn't 

               have been in the ship, but if you just 

               give me a minute to

               explain- (Jeff cuts him off)

                             JEFF

               You're damn right you shouldn't have 

               been in there!

                             ALAN

               But, nothing happened Dad. I had it 

               under control.

                             JEFF

               Under control? Do you have any idea 

               of the importance of secrecy in our 

               operation? You fired up

               a Thunderbird without activating the anti-detection shield. You 

               put everyone in danger when you act

               selfishly. You want to be part of the team, you have to play 

               by the rules. You understand? (Alan just

               looks at him) Do you?

                             ALAN

               Yeah, I understand. I understand you 

               don't want me to be a Thunderbird. You 

               don't want me to

               do anything. You won't even listen to me when I'm trying to tell 

               you something important!

                             JEFF

               I've heard enough. You're grounded for 

               the rest of spring break.

                             ALAN

               But, Dad!

                             JEFF

               Bottom line, Alan. You need to grow 

               up.

                             ALAN

               Then let me. (he stalks toward the door 

               before whispering,) Please!

               Jeff is starting at two old family photos on his desk when the 

               video phone rings.

                             JEFF

               Hey, John. I was just about to turn 

               in. What can I do for you?

                             JOHN TRACY

               I could sure use a pizza. You know a 

               place that delivers?

                             JEFF

               30 minutes or it's free, right? Anything 

               else on your mind?

                             JOHN

               Well, got a forest fire in Vladivostok, 

               a typhoon heading for Singapore. What's 

               happening on

               Planet Tracy?

                             JEFF

               Alan's home for spring break.

                             JOHN

               Yeah, I thought I could see a storm 

               brewing in your region.

                             JEFF

               Teenagers.

                             JOHN

               Well, we've all been there. And Dad, 

               you've done a great job since Mom died.

                             JEFF

               Thanks, John. Keep an eye on that typhoon 

               for us. And, uh, I'll call Vladivostok, 

               see if they need

               help with that fire.

                             JOHN

               FAB, Dad. Sleep tight.

               Fermat is down with his father in the Thunderbirds hanger.

                             FERMAT

               Morning, Dad.

                             BRAINS

               Hey, son. There's something I'd like 

               to sh-sh-sh- Here, take a look.

                             FERMAT

               The neural-net control system?

                             BRAINS

               It's great to have you back. I bet you 

               didn't think spring break was going 

               to be this w- w-fun.

               Watch this.

               Brains uses the neural-net control system to lift up the phone 

               in front of him. It also lifts up the Mole

               which is stationed behind his workplace.

                             BRAINS

               And that tiny phone lifts up, perfect.

                             FERMAT

               Dad?

               The neural-net control system short circuits.

                             BRAINS

               N-n-n- Almost perfect.

                             FERMAT

               There's something I want to talk to 

               you about.

                             BRAINS

               Oh. Right. Oh. OK, right. You're having 

               problems with a g-g-g-chi-chi-chi-wo-wo-female?

                             FERMAT

               N-no! No. Alan and I found some sort 

               of gallium compound on the nosecone 

               of Thunderbird

               1.

                             BRAINS

               We should check that out st-st-st-immediately.

                             FERMAT

               That'd be g-g-g-swell!

               Scene skips to Alan skipping rocks at the beach. The camera 

               follows one rock and it leads to a

               telescope coming out of the water. The telescope is connected 

               to the Hood's submarine.

                             MULLION

               The island is in sight.

                             THE HOOD

               Transom, I need you.

                             TRANSOM

               Yes, sir. Sir, our cloaking device has 

               evaded their detection

               systems. We have a positive visual from the tracking solution 

               on Thunderbird 1.

                             THE HOOD

               Mullion.

                             MULLION

               Sir? Sir, armed and ready. Shall I target 

               the main structure?

                             THE HOOD

               Why would I want to destroy what will 

               soon be mine? One of the principle tenets 

               of Eastern

               martial arts is to use your opponent's strength against him.

               The Hood uses his powers to keep Mullion in place

                             MULLION

               (trying to move and realizing that he 

               can't) This is ridiculous.

                             THE HOOD

               It will be almost impossible to force 

               the Thunderbirds to leave their island. 

               On the other

               hand, it requires no effort at all to let them go.

               The Hood stops using his powers on Mullion and Mullion falls 

               over.

                             THE HOOD

               The Thunderbirds' purpose is to rescue. 

               All we need do is give them the victim. 

               (The Hood

               looks at Transom) Commence targeting.

                             TRANSOM

               Straightaway, sir. Target acquisition 

               of Thunderbird 5 is locked.

                             THE HOOD

               Fire.

               Transom fires a missile at Thunderbird 5.

               Scene switches to John on Thunderbird 5 when suddenly alarms 

               start to go off around him.

                             JOHN

               What the?

                             JOHN

               Thunderbird 5 to Tracy Island. Mayday! 

               Mayday!

               Missile hits Thunderbird 5 and John is blow back into a wall 

               from the explosion. The scene then

               switches over to Tracy Island.

               Brains and Fermat run into Jeff's office.

                             BRAINS

               Switching to Command and Control Center. 

               (Brains uses a palm scanner to activate 

               Command

               and Control)

               The submarine is briefly showed getting closer to the island.

               Jeff, Scott, Virgil, and Gordon come running into Command and 

               Control.

                             JEFF

               How bad, Brains?

                             BRAINS

               Thunderbird 5 major damage sustained.

               Yep.

                             JEFF

                             JEFF

               Go to maximum thrust.

               Scene switches to the submarine.

                             THE HOOD

               There goes the cavalry. But who will 

               rescue the rescuers?

               Scene changes to Alan on the beach looking up at Thunderbird 

               3 launching and heading toward

               Thunderbird 5. Tintin runs up beside him and looks up as well.

                             FERMAT

               Alan! Tintin! Thunderbird 5 has been 

               hit! Thunderbird 5 has been hit! Thunderbird 

               5 has been

               hit!

                             ALAN

               Okay, Okay, Okay, Okay, Okay don't panic. 

               Don't panic.

               The children look toward the beach when they hear a noise and 

               see the submarine beginning to

               surface.

                             ALAN

               On the other hand.

                             ALAN, FERMAT, TINTIN

               Run!

               The kids run and hide behind some trees and shrubs. Scene then 

               switches to inside the submarine.

                             MULLION

               We made land.

                             THE HOOD

                             BRAINS

               What the he-he-devil is going on?

                             BRAINS

               Mr. Tracy, do you copy?

                             BRAINS

               Thunderbird 3 please respond.

               Scene switch back to the kids hiding on the beach.

                             ALAN

               How'd they find the island? Do you think 

               it was what I did in Thunderbird 1? 

               Do you think I ruined

               everything?

                             FERMAT

               No! That compound we found could have 

               some sort of transmitting capability.

                             TINTIN

               We have to do something.

                             FERMAT

               My dad's in the control room, but how 

               do we get there now?

                             ALAN

               The vents. Let's go! We have to get 

               a message to my dad.

                             JOHN

               I'm losing all power. Repeat, I'm losing

               Hold on, John. We're coming in. Gordon, 

               prepare for immediate docking.

                             GORDON

               You got it, Dad. Reverse main thrusters 

               on my mark. Three, two, one.

                             JEFF

               Jeff, Scott, Virgil, and Gordon are now in the damaged Thunderbird 

               5 with John.

                             JEFF

               John! Scott, tackle that fire.

                             JOHN

               Am I glad to see you guys!

                             JEFF

               Easy, you're hurt. Virgil, take care 

               of your brother. Gordon, give me a damage 

               assessment.

               Scene switch to back on the island. The kids are running through 

               the jungle while heading toward the

               vents and the Hood and his crew are heading toward Command and 

               Control.

               Inside the Tracy house Transom has found the closed door to Command

               Control room, whistling nervously to

               himself and reading a magazine upside down. On the other side 

               of the door there is muffled banging

               from where Mullion is trying to break open the door.

                             THE HOOD

               So, this is Mount Olympus. And these 

               are the Thunderbirds. I should have 

               guessed. Jeff

               Tracy, the billionaire, ex-astronaut, of course. Isn't he the 

               one who lost his wife in an accident?

               Avalanche wasn't it? How tragic.

               Scene switches to Alan, Tintin, and Fermat walking in the vents 

               toward the one that leads to the

               Command and Control room.

               Professor, you and I share an interest 

               in the science of the mind. The difference 

               is, I was

               born with my powers. Trust me when I tell you, you've barely 

               touched the surface. (Brains is forced to

               stand up and walked over to the Hood) Even the strongest minds 

               can be broken. It would be a pity to

               break yours.

                             BRAINS

               Fu-Fu-Fu- No way!

               Activate the control switch, Prof! (Uses 

               his powers to make BRAINS move) Like

               Okay, this one.

               Scene switches to Thunderbird 5.

                             JEFF

               Back to Thunderbird 3 now. (turns to 

               help an injured John) John, we gotta 

               move.

                             GORDON

               The locking mechanism's jammed!

                             THE HOOD

               Attention, Thunderbird 5. As you can 

               see I have taken over your facilities. 

               You no longer

               control your operational systems.

               Scene change back to the kids in the vent. They can stick their 

               heads out of the vent and see into the

               Command and Control Room, but they are hidden behind a panel 

               and the Hood and his minions

               cannot see them.

                             ALAN

               They've taken over.

                             THE HOOD

               Warm them up, Transom.

                             TRANSOM

               Increasing temperature to maximum.

               The children are now looking into the Command and Control room. 

               Kyrano and his wife, Onaha, are

               dragged in.

                             ALAN

               Who's the bald freak?

                             KYRANO

               You? The Hood uses his powers on him 

               and he falls down clutching his head.

                             TINTIN

               Dad!

                             FERMAT

               They've got m-my dad.

                             JEFF

               Okay, you have our attention. Who are 

               you? What do you want?

                             THE HOOD

               Oh how rude of me. You can call me The 

               Hood. Now, listen, Mr. Tracy. We won't 

               be

               negotiating. I'm going to use the Thunderbirds to rob the largest 

               banks in the world, starting with the

               Bank of London. The world's monetary system will be thrown into 

               chaos and the Thunderbirds held

               responsible.

                             SCOTT

               You'll never get away with it.

                             JEFF

               Why the Thunderbirds?

                             THE HOOD

               An eye for an eye, Mr. Tracy.

                             JEFF

               An eye for an eye?

                             THE HOOD

               Perhaps you've forgotten me, but surely 

               you remember saving the life of my brother,

               Kyrano?

                             KYRANO

               Turns to the video phone that the Hood 

               has been using to communicate with Thunderbird 

               5.

               I'm sorry, Mr. Tracy. I thought he was dead.

                             THE HOOD

               (Laughs and then turns to the guards)Take 

               them away.

                             MULLION

               Yes, sir.

               The kids lift their heads back up into the vents

                             ALAN

               Whoa.

                             TINTIN

               That makes The Hood my uncle?

                             FERMAT

               Every family has a black sh-sh- a black 

               sh- (Sneezes and everyone in the Command 

               and

               Control room looks around, while Brains pretends that it was 

               him that sneezed.)

                             FERMAT

               (Turns to look at Alan) This room's 

               murder with my allergies.

               The kids stick their heads back out the vent and look at what 

               is going on in the Command and Control

               room.

                             THE HOOD

               You left me to die that day. You may 

               have broken my body but you've no idea 

               how

               powerful my mind has become. And now you will suffer, as I suffered, 

               waiting for a rescue that will

               never come. (Makes a motion for Transom to cut off the call with 

               Thunderbird 5.)

                             JEFF

               Wait! (Video link cuts dead and then 

               the scene cuts to Thunderbird 5.) Scott, 

               status report.

                             SCOTT

               CO2 levels are rising.

                             JEFF

               Alright, wire the oxygen scrubber to 

               the emergency batteries. Clean the air.

                             VIRGIL

               How long will that give us?

                             JOHN

               About four hours.

               Scene switches back to the kids looking into the Command and 

               Control room. Fermat begins to start

               sneezing again. Tintin and Alan put their hands over his nose 

               and mouth to try and muffle the sound.)

                             MULLION

               Someone's there. (Mullion walks over 

               to the ceiling, he is standing directly 

               below where

               they are. The kids are trying to leave the vents when his hand 

               shoots up through the ceiling and grabs

               Alan's ankle. He lets go after Tintin bites his hand and he gasps 

               in pain.)

               The children are now talking loudly and everyone in the Command 

               and Control room can hear them.

                             TINTIN

               Run! Run!

                             ALAN

               No, jump! We can get through to the 

               silos.

               The children scream as they fall down a tunnel leading to the 

               silos. And the scene switches to the

               Command and Control room.

                             THE HOOD

               Apparently, the island is not as secure 

               as you thought. (he looks at the old 

               photos that were

               on Jeff's desk. Children! Did you find any children?

                             TRANSOM

               (Using the security cameras to see into 

               the silos) Here they are. Thunderbird 

               2 silo, in the

               loading arm.

               Mullion and two other guards run off to get them

                             THE HOOD

               (Speaking to Transom) Seal them in.

                             ALAN

               Hold on!

                             TINTIN

               The doors! You guys, let's go! C'mon

                             FERMAT

               Go! Go!

               The children reach the door that leads to Thunderbird 3's silo 

               just as it closes.

                             ALAN

               This way. (They run toward the still 

               closing Thunderbird 1 silo door.)

                             FERMAT

               (After the door closes before they can 

               get through it) No!

                             TINTIN

               They've got us trapped. What now?

                             FERMAT

               If we can get to the Thunderbird 1's 

               silo, we can escape through the service 

               tunnel. But we

               need a plan, Alan.

                             ALAN

               I'll use the Thunderizer on the door.

               guards are in the elevator heading down to come get them)

                             ALAN

               You guys get the goons with the Firefly!

                             FERMAT

               Alan! This equipment is only to be used 

               in an emergency. (Alan and Tintin give 

               him looks) I

               guess this qualifies.

                             ALAN

               Yeah.

                             TINTIN

               Here they come. Fermat, can you drive 

               this thing?

                             FERMAT

               Uh, no.

                             TINTIN

               Hey, watch it!

                             FERMAT

               I took microbiology, not driver's ed. 

               Set the pressure to maximum.

                             TINTIN

               Got it.

                             MULLION

               (The guards walk out of the elevator 

               and see Tintin pointing the Firefly 

               at them) Retreat!

               (They fall over and have trouble getting up due to the slipperiness 

               of the stuff fired at them)

                             TINTIN

               Let's move it.

                             ALAN

               That's it. Time to thunderize. (After 

               the door has a hole cut in it.) Yes!

                             ALAN

               Come on, let's go!

                             MULLION

               Get 'em!

                             ALAN

               Where's Fermat?

                             TINTIN

               Fermat!

                             ALAN

               Fermat!

                             FERMAT

               Coming!

                             ALAN

               Hurry up. (the children are now in Thunderbird 

               1's silo) What were you doing back there,

               Fermat?

                             FERMAT

               I had an-n-n idea.

                             ALAN

               Just try and keep up, okay? I'll open 

               the tunnel. We gotta keep moving. (Alan 

               types in a pass

               code)

                             ALAN

               (To Tintin and Fermat) Go back. Yell 

               when you see them coming. (tries another 

               pass code)

               Alan turns away from the door for a moment and the camera can 

               see The Hood on the other side of

               the door. Alan turns back and sees him.

                             THE HOOD

               Alan. You can run if you want. Were 

               you surprised to hear what your father 

               did to me? It is

               frightening when we realize our parents aren't perfect. But perhaps 

               you already suspected that about

               your father. Why did he build these magnificent machines? Do 

               you suppose it was guilt? Because he

               let your mother die. (Alan shakes his head no) Open the door, 

               Alan. (Alan continues to shake his head

               no) (The Hood chuckles at his refusal) Open, the, door. (He tries 

               to use his powers on Alan but nothing

               happens)

                             ALAN

               (Shouting to Tintin and Fermat) We can't 

               go this way. He's there.

               The Hood uses his powers to open the door and Mullion and the 

               other guards appear at the other

               doorway, leaving the children trapped.

                             FERMAT

               No! (he falls slightly) Ow. What are 

               we gonna do, Alan?

                             ALAN

               I don't know. I'm thinking, okay? (Alan 

               looks at the control panel behind the 

               Hood and sees a

               button that will open part of the floor under Thunderbird 1. 

               Keep backing up. I've got an idea. (Alan

               takes his rock launcher from the pouch it is in on the back of 

               his pants. and fires it at the button, but

               misses.)

                             TINTIN

               That's your idea?

                             THE HOOD

               It's not me you're angry at, Alan.

                             ALAN

               It's not you I'm aiming at. (Alan fires 

               another rock and this time hits the 

               button and the floor

               drops out from underneath Tintin, Fermat, and Alan. Tintin, Fermat, 

               and Alan scream as they fall.)

                             THE HOOD

               Get them!

                             MULLION

               Transom, fire up Thunderbird 1. And 

               set it on broil!

               The kids look behind them while they are falling down the tunnel 

               and see the flames coming from

               Thunderbird 1 behind them. Tintin screams even louder. The tunnel 

               opens up and leads to the ocean.

               Back in Command and Control

                             TRANSOM

               No sign of them.

                             MULLION

               Of course not, the little brats went 

               up like firecrackers. Pop, pop, pop! 

               (laughs at Brains and

               Brains moves to punch him.)

                             THE HOOD

               Don't, give him the satisfaction, Professor. 

               This is taking too long. Pick out the 

               equipment

               you need to get into those banks and load it into Thunderbird 

               2. No more delays.

                             MULLION

               Yes, sir.

               Scene switches to the children trying to get onto the beach, 

               they are getting knocked over by a couple

               of waves. Fermat is coughing and spluttering.

                             FERMAT

               How about a little warning next time 

               you pull a stunt like that?

                             ALAN

               Relax, Fermat. It's just a little water.

                             FERMAT

               I could have drowned.

                             ALAN

               You mean you can't swim?!

                             FERMAT

               I repeat, I could have drowned.

               Scene switches to the boys ringing out their shirts, they are 

               both in their boxers.

                             ALAN

               I said I was sorry, Fermat. Just put 

               this behind us, Okay? We gotta watch 

               each other's backs.

               Nice drawers.

                             FERMAT

               Thank you.

                             TINTIN

               Boo!

                             ALAN

               No, c'mon Tintin, stay there.

                             TINTIN

               You're worse than a couple of girls. 

               Hurry up and get dressed. (To Fermat) 

               Those are nice

               drawers!

               Scene switches to the children walking along one of the beaches.

                             FERMAT

               Data from Tracy Island is sent to Thunderbird 

               5 via satellite, right?

                             ALAN

               Right.

                             FERMAT

               So, there's a miniscule possibility 

               that if we reach the satellite station, 

               we could

                             ALAN

               Blow it up!

                             FERMAT

               No, we could hack in to it and give 

               control back to Thunderbird 5.

                             ALAN

               Good thinking, Fermat. Alright, let's 

               do it. (Alan starts drawing the plan 

               in the sand) Here's the

               plan. We're here, right?. So, we go along the shore around the 

               base of the mountain to the access road,

               here. And then up to the transmitter. So what do you think?

                             TINTIN

               Good. Except that we're here, not there, 

               and the transmitter is there, not here. 

               We have to go

               through the jungle.

                             FERMAT

               But that's f-f- off limits.

                             TINTIN

               It's gonna be dangerous.

                             ALAN

               I'm in. (All three of them put their 

               hands together) We gotta get up there 

               fast! All our folks are

               in trouble and if The Hood gets off the island

                             FERMAT

               Actually, he's not going anywhere for 

               now.

                             ALAN

               The guidance processor for Thunderbird 

               2. You can't take off without it. Fermat 

               you're a genius.

               How'd you get this?

                             FERMAT

               Alan, my friend, what you don't know, 

               can't hurt you.

               Scene switches to Lady Penelope's Country Mansion in England, 

               where Parker is out cleaning a car

               when the car phone rings.

                             LADY PENELOPE

               Parker?

                             PARKER

               Milady?

                             LADY PENELOPE

               We have an emergency.

               Scene switch to Lady Penelope's bathroom

                             LADY PENELOPE

               What a charming fellow.

               Someone knocks on the door.

                             LADY PENELOPE

               Come in.

               Parker enters Lady Penelope's bathroom, with tea, where she is 

               up to her shoulders in bubble bath.

                             LADY PENELOPE

               Have a look at this, Parker. (There 

               is a computer monitor near her feet.) 

               He, and this

               woman, poor girl, both work for this man, known as The Hood.

                             PARKER

               Sounds like an alias, milady.

                             LADY PENELOPE

               Quite right, Parker. Real name: Trangh 

               Belagant. Assumed dead when

               his illegal diamond mine collapsed in the jungles of the Malaya. 

               (takes a sip of tea) Oh, perfect, Parker.

               The Thunderbirds rescued over 500 mine workers, including Mr. 

               Belagant's brother.

                             PARKER

               Milady, that's Mr. Tracy's loyal manservant, 

               Kyrano.

                             LADY PENELOPE

               How's my schedule, Parker?

                             PARKER

               You have clay pigeon shooting with Lord 

               Marlborough, a benefit gala for the 

               Institute of the

               Blind, and incidentally there's a typhoon bearing down on Singapore.

                             LADY PENELOPE

               I suppose that's urgent.

                             PARKER

               Yes, milady. There was also a bridge 

               collapsed in Buenos Aires and a volcanic 

               eruption in

               Jakarta.

                             LADY PENELOPE

               The Thunderbirds haven't responded?

                             PARKER

               No, milady. And the media is awash in 

               speculation vis-a-vis their whereabouts. 

               Parker turns on

               the news.

                             CHUCK

               Over to Lisa Lowe.

                             LISA LOWE

               Chuck, disaster after disaster around 

               the world today and still no sight of 

               the Thunderbirds.

               Typhoon Jago hit land in Singapore just one hour ago and thousands 

               have been left homeless by a

               volcano in Jakarta. Only the Thunderbirds have the incredible 

               machines

                             LADY PENELOPE

               I think it's time to send the emergency 

               signal, Parker.

                             PARKER

               I fear you're not wrong, milady.

                             LISA LOWE

               Lisa Lowe. Back to you, Chuck.

               Parker hits the top of the tea pot and a light pops out and begins 

               to blink and beep. Back on Tracy

               Island a similar light begins to flash and bleep but Brains is 

               unable to get up to get to it because he is

               tied up.

               Scene switch to the kids walking through the jungle.

                             ALAN

               I'm telling you, Fermat, it was like 

               The Hood was inside my head back there.

                             FERMAT

               What do you mean, Alan?

                             ALAN

               Maybe he can read minds or control minds 

               or something.

                             FERMAT

               Don't be silly, Alan. Everything can 

               be explained by science.

                             ALAN

               I'm just trying to figure out his weakness. 

               Everybody has an Achilles heel, right?

                             FERMAT

               My Achilles heel is actually my Achilles 

               heel. It's got a blister the size of 

               a basketball. Tintin!

               Can we s-s-

                             TINTIN

               Stop?

                             FERMAT

               Yes!

                             TINTIN

               No!

                             FERMAT

               (sighs) Okay.

                             ALAN

               (Helping Fermat up the hill) No more 

               cheeseburgers for you, Fermat.

               Scene change back to Lady Penelope's house.

                             LADY PENELOPE

               Any word?

                             PARKER

               Nothing, milady.

                             LADY PENELOPE

               Right. You will have to tell Lord Marlborough 

               that I've broken my shooting arm. We

               shall send the Institute for the Blind a dozen guide dogs. And 

               bring the car around.

                             PARKER

               Yes, milady.

                             LADY PENELOPE

               The Thunderbirds appear to be in a spot 

               of trouble. And I don't like that. Let's 

               go,

               Parker.

               They get in the car and it takes off flying toward Tracy Island. 

               Scene switches to Mullion and the Hood

               in the Thunderbirds hanger.

                             MULLION

               Ready for launch. We'll use this to 

               get into the vaults.

                             THE HOOD

               Subtle, as usual, Mullion.

                             MULLION

               I didn't realize we'd be getting points 

               for style. We're robbing banks, remember.

               The Hood uses his power on Mullion and Mullion gasps.

                             THE HOOD

               Don't worry. You'll get your money.

                             MULLION

               (Looks over toward Thunderbird 2 and 

               speaks into headset) Transom, initiate 

               pre-flight

               diagnostics.

               An alarm suddenly goes off in Thunderbird 2.

                             MULLION

               What's going on?

                             TRANSOM

               It's the guidance processor.

                             MULLION

               What's wrong with it?

                             TRANSOM

               There isn't one.

                             MULLION

               Aaargh!

                             THE HOOD

               Clever Alan. It's the children. They 

               have it.

                             MULLION

               No way. They're dead. No one could live 

               through something like that.

                             THE HOOD

               I did. Get them, Mullion. Take whatever 

               you need. And make sure you get the 

               guidance

               processor before you lose your temper.

               Scene switches to the children in the jungle.

                             FERMAT

               Alan, don't you think Tintin is blossoming?

                             ALAN

               Blossoming?! What's that supposed to 

               mean?

                             FERMAT

               Come on, Alan. You've a c-crush on her.

                             ALAN

               You've got to be kidding. I mean, she's. 

               She's not that bad, I guess.

                             TINTIN

               (Reaches the top of the mountain) Okay, 

               guys, take five.

                             FERMAT

               (Still finishing climbing up the mountain)Five 

               isn't going to do it!

                             TINTIN

               Guys?

               Alan and Fermat reach the top of the mountain, they are both 

               puffing and panting. Tintin smiles at

               them before she sees a scorpion on Alan's shoulder.

                             TINTIN

               Don't move.

                             FERMAT

               (Sees scorpion when he stands up next 

               to Alan) Whoa

                             ALAN

               What is it?

                             TINTIN

               Hexdrotilous scorpion.

                             ALAN

               Is that dangerous?

                             FERMAT

               .025 milligrams of its venom is fatal.

                             ALAN

               So, dangerous is in fact an understatement.

               Tintin uses powers just like her uncle, The Hood, to lift the 

               scorpion off of Alan's shoulder and lets it

               fall to the ground.

                             FERMAT

               Watch out!

                             ALAN

               Tintin, what was that?

                             TINTIN

               Let's get going.

                             ALAN

               Hey! She has the same powers as her 

               uncle, The Hood.

                             FERMAT

               You think?

                             ALAN

               Must run in the family. Did you do that?

                             TINTIN

               Just drop it, okay?

                             ALAN

               Still think everything can be explained 

               by science?

                             FERMAT

               Not girls!

               Scene cuts to Thunderbird 5 where there is an alarm and then 

               an explosion near Scott and Gordon.

                             JEFF

               Scott? Gordon? You all right?

                             GORDON

               We're okay.

                             SCOTT

               The heat exchanger has blown.

                             JEFF

               You don't say.

               Scene switches back to Mullion and two other guards searching 

               the jungle for Alan, Tintin, and

               Fermat.

                             MULLION

               Come on! Those brats are in here somewhere.

               Scene change to the kids at the satellite transmitter.

                             ALAN

               How we doing Fermat?

                             FERMAT

               Don't rush me Alan. This is very d-delicate 

               equipment. (The circuit board sparks.) 

               Which is

               now b-b-broken.

                             ALAN

               Can you fix it?

                             FERMAT

               Yea- Maybe, but I'll need something 

               to solder with.

                             ALAN

               We're in the middle of nowhere Fermat, 

               where are you going to find something 

               like that. (Tintin

               and Fermat see Alan's retainer and share a look) What?

               Alan yells as Tintin and Fermat pull out the metal part of Alan's 

               retainer.

                             ALAN

               Ow!

                             FERMAT

               Perfect.

                             TINTIN

               Gee Alan, I never figured you for a 

               crybaby.

                             ALAN

               I'm gonna kill you.

                             FERMAT

               What'd he say?

                             TINTIN

               I think it was some sort of apology.

                             FERMAT

               I got it, yes! Y-y-you the man, Fermat! 

               Okay, first step is to establish contact 

               with Thunderbird

               5.

               Scene switch to Thunderbird 5

                             ALAN

               Dad?

                             JOHN

               It's Alan!

                             JEFF

               Alan, where are you? Are you safe?

                             ALAN

               I'm at the satellite relay station with 

               Fermat and Tintin. Fermat's gonna hack 

               into the main

               computer system and give control of Thunderbird 5 back to you.

                             JEFF

               We're standing by.

                             FERMAT

               Okay, we're almost there.

               Scene switches to Command and Control room with Transom and Brains.

                             TRANSOM

               Goodness me, Professor. You're so good-looking 

               without your glasses on. I think you 

               may

               find that's another thing we have in common. Pretty? (She leans 

               in to kiss him, but an alarm sounds at

               the control panel)

                             TRANSOM

               Oh now that's not fair. Just when things 

               were starting to sizzle.

                             TRANSOM

               (To the Hood as he walks in) A burst 

               of transmission from the island's satellite 

               station.

               Should I jam it?

                             THE HOOD

               And give Mullion the coordinates.

               Scene switches to Mullion and the two guards in a car. Transom 

               is communicating with him through

               his headset.

                             TRANSOM

               Take the main track southeast, then 

               head up Satellite Hill.

               Scene switches back to the kids at the satellite station.

                             FERMAT

               They're onto us! We're being jammed!

                             ALAN

               Can you finish?

                             FERMAT

               I'll try.

                             JEFF

               (Through the video phone) Alan, what's 

               happening?

                             ALAN

               Hang in there Dad, one more minute, 

               okay?

                             FERMAT

               It's not going to work Alan. The signal's 

               too weak for data transmission.

                             ALAN

               Dad, can you hear me? They're jamming 

               the signal. We're going to lose you. 

               Don't worry, I'll

               take care of everything, okay?

                             JEFF

               That's a negative! It's too dangerous. 

               Follow emergency procedure. Wait for 

               Lady Penelope at the

               rendezvous point. Alan can you read me? (the screen begins to 

               break up)

                             ALAN

               Dad!

                             JEFF

               Alan we're losing you! Alan!

                             ALAN

               Dad!

               Alan throws the video phone

                             FERMAT

               No!

                             ALAN

               Useless!

                             FERMAT

               It is now.

                             TINTIN

               I'm sorry, Alan. This is hard on all 

               of us.

                             ALAN

               No, it's okay. I'm fine.

                             FERMAT

               You don't have to be such a tough guy 

               Alan. I'm worried about my dad too.

                             TINTIN

               I'd do anything to be with my parents 

               right now.

                             ALAN

               But The Hood knows we're alive now. 

               We have to go.

                             FERMAT

               Even worse, they know exactly

               Tires screech and Mullion and the guards appear.

                             FERMAT

               Where we are!

               Mullion and the other guards watch the kids running down the 

               hillside for a second.

                             MULLION

               Come on!

               The kids fall down a ditch screaming and into a river.

                             FERMAT

               Great, more water.

                             ALAN

               Tintin, can you slow 'em down?

                             TINTIN

               I'd be delighted.

                             ALAN

               Then do it. And meet us at the junk 

               yard. Come on, Fermat.

               Scene changes to Alan and Fermat discovering a hoversled in the 

               junkyard.

                             ALAN

               This'll get us out of here.

               Scene change to Mullion hunting Tintin down in the forest.

                             MULLION

               There! Come on!

               Tintin looks up and sees a bees hive.

                             MULLION

               Straight ahead.

               Tintin uses a limb to hit the bee hive at Mullion and the other 

               two guards. Mullion falls off the car

               and into a puddle while being stung by bees. The scene cuts back 

               to Alan and Fermat in the junkyard

               attaching something to the back of the hoversled so that all 

               three of them can fit on it.

                             FERMAT

               It's gonna make this thing hard to control 

               you know.

                             ALAN

               No problem.

                             FERMAT

               You really must be careful not to exceed 

               four bars of boost or else

                             ALAN

               I said no problem.

                             TINTIN

               Guys, let's go we've got to get out 

               of here. What is this?

                             FERMAT

               It's a hoversled.

                             ALAN

               It's our ticket out, unless you've got 

               a better idea.

                             TINTIN

               Yeah, let's wait for Lady Penelope, 

               like your dad said.

                             FERMAT

               (Hands Tintin the seat to the hoversled) 

               Here.

                             ALAN

               Great plan. Let's sit and wait to get 

               caught. I say we do something. Now! 

               Right, Fermat?

                             FERMAT

               Actually, I agree with Tintin. I don't 

               think this is s-s-safe.

                             ALAN

               You don't think anything is s s-safe.

                             FERMAT

               Just because I s-s-stutter doesn't mean 

               that I'm wrong. If we're a team, we 

               should make

               decisions as a team.

                             ALAN

               Do you guys want to sit here and take 

               a vote? Or do you want to get out of 

               here? Cuz I'm going.

                             TINTIN

               You can be a real jerk sometimes.

               Scene changes to Mullion looking up and seeing the kids escaping 

               on the hoversled.

                             MULLION

               (To the guards driving the car) Go! 

               Go!

                             TINTIN

               (After looking behind her and seeing 

               Mullion and the other guards in the 

               car getting closer to

               them) Oh, no!

                             MULLION

               Come on! Faster!

                             FERMAT

               Alan! You're going too fast!

                             ALAN

               I need more speed to get above the trees. 

               Hang on!

               Tintin and Fermat fall off the hoversled screaming and at Mullion's 

               feet.

                             ALAN

               What'd I tell you guys? (looks down 

               and sees Fermat and Tintin being captured.) 

               Oh, no.

               Scene switches to Mullion walking Tintin and Fermat to a door 

               in the Tracy house.

                             TINTIN

               What are you doing?

                             FERMAT

               Oh, no! Not the fridge!

               Fridge door opens to reveal Kyrano, Onaha, and Brains.

                             ONAHA

               Tintin!

                             BRAINS

               Hey son.

                             KYRANO

               Sweetheart, are you okay?

                             TINTIN

               I'm fine, Dad.

                             MULLION

               (Grabs Fermat away from Brains and has 

               him sit down on a container) Cool off, 

               kid! (he

               laughs evilly as he walks out of the fridge and closes the door 

               on the way out)

               Scene switch to Park and Lady Penelope approaching Tracy Island.

                             PARKER

               approaching Tracy Island.

                             THE HOOD

               What is it?

                             TRANSOM

               We have an unidentified craft approaching 

               the island at high speed.

               Scene switches to Alan climbing over a hill and seeing Lady Penelope's 

               car approaching.

               Stop it!

                             GORDON

               Come on, Dad. The situation's hopeless.

                             JEFF

               No, it's not. There's still time. We've 

               got people on the ground working for 

               us.

                             GORDON

               Alan? He's just a kid!

                             JEFF

               He's a Tracy.

               Scene switches quickly to Alan running through the forest and

                             PARKER

               No, milady.

                             LADY PENELOPE

               That bougainvillea is absolutely parched, 

               and someone should do something about

               that hideous hammock.

                             THE HOOD

               (After seeing Lady Penelope and Parker) 

               Whom do we have here? Mullion.

                             MULLION

               I must warn you that I know judo, krai 

               magna, and tae kwon do.

                             LADY PENELOPE

               And I know Parker.

                             PARKER

               Milady.

                             MULLION

               (After Parker punches him in the face) 

               You've broken my nose.

                             PARKER

               Yes, that was very much the intention 

               of the maneuver.

                             TRANSOM

               (After she tries to attack Lady Penelope 

               and Lady Penelope pushes her over) Whoa!

                             LADY PENELOPE

               One tries so hard in life to sort things 

               out on an intellectual-slash-conversational 

               level.

               sometimes it's just not possible.

               Lady Penelope continues to fight Transom and Parker continues 

               to fight Mullion, the Hood is watching

               them.

                             PARKER

               (after Mullion threw him against a metal 

               cabinet) Shall I bring the car around, 

               milady?

                             LADY PENELOPE

               Parker, have a bit of a lie-down.

                             PARKER

               (Sees Mullion behind Lady Penelope) 

               Excuse me, milady. (punches him and 

               after that has no

               effect he picks up a frying pan and hits Mullion)

               Transom goes back to fighting Lady Penelope and Mullion is fighting 

               Parker.

                             THE HOOD

               Ah, Lady Penelope! Of course he has 

               his palace. Why not his princess?

                             LADY PENELOPE

               Flattery will get you nowhere. (after 

               she blocks the metal bar that Transom 

               was trying

               to hit her with) Ow! Have you any idea what a manicure costs 

               these days?

                             PARKER

               (Is pushing Mullion forward) Coming 

               through, milady.

               The camera quickly pans a little bit outside to show Alan hidden 

               behind some shrubs watching the

               fight.

                             PARKER

               (After the Hood uses his powers to throw 

               a sofa at them) Duck, milady!

                             ALAN

               He's weak. Using his power makes him 

               weak. (The Hood, having heard something 

               looks over

               toward where Alan)

                             THE HOOD

               You're formidable opponent Lady Penelope. 

               More than a match for most men.

                             LADY PENELOPE

               That's not saying much, then, is it?

                             THE HOOD

               (uses his powers to stop the punch that 

               Parker was about to throw at him) I 

               suggest you

               let us pass.

                             LADY PENELOPE

               Don't try your parlor games on me you 

               sad, little man. You've committed a 

               serious

               crime trespassing on this island. And in about (looks at Parker's 

               watch) four seconds, I'm going to get

               quite cross with you. (the Hood uses his powers to stop her foot 

               which was about to come up and kick

               him.)

                             THE HOOD

               (with his back still to Alan) How are 

               you, Alan? (he uses his powers on Parker 

               and Lady

               Penelope and they cry out in pain) (Alan moves to run back into 

               the jungle) I hope you don't think I'm

               going to chase you. (he uses his powers on Parker and Lady Penelope 

               and they cry out in pain again)

               You can make it stop, Alan. (Parker and Lady Penelope cry out 

               again) You have something that belongs

               to me.

                             PARKER

               Really, sir, don't mind me. This isn't 

               the first time my head's been pulverized. 

               And it's never

               done any real harm before. (The Hood once again uses his powers 

               on them and they cry out in pain

               louder this time)

                             ALAN

               (comes out of his hiding place) Stop! 

               Stop! I'll give it to you. (throws the 

               guidance processor

               toward the pool) Fetch! (the Hood uses his powers to bring it 

               over to him before it can hit the water)

                             THE HOOD

               You made a match of it, Alan, I'll give 

               you that. (to Mullion and Transom) Put 

               them with the

               others. (Transom grabs Parker)

                             MULLION

               (To Lady Penelope and Alan) You're coming 

               with me. (Grabs Alan's arms and throws 

               Lady

               Penelope over his shoulder)

                             LADY PENELOPE

               Put me down! This outfit is couture.

               Scene switches to Thunderbird 5.

                             JEFF

               Don't go to sleep. John, look at me. 

               Keep your eyes open.

               Scene switches back to the fridge where Mullion and Transom are 

               taking Alan, Lady Penelope, and

               Parker.

                             MULLION

               You need to cool off, milady.

                             TINTIN

               Lady Penelope!

                             LADY PENELOPE

               (To Mullion) Big oaf! (The fridge door 

               closes leaving them trapped) Right, 

               that's quite

               enough losing for one day.

                             ALAN

               (To Fermat) So, how does it feel to 

               be right all the time?

                             FERMAT

               Not b-bad, actually.

                             ALAN

               I'm so sorry, Fermat.

                             FERMAT

               We make quite a pair. It's hard for 

               me to t-t-talk. It's hard for you to 

               l-l-listen.

                             LADY PENELOPE

               Parker, I have an idea.

                             PARKER

               Excellent, milady.

                             LADY PENELOPE

               Brains, how long do Jeff and the boys 

               have?

                             BRAINS

               I can't think. I'm too c-c-cold.

               Scene switches to Transom, Mullion, and The Hood in Thunderbird 

               2 about to leave Tracy Island.

                             TRANSOM

               The guidance processor has been installed.

                             TRANSOM

               Thunderbird 2 is ready for takeoff.

                             THE HOOD

               What is our ETA?

                             MULLION

               Under an hour. Bank of London, here 

               we come!

               Scene changes back to the fridge.

                             ALAN

               We've got to be quick. The Hood's getting 

               away.

                             PARKER

               In position, milady.

                             LADY PENELOPE

               Here we go.

                             FEMALE COMPUTER VOIC

               Launch sequence, stage two. (Lady Penelope 

               kicks her shoe at an icicle

               which falls and cuts through the ropes tying Parker's hands together.)

                             ALAN

               Yes!

                             PARKER

               Good shot, milady.

                             LADY PENELOPE

               (As they are untying everyone) Come 

               on, Parker. Let's give the bad guys 

               a good

               thrashing!

               Scene switches back to Thunderbird 2 launching

               Stage three.

               Scene changes back to the fridge.

                             PARKER

               (trying to figure out how to open the 

               door) This seems to be a six-lever mortise, 

               milady.

                             LADY PENELOPE

               I love it when your checkered past comes 

               in handy Parker.

                             PARKER

               Thank you, milady. Unfortunately, I 

               fear I shall need a piece of wire to 

               access the mechanism.

               (Lady Penelope's hand goes up shirt to get her bra wire and everyone 

               turns around)

                             LADY PENELOPE

               Will this suffice, Parker?

                             PARKER

               Most certainly, milady.

                             LADY PENELOPE

               I didn't actually need it, anyway.

                             PARKER

               Of course not, milady. (Parker gets 

               the door open)

                             FERMAT

               Quick! They're getting away

                             ALAN

               Okay, everyone get to the control room.

                             FERMAT

               (Hands Parker his hat) Hat.

               Scene switches to everyone running into the Command and Control 

               room

                             FERMAT

               Get in there quick, Fermat, and save 

               my family. Then we'll get The Hood. 

               Good luck!

                             FERMAT

               Looks like they slipped a backdoor key 

               into the access codes.

                             BRAINS

               I'll follow your lead, son.

                             LADY PENELOPE

               (Using the video phone to talk with 

               Thunderbird 5) Thunderbird 5 come in.

               Thunderbird 5 come in.

                             ALAN

               How long have they got before re-entry?

                             FERMAT

               90 seconds and counting

                             FERMAT

               I'm in!

                             ALAN

               Good job, Fermat.

                             FERMAT

               Okay, I just need someone on their end 

               to confirm the access protocol.'

                             BRAINS

               Thunderbird 5 come in.

                             ALAN

               Dad, come on are we coming through?

                             BRAINS

               Mr. Tracy, can you hear me? Come in.

                             LADY PENELOPE

               Thunderbird 5 come in.

                             ALAN

               Dad, come on!

                             BRAINS

               Mr. Tracy, can you hear me? Come in.

                             ALAN

               Dad!

                             BRAINS

               Thunderbird 5 come in.

                             ALAN

               How long have they got?

                             FERMAT

               45 seconds until re-entry.

                             BRAINS

               Damn it, Jeff! Wake up!

                             JEFF

               I think that's the first time you've 

               ever called me by my first name, Brains. 

               Thanks for waking me.

                             ALAN

               Dad!

                             JEFF

               Alan! Well done.

                             FERMAT

               Mr. Tracy, confirm access protocol.

                             JOHN

               Confirmed. We are back online.

                             BRAINS

               Gravity is restored. Put Thunderbird 

               f-f- your craft into geostational orbit 

               immediately.

                             JEFF

               FAB, Brains.

                             JEFF

               Looks like we're good to go.

                             ALAN

               Dad, are you all right?

                             JEFF

               We're fine. We still have a job to do. 

               Where's The Hood?

                             BRAINS

               He's in Thunderbird 2 Mr. Tracy headed 

               for L-L-L

                             LADY PENELOPE

               London.

                             BRAINS

               She's right.

                             ALAN

               He's got the Mole on board.

               Looks like Thunderbird 3 lost a booster, 

               Dad. We'll never get there in time.

                             ALAN

               Let me go after The Hood. He'll destroy 

               everything you've built everything the 

               Thunderbirds stand

               for.

                             JEFF

               Negative. I'm sorry it's too risky.

                             ALAN

               I can do this. You know I can. What 

               am I saying? (Puts his arms around Tintin 

               and Fermat) We

               can do this.

                             JEFF

               Okay, Alan. We'll meet you there. Thunderbirds

               I know The Hood's weakness, Fermat. 

               I can stop him if we get there in time.

                             FERMAT

               Stand by. We're going to maximum thrust.

               Thunderbird 2 lands in a park near the London Eye and causes 

               panic.

                             CHUCK

               We're getting reports of some kind of 

               incident in London involving the Thunderbirds. 

               Lisa, are

               you there?

                             LISA LOWE

               Chuck, I'm here in Jubilee Gardens where 

               Thunderbird 2 has made an impromptu 

               landing,

               causing total panic in Central London. As far as we know there 

               has been no emergency call from this

               area so it's unclear why Thunderbird 2 would be active here at 

               all. I don't know if you can see this Chuck

               but Thunderbird 2 seems to be unloading some kind of machine.

               Scene changes to inside the Mole with Transom, Mullion, and The 

               Hood.

                             TRANSOM

               Sir, if we continue on our present course, 

               we'll sever the monorail's subterranean 

               supports.

               Shall I correct our position?

                             THE HOOD

               Stay on course.

                             TRANSOM

               But sir, we'll cause a major disaster.

                             THE HOOD

               No, we won't. The Thunderbirds will.

               The Mole severs the subterranean support leaving one monorail 

               car stranded in the air. Scene then

                             THE HOOD

               Finish her off, Mullion.

                             LADY PENELOPE

               Shame on you. I always despise a man 

               who delegates the important jobs. (sees 

               the

               look Mullion is giving her) Oh, dream on, sad act. (Mullion chuckles 

               and walks away.)

               Scene switches to Jeff, Alan, Tintin, and Fermat about to enter 

               the Bank of London when Parker pulls

               up.

                             JEFF

               Good timing, Parker.

                             PARKER

               Good afternoon Mr. Tracy.

                             JEFF

               Come with us.

                             PARKER

               My pleasure, Mr. Tracy.

               Scene switches to The Hood talking to Mullion and Transom.

                             THE HOOD

               The Thunderbirds. They're here. Kill 

               them all.

               Scene switches to Jeff, Alan, Parker, Tintin, and Fermat inside 

               the Bank of London.

                             JEFF

               Alan, you guys stay here with Parker. 

               I'm gonna go find Lady Penelope.

                             ALAN

               But what about The Hood? (Alan points 

               behind Parker) Look out, Parker! (When 

               Parker turns

               away Alan runs after his dad.)

                             PARKER

               Master Tracy!

                             FERMAT

               Look out, Parker!

                             PARKER

               Alright, that's enough of that.

                             MULLION

               (from behind Parker) Don't move. (Parker 

               motions for the kids to run forward 

               but Transom

               blocks them. Parker puts his hands up as if to punch her)

                             TRANSOM

               Go on, then.

                             PARKER

               No, sorry. I can't hit a lady.

                             TINTIN

               Allow me. (she kick Transom and runs 

               off, Transom chases her)

                             MULLION

               (To Fermat) I've been waiting to get 

               my hands on you brats.

                             PARKER

               And I've been waiting to get my hands 

               on you.

               They brawl for a few seconds before Mullion lands a good punch 

               on Parker.

                             PARKER

               Ow, now that was a punch.

                             FERMAT

               Parker, can we wrap this up?

                             PARKER

               What did you have in mind, Master Hackenbacker?

                             FERMAT

               Strategically speaking, the best odds 

               of success lie with the Parker Haymaker.

                             PARKER

               I concur. (they knock Mullion out)

               Scene changes to Jeff running into the room that Lady Penelope 

               is being held captive in

                             JEFF

               Penny!

                             PENNY

               Jeff, no!

                             THE HOOD

               Did you save them all this time, Jeff? 

               Or did you leave someone behind?

                             JEFF

               I didn't make you what you are.

                             THE HOOD

               It's not me you have to convince. (motions 

               his head toward the entrance of the 

               room

               where Alan is standing)

                             JEFF

               Leave my son out of this- (the Hood 

               uses his powers to throw Jeff into the 

               cage that Lady

               Penelope is handcuffed in)

                             LADY PENELOPE

               Jeff!

                             ALAN

               Dad! (Alan runs toward the closing cage 

               door and reaches it right as it slams 

               shut) Dad! Dad!

                             THE HOOD

               I'm disappointed in you, Alan. I thought 

               we were kindred spirits.

                             ALAN

               Well, we're not. I'm Jeff Tracy's son.

                             THE HOOD

               You certainly are. (Alan runs at him)

                             JEFF

               No!

                             LADY PENELOPE

               Alan no! (The Hood uses his powers to 

               throw Alan off to the side where he 

               slams

               into a wall)

                             JEFF

               Alan!

               The Hood looks dazed but then uses his powers to fly up to the 

               catwalk above the Mole. The scene

               then switches to Tintin being chased by Transom running into 

               a cage.

                             TRANSOM

               Come here, you little minx! (Tintin 

               jumps up on a bar and flips to the other 

               side while

               Transom runs into the wall) Ow!

                             TINTIN

               (Closing the cage door) Bye-bye.

               Scene switches back to the room with The Hood, Alan, Jeff, and 

               Lady Penelope.

                             JEFF

               Alan, stay back.

                             THE HOOD

               You want so desperately to walk in Daddy's 

               footsteps. (uses his powers to lift 

               Alan off the

               floor and makes him start choking himself with his own hands)

                             JEFF

               Let him go.

                             THE HOOD

               Did you really think you could challenge 

               me?

                             JEFF

               Let him go, please.

                             LADY PENELOPE

               Let him go.

                             JEFF

               Please! Let him go! (the Hood tightens 

               his hold of Alan and then releases him)

                             LADY PENELOPE

               Alan! Are you all right?

                             JEFF

               Alan, get out. Run!

                             ALAN

               He's getting weaker. He can't last much 

               longer.

                             JEFF

               Neither can you! (Alan begins to climb 

               up the Mole to reach the Hood) Alan, 

               no! Look out! (The

               Hood starts the Mole with his powers and Alan has to jump and 

               grab the railing of the catwalk) Alan!

                             THE HOOD

               I'm glad you could be here to see this, 

               Jeff. (steps on one of Alan's hands 

               until he cries in

               pain and lets go)

                             THE HOOD

               Goodbye, Alan! (Steps on the other hand 

               and Alan yells in pain) (Tintin runs 

               into the room)

                             TINTIN

               No!

                             THE HOOD

               Ah, (uses his powers on her) (She uses 

               her powers on him as well) Oh!

               (The catwalk flips over making Alan safely on top and the Hood 

               dangling above the still active Mole.

                             THE HOOD

               Leave me, Alan. Leave me to die. (releases 

               one hand from the railing) Like your 

               father did.

                             ALAN

               I don't want to save your life. (the 

               Hood lets his other hand go, but Alan 

               grabs it) But it's what we

               do.

               Scene switches to The Hood, Mullion, and Transom being led to 

               a police car outside the Bank of

               London when Thunderbirds 1,2, and 3 fly above them.

                             THE HOOD

               See you soon, Jeff.

                             PARKER

               (To Lady Penelope as she climbs in the 

               car) Now, that was definitely showing 

               off.

               Scene changes to back at Tracy Island. Scott, Virgil, John, and 

               Gordon are playing in the pool. Jeff is

               grilling with Lady Penelope standing next to him. Fermat is getting 

               swimming lessons from his dad

               and Alan is watching.

                             VIRGIL

               Hey, Scott.

                             SCOTT

               Get him!

                             LADY PENELOPE

               (To Jeff) What did you put in these 

               margaritas?

                             JEFF

               It's a Tracy secret.

                             BRAINS

               (To Fermat) That's my boy! One more 

               week and you're gonna be swimming like 

               a F-f-f-D-d-d-

               Sha-sha- sha-Aquatic creature.

                             ALAN

               Good job, Ferm.

                             TINTIN

               (To Alan as she spins around) So, what 

               do you think?

                             ALAN

               He's getting there. (Looks at Tintin) 

               Whoa, Tintin! You're just really, um, 

               blossoming.

                             TINTIN

               Ew! Did you say "blossoming"? (smiles 

               at him)

                             JEFF

               (rings a triangle) Gather around everybody. 

               I have an announcement to make. Tonight 

               is a special

               night. We're all together because of three very special people. 

               Fermat, Tintin, Alan. The world needs

               Thunderbirds and the Thunderbirds need you. (gives each of them 

               International Rescue pins)

                             FERMAT

               Mr. Tracy!

                             TINTIN

               Thank you, sir. (Camera pans quickly 

               over to Parker who is tearing up)

                             JEFF

               Congratulations, Alan. No short cuts. 

               You earned it. You all did.

                             PARKER

               (To Onaha and Kyrano) I'm not usually 

               an emotional man, but sometimes even 

               the toughest

               nut must crack.

                             VIRGIL

               (As all four of Alan's brothers walk 

               over to ruffle his hair and congratulate 

               him) Hey, way to go,

               sprout!

                             JOHN

               That's my boy, Alan! That's my brother. 

               (Fermat and Alan are thrown into the 

               pool by Scott,

               John, Virgil, and Gordon who jump in after them)

                             JEFF

               (answering his phone after it rings) 

               Yes, Madam President. I see. Of course, 

               straightaway. Boys.

               Sorry, Penny. Duty calls.

                             LADY PENELOPE

               Of course it does. And quite right too.

               Scene switches to all five Tracy boys lined up in their uniforms 

               about to go on a rescue mission. The

               older four are looking at Alan.

                             JEFF

               Thunderbirds are go!

               Scene switches to Lady Penelope and Parker in a pink pedal boat

                             LADY PENELOPE

               Fast as you can, Parker.

                             PARKER

               Certainly, milady.

               Credits Roll with music by Busted playing in the background

                             BUSTED

               Thunderbirds Are Go

               Spring breaks come around and there's more heroes to be found.

               There's something major going down on Tracy island, island.

               You know that you'd just be a fool to be a bad guy (bad guy) 

               Cause now the boys are back in town no strings to hold them down

               Thunderbirds are go,

               Thunderbirds are, Thunderbirds are go

               Thunderbirds are, Thunderbirds are go
