          FROM THE BLACK WE HEAR--

                         MARK (V.O.)

          Did you know there are more people with

          genius IQ's living in China than there

          are people of any kind living in the

          United States?

                         ERICA (V.O. )

          That can't be true.

                         MARK (V.O.)

          it is true.

                         ERICA (V.O.)

          What would account for that?

                         MARK (V.0.)

          Well first of all, a lot of people live

          in China. But here's my question:

                         FADE IN

          INT. CAMPUS BAR - NIGHT

          MARK ZUCKERBERG is a sweet looking 19 year old whose lack of

          any physically intimidating attributes masks a very

          complicated and dangerous anger. He has trouble making eye

          contact- and sometimes it's hard to tell if he's talking to you

          or to himself.

          ERICA, also 19, is Mark's date. She has a girl-next-door face

          that makes her easy to fall for. At this point in the

          conversation she already knows that she'd rather not be there

          and her politeness is about to be tested.

          The scene is stark and simple.

                         MARK

          How do you distinguish yourself in a

          population of people who all got 1600 on

          their SAT's?

                         ERICA

          I didn't know they take SAT's in China.

                         MARK

          I wasn't talking about China anymore, I

          was talking about here.

                         ERICA

          You got 1600?

                         MARK

          You can sing in an a Capella group.

          2.

                         BRICA

          Does that mean that you actually got

          nothing wrong?

                         MARK

          Or you row crew or you invent a 25 dollar

          PC.

                         ERICA

          Or you get into a final club.

                         MARK

          Or you get into a final club, exactly.

                         ERICA

          I like guys who row crew.

                         MARK

                         (BEAT)

          Well I can't do that. And yes, it means I

          got nothing wrong on the test.

                         ERICA

          Have you ever tried?

                         MARK

          I'm trying now.

                         ERICA

          To row crew?

                         MARK

          To get into a final club. To row crew?

          No. Are you, like--whatever--crazy?

                         ERICA

          Sometimes, Mark-seriously-YOU say two

          things at once and I'm not sure which one

          we're talking about.

                         MARK

          But you've seen guys who row crew, right?

                         ERICA

          No.

                         MARK

          Okay, well.. they're bigger than me.

          They're world class athletes. And a

          second ago you said you like guys who row

          crew so I assumed you'd met one.

                         ERICA

          I guess I meant I liked the idea of it.

          The way a girl likes cowboys.

          3.

                         MARK

          The Phoenix is good.

                         ERICA

          This is a new topic?

                         MARK

          It's the same topic.

                         ERICA

          We're still talking about the finals

          clubs?

                         MARK

          Would you rather talk about something

          else?

                         ERICA

          It's just that since the beginning of

          the conversation about finals clubs I

          think I may have had a birthday.

                         MARK

          We can change the subject.

          ERICA.

          (can't get over it)

          There are more people in China with genius

          IQ's than the entire population of--

                         MARK

          It's about exclusivity.

                         T'RICA

          .....what is?

                         MARK

          The final clubs. And that's how you

          distinguish yourself. The Phoenix is the

          most diverse. The Fly Club, Roosevelt

          punched the Porc.

                         ERICA

          Which one?

                         MARK

          The Porcellian, the Porc, it's the best

          of the best.

                         ERICA

          I actually meant which Roosevelt.

                         MARK

          Theodore.

          4.

                         ERICA

          Okay, well, which is the easiest one to

          get into?

          MARK takes a cigarette from a pack, lights it, takes a drag

          and blows the smoke out before he says...

                         MARK

          Hm.

                         ERICA

          What?

                         MARK

          why would you ask me that?

                         ERICA

          I was just asking.

                         MARK

          They're all hard to get into. My friend

          Eduardo made $300,000 betting on oil

          futures last summer and he won't get in.

          Money or the ability to make it doesn't

          impress anybody around here. Everybody

          can do that.

                         ERICA

          He made $300,000 in a summer?

                         MARK

          He likes meteorology.

                         ERICA

          You said it was oil futures.

                         MARK

          If you can predict the weather you can

          predict the price of heating oil. You

          asked me that because you think the final

          club that's easiest to get into is the

          one where I'll have the best chance,

                         ERICA

                         (BEAT)

          I've lost my place again.

                         MARK

          You asked me which one was the easiest to

          get into because you think that's where I

          have the best chance.

                         ERICA

          The one that's easiest to get into would

          be the one where anybody had the best

          chance.

          S.

                         MARK

          I just think you asked--the placement of

          where you asked the question--

                         ERICA

          I was honestly just asking. Okay? I was

          asking just to ask. Mark, I'm not

          speaking in code.

                         MARK

          Erica--

                         ERICA

          You're obsessed with the finals clubs.

          You have finals clubs OCD and you need to

          see someone about this who'll prescribe

          some sort of medication. You don't care

          if side effects may include blindness,

          okay, just do it.

                         MARK

          Final clubs. Not finals clubs and there's

          a difference between being obsessed and

          being motivated.

                         ERICA

          Yes there is.

                         MARK

          Well you do--that was cryptic--so you do

          speak in code.

                         ERICA

          I didn't mean to be cryptic.

                         MARK

          I'm saving I need to do something

          substantial in order to get the attention

          of the clubs.

                         ERICA

          Why?

                         MARK

          Because they're exclusive.

                         (BEAT)

          And fun and they lead to a better life.

                         ERICA

          You think Teddy Roosevelt got elected

          president because he was a member of the

          Phoenix Club?

                         MARK

          He was a member of the Porcellian and yes

          I do.

          6.

                         ERICA

          Maybe he sang in an a Capella group.

                         MARK

          I want to be straight forward and tell

          you that I think you should be a lot more

          supportive. If I get in I'll be taking

          you to the parties and you'll be meeting

          people that you wouldn't normally get to

          meet.

                         ERICA

                         (SMILES)

          You would do that for me?

                         MARK

          You're my girlfriend.

                         ERICA

          okay, well I want to be straight forward

          and tell you that I'm not anymore.

                         MARK

                         (BEAT)

          What do you mean?

                         ERICA

          I'm not your girlfriend anymore,

                         MARK

          Is this a joke?

                         ERICA

          No, I'm sorry, it's not.

                         MARK

          You're breaking up with me?

                         ERICA

          You're going to introduce me to people I

          wouldn't normally get to meet? What the

          fuck is that supposed to mean?

                         MARK

          Take it easy.

                         ERICA

          What was it supposed to mean?

                         MARK

          It was--Erica, the reason we're able to

          sit here and drink is that you used to

          sleep with the door guy.

                         (PAUSE)

          I want to really try not to lose it now.

          you to know, from the bottom of my heart,

          that that won't be true. It'll be because

          Along with the MUSIC, we slowly push in on MARK. A fuse has

          just been lit.

          As MARK continues on, he passes a group of people heading in

          preparations under way for the hottest party on campus

          We start on a good looking STUDENT fixing his tie in the

          bathroom mirror. He walks out of the bathroom and into the

          main area where he's immediately tossed a bottle of champagne

          by a similarly dressed STUDENT. We see that there are a

          couple of dozen other guys around. Our guy takes the champagne

          bottle and sticks it on the bar, which is being stocked by two

          sexy FEMALE uniformed BARTENDERS.

          Our guy walks past P. DJ's table where the DJ is setting up his

          incredibly high-end equipment.

          Our guy trots down a set of mahogany and red-carpet stairs,

          opens a heavy door and looks out to the sidewalk.

          A BOUNCER in a tuxedo is standing by a velvet rope which is

          It's three years later and MARK is sitting with his LAWYERS at

          a large conference table.

          23.

          MARK is wearing a hoodie, sweatpants and Adidas flip-flops--a

          personal uniform that we'll come to understand. And while it

          may take us a while to notice it, MARK's a different person in

          these flash-forward scenes. Still tortured and complicated,

          but comfortable now with his own power.

          His lawyer is SY, who's accompanied by some junior associates,

          one of whom--a pleasant, pretty and professional young

          contemporary of Mark's named MARYLIN, we'll get to know.

           On the other side are EDUARDO and his lawyer, GRETCHEN, also

          a. a mpanied by some associates. A STENOGRAPHER is typing the

          recor..

          The room is glass on two sides and through the windows we can

          see the behemoths of Silicon valley--Oracle, SunMicrosystems,

          Google, etc.

          GRETCHEN is taking MARK's deposition.

                         GRETCHEN

          So you were called in front of the Ad

          Board.

                         MARK

          That's not what happened.

          No, back, I mean--That's--back at the bar

          Why don't we stretch our legs a minute,

          can we do that? It's been almost three

          hours and frankly you did spend an awful

          lot of time embarrassing Mr. Zuckerberg

          with the girl's testimony in the bar.

                         MART

          I'm not embarrassed, it's just that she

          made a lot of that up.

                         GRETCHEN

          She was under oath.

                         MARK

          Then I guess that would be the first time

          somebody's lied under oath.

          People are stretching and getting coffee and talking quietly.

          They had open water after a hundred

          meters. I don't think we're gonna catch

          'em today.

           And we PULL BACK TO REVEAL that there's a fourth boat which is

          already five boat, ngths ahead of the other three.

                         3-1

          The fourth boat is being crewed by CAMERON and TYLER

          WINKLEVOSS----identical twins who stepped out of an ad for

          Abercrombie and Fitch.

          They know that the others aren't in their class and even

          though they're highly competitive athletes, they don't like

          showing anyone up, least of all their teammates.

                         CAMERON

          Is there anyway to make this a fair

          fight?

                         TYLER

          We could jump out and swim.

                         CAMERON

          I think we'd have to jump out and drown.

                         TYLER

          I'm not willing to do that.

                         CAMERON

          What are we at three-quarter power? Let's

          drop down to a half.

                         TYLER

          Or you could row forward and I could row

          backward.

                         CAMERON

          I'd kick your ass.

                         TYLER

          We're genetically identical, so biology

          and mathematics says we'd stay in one

          place not allowing for the current or the

          wind.

          You're being accused of intentionally

          breaching security, violating copyrights

          and violating individual privacy by

          creating the website, WWW.FACEMASH.COM.

          violation of the university's policy on

          distribution of digitized images. Before

          INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

          MARX is in his Operating Systems class. This is considered the

          hardest class at Harvard and MARK is one of the 50 students

          with their laptops open as the professor takes them through an

          impossibly difficult lesson,

                         PROFESSOR

          So let's look at a sample problem:

          Suppose we're given a computer with a 16-

          bit virtual address and a page size of

          256 bytes.

          A GIRL scribbles something on a piece of paper. Then hands it

          to the student next to her and nods that it should be passed

          over to MARK. While that's happening--

                         PROFESSOR (CONT'D)

          The system uses one-level page tables,

          which start at address 0x0400. Maybe you

          want to have DMA. on your 16-bit system,

          who knows? The first few pages are

          reserved for hardware flags, etc.

          MARK opens the note., It reads "Asshole".

          He looks over and sees a couple of GIRLS looking at him with

          contempt.

                         PROFESSOR (CONT'D)

          Assume page table entries have eight

          status bits.

          MARK closes his laptop, gets up and starts to head out of the

          hall.

                         PROFESSOR (CONT'D)

          The eight status bits would be--

                         (RE: MARK)

          And I see we have our first surrender.

          Don't worry, Mr. Zuckerberi12, brighter, men

          It's not that guys like me are generally

          Yeah.

          MARK opens up an e-mail and is writing a short message, then

          includes a link to the site--

          INT. CAMPUS PUB - NIGHT

          THE CROCODILLOS, Harvard's oldest male a Capella group, are

          singing at the front of the pub in their usual uniform of

          white tie and tails.

          Incongruously, but with surprisingly nice results, the group

          is covering a song from The Backstreet-Boys--"I Want it That

          Way"--and the pub full of students is loving it.

          We find a table in the back where DIVYA is sitting with some

          of his friends who are having a nice time. DIVYA's got his

          laptop open.

                         MALE FRIEND

          When did the Crocodillos start covering

          the Backstreet Boys? What happened to

          Cole Porter and Irving Berlin?

          56,

                         FEMALE FRIEND

          It's a Valentine's theme. They're singing

          love songs.

                         MALE FRIEND

          Good point, 'cause Cole Porter and Irving

          Berlin never wrote any love songs,

                         FEMALE FRIEND

          Divya, what are you reading?

                         DIVYA

          Seven different people spammed me the

          same link.

          We see DIVYA click his mouse on the link--

          What is it?

                         DIVYA

                         (DRYL Y)

          I don't know, but I'm really hoping it's

          video of kittens that look like the Marx

          Brothers 'cause I can never get enough

          file footage on my computer of animals

          doing...

          DIVYA trails off. We Slowly PUSH IN on his face as the blood

          starts draining away...

          I--uh...I have to go.

          DIVYA shuts his laptop, grabs it off the table and starts to

          bolt out of the pub. His foot gets caught on a chair leg and

          he falls hard face-first to the floor.

                         DIVYA (CONT'D)

          Shit.

          He starts out again, then comes back for his coat, grabs it;

          starts out and falls down all over again.

          Finally he's got it together and flies out of the pub and we

          57.

          They're focused and charging away in perfect sync when the

          door at the end of the century-old boathouse opens and DIVYA

          charges In from the co:Ld with his laptop and a copy of the

          Okay. I just wanted to let you know

          Zuckerberg stole our website.

          TYLER stops rowing and then CAMERON. They look at DIVYA...

                         DIVYA (CONT'D)

          Mark Zuckerberg stole our website. It's

          talking on the phone with his father and holding the Crimson.

          DIVYA's on his cell looking for MARK and TYLER, still in his

          practice clothes, has his desktop computer open to theFacebook

          waiting for? We met with Mark three

          times, we exchanged 52 e-mails, we can

          prove that he looked at the code, he'd

          seen what Victor had already done and we

          best friend for the money because he's

          The lamps in Harvard Yard light the snow falling.

                         SPEAKER (VO)

          The seminal event for me was when he was

          in Harvard Square and picked up a copy of

          Popular Electronics Magazine that ha the

          MITS Altair Kit on the cover.

          INT. AUDITORIUM -- SAME TIME

          There's a lower-level and a balcony and both are full.

          MARK and EDUARDO are sitting in the second to last row of the

          balcony.

          We'll hear the SPEAKER but we'll only get to see him in a

          slightly blurry image as our attention is on MARK and EDUARDO.

                         SPEAKER

          And it was a clear day, And I was up in

          my Radcliffe dorm. And he brought that up

          there and said, "Look, it's going to

          happen without us. We've got to do it

          now." And so I said..."Okay."

          He gets an appreciative LAUGH from the STUDENTS.

                         SPEAKER (CONT'D)

          Now the startingaof this industry was

          very humble indeed. The kit computer on

          the cover-of that magazine--

          We HEAR a little muffled giggling coming from the row behind

          MARK and EDUARDO, MARK is too into the speech to notice but

          the giggling registers as a slight annoyance on EDUARDO's

          face.

                         SPEAKER (CONT'D)

          --had an 8080 processor in it, and you

          had to assemble it yourself and it came

          with 256K of memory.

          EDUARDO hears the giggling again and turns around.

          In the row behind them and a few seats over are two beautiful

          Asian students.--ALICE and JENNY. They're a little overly made-

          up for a lecture. JENNY, the one sitting closest to EDUARDO,

          is wearing a short skirt with a white shirt: open one button

          too far down the front and we can see a hint of the red bra

          she's wearing underneath.

          Way cool. I'm Jenny. This is Alice.

          EDUARDO can't help noticing--just because it's in his line of

          sight--that down the row from the girls, someone else is

          pointing at them and whispering to a friend.

          Then back to the girls--

                         EDUARDO

                         (WHISPERING)

          is shoved in, followed by JENNY, who did the shoving. She's

          all over him as she presses him back against the divider.

          EDUARDO's hands are sliding under JENNY'S white shirt and

          finding the red bra when they hear a noise.

          Someone's gone into the next stall.

          JENNY keeps him pinned against the divider as she reaches down

          and unbuckles his belt.

          And then he hears another noise from the stall next door. A

          thump against the divider. JENNY's got his fly unzipped.

          EDUARDO looks down at the space between the stalls. He sees a

          pair of Adidas flip-flops.

          Then the sound of moaning, Before EDUARDO has time to say

          anything, JENNY pulls her shirt open, revealing the red bra,

          AMY grabs a towel and jumps out of the shower--

                         AMY (CONT'D)

          Where?:

          89.

                         SEAN

          Okay, there isn't a fire, but I need to

          ask you something.

                         AMY

          Are you kidding?!

                         SEAN

          No.

                         AMY

          I could have been killed!

                         SEAN

          What do you need to ask me?

                         SEAN

          I went to check my e-mail and there's a

          website open on your computer.

                         AMY

          Yeah. After you went unconscious last

          night I went on theFacebook for a while.

                         SEAN

          What's that?

                         AMY

          'iheFacebook? It. started at Harvard and

          standford's had it for about two weeks

          and it's awesome except it's addictive.

          Seriously, I'm on the thing five times a

          day, all my friends are.

                         SEAN

          You mind if I grab a piece of paper and a

          pen?

                         AMY

          What's wrong?

                         SEAN

          Absolutely nothing. It's beautiful.

                         AMY

          What are you talking about?

                         SEAN

                         CUT TO:

          INT. LARRY SUMMERS' OUTER OFFICE - DAY

          CAMERON and TYLER, in dark suits, are waiting to see the

          president of Harvard,

          The President's office is in one of the two oldest university

          buildings in the country, and the SECRETARY sitting at the

          desk i ven older. You get the sense that she thinks Harvard

          would be d -better place if it weren't for all, these students.

          She looks at them and the boys give her a polite smile and a

          small nod before she goes back to her work.

                         CAMERON

          (just making small talk)

          I've never been in this building.

                         SECRETARY

          (without really looking up)

          This building is a hundred years older

          than the country.it's in.

                         CAMERON

                         (THAT'S INTERESTING)

          Hm.

                         SECRETARY

          So do be careful.

                         TYLER

          We're just siting in the chairs.

                         SECRETARY

                         (INTO PHONE)

          Yes_.

                         (INTO PHONE)

          Very good.

          She hangs up the phone.

                         SECRETARY (CONT'D)

          You can go in now.

          She points to a door and CAMERON and TYLER get up, quickly

          straighten themselves, and walk into

          INT. SUMMERS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          LARRY SUMMERS, a large man, is on the phone at his desk in his

          well-appointed office. A fire crackles in the sitting area and

          a 40-ish African-American woman, ANNE, in a pants suit is

          nearby going over some papers.

          91.

          SUMMERS waves the boys in--

                         SUMMERS

                         (INTO PHONE)

          That's just their own stupidity, I should

          have been there.

                         (INTO PHONE)

          Darkness is the absence of light and

          stupidity in that instance was the

          absence of me.

          SUMMERS motions for them to sit and they do. They take in some

          of the photographs around the room---SUMMERS with BILL CtINTON,

          etc.

                         -SUMMERS (CONT'D)

                         (INTO PHONE)

          Catherine, I have students in my office

          now.

                         (INTO PHONE)

          Students.

                         (INTO PHONE)

          Under. grads.

                         (INTO PHONE)

          I don't know, from the looks of it I

          think they want to sell me sets of

          identical Brooks Brothers suits. We'll

          speak later.

          SUMMERS hangs up the phone--

                         SUMMERS (CONT'D)

          Good morning.

                         CAMERON

          Good morning, s_ir. I'm Cameron Winklevoss

          and this is my brother, Tyler.

          CAMERON is extending his hand but instead of taking it,

          SUMMERS reaches to the top of a pile of papers and pulls a ten-

          page letter off the top.

                         SUMMERS

          Why are you here?

          There's silence while SUMMERS appears to read over the

          letter...

                         SUMMERS (CONT'D)

          That wasn't rhetorical.

                         CAMERON

          I'm sorry, I thought you were reading the

          letter.

                         SUMMERS

          I've read the letter.

          92.

                         CAMERON

          Well I think it's pretty self-

          explanatory. We had an idea for a website

          called HarvardConnection--we've since

          changed the name to ConnectU--and Mark

          Zuckerberg stole that idea and--

                         SUMMERS

          What do you want me to do about it?

          CAMERON points to a row of Harvard Student Handbooks on the

          bookshelf behind SUMMERS.

                         CAMERON V

          Well sir, in The Harvard Student

          Handbook, which is distributed to each

          freshman--under the heading "Standards of

          Conduct in the Harvard Community" and the

          sub-heading, "Honesty"--

                         SUMMERS

          Oh dear God.

                         CAMERON

          --it says, "The College expects that all

          students will be honest and forthcoming

          in their dealings with members of this

          community. All students are required to

          respect private and public ownership.

          Instances of theft, misappropriation or

          unauthorized use of or damage to property

                         OR MATERIALS--

                         SUMMERS

          Excuse me, Anne?

                         ANNE

          Yes sir.,

                         SUMMERS

          Punch me in the face.

          (beat--then to CAMERON)

          Go ahead-.

                         CAMERON

                         (BEAT)

          --will result in disciplinary action,

          including the requirement to withdraw

          from the College." That's what is says in

          the handbook.

                         SUMMERS

          When did you memorize that?

                         TYLER

          (a little frustrated with this

                         BULLSHIT)

                         (MORE)

          93.

          TYLER (CONY ' D )

          Sir, it's against University rules to

          steal. from another student, plain and

          simple.

                         SUMMERS

          You've spoken to your R,A.?

                         CAMERON

          Yes sir, and the R.A. made a

          recommendation to the Ad Board but the Ad

          Board won't hear us.

                         SUMMERS

          Have you tried dealing with Mr.

          Zuck.e.rberg directly?

                         CAMERON

          Mr. Zuckerberg hasn't responded to any of

          our e-mails or phone calls for. the last'

          two weeks. He doesn't answer when we

          knock on his door at Kirkland and the

          closest we've come to talking face to

          face is when I saw him on. the quad and

          chased him through Harvard Square.

                         SUMMERS

          You chased him?

                         CAMERON

                         (BEAT)

          I saw him and I know he saw me and I

          started after him and he disappeared

                         SUMMERS

          You know he could have you arrested for

          harassment and attempted assault.

                         TYLER

                         (QUIETLY)

          This isn't happening.

                         SUMMERS

          I don't see this as a University issue.

                         TYLER

          Of course it's a University issue.

          There's a code of ethics and an honor

          code and he violated them both.

                         SUMMERS

          You entered into a code of ethics with

          the university, not with each other.

                         TYLER

                         (BEAT)

          I'm sorry President Summers, what you

          just said makes no sense to me at all.

          94,

                         SUMMERS

          I'm devastated by that.

                         CAMERON

          What my brother means is that if Mark

          Zuckerberg walked into our dorm room and

          stole our computer it would be a

          university issue, right?

                         SUMMERS

          I really don't know. This office doesn't

          handle petty larceny and the only reason

          I agreed to see you--Anne; by did I

          agree to see them?

                         ANNE

          Colleagues of their father.

                         SUMMERS

          So you see?

                         TYLER

          This isn't a petty larceny.

                         CAMERON

                         (CALMING)

                         TY--

                         TYLER

          This idea is potentially worth millions

          of dollars.

                         SUMMERS

          Millions of dollars?

                         CAMERON

          Yes.

                         SUMMERS

          You might be letting your imagination run

          away with you.

                         TYLER

          With all due respect I don't think you're

          in any position to make that call.

                         SUMMERS

          I was U.S. Treasury Secretary, I'm in

          some position to make that call.

                         TYLER

          Letting our imaginations run away with us

          is exactly what we were told to do in

          your freshmen address.

          95.

                         SUMMERS

          Well. I would try letting your-

          imaginations run away with you on a new

          project.

                         TYLER

          You would.

                         SUMMERS

          Everyone at Harvard is inventing

          something or starting a new business in

          their dorm room- Harvard undergraduates

          believe that inventing a job is better

          than getting one so can I suggest again

          that the two of you come up with a new

          new project?

                         CAMERON

          I'm sorry, but that-'s not the point, sir.

                         SUMMERS

          What's the point?

                         CAMERON

          You don't have to be an intellectual

          property expert to understand-the,

          difference between right and wrong.

                         SUMMERS

          And you're saying that I don't?

                         CAMERON

          Of course I'm not saying that.

                         TYLER

          I'm saying that.

          SUMMERS looks at TYLER and then smiles...

                         TYLER (CONT'D)

          Just start another project? Like we're

          making a diorama for the science fair?

                         SUMMERS

          Yes. And if you have a goddam problem

          with that, Mr. Winklevoss, the courts are

          always at your disposal. Athletes don't

          get special treatment at this school.

                         TYLER

          Do they get fairness?

                         SUMMERS

          They don't get to run to daddy. Okay?

          This isn't 50 years ago.

          96,

                         TYLER

          Excuse me, sir, but in your analogy, is

          daddy our father or you?

                         SUMMERS

          Both. Is there anything else I can do for

          you?

                         TYLER-

          Well I wouldn't mind that much if you

          took a flying--

          Yes.

                         GRETCHEN

          What was the purpose of the trip?

                         EDUARDO

          As CFO, I'd set up some meetings with

          potential advertisers.

                         GRETCHEN

          Who paid for the trip?

          97.

                         EDUARDO

          It was paid for out of the thousand

          dollar account I'd set up a few months

          earlier.

                         GRETCHEN

          At this point your thousand dollars was

          the only money that had been put into the

          company.

          Yes.

          They went terribly.

                         SEAN

          . tried to sell the company to pay the

          I'll say.

          EDUARDO (V.o.)

          And then he went to his second business

          venture which was Plaxo, an online

          rolodex.

                         SEAN

          See, we had a VC from the beginning.

          Michael Moritz, a partner at Sequoia

          Capital who'd invested in Yahoo and

          Google. Moritz wanted to push me out from

                         THE BE

          ginning and he hired private detectives to dig up everything on me

          they could. Did they find anything? No.

          But I was out of the company. I'm not

          done with Moritz and Sequoia Capital yet.

          I swear to God, Mark, before I'm 25 I'm

          gonna make those guys kiss my ass and

          then cry like girls, There will be

          retribution for Plaxo and I'm not just

          talking. I brought down the record

          companies with Napster and I'll bring

          down Michael Moritz,

          EDUARDO (V.O.)

          And he told story after story about life

          in Silicon Valley, parties at Stanford

          and-down in LA, friends who" d become

          billionaires--and then he finally got

          around to theFacebook.

          Tell me about the strategy you're using.

                         MARK

          Okay. For instance, we wanted Baylor in

          Texas but Baylor already had a social

          network on campus so instead of going

          right after them, we made a list of every

          school within a hundred miles and put

          theFacebook on those campuses first.

          Pretty soon all the Baylor kids were

          seeing their friends on our site and we

          were in.

          Settle an argument for us, would you? I

          say it's time to start making money from

          theFacebook but Mark doesn't want

          advertising. Who's right?

          Wel1... .I figured we were a team and I

          wanted to be a team player. I figured

          EXT. PALO ALTO HOUSE - DAY

          MARK is standing on the roof of this small, campus-area house

          as LOUD MUSIC plays. A zii12'line is tied from the chimney and

          runs down over a small swimming pool where it's attached to a

          telephone pole on the other side.

          MARK grabs onto the handle that's connected to the zip line

          and flies out over the pool, jumping in with a splash and

          cheers from DUSTIN and the INTERNS who are waiting their turns

          on the roof.

          DUSTIN pulls the handle back up with_a rope that's been

          rigged, grabs the handle, takes off and jumps into the pool-to

          similar cheers.

          The handle gets pulled back on a rope, an INTERN grabs it,

                         JUMPS--

          --and the brick chimney comes crashing down.

          The INTERN drops into patio furniture as bricks from the

          chimney come cascading down.

                         EVERYONE SCRAMBLES--

                         ALL

          Shit!/Are you alright?!/ Jesus!/etc-

                         INTERN (ERIC)

          I'm okay.

          You sure?

                         ERIC

          Yeah.

                         MARK

          Is anything broken?

                         ERIC

          No.

          And at that moment a stray brick drops from the roof and

          crashes through a glass patio table.

                         INTERN (STEVEN)

          That's gonna out into the security

          deposit.

          From inside the DOORBELL RINGS--

                         DUSTIN

          That's the doorbell.

                         MARK

          I didn't know we had a doorbell.

          He's wired in.

          MARK walks into--

          INT. PALO ALTO HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

          The place is computer geek paradise. Computers are everywhere,

          along with some of the empty boxes they came in. Pizza boxes,

          Chinese food containers, empty beer bottles and white boards

          filled with indecipherable code fill the room. There are a

          couple of large mattresses on the floor and a large map of the

          U.S. with pins and tags showing the schools where they've

          already put Facebook and different pins showing the schools

          they're going for.

          As MARK walks to the door, he walks past ANDREW, who's sitting

          at a computer, writing code and completely oblivious to

          everything around him.

          Good boy.

          MARK gets to the door and opens it.

          He's stunned to see SEAN PARKER standing there with his

          girlfriend, SHARON.

          They all look at each other for a moment---

          No. You live across the street.

          I'm Sharon.

                         SEAN

          This is my girlfriend, Sharon. She lives

          across the street and I was helping her

          move out when we saw the chimney--

                         MARK

          Yeah, we had a zip line to the pool.

                         SEAN

          You came to California.

                         MARK

          Yeah.

                         SEAN

          You made the right choice.

          INT. PALO ALTO HOUSE - LATER

          SEA,'s looking around the place. DUSTIN and the INTERNS are

          standing off to the side, happy to be in the presenbe of Sean

          Parker. ANDREW'S still locked into his computer. MARK's off in

          the kitchen.

                         MARK (OS)

          Here you go.

          A beer comes flying out of the kitchen and SEAN catches it.

          MARK (OS) (CONT'D)

          Sharon.

          Another beer comes flying out which SHARON had no idea was

          coming and so it smashes into the fireplace.

          119.

                         SHARON

          Oh God. I'm so sorry.

          And a brick comes down the chimney and crashes on top of the

          broken glass from the beer bottle.

                         DUSTIN

          You know, ironically, we're paying an

          extra 50 bucks a month 'cause it has a

          working fireplace.

                         SEAN

          This house is great. The team is great.

          It's exactly what it should be.

          EXT. RUBY SKYE - NIGHT

          An ultra-hip San Prancisco nightclub where a line of well-

          dressed young people stretches from the clipboard holding

          BOUNCER down the block. The BOUNCER motions to three SEXY

          GIRLS who are let in through the velvet rope. If this reminds

          us of the scene at the final club party at the beginning of

          this story than that's fine.

          The three SEXY GIRLS take us into

          INT. RUBY SKYE - CONTINUOUS

          It's a hundred-year old theater that's been converted into a

          21st Century hot spot for Silicon Valley's rock stars. The

          lower level is a giant dance floor packed"with sweating 20-

          somethings bouncing to pounding house music. There are raised

          blocks where scantily dressed professional. dancers perform non-

          stop. A huge lighting grid hangs from the ceiling shooting

          colored lights and lasers everywhere. Also hanging from the

          ceiling are two trapeze bars with two performers swinging and

          contorting.

          120,

          A WAITRESS holding a tray of colored drinks high over her head

          takes us through the crowd to a spiral staircase that's being

          guarded by two more BOUNCERS with clipboards. The staircase

          leads up to the 2nd level which is all VIP tables that look

          out over the dance floor. Each VIP area has a couple of

          couches and a table covered in bottles of vodka, tequila, rum,

          mixers, ice, glasses and a private waitress who's happy to

          bend over and pour a drink for you,

          And that's where we catch up with MARK and SEAN. Sitting next

          to SEAN is a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN and there's another standing

          behind him and leaning against the couch.

          MARK and SEAN have to speak the music.

                         MARK

          I still can't believe I rented a house

          across the street from you.

                         SEAN

          That's not my house. It was Sharon's. I

          was crashing there for a little. bit while

          I'm taking care of some things. But she's

          done for the summer so she's back at her

          parents' place and I'm homeless.

          months--she was giving blow. jobs to the

          co-captain of the lacrosse team. And I

          found out and I was willing to forgive

          her but she told me she loved him. So I

          had this dream that I would make a

          billion dollar company.. Not a million

          dollar company--any hack can do that---a

          billion dollar company. And I would have

          we're looking at a stone bridge crossing a perfectly straight

          stretch of water against the backdrop of the medieval town of

          Henley, England--founded in 1179.

          And after a moment of placid quiet--

                         ---BOOSHI

          Two razor thin skulls explode out from under the bridge for

          the final, agonizing hundred-meter stretch of the ancient and

          prestigious Henley Royal Regatta.

          The two boats are neck and neck coming out of the bridge. The

          port-side boat is being crewed by the two Dutch members of the

          Ilollandia Roeiclub. The starboard boat is being crewed by a

          pair of identical twins wearing tank tops bearing the "H" of

          Harvard.

          We HEAR the ROAR come up from the CROWD in the viewing

          section. The crowd is dressed as if for opening day at Ascot

          -- the women in flowing dresses and wide-brimmed hats, the men i n

          blazers and brightly colored floral ties.

          But the young men in the boats can barely hear the crowd. Just

          their own breathing as they pull against the longest natural.

          straight stretch of water in the world--a mile and a half

          torture test against the best competition they've ever faced.

          And they're neck and neck. CAMERON and TYLER can't shake the

          Dutch.

          The CROWD is going crazy in their own English way as none of

          them can remember ever seeing two boats this close this late.

          Mixed in with the British crowd is a small contingent waving

          the flag of Holland and a slightly larger contingent of

          Americans.

          124.

          We'll notice a stoic man in a VIP viewing section and latex

          we'll be introduced to him as Cameron and Tyler's father, Next

          to him is their mother, who can barely watch.

          Back on the boats it's just the breathing as the skulls slice

          through the water like jet-powered knives. 50 meters now and

          there's still no daylight between them.

          We see a small trickle of blood from CAMERON's left hand begin

          to stream down his arm.

          25 meters and the Dutch and American fans are going crazy--

          even the British aristocracy can't help but get caught ups

          the closest race in the history of the competition. The 'ATH_PT'i12

          is silently willing his boys one more fraction of boat speed--

          the MOTHER has her hands over her mouth in praying position.

          The blood that's covering CAMERON's left arm is being diluted

          by the sweat that's pouring down from his triceps as they dig,

          and pull, and pull, and pull, and---

          POP!

          --the finish gun is fired into the air, the oars come out of

          the water and the bodies of the crewmen slump over.

          CAMERON turns his head to the cheering crowd to see the Dutch

          group holding a giant flag and.jumping up and down. The

          Americans bring their giant flag down and fold it up.

          The two DUTCH CREW. MEMBERS pump their fists in the air and hug

          as the two boats skim along to a gentle stop.

          The MOTHER drops her head-and looks down. The FATHER refuses

          to look away.

          From CAMERON and TYLER, just the'breathing.,

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. AWARD CEREMONY - DAY

          CAMERON and TYLER are standing with their coaches and next to

          the two DUTCH CREWMEN who are with their coaches. They're on a

          stand in the Steward's Enclosure, a sprawling and glamorous

          tented area for the exclusive use of members and their guests.

          After a moment, a man in a double breasted navy blazer steps

          out with his retinue in tow. The man is PRINCE ALBERT of

          Monaco. He receives a healthy clapping of golf applause as he

          approaches the stand.

          This conversation is done without microphones or anything as

          modern as that.

          125.

                         AIDE

          His Royal Highness, Prince Albert. Sir,

          may I present Mr. Cameron Winklevoss and

          Mr. Tyler. Winklevoss of Harvard

          University.

                         PRINCE ALBERT

          Brilliant race. Never seen a race that

          close. Less than one second, the steward

          tells me.

                         TYLER

                         (BEAT)

          Yes, Your Highness.

                         PRINCE ALBERT

          My grandfather, Jack Kelly, was one of

          the premiere rowers of his day. I've been

          coming to Henley for 30 years. Never seen

          a race that close. Have you? Have you

          seen a race that close?

          CAMERON is thinking about starting a war with Monaco right now

          so he lets his brother do the talking.

                         TYLER

                         (BEAT)

          No, Your Highness. Mile and a half races

          are more commonly won by a boat length or

          two.

                         PRINCE ALBERT

          Yes, that's absolutely right. Less than a

          second though in your case. Well as they

          say, I suppose it just came down to who

          wanted it more.

                         CAMERON

                         (SNAPPING)

          Oh what a bullshit cliche: You think we

                         DIDN'T---

                         TYLER

                         (EASY)

          Cam.

          There's an awkward silence for a moment...

                         PRINCE ALBERT

          Will I have the pleasure of watching you

          both row again in Beijing?

                         TYLER

          If we make the team, sir, yes. Thank you.

                         PRINCE ALBERT

          I present you with your Second Place

          ribbons. On to the champions!

          126,

          And off the APPLAUSE from the crowd, we

          INT./EXT. STEWARD'S TENT - DAY

          The regatta party is underway. Music, drinks, uniformed

          waiters, blazers and hats everywhere.

          TYLER and CAMERON have changed into their Harvard. blazers and

          are joined now by DIVYA. The three of them have tried to find

          an unpopulated spot. TYLER and DIVYA have glasses of beer and

          are standing but CAMERON's sitting at a table with a laptop

          open and watching film of the end of the race.

          Hitting reverse on the computer and watching, over and over

          again, the bow of the Dutch boat pull ahead by six inches at

          just the right moment.

                         CAMERON

          Yeah. We didn't want it enough. That was

          the problem. Fuck you, you fucking little--

                         DIVYA

          Casa. The guy' s the prince of a country

          the size of East Hampton. Let it go.

          MR. WINKLEVOSS has made his way over...

          Boys.

          Divya.

                         DIVYA

          How are-you, Mr. Winklevoss.

          MR. WINKLEVOSS

          That was a tough beat. A tough beat.

                         CAMERON

          I'm sorry, dad. You and mom flew all the

          way over.

          MR. WINKLEVOSS

          Listen to me good, you two. Don't you

          ever apologize to me for losing a race

          like that. Don't you ever apologize to

          anyone for losing a race like that.

          Another man comes along, MR. KENWRIGHT.

          127.

                         KENWRIGHT

          -Boys.

                         TYLER

          Oh. Mr. Kenwright. Dad, this is Mr.

          Kenwright, part of our host family this

          week.

                         KENWRIGHT

          Pleasure to meet you.

          MR. WINKLEVOSS

          Good to meet you.

                         KENWRIGHT

          I just had the most extraordinary phone

          chat with my daughter. She told me that

          she and her friends are all talking about

          the race, which ended just, a half-hour

          ago, via their computers. A new website

          called Facebook. Do you have this in

          America?

          Eve.ryon= is frozen...

                         DIVYA

                         (PAUSE)

          Your daughter doesn't go to school in the

          U.S.?

                         KENWRIGHT

          No no. Cambridge. Majoring in French

          Literature, though I wasn't aware there

          was such a thing.

                         TYLER

                         (PAUSE)

          They have Facebook at Cambridge?

                         RENWRIGHT

          And Oxford, St. Andrews, Warwick and the

          London School of Economics best as I can

          tell. because that's where her friends

          are.

          MR. WINKLEVOSS

          I'm going to find your mother.

                         KENWRIGIT

          Good race, boys. Live to fight another

          day.

                         TYLER

          Thank you.

          The men leave and CAMERON, TYLER and DIVYA are alone. CAMERON

          looks at them for a moment, then turns back to watching the

                         RACE FILM--

          128.

                         TYLER (CONT'D)

          Turn it off.

                         (PAUSE)

          Turn it off, Cam. Look at me.

          CAMERON turns to his brother...

                         TYLER (CONT'D)

          I don't mind that we got beat by the

          Dutch by less than a second. That was a

          fair race, that was a good race and they

          had the better boat today and they'll see

          us again. What I mind is that we got beat

          by Mark Zuckerberg...by less than a

          second.

                         (BEAT)

          We tried the Ad Board, we tried the

          president of the University and we tried

          talking to him ourselves. Now I'm asking

          you. For the one-hundreth time. Let's

          take the considerable-resources at our

          disposal and sue him in a federal. court.

          CAMERON looks at his brother...then turns back to the

          computer. He watches the Dutch boat pull ahead at the last

          moment. TYLER and DIVYA are just about to give up when CAMERON

          swings back and says--

                         CAMERON

          Let's fucking gut that little nerd.

                         DIVYA

          There's a thunderstorm going on outside and rain is beating

          hard against the windows, DUSTIN, ANDREW-and the INTERNS are

          hard at work writing code. Green Day is pumping from the

          speakers.

          SEAN is pacing the house on his cell phone while two YOUNG

          WOMEN--dressed to go out for a party--are at the moment each

          on a free computer playing each other in a game of Counter-

          Strike. Basically they're shooting at each other and missing

          and laughing their heads off,

          it wouldn't appear as if the house has been cleaned since the

          last time we saw it and in fact there are signs of more

          wreckage as well as futons, pillows and blankets on the floor.

          Ra:i.n is soaking down on EDUARDO as he stands at the front door

          with a suitcase in his hand. A taxi is turning around in the

          SEAN leans over one of the girls, casually hits a few keys and

          easily kills several of the other girl's soldiers.

          Yes!

          Bong hit.

                         DUSTIN

          Anybody hear that banging?

          While the following is going on, here's what's happening: The

          girls have gone over to a 12-foot bong that starts at the

          floor and goes to the landing at the top of the stairs.

          130,

          it gets lit at the bottom and smoked at the top so the girl

          who just got her soldiers hit trots up the stairs.

                         SEAN

                         (TO DUSTIN)

          You don't hear anything, you're supposed

          to be writing code.

                         DUSTIN

          Dude, somebody's at the door.

          SEAN goes back to the cell phone conversation as he heads to

                         THE DOOR--

                         SEAN

                         (INTO PHONE)

          The guy hires a P.T, to follow me around.

          Who does that in real life? Michael

          Moritz and I are gonna meet in a dark

          alley, I'll take Sequoia Capital down

          with him.

          SEAN opens the door and the soaking wet EDUARDO is standing

          there...

                         EDUARDO

          What the hell.

          Mark was supposed to get me at the

          airport two hours ago, I've been calling

          his cell.

                         SEAN

          He was on a 36 hour coding tear so he

          took a nap for a couple of hours.

          EDUARDO walks into the house and surveys the wreckage--

                         EDUARDO

          What in hell happened here?

                         SEAN

          Not happened--happening. The next big

          thing.

                         DUSTIN

          Wardo!

                         (TO DUSTIN)

          Back to work.

          The girl at the bottom of the stairs has filled the bowl and

          lights a lighter--

          GIRT, #1

          You ready?

                         GIRL #2

          Go.

          EDUARDO watches as the girl at the top of the stairs takes a

          12-foot hit from the tower-bong.

                         EDUARDO

          Flow old are they, Sean?

                         SEAN

          It's not polite to ask,

                         EDUARDO

          How old are they?

                         SEAN

          You think you know me, don't you.

                         EDUARDO

          I've read enough.

                         SEAN

          You know how much I've read about you?

          Nothing.

          MARK comes down the stairs--

                         MARK

          Wardo.

                         EDUARDO

          I waited an hour for you at the airport.

                         MARK

          What time is it?

                         EDUARDO

          It's midnight. Or 3AM in New York where I

          just came from.

                         MARK

          You've gotta see some of the new stuff

          we've got. Dustin, show him the wall. I'm

          just calling it the wall.

          132.

          INT. FACEBOOK OFFICE - DAY

           A glass conference room in the corner of a glass bullpen on a

          high floor of a high rise.

          Cartons are being unpacked, computers are everywhere along

          with bags of potato chips and boxes of cereal.

          In the conference room, EDUARDO is sitting with three LAWYERS

          at a round, glass table and documents have been put out in

          front of him.

          1.42.

          We can see through the glass that MARY, is working at a

          computer nearby. SEAN is also hovering in the background.

                         LAWYER

          Four documents, These two are common

          stock purchase agreements allowing you to

          buy stock in the newly re-incorporated

          Facebook instead of the old stock which

          is now worthless, The third is the

          exchange agreement, that's for exchanging

          your old shares for new shares and this

          is the voter holding agreement.

                         EDUARDO

          How many shares of stock will I own?

                         LAWYER

          1,328,334.

          Jesus Christ.

                         LAWYER

          That's a 34.4% ownership share. Why the

          rise from the original 30%?

                         EDUARDO

          Because you may need to dilute it to

          award shares to new investors.

                         LAWYER

          I like dealing with business majors.

                         LAWYER #2

          You should know that Mark's already taken

          his percentage from 60 down to 51.

                         EDUARDO

          Mark doesn't care about money and he

          needs to be protected.

          150.

                         EDUARDO

          You did it. I always knew you did it. You

          planted the story about the chicken.

                         SEAN

                         (PAUSE)

          What the fuck is he talking about?

          I didn't.

                         EDUARDO

          You had me accused of animal cruelty.

                         SEAN

          Seriously, what the fuck is up with the

          chicken?

                         EDUARDO

          And I'll bet you just hated that they

          identified me as a co-founder of Facebook-

          -which I am! You better lawyer-up,

          asshole, 'cause I'm not comin' for my 30

          percent, I'm comin' after everythin g

                         SEAN

                         (TO SECURITY)

          Get him outa here.

                         EDUARDO

          I'm going.

                         SEAN

          Hang on.

          SEAN hands EDUARDO aafolded check.

                         SEAN (CONT'D)

          There's your $19,000. 1 wouldn't cash it,

          though, I drew it on the account you

          froze.

          EDUARDO looks. at SEAN. . .then suddenly and quickly cocks his

          fist back to punch him in the face. SEAN flinches as EDUARDO

          holds his punch and lets out a small laugh.

                         EDUARDO

          I like standing next to you, Sean. It

          makes me look tough in comparison.

          EDUARDO exits with the security escort.

          There's a long silence in the room...

          151.

                         SEAN

          That's it. That's our show for tonight. I

          want to see everybody here get geared up

          for a party. We're gonna walk down to the

          club like it's the Macy's Thanksgiving

          Parade. Mackey, put it up on the screen,

          we've gotta be almost there.

          A young employee hits a remote and a few keys on his computer

          and a huge flat-screen displays a Facebook page with a read-

          out of the number of members.

          999,982

          There's scattered applause and excitement as everyone watches.

          SEAN takes MARK aside.

                         SEAN (CONT'D)

          You alright?

                         MARK

          Yeah.

                         (BEAT)

          You were kinda rough on him.

                         SEAN

          That's life in the NFL.

                         MARK

          No. You didn't have to be that rough on

          him.

                         SEAN

          Listen, I'm putting together a party-.-

                         MARK

          Sean? You didn't have to be that rough on

          him.

                         SEAN

          I get it. I'll send flowers. I'm putting

          -together a party after the party at Gamma

          Phi Beta. Ashleigh over there's a sister

          and she says her friends are all down..

                         MARK

          Ashleigh?

                         SEAN

          Yeah.

                         MARK

          That's great. I've been, you know, I've

          been talking to her a little. I don't

          know, I think she likes me.

          152,

                         SEAN

          Oh dude.

                         MARK

          What?

                         SEAN

          Yeah.

          An intern, ASHLEIGH, comes along With a small package--

                         ASHLEIGH

          Excuse me, Mark?

          SEAN.

          We were just talkin' about you,Ash.

          We're on for tonight?

                         ASHLEIGH

          Yeah.

                         (TO MARK)

          This came in for you.

                         MARK

          You can put it on my desk.

          ASHLEIGH puts the small package on Mark's desk.

                         SEAN

          She's 19, I can't he.lp it, But I'll tell

          you what--after tonight.she's yours. in

          fact, I'm. gonna get' you in with all sorts

                         (CALLING OUT)

          Mackey!

                         MACKEY

                         (CALLING BACK)

          Yes sir!

                         SEAN

          Refresh!

                         MARK

          (blandly to SEAN)

          You'd do that for me?

          MACKEY hits the "refresh" key and the big screen shows--

          1,000,002

          CHEERS erupts throughout the place. SEAN grabs MARK and hugs

          him but MARK doesn't quite hug back--he's still hearing what

          SEAN just said.

                         CUT TO:

          153.

          EXT. SORORITY HOUSE - NIGHT

          We can hear the thumping music coming 'from the party inside

          and college kids have spilled out onto the front lawn of this

          pristine, four-columned house.

          INT. SORORITY HOUSE - NIGHT

          It's dark but we can make out people dancing. The place is

          packed.

                         UT TO

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          We hear the thumping music from the party. SEAN's in there

          with a couple of guys, ASHLEIGH and another GIRL. SEAN's got

          his cell phone out and will snap a picture every once in a

          while.

                         GIRL

          I can't find a mirror.

                         GUY

          Do it on anything. You can use a CD.

                         ASHLEIGH

          Do it off this.

          ASHLEIGH's sat on the bed and unbuttoned her top so that she's

          in just a bra. She's offering her chest as a surface off of

          which to snort cocaine.

                         GIRL

          Alright!

          The GIRL taps out some coke from a vial onto ASHLEIGH's chest

          and starts passing around a rolled up 20-dollar bill for

          everyone to have a turn and she herself will unbutton her

          shirt too for the same purpose. All this while SEAN is

          talking,

                         SEAN

          The next transformative development? A

          picture sharing application. A place

          where you view pictures that coincide

          with your social life. It is the

          true... digitalization of real life. You

          don't just go to a party anymore, you go

          to a party with your digital camera and

          your friends relive the party on

          Facebook. And tagging. The idea that you

          could tag anyone you wanted in those

          pictures so that people could find

          themselves. Then a digital log of every

          change in a person's life, broadcast to

          all their friends instantaneously.

          154,

                         ASHLEIGH

          Would this be easier without the bra?

                         GUY

          It's worth finding out.

          The girls start happily slipping off their bras--

          .SEAN

          I've spent hours--

                         ASHLEIGH

          Why has the music stopped?

                         SEAN

          I've spent hours watching what people do

          when they log on.

                         ASHLEIGH

          Seriously, why has the music stopped?

          ASHLEIGH has a point. The music stopped in the addle of

          SEAN's speech and the sound outside from the party just

          doesn't sound like a party anymore.

                         SEAN

          flow they always checked their friends'

          status updates, checked to see which of

          their friends had changed their profiles,

          changed their photos and mostly...We

          lived on farms, then we lived in cities

          and now we're gonna live on the internet.

                         - ASHLEIGH

          Sean. Stop. Something's going on

          downstairs,

          SEAN stops talking-he senses it too now.

          SEAN walks out of the room to the--

          INT, STAIRCASE LANDING - CONTINUOUS

          And out the window he sees a fleet of police cars with their

          lights flashing parked in front of the house. Then before he

          can react, the front door flies open--

          POLICE with flashlights walk in--the beams of light streaking

          across the darkened party floor and the faces..

          We HEAR muffled murmurs from the cops of "party's over" and

          "step to the side" and "nobody's leaving just yet", etc.

          SEAN bolts back into--

          155.

          INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

          --leaving the door open.

                         SEAN

          It's the cops.

          And they all spring into action. The girls are putting their

          bras back on, SEAN is wiping down a night table with the palm

          of his hand to get the coke dust off.

                         SEAN (CONT'D)

                         POLICEMAN

          What's goin' on?

          They turn to see TWO POLICEMEN standing in the doorway, their

          flashlights scanning the room and hitting SEAN's eyes.

                         SEAN

                         (BEAT)

          We're sorry, was the music too loud?

          We've got kind of a celebration going.

                         POLICEMAN

          Ladies, I need you to put your shirts on.

                         SEAN

          I can have them turn the music down.

          One of the policemen casually takes SEAN's hand and sees that

          his palm looks like he just used it to erase a blackboard. The

          cop uses his finger to taste what it is.

                         SEAN (CONT'D)

          Yeah, that isn't mine.

                         POLICEMAN

          Okay, could you all stay where you are.

          And the handcuffs start to come out and we've got a room of

          terrified children.

          GIRL,

          Wait, can we just talk for a second?

          We start to move in on SEAM...

          150.

                         POLICEMAN

                         (TO SEAN)

          You got anything in your pockets I need

          to know about?

                         SEAN

          No sir.

                         - POLICEMAN

          Don't be stupid now,

                         SEAN

          I don It.

                         POLICEMAN

          (out of SEAN's shirt pocket)

          What's this?

                         SEAN

          It's an Epipen,

                         POLICEMAN

          And this?

                         SEAN

          That's my inhaler.

                         POLICEMAN #2

          Ladies, how old are you?

                         GIRL

          I'm 20.

                          ASHLEIGH

          I'm 19,

                         POLICEMAN

          Lying makes a i_'E worse.

                         ASHLEIGH

          I'm 17, I-'m sorry, I shouldn't have lied.

          SEAN closes. his eyes at hearing this news as we HEAR the sound

          of the-cuffs lock around his wrists and we

                         CUT TO:

          INT. NEW FACEBOOK OFFICES - NIGHT

          A digital LED clock on the wall tells us it's 4:40AM.

          MARK is sitting at his computer alone. No one else is in the

          office. The San Francisco skyline is beautiful outside the

          floor-to-ceiling glass.

          His cell phone RINGS and he answers.

          1. 57.

          EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

          SEAN, freezing with no coat on, is sitting on the bottom of

          the steps to the police station.'The LAWYER we've seen before

          is standing in back of him.

                         SEAN

                         (INTO PHONE)

          Listen, something's happened.

          We see MARK listening on his end but can't hear SEAN's end of

          the conversation.

                         MARK

                         (PAUSE)

          Shit.

                         SEAN

          It's alright, it's gonna be alright. I've

          posted bond-and I wasn't doing anything.

          I mean, I've got allergies so I can't----

          We're back on MARK's side. He listens... listens...

          Back on SEAN's side-

                         SEAN

          I think it was Moritz. I swear, I think

          it was Michael Moritz.

                         (NO PANIC)

          I'll get it under control. I'll call our

          guys and see what the next move is. But

          this is gonna be news now.

                         SEAN

          You think it was Moritz? 'Cause I do. And

          I'm gonna meet that guy in a dark alley

          one night. Or Eduardo? Did Eduardo have

          (cool as ice)

          Go home, Sean. I'll call our people.

          MARK clicks the phone shut. He sits there a moment.

          He looks at the small package. that Ashleigh dropped on his

          desk earlier. He opens up the brown paper wrapping and there's

          a box.

          He opens the box--a thousand brand new business cards. He

          takes one of the business cards out and looks at it.

          I'm CEO ...Bitoh

          And over this we HEAR a woman's voice...

                         MARYLIN

                         (SMILES)

          Something tells me over the long run

          there's more money in being your lawyer.

          What happened to Sean?

                         MAIM

          He cashed out most of his stock. Hey

          listen, all you had all day was that

          salad. You want to get something to eat?

                         MARYLIN

          I can't.

                         MARK

          I'm not a bad guy.

                         MARYLIN

          I know that. I like you.

                         MARK

          What happens now?

                         MARYLIN

          Sy and the rest of them are at the Palm

          having a steak. Then they'll come back, up

          to the office and start working on a

          settlement agreement to present to you.

                         MARK

          They're gonna want to settle?

                         MARYLIN

          Oh yeah. And you're gonna have to pay

          some bonus money too.

                         MARK

          Why?

                         MARYLIN

          'Cause you're gonna need these guys to

          sign a non-disclosure agreement and

          you're gonna need to be indemnified. They

          say one unflattering word about you in

          public and you own their house, wife and

          kids.

                         MARK

          I invented Facebook.

          160.

                         MARYLIN

          I'm talking about what a jury'll see.

          .That's what I do, that's what I'm doing

          here. I'm trying to specialize in voir

          dire--jury selection. Clothes, hair,

          wedding ring, speaking style, likability--

                         MARK

          Likability?

                         MARYLIN

          I've been licensed to practice law for

          all of-20 months and I could get a jury

          to believe you planted the story about

          Eduardo. You know how? Just by asking the

          question. Watch. Why weren't you at the

          sorority party that night?

                         MARK

          You think I'm the one who called the

          police?

                         MARYLIN -

          Doesn't matter, I asked the question and

          now everybody's thinking about it. You

          lost the jury in the first 10 minutes.

                         MARK

                         (PAUSE)

          Farm animals?

          .MARYLIN

          Yeah,

                         MARK

          I was drunk and angry and stupid.

                         MARYLIN

          And blogging.

                         (PAUSE)

          Pay the fine. Get your parking validated.

          Get out of it. That's what Sy and the

          guys'll tell you in the morning.

                         MARK

          Would anyone mind it I stayed and used

          the computer for a minute?

                         MARYLIN

          No. There's a night guy downstairs. Stay

          as long as you want.

                         MARK

          Thanks. I appreciate your help today,

                         MARYLIN

          You're not an asshole, Mark. You just

          want to be.

          161.

          MARYI,IN, who's been putting on her coat, takes her briefcase

          and exits.

          MARK sits down at the computer. He logs on to Facebook.

          He -types a name in the-search box: "Erica Albright".

          Erica's name and picture come up, along with Boston

          University, '07. Mark smiles. She's on Facebook.

          He moves the mouse back and forth between two boxes: "Send a

          Message." and "Add as a Friend".

          He clicks on "Add as a Friend".

          A box comes up that reads: "Your request to add Erica Albright

          as a friend has been sent."

          Then MARK clicks to his homepage and waits for the response.

          And waits...

                         TITLE:

          MARK is still waiting...

          Eduardo Saverin received an unknown Gash settlement. His name

          has been restored to the Facebook masthead as a founder.

          MARK is settling into his chair. He'll wait all night if he

          has to.

          currently valued at 15 billion dollars.
