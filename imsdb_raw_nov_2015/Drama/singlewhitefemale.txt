BLACK SCREEN

On a black screen, the words (without capital letters in front of

the words) :

       presents

and then :

       a film by

       barbet schroeder

BATHROOM - INTERIOR

We don't know if it's day or night. We see a little girl, aged

around eight, putting lipstick on her lips. She is wearing

earrings and a ring on the middle finger of her right hand. She

moves forward and we see another girl about the same age. The

first girl puts lipstick on the lips of the second girl. Both girl

are smiling.

More credits, still without capital letters.

The camera moves back and we get a better view of the second girl.

The two girls appear to be twins. The first girl takes a powder

puff and puts powder on the second girl's cheeks.

The two girls look at themselves in the mirror. The camera gives

the impression to be located behind the mirror.

The first girl gives a kiss on the cheek of the second girl.

FADE OUT TO BLACK SCREEN

The title of the film appears on the black screen.

The camera moves and we see, appearing on the right-hand side of

the screen :

BUILDING - EXTERIOR NIGHT

This building is actually Allison's building, but we don't know it

yet.

Credits resume on the screen.

The camera keeps on moving and we see several lit windows. The

building itself is a nice building with carvings on the walls.

The camera moves backward, giving us a full view of the building.

As the camera comes back forward, we hear two voices speaking, one

male, one female. They are the voices of Allison Allie Jones and

her fiance Sam Rawson.

       SAM (voice over)

       So how many kids do we want ?

       ALLISON (voice over)

       I dunno. What's the statistical norm ?

       SAM (voice over)

       You and your statistics.

Allison laughs

       SAM (voice over)

       One point two.

       ALLISON (voice over)

       Okay, then I want two point two.

Fade to :

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Sam and Allison are lying on the bed, partly dressed. Sam is

holding Allison next to him. They are both about thirty years old.

Allison has short red hair, and Sam has brown wavy hair.

Behind the front of the bed we see the wrought iron of the

balcony. The light is very dim in the room, lit only by the street

lights and a couple of candles. We hear Allison finishing her last

voice over sentence.

       ALLISON

       And I want them to look like you.

       SAM

       Poor kids.

End of credits.

       SAM

       So, if I got to be able to drag you away from computer

       tomorrow, I'll buy you that ring.

       ALLISON

       Sure. So, is this gonna be a real wedding ?

She moves a bit away from him, and takes a piece of grapes in a

plate lying on the floor.

       SAM

       As opposed to a fake one ?

       ALLISON

       You know what I mean, Sam. You've already been through the

       big ceremony with too hundred people.

       SAM

       That was the fake one. This is the real one. You can have

       any kind of wedding you want. Underwater. In and out of a

       steam room in the wild. Horseback.

Allison goes back into Sam's arms.

       ALLISON

       Naked skydiving ?

       SAM

       Naked skydiving !

       ALLISON

       It's OK. It's going to have to be a small one, you know.

       I've not been in New York long enough to know very many

       people.

       SAM

       Except me.

       ALLISON

       Oh, you're invited.

They laugh.

       ALLISON

       And my friend Graham upstairs.

       SAM

       It won't be long before you know half the people in New

       York. People like you, you know... but I found you first.

       ALLISON

       You're the only friend I need. You're the best thing that

       ever happened to me.

They start kissing very tenderly.

Fade to two seconds of black screen. And then we see Sam and

Allison asleep in the bed. They are naked but covered with the

sheet.

The phone rings. Allison wakes up and picks up the phone handset.

       ALLISON

       Hello ?... Hold on a second.

She bends down to take the telephone set.

       ALLISON

       Sam, it's your ex-wife.

She gives the receiver to Sam. Still half-asleep, Sam takes the

phone.

       SAM

       What ?

       ALLISON

       It's Lisa.

Sam puts the receiver to his ear. We hear vaguely Lisa's voice,

but not precisely enough to understand the words.

       SAM

       Yeah ?... No... Because... I'm hanging up now.

He puts the handset back on the telephone set, which Allison had

put on the bed.

       SAM

       I'm sorry. She shouldn't call here.

       ALLISON

       It's where you live. She's entitled.

The phone rings again. Allison moves up to pick up the phone.

       SAM

       Don't... don't answer it.

The phone keeps on ringing. Then the answering machine starts with

Hi, it's Allison Jones... but the rest of the message is covered

by Sam and Allison's conversation.

       SAM

       Why does she do this ?

       ALLISON

       Talk to her now. You're already up. I'll get that.

We hear the beep at the end of Allison's message.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT

Allison is walking naked in the hall.

       LISA'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE

       Hello, Sam. Oh, damn... Would you pick up the phone,

       please ? Hello ?... Please, don't do this to me.

       SAM (voice over)

       Lisa...

       LISA'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE

       Sam, I've been sitting here since you left this

       afternoon...

Allison is standing up in the dark, not moving. We hear Sam's

voice, partly from the bedroom, and partly from the answering

machine, which gives the voice a sort of echo effect.

       SAM (voice over)

       Yeah... Lisa... Can we talk about this tomorrow ?

       LISA'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE

       You can't come over here and sleep with me, and then...

Close-up on Allison's face in the dark. She looks very shocked by

what she hears.

       SAM (voice over and yelling)

       Allie, Allie, I don't know how you shut that thing off.

       LISA'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE

       You said you were going to call.

Allison shuts the machine off.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Close-up on Sam's face. He picks up the phone and puts the handset

to his ear. We hear Lisa's voice saying : Hello, Sam

       SAM

       Huh-huh...

ALLISON'S APPARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT

Allison grabs a night-robe and presses it on her naked body.

       SAM (voice over)

       Okay ... goodbye.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Sam is seated on the bed. He puts the phone back on the set.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT

       ALLISON

       I take it back. She's not entitled.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Close-up on the ancient-looking ventilation system in the bedroom.

The air vent is protected by a very decorative wrought iron grill,

as can be found in old New-York buildings.

       SAM (voice over)

       I didn't go over there intending to sleep with her, Allie.

       I swear to God.

       ALLISON (voice over)

       Oh, well, I fell a lot better knowing you can talk now.

GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - GRAHAM'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Close-up on the same air vent in Graham's apartment. We can hear

the conversation going on in Allison's bedroom, with a slight echo

effect in the sound, which makes some words incomprehensible, but

still well enough to get the general idea of the conversation.

       SAM (voice over from the air vent)

       She's very depressed, OK ? It's the anniversary of our

       divorce. She heard we were getting married. She has been

       drinking.

Slowly the camera moves from the air vent to Graham's bed.

Graham Knox is about thirty years old, and we shall learn later

that he is gay. He is lying in his bed, perhaps naked, but we see

only his chest, the rest of his body being covered by the sheets.

He was apparently awaken by the voices in the ventilation system

and is half-raised on his elbow and listening to the conversation.

       ALLISON (voice over from the air vent)

       I don't want to hear this !

       SAM (voice over from the air vent)

       I feel bad for her. I'm moving on feeling guilty. It won't

       happen again.

       ALLISON (voice over from the air vent)

       (a few words incomprehensible)

       I am supposed to trust you now ?

Graham is listening with a worried look on his face.

Fade out to two second of black screen, during which we keep on

hearing the conversation through the ventilation system, but

without understanding the words. And then :

ALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE GRAHAM'S APARTMENT -

INTERIOR NIGHT

Allison rings the bell of Graham's apartment. It says 1203 on the

door.

GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

A corridor with a lot of books on shelves going all the way up to

the ceiling. Graham walks along the corridor, zipping his pants.

He is bare-chested.

       GRAHAM

       It's 4 a.m. !

       ALLISON (voice over through the door)

       It's me, Graham.

Graham opens the door. Allison is just wearing a night-robe, and

her face is full of tears.

       GRAHAM

       Allie ?

       ALLISON

       I'm sorry... Sam left. I told him to. And... And I can't be

       alone tonight... so I came up here.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE GRAHAM'S APARTMENT -

INTERIOR NIGHT

Graham takes Allison by the hand and brings her inside his

apartment.

       ALLISON

       Thanks.

Graham closes the door behind Allison.

GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - SPARE BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

A nice room with pictures on the wall. Allison is sleeping in a

large bed. Through the shutter-less window, we can see the other

buildings.

Graham, dressed in a black T-shirt and kaki short pants, enters

the room and sits on the bed. He takes Allison's leg through the

bedcover. Allison stands up with a start.

       GRAHAM

       Allie, I let you sleep.

       ALLISON

       What time is it ?

       GRAHAM

       About ten.

       ALLISON

       Oh, my God

Allison jumps from the bed in a hurry.

       ALLISON

       I've got a meeting. It's really important.

Graham, still seated on the bed, watches her leave the room.

NEW YORK - A BUSY STREET - EXTERIOR DAY

Allison walks quite rapidly on the sidewalk. She comes to a shop

and looks through the window. She combs her hair with her hand.

A RESTAURANT - INTERIOR DAY

A nice restaurant in New-York. Paintings on the walls. Soft music.

A waitress is talking on the phone. Allison enters the restaurant

and crosses the room to a table, where a man, who was sitting

alone, stands up when she comes to him. The man is Mitchell

Myerson, Allison's appointment.

       ALLISON

       Hi !

       MITCHELL

       Hi !

       ALLISON

       I'm sorry, I'm a little late.

They shake hands.

       MITCHELL

       No, no, it's worth the wait.

       ALLISON

       Thank you.

They sit down. The man takes his glass.

       ALLISON

       So...

A little later. They have finished their meal. Allison has put her

laptop computer on the table and is typing on the keyboard. On the

screen of the computer, we see models of woman's dresses changing

color and appearance each time Allison presses a key.

       ALLISON

       You can redefine your product on-screen without going to an

       expensive designing concept. This is Allison Jones'

       software, and it's a marketing tool no one else has.

       MITCHELL

       Who do I get to run it ?

       ALLISON

       I stay to be the person to speak. That's included in the

       quote.

       MITCHELL

       Ah !... The quote... That's the one thing I haven't seen.

       ALLISON

       Best for last.

She gives him a printed paper.

       ALLISON

       I think you'll find that's reasonable... as a ballpark.

       MITCHELL

       Here's where I was thinking of playing.

He takes a pen out of his pocket and start writing on the document

Allison gave him. Then he hands back the document to her. She

reads it and seems surprised.

       MITCHELL

       It makes sense for you. You see, after our last meeting, I

       made some phone calls... to your former partner, for one.

       ALLISON

       No, I wouldn't rely much on what she says. It was not a

       friendly split. And I did all the work. And... she took all

       the credit and she didn't like me telling her so.

       MITCHELL

       Well, I was more interested in the settlement you made. You

       walked off with the hardware and a rent-controlled

       apartment. Which means your overhead is minimal, as is your

       client list. I could improve that if you're as good as you

       say you are.

He points to what he wrote on the document Allison is still

holding.

       MITCHELL

       But that is the only way to prove it.

       ALLISON

       Well, I could go for something...

The waiter puts the bill in a small tray on the table.

       MITCHELL

       No, no, please, don't embarrass yourself. That's my final

       offer. Now, of course, if you would like to think about

       it...

Allison takes the bill from the tray, and tears the tab off the

bill.

       ALLISON

       I'll get this. You'll see it on my first expense report.

       MITCHELL

       I look forward to it.

They shake hands.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY

The front door opens and Allison gets in and closes the door. She

drops her keys and her handbag on a shelf near the door. She goes

to the answering machine, and presses a key.

       THE ANSWERING MACHINE

       No messages.

The machine beeps.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Allison starts tearing the sheets off the bed. Her movements are

very nervous. And, eventually, she drops on the sheet-less

mattress and starts crying.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - LAUNDRY ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

We hear the first words of Graham's sentence on the previous image

of Allison crying on her bed.

Allison and Graham are working on their respective laundry on a

table. We see washing machines working in the background.

       GRAHAM

       What is this ? A song cue ? You're Nobody Till Somebody

       Loves You.

       ALLISON

       It's just living alone, you know. I thought about buying

       those books like Cooking for One. It's just too

       depressing.

       GRAHAM

       There are worse things than being on your own, you know.

       ALLISON

       Maybe it's all a sign I should go home.

       GRAHAM

       Come on ! You came here for a reason. Sam has nothing to do

       with that. No guy does. You think I'd let some guy

       interfere with my acting career ? Assuming I had a

       career... or a guy to interfere with it.

       ALLISON

       You'll find someone again.

       GRAHAM

       Maybe I will. Why not ? But the point is, if I don't... I

       don't.

       ALLISON

       I know that. I can do it on my own.

       GRAHAM

       Absolutely.

       ALLISON

       I'll just get a room-mate.

       GRAHAM

       You could always call him, Allie.

       ALLISON

       Not if I have a room-mate.

COMPUTER SCREEN

An Apple Computer Screen (certainly Mac OS 7 or even Mac OS 6,

since the film was made in 1991/1992). The window is titled

Comlink Fax TM. On the window itself we can read :

       ATZ

       OK

       ENTER YOUR AD NOW

       SWF SEEKS FEMALE TO SHARE APARTMENT IN W70S

       NON-SMOKER PROFESSIONAL PREFERRED

When we first see the computer screen, only SWF SEEKS FEMALE TO

SH is written. We hear the clicks of the computer keys as the

rest of the ad is written. The computer screen fades into a

newspaper clip after PROFESSIONAL PREF is written.

NEWSPAPER CLIP

We see a newspaper clip, where Allison's ad has been highlighted

with a felt-pen red rectangle. It says :

       SWF seeks female to share

       apartment in west 70s. Non-smoker

       professional preferred. 555-9814

Around this ad are other ads, all about apartment renting or

sharing.

       ALLISON (voice over)

       The managers couldn't really know you want to live there.

ALLISON'S OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY

The previous voice over sentence ends on a close-up of the folded

newspaper with a red felt-pen lying on the newspaper.

The camera moves up from the desk, on which the newspaper is

lying, to Allison's face, who is speaking over the telephone.

Around her, we see other desks with people working.

       ALLISON

       Oh, yes, that's a promise. Rent-stabilized, so you couldn't

       come on the lease.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY

A young butch woman, wearing a leather jacket and a black and

white bandana around her head, bangs her fist on the walls of the

kitchen. She enters the kitchen, where Allison is sitting at a

table. Behind Allison, a nice white stove. The butch girl is

carrying a motorcycle helmet in her left hand. In the credits, the

butch girl is called Mannish Applicant

       THE BUTCH GIRL

       Nice... you could really open 'em up. I can't wait to get

       in here. Are you proper with tools ?

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - SPARE BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

A young very pretty woman, dressed in a short brown dress, moves

around the room and then looks at Allison with a seducing eye.

Allison, who is holding some papers in her hand, looks at the

departing applicant with an amused eye.

Later in the same room. Another applicant is walking around the

room. She's wearing large glasses, and never stops talking. While

she is walking, we hear a camera clicking and we see a camera

flashlight across the room.

       TALKATIVE APPLICANT

       I'm an incest survivor, you know. I haven't remembered the

       instance yet, but I know it's there somewhere. I just have

       the sense that I survived something. All my therapists

       think so.

She goes out the room in the hall. Allison is shaking her head

behind her back.

       TALKATIVE APPLICANT

       Oh God, a kitchen ! I hate kitchens, cooking, cleaning,

       anything feminine. I mean, it's probably my mother's fault.

While the applicant is going into another room, Allison is writing

something on a pad she is holding in her left hand. Underneath the

pad is a Polaroid camera, certainly the one we saw the flashlight

coming from.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

A nice clear room, with a comfortable vintage-looking couch.

A young woman is standing in the middle of the room, wearing a

white blouse and brown large pants, looking very discreet... too

perfect !

       PERFECT APPLICANT

       I think this could work. And if you feel the same, please

       give me a call.

Allison takes her picture with her Polaroid camera.

Later. Close-up on the pile of application forms. On the top of

the pile, the one concerning the woman we just saw, with her

picture stapled in the left top corner of the form.

Allison is sitting on the couch, looking through the files. She

has the file of the last woman in her hand. She stands up and

walks to the kitchen.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY

Allison picks up the phone and dials the number of the last

applicant, whose form is still in her hand. Then she sees Sam's

picture on the fridge door. She puts the form on the top of the

fridge.

Close-up of Sam's picture.

Allison takes the picture off the fridge door and starts dialing

again.

       SAM'S VOICE ON THE PHONE

       Hello, Sam Rawson. Hello ?

Allison puts the phone back on its hook on the wall. She sits down

on the floor crying, and still holding Sam's picture. She crumples

the picture into a small tight ball.

We see a pair of foot underneath a long light-grey dress walking

in the hall. Allison is still crying.

The woman knocks on the kitchen wall. Allison stands up with a

start.

       ALLISON

       Oh !... Hi !

We get a full view of the unknown visitor. It's Hedra Carlson. She

is wearing a black hat on her long light brown hair. She is

carrying a large bag held by a strap across her chest. She looks

very sweet and nice.

       HEDRA

       Hi !... The front door was kind of open. Are you Allison

       Jones ?

       ALLISON

       Yes... I'm Allie.

       HEDRA

       Oh, I'm Hedra Carlson. We spoke on the phone this morning.

She looks at Allison's face, where we still can see she's been

crying.

       HEDRA

       Are you sure you're okay ?

       ALLISON

       You know what ? I'm not. Would it be all right if you came

       back tomorrow ?

Hedra starts taking her arm, and then moves away inside the

kitchen.

       HEDRA

       Why don't you just... sit down.

       ALLISON

       No, I'm fine.

       HEDRA

       I'll make you some tea.

       ALLISON

       I just... I don't think I had lunch, that's all.

Hedra tries to get some water at the sink, but just gets a strange

noise.

       ALLISON

       It's only this one. The one in the bathroom works. Here...

She comes to the sink, and takes a wrench lying by the sink.

       ALLISON

       I use a wrench.

She squeezes the water faucet with the wrench. Hedra puts her bag

on the floor. Allison keeps on trying to open the faucet with her

wrench, but the faucet breaks off and showers both girls.

Hedra bends down to shut the main water tap under the sink.

The girls are both all wet.

       ALLISON

       Oh ! Wow !... Wow !... I'm so sorry.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Close-up on Hedra's dress and Allison's jacket drying on hangers

near the open window.

       HEDRA (voice over)

       If you need a reference, you can call them at Rizzoli.

Hedra gives some papers to Allison, seated on the sofa. Hedra is

wearing a red T-shirt and black pants, certainly borrowed from

Allison.

       ALLISON

       Oh, yes...

Allison looks at the papers.

       ALLISON

       Hedra... that's unusual.

       HEDRA

       I got terrible nicknames growing up, which I'm not telling

       you.

       ALLISON

       Not Hedy ? Like Hedy Lamarr ? That's exotic.

       HEDRA

       Well, I wasn't that exotic in grade school... as opposed to

       now, right ?

While Allison is reading the documents Hedra gave her, Hedra feels

the clothes hanging by the window.

       HEDRA

       They're dry.

She picks them up, gets them off the hangers, and gives her jacket

to Allison

       HEDRA

       Here.

       ALLISON

       Thanks.

Sam's crumpled picture falls on the floor from a fold in the

jacket. Hedra picks it up

       ALLISON

       Oh ! You can just toss that. I was just cleaning up. He's

       the reason why I'm looking for a new room-mate.

       HEDRA

       Oh !...

She sits down on the sofa next to Allison.

       HEDRA

       Do you know if there is a chance that you guys patch things

       up ? As... I do not want to move in and catch you being

       bound again, and then have things change. It would just be

       awkward.

       ALLISON

       Well, nothing going to change it, except for... maybe that

       my faucets will work. When can you move in ?

       HEDRA

       No, really ?

She looks very moved by what Allison just said. She takes

Allison's hand.

       ALLISON

       Congratulations.

       HEDRA

       Thank you.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - BASEMENT - INTERIOR DAY

Allison and Hedra are walking along a corridor in the basement.

Allison is wearing a black sleeveless T-shirt and beige pants.

Hedra is wearing a red dress with white small dots. Allison is

carrying two suitcases and Hedra a very large box. They all must

be empty, the way the girls are carrying them.

       ALLISON

       I've got one friend. Graham. He lives just upstairs...

       HEDRA

       A friend ?

       ALLISON

       Oh, not like that : he's gay. So, anyway, it's not a real

       friendly building, but, at least, there's no problem with

       privacy. 'Cause, I mean, you just close your door...

       HEDRA

       Yeah.

       ALLISON

       No problem.

       HEDRA

       I'll leave you alone, you know... I mean, whatever's good

       for you.

They've come to a row of stocking rooms, all protected by

partition and doors covered with chicken wire. They look like

cages, and that's exactly what the tenants call them. The two

girls drop their parcels on the floor. Allison takes a key out of

her pocket to open the padlock of her own private cage.

       ALLISON

       Anyway.

       HEDRA

       Wow !

Hedra crosses the corridor. On the opposite side from the row of

cages, a door that says : Incinerator Room and stuck on it, a

sign that says Use prohibited by law.

By this door, a pile of junks, probably left by a tenant. Hedra

picks up an old rusty metal lamp.

       HEDRA

       Hey, look, Allie, this could be good, huh.

A few moments later. Allison has resumed her tour of the basement,

walking along the corridors. Hedra is carrying the metal lamp she

found. They pass by the Laundry Room, where we've seen Allison

earlier chatting with Graham. Inside, a lady is working with her

laundry on a table.

       ALLISON

       Laundry room.

Another corridor.

       ALLISON

       I don't go in there at night. It's a bit creepy. It's okay

       in the day, but, still, lock yourself in.

Hedra looks at a key she is holding.

       HEDRA

       This one ?

       ALLISON

       No, that's mail key.

They've come to the elevator. An old machinery, enclosed in a

chicken wire cage, is working with a loud noise. Allison presses

the switch of the elevator

       HEDRA

       This is creepy.

       ALLISON

       Oh, it's not bad, it's just kind of old.

The elevator door slides into the wall, and the two girls get in

the cabin. Allison wants to close the inner door of the cabin, but

it does not want to slide back into closed position.

       ALLISON

       Sometimes this gets stuck and you have to use this

       screwdriver.

She takes a screwdriver hanging on a chain in the cabin. With it,

she works on the door lock, and succeeds in moving it.

While she rolls the inner telescopic door shut, she discovers that

another tenant has come into the cabin behind their back. He

doesn't look very friendly, with his bow-tie and his small

mustache. He is holding a newspaper.

       ALLISON

       Excuse me.

When the inner door is completely shut, the outer door slides

automatically into shut position.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - ELEVATOR CABIN - INTERIOR DAY

The elevator is moving up.

       THE TENANT

       Which floor ?

       ALLISON

       Eleven

The tenant presses a button on the switchboard by the door.

       HEDRA

       Fourteen, please.

The tenant presses another button. Hedra plays with her keys and

smiles to Allison.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - SPARE BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Allison and Hedra move a table out of the room. The table is

covered with various objets, and has apparently been used as a

desk. When they try to squeeze the table through the door, they

upset everything that is on the table down on the floor. They

scream and laugh.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY

Allison turns the water faucet on, and it seems to be working

perfectly.

       ALLISON

       Okay.

Hedra is kneeling by the sink, looking at the cupboard underneath

the sink. She stands up with an oval metal dish.

       HEDRA

       Look what I found.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - SPARE BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Hedra is kneeling on the floor, cleaning the dish she has found in

the kitchen. It shines so well that she can look at herself in it

as if it was a mirror.

Close up on the dish. Beside Hedra's face, we see Allison's face

coming to join her.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY

Hedra, just wearing her underwear, is talking on the phone.

       HEDRA

       I'm not sure. Hold on, I'll check.

Sitting on the floor, Allison is painting the old lamp Hedra has

found in the basement. An electric fan is working next to her.

Hedra puts the dress she is holding on the receiver, and whispers.

       HEDRA

       Allie, it's Sam.

Allison shakes her head No.

NEW YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY

Nice weather. Busy street, with shops and people. Allison and

Hedra are walking, eating ice cream cones. Allison is very

elegantly dressed. Hedra is more simply dressed and is still

wearing her old black hat.

       HEDRA

       Where do you guys learn to dress like that ? I mean, it's

       just so New York.

       ALLISON

       I think you look very comfortable.

       HEDRA

       Yeah, I never know what looks good.

NEW YORK - A CLOTHES SHOP - INTERIOR DAY

Hedra comes out of a dressing room, wearing a very elegant red

jacket.

       ALLISON

       Oh !... I think that looks nice

       HEDRA

       Yes ?

       ALLISON

       But I found this.

She gives her a red dress on a hanger, which she was holding out

of our view.

       HEDRA

       Oh !

       ALLISON

       I think you'd look great with that.

       HEDRA

       Okay

Hedra takes the dress and looks at it.

NEW YORK - A SHOE SHOP - INTERIOR DAY

We see only Allison's feet and legs. She is sitting on a chair

trying on some high-heel shoes. We see Hedra's feet coming toward

her. She is also wearing high-heel shoes.

       HEDRA

       Hey ! What do you think ?

       ALLISON

       I think you should take them.

Allison takes off the shoes she was trying on.

       HEDRA

       Oh God, you like them ?

We now see both girls' faces. Hedra is taking off the shoes she

was wearing.

       ALLISON

       Well, I think they go great with that dress.

       HEDRA

       You take them

She gives her shoes to Allison.

       ALLISON

       Well...

       HEDRA

       I'll just borrow them when I want to.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - EXTERIOR NIGHT

A full view of Allison's building in the New-York night. Actually,

it's not full night yet, because there is still some dark blue

light in the sky.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

The room is all dark, lit only by the street light coming from the

window. Allison walks into the room with a lampshade in her hand.

She puts the lampshade on the lamp by the bed. Then she switches

the lamp on. Apparently it is the lamp Hedra found in the

basement, cleaned and painted.

Allison looks at the books on the night-table.

She then moves across the room, puts her handbag on the bed, and

takes a medicine bottle from a small table. She puts it back and

takes a perfume bottle. She takes the plug off and sniffs the

bottle. With the plug, she puts a bit of perfume on her neck. She

puts the plug back on the bottle and the bottle back on the table.

She then takes a pair of earring from the table. She holds them on

her ears and looks at the effect in a mirror.

In the mirror, we see Hedra entering the room behind Allison.

Allison turns quickly around. Hedra is wearing a light night-robe

and her hair is wet

       ALLISON

       God! I didn't know you were home. I was...

Lying on the bed, there are a shoebox with a rubber band around

it, a key on a keyring, and a piece of paper. Apparently, Allison

has not noticed them. Quickly, Hedra throw the bath-towel, she is

holding, on those items, for Allison not to notice them.

       ALLISON

       I was... I was... God, I'm sorry. You haven't even been

       here two weeks and I'm already in your room.

       (ironically)

       I was just about to go through your drawers !

Hedra laughs. Allison puts the earrings, she was still holding,

back on the table.

       HEDRA

       That smells nice on you.

       ALLISON

       Oh, I hope you don't mind. I just... I always wanted to try

       that.

       HEDRA

       Oh God, no. anything you want... you want.

She takes her night-robe off. Allison seems embarrassed to see her

naked. She turns her eyes away from her.

       HEDRA

       Go ahead. Share and share alike.

       ALLISON

       Well... I don't really know about that. I'm an only child.

       Do you have... a big family ?

Hedra puts her nightdress on.

       HEDRA

       Hu-uh... There's just me.

She sits on her bed.

       HEDRA

       I am... Well, I was supposed to be a twin, but she was

       stillborn.

       ALLISON

       Oh, that's so sad.

       HEDRA

       I grew up like a part of me was missing.

She turns around sees the new lampshade.

       HEDRA

       Allie ! God !

She stands up to have a better look at the lampshade.

       HEDRA

       It's beautiful. Thank you. What do I owe you ?

She walks toward the little table.

       ALLISON

       Oh... nothing. It's just a little housewarming. It's like

       that.

Hedra picks up the earrings from the table, and gives them to

Allison

       ALLISON

       Oh no no...

       HEDRA

       Shhh !...

She puts the earrings on Allison's ears.

       HEDRA

       They look beautiful on you.

       ALLISON

       But I can't take these.

       HEDRA

       It's housewarming.

Allison looks at herself in the mirror.

       ALLISON

       Thanks, they're great.

The phone rings.

       ALLISON

       Excuse me.

She goes out of the room. While going out, she bumps into Hedra.

       HEDRA

       Oops !

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT

Allison picks up the phone.

       ALLISON

       Hello ?...

It's Sam. We only hear a few words of what he says.

       SAM (voice over on the phone)

       ... Talk to me...

       ALLISON

       No, Sam.

          SAM (voice over on the phone)

          Why not ?... Why not ?...

          ALLISON

          No, it's not a good time.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Hedra takes the shoebox from her bed, goes to a closet inserted in

the wall of the bedroom, and puts the shoebox on the top shelf of

the closet.

          ALLISON (voice over from the corridor)

          I'm not ready to see you. You're just going on something

          that's over.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT

Allison is still on the phone.

          ALLISON

          No, there's nothing to talk about anyway. Sam, there's

          somebody here right now...

We see Hedra's face peeking through the door of her bedroom.

          ALLISON

          All right ?... Okay... Bye.

She puts the phone down. Hedra is still peeking behind her bedroom

door.

          HEDRA

          Why don't we order some Chinese ?

Allison remains two seconds motionless with her hand on the

telephone, and then smiles and shakes her head Yes.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY

Through the open door of the bathroom, we see Hedra kneeling by

the bathtub, and apparently washing something in the bathtub.

The phone rings. Hedra rushes out of the bathroom. She is wearing

a orange T-shirt, a very large red boxer-short and white slippers.

          ANSWERING MACHINE

          Hi, this is Allison Jones. Please leave a message. Thank

          you.

A beep.

While listening to the machine, Hedra picks up a box on the

telephone table, takes a sweet out of the box, eats it, and puts

the box back on the table

          SAM'S VOICE ON   THE ANSWERING MACHINE

          Allie, are you   there ?... Allie, pick up. Allie, listen.

          Please, please   call me back. This is torture for me. I know

          you need me as   much as I need you. I love you. I'll do

       anything for you for us to get back together, just call me.

A click, meaning the end of the call. Hedra presses a button on

the answering machine, to erase Sam's message.

We hear some yapping coming from the bathroom. Hedra turns her

head toward the bathroom.

       HEDRA

       Buddy !

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Close-up shot of Hedra, kneeling by the bathtub and holding a big

puppy in her arms. She is rinsing it with mugs of water taken from

the bath.

       HEDRA

       Oh, yes, you're a good clean boy. You're going to cheer her

       up, are you ? Hmm ? You're going to cheer her up. So she'll

       let you stay.

While rinsing the puppy, she hugs and kisses it.

She hears the front door opening and turns her head around. She

says Shhh ! to the puppy, and whispers some other

incomprehensible words to it, then puts it back in the bathtub.

Close-up of a paper lying near the sink over Hedra's key-ring. The

paper is a bill from a shop called Pet Express, in New-York. It

was paid in cash, and the date is 8/16. It reads :

       YELLOW LAB PUPPY

          MALE, 6 WEEKS OLD, $ 350,-

                           TAX $ 29,75

                           $ 379,75

Hedra's hand crumples the bill and puts it in the waste-basket

underneath the other items already in the basket.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY

Allison enters the apartment. She is wearing a silver-colored

raincoat.

       ALLISON

       Yoo-hoo !

She closes the front door. Through the open bathroom door, we see

Hedra going from the waste-basket to the bathtub. She takes a

towel and wraps it around the puppy, still in the tub.

Allison puts her keys on the shelf by the door, puts her handbag

on the floor, and presses a button on the answering machine. A

beep and then :

       ANSWERING MACHINE

       No messages.

Behind Allison, we see Hedra coming out the bathroom carrying the

puppy wrapped in the towel.

Allison turns around, sees Hedra with the puppy and stops in her

tracks. She doesn't seem very happy, almost angry in fact.

       HEDRA

       I know I shouldn't have, but they were just giving him

       away... in the market. But they said I could bring him back

       to-morrow.

       ALLISON

       Well, I hope they meant it.

Hedra sits down on the floor.

       HEDRA

       Well... his name's Buddy. I had a dog named Buddy when I

       was little.

She gives a kiss to the puppy. She then looks up at Allison's

face, which doesn't seem very friendly.

       HEDRA

       Tomorrow, okay. I promise.

Allison walks away taking off her raincoat.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

We hear the puppy yapping. Hedra is sitting on her bed in the

dark. She stands up and peeks through the ajar opening of the

door.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT

Close-up at Hedra's peeking through the ajar opening of the door.

The puppy is still yapping.

The door of Allison's bedroom opens and Allison comes out. She is

wearing a light pink nightdress.

She slowly opens the kitchen door, bends down and picks up the

puppy.

       ALLISON

       Oh ! Come on.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT

Reverse angle shot of Allison picking up the puppy. She then goes

away, presumably to her bedroom, with the puppy in her arms.

       ALLISON

       Okay. Come on. Shhh !

Through the open kitchen door, we see, across the corridor,

Hedra's bedroom door closing itself.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Hedra, wearing pajama-looking pants and a sleeveless loose shirt,

comes in the room, carrying a tray. There is a mug on the tray, in

which Hedra is pouring honey from a plastic bottle. She comes to a

table, where Allison is working on two computers. The puppy is

sitting on Allison's laps.

Hedra stirs the mug with a teaspoon, and puts the tray on the

table.

       HEDRA

       You're working so hard.

Close-up on the screens of the computers. They show women dresses

designs.

       ALLISON (voice over)

       Myerson better refers some clients to me.

       HEDRA (voice over)

       He will, you're the best.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Hedra and Allison are lying on Allison's bed, with the puppy

between them. Hedra is wearing a pink T-shirt and red short pants.

The TV is on and we hear its sound faintly, without really

understanding the words.

       ALLISON

       God, Hedy, thanks. I never would've got it done without

       you.

Hedra is playing with a portable battery-powered fan. She puts it

down to play with the puppy.

       HEDRA

       I love helping.

She tries to move the puppy, who wants to move the other way.

       HEDRA

       Wait... Wait...

Allison takes her Polaroid camera to take a shot of the three of

them.

       HEDRA

       Oh yeah ! Family portrait.

       ALLISON

       Ready ?

       HEDRA

       Yeah.

Allison takes the snapshot.

Later in the night. There is a black and white movie on the TV.

       THE WOMAN IN THE FILM ON TV

       I lived a few weeks while you loved me. Goodbye, David.

The camera moves away from the TV, and we see Allison and Hedra

asleep on Allison's bed, with the puppy between them. Hedra moves

slightly in her sleep.

NEW-YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY

Allison and Graham are walking on the sidewalk of the street,

Graham pushing his bicycle. He has a canvas bag strapped over his

shoulder.

Graham's first sentence is actually heard in voice over the

previous sequence.

       GRAHAM

       Ready to kill her yet ?

       ALLISON

       Who, Hedy ?

       GRAHAM

       Hm-mm !

       ALLISON

       No, no, it's a lot of fun having a girlfriend again.

       GRAHAM

       I can tell. I was worried for a while that you were so

       down. You were starting to look like a Kennedy wife.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - MAIN LOBBY - INTERIOR DAY

They enter the lobby. We can see that Allison is carrying some

shopping bags. A lady is going out with a dog on a leash.

       ALLISON

       You were great, Graham. I just had to spend some time with

       her. She needed a lot of help moving in. Plus, I've been

       working like crazy. I promised I'm not avoiding you.

They enter the elevator. Two ladies are coming out. Allison has to

use the screwdriver to close the inner door of the cabin.

       GRAHAM

       Oh, I've got you cornered now. I've been meaning to come

       down and see you. I was on my way to ask you something.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - ELEVATOR CABIN - INTERIOR DAY

The cabin is moving up.

       GRAHAM

       Will you cat sit again ? I have to go to Boston this week-

       end for my cousin's wedding.

       ALLISON

       Fine. Sure, I'll watch Carmen.

He takes a keyring out of his pocket.

       GRAHAM

       Hey, I've made you a set. You know which one to try. And

       ignore the litter box this time, I do.

She laughs.

       ALLISON

       It's so cruel. We'll be fine.

       GRAHAM

       You know, I think I saw her the other day, your room-mate.

       You were leaving the building. Then I thought it was you.

       Your backpack. This jacket. I chased her down. But it was

       someone else. Someone very nervous.

       ALLISON

       Oh !... That's Hedy. I really freaked her out about people

       knowing she's living in the building. I would've had you

       down to meet her... but she's shy.

The elevator stops.

       ALLISON

       Well.

The outer door opens. Allison bends down to pick up her shopping

bags. She opens the inner door and takes the keys Graham is giving

her.

       ALLISON

       Friday ?

       GRAHAM

       That'll be great. I'll make dinner when I get back.

Allison closes the inner door.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE ALLISON'S APARTMENT -

INTERIOR DAY

Reverse angle shot of Allison closing the elevator inner door. The

outer door closes automatically. Allison walks along the hall

toward her apartment.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY

The front door opens. Allison bends down to pick up her shopping

bags and enters the apartment. The front door closes behind her.

She drops her keys on the little shelf by the door. She sees Hedra

in the doorway of the living room. Her hair is in a bun.

       ALLISON

       Hey, I thought you'd be at work.

       HEDRA

       No.

       ALLISON

       Don't tell me we have the same belt.

Hedra looks down at her belt. She seems embarrassed by something.

       HEDRA

       Well... Yeah ... Sorry... Listen, I have to talk to you.

       ALLISON

       You have to see these. Look, cookies for dogs.

       HEDRA

       Oh, they're great.

       ALLISON

       I had to get them. They're so great.

       HEDRA

       Can I just talk to you for a second...

       ALLISON

       Buddy !

Sam enters from the living room with the puppy in his arms.

       HEDRA

       I tried to let you know.

Sam puts the puppy on the floor.

       ALLISON

       What are you doing here ? Hedy !

       SAM

       But no, don't blame Hedy. It's not her fault, okay.

Hedra goes out of the hall into the living room.

       SAM

       I kind of forced my way in here. I had to see you.

Hedra comes back in the hall.

       HEDRA

       I've got to get out of here now. Unless you need me...

She looks back and forth to Allison and Sam, and gets just a No

head-shake as an answer from Allison.

       HEDRA

       Okay.

Hedra goes out of the apartment and closes the door behind her.

       ALLISON

       Why can't you just leave me alone ?

Allison takes her shopping bags and goes into the kitchen.

       SAM

       You've got to talk to me, baby. You just can't pretend I

       don't exist.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY

Allison puts her bags down on a table.

       ALLISON

       Easier that way, Okay ? Is that so hard to try to make it

       easier on me ?

       SAM

       But people screw up. People do something wrong. And I was

       wrong, I admit it. And you just... You cut me off. You

       don't take my calls. You don't answer my letters.

       ALLISON

       Wait a minute. You lied to me ! If she hadn't called, would

       I have found out ? I think that's really scary, okay ?

       Please, if you want to be nice, just stay away.

       SAM

       Okay. You know, I know that there is something that you

       just can put back together. I was hoping that this wasn't

       one of them.

       ALLISON

       Well, I guess it is. And... I didn't get any letter. So, I

       wasn't trying to punish you by not answering it. I just

       didn't get it.

       SAM

       Well, I sent it with the keys.

       ALLISON

       Well, I didn't get those, either. What did it say ?

       SAM

       Forget the letter. I love you. I can't exist without you.

       I have no excuse for what I did, Allie. You have to give me

       a second chance.

She goes into his arms. He hugs her. She start crying.

       ALLISON

       You really hurt me, Sam.

       SAM

       Shhh !

ALLISON'S BUILDING - EXTERIOR DAY

hugging each other.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE ALLISON'S APARTMENT -

INTERIOR DAY

Hedra is standing by the window, with a knee on the heater. She

seems very pensive.

An old lady comes out of the elevator, and looks at Hedra.

Hedra turns her head toward the lady. She picks up her bag, which

was sitting on the heater beside her, and moves away from the

window. She goes to the elevator and presses the call button.

A STREET IN NEW-YORK - EXTERIOR DAY

We are across the street from the Rizzoli bookshop, the shop where

Hedra is working.

RIZZOLI BOOKSHOP - INTERIOR DAY

Hedra, dressed exactly like she was in the previous sequence, is

dialing a number on the telephone on the wall.

A lady comes to her.

          THE LADY CUSTOMER

          Excuse me, can you tell me where the biography section is ?

          HEDRA

          Oh, yes, towards the front, against the wall.

          THE LADY CUSTOMER

          Okay.

The lady moves away from Hedra.

We hear Allison's answering machine talking in the telephone.

          ALLISON'S ANSWERING MACHINE (voice over)

          Hi, this is Allison Jones. Please leave a message. Thank

          you.

A beep.

          HEDRA

          Hi, Allie, it's me. I'm just calling to see if you're okay.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY

Close up shot on the answering machine. Then the camera moves away

from the telephone table and, in the living room, we see Sam and

Allison, standing in a close embrace and kissing each other. Some

pieces of clothing are already on the floor, and we see Allison's

foot stroking the back of Sam's leg.

          HEDRA (voice over on the answering machine)

          Call me at work. Yeah. Okay. My number's on the fridge.

          Okay, bye.

RIZZOLI BOOKSHOP - INTERIOR DAY

Hedra puts the phone back on its hook. She seems very nervous.

HOTEL ATHERTON - MAIN ENTRANCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

The Atherton Hotel is evidently a quite luxurious hotel.

Sam and Allison are walking on the sidewalk towards us and the

entrance of the hotel.

       SAM

       Say... Next month, that would give her enough time.

       ALLISON

       I don't know. Just got herself on hands. Haste wouldn't do.

       I'm sure she'll understand.

They enter the hotel.

HOTEL ATHERTON - LOBBY - INTERIOR NIGHT

Sam and Allison cross the lobby, hand in hand.

An old hotel clerk looks at them from behind his counter.

       HOTEL CLERK

       Good evening, Mister Rawson.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Close-up on the TV set showing a movie featuring James Stewart.

       JAMES STEWART (playing his character in the movie)

       I have an idea I must be in love with you. Has it hit you

       that way ?

Reverse angle shot on Hedra sitting in an armchair, with her bare

feet on another armchair. She is eating ice-cream from a large

plastic pot. On the floor beside her, the puppy is playing with a

tennis shoes. Hedra looks down at it and kicks it away with one of

her feet.

       HEDRA

       Hey ! It's not for you !

The puppy goes away yapping. Hedra has a mean look on her face.

       JAMES STEWART (voice over from the TV set)

       Would you like it to go on for always ?

       FEMALE CHARACTER IN THE MOVIE (voice over from the TV set)

       How does anything go on for always ?

       JAMES STEWART (voice over from the TV set)

       Well, one likes to think some things do.

Hedra keeps on eating her ice-cream, looking absently at the TV,

with the same mean look on her face.

HOTEL ATHERTON - A BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Sam is sitting on a chair, naked. Allison, also naked, is sitting

on his laps, facing him, and with her legs spread on either side

of the chair. She is moving up an down. They evidently are having

an intercourse.

Close-up on Allison's hand behind Sam's back. She is wearing her

engagement ring.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Hedra is lying naked in the bath. The bath is almost full, but hot

water is still pouring from the tap. Hedra, her eyes closed, is

humming some music.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Full view of the building.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - MAIN ENTRANCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

A Yellow Cab is parked in front of the entrance. On the sidewalk,

Sam and Allison are hugging and kissing.

Allison moves away from Sam and into the building. Sam goes back

into the cab.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT

The front door opens. Allison comes in and closes the door behind

her. She locks the door and puts the security chain on. She puts

her keys on the shelf by the door, and looks through her mail. She

stops near Hedra's bedroom closed door, because she notices there

is still some light in the room. She then goes to the telephone

table to look at the answering machine.

Still looking through her mail, she enters her bedroom.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Without switching the lights on, Allison puts her mail on a chest

of drawers.

       HEDRA

       Where the hell have you been ?

Allison gasps at that somber voice in the dark. Hedra switches the

bed-light on. She is sitting on Allison's bed, with her legs

covered by the sheet, and the puppy on her laps. She is wearing

her night-dress, with a pink sweater on her shoulders.

       ALLISON

       God, Hedy, what are you doing in my room ?

       HEDRA

       I've been waiting since six o'clock last night to hear from

       you. I'm worried sick. Buddy was crying. I thought I might

       as well come in here, so it calm down.

       ALLISON

       Sorry, I guess I just didn't think.

       HEDRA

       No, you didn't. There's such a thing as a phone, you know.

       This is New York. Things happen.

       ALLISON

       Okay, okay, I'm sorry. It was thoughtless, really. You're

       making me feel like I'm sixteen years old here.

She goes to the bed where Hedra is stroking absently the puppy.

She kneels down at the bedside.

       ALLISON

       Hey, are you okay ?

       HEDRA

       Yeah... Yeah. Just... forget it. So, I guess you've patched

       things up with Sam, huh ?

       ALLISON

       Yeah... Yeah, I made him suffer.

Hedra looks down at Allison hand stroking the puppy.

       HEDRA

       Is that an engagement ring ?

Allison stands up.

       ALLISON

       Right.

Hedra sighs, and moves the sheet away to get out of the bed.

       HEDRA

       Beautiful ring.

       ALLISON

       Thanks.

Hedra walks away from the bed. She gives a last look at Allison's

ring.

       HEDRA

       Really great.

She walks to the door.

       HEDRA

       I'm sure you'll be very happy ... you'll be very happy and

       I'll be alone.

       ALLISON

       No, no, wait a little. You'll find someone, Hedy. I mean,

       God, if I can...

Hedra is standing in the doorway and points to the mirror.

       HEDRA

       Why don't you look in the mirror ?... Huh ? Look !

She comes back into the bedroom. She forces Allison to look at

both of them in the mirror.

       HEDRA

       Look ! You're in a different league. I know that. You have

       this great personality. You have this great style. You're

       running your own business. You're always going to find

       someone. You'd have to be stupid to think that you

       wouldn't.

She puts her head in her hand.

       HEDRA

       Well, I guess you... you and Sam want to be together. So...

       I have to move out, right ?... No ?

       ALLISON

       Well, anyway, Sam's going to keep his place for a while. I

       know you just spent a lot on furniture.

       HEDRA

       Yeah, your timing is great, Allie, it's really great ! You

       promised me this wouldn't happen. Exactly what...

       ALLISON

       Nothing's happened, Hedy, come on. Look, I'll talk to Sam.

       Well... Well, maybe we'll move, I don't know. Maybe, we'll

       find some place like this, or... I don't know. But, we'll

       see, we'll figure something out. Okay ?

FONTANA FASHIONS OFFICE - MAIN HALL - INTERIOR DAY

Fontana Fashions is Mitchell Myerson's company.

Close-up on some feminine hands typing on an Apple computer

keyboard. We see various windows, showing models of female dress,

opening and closing on the screen.

       MITCHELL (voice over)

       They tell me they're nervous.

       ALLISON (voice over)

       Of course, they're nervous. They're salesmen. They want to

       be sold.

We see the whole room. It is a very big room with large white

columns supporting the ceiling, and large bay windows.

Girls are working in the background. Some are trying a new dress

on a model girl. Mitchell's assistant is typing on the computer,

with Allison standing near her. Her name is Barbara, and she is a

woman with brown hair and a sleek bob haircut. Mitchell is

standing a couple of feet away.

       ALLISON

       Let's set up a demo, to show them something. Something

       special, something different, you know. Maybe at night, you

       know. Open bar, open minds. That's F night.

Mitchell walks to the desk next to Barbara's one, where he starts

flipping the cards of a Rolodex.

       MITCHELL

       I'll set it up, I'll set it up. Maybe I... I'll call you

       tonight after I check on some things.

       ALLISON

       Great.

He takes a card from the Rolodex.

       MITCHELL

       8796, Knox. Knox ? What's this Knox ?

       ALLISON

       Oh no, that's Graham Knox. He is my upstair neighbor. That

       was just for last night. Oh, he's the first one.

       MITCHELL

       Well, I've got to admit, I'm very impressed.

       ALLISON

       Well, maybe you start spreading the word.

       MITCHELL

       You know, I can see I'm not going to be able to afford you

       any more.

He puts his hand on Allison's shoulder and walks away. Allison

smiles and then looks at what Barbara is doing.

       ALLISON

       Great. Press enter. That's it.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Low angle shot of Allison's building.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

In the dark, we see the shadow of Allison moving up and down on

top of Sam. She is slightly moaning.

Fade out.

Later. Sam and Allison are lying on the bed, naked and half-

covered by the sheet. Allison's head is resting on Sam's chest.

       ALLISON

       You thirsty ?

       SAM

       No.

She starts moving out of the bed.

       ALLISON

       I'll be right back, okay.

She stands up and puts a light night-gown on. She walks out of the

room.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Allison is filling a tooth glass from the tap of the sink.

Suddenly we hear voices. Allison seems surprised. We don't

understand the words, but we recognize Sam's voice, and then

Hedra's light laugh.

Allison slowly walks out, carrying her glass.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT

Hedra is standing at the door of Allison's bedroom. She is holding

a glass containing an orange liquid. She is wearing a night gown

and she is holding a book in her other hand.

       HEDRA

       Well, you'd know more about that than I would.

She laughs.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

The lights are switched on in the bedroom.

Sam is lying in the bed, still half-covered by the sheet. He is

drinking from a can.

Reverse angle shot of Hedra drinking from her glass. The night-

gown is slightly open and we can see that she is just wearing

panties underneath.

Allison walks behind Hedra. She is holding her tooth glass, and

with her other hand, she keeps her night gown well closed. Hedra

turns her head towards her.

       HEDRA

       Oh, hi !

       SAM (voice over from the bed)

       Allie, do you want a sip ?

Allison shows her own glass in her hand without answering.

Hedra looks at Sam and then at Allison. She seems slightly

embarrassed.

       HEDRA

       Oh well... Well I think I'll turn in. Goodnight, Allie.

She kisses Allison's cheek.

       HEDRA

       Goodnight, Sam.

She walks away toward her bedroom.

Sam turns himself around in the bed to lie on his back.

Before closing the door, Allison switches the lights off.

In a corner of the room, the puppy is wide awake and is sitting in

his basket.

Allison lies down on the bed. She hasn't taken her night gown off.

Close up shot on Allison's face lying on her back on the bed. She

seems worried.

Reverse angle shot of the fan spinning on the ceiling.

Fade-out.

Later. Allison is asleep, lying on her side. She is still wearing

her night-gown. Her hand is moving on the sheet, and apparently

does not find what it was looking for, because Allison suddenly

sits up on the bed.

We see Sam sleeping and lying on his back, half-covered by the

sheet. Allison looks at him and sighs.

We hear some strange noises. Allison gets up and off the bed.

We see her naked feet walking past the puppy's basket. Allison

opens the door. The puppy leaves his basket and follows her.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT

Allison crosses the hall, followed by the puppy. She stops, bends

down and picks it up.

She walks slowly to Hedra's door, which is partly opened. We hear

Hedra moaning.

In the mirror on the closet door, we see Hedra lying on her

stomach on her bed, half-covered by the sheet. She is

masturbating. She turns around to lie on her back.

Close up shot on Allison's face looking at Hedra. She seems half-

surprised, half-fascinated by what she sees.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Hedra is lying on her back in her bed. Her sheet is down to her

waist, showing her breasts. She still has one hand between her

legs.

The puppy yaps.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT

Close-up of Allison's face, looking slightly frightened. She puts

the puppy on the floor.

Reverse angle shot on the mirror in Hedra's bedroom. We see Hedra

sitting up on her bed.

Allison runs through the hall towards her bedroom. The puppy

follows her, but she shuts the door before it can gets in the

room.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Allison jumps into her bed and lies down. We can hear the puppy

yapping behind the door.

Allison hears the door opening. She puts her head on the pillow,

closes her eyes and pretends she is asleep.

Hedra walks slowly across the room towards the bed. She is wearing

her night gown.

We see Allison's shoulder moving slowly up and down, just as she

was really asleep.

Hedra remains a few seconds looking at Allison, then starts

walking back towards the door.

Close-up shot on Allison's face. Her eyes are closed, but, when

she hears the door closing, she opens them again.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Sam is fixing a broken piece of wrought iron on the balustrade on

the balcony. He is screwing a sleeve clamp to fix the broken piece

on the main body of the balustrade.

       HEDRA (voice over)

       They're ready.

       SAM

       Right, just a minute.

Hedra is coming out of the kitchen with a frying pan. She is just

wearing her night gown. She is stirring some scrambled eggs in the

pan.

       HEDRA

       They'll get cold.

She eats a piece of crispy bacon out of the pan.

       SAM

       All right, all right.

Sam climbs out of the balcony.

A wider shot shows Hedra back in the kitchen, cooking something on

the stove. Sam slides the window down, and then walks across the

room and into the kitchen. The puppy gets out of its basket and

follows him.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY

Allison gets out of her bedroom, fully dressed and ready to go to

work. She hears voices coming out of the kitchen.

       SAM (voice over)

       No, no, Rawson is a Norse name.

Allison opens the kitchen door.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY

Sam and Hedra are eating breakfast seated on either side of the

small kitchen table. The puppy is eating something off the floor.

       SAM (finishing the sentence he was saying in voice over

       while Allison was opening the door)

       Well, isn't this a thoroughly uninteresting conversation.

He looks up at Allison entering the room

       SAM

       Hey !

       HEDRA

       Hi !

       ALLISON

       We going ?

She walks to the sink, and picks up an orange. Sam gives her a

kiss on the cheek. She turns her head and doesn't respond to the

kiss.

Hedra comes toward them with a plate in her hand. She gives the

plate to Allison.

       HEDRA

       Scrambled or fried ?

Allison doesn't take the plate and shows her the orange. She seems

quite upset.

       ALLISON (whispering)

       This is fine.

She gets out of the kitchen. Sam turns his head towards Hedra and

then follows Allison.

Hedra walks a couple of steps towards the open door and listen to

the conversation going on in the living room

       SAM (voice over)

       Allie, sweetheart, this isn't all that urgent. You know, if

       you don't want to do this apartment thing today, it can

       wait till I get back.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Hedra is standing in the doorway leading to the kitchen, with the

plate still in her hand.

Reverse angle shot on the legs of Allison and Sam. The puppy is

playing between them, putting its nose on Allison's leg.

       SAM

       Why don't we get away together ? Drive to Box Camp ?

Reverse angle shot on Hedra bending down and slapping her thigh.

       HEDRA

       Buddy, come here, boy.

She takes a piece of bacon out of the plate and shows it to the

puppy.

Reverse angle shot on Allison and Sam.

The puppy doesn't respond at all to Hedra's call and food.

       HEDRA (voice over)

       Come on, three's a crowd, sweetie.

       ALLISON

       All right, Hedy, he's fine.

       (in a much lower voice, for Sam's ears only)

       Poor guy's doesn't who's who anymore.

Reverse angle shot on Hedra standing up and finishing her plate.

Then reverse angle shot again on Allison and Sam.

       SAM

       Well, wouldn't you like to take a day off... Renting a

       car...

       ALLISON

       No, I'm okay. I'm fine. I just didn't get a very good

       sleep, that's all. Nightmares. Okay ?

Sam gives her a very tender kiss, which she gives him back.

Reverse angle shot on Hedra looking very angry. She goes back into

the kitchen and puts her plate down. She then walks into the

living room, looking very casual.

       HEDRA

       You've got a good day for it if it doesn't get too hot.

She gives a light tap on Sam's back when she walks behind him. She

takes a food plate off Allison's desk, and starts walking away

towards the kitchen with the plate.

       ALLISON

       You don't have to do that, Hedy. You're doing enough

       already.

       HEDRA

       Oh, I don't mind. It's clean when you can't tell I'm here.

She enters the kitchen to put the plate down. She then comes back

into the living room.

       HEDRA

       Oh... Hey, if the eggs were okay, maybe you guys can trust

       me with dinner. Do you know when you'll be back ?

       ALLISON

       Oh, no, it's kind of an anniversary tonight. So I think

       we'll be eating out.

       HEDRA

       Really ? Well, that's great... Well, good luck.

We can see, by her expression, that Hedra is not very happy about

what she just heard, but she keeps a smiling face.

Sam and Allison walks out of the room.

Hedra wrinkles the front of her night gown with her nervous hands.

She walks slowly toward the hall.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY

Sam and Allison are going out of the apartment.

       HEDRA

       Goodbye.

Sam closes the door behind them. The puppy remains behind the

door, whining.

Hedra sits down on the floor, leaning on the wall near the door of

the living room.

       HEDRA

       Buddy, come here.

She taps her hand on the floor.

       HEDRA

       Come here, sweetie.

The puppy doesn't move away from the front door, and keeps on

yapping and crying.

       HEDRA

       I know... I know.

She seems very nervous. The dog keeps on yapping at the door.

       HEDRA

       Buddy, come !

She taps her hand on the floor in a more and more nervous way.

       HEDRA (angry voice)

       Come !

The dog doesn't move from the door, and keeps on yapping.

       HEDRA (calmer voice)

       Fine.

AN EMPTY APARTMENT - INTERIOR DAY

A large room in a typical old New-York apartment. Large windows

going almost to the ceiling. Through the windows we see roofs with

water tanks on them. The room is empty, save for a ladder and a

few tools.

The real estate agent is standing with some papers in his hand.

Sam and Allison are coming towards him from the other side of the

room.

        SAM

        But this is half the size for twice the price from your

        apartment.

        ALLISON

        It's easier this way, believe me. And this could be nice.

They walk away toward the exit of the apartment. The agent remains

standing on the same spot.

        SAM

        Can you imagine going from The Victoria to this.

NEW YORK - A STREET NEAR ALLISON'S PLACE - EXTERIOR DAY

A busy street in New York, with small shops with goods for sale on

counters on the sidewalk.

Sam and Allison are walking down the street.

        SAM

        Do you think we can smoke her out ?

        ALLISON

        This is such a mess. I just can't do it right now. I think

        I'm her only friend.

They turn the corner of the street, and we hear a scream. Sam and

Allison both lift their heads.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - EXTERIOR DAY

Low angle shot taken from ground level showing a woman running on

her balcony. She bends over the balustrade to look down.

        THE WOMAN ON THE BALCONY

        My God, what happened ?

Reverse angle shot showing what the woman sees from her balcony.

Buddy, the puppy dog, is lying motionless on the pavement, with a

group of passers-by around it. One of them points his finger to

the upper stories of the building.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE ALLISON'S APARTMENT -

INTERIOR DAY

Allison and Sam are running toward Allison's apartment door.

Allison opens it.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY

Allison rushes into the apartment, followed by Sam.

        ALLISON (yelling)

        Hedy !

She runs past the kitchen door. We see Hedra sitting at the

kitchen table. She stands up when she sees Allison.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Allison stops in front of the window. The window is open and the

broken piece of wrought iron, on which Sam was working earlier in

the morning, is missing, leaving a gap in the balustrade, a gap

wide enough for a puppy dog to go through.

       ALLISON (screaming and crying)

       He's dead ! Buddy's dead !

Sam climbs on the balcony.

Close up on the gap in the balustrade.

       HEDRA

       What ?

Hedra seems genuinely surprised. She still has the earphones of

her Walkman around her neck.

       ALLISON (crying)

       You left the window open. How could you do that ?

       HEDRA

       But I thought we could leave it open. I know you fixed it

       this morning.

Sam is still on the balcony, looking at the balustrade.

       SAM

       I thought I did.

       HEDRA

       It's me. I interrupted you when I called you in for

       breakfast. And Allie, it's my fault.

She starts crying.

Allison rushes out the room.

       HEDRA

       Allie !

       SAM (voice over)

       Allie !

Sam runs out of the room after Allison.

       SAM

       Allie !

Hedra walks to the balcony and slowly slides the window down.

Fade out.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Allison is lying in her bed with the sheet up to her neck. Sam

bends over her and gives her a light tender kiss on the lips. Then

he stands up. We hear him leaving the room and closing the door.

Allison turns her head with her eyes still closes.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT

Hedra is sitting on the floor in the dark, leaning on the wall.

She is sorting things and putting them in a box in front of her.

Hearing the musical noise of a plastic toy, we understand she is

putting the puppy's stuff away.

Sam comes out of Allison's room and, walking in the hall in front

of the kitchen open door, stops and looks at her.

       SAM

       Thanks, that pill helped.

       HEDRA

       Are you still going on that trip tomorrow ?

       SAM

       Well, she wants me to.

       HEDRA

       If I'd just let you finish your work this morning...

We can hear repressed tears in her voice. Then she starts crying

for real.

       SAM

       Listen, if she blames anybody, she blames me, huh ?

Sam kneels down.

       SAM

       Shh !

Sam takes her in his arms where she goes on crying. He slowly

stands up, still holding her in his arms. He leads her to her

room.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT

Outside Hedra's room. Sam is in the doorway. Hedra moves slightly

away from him and then hugs him even stronger.

Gently, he pushes her away from him. They almost kiss on the

mouth, but Sam takes her arms off his neck and goes out of her

room, where she stays. He closes the door behind him, and she

holds his hand on the doorknob. Then she moves her hand away and

the door closes. We hear her sobbing behind the closed door.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Allison is asleep on her bed, dressed with a short black slip and

black panty hoses.

The phone rings. Allison wakes up slowly, and, with her eyes still

closed, feels around on the night table to find the phone. She

eventually picks it up.

       ALLISON

       Hello ?... Hi, Mitch...

She raises her head.

       ALLISON

       What ?

She looks at the clock.

       ALLISON

       God ! I know... I'm... No, I'm just... I'm just running a

       little late.

She picks up the pill bottle on the night table and looks at it.

       ALLISON

       I didn't forget. I dunno... Just hold them till five,

       okay ? Thanks.

She puts the phone down.

She gets up and goes into the dressing room. She starts looking

for a dress. She rapidly goes out.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY

Through the open door of the bathroom, we see Allison looking for

a dress.

She then goes out of the bathroom, crosses the hall and open a

closet, in which more clothes are hanging. She picks up three

hangers with clothes on them.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

She enters her bedroom, carrying the hangers. She throws one of

them on the bed, and goes, with the two other ones, back into the

dressing room. She picks up a hanger with a light brown jacket,

and compares it with the one on the hanger she brought from the

closet in the hall. They are exactly the same. Then she picks up a

red dress, and compares it with the one she brought from the

closet in the hall. They're both the same. She looks a bit worried

by what she just discovered.

FONTANA FASHIONS OFFICE - MAIN HALL - INTERIOR DAY

Close-up on an Apple Computer screen, showing dress models. The

file is called Fontana Fashions.

       MITCHELL (voice over)

       You were terrific...

We see Mitchell, very smartly dressed, with a white Roman-collar

shirt and a black jacket. He is holding a glass of Champagne.

       MITCHELL

       ...but you know that, don't you ?

A large section of the main hall of Fontana Fashions Office has

been transformed into a reception room. Dresses are hanging on

racks. On a round table with a white tablecloth, many half-empty

glasses of Champagne, two silver bucket with Champagne bottles in

them, plates of petit fours, and a lot of flowers.

Mitchell and Allison are both standing in front of a large TV

screen, set on a hight stand, and showing the Fontana Fashions

computer files.

Allison, wearing a very smart black short sleeveless dress, puts a

video cassette back in its box.

       ALLISON

       Thank you.

Mitchell goes to the table, puts his glass down, and fill another

glass with Champagne.

       MITCHELL

       And here, I thought all the guys would resist you. As if

       anyone ever could.

He gives the glass to Allison, who doesn't take it.

       ALLISON

       Oh no, here, I've got to go. I'm just cleaning a bit.

       MITCHELL

       Hold it. Hold it. Not so fast. Now everybody under me knows

       more than I do. I hate that.

       ALLISON

       Well... Block up some time for me next week. Then... it's

       just a little late tonight.

Mitchell kneels down on the floor.

       MITCHELL

       Oh, please, please, just a taste.

He puts the glass on the top of his head

       MITCHELL

       Something simple. Right now.

He gives the glass to Allison, who takes it.

       ALLISON

       Okay... Something simple.

She walks to a table with an Apple computer on it, puts her glass

on the table, and sits down. Mitchell comes behind her, drinking

his glass, which he then puts on the table. He bends down behind

Allison, who starts typing on the keyboard.

       ALLISON

       All right... You know, this is just the Mickey-Mouse stuff,

       but it does come in handy.

Close-up on the computer screen. The Fontana Fashions file is

on. We see the outline of a model, then a small window appears on

the model. It says Are you sure you want to quit ? and below two

choices, Cancel or OK. Allison chooses OK. Fontana

Fashions file disappears, replaced by another window that says

Search by vendor, and in the bottom of the window, Enter Vendor

Name:, with an empty box underneath.

       MITCHELL (voice over)

       Huh-huh.

Back to Allison typing. Mitchell's head is just behind hers.

       ALLISON

       Okay. Enter the vendor's name.

       MITCHELL

       Oh !... Vendor...

He bends over Allison to type on the keyboard, encircling her with

his right arm.

       MITCHELL

       J-o-n-e-s... All..i...son.

Allison seems a bit embarrassed by this close physical contact.

       ALLISON

       Very good.

Close-up on the screen, where a new window titled Acc. Payable -

Summary. In the window, a data chart that reads as follows :

       ALLISON (voice over)

       See, here you go. Contract price, Payments to date,

       Balance outstanding.

Back to Allison and Mitchell looking at the screen

       MITCHELL

       Ho-ho. According to this, we should have paid you last

       Friday.

       ALLISON

       That's all right. Barbara will handle that.

       MITCHELL

       Not till I give her the word.

Allison turns to him, and seems not to like his strange smile.

       ALLISON

       Well, I hope you're satisfied with what I've done.

       MITCHELL

       So far.

He walks away from her and goes to the Champagne table.

       ALLISON

       But this is it. I mean, there ain't much more. Just maybe a

       little fine tuning, that's it. I have some free time now,

       if you want us to set up some meeting with your colleagues.

Using a napkin, he is drying a bottle of Champagne he just got out

of its bucket.

       MITCHELL

       I was thinking that maybe I want to keep you all to myself.

He throws the napkin on the floor, and comes back toward Allison

with the bottle of Champagne. He puts the bottom of the bottle on

Allison's bare shoulders. She shivers.

       MITCHELL

       Top her ?

       ALLISON

       What are you doing ?

He puts his other hand on her shoulder. Then he puts the bottle on

the table, and starts massaging her shoulders.

       MITCHELL

       That's just that you're so tight.

       ALLISON

       Mitch, please, don't. That's enough.

He grabs her from behind and squeezes her in his arms.

       ALLISON

       Mitch...

       MITCHELL

       Hey, look...

He kisses her neck.

       MITCHELL

       I've been a good boy, haven't I ? And you've been a good

       girl. We have nothing to prove any more.

He keeps on kissing her neck, and puts his hand inside her dress

to reach her breast. Allison seems to be on the verge of tears.

       MITCHELL

       This is your last chance to play before you're an old

       married lady.

       ALLISON

       Let me turn around, okay ?

She has a strange smile on her lips.

       MITCHELL

       That's better. That's better.

He stands up.

       MITCHELL

       Just a second... A second...

While she slowly turns around on her swivel seat, he starts

unzipping his pants, and lets them fall on his ankles, showing his

white trunks.

Allison, still   seated, is now facing him, her face at the level of

his crotch. He   takes her head to guide it toward his private

parts. Allison   looks up at him and then, with both fists and all

her might, she   hits him very hard between his legs. He screams.

She jumps from her seat and runs out of the room.

He falls on the floor, holding his private parts with both hands.

       MITCHELL

       Fucking bitch !

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Close-up on Allison, still in her black dress, and holding a glass

of wine.

       HEDRA (voice over)

       Here. Take this.

We see Hedra's hand giving some pills to Allison. She then

replaces the glass of wine by a glass of water.

       ALLISON

       I can't believe I didn't see it coming. It's just so

       humiliating.

       HEDRA (voice over)

       You're too nice, that's the problem. Men are pigs. I don't

       care how nice they seem. You always fall for that.

       ALLISON

       But what I did... It was like something inside taking over.

       It was scary.

We see Hedra standing near the mantlepiece. She is wearing an

orange T-shirt and a red skirt.

       HEDRA

       No, Allie, don't turn this around. You're the victim. He

       should pay for this.

She kneels on the floor in front of Allison.

       ALLISON

       He'll pay. I set up all my programs, so they have to

       eventually.

Hedra laughs.

       HEDRA

       What ! I'm not talking about getting paid, I'm talking

       about getting even.

       ALLISON

       You don't understand. It's the contacts more than the

       money. When I just took the job for the word of mouth and

       now that's gone. It's just like he's put me back to square

       one.

       HEDRA

       Only if you let him. But you won't let him, will you ?

       ALLISON

       What can I do ?

       HEDRA

       Oh, Allie...

She opens Allison's purse and takes her address-book.

       HEDRA

       Of course, Sam's away. I didn't want to say anything... How

       he could go on that trip the day after Buddy died.

She walks to the telephone table in the hall, flipping the pages

of the address-book.

       HEDRA

       Especially when it was his fault.

Since the bedroom door is wide open, we can see Hedra in the hall.

She picks up the phone and starts dialing.

       HEDRA

       Hello ! May I speak with your husband, please ?

       ALLISON

       Who are you calling ?

She gets up from the sofa on which she was sitting.

       HEDRA

       Yes, I know it's late. Tell him it's Allison Jones, he'll

       take the call.

Allison has come to the telephone table.

       ALLISON

       Who are you talking ?

Hedra shushes Allison with her finger.

       HEDRA

       Listen, you pathetic shit. Do you want to hold on to your

       business ?... No, you listen to me this time, asshole ! If

       you trash me around town, you're fucked and your family is

       fucked, too ! You got that ? It won't just be you.

She puts the phone down, and starts laughing.

       HEDRA

       Let me tell you, he is pissing in his p.j.'s right now.

       ALLISON

       Gee, Hedy, I hope you never get mad at me.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - EXTERIOR DAY

High-angle shot of the building, taken from the roof of the

building across the street. We see Allison and Hedra coming out of

the building. From this height, they look like a couple of ants !

       ALLISON (voice over)

       Hedy, we really have to talk.

       HEDRA (voice over)

       Allie, please, I have a surprise for you.

       ALLISON (voice over)

       Hedy !

A STREET OUTSIDE JOHN DELLAR'S HAIR SALON - EXTERIOR DAY

Allison and Hedra are walking on the sidewalk. They stop in front

of the shop of John Dellar's Hair Salon.

       ALLISON

       Oh, Hedy, I'm not really up for this today.

       HEDRA

       What ?

She puts her hand on Allison's neck.

       HEDRA

       No, no, no, this is going to be fun. It'll make you feel

       better, promise. Okay ? And I'm paying. Go.

She takes Allison by the hand and drags her to the door of the

shop.

       HEDRA

       Let's go.

Allison tries to resist Hedra.

       ALLISON

       Oh, Hedy.

       HEDRA

       It'll be fine, come on.

They enter the shop.

JOHN DELLAR HAIR SALON - INTERIOR DAY

Allison is seated in front of a large mirror. An attendant is

taking the protection garment off her shoulders.

       ALLISON

       Thank you.

She smiles. She seems happy and puts her hands through her hair.

Suddenly she stops, and the smile disappears from her mouth. She

looks up in the mirror at someone descending the stairs from the

upper level of the shop. She makes the swivel chair turn around to

have a better look at the staircase.

Close-up on Hedra going down the stair. Her hairdo is so much like

Allison's one that she almost looks like a twin sister of Allison.

Back to Allison's thunderstruck face.

       ALLISON

       You've got to be kidding.

A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY

Allison and Hedra are walking in a busy street. If Hedra was not a

bit shorter than Allison, one could think they were twins. Allison

seems angry.

       ALLISON

       You just should've asked first.

       HEDRA

       Well, I wanted it to be a surprise.

They stop at a newspaper stand.

       ALLISON

       Can I have the Consumer Market, please.

       NEWSPAPER STAND ATTENDANT

       Sure.

The attendant picks up a magazine from a rack and Allison picks up

some other magazines at random.

       HEDRA

       This feels so good on my neck. I didn't think you'd mind.

Allison is paying the attendant.

       ALLISON

       Thank you... please.

Hedra seems to be worried by Allison's very cold reaction to her

surprise. She seems even a bit sad.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Allison is looking at the dresses hanging in the closet.

       HEDRA (voice over)

       I'm going to take a shower.

Allison walks out of her room into the hall.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY

Through the open door of the bathroom, we see Hedra turing the

water faucet on in the shower cubicle, then taking her belt off.

She closes the door of the bathroom.

Allison stealthily runs into Hedra's bedroom.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Allison enters the room, and looks around. She walks to the closet

and starts looking through Hedra's clothes. Suddenly, she notices

the shoebox on the shelf above the clothes.

Close up on the shoebox and then on Allison's hand picking it up.

Allison opens the shoebox. She sits down on the bed, and starts

looking through the content of the box. She takes several papers

out of the box and looks more closely at them.

Close-up on the documents Allison is looking through. Several

photographs, and then a black and white photograph of two twin

girls with a puppy between them. The twin girls are the one we saw

at the very beginning of the film.

Allison looks very attentively at the picture. She puts the

documents she is holding into the lid of the box and starts

looking at the rest of the documents.

Close-up on an envelope that reads :

                            ELLEN BESCH

                        441 OCEANSIDE EAST

                             TAMPA, FLA

Allison seems surprised by the name on the envelope.

       ALLISON

       Ellen Besch...

She looks through all the other envelopes. On another envelope, a

computer-generated label has been glued on the original Ellen

Besch address. It reads :

                  AUTOMATED MAIL PO BOX NEW YORK

                           PO BOX 72810

                        c/o 845 W. 93RD ST

                         NEW YORK NY 10024

She puts the envelopes back into the box, and picks up other

documents. They are newspapers clippings.

Close-up on the clipping Allison is holding. There is a picture of

two young twin girls, and above, a title that reads :

         NINE-YEAR-OLD BESCH TWIN DROWNS AT FAMILY PICNIC

And underneath :

                       Services were held Friday at

                          Hope Lutheran Church for

                      nine-year old, Judy Besch, of

                          Mapic Drive, who drowned

                        Tuesday at a family picnic.

                      Circumstances surrounding her

                            death remain unclear.

                      A eulogy was delivered by Dr.

                   William Starr, the family's doctor

                         for many years. Among the

She puts the clippings back into the box and picks up another

envelope.

Close-up on the envelope, which reads :

                               ALLIE JONES

                         768 W. 74TH ST. #1103

                           NEW YORK, NY 10017

       ALLISON (voice over)

       Sam !

We see Allison's hand looking inside the already opened envelope

and taking a key-ring out.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Close-up on Hedra's hand turning the water faucet off.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Allison is reading the letter which was with the keys.

Close-up shot on the letter. It was written on a Hotel Atherton

stationery. The close-up is too close for us to be able to read

all the words, but we still can read :

                              DEAR ALLIE,

                            I KNOW HOW MUCH I HU

                         AND I KNOW HOW LITTLE MY

                       CAN DO TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT.

                          BUT PLEASE FOR THE SAKE

                     WHAT WE HAD, GIVE ME THE CHANCE

                                TO SAY THEM.

                          YOU FORGIVE ME, MAYBE I

                     TOO. I NEVER WILL, IF WHAT I'VE

                           HAS RUINED EVERYTHING.

                    I'LL CALL YOU IN A FEW DAYS,IF I

                       DON'T HEAR FROM YOU.

                         I LOVE YOU, ALLIE

                                SAM

                        DAY YOU GAVE ME I'M

Allison reads the letter very attentively. Suddenly she hears some

noise coming from the bathroom and turns her head towards the

noise.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY

The bathroom door is opening slowly

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Allison puts the letter back in the envelope, the envelope back

into the box. She then puts everything back into the box, closes

the box and puts it back on the shelf.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY

Allison comes out of her bedroom, picks up her handbag and starts

unlocking the safety chains and locks on the front door, while,

through the open bathroom door, we see Hedra, wearing a long white

shirt, taking care of her hair in front of the mirror.

       HEDRA

       Do you want me to fix you something before I go ?

       ALLISON

       Oh, no, thanks. I'm just going up and visit Graham.

       HEDRA

       Okay.

       ALLISON

       Okay.

       HEDRA

       I love myself like this.

       ALLISON

       Have fun.

Allison opens the door and goes out.

       HEDRA

       Yeah.

Allison closes the door behind her.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Close up on the mirror. We see Hedra still fixing her hair

       HEDRA

       I love myself like this.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE GRAHAM'S APARTMENT -

INTERIOR NIGHT

Allison rings the doorbell of Graham's apartment. Getting no

answer she knocks on the door. Getting no answer again, she walks

away from the door.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - MAIN STAIRCASE - INTERIOR NIGHT

Allison is going down the stairs. She opens a service door, and,

hidden by this door, watches Hedra waiting for the elevator.

Allison rushes back to the staircase.

High-angle shot of the whole staircase, with Allison running down.

NEW YORK - THE STREET OUTSIDE ALLISON'S BUILDING - EXTERIOR NIGHT

This is the street outside Allison's building, probably seen from

the entrance of the building, or very near it.

Hedra, coming from behind the camera, crosses the sidewalk,

towards the street.

       HEDRA

       Taxi !

She raises her hand to stop a taxi cab.

Allison, also coming from behind the camera, hides behind the

corner of a wall to watch Hedra.

       HEDRA

       Hey !

A yellow cab stops and Hedra climbs in it.

As soon as the cab is gone, Allison rushes from her hiding spot

and runs to the street, with her hand raised.

       ALLISON

       Taxi !

YELLOW CAB - INTERIOR NIGHT

We are inside Allison's cab. In front of us, through the

windshield, we see the back of Hedra's cab driving in the heavy

traffic of New York.

       ALLISON (voice over)

       Don't lose her.

Reverse angle shot on Allison seated in the back of the cab.

Allison bends slightly to speak to the driver.

       ALLISON

       It's very important. She has something of mine.

NEW-YORK - A QUIET STREET - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Compared to Allison's neighborhood, this is a very quiet district.

Almost no one in the streets. No shops.

Hedra's cab has just stopped in front of a grim building with a

fire escape. Hedra walks out just as Allison's cab stops at the

corner of the street. Allison walks out of her cab. Both cabs

drive away, and Allison starts following Hedra from a distance.

Medium shot of Allison following Hedra.

Hedra reaches her destination, another grim building, and goes

down a stairway, starting from the street and going down to the

basement of the building. A strong man with a ponytail and glasses

is guarding the entrance. But he lets Allison go down the steps.

Other people follow Allison.

BASEMENT NIGHT CLUB - INTERIOR NIGHT

Allison goes down the last steps to the basement, which actually

is a sort of night club. We hear some religious-sounding music

with drum rhythms.

The place is quite dark, but flashes of light enable us to see

that all the customers are very smartly dressed, men wearing

elegant suits and neckties, and women wearing elegant dresses.

They seem to be watching some sort of a show.

A young woman, wearing a black sleeveless dress and long black

leather gloves, notices Allison and comes towards her.

       THE WOMAN

       Do you want to play ?

       ALLISON

       No, thanks.

Allison walks away, followed by the young woman. She passes near a

cage, inside which we see a middle-aged man. The man gets his hand

through the bars of the cage, and strokes Allison's cheek. Allison

jumps, rubs her cheek and moves away from the cage.

Behind Allison's back, we see the young woman, who was following

her, coming to the cage and speaking to the man inside.

From where she is, Allison can see what's going on at the bar,

without actually be seen by the people seated on high stools along

the bar.

Reverse angle shot on the bar itself, and more precisely, on

Hedra, seated on a stool, with a man, seated on another stool,

stroking her cheek.

       HEDRA

       Come on, Jim.

The bartender, a bald bare-chested young man, turns toward Hedra.

       THE BARTENDER

       Allie !

Hearing her name, Allison starts and looks at the bartender

       THE BARTENDER (voice over)

       Hey, Allie ! Regular or diet ?

Hedra turns towards the bartender.

       HEDRA

       Diet.

A flash of light enable us to have a better view of Hedra's

companion, the man she called Jim. He looks a bit like Sam.

       JIM

       Something's different.

Hedra smiles.

       HEDRA

       Yes.

       JIM

       Yes.

Allison is staring at the couple

       HEDRA (voice over)

       Yeah, you look like my sister's boyfriend.

Jim laughs.

GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

We hear the first sentence said by Graham in voice over the

previous sequence.

       GRAHAM

       Jesus, Allie, what is it ?

Graham is opening his front door to Allie, who enters the

apartment, but stays near the open front door.

       ALLISON

       God, you've got to help me, Graham. You've got to tell me

       what to do.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT

Hedra opens the front door and enters the apartment.

       HEDRA

       Allie ?

She closes the door and locks it.

       HEDRA

       I'm home.

She drops her keys on the shelf near the door and crosses the

hall.

The camera moves into the living room.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Through the open door to the kitchen, we see Hedra crossing the

kitchen to go into the living room.

       HEDRA

       Allie ?

She seems slightly drunk and doesn't control her movements very

well. Before entering the living room, she takes a blue bag in the

kitchen (maybe something to eat) and drops it on a table. But,

being a bit nervous, she actually drops the bag on a small bowl

containing various objects, and the bowl falls on the floor and

breaks into pieces.

       HEDRA

       Allie ?

Hedra looks at the fallen bowl and bends down to pick up the

debris.

       HEDRA

       God...

The bowl has fallen near the air vent. It is exactly the same as

the one which, earlier in the film, had enabled Graham to hear Sam

and Allison's conversation.

Hedra kneels down to gather the pieces of the broken bowl. We hear

a faint voice. Hedra raises her head, trying to find out where

this faint voice comes from.

First, we don't understand the words the faint voice is saying,

then it becomes clearer. It's Allison's voice speaking to Graham

in his apartment.

       ALLISON (voice over from the air vent)

       It's like looking at myself. And she lies. I found a

       shoebox in her room.

Hedra understands that the voice is coming from the air vent, and

she moves closer to it.

       ALLISON (voice over from the air vent)

       Nothing she told me is true. The twin that she said died at

       birth. It was in an accident when she was nine.

Hedra moves a brass knob on the air vent, to open it wider and to

have a better understanding of the words.

GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Graham and Allison are sitting on a couch. Graham has a glass in

his hand, and Allison a cup.

       ALLISON

       And she stole a letter that Sam wrote me. I have to do

       something.

Graham gets up from the couch.

       GRAHAM

       Get rid of her.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Hedra is still kneeling on the floor, with her ear close to the

air vent, listening to the conversation between Allison and

Graham.

       GRAHAM (voice over from the air vent)

       Call the police if you have to. If she steals thing you

       have to get her out of the place.

We hear steps. Hedra looks up at the ceiling, and then slowly

stands up.

GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Graham is pouring something we don't see in a glass.

       ALLISON

       You're right. I'll tell her tonight.

Allison gets up from the couch, with her cup in her hand.

       ALLISON

       I can't just throw her out on the street. I mean, she

       obviously needs help.

       GRAHAM

       She is a lunatic, Allie. She's got to go. Do it tonight.

GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Close-up on the front door. The door slowly opens and a hand

covered by a black glove comes through the opening of the door. We

hear the conversation going on between Graham and Allison.

       ALLISON (voice over)

       It's just that I feel responsible for her somehow. I'm the

       only one she has. Someone like her parent.

GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Back to Graham and Allison.

       GRAHAM

       Allie, either she's gone by Saturday, or I go to the

       police, okay ?

Allison laughs.

       ALLISON

       That was very impressive.

       GRAHAM

       I can be butch when I have to. I got it from my mother.

GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

The room is very dark and only lit by the street lights through

the window. A shadow moving in the dark. We hear the conversation

coming from the living room.

       GRAHAM (voice over)

       Look, if you worry about her, I've got a friend who's a

       shrink. Maybe he can help her.

The shadow moves away from the dark corner where she was hiding :

it is Hedra, who starts walking cautiously in the room.

       ALLISON (voice over)

       Oh God ! Maybe after I talk to her, she just leaves.

       GRAHAM (voice over)

       Do you want to sleep here tonight ?

       ALLISON (voice over)

       Oh, don't tempt me. No, I just needed to talk it out.

GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Allison and Graham are both standing in the middle of the room.

       ALLISON

       Thanks.

She walks to a table to pick up her purse.

GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Sensing that Allison is going to leave, Hedra walks back into a

dark corner to hide herself.

       ALLISON (voice over)

       She's not going to chase me out of my own place.

       GRAHAM (voice over)

       When's Sam coming back ?

GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Graham is carrying his cat in his arms.

       ALLISON

       Oh, tomorrow.

Allison picks up her purse and they start walking towards the

front door.

GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

They walk along the corridor, Graham still with his cat in his

arms.

       GRAHAM

       That's good.

       ALLISON

       Yeah.

       GRAHAM

       Oh, this is a little embarrassing, but since we're letting

       our hair down... Those old air vents between our apartments

       carry sound. It's a weird acoustic thing.

They've stopped walking.

       ALLISON

       Oh... What do you hear ?

He does not answer but he makes a face and then laughs, which is a

good answer to Allison's question. She puts her head down in her

hand, feeling a bit embarrassed.

       ALLISON

       Oh, no ! Oh no ! I'm... I'm sorry.

       GRAHAM

       Big deal. I am sorry. I should've mentioned it sooner.

       ALLISON

       I'm so sorry.

       GRAHAM

       You're sure you want to go down there ?

       ALLISON

       Yeah. She's my problem. I'll handle it.

She starts walking again towards the front door. Graham follows

her.

Allison opens the door.

       ALLISON

       Thank you for the tea. I'll see you tomorrow.

       GRAHAM

       Okay.

Allison goes out and Graham closes the door behind her, and then

locks it.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - MAIN STAIRCASE - INTERIOR NIGHT

High angle shot of the staircase. Allison is walking down the

stairs.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT

The apartment is all dark. The front door opens and Allison walks

in, and closes the door behind her.

       ALLISON

       Hedy ?

She puts her keys on the shelf by the door.

       ALLISON

       Hedy ?

She walks around the hall, looking in all the rooms.

       ALLISON

       Hedy ?

We hear a little noise, and we see Allison turning her head.

Close up on a mirror-covered door opening slowly. At that very

moment, we, the spectators, do think we are still in Allison's

apartment. But actually, we are in :

GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

The door opens slowly with a light squeaking noise. We hear

Graham's voice talking on the telephone in the next room.

       GRAHAM (voice over)

       This is serious, it's a lot more serious than I thought.

       No, I know you can't diagnose over the phone.

The camera moves away from the door, then looks into the living-

room, where Graham is sitting in the dark, only lit by the street

lights coming through the window, and talking in the telephone.

       GRAHAM

       I don't know. I don't even know what hyper-vigilant is. No,

       I've never met the woman. She could be infantile or

       paranoid, whatever. I don't know...

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Close-up on the air-vent. We see Allison's hands sticking pieces

of large adhesive tape on the air-vent. We hear the faint voice of

Graham still talking on the telephone, but we don't understand the

words.

Larger shot of Allison sitting on her bed and sticking the pieces

of tape on the air-vent.

GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Graham is still talking on the phone.

       GRAHAM

       I tell you what, let me go downstairs. If I call you from

       there, will you talk to my friend ? She can tell you better

       than I can. Right, okay.

We hear some noise in the background, and Graham turns his head

towards the noise.

Quick reverse angle shot on the corridor seen from the living-room

door. It looks empty and quiet.

Back to Graham on the phone.

       GRAHAM

       Thanks. So... so, all right... so, so you might hear from

       us. Love to Jack. And you're not charging me for this.

He puts the telephone down on his set on the table, turns his head

again in the direction where he heard the strange noise, and gets

up. He thinks it may be the cat and calls her with a soft gentle

voice.

       GRAHAM

       Carmen...

He gets out of the room into the corridor.

GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Graham makes little noises with his lips to attract the cat. He

suddenly hears the wooden floor squeak behind him. He turns his

head.

We see Hedra coming out of a room and walking towards the front

door. Since we see only the back of her head, she can easily be

mistaken for Allison.

       GRAHAM

       Allie !

She doesn't turn her head and just wave her hand.

       HEDRA

       Goodnight.

She has almost reached the front door, when Graham realizes that

something is queer about the girl's attitude.

       GRAHAM

       Hedy ?

She turns around. She seems very panicky suddenly. She starts

fumbling with the locks of the door, and drops the safety bar on

the floor.

       HEDRA

       I'm sorry...

       GRAHAM

       Wait... hey, wait, it's okay. Take it easy. Take it... We

       just want to get you some help.

Hedra is kneeling down, fumbling with the fallen safety bar.

       HEDRA

       No, Please... Please... I didn't do anything wrong.

Graham is walking slowly towards her.

       GRAHAM

       Okay, take it easy.

       HEDRA

       I'm sorry, I didn't do anything.

       GRAHAM

       No problem.

Hedra suddenly stands up with the safety bar held firmly in both

hands. She strikes Graham first in the stomach, then, as he

doubles up with pain, she strikes him again on the shoulder.

Graham falls on the floor, and she gives him a final blow on the

head, leaving him unconscious on the floor.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Allison is standing by the desk, talking on the telephone and

holding the telephone set with her other hand. We hear a beep.

       ALLISON

       Hello, Mr. Besch, you don't know me, my name is Allison

       Jones. I think my room-mate Hedra is your daughter. Ellen.

       I'm not sure, really. She's... She's been under a lot of

       stress lately... And... Well... Huh... Huh... God... I

       really, really would not get into this on the answering

       machine. Could you please give me a call ? Or her ? I'm

       sure you have the phone number. It's 2-1-2-5-5-5-9-8-1-4.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT

The front door opens, and Hedra comes in.

       ALLISON (voice over, still talking on the telephone)

       I'll really appreciate, I'll really. Don't say I called.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Allison, still on the phone, turns her head towards the front

hall.

       ALLISON

       Oh, thank you.

She puts the phone down.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT

Hedra closes the front door and walks slowly across the hall

       ALLISON (voice over)

       Hedy ?

Hedra enters the bathroom and closes the door behind her.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Allison is standing near the window, apparently not knowing

exactly what to do next.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Hedra is sitting naked under the shower. She is playing with a

jewel ring and humming softly some musical tune.

We hear several knocks on the door. Hedra doesn't react at all.

       ALLISON (voice over)

       Hedy ?

Hedra answers without moving her head.

       HEDRA

       What ?

Apparently, Hedra has not spoken loud enough above the noise of

the shower, because Allison knocks again on the door.

       ALLISON (voice over)

       Hedy, are you all right ?

       HEDRA

       I can't hear you.

She has spoken with a very soft voice, and apparently Allison

hasn't heard her, because she opens the door, and walks slowly

towards the shower

       ALLISON

       It's okay, it's just I was starting to worry. You've been

       in here so long. I'm making some tea. Do you want some

       tea ? Camomile.

Hedra turns slowly her head towards Allison and smiles.

       HEDRA

       Yeah... that'd be great.

She turns the shower off, and stands up. She picks up a towel.

Allison turns her head, apparently feeling embarrassed to see her

naked.

Close up on the basin, full of water, and where Hedra's clothes

are soaking. The water is red with what looks like blood.

       HEDRA (voice over)

       I'm not feeling really well.

Hedra, wrapped in a large bath towel, has noticed that Allison has

been looking at the blood in the basin.

       HEDRA

       Mine always comes when I'm wearing something nice.

She walks slowly across the bathroom. When she passes near the

basin, she notices that a small part of her clothes are not inside

the basin, and she moves it back inside.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT

Still wrapped into the bath towel, Hedra walks slowly out of the

bathroom, followed by Allison.

       ALLISON

       Are you crampy ? Sometimes tea helps. Something warm. We

       could talk.

Hedra has reached her room's door, and she turns around.

       HEDRA

       About what ?

Hedra walks into her room followed by Allison.

       ALLISON

       About Sam and I wanting this place for ourselves...

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Hedra has not switched the light on in the room. The room is just

lit by the street light coming through the window.

       ALLISON

       ...It's just crazy keeping two places like this.

Hedra sits on the bed. She is wearing a night shirt and a large

sweater over the night shirt. (NOTE - This could be considered as

a continuity goof. Apparently, Hedra has been able to change from

the bath towel to the night shirt and sweater in less than a

second !)

       HEDRA

       Well... Well, I... I thought you wanted a long engagement

       so you could make sure you can trust him again.

       ALLISON

       Well, frankly, I think that's my business. I'm sorry, but

       it is.

Hedra cracks her knuckles.

       HEDRA

       Huh-huh... It's me, isn't it ? I'll change, Allie. I can

       change.

       ALLISON

       No, that's not it at all. You've been a good room-mate.

       It's just... This is the man I'm going to marry. I want us

       to start our lives together.

       HEDRA

       Well... He will cheat on you again, that's a promise. And

       when he does, don't come running to me, okay ? Cause...

       I've had it with you. You're so fucking weak !

Suddenly, she has a very menacing face. Allison, still standing

up, looks down at her with a very hard stare. Hedra, seeing that

stare, calms down and laughs.

       HEDRA

       I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

The phone rings, but Allison, who is still looking down at Hedra

with her very hard stare, doesn't move. Hedra turns her head in

the direction of the phone.

       HEDRA

       Allie ?

Hedra now has a very sweet look on her face. She gets up and out

of the room.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT

Hedra picks up the phone from the little table in the hall.

       HEDRA

       Hello ?

Allison enters the room from Hedra's bedroom.

       ALLISON

       Is it Sam ?

We hear a male voice over the phone. We quickly understand it's

Hedra's father.

       HEDRA'S FATHER (voice over on the telephone)

       Ellen, is that you ? Talk to me, or your mother. Honey, we

       miss you. We want you to come home.

       HEDRA (with a deep menacing voice)

       Don't call here again.

       HEDRA'S FATHER (voice over on the telephone)

       Ellen, listen. We'll stop sending the cheques if you don't

       come. I promise, no doctors this time. Just come.

Hedra puts the telephone down. She doesn't move for a couple of

seconds, then looks at Allison, trying to look more casual than

she actually is. She has a little nervous laugh.

       HEDRA

       Obscene phone call. New York !

The phone rings again. Hedra picks up the receiver and slams it on

the table. Then she presses on a button on the telephone set to

cut off the communication.

       HEDRA

       Find someone else, jerk !

Allison walks to the telephone table.

       ALLISON

       I'm expecting a call from Sam. He might be coming in

       tonight.

       HEDRA

       Just for a little while, okay. Sam will call back if it's

       busy.

Hedra hugs Allison.

       HEDRA

       I'm sorry, Allie.

She moves away from Allison, looking falsely casual.

       HEDRA

       It's no big deal. I'll find some other place. You know, I

       just... I don't want you making a mistake.

       ALLISON

       I understand. Hey, we'll still be friends. We'll keep in

       touch.

       HEDRA

       Sure.

Allison walks away to her room.

Hedra picks up the telephone set from the little table, without

putting the receiver back on its hook. We hear several short beeps

coming from the telephone. With one nervous movement, Hedra tears

the cord off the wall socket. Then she walks slowly into her room.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

A little later. Hedra is lying in her bed, writing something in a

notebook. She is humming a song. Her other hand is resting on the

telephone set on the bed.

The phone rings. Hedra picks it up immediately, not to let it ring

more than once.

       HEDRA (whispering)

       Hello ?

       SAM (voice over on the phone)

       Allie ?

       HEDRA

       No, it's Hedy.

HOTEL ATHERTON - A BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Sam is lying on the bed, still dressed in his suit and necktie. He

is talking on the telephone.

       HEDRA (voice over on the phone)

       Where are you ? Where are you ?

       SAM

       Oh... I just got in from the airport. Is she asleep ?

       HEDRA (voice over on the phone)

       Yeah...

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Hedra gives a quick look at the clock on the night table.

       HEDRA

       It's after two. Do you want me to wake her ?

       SAM (voice over on the phone)

       No, tell her to surprise me.

HOTEL ATHERTON - A BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

       HEDRA (voice over on the phone)

       Okay.

       SAM

       Okay.

       HEDRA (voice over on the phone)

       Okay, I'll tell her.

       SAM

       Goodnight, honey.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

       HEDRA

       Goodnight, Sam. Sleep well.

She slowly puts the phone down and plays a little with it.

HOTEL ATHERTON - MAIN ENTRANCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Close up on a pair of female legs and feet with stiletto heels

shoes.

The heels clicks on the sidewalk, and we see the figure of a woman

walking away from us, and towards the entrance of the hotel. No

one else is in the streets at this time of the night. The woman is

wearing a grey raincoat.

The woman enters the hotel.

HOTEL ATHERTON - A BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Sam is sleeping, covered by the sheet up to his waist, and

apparently naked underneath.

The door opens slowly. The woman in the grey raincoat enters the

room. We have already guessed she is Hedra.

She closes the door and puts the key on the night table.

She remains motionless for a couple of seconds, looking at Sam,

then she slowly starts to take the raincoat off. She is completely

naked under the raincoat.

She slides under the sheet of the bed, close to Sam. Sam moans in

his sleep. He turns slowly towards Hedra, who starts kissing him

on the chest.

       SAM (sleepy voice)

       Allie, Allie... what are you doing ?

Hedra goes down Sam's body, still kissing him. When she gets

between his legs, even if the room is very dark, we understand she

is performing oral sex on him.

Sam moans with pleasure.

       SAM

       Oh... Oh... Jesus !... Oh... Gee...

Suddenly, Sam realizes that something may be wrong. He gives an

anxious look at Hedra.

       SAM

       Allie ?

Hedra raises her head from Sam's private parts.

       HEDRA

       No, not Allie.

She resumes what she was doing. Sam would like to push her away,

but he is so close to his climax that he can't do it.

He has his orgasm, with Hedra not moving away from between his

legs.

She only raises her head when she is sure it is over. She gives

him a light kiss on the pubis and smiles.

Then she moves up in the bed, her head finally resting near Sam's

one. Sam is breathing very hard. Hedra strokes him on the chest,

and kisses his cheek.

Then she gets up and off the bed, and puts her raincoat back on.

She picks up a half-full glass on a table and drinks from it, what

looks like beer. Then she eats something from a plate on the same

table.

Sam breathes normally again and moves slowly on the bed. He lies

on his side, facing away from Hedra.

       HEDRA

       Hey !

With the glass still in her hand, she walks to the bed

       HEDRA

       Hey, sleepy guy.

She puts the glass on the night table, and kneels on the bed. She

start stroking Sam's shoulder.

       HEDRA

       I knew it.

       SAM

       Knew what ?

       HEDRA

       I told her. Guys like you don't change. You can't be

       faithful. And now she'll know.

While talking, she keeps on stroking his face. Sam doesn't react

to her caress.

       SAM

       She'll know what ?

He switches on the light on the night-table. He then turn around

to face her.

       SAM

       That you came up here and pretended to be her ? My God,

       what is this hair ? What is this supposed to mean ? You're

       in her clothes. You're wearing her perfume! For Christ-

       sake !

He jumps out of the bed, and starts putting his clothes on. Hedra

remains seated on the bed, drinking her glass.

       HEDRA

       You knew it was me. Come on ! You knew and you didn't care.

       Well, I think she should know that.

       SAM

       You think she's going to thank you for that news, do you ?

       HEDRA

       Well, I don't expect you to understand her friendship.

She puts her glass on the night table, and gathers her shoes to

put them back on her feet.

       SAM

       She can't... she can't stand you, for Christ-sake !

       HEDRA

       That's not true.

       SAM

       Oh, bullshit !

       HEDRA

       Huh-huh.

She shakes her head no.

       SAM

       You're too needy. You're always cleaning. You're constantly

       in her face.

       HEDRA

       She needs me. Who was there for her when her boss almost

       raped her ?

       SAM

       What ?

       HEDRA

       Could you care of her ? You were off on a business trip or

       screwing someone.

       SAM

       She never said a word to me about that.

After his pants, Sam has put his shirt back on.

Hedra gets up from the bed where she was still sitting.

       HEDRA

       That's right, she told me.

She sits back on the bed.

       HEDRA

       So... don't try and make me think that we're not close. We

       lean on each other and we... we protect each other. We're

       best friends.

       SAM

       You're nuts, you know that ? Yes... I think you're out of

       your skull, that's right.

       HEDRA

       Yeah, well, sticks and stones...

He comes near the bed and bends down to pick up something. Hedra

rushes on him.

       HEDRA

       Sam !

He pushes her away from him.

       SAM

       Don't touch me !

She sits back on the bed.

       HEDRA

       I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look, I know you want to save face. I

       won't tell her, okay ? Just... Just pick up the phone and

       call her and tell her you're going back to your ex-wife, or

       something. And I won't say a word, okay ?

       SAM

       Yeah... Well, you won't have to say a word, sweetheart,

       because I'm going to tell her myself.

He walks to the night-table and picks up the telephone. She throws

one of her shoes towards him. The shoe hits the wall just above

his head.

       HEDRA (yelling)

       No !

He rushes towards her, ready to hit her.

       SAM

       Fucking bitch !

But, before he reaches her, she strikes him very hard in the face

with her other shoe. The stiletto heel of the shoe enters his left

eye, and, behind the eye, certainly enters his skull and his

brain, because, instantly after the blow, Sam falls heavily on his

back on the floor, where he remains motionless and unconscious.

With her bare foot, Hedra touches his cheek.

       HEDRA (softly)

       Hey !... Hey !

HOTEL ATHERTON - LOBBY - INTERIOR NIGHT

Close up on Hedra's feet walking on the rug. She's wearing both of

her stiletto heels shoes.

Hedra goes down some steps and reaches the hotel reception desk.

The same hotel clerk, that we saw earlier in the film, when Sam

and Allison came together into the hotel, is talking on the phone.

He is talking in a soft voice, so we can't understand exactly what

he's saying.

But, when Hedra walks in front of his desk, he puts his hand on

the receiver microphone, and says, in a louder voice :

       HOTEL CLERK

       Goodnight, Miss Jones.

Without turning her head, Hedra waves her hand.

       HEDRA

       Goodnight.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Close up on the clock on the night table : it says 06:22.

Allison slowly wakes up to some noise in the apartment.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY

Allison comes out of her bedroom, wearing a long sleeveless pink

night shirt. She seems to be naked underneath.

She walks around the room, looking in every room which door is

open.

       ALLISON

       Hedy ?... Hedy ?

She eventually finds her in the living room, vigorously cleaning

the mantlepiece. Hedra is wearing a long plain gray dress and red

rubber gloves. Allison remains at the door of the room.

       ALLISON

       Hedy ?

Hedra looks up at Allison, but doesn't stop her cleaning.

       HEDRA

       Oh, hi ! I hope I didn't wake you. I got an early start.

       ALLISON

       No, Hedy, I didn't mean for you to move out today.

Hedra looks around the room.

       HEDRA

       Oh, there, I think that's it.

She goes out of the room into the hall.

       HEDRA

       I hope you don't mind. I'm storing some of my stuff in the

       cage downstairs.

She resumes her vigorous cleaning in the hall, starting with the

small shelf by the front door.

       HEDRA

       That way, I won't have to bother... You see what I mean...

       You know... I mean...

Allison has come near Hedra.

       ALLISON

       Sure, that's fine. Look, I'm really sorry it didn't work

       out.

Hedra has stacked her stuff near the front door. She picks them

up : a red suitcase, a cardboard box and a large paper bag. She

has taken her rubber gloves off and keeps them in one hand.

       HEDRA

       Well, I'd better get this stuff out of here.

Allison walks to the door.

       ALLISON

       I'll help.

She opens the door.

       ALLISON

       We can have breakfast when you get back.

Hedra walks out of the apartment. Allison closes the door, but

remains behind it, lost in her thoughts.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - BASEMENT - INTERIOR DAY

Hedra is rapidly walking along a corridor, carrying her stuff.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - INCINERATOR ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Close up on the open red suitcase. Inside, all the clothes that

makes Hedra look like Allison.

Hedra takes the clothes out of the suitcase and puts them into the

open incinerator. Then she sprays some lighter fluid over the

clothes.

Close up on Hedra's hands striking a match on the side of a

matchbox. She throws the match into the incinerator, and long

flames immediately start on the clothes.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY

Allison is fixing breakfast. She has cut some fruits into small

pieces and she puts them in the bowl of the blender. We hear some

music from the TV in the background.

Allison walks to a cupboard on the wall to pick up a spices jar.

The door leading to the living room is open, and the TV is on.

Allison gives a quick look at the TV, on her way back from the

cupboard to the kitchen working bench.

Allison puts a bit of spices from the jar into the blender, closes

the lid and starts the blender.

       MALE TV REPORTER (voice over from the TV set)

       And now, Morning News-break...

The rest of the words of the TV reporter are lost, covered by the

noise from the blender. But the voice of a female reporter, being

slightly louder, can be heard over the blender noise

       FEMALE TV REPORTER (voice over from the TV set)

       Police found the body of a man brutally murdered early this

       morning.

Allison shuts the blender off, and walks to the open door to watch

TV.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Close up on the TV screen, showing the reporter, standing, with

her microphone in hand, near the entrance of the Atherton Hotel.

       Identification of the victim, a white male of around 30

       years of age is pending notification of next of kin.

a banana.

       FEMALE TV REPORTER (voice over from the TV set)

       A witness I spoke to just right here said...

Reverse angle shot on the TV.

       FEMALE TV REPORTER (voice over from the TV set)

       ...he heard the sound of a struggle emanating from room

       612...

Reverse angle shot on Allison.

       FEMALE TV REPORTER (voice over from the TV set)

       ...around four o'clock this morning.

Allison suddenly realizes that the room number is Sam's one. She

rushes to the telephone set on the wall near the refrigerator.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY

Allison dials very nervously a number on the phone.

       HOTEL CLERK (voice over from the phone)

       Atherton Hotel.

       ALLISON

       Sam Rawson's room, please, room 6-12..

       HOTEL CLERK (voice over on the phone)

       I'm sorry, there's been an accident. I think you should

       speak to the police.

She doesn't even wait for the end of the sentence, and drops the

phone, letting the receiver hang on its cord. She rushes out of

the kitchen.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - INCINERATOR ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Hedra is leaving the room, carrying her stuff. Behind her, the

incinerator door is wide open, and we see a bright fire inside.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - BASEMENT - INTERIOR DAY

Across the corridor from the incinerator room, Hedra reaches

Allison's private cage. She drops her stuff and opens the

padlock.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Allison is bending over the toilet bowl and vomiting.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - BASEMENT - INTERIOR DAY

In the cage, Hedra takes a boot out of the cardboard box. Then

she takes a sock out of the boot, and delicately, takes a black

hand gun out of the boot. She puts the gun in the paper back,

above some clothes.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Allison is still vomiting in the toilet bowl. She slowly raises

her head from the toilet bowl, trying to catch her breath.

She sees Hedra's pair of stiletto heel shoes. Underneath one of

the heels, there are some traces of blood on the tile floor of the

bathroom.

Kneeling on the floor, Allison takes the shoe to look at it more

closely. Then she screams and throws it away, knocking the other

shoe down on the floor.

She is still kneeling on the floor, crying, when the door opens

and Hedra enters the room. Allison raises her head to look at

Hedra.

       HEDRA

       Allie ?

Hedra sees the stiletto heel shoe behind the toilet bowl, where it

has been knocked away.

       HEDRA

       What are you doing down there ?

Allison remains kneeling on the floor, just supporting herself on

her arms.

       ALLISON

       Oh... I just suddenly felt sick. It was the funniest thing.

       I hope I'm not pregnant.

Hedra walks towards Allison to help her stand up.

       HEDRA

       Let me help you.

Allison stands up.

       ALLISON

       Oh, that's all right, I'm fine.

       HEDRA

       I'll get some water.

Hedra walks to the basin, but wraps her hand in the bottom of her

dress before touching the water tap.

Allison walks out of the room.

       HEDRA

       Wait !

Allison stops at the door, and turns around toward Hedra.

Close-up on the mirror above the basin, showing Hedra and Allison

standing next to each other.

       HEDRA

       Drink some.

Allison takes the tooth glass and drinks. Hedra strokes her

shoulder.

       HEDRA

       Okay ?

Allison puts the glass down and shakes her head Yes. Hedra

strokes the back of her head.

       HEDRA

       Feeling better ?

       ALLISON

       Yeah. I can go out for a while. I feel much better now.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY

Allison walks out of the bathroom, followed by Hedra.

       HEDRA

       I thought you said breakfast ?

Allison has reached the front door, and she starts unlocking the

door.

       ALLISON

       Oh, it's in the blender. I've got to go out.

Hedra looks at Allison thin sleeveless night shirt and smiles.

       HEDRA

       Dressed like that?

       ALLISON

       I'm out. I'm just going to go upstairs and see Graham. He

       called while you were out.

Hedra looks at Allison with a very strange expression on her face.

She can see the tears on Allison's face.

       HEDRA

       Well, still, if you're not feeling well, you should wear

       more than that.

       ALLISON

       Maybe you're right.

She walks away to her room. Hedra puts her hand on her face.

       HEDRA

       Oh...

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Allison enters her room coming from the hall.

       HEDRA (voice over from the hall)

       Leave the door open so we can talk.

Allison grabs a pair of pants and puts them on.

Hedra enters slowly in the room, carrying the large paper bag

where she has put the gun.

Allison takes her night shirt off. She is now naked from the waist

up. But she grabs a sweater and puts it on.

       HEDRA

       You know why I think you're sick ?

While talking, Hedra slowly slides her hand into the paper bag,

takes a pair of black gloves out of the bag and puts the bag down

on the floor.

       HEDRA

       You're upset about Sam.

Slowly, Hedra puts the black gloves on her hands.

       HEDRA

       You know Sam's dead, don't you ?

Allison turns around to face Hedra.

       HEDRA

       Yeah, we don't have much time.

She picks up the bag and walks to a chest of drawers. She puts the

bag on the floor and opens the top drawer.

       ALLISON (crying)

       You didn't... you didn't do it, Hedy, did you ?

Hedra is taking white pantie and bra from the drawer

       ALLISON (crying)

       You couldn't have him !

She falls down, sitting on the floor and crying.

       ALLISON

       Why ?... Why ?

       HEDRA

       Allie, he came in my mouth. Then he tried to beat the shit

       out of me because I wanted to tell you.

She slams the drawer shut, and opens another one.

       HEDRA

       You know, it was an accident. But he deserved it.

She claps her hands.

       HEDRA

       Okay, come on. The police will be here soon.

Allison doesn't move and remains seated on the floor.

       ALLISON

       But... but you shouldn't run. That'll only make it worse. I

       know you weren't yourself when you did this, Hedy.

Hedra laughs.

       HEDRA

       I know. I was you.

She points her gloved finger to Allison, and then looks at herself

in the mirror.

       HEDRA

       Who is this Hedy anyway ?

She turns around, and walks away from the mirror towards Allison.

       HEDRA

       No one's seen her. She's not on the lease. There's not even

       a fingerprint of hers here. I've been cleaning like crazy.

       You have to come with me, Allie, or they'd put you away.

       ALLISON

       Hedy, it'll never work. Besides ... people have seen you.

       We just can't tell. We'll go to a lawyer or a doctor and

       they'll explain it to the police, or something.

Hedra, who is now very upset, knocks everything, that was on top

of the chest of drawer, with a long sweeping movement, down on the

floor.

       HEDRA

       No.

She bends down and takes the gun out of the paper bag.

       HEDRA

       Why are you making me do this ?

She snaps a cartridge into the chamber of the gun.

       HEDRA

       We're friends, Allie. You could be in a lot of trouble

       without me. But I'm not going to leave you.

She walks to Allison and kneels on the floor besides her, pointing

the gun to her head

       HEDRA

       That wouldn't be right. I won't leave you. Okay, let's go.

       Up ! Up ! Up !

She slaps her face.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE ALLISON'S APARTMENT -

INTERIOR DAY

Hedra leads Allison along the hall. She is carrying her paper bag

in one hand and the gun in the other hand. She still has her

gloves on. Allison is carrying a small plastic case.

       HEDRA

       Go ! Go-go-go !

They reach the elevator and Allison is ready to press the call

button, but Hedra moves her away towards the staircase.

       HEDRA

       No-no, up to Graham's. Come on. No-no, he's already

       involved.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - MAIN STAIRCASE - INTERIOR DAY

They climb the stairs. Hedra is pushing Allison with her gun.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE GRAHAM'S APARTMENT -

INTERIOR DAY

They reach Graham's front door. Allison rings the bell, waits a

couple of seconds and turns around.

       ALLISON

       Nobody's home.

Hedra takes some keys out of her bag and gives them to Allison

with the gloved hand that is still holding the gun.

       HEDRA

       Use these. Come on, come on, hurry up. Go !

Allison takes the keys and unlocks the door.

       ALLISON

       He must be sleeping. We were up late last night.

Hedra seems very nervous. While Allison is unlocking the door, she

keeps looking around her and pressing Allison's back with her gun.

Allison opens the door, and enters the apartment, followed by

Hedra.

       ALLISON

       Graham ?

       HEDRA

       He can't hear you.

Hedra closes the door behind them.

       HEDRA (voice over)

       Wait till you see me.

Hedra comes out of the bathroom, with a dark towel on her head.

The cat crosses the corridor and enters the bathroom.

Hedra puts her towel down : her hair, instead of being red like

Allison's, is now dark brown.

       HEDRA

       Your color was beautiful, but I can't go around looking

       like you any more, can I ?

She smiles.

GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Hedra enters the living-room.

       HEDRA

       Okay now, Allie, don't laugh.

She walks in front of the window, and makes a couple of dance

steps.

       HEDRA

       Ta-dah !

Reverse angle shot on Allison, tied up in an armchair with duct

tape. Each one of Allison's arms is tied on each armrest of the

armchair. Her legs are tied on the legs of the armchair, and her

chest is tied on the back of the armchair. There is also a piece

of tape across her face to keep her mouth shut.

Hedra laughs and turns the TV set on. The screen shows a

documentary about African fauna. Hedra turns the volume slightly

up.

       HEDRA

       How's that ? Good ?

She puts the remote control on the armrest of the armchair, within

easy reach of Allison's right hand. Allison doesn't move at all.

       HEDRA

       22 and 24 are the movie channels. I've got to cash a pay

       cheque. So I'll only be gone an hour. I know how you hate

       to be alone. Okay... Are you good and comfortable ? All

       right.

She walks away from the armchair, takes the towel off her neck and

down on the back of a chair. She takes her purse.

       HEDRA

       So, well... When I get back, we'll do your hair, too.

       Okay ? Be good. Bye.

She gets out of the room.

Allison moves for the first time : she turns her head around, then

looks back at the TV screen.

Reverse angle shot. On the TV screen, close up of a lion yawning.

Reverse angle shot. Allison looks at the remote control on the

armrest.

Close up on the remote control. Almost at the top of the remote

control, we see the two volume control buttons : up and down. And

under those buttons, we see the two channel control buttons.

Close up on Allison's face looking at the remote control.

Close up on Allison's right hand moving the remote control on the

armrest, to get the volume control buttons within reach of her

forefinger. She presses the up button.

On the TV screen, we see the volume bar graph going up on the

picture of a crocodile. And the volume of the music goes up too.

Allison looks at the remote control again.

Close up on Allison's forefinger pressing one of the channel

control buttons.

On the screen, we see a different channel : a comic movie. A

couple is having dinner in a restaurant and the waiter pours the

water bucket on the man.

Another channel. A woman is sleeping. A telephone rings.

Reverse angle shot on Allison pressing the channel control

buttons. We hear a male voice for a couple of second, then Allison

changes the channel again.

The TV screen seen from behind Allison's hand dialing on the

remote control. There is a cartoon on the screen. Then another

channel showing the concert of a rock music band.

Close up on Allison's face looking at the screen and then at the

remote control in her hand.

Reverse angle shot on the TV set. The volume bar graph is going up

again until it reaches the end of the graph. The volume of the

sound of the rock music is very high.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE GRAHAM'S APARTMENT -

INTERIOR DAY

We hear the rock music very loudly in the empty hall.

The front door of apartment 1206 opens slowly. A man with glasses

on his nose peeks into the hall. He seems very annoyed by the

noise.

BANK OFFICE - HALL - INTERIOR DAY

Close up on the hand of Hedra writing Ellen Besch on the back of

a cheque on the cashier's counter. In front of her, we see the

hands of the cashier girl on the other side of the glass

partition.

       CASHIER GIRL (voice over)

       What's the part this time ?

Larger view of the bank office hall. Hedra is standing in front of

the cashier's desk. We see the cashier girl through the partition

glass. Behind Hedra, a man is waiting for his turn, reading a

newspaper.

       HEDRA

       Excuse me ?

Through the opening at the bottom of the partition, she gives her

cheque to the girl.

Closer shot. Now we are on the cashier's side of the partition,

and we see Hedra's face through the glass.

       CASHIER GIRL

       You're an actress, right ? You're never the same person

       twice.

Reverse angle shot. We are now on Hedra's side of the partition,

and we see the cashier girl through the glass : she is a blonde

girl about the same age as Hedra. She puts her finger on her own

hair.

       CASHIER GIRL

       I like it. I just thought the other was more you.

Reverse angle shot. Cashier's side.

       HEDRA

       Well, maybe next time I'll try blonde.

Reverse angle shot. Hedra's side. The cashier girl smiles.

       CASHIER GIRL

       Really ? I'm flattered. Thanks.

A male bank clerk, sitting at a desk behind the cashier girl,

stands up and walks to the partition glass.

       BANK CLERK

       Miss Besch ?

       HEDRA

       Yes ?

       BANK CLERK

       A man's been calling here. Says he's your father.

Reverse angle shot. Cashier's side. Hedra seems worried by what

the man is saying.

       BANK CLERK (voice over)

       Might even come to New York if you don't call him.

Hedra runs away from the counter.

       BANK CLERK (voice over)

       Miss Besch !

GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

On the TV set, the rock band is still playing with the sound

volume very loud.

Reverse angle shot on Allison, trying to free herself from the

armchair where she is tied up. But the duct tape is strong enough

and her jerky movements don't bring any result.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE GRAHAM'S APARTMENT -

INTERIOR DAY

Outside Graham's apartment. We hear the loud rock music very

clearly. The building manager is standing by the door, with the

neighbor from apartment 1206 behind him. The neighbor has his

glasses hanging around his neck on a string.

The building manager rings the bell. Then he bangs on the door

with his fist.

       BUILDING MANAGER

       Hey !

GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Allison turns her head towards the front door and try to speak

through the tape stuck on her mouth.

       ALLISON

       Mmmm !

She starts moving again to free herself from the armchair, but she

doesn't succeed.

The bell rings again. Allison turns her heard towards the front

door.

A BUSY STREET IN NEW-YORK - EXTERIOR DAY

Hedra is walking very fast on the sidewalk. She passes a fruit

shop and bumps into a pedestrian girl, but doesn't stop to

apologize.

       THE PEDESTRIAN GIRL

       Jerk !

Hedra keeps on walking very fast. She seems worried.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE GRAHAM'S APARTMENT -

INTERIOR DAY

The manager has a key ring with many keys in his hand. He is

sorting them trying to find the right key to the apartment.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - MAIN LOBBY - INTERIOR DAY

Hedra is crossing the lobby, walking very fast.

She reaches the elevator and presses the call button.

GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

On the TV screen, a video clip with loud rock music behind.

Reverse angle shot on Allison, still trying to free herself from

the armchair.

GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Allison hears the key moving in the keyhole and turns her head

towards the front door.

Close up on the video clip : a man is running, apparently chased

by men armed with spears.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE GRAHAM'S APARTMENT -

INTERIOR DAY

Hedra just came out of the elevator and is closing the inner door

of the cabin. She turns the corner of the hall and suddenly sees

the manager and the neighbor near Graham's door. She runs towards

them and yells.

       HEDRA

       Oh !

The apartment door is wide open, but, when they see Hedra, the two

men don't enter the apartment. The neighbor goes back into his own

apartment, but the manager remains just outside the apartment.

       BUILDING MANAGER

       You live here ?

Hedra closes the door to talk to the manager, but she doesn't lock

it.

       HEDRA

       No, no, I'm just watching the place for the week-end like

       that. It's on a timer. Huh... Huh... I'm sorry.

       BUILDING MANAGER

       I have to register a complaint.

       HEDRA

       Please, I'll turn it off. I will.

She enters the apartment and closes the door shut behind her.

GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Allison turns her head towards the front door.

Hedra enters the room, walking very fast. She drops her purse on a

chair and walks to the TV set. She switches it off. Then she walks

slowly towards Allison, with a quite menacing face.

She gives Allison a very hard slap in the face. She kneels down in

front of her, and shakes her shoulders a couple of times. Then she

stops but remains kneeling on the floor, while she's talking to

her.

       HEDRA

       How could you do that ? Everything I've done, I've done for

       you. Don't you understand that ? People you hated, I hated.

She stands up.

       HEDRA

       People like you don't care.

She knocks a large metal vase down on the floor.

       HEDRA

       Just like that stupid girl in Tampa. She called my parents,

       too. Told them all my secrets.

She comes behind Allison and pulls her hair to tilt her head back.

       HEDRA

       You want to put me away, huh ?

She releases Allison's hair.

       HEDRA

       I can't... I can't keep making excuses for you, Allie. I

       can't... I can't... I can't... I can't... I can't...

She walks out of the room. She is crying.

       HEDRA

       Oh God !... Oh God !... Ohhh !

We hear her crying in the next room. Allison turns her head

slightly towards her.

Close up on Allison's face. We hear Hedra screaming and breaking

things. Allison seems terrified.

Hedra comes back into the room. She has a big knife with a

serrated blade in her hand.

Close up on Allison's face. She seems more and more terrified. She

starts moaning under her tape gag.

Hedra is now just behind Allison. She puts the tip of the blade on

Allison's throat, then the full length of the blade.

       HEDRA

       What ?... What ?

She tears the tape off Allison's mouth.

       ALLISON

       Please...

       HEDRA

       No.

Hedra's face is now very close to Allison's one. Allison raises

her head and kisses Hedra on the mouth.

Close up on the serrated blade of the knife on Allison's throat.

The blade is ready to tear the skin, but doesn't move further.

Slowly, Allison moves her mouth away from Hedra's one.

       ALLISON (whispering)

       Don't make me leave you, Ellen.

Hedra slowly raises up. She has a strange look on her face. She

seems not to understand the situation anymore.

Close-up on Allison's head and throat. We can see the slightly

bloody marks left by the serrated blade. Allison looks at Hedra

moving away from her with an anxious face.

Hedra kneels down in front of Allison. She bends down to rest her

face on Allison's lap, and starts crying. Allison moves her hand

as far as she can and strokes Hedra's hair.

       ALLISON

       Shhh !... It's okay. It's okay.

Close-up on a wallet on the floor, close to Allison's foot.

Allison is trying to reach it with her foot, but she can't because

of her leg still being taped on the armchair.

       ALLISON (voice over)

       We've got to get out of here now.

She eventually succeeds in kicking the wallet away from the

armchair. And she keeps on stroking Hedra's hair, still crying on

her lap.

NEW YORK - EXTERIOR EVENING

Large overview of the city. There is still daylight, but we can

tell, by the color of the sky, that we are getting closer to the

night.

FONTANA FASHION OFFICE - MAIN HALL - INTERIOR EVENING

In the forefront, Mitchell's assistant, Barbara, is typing on the

keyboard of a computer. Behind her, we see rows of dresses on

hangers.

Suddenly, the woman stares at the screen. We hear strange clicking

and beeping noises coming from the computer.

       BARBARA

       Jesus...

She stands up, with horror in her face, and yells.

       BARBARA

       Mitch !

FONTANA FASHION OFFICE - MITCHELL'S OFFICE - INTERIOR EVENING

The room is much smaller, and quite dark. A blonde woman is

sitting on an armchair in front of a desk. Mitchell is standing

behind her. Mitchell is slightly rocking the armchair and the

blonde woman's eyes are closed.

       MITCHELL

       What ?

He doesn't stop rocking the armchair.

       BARBARA (voice over from the main hall)

       Get in here.

       MITCHELL

       What ?

He reluctantly leaves the armchair and walks out of the room.

FONTANA FASHION OFFICE - MAIN HALL - INTERIOR EVENING

Mitchell crosses the hall

       MITCHELL

       What is it ? What?

The computer is still making strange beeping noises. On the

screen, pictures of dresses appear and then disappear immediately.

       BARBARA

       Look.

Close up on the screen. A data chart titled Fontana Fashions has

appeared. The extreme left column is labelled Expenses, and

underneath, a list of all the expenses (Lease - Telephone -

Payroll - Liabilities... and son on). The other columns on the

right are labelled Jan to Apr, and underneath lists of numbers

corresponding to the various monthly expenses.

But, the data chart has hardly appeared on the screen that the

columns of numbers start erasing themselves one by one, starting

with January.

       BARBARA

       It's erasing.

Then, when all the numbers have been erased, a window appears on

the screen with LOST! written in red letters in it.

Another data chart appears on the screen : the expenses from May

to August. And, on this chart, the columns of numbers also start

to erase themselves.

Mitchell looks severely at Barbara. She raises her hands.

       BARBARA

       I didn't do anything.

Suddenly, Mitchell seems to remember something.

       MITCHELL

       Shit !

He runs away toward his office.

The blonde woman is standing in the doorway of the office.

Mitchell brutally pushes her away.

FONTANA FASHION OFFICE - MITCHELL'S OFFICE - INTERIOR EVENING

Mitchell types something on the keyboard of his computer. We hear

the computer beeping.

Close-up on the computer screen. A data chart titled Production

line, and underneath Fontana Fashions Production Line.

Underneath, four columns of numbers labelled Order, Sam,

Scheduled and Completed. All the numbers in these columns are

erasing themselves. And then appears the window with LOST! in

red letters.

       MITCHELL (voice over)

       On mine, too !

Then another rectangular window appears on the screen. On the left

of the window, the drawing of a bomb with a lighted wick sticking

out of it. On the rest of the window, the following text :

       The last payment in Fulfillment of the Contract between

       Fontana Fashions and Allison Jones is now past due.

       Please contact Allison Jones at 212-555-9814 within 24

       Hours of the rest of your data will be irretrievably lost.

Mitchell bends down to have a better look at the screen.

Close up on the screen, while Mitchell reads out loud :

       MITCHELL (voice over)

       The last payment in Fulfillment of the Contract between

       Fontana Fashions and Allison Jones is past due. Please

       contact Allison Jones...

Medium shot of Mitchell reading what's written on the screen.

       MITCHELL

       ...in 24 hours of the rest of your data will be

       irretrievably lost. This payment policing program is

       installed on all of Allison Jones software."

Mitchell jumps up.

       MITCHELL

       Bitch !

GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - WORKING ROOM - INTERIOR EVENING

Allison is seated behind Graham's desk. She unplugs the cord from

the telephone set and plugs it in the back of a small portable

computer.

Shot on floor level. We see the bottom of the desk chair and

Allison's legs, around which there is still some duct tape. Hedra

is kneeling on the floor near the desk. She has a telephone cord

in her hand.

       HEDRA (voice over)

       Should I just plug this in the phone jack ?

       ALLISON (voice over)

       Huh-huh.

Hedra gets up and looks at what Allison is doing with the

computer.

       ALLISON

       Great.

       HEDRA

       Can you make reservations on this ?

       ALLISON

       Hm-m. And you can pay by credit card.

Close up on Hedra's face who looks intensely at Allison, not

believing completely that Allison is not trying to fool her.

       ALLISON

       L.A., right ?

       HEDRA

       Yeah.

She walks away.

FONTANA FASHION OFFICE - MAIN HALL - INTERIOR EVENING

Close up on Allison Jones' business card. Above her name, a logo

that reads Concept Software. Under Allison's name, the title

Software Designer, and underneath 768 West 74th Street, Suite

1103, New York, and underneath (212) 555-9814. On the top of

the card, written with a pencil 555-8796 KNOX.

       BARBARA (voice over)

       No answer at the first number.

Mitchell's forefinger points at the penciled number on the card.

       MITCHELL (voice over)

       What about this number ?

Mitchell is standing near Barbara's desk. She has the telephone

receiver to her ear, trying to reach someone to help them.

Mitchell brings the next desk telephone to him by pulling it by

its cord. He start dialing on the telephone.

We hear the engaged tone.

       MITCHELL

       Busy.

He throws the receiver on the desk. He starts walking away, then

turns to Barbara.

       MITCHELL

       You turn them off.

       (yelling)

       Turn them all off !

Barbara remains calm, with the telephone receiver still at her

ear.

Mitchell runs out of the room, and Barbara puts the telephone

down.

GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - WORKING ROOM - INTERIOR EVENING

Close up on the computer screen. The window is titled

Compuserve. Underneath it reads Flight Reservation. And

underneath Browse Flights by Fares. Underneath : Departure

City:. Next to it a box, where we see the letters JFK being

typed. Underneath Destination City:. Next to it, another box,

where we see the letters LAX being typed. Another window

appears, titled Flight Information, and giving all the details

of the different flights between New-York and Los Angeles.

Allison is sitting at the desk typing on the computer, and Hedra

is standing next to her.

       HEDRA

       Things are going to be different in L.A, Allie. You'll see.

       ALLISON

       First class ?

       HEDRA

       Is it worth it ?

       ALLISON

       Well, we can use one of Graham's cards. I think I saw his

       wallet in the living room.

       HEDRA

       Oh... Me too. Okay, I'll go and see.

She gets out of the room.

Close up on the computer screen. It switches from Flight

Information to Main Menu, and then to Chat-Mail Menu.

Close up on Allison's face focused on her typing on the computer.

Close up on the computer screen. It reads CB Simulator, and

underneath Chat Mode Initiated, and underneath User: Don193.

Underneath, we see the following words being typed :

       PLEASE HELP ME. THIS IS NOT A JOKE.

       HEDRA (voice over from the living room)

       I can't find it.

Allison is typing very fast. She knows she doesn't have much time.

       ALLISON

       I know I saw it somewhere. Maybe it's in the kitchen.

Close up on the computer screen. The following words have been

added :

       I'M AT 768 W.74TH STREET, APT.

Back on Allison sitting at the desk and typing. Slowly and

silently, Hedra enters the room.

Close up on Hedra's angry face. She bends down

Allison at the desk seen from behind. Suddenly we hear the noise

of a plug being pulled off from its socket. The computer screen

becomes all black and Allison turns quickly around. Hedra is

pointing her gun at her.

       ALLISON

       No ! No ! No ! No !

ALLISON'S BUILDING - MAIN LOBBY - INTERIOR EVENING

Close up shot on the window above the elevator door. We see the

elevator coming down. The camera follows the elevator down to

floor level. Mitchell is waiting in front of the elevator door.

The elevator outer door opens. Hedra is inside. She keeps the

inner door shut.

       HEDRA

       Going down.

The outer door closes in front of a bewildered Mitchell.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - BASEMENT - INTERIOR EVENING

Hedra opens the door of Allison's private cage, and enters the

cage. She tries to open a suitcase, but doesn't succeed. She slaps

nervously the suitcase. She then finds another suitcase, which is

open. She tries to fit herself inside the suitcase, and more or

less succeeds. She seems very nervous. She gets out of the

suitcase, closes it and carries it out of the cage.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - ELEVATOR CABIN - INTERIOR EVENING

Close up on the numbers above the door. They go from 9 to 10,

and then to 11.

Hedra is watching the numbers. The elevator stops.

The outer door opens. Mitchell is there, waiting for the elevator.

He opens the inner door and comes in the cabin. The outer door

closes automatically and the elevator cabin starts moving up again

He looks at the control panel, where the 12th floor is lighted.

Then he looks at Hedra, who looks back at him with a rather

unwelcoming face.

The elevator stops and Mitchell goes out first.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE GRAHAM'S APARTMENT -

INTERIOR NIGHT

Through the windows, we can see that night has come.

Mitchell goes out of the elevator, followed by Hedra pulling her

suitcase behind her.

Hedra goes directly to Graham's apartment. Mitchell first goes in

the opposite direction, and then comes back towards Hedra.

       MITCHELL

       Oh... Excuse me, miss, is this 1203 ? Is Graham Knox at

       home ?

Hedra is now in front of Graham's door and puts the key in the

keyhole. Mitchell has caught up with her, and is standing behind

her.

       HEDRA

       No, he's on a cruise.

       MITCHELL

       Actually, I'm looking for a woman Allison Jones ? Do you

       know her ?

Hedra suddenly stops unlocking the door.

       HEDRA

       Who are you ?

       MITCHELL

       Mitchell Myerson.

Hedra turns around to face Mitchell.

       MITCHELL

       She did a job for me.

       HEDRA

       Oh... There's no one named Jones on this floor.

       MITCHELL

       Yeah, I know that. I was just down at her apartment. But I

       did contact her here once.

       HEDRA

       Well, I'm the only one here and I never met her. So...

       You'll excuse me.

She bends down to pick up the suitcase.

       MITCHELL

       Oh, sorry.

Mitchell bends down to help her. He picks up the suitcase and

looks at it.

       MITCHELL

       This is hers. You do know her.

We hear a muffled scream coming from inside the apartment.

Hedra opens the door to get inside as fast as possible, but

Mitchell catches her and throws her aside. More muffled screams

coming from the apartment. Mitchell rushes into the apartment, and

closes the door shut behind him. Hedra rushes to the door, but too

late.

GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Mitchell rushes into the room, stops and looks down.

Allison is lying on the carpet, completely tied up in duct tape,

looking like a human salami. She is gagged by another piece of

tape. When she sees Mitchell, she starts wriggling and screaming

through her gag.

        MITCHELL (voice over)

        What the fuck is going on here ?

He kneels down and tears the tape off her mouth.

        ALLISON

        Be careful, she's crazy.

Hedra enters the room, pointing her gun towards Mitchell.

        HEDRA

        Get off of her.

Mitchell, still kneeling down across Allison's body, turns around.

        MITCHELL

        What ?

Hedra walks towards him, still pointing her gun with both hands in

front of her.

        HEDRA

        You think she wants you touching her, huh ? I said get off

        her !

        MITCHELL

        Okay, okay... I'm... I'm getting up. Okay.

He gets up very slowly with his hands raised at his shoulders

level. And suddenly, he grabs the gun and throws Hedra across the

room. She falls on a round table, which breaks under her weight.

She remains motionless on the floor.

Allison looks anxiously at the scene, but, from her lying position

on the carpet, doesn't see everything.

Mitchell puts the gun inside his belt and kneels down to untie

Allison.

        ALLISON

        Where is she ?

        MITCHELL

        Don't worry about her, I took care of her.

Hedra suddenly comes behind him, and strikes him very hard on the

head with a statuette. He falls down on the floor. Hedra rushes to

him and picks up the gun from his belt. She takes a cushion from

the back of an armchair, puts the cushion on Mitchell's face and

presses the barrel of the gun on the cushion. Allison screams.

GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Graham is lying in the empty bathtub, with his cat sleeping on his

right shoulder. There are a few traces of blood on the side of the

bathtub.

We hear the muffled sound of a gun shot. Then a scream from

Allison and another gunshot.

The camera moves closer to Graham's face. He has a large bloody

bump on his forehead.

There is a slight move of his head, then a slight blink of his

eyelids.

GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Close up on Hedra's hands taking some pills out of a medicine

bottle.

       HEDRA

       I don't want to try to be loved any more. And you know...

The camera moves up to Hedra's face.

       HEDRA

       I don't want to be scared any more. Or to kill any more. I

       don't want to kill any more. I don't want to be alone any

       more. I don't want to be anything any more. I don't need a

       reason to kill myself, I need a reason not to and there

       isn't one.

Hedra turns her head towards Allison sitting at the desk in front

of the computer. The camera moves away to a larger shot, and we

see that the gun is stuck in the hollow of Hedra's left elbow.

       HEDRA

       You don't want to say anything special to anyone ?

Allison shakes her head no.

       HEDRA

       Okay, Allison Jones, go on.

Close up on the computer screen. We see the words Hedra just

dictated : I don't want to try to be loved... and so on up to

...there isn't one. The words Allison Jones are being typed.

Back to Hedra pointing her gun to Allison. She takes Allison's

hand and presses it on the screen of the computer.

       HEDRA

       Now they'll know it was you.

       ALLISON

       No one who knows me will believe that I wrote that. I was

       never that scared. Well... not like that.

       HEDRA

       Of course it's you. I never met anyone so scared of being

       alone. And I saved you from that, but you don't care.

She brings a glass of water to Allison, who takes it.

       HEDRA

       Did you know that identical twins are never really

       identical ? There's always one that's prettier. And the one

       who's not does all the work. She used me and then she left

       me. Just like you.

She puts the barrel of the gun on Allison's temple, and she opens

her left hand in front of Allison's face.

       HEDRA

       Come on... take them. Come on, Allie, it's nicer this way.

       ALLISON

       Okay.

Close up on Hedra's hand full of blue pills. She pours them into

Allison's left hand. Allison's other hand still holds the glass of

water.

Without warning, Allison suddenly smashes the glass on Hedra's

face.

Then the two girls start fighting for the gun. Allison slams

Hedra's hand on a mirror hanging on the wall. The glass of the

mirror breaks into small pieces, but Hedra doesn't drop the gun.

The two girls keep on fighting on the floor, knocking various

object around them.

Close up of Allison's hand holding Hedra's hand with the gun, and

smashing it through the window. The pane breaks into small pieces,

and Hedra drops the gun on the balcony.

Hedra moves away from Allison.

Close up of Allison's hand picking up a piece of glass lying near

the gun on the balcony.

Allison slashes Hedra's chest with the broken piece of glass.

Hedra falls on the floor and Allison rushes out of the room.

Hedra gets up and picks up the gun from the balcony.

GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Allison is fumbling with the locks and the safety bar of the front

door.

Hedra rushes into the corridor, pointing her gun at Allison.

       HEDRA

       Allie !

Allison has opened the door and turns around to face Hedra.

Hedra walks slowly along the corridor towards Allison.

       HEDRA

       Please...

Allison still has the piece of broken glass in her hand.

Behind Hedra, we see Graham moving in the bathroom.

       HEDRA

       Please...

Reverse angle shot to Allison standing in the open doorway and

holding the piece of broken glass.

       ALLISON

       I'm not like your sister, Hedy. Not any more. I'm like you

       now.

Close up on the barrel of the gun.

Graham rushes out of the bathroom, grabs Hedra by the waist and

falls with her on the floor.

       ALLISON (voice over)

       Graham !

Graham bangs Hedra's head repeatedly on the floor. Hedra succeeds

in moving slightly away from him, and try to point her gun toward

him.

       HEDRA

       I'll kill you !

Allison rushes towards them, grabs Hedra by her feet, and pulls

her towards the front door. Hedra, still lying on her stomach

while being pulled away by Allison, still tries desperately to

point her gun towards Graham.

       ALLISON

       Get off him !

Allison succeeds in pulling Hedra out of the apartment. Hedra

grabs the front door with both hands to try to resist Allison's

pull.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE GRAHAM'S APARTMENT -

INTERIOR NIGHT

Allison pulls a little harder, and Hedra's hands are squeezed by

the door. She screams. Allison lets go of Hedra's legs to close

the door shut.

       ALLISON

       Graham, stay inside !

       GRAHAM (voice over from inside the apartment)

       All right.

Allison runs away towards the elevator. Hedra, still lying on the

floor, raises her gun towards Allison and shoots.

Allison screams : she's been shot in the left shoulder. Hedra

shoots again, but Allison hides behind the corner of the wall of

the hall.

Hedra gets up to run after Allison.

Close up on the elevator. Allison is already inside the cabin and

closes the inner door just as Hedra reaches the elevator.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - ELEVATOR CABIN - INTERIOR DAY

       HEDRA

       No... No... No...

Allison pulls Hedra right arm through the vertical bars of the

inner door, and opens it again, squeezing Hedra's arm very hard.

Hedra screams and drops her gun on the cabin floor. Allison closes

the inner door shut.

Close up of Allison's hand picking the gun up from the floor.

       HEDRA

       No... No... No...

Hedra watches the outer door closing slowly.

Allison points the gun towards Hedra and presses the trigger

several times. But nothing happens : there are no more cartridge

in the chamber of the gun.

Hedra opens the inner door to get into the elevator. Allison tries

to prevent her from getting in, but Hedra eventually succeeds in

getting into the cabin. She closes the inner door, and the outer

door closes itself automatically.

Hedra throws Allison against the wall of the cabin. Then she bangs

her head very hard against the wall. Allison pulls Hedra away from

her. Hedra hits the wall on the other side of the cabin, and falls

on the floor. Allison rushes and falls on Hedra, but Hedra pushes

her away from her.

The two girls start fighting in the cabin. They fall on the floor,

Hedra on top of Allison. Hedra tries to strangle Allison.

Close up of Allison's face choking under the pressure of Hedra's

hands.

Short reverse angle close up shot of Hedra's face, then back to

Allison's face.

Close up on the screwdriver hanging from its chain and rocking

gently with the movement of the elevator. Allison's hand tries to

catch it and doesn't succeed.

Back on Allison's face, suffocating more and more under Hedra's

strangulation. Back, for a couple of seconds, to Allison's hand

trying to catch the screwdriver, and then back to her suffocating

face.

Close up on Allison's hand which has eventually caught the

screwdriver, then back to her face. The face slowly relaxes as

Allison falls into unconsciousness. Her arm, which was extended to

catch the screwdriver, falls on the floor of the cabin.

Hedra watches Allison's face intently. Then, when she realizes

that Allison is unconscious, she bends down and kisses her on the

cheek. She brings Allison's both arms along Allison's sides, then

she puts her head on her chest and kisses her hand.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - BASEMENT - INTERIOR DAY

The outer door of the elevator opens, and, through the vertical

bars of the inner door, we can see Allison still lying on her back

on the floor of the cabin. Hedra opens the inner door, then pulls

Allison by the legs out of the elevator.

        HEDRA (snorting under the effort of pulling Allison)

        Huh... Huh...

She pulls Allison along the corridor of the basement.

She reaches the door opening on the emergency staircase, and kicks

it shut.

She suddenly stops and looks intently at Allison lying on the

floor. She grabs a green blanket on a shelf and wraps Allison's

face in it.

She pushes a a heavy metallic storage shelves cabinet along the

wall all the way to the emergency staircase door, in order to

prevent it from being opened by anyone coming from the staircase.

Then she pulls down a big lever on the wall on the side of the

cage where the elevator machinery is enclosed. We supposed it is

the emergency switch of the elevator, and that she also wants to

prevent anyone coming down to the basement from using the

elevator.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - INCINERATOR ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Hedra picks up some pieces of dry wood from a wheelbarrow and puts

them inside the incinerator, where some flames are still burning.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - BASEMENT - INTERIOR DAY

Hedra pushes the empty wheelbarrow along the corridor of the

basement.

Suddenly she stops, drops the wheelbarrow and emits a short

scream.

Reverse angle shot on the green blanket on the floor. Allison is

gone.

Hedra looks very worried.

        HEDRA

       Allie ?

She runs to the blanket, but doesn't stop and keeps on running to

the elevator. She gives a quick look inside the open cabin, then

tries to open a large locked gate, near the elevator, but doesn't

succeed.

       HEDRA (yelling)

       Allie ?

She goes back along the corridor the way she came from. Near the

place where she left the wheelbarrow, she comes to a door marked

Storage, and opens it

       HEDRA

       Hey, here you are.

But this is just a closet full of various junk.

Hedra thinks she heard something and quickly turns around. She

takes a big iron hook from the storage closet and starts walking

menacingly along the corridor.

       HEDRA

       Don't make me come get you... Allie, come out now... Come

       on... Allie !...

She bangs the hook on a vertical pipe on the wall.

Close up on a rat scuttling away from the noise.

Close up on Allie hidden in a big metal box, near the ceiling of

the basement. This metal box is obviously a part of the

ventilation system.

       HEDRA (voice over)

       Come on !

The rat is running along a large horizontal pipe towards Allison,

who seems frightened by it.

High angle shot of Hedra seen from Allison's hiding place.

       HEDRA (screaming)

       Come out now !

Close up on Allison's face, frightened by the rat.

Reverse angle close up shot of the rat coming towards us and

Allison.

Back to Allison looking at the rat.

       HEDRA (voice over)

       Allie, please.

High angle shot of Hedra. She is crying.

       HEDRA

       I'm scared ! Where are you ?

The rat has reached Allison's hiding place. She pushes it down

from the pipe where it was standing.

The rat falls on Hedra's shoulder. She screams.

Allison hides back into the ventilation metal box not to be seen

by Hedra.

Hedra throws the rat on the floor.

The rat runs away.

Hedra looks up at the place where the rat fell from.

Close up at Allison's hiding place. The metal box seems empty.

       HEDRA (voice over)

       Allie...

ALLISON'S BUILDING - INCINERATOR ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Hedra comes back into the incinerator room. Just above the open

door of the incinerator, there is a big ventilation metal box,

similar to the one Allison is hiding in.

Hedra bangs the box with her hook. She must think that Allison is

crawling inside the ventilation system.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - BASEMENT - INTERIOR DAY

Allison is peeking from behind a corner of the corridor.

Reverse angle shot showing what Allison sees. We - and she - see

the incinerator room with Hedra banging her hook on the

ventilation system.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - INCINERATOR ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Hedra is walking backward, away from the incinerator. She hears a

strange noise and turns around.

ALLISON'S BUILDING - BASEMENT - INTERIOR DAY

We see the open door of a cage slightly moving with a squeaking

noise.

Hedra walks toward the cage.

       HEDRA

       Why are you hiding from me ?

Close up on a big wooden closet with two doors. A piece of green

fabric is sticking out between the two closed doors.

Hedra bangs her hook on the closet.

       HEDRA

       You think I can't find you ? Huh ? Your goddam shirt is

       sticking out of it.

She opens the door, sees herself in a mirror at the back of the

closet, and thinking it's Allison, bangs her hook on the mirror

and breaks it.

Hedra backs up one step from the closet. And suddenly, Allison,

who was hiding in the pipework on the ceiling, falls down upside

down, hanging from her legs hooked in the pipework. She stabs

Hedra in the back with the elevator screwdriver. Hedra screams,

and tries to take the screwdriver off her back.

Allison drops on the floor. Hedra tries to hit her with the hook,

but Allison grabs her arm.

With her other free hand, Allison pulls the screwdriver out of

Hedra's back, then immediately sticks it again in another place on

Hedra's back.

       HEDRA

       Allie...

Hedra slowly falls on the floor, where she remains motionless.

Allison looks down at her, trying to catch her breath back.

She kneels down to close Hedra's eyelids.

BLACK SCREEN

       ALLISON (voice over)

       I cried the whole week of Sam's funeral.

ALLISON'S NEW APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

This is Allison's new place. Actually it is the apartment Allison

visited with Sam, just before the puppy's death.

Some furniture from the old apartment, and a lot of unopened boxes

on the floor. It looks like if Allison just moved in.

Very large windows overlooking New-York. Allison is standing near

one of the windows, with her back toward us.

       ALLISON (voice over)

       Graham says that won't bring him back. He says I have to

       start letting go. He's right.

Close up on Hedra's collection of photographs, lying near the

shoebox where she used to stock them. In the forefront, the black

and white picture of Hedra and her twin sister holding a dog

between them.

       ALLISON (voice over)

       Hedy's parents said that for years they'd tried to explain

       her that her sister's death wasn't her fault.

We see Allison's hands taking the pictures one by one.

       ALLISON (voice over)

          But she never forgave herself for surviving.

The last picture she takes is the black and white picture of the

twins with the dog. She puts all the pictures back in the shoebox,

with the twins and dog picture on the top.

          ALLISON (voice over)

          So every day, I try to forgive Hedy for Sam.

Allison puts the lid back on the shoebox.

          ALLISON (voice over)

          Then I try to do what she couldn't... Forgive myself.

The camera moves slowly away from the shoebox to a last photograph

hidden underneath some wrapping plastic material.

          ALLISON (voice over)

          I know what can happen to someone who doesn't.

Close up on the picture. It looks like the picture of the face of

one woman. But actually, the picture is a mixture of two pictures.

The left half-side of the picture shows Allison's face, when the

right half-side shows Hedra's face.

CREDITS
