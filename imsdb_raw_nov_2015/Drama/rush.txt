1   EXT. CLOUDY SKY - GERMANY - DAY                                   1

    Dark clouds passing overhead.

    The bad weather that has hovered over the Eifel mountains, (in

    Germany), the past three days is on it's way out..

2   AN EYE FLICKERS - WIDE OPEN - STARING INTENTLY                    2

    A pupil dilates and contracts in the light. The eye stares.

    Blinks. Thinks. Making evaluations..

3   EXT. CLOUDY SKY - GERMANY - DAY                                   3

    The first rays of sunshine break through. The voices of

    international TV commentators in different languages.

                         COMMENTATORS

               ...in places the track is still

               dangerously wet, but following a

               drivers meeting the decision has been

               taken. The race is going ahead...

4   INT. FERRARI - DAY                                                4

    The eye belongs to a 27 year old Formula 1 RACING DRIVER

    wearing a fireproof balaclava...

    Highly intelligent, he also happens to be World Champion. His

    name is painted on the side of his Ferrari. NIKI LAUDA.

                         NIKI (V/O)

               My grandfather always said history is

               cruel and reductive and no matter how

               long we live, or how much we achieve -

               we are remembered for very little. So

               make sure it's the right things.

    NIKI stares up at the clouds. His eyelids flicker. Thinking.

    Agonizing. Wrestling with an all important decision...

    Is it going to carry on raining? Or become dry? Should he be

    using slicks or wets?

5   EXT. STARTING GRID - DAY                                          5

    We widen to find ourselves on the starting grid of a major

    Grand Prix. All around us...

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                         2

    Engines scream into life as DRIVERS start their cars. An

    OFFICIAL walks through the cars holding aloft a sign, "One

    Minute"...

    Deafening, angry thunder as engines rev impatiently.

                           NIKI

                 This is bullshit. We have no control

                 over our legacy. We cannot choose what

                 we are remembered for...

    A Ferrari MECHANIC rushes towards NIKI, and shouts in Italian

    above the noise, (we see sub-titles)...

                           MECHANIC

                 Mass usa slicks. Le vuoi cambiare

                 anche tu?

                     (Mass is going on slicks. You

                      want to change?)

    NIKI looks in his wing-mirror back to see a red McLaren, white

    helmet, number 12, several rows behind him. A team of

    MECHANICS hastily changing the tyres to dry tyres.

                           NIKI

                 Otherwise I wouldn't be remembered for

                 my rivalry with this asshole. And the

                 1976 season.

    NIKI then looks over at the car in pole position beside him.

    Another McLaren, but with number 11, and a Union Jack...

                           NIKI

                 What about Hunt? Has he changed?

                           MECHANIC

                 No, he's going on wets.

    The car in pole position: JAMES HUNT, surrounded by TV crews,

    mechanics, girlfriends, hangers-on..

    The Maclaren team is less than half the size of Ferrari's, but

    HUNT makes up for this with magnetism. The rock star of F1.

    NIKI's face: a stab of envy seeing a flash of his rival's

    glamorous long blonde hair disappearing into his balaclava,

    flirting with several hot-looking GIRLS..

                           NIKI

                 I don't know why it became such a big

                 thing. We were just drivers. Busting

                 each other's balls. To me this is

                 perfectly normal. But other people saw

                 it differently.

5   CONTINUED: (2)                                                   5

                         NIKI (contid)

               That whatever it was between us went

               deeper. And changed us both somehow.

               Forever.

    NIKI stares, then...

                         NIKI

               Be, allora usiamo anche noi quells da

               bagnato.

                   (Then we go on wets, too.)

    The ten-second board is held up.

    NIKI pulls down his visor...as he and HUNT's eyes meet for a

    split-second, eyes staring...

    NIKI selects second gear for the wet track and revs the

    engine. The dashboard needle climbs through 8000, 9000, 10000

    RPM.

                         NIKI

               Maybe that explains the state of mind

               I was in. And why it happened. The

               other thing I'm remembered for.

                   (a beat)

               On August 1st, that same year...

    CAPTION: "AUGUST 1st, 1976".

    The STARTER waves the flag. NIKI's foot hits the floor - his

    engine screams that deafening, stomach rearranging high-pitch

    scream, drowning out the roar of the 180,000 crowd.

    NIKI's car is catapaulted forward violently, the wheel-spin

    leaving livid black scars on the asphalt..

    NIKI gets away first. A good start! But within seconds there's

    a McLaren car right behind him, breathing down his neck.

    His arch-rival. HUNT.

    But as the McLaren roars past, NIKI sees a white helmet.

    Number 12. It's not Hunt. It's MASS. On his bald, slick tyres.

    NIKI curses under his breath. He screwed up. Made the wrong

    decision. Should have gone on slicks. He urgently needs to

    change tyres...

    NIKI swerves angrily into the pits. Ferrari's pit is right at

    one end...

                                                                          4

6   INT. PITS - DAY                                                   6

    Commentary from all the world's TV stations explaining the

    crazy, panicked situation as all the DRIVERS come into the

    pits to change to dry tyres.

    It's chaos. A traffic jam of Formula 1 cars...

    The Ferrari team frantically work. Changing NIKI's tyres. Four

    men with air guns, two men with rapid-duty jacks. The same

    Italian MECHANIC appears, `plugs in' his headset to the car..

                         MECHANIC

               Hair visto? Ti aveto detto di usare le

               slicks!

                   (See? I told you to go on

                    slicks!!)

                         NIKI

               Bullshit. Where's Hunt?

                            MECHANIC

               There!

    NIKI looks up to see the name JAMES HUNT written on the black

    helmet roar out of the pits ahead, with new tyres on...

                            NIKI

               C'mon...!!

    NIKI screams at the MECHANICS, who are struggling. The airguns

    make a high-pitched noise...something's not right.

                         NIKI

               What's GOING ON???

    "Thump", new (slick) tyres hit the tarmac, engines scream, and

    NIKI exit the pits in pursuit of HUNT. But the delay has cost

    him dear...

7   EXT. NUBURGRING - DAY                                             7

    Archive TV commentary from the world's race COMMENTATORS

    stations informs us of the positions.

    MASS leading, HUNT in 3rd, LAUDA in 20th...

8   INT. NIKI'S CAR - DAY                                             8

    NIKI gives it everything he's got. Tearing through the gears,

    trying to catch JAMES HUNT, breaking as late as he can, engine

    screaming.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

    He flies over the take-off hump between Pflanzgarten and

    Swallowtail - passes one car after another. Into 13th place

    now. Pulling off outrageous manoeuvres.

    NIKI's P.O.V: the world flies past in a blur. The steering

    wheel shakes. The car is right on the edge. Cannot be driven

    any harder.

    NIKI approaches the Streckenteil Adenauer-Brucke section of

    the course...turns left at the Bergwerk corner. Crazy speed.

    And tight. Too tight. A mistake...

    "Thump", his wheels come into contact with the kerb on the

    inside. NIKI tries to counter-steer, but is travelling at 155

    mph. The car jerks horribly to the right..

    "Crunch", hits the embankment, then "Bang", hits the barrier,

    and is thrown across the track..

    Fire breaks out in the engine. NIKI's eyes widen in horror,

    with another car bearing down upon him...

                          NIKI

                 No...!

    The oncoming car crashes head-on into our car, "Crash", a

    sickening, terrifying impact.

    The car explodes. Seventy litres of burning high-octane

    gasoline, with NIKI strapped inside, unable to undo his

    seatbelt. Locked in a blast furnace.

    NIKI screams as the flames engulf him. 800 degrees

    temperature. Trapped inside his car.

    Burning smoke fills his helmet, scarring his lungs...

    Pandemonium: commentary in different languages as panicked TV

    commentators helplessly describe what's happening..

    NIKI's POV: he can just make out the barely recognizable

    figures of the other DRIVERS rushing towards NIKI..

    Their hands get burnt in the flames as they try unsuccessfully

    to undo NIKI's seatbelt..

    Fire extinguishers blast at the car. Dry powder extinguishers.

    Covering NIKI's helmet. Blurring his vision, as he cries out

    in agony, inhaling the powder..

    Screaming voices. Panicked reactions. On the side of the car,

    the painted name `Niki Lauda' blisters and melts.

    Then sound fades. As NIKI blacks out - losing consciousness.

                                                     FADE TO BLACK:

    Over this: the sound of a ringing phone...

9   INT. HOSPITAL A&E UNIT - (ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY) - DAY           9

    We're in a busy hospital A&E unit. Noise. Crowds. A regular

    Saturday late afternoon. The phone continues to ring..

    Finally, an attractive station NURSE in her 20's, run-off-her-

    feet, breathlessly picks up the phone.

                         NURSE

               Emergency...

    She covers her ears, straining to hear, listening to what is

    being said. Then her expression changes...

                         NURSE

               Okay...standing by!

    The NURSE hangs up...then calls out to her NURSE and DOCTOR

    colleagues...

                         NURSE

               That was the race-track..! There's

               been an accident..! A driver's been

               injured and is on his way in..!

    Instantly the atmosphere changes. A hive of activity as

    DOCTORS and NURSES prepare themselves for a major trauma...

    All PATIENTS with minor injuries are cleared out of the way.

    The NURSE rings upstairs to the operating theatres and

    consultant surgeons, telling them to stand by...

    CAPTION: "EIGHTY-EIGHT RACES EARLIER"

    Swing doors open, and a pair of shoeless, BARE FEET walks

    through and into the accident and emergency unit.

    Camera tilts up a pair of long legs in white racing

    overalls...to reveal a tall, good-looking driver, JAMES HUNT,

    (mid 20's), tanned, athletic, surfer long blonde hair...

    A man about whom a word comes to mind one would rarely use to

    describe an Englishman. SEXY.

    Blood trickles from his nose, there is bruising to his lip and

    the formation (already) of a nasty black eye, but make no

    mistake. He rocks. Drop-dead gorgeous..

                            JAMES

                  I think the racetrack telephoned ahead

                  that I was coming? Hunt? James Hunt..?

     JAMES notices all the NURSES staring..

                            JAMES

                  What's the matter? No one seen a spot

                  of blood before?

                            NURSE

                  Are you all right?

                            JAMES

                  Absolutely fine.

10   INT. A&E UNIT - DAY                                              10

     The attractive NURSE is examining JAMES, opening his overalls,

     checking for wounds, cuts and bruises...

                            NURSE

                  We all thought you'd been in an

                  accident.

                            JAMES

                  I have. If you call a friendly

                  disagreement with another driver an

                  accident.

                            NURSE

                  What did you disagree about?

                            JAMES

                  None of your business. Ouch.

                              NURSE

                  Sorry.

                              JAMES

                  His wife.

                            NURSE

                  That's going to need a couple of

                  stitches. It's a nasty cut.

                            JAMES

                  It was a nasty blow. Done with a

                  bloody spanner.

                            NURSE

                  Why? What did you do?

                  Nothing! Only what she begged me to

                  do.

     The NURSE notices bruising on JAMES's chest...

                            NURSE

                  Which was..?

     She examines him, testing his ribs for fractures, his chest..

     JAMES looks up. Their eyes meet..

                            JAMES

                  Be happy to show you if you like.

11   INT. JAMES'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                  11

     `Crash', the door flies open as JAMES and the NURSE stumble

     through, mid-embrace, tearing at one another's clothes...

     The apartment is basic. Cramped. Messy. Like that of a poor

     student. Ashtrays filled with half-smoked joints. Empty beer

     cans. A toaster. A kettle. A stereo. A cage containing two

     budgerigars.

     A mattress on the floor.

     Newspapers with headlines about the Dockers Strike, England's

     crumbling economy, Rolls Royce being bailed out by the

     government - subtle reminders of Britain in transition,

     leaving behind its strong, imperial past.

     JAMES and the NURSE stand against the wall, still half-

     dressed, but already passionately making love...

                            JAMES (V/O)

                  I have a theory why women like racing

                  drivers. It's not because they respect

                  what we do...driving round and round

                  in circles. Mostly they think that's

                  pathetic. And they're probably right..

                      (a beat)

                  It's our closeness to death.

     JAMES and the NURSE continue noisily, tirelessly making love

     in the shower...

                            JAMES (V/O)

                  The closer you are to death, the more

                  alive you FEEL...the more alive you

                  ARE. And they can see that in you.

                            JAMES (V/O) (contid)

                  With no thought for tomorrow...as if

                  each day is your last. It's a

                  wonderful way to live...and the ONLY

                  way to drive. The only way to get that

                  tenth of a second on everyone else...

     The lovemaking becomes more intense...

                            JAMES (V/O)

                  To dare to be one step bolder...one

                  step faster...

     JAMES is covered in perspiration, out on the edge...

                            JAMES (V/O)

                  Sure one step closer to death...

     JAMES and the NURSE, both screaming as they approach orgasm...

                            JAMES (V/O)

                  But one step closer to victory, too...

     JAMES and the NURSE both climax together...and collapse on the

     bed. Exhausted.

12   EXT. CRYSTAL PALACE RACE TRACK - DAY                             12

     A grotty old race track in South London.

     JAMES and the NURSE arrive at Crystal Palace race track in his

     battered old mini. They get out. She looks up, seeing the

     mechanics, the racing teams, the cars..

                            NURSE

                  I've never been to a Grand Prix

                  before.

                            JAMES

                  You still haven't. This is Formula 3.

                            NURSE

                  What's that?

                            JAMES

                  A lower division. Where people like me

                  mess about in the hope of finding

                  sponsors or being talent-spotted to

                  race in Formula 1.

     JAMES leads the NURSE into...

                                                                           10

     The pits where JAMES introduces her to his team...

                          JAMES

                Everyone, this is Nursie.

                          NURSIE

                    (correcting)

                Gemma...

                          JAMES

                Nursie, this is Doc our designer...

                          DOC

                How do you do?

                          JAMES

                Bubbles, our chief mechanic.

                          BUBBLES

                How do you do?

                          JAMES

                Le Patron - Alexander, Lord Hesketh.

                          HESKETH

                How do you do?

                          NURSE

                Fine, thanks. Blimey...is everyone in

                Formula 3 this posh?

                          HESKETH

                Glass of champagne, Nursie?

                          NURSE

                It's Gemma. No, thanks.

                          HESKETH

                You sure? It's Krug. Clos de Mesnil.

                          NURSE

                It's also ten in the morning.

                          HESKETH

                Oh, dear. Superstar? You haven't

                brought us a bore, have you?

     JAMES strips off, changing into his racing overalls.

                          JAMES

                Trust me. Nursie's anything BUT a

                bore..

                                                            (CONTINUED)

     The NURSE, meanwhile, drifts over to look at the car where

     BUBBLES is making last minute checks...

                            NURSE

                  That's the car?

                            BUBBLES

                  That's her. The Dastle Mk 9...with the

                  Lotus twin-cam sixteen hundred engine.

                  She's no beauty. But goes like the

                  clappers.

     An odd-looking car. A bit like a giant Go-kart, blue with

     yellow strips along the side and James's name in small

     letters. It looks small, dangerously fragile.

                            JAMES

                  Uuuurrrrrkkkkkkggghghhhh.

     The NURSE is shocked to hear a dreadful watery vomiting sound.

     She sees JAMES bent over behind the truck...

                            HESKETH

                  Nothing to be worried about! Does it

                  before every race! Good sign,

                  actually. Means he's stoked!

14   EXT. PADDOCK - SAME TIME                                         14

     JAMES continues vomiting...

                            JAMES (V/O)

                  There's a lie that all drivers tell

                  themselves. "Death is something that

                  happens to other people." That's how

                  you find the courage to get in the car

                  in the first place...

     JAMES emerges, wiping his mouth...

                            HESKETH

                  All right, Superstar?

                            JAMES

                  Never better, Patron.

                            JAMES (V/O)

                  Because bad things only happen to

                  others, right?

                            HESKETH

                  Have a gargle with this.

                                                           (CONTINUED)

14   CONTINUED:                                                     14

     JAMES takes a quick swig of the champagne...gargles, then

     swallows, puts on his balaclava...

                            JAMES (V/O)

                  Problem is deep down you know that's a

                  lie. That it could happen to you at

                  any moment.

                            HESKETH

                  Quick toke of this...

     HESKETH passes over a joint, which JAMES inhales, taking a

     huge lungful from....

                            JAMES (V/O)

                  So how do you make that terror go

                  away? Well, booze is good for that.

                  And wacky baccy. But better than

                  everything else is...sex.

     JAMES goes to the NURSE...and kisses her full on the lips,

     then puts on his helmet, and athletically vaults into the car.

     JAMES hits the ignition, and a deafening high-pitched SCREAM

     as the engine starts...

                            HESKETH

                  Ahhhh! What music! They could never

                  have predicted it, those pioneers that

                  invented the automobile that it would

                  possess us like this, in our

                  imaginations, our dreams. Nursie, men

                  love women...but even more than that,

                  men love CARS...

15   EXT. PADDOCK - CRYSTAL PALACE - DAY                              15

     JAMES notices another driver (NIKI LAUDA), his car already

     unloaded, (number 35) and mechanics working on it..

                            JAMES

                  Who's that?

                            DOC

                  He's new. Some German.

                            BUBBLES

                  Austrian.

                            JAMES

                  Is there a difference?

     JAMES looks over. On the side of the car, painted markings, in

     the form of a signature, "Niki Lauda".

                            JAMES

                  All bloody Goosesteppers.

16   EXT. RACE TRACK - CRYSTAL PALACE - DAY                           16

     JAMES is neck and neck with NIKI. They go into a corner.

     NIKI gets there first. Up ahead though, approaching the second

     bend...JAMES sees the tiniest, slimmest crack to overtake. No

     right-minded driver would risk it. Only a suicidal maniac.

     Which just happens to describe JAMES perfectly..

     JAMES goes for it. Daringly. Brilliantly. And forces NIKI to

     slam on his brakes to prevent a certain crash...

17   EXT. PITS - SAME TIME                                            17

     HESKETH, BUBBLES, DOC and the NURSE watch from the

     sidelines...

                            BUBBLES

                  That move was suicide!

                            HESKETH

                  It was also quite brilliant!! God he's

                  got balls!!

18   EXT. RACE TRACK - DAY                                            18

     JAMES carries on driving. Flat out.

     But on the flat, NIKI suddenly comes out of nowhere. As if his

     car has 50 bhp more.

     And overtakes JAMES. NIKI begins to pull away. And has the

     Englishman beaten..

     JAMES sees red mist...and in an act of do-or-die vengeful

     madness, JAMES goes into a corner far too fast...

     ...yanks his steering wheel. And outrageously shunts NIKI's

     car. An unforgivable act of unsportsmanlike vindictiveness.

     NIKI and JAMES's cars both veer off...go into wild, lethal

     spins..but luckily for JAMES he ends up facing the right

     way...

                                                           (CONTINUED)

     ...and despite being badly shaken, dizzy, JAMES is able to

     change gears, and continue driving...

     NIKI's car, by contrast, has stalled...and now ends up facing

     THE WRONG WAY on the track...

     NIKI's eyes look up to see all the cars coming over a brow,

     like a herd of Wildebeest, heading towards him...

                            NIKI

                  Umgotteswillen...

     NIKI rips open his seat-belt, is about to get out of his car,

     when one car shoots straight over the nose of his car.

     NIKI ducks, then bravely leaps for cover, as....

     "SMASH", one of the oncoming cars shunts into his car, (it

     would have killed him instantly).

     "WHAM", another car narrowly misses him...

     "CRASH", another car forces NIKI into an evasive dive...

     Cars scream past him on all sides as the race continues...

     NIKI, battered, shaken, has had an unbelievably close escape.

     He rips off his helmet, furious...

     And now we see NIKI LAUDA's face for the first time. Sharp-

     featured. Intelligent eyes. Dark hair. Protruding teeth.

     Something unmistakably rat-like about him.

19   EXT. CRYSTAL PALACE RACE TRACK - LATE AFTERNOON                 19

     JAMES is on the podium, having won. He's with the NURSE, and

     HESKETH and BUBBLES and his team, spraying them with

     champagne..

     NIKI walks past the podium, holding his blue helmet, and

     shouts out, still incandescent...

                            NIKI

                  Hey...asshole! That was my line! I had

                  that corner...

                            JAMES

                  You mean the one you spun out of? And

                  finished facing the other way? I think

                  that corner had you.

     Laughter.

                  That move was total suicide. What if I

                  hadn't braked? We'd have crashed..!!

                            JAMES

                  But we didn't, did we? Thanks to your

                  impeccable `survival' instincts...

     JAMES makes chicken noises...

                            NIKI

                  Fuck you! What's your name?

                            HESKETH

                  James Simon Wallis Hunt. Remember it,

                  my little Jerry friend. Because one

                  day he will be World Champion.

                            JAMES

                  Jawohl. Remember ze name. Very simple.

                  "Hunt". It rhymes with....

     "BEEEEP", a car horn hoots nearby, blocking out JAMES's c-word

     insult...

                             JAMES

                  ...a word that happens to describe you

                  perfectly.

     Laughter. NIKI gives JAMES the finger, "Screw you, asshole".

     The NURSE watches NIKI go..

                            NURSE

                  Who was that?

                            JAMES

                  No one. Chippy little Kraut. Bad

                  loser. Forget him.

     NIKI continues to walk off, middle finger raised..

     NIKI's voice...

                            NIKI (V/O)

                  In my home town, Vienna, my family is

                  famous for one thing. Business. My

                  grandfather was a businessman, my

                  father, too...

                                                                           16

     NIKI is in front of a mirror, and dresses smartly in a jacket,

     and open necked shirt, evidently a little nervous...

                          NIKI (V/O)

                So when they heard I wanted to race

                cars for a living, they had a few

                things to say...

22   INT. LAUDA GRANDFATHER HOUSE - NIGHT                             22

     A large, forbidding dining room. NIKI's FATHER and terrifying

     GRANDFATHER, are eating supper. GRANDFATHER shakes his head,

     clearly disapproves and barks in German...(we see subtitles)

                          GRANDFATHER

                Never! Racing is for playboys and

                dilettantes. Frivolous amateurs with

                nothing in their heads. The name

                `Lauda' appears on the front pages,

                with politicians and economists, not

                on the back pages with...

                    (gestures in contempt)

                ...footballers and skiers. If you want

                my money, you do as I say and follow

                me into my business..

     NIKI stares at his GRANDFATHER..

                          NIKI (V/O)

                It's in moments like this that you

                discover who you really are..

     ...and in a move that he knows will rupture the family for

     ever, NIKI gets to his feet..

                          NIKI

                Fine. Keep your money. Don't invest in

                me. But when I'm World Champion, and I

                have the trophy, and my name is not

                just on the back pages, but on the

                front too, you will regret it.

     NIKI walks out, the old man's insults ringing in his ears...

                          GRANDFATHER

                You dare sit at my table and lecture

                me on what I will or won't regret? Get

                out! Impertinent wretch! Consider

                yourself disowned!

                                                                          17

23   INT. RAIFEISENKASSE - BANK - DAY                                23

     NIKI is in a meeting with visibly concerned BANKERS and

     LAWYERS. They speak in German...

                          BANKER

                Another loan? Herr Lauda, you still

                haven't repaid the other...

                          BANKER

                Totalling millions of Schillings. Plus

                your Grandfather called to inform us

                he will no longer be offering

                security.

                          NIKI

                I know. There is no room for failure.

                I understand that.

                          NIKI (V/O)

                But I was still a Lauda...

24   INT. NIKI'S CAR/ ROAD TO VIENNA AIRPORT - DAY                   24

     NIKI is driving his car. Beside him, is the attache case on

     his lap. His car passes under a motorway sign reading

     "Flughafen". (Airport)...

                          NIKI (V/O)

                ...which meant I was still a

                businessman above everything else.

25   EXT. VIENNA AIRPORT - DAY                                       25

     A private jet. A balding, blazered Englishman in late middle-

     age (LOUIS STANLEY), owner of BRM racing, disembarks onto the

     tarmac...

                          NIKI (V/O)

                It just so happens that the business I

                deal in is speed.

26   INT. VIENNA AIRPORT - CAFE                                      26

     NIKI sits with LOUIS STANLEY in an airport cafe.

     Contracts are open on the table. NIKI is signing. LOUIS

     STANLEY is counter-signing...

                            STANLEY

                  In return for your money you get a

                  car, mechanics and a place on the

                  team. Plus fifty per cent of starting

                  fees and bonuses for podium finishes.

                            NIKI

                  Who's the number one driver?

                            STANLEY

                  Clay Regazzoni and you will defer to

                  him at all times.

     NIKI takes out his cheque book and pen. He looks up...

                            NIKI

                  Why would I defer to him if I am

                  paying his wages?

     NIKI writes the cheque. STANLEY's smile fades..

                            STANLEY

                  Because he's a proven winner at the

                  highest level, a good guy, and someone

                  who quite frankly, could teach you a

                  thing or two.

     NIKI ignores this, continues scrutinizing the contract...

                            NIKI

                  OK. There is one clause missing.

                            STANLEY

                  The one about mechanics' exclusivity?

                  Sorry. We have a cardinal rule at BRM.

                  All information is shared between ALL

                  our drivers..

                            NIKI

                  And I made it perfectly clear that my

                  mechanics work for me. No one else.

                  This is something I cannot sign.

     NIKI takes back the cheque. STANLEY stares...

                            STANLEY

                  All right. I'll have the lawyers amend

                  it.

                            NIKI

                  While you're at it you can tell them

                  to amend the clause for podium

                  finishes. Podium is first THREE

                  places, not just wins.

     NIKI puts the cheque in his attache case. Snaps it shut,

     taking it with him..

                          NIKI

                You'll get the money on signature, as

                agreed. See you at winter testing.

     NIKI gets to his feet, and leaves. STANLEY watches the attache

     case disappear.

                          STANLEY

                If that little git drives half as well

                as he negotiates, we're going to be

                fine.

     An awards ceremony is in progress. The room is thick with

     cigar and cigarette smoke. A presenter on stage, wearing black

     tie...

                          PRESENTER

                I'm delighted to say the winner of the

                British Guild of Motoring Writers

                award for the `Most Promising Driver

                of the Year' is James Hunt...

     A loud, boisterous cheer goes up at the Hesketh Racing table.

     JAMES turns to a (new/different) girlfriend beside him, gives

     her a lingering kiss on the lips, then gets to his feet,

     shakes hands with HESKETH, and BUBBLES and skips up to the

     podium...

                          JAMES

                Thank you. My parents always wanted me

                to be a doctor, or stockbroker, and

                gave me a first class education...but

                to no avail. My brothers are the

                success stories. I get bored easily. I

                have a hot head, an inability to

                tolerate discipline. I fall out with

                people left and right. I'm quick to

                settle matters with my fists. The only

                creatures I've ever loved and treated

                well, are budgerigars. In any normal

                area of life, I'd be...or AM...a total

                liability. All I've got going for me

                is I'm quick in a car.

                  That's not all!

     Laughter.

                            JAMES

                  So thank you for acknowledging that.

                  And giving me this...

                      (indicating trophy)

                  I'm going to give it to my Dad, and

                  tell him to put it on the mantle-piece

                  and imagine it's a first class degree

                  in medicine.

     Afterwards: everyone is celebrating. Thanks to JAMES, every

     pretty woman in the club is around. The trophy is perched

     beside bottles of champagne...

                            HESKETH

                  Well done, Superstar. One more season

                  in F2 then I'll move you up. To the

                  big time.

                            JAMES

                  You don't think I'm ready now?

                            HESKETH

                  You are! I'm not! I've got to find you

                  a car first. And the money. The

                  economics of Formula 1 are terrifying.

                            BUBBLES

                  Hurry up. You don't want him to do

                  what Lauda did.

     `Pop', HESKETH opens a bottle of champagne...

                            BUBBLES (contid)

                  The Goosestepper. Remember him?

                  Said if he was going to risk his life,

                  he would only do so on the big

                  roulette table. Formula 1. So he got

                  himself a drive with BRM.

                            JAMES

                  What? How? He never won a thing! Not a

                  single bloody race.

                            HESKETH

                  Amateurs are what made this country

                  great.

                            BUBBLES

                  Took out a loan, apparently. Paid for

     JAMES stares. Already sick with envy.

                            JAMES

     Glamorous, long-haired, tanned, fashionable - like rock stars,

     they talk effortlessly and flirt confidently with AGNES.

     What are you doing answering the phones? New haircut! Like it.

     What have you done to the weather?

     They make her laugh. And smile.

     NIKI feels invisible. Embarrassed. Awkward. Inadequate. He

     gets to his feet. And goes to the car that has come to collect

     him.

     As he goes, (unseen by NIKI), AGNES watches him. Ignoring the

     other DRIVERS. Intrigued.

     He's different. Interesting. Intense. Intelligent eyes.

31   EXT. BRM WORKSHOPS - DAY                                         31

     The car pulls up outside the workshops. NIKI gets out of the

     car, and is greeted by LOUIS STANLEY, and the BRM team...

                          STANLEY

                Niki, let me introduce you to our

                number 1 driver, Clay Regazzoni..and

                our number 2, Jean Pierre Beltoise..

     The intimidating, muscular, moustachioed figure of CLAY

     REGAZZONI, the Swiss driver. NIKI and CLAY shake hands.

                          STANLEY

                And these are your mechanics,

                reporting exclusively to you. As per

                contract...

     REGAZZONI, BELTOISE and STANLEY exchange looks as NIKI shakes

     hands, ad-libbed greetings with his MECHANICS.

                          MECHANIC

                You want to see the car?

32   INT/EXT. BRM WORKSHOPS - DAY                                     32

     NIKI is led into the workshop to see a red and white Marlboro

     sponsored car, number 21, with a tall air-intake duct just

     above the driver's helmet...

                          MECHANIC

                There she is. The P160..

                          NIKI

                Same as Regazzoni's?

                                                         (CONTINUED)

32   CONTINUED:                                                     32

                            MECHANIC

                  Identical in every detail.

     NIKI scrutinizes the car...

                            NIKI

                  She looks heavy. How much does she

                  weigh?

                               MECHANIC

                  540 kilos.

                            NIKI

                  That's crazy. Why so heavy..?

                            MECHANIC

                  It's a 3 litre, V12 engine, that thing

                  weighs 190k alone.

                            NIKI

                  What horsepower are you getting out of

                  it?

                               MECHANIC

                  450.

                            NIKI

                  Not enough. Needs to be 500 and the

                  engine needs to be 20k lighter.

                            MECHANIC

                  We already tried...

                            NIKI

                  Did you use magnesium parts?

     The MECHANICS look at one another skeptically...

33   INT. BRM WORKSHOPS - NIGHT                                      33

     Shooting from above:

     The entire car has been stripped to a thousand pieces. Now

     spread all over the workshop floor.

     NIKI's team of mechanics reluctantly work through the night

     making the adjustments which NIKI is suggesting...

                            NIKI

                  Any solid plate, strip it out...

     More disbelieving, skeptical looks. The car is in pieces on

     the floor. NIKI brews coffee to keep people alert. Focused.

                            NIKI

                  And when we've done that, we need to

                  look at the aerodynamics. Front and

                  rear wing..

     More mutinous looks. "Who is this asshole?"

34   EXT. BRM WORKSHOPS - FIRST LIGHT                                 34

     Daylight breaks over the race-track. The doors to the workshop

     open, and the MECHANICS and NIKI emerge - their work done.

     NIKI goes to shake hands with the MECHANICS...

                            NIKI

                  OK. Thank you. Good night..

     But they're exhausted. Refuse to shake hands with this nut.

35   EXT. PAUL RICARD CIRCUIT - DAY                                   35

     LATER: one of the BRM cars screams round the race-track...

     NIKI watches on the sidelines as CLAY REGAZZONI is time-

     testing his car. He walks over to where LOUIS STANLEY and

     several MECHANICS are doing the timings...

                            NIKI

                  What was his time?

                            STANLEY

                  Two minutes six seconds.

                            NIKI

                  OK. Now put him in my car, and he'll

                  go round under two minutes.

                            STANLEY

                  Six seconds faster? Impossible.

     NIKI looks up to see AGNES, the attractive TRACK MANAGER again

     on the other side of the track.

     NIKI waves hi. AGNES waves back. Smiles. NIKI raises his

     eyebrow. Surprised.

36   EXT. PAUL RICARD CIRCUIT - DAY                                   36

     REGAZZONI gets into NIKI's car.

                                                                         26

37   EXT. PAUL RICARD CIRCUIT - DAY                                 37

     REGAZZONI races round the track at full speed.

     REGAZZONI roars past the finishing line in NIKI's car. LOUIS

     STANLEY looks at the stop watch..

     His expression changes.

38   INT. PAUL RICARD CIRCUIT - DAY                                 38

     STANLEY comes into the workshop where NIKI and his MECHANICS

     are in conversation, getting changed...

                          STANLEY

                All right. What did you do to the car?

                          NIKI

                That's information I will share with

                you under certain conditions only.

     STANLEY stares, bracing himself..

                           STANLEY

                Go on...

                          NIKI

                A guaranteed place in the team, and a

                paid contract on equal terms with

                Regazzoni for two years.

                          STANLEY

                Are you crazy? Clay's a senior figure

                in Formula One...you're a rookie. The

                only reason we took you ON was because

                you were paying us.

                          NIKI

                Well, as of now, if you want me to

                stay, we rip up the contract. I don't

                pay you a cent.

                          STANLEY

                It's outrageous.

                           NIKI

                Was he quicker in my car? He was,

                wasn't he?

     STANLEY stares...

                          NIKI

                Did he go under two minutes?

                      (quiet)

                  One fifty-six.

                            NIKI

                  So have a think, work out your

                  priorities, and get back to me.

     NIKI turns, and goes. STANLEY stares...

                            STANLEY

                  Not even my WIFE speaks to me like

                  that.

39   EXT. PAUL RICARD CIRCUIT - DAY                                   39

     CLAY REGAZZONI emerges from testing his car. Still amazed by

     the improved performance. Talking to his MECHANICS. In awe.

     He removes his helmet, then stops.

     In the distance he sees NIKI talking to AGNES the attractive

     TRACK MANAGER. They are clearly hitting it off..

40   INT. PAUL RICARD CIRCUIT - WORKSHOPS - LOCKER-ROOM - DAY         40

     NIKI is in the showers, then getting changed for his date with

     AGNES. He is about to go, when he stops, and sees...

     CLAY REGAZZONI getting undressed, looking at NIKI. CLAY speaks

     English with an Italian accent..

                            REGAZZONI

                  I know what you're going to say. That

                  it's none of my business...

                            NIKI

                  What?

                            REGAZZONI

                  If it's the Track Manager you're

                  taking on your date tonight?

     NIKI immediately becomes defensive...

                            NIKI

                  It's none of your business.

                            REGAZZONI

                  Okay, but if you want my advice...I'd

                  let this one go. I'm not questioning

                  your taste. She's a great girl.

                            REGAZZONI (contid)

                  But Agnes's last boyfriend was a

                  British Formula 2 driver, who has a

                  reputation for two things. For being a

                  suicidal jerk on the track, and for

                  going all night, and all day

                  afterwards...and all night again in

                  bed. He's an OK driver, but an

                  IMMORTAL fuck, apparently. I don't

                  know about you, but that's not an act

                  I'd like to follow.

                      (shrugs)

                  But if that doesn't bother you...

                  What's his name? The driver?

                  Hunt. James Hunt.

     NIKI stares. Can hardly believe it.

                            REGAZZONI

                  See? You share information, I share

                  information.

     CLAY slaps NIKI on his back, and goes into the showers..

                            REGAZZONI

                  That's what team-mates are for.

                            NIKI

                      (quiet/defeated)

                  Thanks.

     Easton Neston. Set in 3,300 acres, one of England's great

     country houses. Home to the Fermor-Hesketh family since 1700.

     JAMES and a new GIRLFRIEND drive up the gravel drive in his

     anything but grandiose Mini. It splutters to a stop, just in

     time.

     They are greeted by uniformed STAFF who take his tatty bags

     from his filthy car.

44   INT. HESKETH RACING WORKSHOPS - EASTON NESTON - DAY              44

     The Hesketh Racing workshops, situated in the converted

                          HESKETH

                There! What do you say?

     JAMES opens his eyes to see a gorgeous F1 racing car, plain

     white, no stickers...

                          HESKETH

                Isn't she a beauty? The March 731.

                Converted by the brilliant Doc..!

     DOC POSTLETHWAITE takes a modest bow. JAMES shakes hands with

     everyone, including his brother, (and manager), PETER..

                          JAMES

                She is a beauty. But...haven't you

                made a mistake?

                          HESKETH

                What?

                          JAMES

                That's not a Formula 2 car. She's F1.

                          HESKETH

                She is, Superstar. Why? Because I got

                together with the beancounters, and it

                turns out that the economics of F1 are

                not so significantly different to the

                economics of Formula 2...

     BUBBLES clears his throat, dutifully bites his tongue..

                  So we thought if we were going to be

                  messing about losing money we might as

                  well be doing it with the big boys.

                            JAMES

                  Are you serious?

                            HESKETH

                  Never been more serious in my life!

     JAMES embraces HESKETH in excitement, kisses him...

                            HESKETH

                  Actually, I got the idea after what

                  you said about the Austrian chap who

                  bought his way in rather than waste

                  his time in the lower divisions. I

                  thought, "Bloody hell, he's right!"

     JAMES slips into the cockpit...

                            JAMES

                  Well done the Goosestepper!!

                  No sponsorship, Superstar! I hope you

                  approve.

                            JAMES

                  I do, Patron.

                            HESKETH

                  No vulgar logos for cigarettes, or

                  condoms. Just plain white. With the

                  Union Jack. And racing overalls which

                  read...

                  it's me, of course, in which case it's

                  two kippers, porridge, boiled eggs,

                  and half a dozen slices of toast...

     Laughter.

                            JAMES

                  So when do we start?

                            HESKETH

                  Soon as you're ready.

                That's my boy!

     HESKETH pops champagne...

45   EXT. SPANISH GP - RACE TRACK -27 APRIL 1975- DAY                 45

     To establish: a Formula 1 race track on Grand Prix week-end..

     A helicopter comes in to land.

     The Hesketh Racing Team makes a grand entrance with a retinue

     of BUTLERS, GIRLS, ROLLS' ROYCE's, oysters, champagne...

     A famous ex-champion TV REPORTER is there (Stirling Moss)

     providing skeptical commentary about Hesketh's debut...

                          STIRLING MOSS

                ...hard to tell whether Lord Hesketh

                and his team of upper class

                enthusiasts is bringing glamour to the

                racing community, or just comedy...

     They walk around in their own branded clothing. Alexander's

     jacket reads, "Le Patron". He speaks to MOSS.

     Rolled eyes among other racing teams who express surprise,

     curiosity (and frequently disapproval) at these new arrivals..

                          STIRLING MOSS

                It's certainly the first time I can

                remember seeing a butler serving

                caviar and oysters in the pits...

     Suddenly pandemonium breaks out. Screams. Something has

     happened. A bad accident on the track. During testing...

                          STIRLING MOSS

                    (holding ear-piece)

                ...reports are reaching me of a

                serious accident that has just taken

                place in qualifying....

     All smiles fade. The party atmosphere changes in a flash.

     Panic breaks out.

     The sound of sirens. Ambulances rushing to the scene of the

     accident. All the JOURNALISTS and TV CREWS rush off, too.

                                                         (CONTINUED)

     HESKETH, BUBBLES and JAMES look at one another, put down their

     champagne glasses, and follow...

46   EXT. RACE TRACK - SPAIN - DAY                                    46

     Mangled wreckage. A car has crashed into (badly installed)

     Armco guard rails, splitting the railing in two...

     The DRIVER has been decapitated. His helmeted HEAD lies

     cleanly severed on the ground...

     A goldfish-bowl of blood.

     It's a horrific accident. People SCREAM and look away. Even

     hardened medical professionals...

     JAMES, HESKETH, BUBBLES arrive on the scene of the accident.

     But they are kept away, at a distance...

                            STIRLING MOSS

                  ...it seems the driver...just twenty-

                  six years old....was killed on

                  impact...and the death toll in Formula

                  1 shows no sign of slowing down...

47   INT. HESKETH PITS - SPANISH GRAND PRIX - DAY                     47

     JAMES, dressed in his overalls, is violently retching. Sick

     with nerves. A TV plays in the pits...

                            COMMENTATOR

                  ...in the last five years alone

                  Formula 1 has lost Piers Courage, Jo

                  Siffert, Peter Revson, Jochen Rindt,

                  Francois Cevert, Roger Williamson...

     ON TV: quickfire clips of the terrible, violent deaths.

     BUBBLES hastily switches off the TV as JAMES walks past...

48   EXT. PADDOCK - DAY                                               48

     JAMES walks out of the paddock, towards his car. Other DRIVERS

     gathered in concerned groups, talking...

                            DRIVER (O.S.)

                  It's terrible.

                            JAMES

                  They should cancel the race.

     Then, a distinctive Austrian accent..

                  Why? No one came to see him anyway.

                  He made a mistake. Went into the

                  corner too fast.

                            JAMES

                  Is that right? So says the nobody who

                  had to pay for his own drive. How's

                  that working out, by the way?

                            NIKI

                  Fine. How's it at the back?

                            JAMES

                  Not planning on being there for long.

                            NIKI

                  Good. Look forward to you showing me

                  the way today.

                            JAMES

                  `Be happy to. I'll have you inside lap

                  one.

                            NIKI

                  Yeah right.

     JAMES walks off to his car, shaking his head..

                             JAMES

                  Asshole.

     NIKI walks to his car, putting on his helmet.

     His eyes meet JAMES's..

60   INT. BAR - HOTEL - NIGHT                                         60

     JAMES and BUBBLES and PETER HUNT (JAMES's blazer-wearing

     manager and elder brother), sit together at a table in the

     corner. It's late. A frank post-mortem. Drinking and talking..

                          JAMES

                Niki humiliated me today. He lapped me

                three times.

                          BUBBLES

                He lapped Carlos Pace six times.

                          JAMES

                That's supposed to console me? What do

                I need to do?

                           PETER

                Grow up.

                          JAMES

                Shut up, Moneyman. `Didn't ask you..

                           BUBBLES

                Your brother's right. You've got to

                change your attitude. We all do. And

                match it with a whole different mental

                approach. Professionalism. Maturity.

                Like Niki.

                Bet he doesn't go out every night,

                drink and screw himself stupid.

                          JAMES

                So speaks the jealous married man..

                No. So speaks the manager who's

                wasting his time, making ten per cent

                of absolutely nothing.

                  Something he's never done.

                  setting up the car. That's what Lauda

                  does. 24 hours a day.

     JAMES rolls his eyes...

                  God knows there's nothing wrong with

     JAMES is in the workshops, his hands and arms filthy, he's

     been working on the car - but now his eyes are closed.

     Memorizing tracks. Around him people are working on the car..

                          JAMES

                ....along the Beau Rivage, long left

                into Massenet, into the short right of

                Casino. Sharp right into Mirabeau,

                then sharp left into Loews, mind the

                guard rails...

                          VOICE

                Is Alexander around..?

     JAMES opens his eyes to see an endless pair of legs, a drop-

     dead gorgeous figure, and the beautiful smiling face of SUZY

     MILLER, the most successful model of the day.

                          JAMES

                He was. Then went to the house to take

                a call. He'll be back shortly.

                           SUZY

                Only he wanted to show off his pride

                and joy...

     SUZY indicates the car...

                          SUZY

                ...rhymes with `boy' if you ask me.

                And `toy'. I can't believe what I'm

                seeing.

                          JAMES

                Why?

                          SUZY

                It's just so small! For something that

                costs so much. And so flimsy. There's

                no comfort. No protection. Nothing.

                          JAMES

                No. Just a little coffin, surrounded

                by high-octane fuel, being driven

                round at 170 miles per hour..

                      (becoming grave)

                  To all intents and purposes a bomb. On

                  wheels.

                            SUZY

                  Why don't they make it safer?

                            JAMES

                  No one wants it to be. It's like

                  saying why not make bullfighting

                  safer? It's a blood sport. The risk of

                  death turns people on. Without it, I

                  guess, it'd be half the fun. Which is

                  fine for the voyeurs, fine for TV,

                  fine for everyone..

                      (a beat)

                  ...except us drivers.

     SUZY looks JAMES up and down. Sees the bare feet, the rock

     star good looks...

                            SUZY

                  You're James, aren't you?

                             JAMES

                  Yes.

                            SUZY

                  Thought so. You fit the description.

                      (shaking hands)

                  Suzy. Friend of Alex's.

                            JAMES

                  I know exactly.

     In the background: one of the MECHANICS shows DOC a picture of

     SUZY from a tabloid newspaper. She's clearly the most famous

     model in Britain, and a star in her own right...

                            JAMES

                  What was the description?

                            SUZY

                  Mostly positive in terms of

                  appearance. Negative only in terms of

                  character. I've been told to avoid

                  you.

                             JAMES

                  By whom?

                            SUZY

                  Alex. He says you're a bad boy.

                Was. Not any more. New me very

                professional. Early to bed. Early to

                rise. All very dull.

                          SUZY

                Really?

                          JAMES

                Round-the-clock work, practise and

                focus. Tedious, but apparently the

                only way to vin against ze

                Goosestepper..

                          SUZY

                Is that what you were doing when you

                came in?

                          JAMES

                Visualization techniques. Memorizing

                the circuit, in this case Monaco,

                which is next up. Eyes closed, know

                your way round in your sleep...

                    (a beat)

                I know...I've always been a great

                believer in getting there on the day,

                putting the old foot down and playing

                chicken with everyone else.

     SUZY laughs..

                          JAMES

                But they don't want me to do that

                anymore...they want my body like a

                temple. My mind like Monk.

                          SUZY

                And your soul? Your heart?

                          JAMES

                What does that mean?

                          SUZY

                You can't be so disciplined in all

                areas of your life, can you..?

                          JAMES

                They want me to stop messing around,

                get married and settle down with the

                next nice girl I meet. They think it

                would be good for me.

                          SUZY

                What do you think?

                Sounds bloody awful.

     SUZY laughs again...

                           JAMES

                But since they're right about most

                things, they're probably right about

                that, too.

     JAMES looks SUZY up and down...

                          JAMES

                You don't fancy getting married, do

                you?

     JAMES and SUZY, top hat and tails, flowing white wedding

     dress, looking ravishing, emerge from the church.

     JAMES and SUZY fall into a passionate, sexy embrace for the

     paparazzi cameras. Loud cheers go up, led by HESKETH and

     BUBBLES.

     They make their way to the waiting convoy of cars...

     On his way: JAMES spots a serious-faced HESKETH and DOC

     POSTLETHWAITE in conversation with some Formula 1 types in the

     crowd..

     SUZY is pulled away for photos. Clearly a bigger star even

     than JAMES. JAMES turns to BUBBLES, indicates HESKETH...

                What's up?

                          BUBBLES

                Nothing. I don't want to ruin your

                day.

     BUBBLES stares, then reluctantly...

                  little longer than you'd hoped.

                  the world. They could have ANYONE. Did

                  he pay his way in there, too?

                            BUBBLES

                  Apparently they took back Regazzoni

                  and he insisted they give Lauda a

                  trial. Thinks he's a genius. Setting

                  up the cars...

                  What we do? It's passion. Love. Which

                  is why we're prepared to risk our

                  Why am I an asshole? You know by now

                  I'm both quicker than you and better

                  with that, then you're the asshole.

                  I brought you along today because you

                  seem like a lonely kind of guy. I

     NIKI stares through the window. Inside: a very appealing

     looking bunch - young, good-looking, cool, sexy GUESTS - all

     having a good time..

     By contrast: NIKI catches his own reflection in the glass

     reflection. Pale. Intense. The outsider.

     Inside: REGAZZONI is surrounded by friends, telling a story.

     Everyone laughs.

     NIKI watches. Then turns to walk away. As he goes, the front

     door opens...

     And a beautiful dark-haired woman (MARLENE) emerges loading

     several BAGS into a car. Brunette, tan. Wearing a white dress.

                          NIKI

                          MARLENE

                Sure. Nearest town is half an hour's

                drive. Get in.

     The car drives. The radio plays. Marlene sings along. NIKI

     can't help noticing something. He turns down the music.

     MARLENE's smile fades..

                          MARLENE

                What are you doing?

                  You hear that noise when you

                  accelerate?

                             MARLENE

                  No.

                            NIKI

                  Your drive belt is loose.

                             MARLENE

                  My what?

                            NIKI

                  Alternator. And when you brake, your

                  foot goes all the way down. Means

                  there's air in the system.

                            MARLENE

                  Anything else?

                            NIKI

                  No. Apart from the rear brakes are

                  imbalanced. The front right wheel is

                  flat, and it feels like a crack in the

                  engine block...which explains why

                  you're drifting so much.

                            MARLENE

                  How can you tell?

                             NIKI

                  My ass.

                             MARLENE

                  What?

                            NIKI

                  God gave me an OK mind, but a really

                  good ass, which can feel everything in

                  a car.

                            MARLENE

                  You don't know what you're talking

                  about. The car is fine. And it just

                  had a service a week ago.

                            NIKI

                  Not a good one.

                            MARLENE

                  A very good one. From a proper garage.

                  It cost a fortune. This car is good as

                  new. Relax.

                                                                          45

79   EXT. MOTORWAY - HARD SHOULDER - DAY                             79

     White smoke pours from the engine. The car has broken down.

     Bonnet up. NIKI has tried fixing it, but to no avail.

     NIKI has a fan belt in his hand, but it's all but

     disintegrated under the heat of the over-worked engine.

     NIKI's hands are covered in oil. He is pushing a pen into a

     large crack in the engine, slick with oil and grease.

                          NIKI

                Nothing I can do here. The car needs a

                garage.

                          MARLENE

                I'm sorry. You're not in a hurry, are

                you?

                          NIKI

                No. As long as I'm back in Maranello

                by Monday morning.

     NIKI walks out into the road. Sticks out his thumb...

                          MARLENE

                So who are you anyway?

     MARLENE breaks into GERMAN...(we see sub-titles)...

                          MARLENE

                You're from Vienna, aren't you. We can

                speak German. How do you know Curd?

                          NIKI

                Who's Curd?

                          MARLENE

                Curd Jurgens. The actor. It's his

                house. He is, or was until yesterday,

                my boyfriend. I must have been mad!

                There is something very attractive

                about an older man when they behave

                like one. But when they behave like a

                frightened child..

     MARLENE gets to her feet...

                           MARLENE

                C'mon, let me do this. Otherwise we'll

                never get out of here. We're in Italy,

                after all.

     MARLENE indicates that NIKI should take a back seat, hitches

     up her skirt, showing long, tanned legs..

     Immediately a passing car screeches to a halt, then reverses

     noisily to pull level. MARLENE smiles at NIKI...

                            MARLENE

                  Not bad, eh? Three seconds. Admit it,

                  you're impressed..!

     MARLENE smiles flirtatiously at the handsome, young Italian

     MEN driving the open-topped sports car..

                            MARLENE

                  Ciao, Regazzi...!

     But the Italian MEN walk right past her, not seeing her, as if

     she's invisible, and stare at NIKI...

                            ITALIAN MAN

                      (in Italian)

                  Excuse me...are you Niki Lauda?

                            NIKI

                  Yes.

                            ITALIAN MAN

                      (in Italian)

                  Oh, my God...!!! I told you it was

                  him..!!!

                      (blown away)

                  Do you need a ride?

                            NIKI

                  Yes, we do...

     The ITALIAN MAN gestures to his car, as his friend loads

     MARLENE's luggage inside...

                            ITALIAN MAN

                  An honour, please!!! But on one

                  condition..

     The ITALIAN MAN whisper in NIKI's ear. MARLENE stares, not

     understanding, as NIKI protests, but then slowly, reluctantly

     gets into the car. He starts the engine.

     MARLENE watches as the ITALIAN MEN strap themselves in with

     the seat-belts, tightening them...giggling like schoolboys..

                            MARLENE

                  Will someone please tell me what's

                  going on?

     MARLENE turns to NIKI...

                Who are you, anyway? What do you DO?

                          ITALIAN MAN

                You don't know? He's a Formula I

                driver. Who just signed for Ferrari!

                          MARLENE

                Him? Never. Impossible!

                            ITALIAN MAN

                Why?

                          MARLENE

                Formula 1 drivers have long hair, are

                sexy, have shirts open to here..

     MARLENE indicates...

                          MARLENE

                Anyway, look at the way he's driving!!

                Like an old man!!

     It's true. NIKI is driving in the slow lane. Like a pensioner.

                          NIKI

                No need to drive fast. It only

                increases the percentage of risk.

                We're not in a hurry. No one is paying

                me. Right now, with zero incentive or

                reward, why would I drive fast?

     MARLENE looks at him with her dark green eyes...

                          MARLENE

                    (in German)

                Because I'm asking you to.

                          NIKI

                    (in German)

                And do you always get what you want?

                    (in German)

                Usually.

     NIKI stares, trying to resist...but cannot. He does a

     lightning double-declutch...

     "SLAM", NIKI's foot hits the floor, the engine screams, the

     rev counter flies to the right...

     And the open-topped sports car lurches into warp-drive...

     MARLENE is thrown back hard in her seat, "Jesus", her eyes

     widen in terror and amazement..

                          MARLENE

                Oh, my God...!!

     The ITALIAN MEN scream in excitement, holding on for dear life

     as NIKI, his heart not a beat over 60, takes the car to

     breaking point, in a way it's never been driven before...

     NIKI overtakes everyone on the motorway, fearlessly weaving

     between cars at twice their speed..

     We CLOSE on NIKI's eyes, remaining dead calm as his passengers

     scream all around him, as he accelerates through the other

     cars on the motorway...

     His EYES remain calm, his WHEELS a blur of speed, and we...

                                                       MATCH CUT TO:

80   EXT. USA GP - WATKINS GLEN - 5TH OCTOBER 1975 - TRACK - DAY      80

     Calm EYES, and WHEELS moving in a blur of speed. We're in the

     middle of a Grand Prix, and NIKI is driving at the limit...

     CAPTION: "1975".

     Ahead of him: a familiar sight. The back of JAMES HUNT's

     Hesketh..

81   EXT. PITS - DAY                                                  81

     MARLENE watches on TV in the pits as NIKI is engaged in an

     epic tussle with JAMES...

     Commentators note the improvement in JAMES's technique,

     maturity and performance. But then, "Puff", a plume of smoke

     comes out of JAMES's engine. The engine has blown...

     Immediately JAMES loses speed, and NIKI sails past, overtaking

     effortlessly. Taking the chequered flag.

     Television commentary in various languages tells us: NIKI

     LAUDA has become world champion...

82   EXT. FERRARI PITS/USA GP TRACK SIDE - DAY                        82

     NIKI's car pulls in, to be mobbed by jubilant MECHANICS as he

     delighted LUCA DI MONTEZEMOLO...

     Champion of the World, he is immediately swallowed up by

     REPORTERS who are demanding interviews in Italian, German,

     An impromptu party in the paddock area. The victor's garland

     still round his neck, proudly holding the FIA World Champion

     trophy, his hair matted with champagne, NIKI passes through

     the crowds, accepting everyone's congratulations..

     He runs into JAMES, who's in bare feet as usual. MARLENE is

     pulled away to talk to someone else..

                            JAMES

                  Congratulations.

                               NIKI

                  Thank you.

                            JAMES

                  Though with a car like that, the rest

                  of us never stood a chance...

                            NIKI

                  Maybe the fact the car is so good

                  might have something to do with me.

                            JAMES

                  You're still in a Ferrari. And I'm

                  still in a Hesketh. On equal terms,

                  the way it was in Formula 3, I'd beat

                  you, and you know it.

                            NIKI

                  Never. You might get lucky and win one

                  race. Maybe two. Because you're

                  aggressive. But in the long run, over

                  the course of a season, no chance.

                            JAMES

                  Why's that?

                            NIKI

                  Because you're not serious. You're

                  just a party guy. Which is why

                  everyone likes you.

                            JAMES

                  Now try saying that and tell me you're

                  not jealous.

                  But all that affection, all those

                  smiles is also a sign of their

                  disrespect! They don't fear you.

                  Whereas compare that to me...

                            JAMES

                  Whom no one likes...

                            NIKI

                  Right..

                            JAMES

                  Not even his own team-mates..

                            NIKI

                  Right! Because I'm relentless. I don't

                  screw up. I go to bed early. I look

                  after myself, look after my car. And

                  then, soon as the race is finished, I

                  go home. You should go home more

                  often, too. I heard you got married.

                            JAMES

                  I did.

                            NIKI

                  So where is she?

                            JAMES

                  In New York. Working.

                  You know I've never seen you with her,

                  once...

     NIKI turns to MARLENE, "Let's go"..

84   EXT. EASTON NESTON - DAY                                        84

     JAMES's Mini roars furiously up the long gravel driveway

     towards Easton Neston. Screeches to a halt.

     JAMES gets out of the car. Is greeted by staff, whom he

     uncharacteristically ignores, storming past...

85   INT. EASTON NESTON - WORKSHOP - DAY                             85

     JAMES walks into the workshops where BUBBLES HORSLEY is busy

     doing something...

                                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                                           51

85   CONTINUED:                                                    85

                            JAMES

                  Right, whatever it takes to beat

                  Lauda, just say it, your word is my

                  command. I'll do it. There are no

                  lengths to which I will not go. And I

                  mean it this time...

     JAMES stops, noticing BUBBLES's expression...

                            JAMES

                  What's the matter?

     Then JAMES notices what BUBBLES is doing. He's packing.

                            JAMES

                  What are you doing?

     Then JAMES notices the lack of activity in the workshops. None

     of the usual mechanics, or engineers..

                            JAMES

                  Where is everyone?

     BUBBLES looks up. Unsure how to break it to him.

86   INT. DRAWING-ROOM - EASTON NESTON - DAY                          86

     An old drawing-room. The open fire roars. But HESKETH is

     uncharacteristically quiet. Defeated..

                            HESKETH

                  Do you know what the date is today?

                            JAMES

                  November 14th.

                            HESKETH

                  Do you have any idea of the

                  significance of that date?

                            JAMES

                  I'm assuming it refers to some animal

                  you are allowed or no longer allowed

                  to slaughter on your estate.

                            HESKETH

                  Actually it's the deadline for

                  securing sponsorship for the

                  forthcoming Formula 1 season.

                      (a beat)

                  Which elapsed at midnight last night.

                  And we didn't attract any.

                            JAMES

                  So? We aren't looking for sponsorship.

                  Condoms and cigarettes. Vulgar, right?

                            HESKETH

                  Right. Except we are. Or were. I've

                  made something of a miscalculation.

                  The economics. Formula 1. Reality

                  thereof. Turns out not like the lower

                  divisions at all.

                            JAMES

                  What are you saying?

                            HESKETH

                  I'm saying it's over, Superstar. The

                  banks have stepped in. Read me the

                  riot act. Started laying everyone off.

                  Probably have to sell this place. Fun

                  while it lasted, would do it all again

                  and all that...

                      (ashen)

                  I daren't tell you the actual figures.

     JAMES stares at a devastated HESKETH...

                            JAMES

                  Christ.

87   INT. JAMES'S FLAT - LONDON - NIGHT                              87

     JAMES is on the phone to his brother PETER, while playing

     Scale-electrix cars on a track alone, barefoot...

                            JAMES

                  I need a drive, Pete. Need you to find

                  me a drive.

                      (listens)

                  What does that mean? "My reputation

                  precedes me?"

     "Crash", the electric toy car crashes...

                             JAMES

                      (listens)

                  Really? Is that what they said?

                      (a beat)

                  Did they at least say a "Quick

                  arsehole?"

                      (listens)

                  Bollocks to Lotus. Find me someone

                  else. I'll go mad otherwise.

     "Click", JAMES hangs up. SUZY walks in. Sees his mood..

                            SUZY

                  Don't worry. Something will turn up.

     JAMES opens a bottle of Scotch, pours himself a drink...

                            SUZY

                  But I doubt that will help in the

                  meantime.

     JAMES knocks back the drink...

                            SUZY

                  Why don't we go away for the week-end?

                  Before I leave again for New York?

     JAMES carries on drinking..

                            SUZY

                  Talk to me, James. Don't make a

                  stranger of me.

     JAMES doesn't react...

                            SUZY

                  I can't watch this.

     SUZY picks up her coat, and bag..

                            JAMES

                  What were you hoping for? A well-

                  adjusted knight in shining armour?

                            SUZY

                  No danger of that....

                            JAMES

                  Let me give you some advice.

                            SUZY

                  I'm all ears...

                            JAMES

                  Don't go to men who are willing to

                  kill themselves driving in circles

                  looking for normality.

                            SUZY

                  Well, I certainly didn't get that...

                            JAMES

                  Should have gone for one of my

                  brothers.

                There goes that self-pity again.

                How striking it is -

                          JAMES

                What's that? Tell me..

                          SUZY

                The gulf between appearance and

                reality. Look at you, all sunshine

                blonde beauty and smiles...yet the

                reality is...a frightened, immature,

                depressed, self-pitying child...

                          JAMES

                At least there's SOMETHING behind the

                facade.

                          SUZY

                With a nasty temper..

                          JAMES

                Fuck off to New York, dear. There must

                be a moisturizer or eye shadow

                somewhere that needs your vapid mush

                to flog it.

                          SUZY

                How quickly beauty can turn ugly.

                          JAMES

                Agreed. Repellent.

     SUZY stares...and goes. JAMES carries on drinking.

     The following morning. The phone rings. Piercing the darkness.

     JAMES, clearly the worse for wear, is talking to his beloved

     budgies...

                          JAMES

                Good girl...

     A surprising vulnerability, and childlike innocence about

     him sit up...

                            JAMES (INTO PHONE)

                  Who? McLaren?

     JAMES is waking rapidly now..

                  Just get me in a room with them, Pete.

                      (checks watch)

                  I can be there in an hour.

     JAMES starts scribbling down the address.

91   EXT. MCLAREN HQ - TO ESTABLISH                                   91

     The headquarters of McLaren Racing in Colnbrook, Bucks.

     A small, unassuming building on the Poyle Trading Estate. Bare

     brickwork surrounds a brash yellow facade, with the words

     `MCLAREN RACING' in large white letters.

92   INT. MCLAREN HQ - BOARDROOM - DAY                                92

     A large boardroom. Team Director TEDDY MAYER (American, from

     Pennsylvania, short, lawyerly, 50's - hair turning grey) sits

     at the head of the table.

     Next to him is Aussie Marlboro spokesman JOHN HOGAN and

     McLaren Team Manager and chief mechanic ALASTAIR CALDWELL.

     The atmosphere is tense, uncomfortable...

                            MAYER

                  I'll come straight to the point. Our

                  esteemed lead driver...

                            CALDWELL

                  Fitti-fucking-paldi..

                  And we need a replacement. Asap.

                  Thankfully a few hands have already

                  gone up. Good people...

                            CALDWELL

                  Like Jackie Ickx.

                            JAMES

                  I'm quicker than Jackie.

                            MAYER

                  But he's consistent, dependable.

                  Sponsor friendly. He'll dress up nice.

                  Say the right things.

                            JAMES

                  What do you want? A driver or a

                  brushes salesman?

                            MAYER

                  We want to be successful.

                            JAMES

                  So do I. But I measure that in podium

                  finishes and beating Niki Lauda not

                  being a show pony for sponsors.

                            MAYER

                  I've heard about this thing with

                  Lauda.

                            CALDWELL

                      (rolls eyes)

                  Everyone has..

                            MAYER

                  You really think you can beat him?

                  He's World Champion.

                            JAMES

                  I beat him in Formula 3.

                            CALDWELL

                  This season alone he's had eight

                  podiums, five wins, you've had what?

                            HOGAN

                  One.

                            JAMES

                  Only because I've been in the wrong

                  car. I beat him when the playing field

                  was level. I'd beat him again in a

                  McLaren.

                begging.

     JAMES stares imploringly..

                          JAMES

                I'll do whatever you ask. Even put on

                a suit, talk to sponsors and say the

                right thing. I promise.

                 He drives in an illegal car and he

                 calls ME the cheat? Let me tell you:

                 two weeks before that race in Spain,

                 we put 20-inch rims on the rear

                 wheels. We get an extra half second

                 speed on each lap!! But the Old Man

                 tells me we can't use those rims, they

                 make the car too wide. Against the

                 rules. So we go back to 19-inch rims

                 making the car slower again. Rules are

                 rules. For all of us. You're just a

                 bad loser who can't accept that.

                     (tapping head, to MARLENE)

                 Komm, he's crazy. Sick in the head.

121 INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY                                         121

   A large hotel suite. There are flowers everywhere. Newspapers

   are all over the table.

   JAMES sits opposite SUZY. He sees an expensive gift; recently

   opened. A diamond necklace..

                           JAMES

                 That from him?

   SUZY nods. Even the uninitiated eye can tell: it's worth a

   fortune.

                                                          (CONTINUED)

                                                                        65

121 CONTINUED:                                                    121

                           SUZY

                 Why have you come here, James?

                           JAMES

                 To get you back.

                           SUZY

                 You don't want me back...you never

                 wanted to be married in the first

                 place. You did it because you hoped it

                 might change you...settle you down...

                 help with the racing. Not because you

                 loved me. And who knows, if it had

                 been just the drinking, or the dope,

                 or the infidelity, or the moods...it

                 might even have worked...but when it's

                 all of them?

                           JAMES

                 I know. I'm terrible.

                           SUZY

                 No, you're not terrible. You're

                 just...who you are...at this point in

                 your life. And God help anyone that

                 wants more.

                           JAMES

                 Will he be able to give you more? He

                 has quite the bad boy reputation

                 himself.

                           SUZY

                 What's important is how it feels to

                 me. And it feels like he adores me.

   A flicker behind JAMES's eyes. Failure.

                           JAMES

                 Right.

                           SUZY

                 He's aware of the delicacy of the

                 situation, and how it looks. Having

                 raided your larder. Plundered your

                 safe. Smash and grab, and so forth. So

                 he's assured me he'll take care of the

                 financial side. And will be very

                 generous.

   JAMES manages a brave smile.

                           JAMES

                 Fine. I'll give him a call.

                                                          (CONTINUED)

               No. His lawyers will contact you.

   JAMES notices the vast unmade bed. Where, until recently, two

   people had slept.

121AEXT. HOTEL - MANHATTAN - DAY                                  121A

   JAMES emerges from the hotel - into the storm of paparazzi

   again. He manages a brave smile...

                         JAMES

               It's all very amicable. My wife has

               found herself a new backer...I mean

               lover...which makes her happy..

                   (laughter)

               Mr. Burton has found a way of feeling

               young again...let's hope his pockets

               are deep...they'll need to be...

                   (laughter)

               And I've found a way to be single

               again without it costing me a penny,

               which has to go down as the biggest

               win of my career.

   Laughter from the JOURNALISTS who are hungrily writing down

   the copy. But JAMES's hollow smile fools no one...

122 INT. JUMBO JET - FIRST CLASS - DAY                             122

   JAMES sits alone in the first class section. A loser on the

   track, and a loser in love, too. Being played out in the full

   glare of publicity. On the front pages. Being read by everyone

   on the plane.

   A STEWARDESS looks over, catches his eye. Smiles.

123 INT. JUMBO JET - WC - DAY                                      123

   JAMES and the STEWARDESS fucking. Hard.

   Nothing to do with pleasure. An analgesic - a way of blocking

   out the pain. JAMES catches his own reflection in the mirror.

   Teeth clenched. Eyes burning with anger and self-loathing...

   OVER THIS: we fade in the ROAR of car engines...

123AINT. FRENCH GP 1976 - PAUL RICARD - 4TH JULY 1976             123A

   JAMES's teeth still clenched. Eyes still burning with anger.

   Driving flat out. At the limit.

   Suzy's words still ringing in his ears.

   Make that beyond the limit. At the point of no return. The car

   shaking. Weaving recklessly through other cars...

   Where death has become a real option.

   Because he doesn't care anymore. Because it's all he deserves

   anyway...

   And in that moment, in reaching his lowest point, JAMES has

   unwittingly stumbled on the one thing that gives him an

   advantage over everyone else...

   The fact that he doesn't care. The fact that death has become

   an option. The fact that there is no risk he is not prepared

   to take...

   So every corner is tighter, every braking point later, every

   gap is an opening, no matter how tiny...

   copse of trees. Out of sight.

   When they re-emerge, JAMES is ahead of NIKI, having overtaken

   him - to the delight of the partisan crowd.

   The chequered flag waves again as JAMES's car roars across the

   JAMES screams in catharsis and triumph. Teeth clenched. Eyes

                 disqualification of driver James Hunt

                 from the Spanish Grand Prix, it has

                 been decided to overturn this

                 disqualification...and to restore his

                 victory, and reinstate his points..

   A crowded PRESS room. In opposite corners of the room, JAMES

   and NIKI are giving interviews to different PRESS and TV

   journalists. Stirling Moss is talking to JAMES...

                           STIRLING MOSS

                 ...James, a few weeks ago, you were

                 out of the running for this season

                 completely, now you're right back in

                 it. What's changed...?

   Screaming GIRLS in the background, shouting "James, we love

   you." JAMES stares across the room at NIKI...

                           JAMES

                 A combination of factors, not all of

                 which I'm prepared to discuss here.

                 Justice being done re: the

                 disqualification in Spain helps, and

                 having my old car back of course...

   In the other corner: NIKI is doing his interviews in German,

                 Mathematically in theory it's now

                 possible for Hunt to catch you. Are

                 you worried?

                           NIKI

                 Not at all. For him to catch me, he'd

                 have to win all the remaining races,

                 and I'd have to lose them. And pigs

                 would have to fly.

   Laughter among the confident GERMANS.

                           NIKI

                 Now if you'll excuse me, I have a

                 private family matter to attend to.

   NIKI takes MARLENE's hand, and leads her away.

   NIKI and MARLENE get married. In stark contrast to JAMES's

   wedding...it's a small, intimate affair. Modest. Not showy.

   Away from the cameras. Just them. And a witness from the pub.

134 EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY                                            134

   NIKI and an INSTRUCTOR are in the plane. In the cockpit. With

   MARLENE, who watches...

   NIKI is learning to fly.

   MARLENE watches as NIKI soaks up the instruction, asking

   questions, happy. It's another side to him, completely.

   Honeymooning.

   Then NIKI's expression changes. His smile fades.

   MARLENE walks through the house, looking for NIKI. Then finds

   him on a balcony...alone..

                         MARLENE

               Come to bed.

   MARLENE notices his mood. It's different.

                         MARLENE

               What's the matter?

                         NIKI

               It's the enemy, you know. Happiness.

   NIKI looks up at MARLENE...

                         NIKI

               It weakens you. Puts doubt in your

               mind. Because all of a sudden you have

               something to lose..

   MARLENE stares at him.

                         MARLENE

               When you call happiness an enemy, then

               it's too late.

                   (a beat)

               Then you have lost already.

   MARLENE turns, and goes..

   NIKI is left alone. We can tell from his expression, he is

   struggling with something for the first time. Fear.

   NIKI's face: visibly pale. More frightened than ever.

   Heavy rain falling.

   Television commentary informs us about the Nurburgring's

   terrible reputation as a `graveyard' track.

                           NIKI

                 Thank you. I called this meeting

                 because as all drivers know the

                 Nurburgring is a race track from the

                 Stone Ages. The most stupid, barbaric,

                 outdated, dangerous, track in the

                 world. You've all seen the rain which

                 has been falling this morning. Those

                 of you with experience know the Ring

                 needs perfect conditions to be even

                 remotely acceptable in terms of risk.

                 As you can see today is anything BUT

                 perfect, so I called this meeting to

                 take a vote to cancel the race.

   A ripple of astonished reactions among the drivers..

                            NIKI

                 There would be no change to the

                 situation as far as points is

                 concerned. The race would simply be

                 cancelled.

   TEDDY MAYER looks over at FERRARI representatives....

                           MAYER

   Another DRIVER (GUY EDWARDS) gets to his feet...

                           EDWARDS

                 If the race is cancelled, none of us

                 get our race fees...

                           NIKI

                 It's true. You leave without your fee,

                 but you might leave with your LIFE.

   Another voice pierces the controversy...

                           VOICE

                 It also means you would effectively

                 win the championship.

   It's JAMES HUNT, who is standing up...

                           JAMES

                 So I can see why this suits you just

                 fine.

                           NIKI

                 Why? There would be no points for me

                 either...

                                                          (CONTINUED)

                         JAMES

               But there would be one race less where

               I, or anyone else, could catch you.

   Uproar in the room...

                         BRETT LUNGER

               James is right! This is just tactics!

                         ARTURO MERZARIO

               Ferrari's dirty tricks! We've seen it

               before!

                         HARALD ERTL

               Maybe it's just that he's frightened?

   Laughter among the DRIVERS...

                         NIKI

               Which asshole said this?

   Silence. No hand goes up. No one has the courage to own up.

                         NIKI

               Yes, I am frightened. Always a little

               bit when I race. I accept every time I

               get in my car there is 20% chance that

               I could die. But not one per cent

               more. And today, with the rain the

               risk IS more. How dare you accuse me

               of lack of courage? Let me remind you.

               I have the track record here. I am the

               only person in history to do the Ring

               in under 7 minutes. So actually it's

               to my ADVANTAGE to race here today.

               Because I'm quicker than all of you.

   A stunned silence. One voice pierces the room...

                         JAMES

               Fine. Then let's race!

   It's JAMES who stares at NIKI: a ripple of excitement and

   enthusiasm among the other drivers...

                         JAMES

               There's a hundred thousand fans out

               there who would never forgive us if we

               didn't.

                         MERZARIO

               And some of us need our race fees!!

               All those in favour of cancelling the

               race?

   NIKI puts his hand up. One or two other racers, too...

                         FIA OFFICIAL

               All those in favour of racing?

   JAMES puts his hand up. Clearly the more popular, charismatic

   figure among the DRIVERS, everyone else follows.

                         FIA OFFICIAL

               Gentlemen, start your engines!!

   A clear victory for JAMES. He has swung the room.

   Everyone leaves the room. JAMES and TEDDY MAYER give one

   another a discreet hi-five...

   But we rack focus through the crowd to see NIKI staring at

   JAMES accusingly...holding his gaze.

143 EXT. STARTING GRID - DAY                                       143

   "RRRROAAAR", an explosion of noise, as we widen and find

   ourselves on the starting grid of the German Grand Prix.

   An OFFICIAL walks through the cars holding aloft a sign, "One

   Minute"...

   Deafening, angry thunder, as cars rev their engines.

143AAN EYE FLICKERS - WIDE OPEN - STARING INTENTLY                143A

   A pupil dilates and contracts in the light. The eye stares.

   Blinks. Thinks. Making evaluations..

144 EXT. CLOUDY SKY - GERMANY - DAY                                144

   This time the eye belongs to JAMES. He stares up at the

   clouds.

   His eyelids flicker. Thinking. Agonizing. Wrestling with an

   all important decision...

   Is it going to carry on raining? Or become dry?

   ALASTAIR CALDWELL comes up to JAMES, and shouts above the

   noise - no time to plug his headset in...

                                                          (CONTINUED)

                           CALDWELL

                 Jochen's going on slicks. You want to

                 change?

   JAMES looks in his wing-mirror back to his colleague, JOCHEN

   MASS's car, number 12, several rows behind him.

   White helmet. A team of Mclaren MECHANICS hastily changing the

   tyres to bald, dry tyres - ('slicks'). Then JAMES looks over

   at the car beside him...

                           JAMES

                 Has Niki changed?

                           CALDWELL

                 No. He's going on wets.

   NIKI's car: surrounded by Italian Ferrari MECHANICS.

                           JAMES

                 Then we go on wets, too.

   JAMES pulls down his visor...as he and NIKI's eyes meet for a

   split-second, then...

   The STARTER waves the flag. They're off!

   JAMES's foot hits the floor - his engine screams at almost

   9,000 rpms, drowning out the roar of the 180,000 crowd. The

   car is catapaulted forward, the wheel-spin leaving livid black

   scars on the asphalt..

   JAMES and NIKI both make good starts, and are neck and neck,

   but within seconds there's a McLaren right behind them,

   gaining fast.

   JAMES realizes it's his team-mate, JOCHEN MASS in a white

   helmet. Number 12. On his slick tyres.

   MASS was right to gamble on the track drying out. JAMES curses

   under his breath...

                            JAMES

                 Shit...!

   JAMES screwed up. Made the wrong decision. He urgently needs

   to change tyres. With barely one lap completed...

   He swerves angrily into the pits..

                                                                         76

145 INT. PITS - DAY                                                145

   Commentary from all the world's TV stations explaining the

   crazy, panicked situation as JAMES comes into the pits to

   change to dry tyres.

   The McLaren team frantically changes the tyres. Four men with

   air guns, two men with rapid-duty jacks.

   ALASTAIR CALDWELL appears, talks to JAMES..

                         CALDWELL

               See? I told you to go on slicks!! You

               didn't take my advice...

                         JAMES

               Shut up! Where's Niki?

                         CALDWELL

               Behind you! He made the same mistake!

   JAMES looks in his mirror to see NIKI's red helmet behind him

   in the pits, then...

   "Thump", new (slick) tyres hit the tarmac. JAMES gets the

   signal, `Clear!'

                         CALDWELL

               Go! Go!! Go!!

   JAMES's foot hits the floor. He roars out, with new tyres,

   leaving NIKI behind him in the pits...

146 EXT. NUBURGRING - DAY                                          146

   JAMES gives it everything he's got. Tearing through the gears,

   breaking as late as he can, engine screaming.

   The world flies past in a blur. The steering wheel shakes. The

   car cannot be driven any harder. No thought for safety. No

   thought of failure..

   Failure is unimaginable. Unconscionable.

   He turns into the final straight, then stops when he sees

   something ahead.

   Flags. Red flags. RACE MARSHALLS. Something has clearly

   happened. An accident..

   The race is being stopped. JAMES brakes, slowing down. He

   pulls level with a uniformed MARSHALL..

                              JAMES

                 What's up?

                           MARSHALL

                 Accident. Bad one.

                              JAMES

   NIKI's POV: a continuation of the opening scene. Burning smoke

   fills NIKI's helmet, burning his lungs. He cries out in agony.

                           NIKI

                 AAAAARRRRGHGHGGHGH!!!!

   We can just make out the barely recognizable figures of the

   other DRIVERS rushing towards him, as their hands get burnt in

   the flames as they try unsuccessfully to undo his seatbelt...

   We notice it is the same DRIVERS that were critical of NIKI in

   the driver's meeting. HARALD ERTL, BRETT LUNGER, ARTURO

   MERZARIO, GUY EDWARDS...

   Fire extinguishers blast at the car. Covering NIKI's helmet.

   Filling his lungs with chemicals, along with the smoke and

   fumes, blurring his vision, as he screams horribly..

   The sound of panicked TV COMMENTARY in different languages.

   Screaming voices. Panicked reactions.

   Then sound fades. As NIKI blacks out - losing consciousness.

                                                        FADE TO BLACK:

   NIKI's POV: the door to a helicopter opens, as it arrives at

   Mannheim University Hospital...

   The sound of shouting voices. Hospital STAFF pull reach

   towards NIKI, pull his stretcher out.

   NIKI's internal voice groans: cries out at the pain.

                         NIKI (V/O)

               Some things are better not remembered.

150 INT. MANNHEIM UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - DAY                        150

   "Crash", doors burst open and NIKI is rushed into emergency.

   Neon ceiling lights pass overhead...

   The sound of difficult breathing.

   His stretcher is surrounded by DOCTORS, talking urgently,

   making quick assessments..

   NIKI's POV: fading in and out of consciousness.

   Bursts of concerned, urgent, overlapping dialogue among the

   German DOCTORS which NIKI can barely make out..

   Two narrow, barely open slits of light. NIKI's swollen eye-

   lids. NIKI's POV: barely making out MARLENE standing beside

   the senior burns specialist DOCTOR. NIKI hears voices...

                         DOCTOR

               It's not the burns to his face that

               are the danger. It's the burns to his

               lungs. His blood oxygen level is

               currently...

                         NURSE

               Which is not enough to maintain

               life...

   NIKI slips out of consciousness again. MARLENE is distraught,

   in tears.

   JAMES sits watching the news on TV in his apartment, while

   feeding his budgerigars, (the collection has grown)..

   He feels terrible. He goes to his desk, pulls out paper and

   pen...

   JAMES tries to find the right words, tries to write, tries to

   put his feelings on paper, but words in general, and letters

   in particular have never been his thing...

   JAMES scrunches up the pieces of paper, throws it away. The

   budgerigars, sensing his distress, flutter and peep..

   NIKI's P.O.V: feels someone touching his forehead and his

   hands with oil...and the sound of a WOMAN weeping...

                         PRIEST

               ...durch diese heilige Salbung helfe

               dir der Herr in seinem reichen

               Erbarmen, er stehe dir bei mit der

               Kraft des Heiligen Geistes...

   NIKI's eyes barely crack open, barely manage to focus to see

   an ELDERLY PRIEST is giving him the last rites in German..

   The sound of MARLENE crying somewhere in the room.

                         PRIEST

               Der Herr der dich von Sunden befreit,

               rette dich in seiner Gnade richte er

               dich auf...

   NIKI strains to move. A sense of excruciating pain.

   He fights to open his eyes, give an indication...ANY

   indication of the fact that he is hearing this, and is alive

   and able to fight for life...

   But to no avail. The PRIEST continues giving last rites.

   MARLENE continues to cry. The PRIEST touches NIKI's

   shoulder...

                         NIKI (V/O)

               I'm here! Can't you tell? I'm here!

   NIKI screams inside. Wanting to be heard. Wanting to give them

   a sign. He's OK. He's still there. But it's no use.

   NIKI blacks out again. The pain is too great.

                                                      FADE TO BLACK:

157 INT. CORRIDOR - HOSPITAL - DAY                                 157

   Sunrise: MARLENE has been sitting in the hospital all night

   supported by members of FAMILY and several FRIENDS.

   Niki's MOTHER and FATHER. CLAY REGAZZONI.

   Presently: the door to the intensive care unit opens and a

   DOCTOR comes out, beckoning her...

                           DOCTOR

                 Frau Lauda? Bitte kommen Sie! He's

                 awake! And just spoke!

   MARLENE scrambles to her feet...

                           MARLENE

                 What did he say?

                           DOCTOR

                 "Tell the Priest to fuck off! I'm

                 still alive!!"

   MARLENE covers her mouth, laughs nervously, already in tears.

   She and the DOCTOR rush into the intensive care unit.

158 EXT. INTENSIVE CARE UNIT - DAY                                 158

   Shooting through the window we see MARLENE approach NIKI's

   bed. She sees NIKI..

   And gasps. Trying to control her expression. Not give away to

   him how horrified she is.

   NIKI's face: is grotesque. His head has swollen to double it's

   size. The skin has burned off on his head, his eyes.

   MARLENE bravely composes herself. Then, without displaying the

   shock she feels - she goes over and kisses him.

   This time at Zandvoort, in the Netherlands..

   NIKI watches the race on television as DOCTORS put a vacuuum

   pump into his lungs. It's AGONY. JAMES leads, driving the

   perfect race...

                         YOUNG GERMAN DOCTOR

               We need to vacuum the lungs. Without

               this, they can't heal. But it will

               hurt.

   An unimaginably painful pump is forced down his burned lungs,

   to try to hoover out the impurities..

   COMMENTATORS ON TV: talk about how HUNT is catching up with

   LAUDA on points. It spurs NIKI on, through gritted teeth.

                         NIKI

               Aaarrrggghhhh...

   The chequered flag. JAMES crosses the line in first position.

   CAPTION: "RACE 12. HUNT WINS."

   The DOCTORS tell NIKI he's had enough vacuum treatment. He's

   had more than enough pain. But NIKI waves them aside...

                          NIKI

               Again!!

   The DOCTOR nods. The vacuum is turned on again.

   NIKI screams in agony. Eyes bulging. MARLENE and NIKI's family

   cannot bear to watch...

   champagne.

   NIKI continues screaming in pain, watching the Canadian GP on

   TV as..

   CAPTION: "RACE 13 CANADIAN GRAND PRIX. HUNT WINS AGAIN"

   For the first time, JAMES has taken the lead in points. NIKI

   stares at the TV: his expression changes.

   deeply distressed, cannot bring themselves to watch, as...

                           NIKI

                 Aaaaarrrrggghghhhhhh!!

   We WIDEN to reveal what NIKI is doing. What has caused these

   unbearable, bloodcurdling screams of agony..

                           NIKI

                 I know what you're all thinking...

   Now we see. With great difficulty NIKI has put his racing

   helmet on for the first time. Pressing into his open burn

   wounds...

                           NIKI

                 But if you love me - all of you - you

                 won't say a word.

   He is almost unconscious with pain. His legs are weak. But he

   has done it...

165 EXT. ITALIAN GRAND PRIX - MONZA - 12TH SEPT 1976 -DAY          165

   The Italian Grand Prix. TELEVISION COMMENTARY sets the scene.

   JAMES and the MCLAREN TEAM arrive in the pits to see a vast

   commotion going on elsewhere...

                           JAMES

                 What's going on?

                           CALDWELL

                 Jesus. It's Niki.

                 What about him?

                           CALDWELL

                 He's here! He's racing!

                           JAMES

                 What?? They said he was half-dead.

   JAMES stares. Shaken.

166 EXT. MONZA PITLANE/ FERRARI PITS - DAY                         166

   JAMES pushes through the pitlanes, until he reaches the

   crowded FERRARI pits. He sees a racer in the background. The

   name LAUDA on his overalls...

                           JAMES

                 Niki?

   NIKI turns round. JAMES sets eyes on him for the first time.

   JAMES reels, visibly horrified by his appearance. His bandages

   are blood stained. He has no hair. Looks grotesque..

   NIKI sees the horror in JAMES's face. Sees the shock. The

   horror. And recognizes in that moment, this is how it's going

   to be - this is how people will respond to him - forever.

                           NIKI

                 Wow. It's that bad, huh?

   JAMES opens his mouth. Tries to say something.

                           NIKI

                 In the hospital I told them to tell me

                 straight, no bullshit - how bad it

                 would be. My appearance. They said

                 with time it'd be fine. But it won't.

                 I can tell, seeing your reaction. I am

                 going to spend the rest of my life

                 with a face that frightens people.

   NIKI stares at JAMES, at his rival's beauty, his blonde,

   tanned perfection. His matinee idol, movie star looks...

                           NIKI

                 That's a tough one to get used to.

                            JAMES

                 I wrote you a letter at the time. To

                 apologize.

                           JAMES (contid)

                 The driver's meeting in Germany?

                 Before the race? I swayed the room.

                           NIKI

                 Yes. You did.

                           JAMES

                 That race should never have gone

                 ahead.

                           NIKI

                 No.

                           JAMES

                 So in some ways...I feel responsible

                 for what happened. I'm sorry.

                            NIKI

                 Trust me, watching you win those

                 points and all those races while I was

                 in hospital fighting for my life...you

                 were equally responsible for getting

                 me better.

   Ouch. That could have been meant generously. But in this case

   it wasn't. It was a cold slap in the face.

   NIKI turns and goes.

167 INT. MONZA GRAND PRIX - PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY                 167

   A packed press conference. The world's media. NIKI's accident

   and recovery (as a story) has reached way beyond F1 race fans.

   This is front page news around the globe..

   NIKI walks out onto the podium - all eyes staring at him - the

   sense of a ghoulish, voyeuristic freak show....

   NIKI sits on the podium, in front of microphones, flanked on

   both sides by FERRARI drivers and top brass. But no one wants

   to talk to them. Everyone's here to talk to NIKI..

                           JAPANESE JOURNALIST

                 How are you feeling, Niki?

                           NIKI

                 Fine.

                           AMERICAN JOURNALIST

                 Can you confirm for us exactly which

                 procedures you have had? And the

                 expectations for your recovery?

167 CONTINUED:                                                    167

                           NIKI

                 Sure. I had a skin graft operation

                 where they put half my right thigh in

                 my face. It doesn't look too good but

                 one unexpected advantage is it's

                 impossible to perspire through a skin

                 graft, so sweat will never run in my

                 eyes again - which is good for a

                 driver.

   Laughter. At the back of the hall, JAMES HUNT creeps in,

   (unseen by anyone, disguised in a hat), to listen.

                           BRAZILIAN JOURNALIST

                 When they heard about your condition,

                 Ferrari immediately hired another

                 driver, Carlos Reutemann.

                           NIKI

                 Ja. Before even my first operation.

                           JAPANESE JOURNALIST

                 Is he your replacement now?

                           NIKI

                 No. Just another team-mate. Keen to

                 make an impression. So let's see where

                 Mr. Reutemann finishes today.

   Laughter.

                           JAPANESE JOURNALIST

                 James Hunt and McLaren have caught up

                 a lot while you were away.

                           NIKI

                 Yes.

                     (a beat)

                 Is there a question now? Or are you

                 just trying to piss me off?

   Laughter.

                           JAPANESE JOURNALIST

                 You think you can still win?

                           NIKI

                 Of course. I have the better car. I'm

                 the better driver. But he's a clever

                 guy and has used the time well while I

                 was lying half-dead in hospital to win

                 some points..

   Laughter.

                         NIKI

               She said, "Sweetie, you don't need a

               face to drive. Only a right foot."

   Laughter.

                         BRITISH JOURNALIST

               I'm being serious. Do you really think

               your marriage can survive? With the

               way you look now?

   Silence. NIKI squints into the lights..

                         NIKI

               And I'm being serious, too. Which

               asshole said this? Jesus..

   No one moves. NIKI, disgusted, rips off his microphone..

                         NIKI

               Fuck you. Press conference over.

   NIKI walks out. The Press Conference breaks up...

   JAMES sees the REPORTER who asked the question, laughing with

   his friends. JAMES watches as the REPORTER leaves...

168 INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE PRESS CONFERENCE - SAME TIME             168

   JAMES goes after the REPORTER, and calls him..

               Hey..!

   The REPORTER turns, recognizes JAMES..

               I've got something for you on that

               last question...

   The BRITISH JOURNALIST smiles, "Great, thanks James!" Pulls

   out a tape recorder. JAMES takes him to one side, then...

   "WHACK, WHACK, WHACK" - JAMES punches his lights out, then

   takes the tape recorder, stuffs it into the JOURNALISTS mouth.

                         JAMES

               Now go home to your wife and ask her

               how YOU look!!

169 EXT. STARTING GRID - MONZA - DAY                               169

   JAMES walks out to his car. TV CREWS. Banks of PHOTOGRAPHERS.

   Commentators talk in different languages.

   Everyone talking about NIKI's comeback.

   NIKI is in his car. The MECHANICS are talking to him in

   Italian...

   But NIKI hears nothing. He looks at the steering wheel, the

   shell of the car, the gear stick. And then we see..

   His hands are shaking violently. He's utterly terrified.

   The light turns green. They're off!

   Other cars (including JAMES's), roar forward. But NIKI is

   frozen.

170 EXT. TRACK - DAY                                               170

   NIKI's mind is a mess - terrified - he starts slowly...finding

   his courage..

   COMMENTATORS point out it's madness. It was clearly too soon.

   Ferrari were right to hire a replacement. NIKI is a wreck..

   NIKI suffers terrible flashbacks from his accident...

   NIKI shakes himself out...gradually building up speed -

   ignoring the cars overtaking him all around him...

   NIKI begins to accelerate. Gently at first. Then a bit more.

   Trusting himself. Gaining confidence..

   Blocking out further flashbacks...

   What's this? Maybe there's life in him yet...

   NIKI changes gears smoothly. He begins to overtake. The old

   feelings come back..

   overtake the back-markers...

   An incredible sequence. As NIKI gains more confidence, more

   speed, and begins to work his way through the field..

   COMMENTATORS now buzzing with excitement. This is incredible,

   as NIKI overtakes first CARLOS REUTEMANN, the driver hired to

   replace him, then others, working his way through the field...

170EINT. JAMES'S CAR - SAME TIME                                 170E

   JAMES sees NIKI coming up behind him. Cannot believe his eyes.

   JAMES move to block NIKI's path...

   NIKI attacks fearlessly. Despite terrible pain. NIKI moves to

   overtake JAMES.

   Utterly intimidated by NIKI's bravery, JAMES panics, and loses

   control of the car. He spins out..

   COMMENTATORS cannot believe their eyes. HUNT's blown it!

   LAUDA's overtaken him!

   It's a miracle. It defies belief. As NIKI crosses the line....

   Television cameras and press photographers assemble at the

   race track for the biggest sporting event of the year...

174 INT. JAMES'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                                174

   JAMES sits alone in his hotel suite. Speaking to an old,

   trusted friend at the other end...

                           JAMES (ON PHONE)

                 The man was in a coma. His doctors

                 pronounced him dead!! Then he comes

                 back and does THAT???

                                                                       90

               What did you expect? That Niki would

               give you the championship lying down?

               Of course not. He's a fighter. He's

               going to come at you with everything

               he's got. But you can do this. As a

               driver, you're his equal - better,

               maybe. And God knows you're quick and

               brave enough. You just..

                         JAMES (ON PHONE)

               What?

                         BUBBLES (ON PHONE)

               Need to find the respect for yourself

               to close out when it really matters.

               You don't much like yourself, James -

               that's the problem, therefore don't

               believe you deserve it.

174BINT. JAMES'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                             174B

   A knock at JAMES's hotel room door..

                         JAMES

               I've got to go.

   JAMES hangs up, and goes to the door. He snaps it open to

   reveal..

   Two gorgeous-looking BOAC Stewardesses standing outside. Smart

   blue blazers, short skirts, white gloves, blue caps..

                         STEWARDESS

               Hi. We've come for the party?

                         JAMES

               What party?

                          STEWARDESS

               The party we were told was going on in

               room 2109.

   Sure enough: on JAMES's door, the number 2109.

                         JAMES

               Who sent you here?

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                           STEWARDESS

                 A man. On the phone. He didn't give

                 his name.

                           JAMES

                 This man. Did he speak with an accent?

                           STEWARDESS

                 Yes. German accent.

   JAMES can't believe it. NIKI.

                           JAMES

                 I'm afraid it was a joke..

                           STEWARDESS

                     (liking the look of JAMES)

                 Awwww. Pity.

                           JAMES

                 Sorry, ladies. Any other time. Not

                 tonight.

   JAMES closes the door. Goes back into his hotel room. Then,

   after a moment...

   He snaps open the door. The STEWARDESSES are about to

   disappear into the elevator...

                           JAMES

                 Wait..!

   ominously dark over Tokyo. Thick, black clouds.

   It's raining heavily...

   NIKI wakes up and looks out of the window. Sees the heavy rain

   which is falling outside...

   His expression changes.

177 INT. JAMES'S BEDROOM - HOTEL - DAY                             177

   JAMES wakes up. Flinches. JAMES looks around, bleary-eyed.

   Hungover.

   He's in a room that looks like a bomb has hit it.

   The two STEWARDESSES are still asleep in the bed beside him.

   Uniforms discarded on the floor.

   Memories are now flooding back. Jesus, what was he THINKING?

   JAMES leaps out of bed.

178 INT. NIKI'S ROOM - HOTEL - DAY                                 178

   NIKI is being massaged by WILLI DUNGL in his hotel room in

   preparation for the race.

   NIKI continues to stare out of the window. They speak in

   German. We see sub-titles..

                           NIKI

                 Can't see the mountain.

                           DUNGL

                 So?

                            NIKI

                 The locals here believe if you can see

                 the mountain in the morning, it brings

                 good luck.

   NIKI's POV: the view. Nothing but mist, dark skies and rain.

180 EXT. JAPANESE GRAND PRIX - FUJI SPEEDWAY - 24TH OCT 1976 -DAY 180

   Inside the race track: puddles everywhere. The rain continues

   to fall. The circuit is covered in water...

   DRIVERS and the TEAMS arrive at the race track. JAMES and

   TEDDY MAYER and ALASTAIR CALDWELL among them...

   SPECTATORS are huddled under umbrellas. TV CREWS struggle to

   keep expensive equipment dry...

   An American VOICE comes over the tannoy...

                           TANNOY

                 All drivers to the control tower,

                 please. Immediately.

   JAMES looks at CALDWELL...

   A driver's meeting has been called. All the DRIVERS are in a

   small room, arguing and remonstrating with FIA OFFICIALS and

   blazer-wearing POWERS THAT BE...

   A Japanese official, (AKIYAMA), is trying to keep the peace...

                         AKIYAMA

               One at a time! Gentlemen, please!

   Local JAPANESE DRIVERS are complaining in Japanese, (we see

   sub-titles)...

                         TAKAHARA

               You can't send us out in that! It's a

               death sentence!

                         HASEMI

               You have to postpone the race!

181AINT. CONTROL TOWER - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE - SAME TIME             181A

   JAMES, MAYER and CALDWELL arrive in a corridor outside the

   meeting room...

                         MAYER

               Niki's talking to them about

               cancelling the race.

   JAMES's POV: he can see NIKI, his wounds horribly visible,

   remonstrating with the JAPANESE OFFICIAL about the dangerous

   track conditions...

   JAMES turns to TEDDY and ALASTAIR...

                         JAMES

               I don't want any part of this. I'm not

               going to be responsible for turning

               the room again.

                         CALDWELL

               But you have no option. You HAVE to

               race, James. It's your only shot. If

               you don't, Niki wins..

                         JAMES

               I'm not voting against Niki

               again....or forcing fellow drivers to

               risk their lives. Sorry. World

               Championship or not...

   JAMES raises his hands and walks off. CALDWELL shouts after

   him, "James, wait..!" Then MAYER reassures CALDWELL...

                 Don't worry, this race is going ahead.

                 The TV rights have been sold all

                 around the world.

   MAYER can see that a vote is taking place in the room. Many of

   the drivers have their hands in the air, voting...

   The JAPANESE OFFICIAL is struggling to keep order in the room.

                           MAYER

                 The drivers can vote all they like.

   A round of applause in the room, as the DRIVERS vote to cancel

   the race. But unseen by the DRIVERS..

   The FIA OFFICIALS, TV NETWORK EXECUTIVES, and the blazered

   POWERS THAT BE are in dark, conspiratorial discussion..

   ...making the decision that the race goes ahead.

182 ARCHIVE TELEVISION FOOTAGE                                     182

   In the pits alongside JAMES...

   A series of shots of the other DRIVERS...being sent out like

   lambs to the slaughter...

   Visibly terrified, mouthing prayers, smoking last cigarettes,

   meditating, crossing themselves, hands shaking..

   Among them the JAPANESE DRIVERS. All laughter gone now.

   Realizing what they've got into. Risking their lives.

   Finally we come to rest on NIKI. Strangely calm.

   NIKI puts on his balaclava over his still-raw wounds, wincing

   with pain as he puts on his helmet..

                                                                        95

   don't get soaked in the water pooling deep on the track.

186 EXT. JAPANESE GP - STARTING GRID - DAY                        186

   JAMES lowers himself into a car with puddles on the seat. He

   straps himself in.

   ALISTAIR CALDWELL approaches with a power-drill. Leans towards

   JAMES, with the screaming drill...

                         CALDWELL

               Keep still...

                         JAMES

               What are you doing???

   `ZZZZ", "ZZZZ", "ZZZZ", CALDWELL drill holes in JAMES's visor.

                         CALDWELL

               To let the condensation out.

                         JAMES

               But it will also let the water in.

                         CALDWELL

               Not if you're leading.

   CALDWELL stares at JAMES...

                         CALDWELL

               Trust me. This race is all about the

               start. Whoever's in front will see

               everything. Whoever's second...

   CALDWELL gestures, "Nothing"..

                            CALDWELL

               Good luck.

   They shake hands. JAMES starts the engine with a roar.

   NIKI's engine replies with a loud roar. He looks over at

   JAMES. JAMES turns to face NIKI..

   ALL SOUND GOES SILENT...

   ...as JAMES and NIKI stare at one another. All around them,

   the world slows down. Comes to a standstill.

   A connection between them. Unspoken realization of where they

   have both got to. What this moment means. For them both..

   It's what they have been waiting for. Working towards. All

   this time.

   NIKI raises his hand. In a gesture only JAMES sees. JAMES

   raises his in return. A private salute.

   Chivalric. From a bygone era. And in that moment, enemies

   become brothers. Two men. Risking their lives.

   THE TEN SECOND FLAG IS RAISED..

   The moment's truce is broken. They return to the task at hand.

   THE FLAG DROPS. THEY'RE OFF.

   JAMES's spray makes it impossible for NIKI to see. NIKI can't

   blink his eyes...it's agony.

   Half-blind, NIKI tries to overtake. Gives it everything he's

   got, breaking as late as he can, tearing through the gears...

   For NIKI the world flies past in a near-blind blur. The

   steering wheel shakes. The car cannot be driven any harder.

   But the visibility is terrible. The spray tears into his

   scarred eyes. He is unable to see anything but...

   MARLENE's beautiful face: staring at him. Smiling tenderly.

   Kissing him tenderly.

   CALDWELL and TEDDY MAYER watch in horror from the pits and on

   TV. They can see the shaking car..

               Hunt's car has problems...it's

               shaking...the Englishman is definitely

               getting slower...

               ...with just a few laps to go, McLaren

               are calling for Hunt to come into the

               pits to change tyres...

   JAMES's car roars past the pits, refusing to stop...

                         COMMENTATOR

               But Hunt is refusing! Simply ignoring

               his team's orders...! He's made the

               calculation that he can still hold

               onto the lead...!

   Suddenly, a Ferrari in JAMES's wing mirror. Unmistakably, even

   in the spray, he can see the distinctive RED HELMET...

   It's NIKI. JAMES's blood runs cold...

                         JAMES

               No! No! NO!!!!

   JAMES tries to fend NIKI off. Swerves this way and that. But

   his wounded car is now running at seventy per cent at best...

   ...and disaster!!! NIKI OVERTAKES HIM...

   JAMES screams in agony and frustration. He's lost it! And has

   no one to blame but himself! His own arrogance. And

   stubbornness. NIKI's overtaken him!

   THE CHEQUERED FLAG.

   JAMES roars past. Has finished in third place. But that is no

   consolation. NIKI has beaten him. As far as he's concerned..

   JAMES has lost. Lost everything.

200 EXT. PITS - DAY                                                200

   JAMES's car arrives in the pits. In a fury. At himself. For

   refusing to listen. What a disgrace. What shame. What a fool.

   But he is engulfed. JAMES gets out of his car, raging...

                            JAMES

               I'm sorry!

   But TEDDY MAYER is celebrating wildly. ALASTAIR CALDWELL, too.

   The world's media descends on JAMES...

                         MAYER

                 overtook me!! I saw it!! A Ferrari

                 with a red helmet..

                           MAYER

                 That wasn't Niki. That was Regazzoni.

                             JAMES

                 What???

                           MAYER

                 Niki withdrew. Said it was too

                 dangerous, refused to drive!!

                     (gestures)

                 You're Champion of the World, kiddo!

   TEDDY MAYER takes JAMES's number `11' from the side of his

   car, and tears it in two, leaving number `1'.

   JAMES's face: as he realizes. Then explodes with happiness.

   Then turns the TV off. And follows BURTON out.

   Across the race-track, the sound of helicopter blades turning.

   JAMES looks over to see...

   NIKI in the helicopter with MARLENE and a PILOT. NIKI, now the

   ex-World Champion, looks over to see a triumphant JAMES

   surrounded by press, McLaren colleagues, etc

                         MARLENE

               Are you OK?

   NIKI turns, takes MARLENE's hand as he answers.

                         NIKI

               Fine. It's just one race.

   The helicopter lifts into the air, and flies off...

   turns to see...

   ...the world's press begins to descend on him, and the biggest

   party of JAMES HUNT's life is about to begin..

   In the background, the two JAPANESE DRIVERS are giving

   interviews again. They didn't just survive, MASAHIRO HASEMI

   got the fastest lap of the race, and NORITAKE TAKAHARA came

   9th...

   And at that moment, magically, the sun breaks through, and the

   snowy peak of Mount Fuji is finally revealed.

   We're on the runway of an airport in Northern Italy.

   CAPTION: "THREE MONTHS LATER"

   A stretch limousine pulls up on the tarmac.

   A still-drunk JAMES HUNT and several good-looking WOMEN, rowdy

   FRIENDS (and hangers-on) spill out of the limo...

   They cross the tarmac towards their waiting private jet,

   passing other jets, when JAMES stops.

   He's seen something that has caught his eye.

   JAMES sends his FRIENDS on ahead to their waiting jet, and

   walks over to a small private jet, (a Learjet 35)...

                           JAMES

                 I heard you were spending more and

                 more time in one of these...

   A hunched PILOT doing final checks. The figure turns. It's

   NIKI. His wounds have healed a little, but it's still a

   painful sight...

                           NIKI

                 Do you fly?

                           JAMES

                 No.

                           NIKI

                 You should try it. If something goes

                 wrong up there, you're on the edge,

                 but have to stay within the rules.

                 Stick to regulations. Suppress the

                 ego. It's good discipline for the

                 racing.

                           JAMES

                 And there I was thinking you were

                 about to wax lyrical about the romance

                 of flight. I should have known better.

                           NIKI

                 What brings you here?

   JAMES indicates his rowdy, cool-looking friends..

                           JAMES

                 A friend's wedding. At least I think

                 it was a wedding. Might have been a

                 birthday. All a bit of a blur. How

                 about you? Been at Fiorano?

                           NIKI

                 Pre-season testing.

                           JAMES

                 Already? In February? You're

                 relentless.

                              NIKI

                 Thank you.

                           JAMES

                 I'm not sure I meant it as a

                 compliment.

                           NIKI

                 But it is one. Relentlessness is good.

                 Means you're a fighter. That you never

                 give up. Behind my back I know some of

                 you guys call me `The Rat.' Because I

                 look like one. It's meant as an

                 insult. But I don't mind it. Rats are

                 ugly, sure. And no one likes them. But

                 they're intelligent. With a strong

                 survival instinct.

   JAMES can't help smiling. That's NIKI.

                           NIKI

                 So when do you start testing? Next

                 week?

                           JAMES

                 Are you mad? I didn't just win the

                 biggest thing of my life so I could

                 get right back to work.

                           NIKI

                 Why? You need to. To prove to all the

                 people who will always say you only

                 won it because...

                           JAMES

                 Because what...? Because of your

                 accident? Is that other people, Niki?

                 Or you? I won. On the all important

                 day when it came down to it, we raced

                 on equal terms in equally good cars.

               You bottled and I had the guts to see

               it through.

                         NIKI

               It's true. You won that race. And

               believe me if I had to lose that title

               to anyone, I'm happy it was you. But

               that doesn't change the fact you have

               to win again.

                         JAMES

               Why?

                         NIKI

               Because that's what it means to be a

               winner, no? It's a permanent

               condition. Never stops or goes away.

               It stays with you always.

                         JAMES

               That's winning? Sounds like losing to

               me. Some of life needs to be for

               pleasure, Niki. What's the use of

               having a million cups and medals if

               you never have any fun? How is that

               winning?

   The plane load of JAMES's friends call out..."C'mon, James!"

                         NIKI

               You're right. I could learn from you.

               In hospital the toughest part of my

               treatment was the vacuum. Pumping the

               shit out of my lungs. It was agony.

               While doing it, I was watching

               television...you winning all those

               races...and I was cursing you.. "That

               bastard, Hunt", I would shout, "I hate

               that guy." one day the doctor said,

               "Mr. Lauda, may I offer one piece of

               advice? Stop thinking of it as a curse

               to have been given an enemy in life.

               It can be a blessing, too." I said,

               "Who are you, Confucius?" He said, "A

               wise man gets more from his enemies

               than a fool from his friends." And you

               know, he's right. Look at us. We were

               a pair of kids when we first met.

               Hotheaded jerks in Formula 3. Headed

               nowhere. Now we're both Champions of

               the world. Not bad.

                         JAMES

               No, not bad.

               So don't let me down now. I need you

               busting my balls. Get back to work.

                         JAMES

               I will, Niki. But I intend to enjoy

               myself first. And so should you. You

               think you can?

   NIKI stares. A blank look..

                         JAMES

               See you on race day, Champ.

                         NIKI

               You will. Champ.

   JAMES goes. NIKI watches him, pulled into his plane by his

   laughing, cool FRIENDS. An unmistakable flicker of envy in his

   eyes.

   Then NIKI turns, alone, and resumes his safety checks.
