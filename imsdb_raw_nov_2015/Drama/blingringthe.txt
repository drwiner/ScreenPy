1   EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS MANSION - NIGHT                             1

    A Toyota parks and five teenagers get out and walk towards

    us, down a quiet residential street in the Hollywood Hills.

    One of them, a slightly drunk girl in a pale blue Juicy sweat

    suit stumbles.

                        DRUNK GIRL (NICKI)

                        (laughing)

              Shit.

                        GIRL 1 (REBECCA)

              C'mon. Hurry up.

    They come to a gated home. A girl that seems to be the

    leader, leans down and pulls on an unraveling part of the

    bottom of the chain link fence.

    She rolls under, and the others follow.

    A loud song kicks in as they put their sweatshirt hoods up in

    unison and turn around and walk backwards toward the house.

    They've done this before, they have it down.

    One checks under the mat of the front door, we follow them as

    they go around to the back, checking doors, and find a back

    window open.

    A guy gives Girl 1 a lift up, we see her bright underwear as

    she climbs inside into a laundry room.

    She runs around to open a side door for the rest, and they

    slip inside.

    Once inside, we follow REBECCA into a bedroom dressing area.

    She is the 17 yr-old Korean-American ring-leader, who is

    totally cool and composed.

    She looks over her shoulder at the others with a raised eye-

    brow.

                        REBECCA

              Let's go shopping!

    And she pulls open the closet door.

    CLOSE UP: grabbing Louis Vuitton bags.

    A drawer opens with a few Rolexes, that are scooped in to a

    Louis Vuitton duffle bag.

     An underwear drawer is opened, and picked through.

     A medicine cabinet is opened, a hand grabs bottles of

     prescription pills and dumps them in a bag.

     We see the other kids grabbing things and loading up bags.

     Rebecca puts on a hat she finds and looks at herself in a

     mirror posing, then gets back to it.

     Vuitton bags and other loot, as much as they can carry.

     The kids make their get-away:

     One girl, NICKI leans over and throws-up on their way out.

     They get into the Toyota and peel out.

     CLOSE UP: flashbulbs go off.

     Titles intercut with montage of Mug shots of attractive

     teenagers and news clips.

     We see a clip of black & white video surveillance of the

     kids' approach to the house walking backwards with hoods up.

     Pan across a row of Louboutin platform heels.

     We see the glittery view of Hollywood at night.

     CLOSE UP: a Facebook page of a party photo of Rebecca in the

     hat we saw her try on earlier.

     Pan across a pile of quilted Chanel bags.

     T.V. image of a starlet on the red carpet posing for

               expand as a spiritual human being.

               I see myself being like an Angelina

               Jolie, but even stronger, pushing

               even harder for the universe and

               peace and for the health of the

     Nicki and Sam, also pretty, slutty and 17, are waking up in a

     messy teenage bedroom.

     Clothes are all over the floor, a knot of duvet covers part

    Sam struggles to sit up, she's in a tight tank with bed head.

    She rolls her eyes.

                        SAM

              Oh my lord, you were so out of

              control last night.

                        NICKI

              What about you! You were all over

              that old guy, the manager...

    Sam laughs.

    Laurie, Nicki's mom, pretty ex-playboy model in her 40's in

    Juicy sweatpants and a tank top, gets breakfast ready.

    She opens a cabinet as she calls up to them. A little Yorkie

    nips at her heels.

                        LAURIE

              Girls! Time for your aderall! Let's

              go!

              Mom, they got home so late last

              night.

    Laurie with wide eyes and a forced calm voice answers her.

                         LAURIE

              That's none of your concern, I'll

              handle it.

    She calls up to them again.

                         LAURIE (CONT'D)

              Girls!

    Nicki and Sam wander down to breakfast, disheveled.

    Laurie tries to sound cheerful and in control.

              Let's have our morning prayer and

              then we'll meet in the living room

              at eight to start today's lesson on

    They join hands as Laurie enthusiastically leads them in her

    prayer.

              My chief aim in life is to

              greatest potential as a spiritual

              human being and contributor to the

              greater good for our planet and all

              those who live on it. I know that

              I have the ability to reach my aim

              in life, by persistent action and

              that the thoughts of my mind will

              reproduce themselves in outward

              physical reality.

              I will channel my energy towards my

              aim in life with graciousness and

              loving kindness to myself and

              others.

     Music is playing. Kids roam around with beers.

     Some kid is smoking out of a big bong, and singing along to a

     hip hop chorus.

     In a bedroom, Rebecca's older sister SARAH, 19, is selling

     little baggies of coke.

                         SARAH

               It's Fifty.

     She dangles the baggie like a treat.

     He takes it.

     There's a bulletin board of fashion tears and pictures of

     young starlets- Rachel Bilson, Lindsay Lohan, Audrina

     Patridge, some Victoria Secret models.

     Rebecca smokes a cigarette, while she and Marc flip through

     magazines. They look at pages of starlets in gowns on the red

     carpet.

     In the background, the TV is on with random celebrity culture

     playing

     There's a page of `Tweets of the Week' including a picture of

     Demi Moore posing in a bikini in her bathroom.

     Marc and Rebecca are on an affluent suburban street.

     They walk down the sidewalk casually under the street lights.

     Rebecca checks to see if a car's door is open. It's not, she

     goes on to another. She opens the door of a Lexus, and finds

     a small purse in door side pocket, she takes it.

                         REBECCA

               Sweet. C'mon.

     They keep walking and she tries another few cars, until she

     finds another open door. She looks around and finds some cash

     and a credit card.

     dressed in skimpy outfits and lots of lip gloss.

     Nicki, re-applies lip gloss, as Sam sends a text.

     The music is loud and they shout to speak to each other.

     (Note: There is constant texting and photo taking through

     patrol car drive by, and jump in some bushes.

     The patrol car stops and flashes a light around the bushes.

     Rebecca and Marc freeze in their hiding spot. Marc is

     freaking out, he thinks this is it for him. He tries to

     breath quietly. Rebecca calmly waits.

     Finally the flashing lights stop, and the car moves on.

     She's in a bikini in one, a sexy dress, a skimpy naughty

     The girls go through a woman's closet, trying on clothes,

     grabbing stuff.

     Marc opens a drawer in a closet, and finds seven Rolex

     watches and a thick stack of hundred dollar bills. He scoops

     them into a bag.

               decorate it, I might stay with him

               a while...here, hold this.

     She hands him the art off the wall, and rolls up a little rug

     on the floor.

                         MARC

               Are you fucking serious?

     Chloe straddles Ricky on his desk chair, making out with him.

     She holds out her arm and takes a picture on her phone. A

     Marc and the girls dance in slightly slow-motion.

     We hear dreamy, almost ominous tonal music as they dance

     instead of the club music. They sway in a dreamy trance,

     light gleaming around them, outlining their hair.

                         MARC (O.S.)

               When we went out, we got in

               everywhere and everyone loved

               us...and we had so many beautiful,

               gorgeous things.

     Marc is stashing a bunch of his loot in a basement.

     We see him take a last look at a Louis Vuitton suitcase

     packed full of luxury bags and designer fashion.

     Quilted Chanel bags in every color, Louboutin patent leather

     platform heels, Marc Jacobs crisp shirts.

     He touches them, and makes sure they're all tucked away

     carefully, before closing it up.

     We see there are several Louis Vuitton suitcases, he slides

     this one away next to them, and pulls a tarp over them in the

     corner and leaves them by some old Christmas decorations.

               I think this is like the 5th time.

                         ROB

               And she never noticed?

     Rob opens drawers, until he finds a box full of jewelry. He

     pulls out some diamond necklaces.

     They quickly head out a window onto the roof, as we hear

     someone entering the house.

     Over the empty room, with stuff all over the floor, we hear

     someone calling from entrance.

                         WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

               Hello? Hello?

     The kids scramble and run in the dark, until they find a

     street. We hear coyotes howling.

               Oh my fucking god.

     They climb up and onto a street. Someone walks by with their

     dog.

     The kids try to look casual, just walking down the street.

               Hi.

     They walk, with a few bags.

               You guys wait here, I'll get the

               car.

     She walks off, and the rest of them sit on the curb. Marc and

     Nicki smoke cigarettes.

                         MARC

               That was fucked up.

     She opens a big tote bag, and pulls out a little Chanel

     Mademoiselle quilted bag.

                         NICKI (CONT'D)

               Look a Mademoiselle bag! How cute

               That's so cute. Did you get me one?

     Rebecca pulls up in her car and they get in and drive off.

                         MARC (O.S.)

               I think the biggest problem was

               after the Audrina thing-nothing

               happened-it gave Rebecca that self-

               boost that, oh, this is okay. I can

               get away with this. And I think

               her projecting that onto me made me

               think that it was going to be okay.

     Rebecca keeps going to a keg. They get some beer in red

     plastic cups and look around.

     Chloe, wasted, comes up to them and they scream.

               We knew he was out of town through

               a movie, he's with Miranda Kerr in

               New York." We walked in, it was

               a minister, she's been a masseuse,

               she's an energy healer...My dad is

               a director of photography on T.V.

               And how is Sam related?

                         NICKI

               We've adopted her, we met in ballet

               class when we were little.

               I was friends with her mother--

                         NICKI

               Mom, this is my interview. I met

               her when my parents divorced. Now

               she lives with us, my mom's home

               schooled us all for a while.

               The philosophy of `The Secret',

               it's based on the law of

               attraction, but my great-

               grandmother and grandmother both

               studied this philosophy. It's man's

               relationship to the Divine, that's

               what energy science means.

               So, Sam was in your ballet class,

               did she have parents?

               She had a dysfunctional background,

               And I met her mom--

                         NICKI

               Can I talk please?! The reason we

               related so well is my dad is a

                I think that I'm a firm... I have a

                I'm not gonna speak about the case,

      Marc keeps walking, lawyers by his side, music takes over the

      his way through the mayhem.

      is pulled back severely. She's dressed in a dark suit and

      tinted glasses. They are flanked by lawyers. She speaks

      coldly to her in Korean, Rebecca answers her in English.

      She is seated next to Marc, but doesn't look at him. Marc

                We're here with Nicki Moore, who

                just served 30 days for her

                involvement in the Bling Ring, and

                shared a cell block with one of the

                victims- Lindsay Lohan. There were

                reports that Lindsay was crying,

                with you being next to her, did you

                actually hear any of this?

                          NICKI

                I could hear her crying the first

                day, which is hard when you're

                trying to be strong, I just tried

                to really keep to myself..., I just

                tried to get through the day , the

                days are so long you're woken up at

                5:30.

                And how'd she look?

               Were you nervous you were next to

               her because you were accused of

               being a part of that group that

               allegedly robbed her house.

                         NICKI

               Yeah, it was hard for me there were

               tabloids and on T.V.s in there

               people were watching the story and

               they were showing the surveillance

               video and stuff... and little do

               people know that when that video

               came out I was actually in contact

               with her manager to tell her who I

               believed the people were who robbed

               her house... and eventually when

               I'm able to tell my story people

               will know the truth.

                         INTERVIEWER

               So that's nerve wracking she could

               think you robbed her house.

                         NICKI

               She could've, but you

               know...yeah...Anyway, you can
