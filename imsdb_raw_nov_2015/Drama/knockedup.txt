          EXT. BEN'S HOUSE - DAY

          BEN STONE, 23, cute in a chunky Jewish guy sort of way, boxes one

          of his roommates, MARTIN. His other roommates, JAY and JASON fight

          with broom sticks. JONAH drinks beer on the couch spectating.

                         QUICK IMAGES:

           We see Ben and Jay fighting. At one point they fight with gloves

          which are on fire, balancing on a plank over a dirty pool.

           Ben now has a fishbowl filled with weed smoke over his head.

          There is a smoking joint in his mouth, making the bowl get

          cloudier and cloudier. He starts coughing hysterically and takes

          it off.

           A boom box is playing. The boys are now free style rapping. It

          is terrible but they are having a blast. Pot is being smoked.

          Beer is around.

          EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - A DIFFERENT DAY

          Ben and roommates ride a terrifying rollercoaster.

           Oh, I would, but I'm supposed to work

           out.

                          DEBBIE

           What?

                          PETE

           I got an appointment with a trainer. I

           can't cancel now, he'll charge me.

                          DEBBIE

           Well, you didn't tell me.

                          PETE

           Yeah I did. Last week, I told you.

                          DEBBIE

           You didn't tell me.

                          PETE

           I did. And then I wrote it on the

           calendar like you told me to.

                          DEBBIE

           No, you didn't tell me.

                          PETE

           I did tell you.

                          DEBBIE

           Well, you didn't, but what are we

           going to do? Because I have an

           appointment so you're taking the kids

           to school.

          Pete holds Charlotte in front of him.

                          DEBBIE (CONT'D)

           Don't use the baby to cover your

           tracks.

                          ALISON

           I can drive them. I'll drive them to

           school.

                          PETE

           Thank you very much.

                          DEBBIE

           Great. Good. You turned my sister into

           a limo driver.

                          ALISON

                          ALISON

           Why? I mean what did it say?

                          SADIE

           It didn't say anything. It just showed

           pictures of people lying dead on the

           floor and...blood everywhere and

           ugh...

                          ALISON

           Did you hit her?

                          SADIE

           I did not.

                          ALISON

           Make her happy.

                          (TO CHARLOTTE)

           It's okay.

                          SADIE

           It won't make her happy. She spilled

           all the marbles on the floor.

                          ALISON

           Well, give her her marbles back.

          which they work at, and a few TV sets which have movies running on

          them. Ben and his friends are holding a meeting. They each have a

          note pad and pen, and Jonah is on a computer. They smoke a joint

          and drink beers.

                          JASON

           All right? Now, are you sure you

           understand the terms of the bet?

           `Cause this is serious.

           KNOCKED UP - 5.

                          JASON

          Martin, listen. You don't shave your

          beard or cut your hair for one year,

          and if you can do that, I will pay

          your rent. But if you shave, then you

          have to pay all five of our rents.

                          MARTIN

          Thanks for the free money, bitch.

                          JONAH

          Hey, Martin, was it weird when you

          joined the Taliban, being American and

          everything like that? Like when you

          see a woman driving a car, do you just

          get pissed?

                          JASON

          Just watch your back, Serpico. You

          never know who your friends are.

                          MARTIN

          You guy can't make fun of the me the

          whole time.

                          JASON

          But, Martin, it's a competition. It's

          called "The Dirty Man Competition."

          We're gonna make fun of you until you

          shave the beard. That's the rules.

                          JAY

          That's the whole point. You're

          supposed to be tempted into shaving.

                          BEN

          Your face looks like Robin Williams'

          knuckles.

                          MARTIN

          You guys aren't allowed to make fun of

          me. It's not part of the rules.

                          JASON

          Martin, why didn't you just listen to

          me when I was explaining the rules?

          You just looked at me with that blank

          stare of yours. It was like talking to

          a wax statue.

                          BEN

          Okay, guys, are you ready? So... "Only

          I'm not going to be here. I got to do

          Great. We'll talk about the Middle

          East and maybe an idea of an exit

          strategy. Maybe she has a good pitch.

          Should I ask her about Korea? Maybe

          have her point it out to us on a

          globe? I don't understand the young

          talent in this town! It doesn't make

          any sense. I got four jobs. Hell, I'm

          more famous than half the people we

          talk to anyway! No one stands up. No

          one has the balls to sit them down and

          say, "Look, just cut the shit."But

          everybody works for `em. They're all

          on the payroll. They're all sucking

          the teat! Nobody sits `em down, eye-to-

          eye, one-on-one, and says... "Cut the

          shit." And all these stars just to

          fuck it up. That's what they do. They

          fuck my day up! And it pisses me off!

          And now I'm sweating.

                          ALISON

          Jill sit in the office.

                          JACK

           Thanks for coming in, Alison. Well, we

           wanted to talk to you today because we

           had a little debate on the conference

           call with New York about you.

                          ALISON

           You were talking about me?

                          JACK

           We were wondering aloud to one another

           whether or not you would be good for

           on-camera.

                          ALISON

           What'd you decide?

                          JILL

           They decided that they like you. And

           they would like to put you on camera.

                          ALISON

           Really?

                          JILL

           I know. I was so surprised, too.

           KNOCKED UP - 9.

                          ALISON

          Oh, my God. This is the best news

          ever. Thank you so much. This is

          great!

                          JACK

          Congratulations.

                          ALISON

          Thank you.

                          JACK

          I'll take that smile as a "Yes, I'll

          do it."

                          ALISON

          Absolutely. I'm so excited. Oh, my

          God.

                          JILL

          It's a lot of work. Can't wait to see

          what happens. It's going to be tough.

          Tough job.

                          JACK

          About the work, most immediately,

          there's going to be some things that

          you're going to be able to get that

          other people in the office don't get.

          One of them: Gym membership.

                          ALISON

          You want me to lose weight?

                          JACK

          I don't want you to lose weight.

                          JILL

          We can't legally ask you to do that.

                          JACK

          We didn't say lose weight.

                          JILL

          No.

                          JACK

          I might say "tighten."

                          ALISON

          "Tight."

                          JACK

          A little...tighter?

                          JILL

          Just like toned and smaller.

                          JACK

          Don't make everything smaller. I don't

          want to generalize that way. Tighter.

                          JILL

          We don't want you to lose weight. We

          just want you to be healthy.

           KNOCKED UP - 10.

                          ALISON

           Okay.

                          JILL

           You know, by, by eating less. We would

           just like it if you...go home and step

           on the scale and write down how much

           you weigh and subtract it by, like,

           twenty.

                          ALISON

           Twenty.

                          JILL

           And then weigh that much.

                          JACK

           Just remember, you've got it here,

           you've got it here, and everybody's

           going see you right there.

          INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

          Debbie and Alison hug. Pete is on the couch wearing headphones.

                          DEBBIE

           Yay! That's so exciting!

                          ALISON

           Yay!

                          DEBBIE

           Oh my god!

                          (TO PETE)

           Hey!

                          PETE

           Huh?

                          ALISON

           I got a promotion.

                          PETE

           Oh, congratulations!

                          ALISON

           Thank you.

                          PETE

           Hey, maybe you can get your own place

           now.

                          ALISON

           Oh, let's not get ahead of ourselves.

           Yay!

                          DEBBIE

           Let's go celebrate.

                          ALISON

           Okay, let's do it.

           KNOCKED UP - 11.

                          DEBBIE

           Pete'll watch the kids?

                          PETE

           Yeah! We can watch "Taxicab

           Confessions."

                          DEBBIE

           What are you going to do?

                          ALISON

           I don't know!

          Debbie and Alison SHRIEK.

                          DEBBIE

           I'm so excited.

                          ALISON

           Yay!

          INT. CAR - NIGHT

          Alison and Debbie drive to a nightclub.

                          DEBBIE

           I walked in on him masturbating one

           night.

                          ALISON

           Ooh! Did you get the deer-in-the-

           headlights look? Did he freeze or did

           he finish?

                          DEBBIE

           No, he tried to pretend like he wasn't

           doing anything under the covers.

                          ALISON

           Oh, no!

                          DEBBIE

           I buy these nice towels and he whacks

           off into them.

                          ALISON

           "Deb and Pete forever"

                          DEBBIE

           And once he does that into them once,

           they're never soft ever again.

          EXT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

          Alison and Debbie are walking over.

                          DEBBIE

           I can always tell if I'm looking good

           based on whether or not we get in.

          They reach the front. The Bouncer looks at them and waves them

          in.

           KNOCKED UP - 12.

                          BOUNCER

           Ladies?

                          ALISON

           Guess we're looking good.

                          DEBBIE

           If I didn't get in, I would have lost

           my shit.

          Ben and the guys are standing at the head of the line.

                          BEN

           What's going on man? How long you

           gonna make us wait out here, for

           Christ's sake?

                          JAY

           Come on! What the fuck!

          INT. NIGHTCLUB

          Ben sits with his friends, Jason, Jonah, Jay, and Martin.

                          BEN

           You know what movie I just saw again

           the other day which is fucking, like,

           mind-blowing, and I haven't seen it

           since it came out? "Munich."

                          JAY

           "Munich!"

                          JONAH

           Dude, "Munich" fuckin' rules.

                          JAY

           "Munich" is awesome!

                          BEN

           That movie was Eric Bana kicking

           fuckin' ass!

          They all agree.

                          BEN (CONT'D)

           Dude, every movie with Jews, we're the

           ones getting killed. "Munich" flips it

           on its ear. We cappin' motherfuckers.

                          JONAH

           Not only killing, but fuckin', like,

           takin' names.

                          BEN

           If any of us get laid tonight, it's

           because of Eric Bana in "Munich."

                          JONAH

           I agree with that.

                          JAY

           I agree.

           KNOCKED UP - 13.

                          BEN

           You know what is not helping us get

           laid? Is the shoe bomber, Richard

           Reid, over here at our table. I like

           your shoes.

                          JONAH

           How was "Burning Man" this year?

                          BEN

           Fuck you guys, I'm glad I'm not

           Jewish.

                          BEN (CONT'D)

           So are we.

                          MARTIN

           Fine. Screw it.

                          BEN

           You weren't "chosen" for a reason.

                          JAY

           Yeah. Ahh!

                          JASON

           Ohh!!!

          Meanwhile, Debbie and Alison head for the bar.

                          DEBBIE

           It's like everyone in here is twelve

           years old.

          Debbie SIGHS.

                          DEBBIE (CONT'D)

           Am I too old to be here?

                          ALISON

           What?

                          DEBBIE

           Am I too old to be here?

                          ALISON

           No, of course not.

                          DEBBIE

           Does it look weird that I'm here?

                          ALISON

           No, not at all.

                          DEBBIE

           Am I hotter than these little bitches?

                          ALISON

           Yes! You look amazing.

                          DEBBIE

           Guys in here would fuck me, right?

           KNOCKED UP - 14.

                          ALISON

           Yes.

                          DEBBIE

           That's weird to say, but, it makes me

           feel better.

                          ALISON

           You look hot.

                          DEBBIE

           I believe you.

                          ALISON

          Alison leaves for the bar.

          INT. NIGHTCLUB BAR - MOMENTS LATER

          Ben is already at the bar attempting to get the BARTENDER's

          attention.

           Yo, a beer over here, please? You're

           gonna be embarrassed when you realize

           I'm Wilmer Valderrama. God.

           (to the Bartender)

           Oh, Hey! Excuse me!

                          BEN

           He's literally ignoring this entire

           half of the bar. Don't even bother.

                          ALISON

           Yeah, awesome.

                          BEN

           A beer over here, please? He looked at

           us! Did you see that?

                          ALISON

           Yeah, that was rough.

                          BEN

           And if you can't get service, what am

           I gonna do, you know?

           Are you sure?

                          BEN

           I'm sure. I tried that once before at

           The Comedy Store and I got punched in

           the ear.

           opening, man, and I locked up. I just

           want to get shit-faced, though, you

           know? I'll just jerk it later. It's

           cool.

                          JASON

           Are you fuckin' crazy, man? She

           looks...smart. Who's that she's

           sitting with?

                          BEN

           It's her sister.

                          JASON

           Her sister?

                          BEN

           Yeah.

           doin' standing here man? Let's go.

           Come on, follow me.

                          (TO MARTIN)

           You stay here.

                          MARTIN

           Why?

                          JASON

           `Cause your face looks like a vagina.

           KNOCKED UP - 17.

          Ben and Jason head toward Alison and Debbie.

                          JASON

           Hey, which one's the sister?

          Jonah approaches Martin.

                          JONAH

           Hey, Crockett. You still partyin' with

           Tubbs these days?

                          MARTIN

           Come on, man. I'm getting it from all

           angles here. I don't like it anymore.

                          JONAH

           I know, I don't either. Was it weird

           when you changed your name from Cat

           Stevens to Yusuf Islam?

                          MARTIN

           Yeah, it was really awkward.

                          JONAH

           All right, man. I got to take off. See

           ya, "Scorsese on coke."

          Jay GROWLS loudly.

                          MARTIN

           What's that?

                          JAY

           Chewbacca. It's, you know, it's

           Chewie.

                          JAY

           Fuck.

                          MARTIN

           Fuckin' hilarious!

          Meanwhile, Ben and Jason get to Alison and Debbie's table.

           She's married.

                          DEBBIE

                          (TO ALISON)

           Why do you have to say that?

                          ALISON

           What?

                          JASON

           It's a shame. You're beautiful.

                          DEBBIE

           Thank you.

                          ALISON

           She has two kids, too.

                          DEBBIE

           Shut up!

                          ALISON

           What? It's nothing to be ashamed of.

                          BEN

           You think that's gonna stop him from

           hitting on her? It's not, at all.

                          JASON

           I love kids.

                          DEBBIE

           Really?

           Hello?

           Cool phone.

                          ALISON

           Yeah, she's got a really cool phone.

                          DEBBIE

           (into the phone)

           What? Is it a rash or is it the

           chicken pox? I don't know! Google it.

           Okay. All right, bye.

           (to Alison et al)

           I got to go. Sadie might have the

           chicken pox.

                          JASON

           I had the chicken pox three times. I

           have no immunity to it.

                          BEN

           We don't have the heart to tell him

           it's herpes.

                          JASON

           It's not herpes if it's everywhere.

                          DEBBIE

                          (TO ALISON)

           Are you coming?

           Um, uh, you know, I'm all dressed, so

           I'll just hang out.

                          DEBBIE

           Really?

                          ALISON

           Yeah, I'll take a cab home.

                          DEBBIE

           Be safe.

                          ALISON

           E!

           Ben and Alison dance, clearly pretty drunk now. We see Ben's

          friends in the background, also dancing. Ben pretends to throw

          dice while dancing.

                          JONAH

           Dude, I think he's doing the dice

           thing too much.

                          JAY

           That's really all he's got.

           Alison and Ben take another shot. Alison runs her fingers through

          Ben's hair.

                          ALISON

           I love your curly hair! It's so great.

           Do you, like, use product or anything?

           You're prettier than I am.

           Do you have a condom?

           I'll get it.

          Ben grabs his pants and takes out a condom.

                          BEN (CONT'D)

           Man.

          Ben struggles to put on the condom.

           Oh, God, just do it already!

                          BEN

           Okay.

          Ben throws the condom on the floor and rolls over onto Alison.

                          BEN (CONT'D)

           Good thing I'm drunk. This is lasting

           forever.

           schooled.

          INT. DINER - DAY

          Alison is in the booth. Ben emerges from the bathroom.

                          BEN

           Whew. I just yacked, something nasty.

           I feel way better, though. I think

           that's the secret. You just gotta

           puke. Did you puke?

                          ALISON

           No.

           KNOCKED UP - 25.

                          BEN

          You can. I won't think it's gross or

          anything.

                          ALISON

          I'm fine.

                          BEN

          Oh, okay.

                          ALISON

          I just need some coffee, so...

                          BEN

          You know, the best thing for a

          hangover's weed. Do you smoke? Do you

          smoke weed?

                          ALISON

          Not really.

                          BEN

          You don't?

                          ALISON

          No.

                          BEN

          At all?

                          ALISON

          Mm-mm.

                          BEN

          Like in the morning?

                          ALISON

          No, I just don't.

                          BEN

          It's the best medicine. `Cause it

          fixes everything. Jonah broke his

          elbow once. We just got high and, it

          still clicks, but, I mean, he's okay.

                          ALISON

          Right.

                          BEN

          Yeah. Last night was great...what I

          remember of it?

                          ALISON

          Right, yeah.

                          BEN

          Yeah.

                          ALISON

          We had a great time.

                          BEN

          Yeah. So what do you do?

           KNOCKED UP - 26.

                          ALISON

          I work at E!

                          BEN

          The television channel?

                          ALISON

          Uh-huh, remember?

                          BEN

          Wow.

                          ALISON

          We had, we had this conversation last

          night. I, I told you about my

          promotion and I was out celebrating

          it. No?

                          BEN

          I don't remember that at all.

                          ALISON

          I'm super excited about it. I'm

          actually doing my first on-air

          interview today.

                          BEN

          With who?

                          ALISON

          Matthew Fox.

                          BEN

          Matthew Fox from "Lost?"

                          ALISON

          Yeah.

                          BEN

          You know what's interesting about him?

                          ALISON

          What?

                          BEN

          Nothing. Will you tell him he's an

          asshole for me?

                          ALISON

          No.

                          BEN

          Someone needs to. Like who gives a

          shit?

                          ALISON

          I hope a lot of people actually

          because that's what my job entails, is

          making sure people care about what he

          has to say. I'm interviewing him.

                          BEN

          Maybe it's just me. Maybe I just don't

          give a shit. I'm just saying he

          deserves a beat down.

           KNOCKED UP - 27.

                          ALISON

          It's sort of embarrassing to ask at

          this point, but what do you do for

          work?

                          BEN

          Me and my roommates have

          started...we're starting an Internet

          website.

                          ALISON

          Oh, cool, what is it?

                          BEN

          I'll give you the virtual experience

          okay? How's that? You're at your

          computer. Who's an actress you like?

                          ALISON

          Mary Tyler Moore?

                          BEN

          No, that does not work at all. Let's

          say you love Meg Ryan.

                          ALISON

          I do.

                          BEN

          Great. Who doesn't? Let's say you like

          her so much, you want to know every

          movie where she shows her tits. And

          not just that, but how long into that

          movie she shows her tits. Come to our

          web page, exclusively, type in `Meg

          Ryan.' Bam! `In the Cut,' thirty-eight

          minutes in, forty-eight minutes in,

          like an hour and ten minutes in. She's

          like naked that whole fuckin' movie.

          She does full-frontal in that movie.

                          ALISON

                          (DISGUSTED)

          Wow.

                          BEN

          They should have called her Harry, not

          Sally.

                          ALISON

          Really.

                          BEN

          I'll show it to you. I'll show you Meg

          Ryan's bush.

                          ALISON

                          (EXASPERATED)

          Okay.

                          BEN

          Cool.

                          ALISON

          I actually need to get going, so.

           KNOCKED UP - 28.

                          BEN

           Awesome. Can I get your number?

          Alison is incredulous.

                          BEN (CONT'D)

           We had fun, right? We should hook up

           again.

                          ALISON

           I'm gonna give you my card because

           that'll be the best way...

                          BEN

           If you want to contact me, I don't

           have a cell right now because of

           payment complications, but you can

           email me at the web page, I check it.

           It's Ben at flesh of the stars, one

           word, dot com.

          Alison gets out of the booth. Ben gets up too.

                          BEN (CONT'D)

           So, awesome.

                          ALISON

           All right then. Nice to meet you.

          Ben puts his arms out for a hug. Alison complies. Ben kisses the

          air.

                          ALISON (CONT'D)

           Take care.

                          BEN

           Okay, uh, see ya.

          Alison exits the diner.

                          BEN (CONT'D)

           Bye!

                          (TO HIMSELF)

           That was fuckin' brutal. Yeah, that

           was brutal.

          INT. E ENTERTAINMENT TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY

          Alison is standing on stage with JAMES FRANCO.

                          ALISON

           Hi, I'm Alison Scott and we're here

           today with James Franco from "Spider

           Man."

                          ALISON (CONT'D)

           How are you?

                          JAMES FRANCO

           Great.

           KNOCKED UP - 29.

                          ALISON

           Thanks for coming.

                          JAMES FRANCO

           Of course.

                          ALISON

           Tell me, were you a big fan...

          Alison GULPS and appears uncomfortable.

                          ALISON (CONT'D)

           ...I'm sorry, let me take that again.

                          JAMES FRANCO

           Okay.

                          ALISON

           Tell me, were you a big fan of the

           comic books growing up?

                          JAMES FRANCO

           No, actually, I didn't read any of the

           comic books until I got the movie.

          Alison stares at the floor looking ill. She breathes heavily.

           JAMES FRANCO (cont'd)

           Are you okay?

                          ALISON

           Uh-huh. Yeah, just, what about the

           comic books? Keep talking.

                          JAMES FRANCO

           Like I said I really wasn't into them,

           but now that I did the research, I

           think they're pretty amazing.

          Alison runs offstage and VOMITS into a trash can. Repeatedly.

           JAMES FRANCO (cont'd)

           What the fuck?

          Alison continues to puke.

          INT. EDITING BAY

          Alison and her editor, BRENT, are watching the Franco/puking

          clips.

                          BRENT

           Is that the sound of you puking?

           JAMES FRANCO (ON TV MONITOR)

           If this is one of those fuckin' joke

           shows, I'm not into it.

                          BRENT

           We should put this on YouTube.

                          ALISON

           Shut up.

           KNOCKED UP - 30.

                          BRENT

           This is hilarious.

                          ALISON

           You're an asshole.

                          BRENT

           Look how sweaty you are. You look like

           Dom DeLuise.

                          ALISON

           I don't need to see it again. It's

           gonna make me throw up.

                          BRENT

           You look like Jabba the Hutt dying.

          Brent HISSES like Jabba the Hutt.

                          ALISON

           You're such an asshole.

                          BRENT

           I'm just jerking your chain. I'll fix

           this. No problem.

                          ALISON

           Yeah, maybe if you can just edit this

           out and we can re--

          Alison swallows hard.

                          ALISON (CONT'D)

           --we can reshoot my questions.

          Alison looks ill again.

                          BRENT

           What's up?

          Alison is frantically looking for a place to vomit.

           BRENT (CONT'D) (cont'd)

           Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, no. Over

           here. Not on the mixing board, not on

           the mixing board.

          Alison finds the trash and VOMITS.

                          BRENT (CONT'D)

           Are you okay?

                          ALISON

           Oh my god. Oh my god.

                          BRENT

           Are you sick?

                          ALISON

           I don't know.

                          BRENT

           What'd you eat?

           KNOCKED UP - 31.

                          ALISON

           I haven't eaten today yet.

                          BRENT

           You haven't eaten yet?

                          ALISON

           Do you have a napkin or something?

          Brent grabs a stray piece of paper.

                          BRENT

           Here, here. What do you have, like the

           flu?

                          ALISON

           I don't know.

                          BRENT

           God, I hope you're not pregnant.

                          ALISON

           It's impossible. You have to have sex

           to get pregnant.

          Alison reacts with a sad realization. Brent picks up the phone.

                          BRENT

           (into the phone)

           B.K. It's Brent Master Five. Alison

           just puked. Dude, that's what I said.

           She's probably pregnant, right?

                          ALISON

           Oh, shit.

                          BRENT

           (into the phone)

           How does she look right now? She looks

           like she just realized that she's

           pregnant.

          INT. DEBBIE AND PETE'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Debbie and Alison are sitting on the bed.

                          ALISON

           No, I can't be pregnant. Right? That

           was what, eight weeks ago?

                          DEBBIE

           Did you miss your period?

                          ALISON

           No. Wait. I don't know. Shit. I don't

           know. I can't remember. I was, I mean,

           I've been really stressed at work. I

           can't remember my last period.

                          DEBBIE

           Are you the lady who doesn't realize

           she's pregnant until she's sitting on

           the toilet and a kid pops out?

           KNOCKED UP - 32.

                          ALISON

           Can you not joke right now? Don't joke

           right now. This is really serious.

                          DEBBIE

           Did I meet him?

                          ALISON

           Yeah. You know, he was kind of like

           medium height, sort of...chubby.

           Blonde, curly hair. Remember?

                          DEBBIE

           With the man boobs.

                          ALISON

           Yes! Here, I have this thing of him on

           my phone.

          Alison takes out her phone to play a video.

           BEN (ON PHONE VIDEO)

           Hey! I live in your phone! This is the

           best night of my life! I gotta pee.

                          DEBBIE

           Oh god. How did this happen?

                          ALISON

           Oh, shit.

                          DEBBIE

           Well there's only one way to find out.

          INT. DRUG STORE

          Alison and Debbie run down the aisles looking for pregnancy tests.

           They're here! Here they are! Over

           here!

          Every test on the shelf is pulled into their basket.

                          ALISON

           Okay. "Positive Choice."

                          DEBBIE

           "Easy, One, Two, Three."

          They run toward the check out counter.

          INT. DEBBIE AND PETE'S HOUSE, BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          They dump all the tests on the floor. Alison sits on the toilet

          and rips one test open. She puts the applicator between her legs.

                          ALISON

           Here. Hurry up now. Come on.

          The test reads positive.

           KNOCKED UP - 33.

                          ALISON (CONT'D)

           Get more! Get me a few more!

                          DEBBIE

           Did you try the "Ova-Sure?"

          Alison furiously drinks some juice.

                          ALISON

           I'm dripping, I'm dripping. Wait.

          They check another test.

                          DEBBIE

           Good! A smiley face! Oh, I think

           that's bad.

                          ALISON

           How long does this one take?

                          DEBBIE

           These can't all be positive. Let me

           try one.

          Pete enters to see Debbie sitting on the toilet. Debbie urinates

          on the test and checks it.

                          ALISON

           God, you really had to pee.

          Debbie picks up a test. It's positive.

                          DEBBIE

           What is this? What the hell is this?

                          ALISON

           I think you picked up the wrong one.

                          DEBBIE

           Fuck. That scared me. That would suck.

          Alison glares at Debbie.

                          DEBBIE (CONT'D)

           I'm sorry. That scared me.

          EXT. DEBBIE AND PETE'S HOUSE, POOL - NIGHT

          Alison is on a chaise lounge. Debbie is sitting nearby.

                          ALISON

           It's gonna be fine. Right?

          Debbie contemplates.

           ALISON (CONT'D) (cont'd)

           Right?

                          DEBBIE

           Of course it will be fine. It's gonna

           be fine.

           KNOCKED UP - 34.

                          ALISON

           Shit.

                          DEBBIE

           You just need to call him.

                          ALISON

           Maybe I don't need to call him until

           after I see the doctor.

                          DEBBIE

           You need to call.

                          ALISON

           I don't want to call him. I don't need

           to call him.

                          DEBBIE

           You should call.

                          ALISON

           I can't call him anyway. He doesn't

           even have a phone. He didn't even have

           a number to give me.

                          DEBBIE

           He doesn't have a phone?

                          ALISON

           Said some kind of billing issue.

                          DEBBIE

           He can't afford a phone? Sadie has a

           phone.

                          ALISON

           Shit, you're right. I got to call. I

           don't know. I'm gonna have to look him

           up on his stupid website.

                          DEBBIE

           What kind of website does he have?

          INT. DEBBIE AND PETE'S HOUSE, OFFICE

          Debbie and Alison sit at the computer looking at Flesh Of the

          Stars.

                          DEBBIE

           He spelling "coming" wrong. Oh it's

           "cum." That's gross.

                          ALISON

           Just go to "Contact Us."

                          DEBBIE

           Ben?

           Yeah.

           You're sure?

           Yeah.

                          JONAH

           I could smoke weed every second of

           every day.

          Ben wears a gas mask attached to a bong.

                          BEN

           Hi, Ben, this is Alison. I don't know

           Oh, yeah, Alison. What's up?

           Let's meet up maybe tomorrow night?

           You wanna just grab some dinner?

                          BEN

           (into the phone)

           Why not? Meeting of minds sounds good.

           What do you say Geisha House,

           Hollywood, nine o'clock?

                          ALISON

           (into the phone)

           Sure. That's cool. Can we make it more

           like six, though? I'd like to keep it

           early.

                          BEN

           (into the phone)

           Six o'clock. Beat the rush. Yeah,

           leave more time for afterwards.

           Okay. I'll just meet you there, then,

           Sorry it took so long to get a table.

          You look very pretty, though.

                          ALISON

          Thanks. Yeah, I just thought, I don't

          know, I thought maybe it'd be cool to

          hang out a little bit and... We didn't

          really get to talk much last time so I

                         THOUGHT--

                          BEN

          That we didn't.

                          ALISON

          I thought maybe we'd just talk and get

          to know each other...better.

                          BEN

          Cool. Okay, I'll start. I'm Canadian.

          That's cool.

                          BEN

          From Vancouver. I live here illegally,

          actually. Don't tell anyone. But it

          works out in my advantage, ultimately,

          `cause I don't have to pay any taxes.

          So financially that's helpful `cause I

          don't have a lot of money. I'm not

          poor or anything but I eat a lot of

          spaghetti.

                          ALISON

          So the web page is it just something

          that you guys do for fun? Do you have

          a real job?

                          BEN

          Well, that is our job.

          We don't technically get money for the

          Right.

                          BEN

          And that really lasted me until now.

          It's been almost ten years. I have

          like nine hundred bucks left. So that

          should last me for I'm not a

          mathematician, but like another two

          years or some shit...I think.

                          ALISON

          Yeah. So, I have something I really

          need to tell you. It's kind of why I

          called you. Here it goes. I'm

          pregnant.

                          BEN

          Fuck off.

                          ALISON

          What?

                          BEN

          What?

                          ALISON

          I'm pregnant...?

          Yes!

                          BEN

          How the fuck could this happen?

                          ALISON

          I don't know. I thought you were

          wearing a condom.

          No.

                          ALISON

          What?

          Because you told me not to.

          What are you talking about?

                          BEN

          not to.

          I did not tell you not to wear a

          condom.

                          BEN

          Here's what happened, okay? I will

          give you a play-by-play of my memory.

          I almost had the condom on my dick. It

          was on the cusp and then you said,

          "Just do it, already."

                          ALISON

          I didn't mean do it without a condom.

          I mean "do it" like "hurry up," like

          "get fucking going!"

                          BEN

          Well, I assumed you were wearing a

          patch, or like a dental dam or one of

          those fuckin' butterfly clips or

          something like that.

                          ALISON

          What the hell is a dental dam?

                          BEN

          It's like Saran Wrap! It's disgusting,

          okay? But I thought you had one. Why

          the fuck didn't you stop me once we

          Oh, my God! I don't know! I couldn't

          tell that you didn't have one on!

          Obviously, I was drunk!

                          BEN

          Was your vagina drunk? Did you think

          it's the thinnest condom on earth I

          have on? I'm a fuckin' inventor? I

          made a dick-skin condom? He hollowed

          out a penis and put it on? What the

          fuck?!

                          ALISON

          You are unbelievable.

                          BEN

          Okay, you know what? Maybe, I've

          reacted unfavorably. So what happens

          now? I don't know how this works.

           I am going to the doctor next

           week...and I thought you could come

           with me to the gynecologist.

                          BEN

           So you haven't seen him, though?

           No.

                          BEN

           So you don't know if you're pregnant.

           Well, I'm not a hundred percent sure.

                          BEN

           So, what can I help you with today,

           Mister and Mrs. Stone?

                          ALISON

           I took a home pregnancy test and it

           said I was pregnant, so here we are.

           DR. PELLAGRINO

           Let's have a look. Legs up.

          Alison puts her legs up and leans back.

                          BEN

           Nice office.

           DR. PELLAGRINO

           Thank you.

          Dr. Pellagrino examines Allison's genital area.

           DR. PELLAGRINO(cont'd)

           Well, you do look a lot like your

           sister.

          Dr. Pellagrino picks up a long cone shaped device.

           DR. PELLAGRINO(cont'd)

           This is gonna be cold.

                          (TO BEN)

           And you're next. I'm just kidding.

          Dr. Pellagrino looks at Ben and shrugs like saying "this is just

          part of the job" as he puts the cone device inside Alison.

           DR. PELLAGRINO (CONT'D) (cont'd)

           There's the cervix. And the uterus.

           See that? That dark sac there, that's

           the amniotic sac. And right there, in

           the middle is the embryo. Do you see

           that flicker? You know what that is?

           That's the heartbeat. Yeah, it looks

           like you are pregnant. About eight or

           nine weeks, I'd say. Congratulations.

          Alison points to the monitor.

                          ALISON

           That, that's it?

           DR. PELLAGRINO

           Yep. Take good care of it. Now the fun

           part starts. Let me make a picture for

           ya, huh? That'll be fun.

          Alison begins to CRY.

           DR. PELLAGRINO (CONT'D) (cont'd)

           Well, I'll meet ya in my office. I'll

           give ya a little time alone, there.

           Why did we go to Costco and buy a

           year's supply of condoms if you

           weren't gonna use `em, man?

                          JONAH

           I can't believe you did this. You

           fucked everything up.

                          JASON

           Look, the real point is not to get

           yourself in this position. That's what

           you have to realize. You gotta know

           all the tricks. Like, for example, if

           a woman's on top, she can't get

           pregnant. It's just gravity.

                          JONAH

           Everyone knows that.

           I think it's awesome that you're gonna

           have a kid, man. Think of it like

           this. It's just an excuse to play with

           all your old toys again.

                          JONAH

           You know what I think you should do?

           Take care of it.

           Tell me you don't want him to get an

           "A word."

                          JONAH

           Yes, I do, and I won't say it for

           little Baby Ears over there, but it

           rhymes with shmish-mortion." I'm just

           saying -- hold on Jay, cover your ears

           -- you should get a "shmish-morshmion"

           are the "shmish-morshmion" clinic.

                          JAY

           Ben, you cannot let these monsters

           have any part of your child's life.

          Ben gets up and leaves the room.

           happen with your career? Or how, how

           are you gonna tell them?

                          ALISON

           Well, I'm not gonna tell them for a

           while. I have a while before I have to

           say anything.

                          BETTY

           How could you not tell them?

                          ALISON

           Well, they're not gonna know. I mean,

           I'm only gonna start to show when I'm

           like, I don't know, six months or

           something. Seven months.

           I cannot be supportive of this. This

           is a mistake. This is a big, big

           mistake. Now think about your

           stepsister. Now, you remember what

           happened with her? She had the same

           situation as you and she had it taken

           care of. And you know what? Now she

           No, this is not a disaster.

                          BEN

           It is, you know?

                          HARRIS

           An earthquake is a disaster. Your

           grandmother having Alzheimer's so bad

           she doesn't even know who the fuck I

           am, that's a disaster. This is a good

           What did you say?

           That's right, that's right.

           Right. If it grows in the ground, it's

           probably okay.

                          BEN

           I guess it worked. You told me not to

           smoke pot all those years. And then I

           found out you were smoking pot that

           whole time.

                          HARRIS

           Not the whole time. Just in the

           evenings and all day every weekend.

           Not that much.

                          BEN

           your plans, necessarily, and you just

           I'm okay right now. Thank you.

           You must be angry at the baby whenever

           it steals your food, huh? "Oh it's

           mine, not yours." But, you know...

           Because you're family, you got to

           share.

                          ALISON

           this shit.

                          JONAH

           What the fuck, man?! If I go in there

           and see fuckin' pubes sprinkled on the

           toiled seat, I'm gonna fuckin' lose my

           mind! Last time I went to the

           bathroom, Jay, I took a shit and my

           shit looked like a fuckin' stuffed

           animal!

                          JAY

           You're embarrassing me in company!

           The funny thing is I really had never

           even thought about having a baby.

                          BEN

           Yeah.

           If this hadn't happened, I don't think

           I would have wanted to have a baby

           for, like, I don't know, at least ten

           years.

                          BEN

           At least! God, honestly, I just got

           used to the notion that someone would

           even have sex with me. I didn't think

           this would happen.

           Get ready. This will be coming out of

           you in seven months. This is exactly

           what our baby will look like.

                          ALISON

           It's a beautiful picture, Ben.

                          BEN

           It is. It's not bad.

           (in a French accent)

           Hello, Mommy. Our baby's gonna be

           French Canadian. I like that.

           Well, you can't eat sushi. You can't

           smoke. You can't smoke marijuana. You

           can't smoke crack. And you can't jump

           on trampolines. This is basically a

           giant list of things you can't do.

                          ALISON

           It sounds thrilling.

           I'm gonna be sitting there on the

           It's not that.

           don't have to rush it.

           Yeah.

                          ALISON

           We should really just try to get to

           know each other and...give this a real

           shot. You know? We got ourselves into

           this situation. We kind of have to.

           He came from his house, drove over to

           down, and then, a hole goes in your

           body and there's blood everywhere,

           coming out of your head, and then you

           butt and you have to dig and you find

                          CHARLOTTE

           Feed the teddy bear.

                          BEN

           I feed your bear the grass? Know what

           your bear would also like to do with

           some grass? Smoke it.

          Allison and Debbie watch Ben and the kids from the patio.

                          ALISON

                          (TO DEBBIE)

           What do you think of him? He's funny,

           right?

          Ben throws the bear's bowl.

                          BEN

           Fetch. All right, bring it back.

                          DEBBIE

                          (TO ALISON)

           He's playing fetch with my kids. He's

           treating my kids like they're dogs.

                          ALISON

                          (TO DEBBIE)

           No's he not.

          Ben throws the bear this time.

           KNOCKED UP - 57.

                          BEN

           Go get it! Fetch!

                          DEBBIE

                          (TO ALISON)

           Plays fetch with the kids.

                          BEN

           All right!

                          ALISON

                          (TO DEBBIE)

           He's trying. He's making an effort.

                          CHARLOTTE

           I don't wanna play this anymore.

                          BEN

           Bring it back.

                          DEBBIE

                          (TO ALISON)

           He's overweight. Where does that end?

           How old is he?

                          ALISON

                          (TO DEBBIE)

           Twenty-three.

                          DEBBIE

                          (TO ALISON)

           Looks thirty-three. He can barely get

           in and out of that little house.

           Imagine how much bigger he's going to

           get.

          Ben tries to exit the playhouse but gets stuck a couple times.

                          DEBBIE (CONT'D)

           That means he has bad genes. Your kid

           is going to be overweight.

                          ALISON

           Shit.

                          BEN

           I'm gonna get you!

          Ben chases the girls on top of the trampoline.

                          BEN (CONT'D)

           I'm gonna get you! Whoa!

          Ben falls off the trampoline onto the grass. The kids love it.

                          ALISON

                          (TO DEBBIE)

           Just give him a break.

                          DEBBIE

                          (TO ALISON)

           Okay, I'll try.

          Ben and Pete sit while Charlotte and Sadie blow bubbles.

                          BEN

           They seem to love bubbles.

                          PETE

           They go ape-shit over bubbles.

                          BEN

           They're really going ape-shit.

                          PETE

           That's an incredible thing about a

           child. What's so great about bubbles?

                          BEN

           They float. You can pop them. I mean,

           I get it. I get it.

                          PETE

           I wish I liked anything as much as my

           kids like bubbles.

                          BEN

           That's sad.

                          PETE

           It's totally sad. Their smiling faces

           just point out your inability to enjoy

           anything.

                          BEN

           Am I going to be okay, man?

                          PETE

           Who knows? Is anybody okay? I'm not

           okay. You're asking the wrong guy.

           Just don't ask me to lend you any

           money, you know?

                          BEN

           Can I just have some?

                          PETE

           No.

          So?

                          BEN

          I can't ref the next games, by the

          way. I got to go meet gynecologists

          with Alison. She doesn't like her

          gynecologist.

                          JAY

          You think she likes you?

                          BEN

          She's trying to.

                          JAY

          She's entertaining the idea of liking

          you.

                          BEN

          Exactly. I'll take that.

                          JAY

          Wll, see she's bringing you to the

          gynechiatrist. She must like you.

                          BEN

          That's pretty good, I think.

                          JASON

          You know who I'd like to get pregnant

          is that Felicity Huffman, man. Ever

          since "Transamerica," I can't get her

          out of my mind.

                          BEN

          Guys, I hate to crack the whip, but

          it's kind of, uh, business meeting

          time. I need moolah. When do you think

          we can launch this site?

                          JAY

          Geez.

                          JONAH

          You can't rush this. You know what

          happens to these sites when they go up

          and they don't function well? They

          die.

                          BEN

          Seriously, guys, let's say I want to

          launch today. Let's start... let's use

          that as a jumping off point. Let's

          make this happen. What can we do?

                          JONAH

          Look, man, I didn't go to Yale so I

          could work twelve hours a day.

           KNOCKED UP - 60.

                          JASON

           I thought you went to Santa Monica

           City College.

                          JONAH

           I went where I went, Jason.

                          BEN

           I'm not asking you to work twelve

           hours a day. I mean, you guys watch

           movies without nudity in them.

                          JASON

           I'll tell you what, man. We could

           probably get it online in three

           months.

                          BEN

           Thank you. Yes! Three months.

                          JONAH

           Come on, Jason!

          Jason serves the ball and Jonah hits it as hard as he can to win

          the game.

                          JONAH (CONT'D)

           Fuck off!

                          JASON

           you're my doctor on the day and...

           I understand. We have three other

           doctors in the practice but I'm your

           I mean, you've put on like eight

           pounds, nine. It's all in your uterus.

                          ALISON

           Oh, shit. I haven't told them. Do you

           think they're gonna be mad? I'm really

           chickening out about this.

                          WARDROBE LADY

           It's okay. We can hide this. We'll

           dress you in black and we'll emphasize

           your boobs.

           Your boobs are going to be big. And

           then they're going to be like scary

           big. But then they'll go down. And

           then they'll stay down.

           Just don't say anything, okay? Please

           don't say anything.

           Ooh. Did you see this sex offender

           website? These are all the sex

           offenders in our neighborhood.

          Debbie points to the screen which has a map with red dots spread

           Looks like your computer has chicken

           pox.

                          DEBBIE

           Those are sex offenders. These people

           live in our neighborhood.

                          PETE

           We'll skip their houses when we're

           trick or treating. What do you want me

           to do? Form a posse?

                          (TO BEN)

           Got your six-shooter on ya? I got my

           lynching rope.

                          DEBBIE

           You shouldn't take it so lightly.

                          PETE

           I don't take it lightly. I'm not going

           to go over to any of these people's

           houses and say, "Hey, you mind? Can

           you baby sit?"

           them eat fish. There's mercury in the

           What am I doing?

           Because I want to rip your fucking

           I literally am at a point where I

           don't know what I can say.

                          DEBBIE

           So I'm the bad guy because I'm trying

           to protect our kids from child

           molesters and mercury? And you're cool

           because you don't give a shit?

           Yeah.

           Pretty much.

           God, you're an asshole.

                          PETE

           Don't do this in front of Ben.

                          DEBBIE

           I don't give a shit about Ben.

           Sorry, Ben.

                          BEN

           It's okay. I didn't think she did,

                          DEBBIE

           No. You need your own crib.

                          BEN

           There's one of these in an alley

           really think it's just because I

           haven't made an honest woman out of

           her. She's carrying my bastard child.

           No one wants that.

           That's what I did. I married Debbie

           presenting you with this empty box.

           It's a promise, Alison. A promise that

           one day I will fill this with a ring

           that you deserve, a beautiful ring. I

           can't afford it yet. I've picked it

           out, though. It's at De Beers and it's

           really nice. So, basically, I'm asking

           you, will you marry me? Because I'm in

           love with you.

                          ALISON

           I love you too.

                          BEN

           Really? That's so nice to hear. That's

           the first time a girl's ever said that

           to me.

                          ALISON

           But here's the thing.

           KNOCKED UP - 73.

                          BEN

           There's a thing?

                          ALISON

           I don't really know yet what that love

           means. It's so new and it's so

           exciting. It's great. I don't know.

           We've only known each other for

           seventeen weeks.

                          BEN

           Look, I thought you felt weird that

           we're having a baby and we're not

           engaged. I'm going to get off my knee.

           It hurts.

          Ben sits next to Alison on the bed.

                          ALISON

           I'm okay with that. We're just doing

           what we can. I don't want us to put

           any more pressure on ourselves than we

           have.

                          BEN

           That makes sense.

                          ALISON

           I didn't hurt your feelings, did I?

                          BEN

           No. I just wanted to do right by you.

           If you don't want to, that's totally

           cool.

                          ALISON

           I really do love you.

                          BEN

           I know. Thanks. You mentioned that.

           It's nice.

          INT. DEBBIE AND PETE'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Debbie and Alison eat ice cream in bed and watch TV.

                          ALISON

           Ben proposed to me. He did. It was

           really sweet. I feel a little bad. He

           was wearing this great button-down. He

           tucked it in. He got down on one knee.

           He didn't have an actual ring, though,

           just an empty box but he had this

           whole spiel about when he has the

           money, he'll buy me the ring I

           deserve.

                          DEBBIE

           The box was empty?

                          ALISON

           He can't afford a ring.

           KNOCKED UP - 74.

                          DEBBIE

           So he got down on one knee and gave

           you an empty box?

                          ALISON

           Yes.

                          DEBBIE

           I'm sorry.

                          ALISON

           Get over it. If you'd been there, you

           would have cried.

                          DEBBIE

           You need to train him. Oprah said that

           when two people meet they should point

           out each other's differences and

           flaws.

                          ALISON

           I thought you should love people for

           who they are.

                          DEBBIE

           You criticize them a lot, so they get

           so down on themselves they have to

           change.

                          ALISON

           You don't think that's naggy?

                          DEBBIE

           In the end, they thank you for it.

          I/E DEBBIE'S CAR - DAY

          Debbie drives Alison and the girls in her car.

                          DEBBIE

           You can't commit to him. You don't

           even know him. I don't even know Pete

           after ten years. I don't know what

           he's up to. He's miserable.

                          ALISON

           Why do you say that?

                          DEBBIE

           I think he's cheating on me. He's

           always going to business meetings at

           odd hours. Then I try to call him on

           his cell phone and he says he's in bad

           cell phone reception areas when he's

           in good reception areas.

                          ALISON

           Maybe he's working late. Maybe he's

           trying to sign a new band. I can't

           imagine Pete doing that.

                          DEBBIE

           There's no part of you that thinks

           maybe he's a dirty little scumbag?

           KNOCKED UP - 75.

                          ALISON

           No.

                          DEBBIE

           I think he might be.

          INT. DEBBIE AND PETE'S HOUSE, OFFICE - DAY

          Debbie installs software on the computer while Alison watches.

           hide from me now, little man.

          Alison is disturbed by this whole ordeal.

          CARD: 24 WEEKS LATER.

          INT. FANCY RESTAURANT

          Debbie, Pete, Alison and Ben eat dinner together.

                          PETE

           You're not going to tell them?

                          ALISON

           No. I don't have to. It's illegal for

           them to fire me over it. And I get

           three months maternity leave if I

           stay. So I'm not going to tell them.

                          DEBBIE

           Good plan.

                          PETE

           I like it.

                          BEN

           It's a good plan until her water

           breaks over Robert De Niro's shoes.

           (impersonating Robert De

                          NIRO)

           My shoes. There's baby goo on them.

                          NIRO)

           These shoes? On these shoes? Did you

           puke on my shoes?

           Is your water on my shoes?

           KNOCKED UP - 76.

                          PETE

           (back as Pete)

           Isn't it weird, though, when you have

           a kid and all your dreams and hopes go

           right out the window.

                          DEBBIE

           What changed for you? What went out

           the window? You do everything exactly

           the same.

                          PETE

           No, I love what I'm doing. But say

           before you're married with children

           you want to live in India for a year.

           You can do it.

                          DEBBIE

           You want to go to India? Go to India!

           Seriously.

                          PETE

           Do you want to go to India?

                          DEBBIE

           No. You can go.

                          BEN

           I get what he means. Honestly, when I

           found out about...

          Ben motions towards Alison.

                          BEN (CONT'D)

           ...I had this flash of me in a white

           Ford Bronco hauling ass for Canada.

           The chopper's taping it, and I bust

           through the border and I'm free! I

           kept thinking that.

          Alison stares at Ben.

                          BEN (CONT'D)

           It was a flash!

                          ALISON

           What do you mean?

                          BEN

           Don't look at me. We can talk about

           our fears here. If Doc Brown screeched

           up to you in the DeLorean and said,

           "Alison, I got the car here. What do

           you want to do?" No part of you would

           think, "Maybe I'll go back to that

           night and put a condom on Ben's dick?"

           You never got that flash?

                          ALISON

           No. What are you talking about?

                          PETE

           "Where we're going, we don't need

           roads."

           KNOCKED UP - 77.

                          BEN

           You wouldn't do that?

                          ALISON

           I don't know who Doc Brown is. What

           are you talking about?

                          BEN

           Doc Brown is Christopher Lloyd. He

           invented the DeLorean time machine.

                          PETE

           Everyone has a time machine image.

                          DEBBIE

           I have a really good idea. Why don't

           you two get in your time machine, go

           back in time and fuck each other?

                          PETE

           Who needs a time machine?

          Ben holds up his drink.

                          BEN

           This is my time machine!

                          PETE

                          (TO BEN)

           I'll throw you in my DeLorean and gun

           it to 88.

                          (TO PETE)

           You are a funny motherfucker, man.

                          (TO DEBBIE)

           How can you fight with him? I just

           want to kiss his face. He's cute.

                          PETE

                          (TO BEN)

           I like the way you move.

                          BEN

           This is fun! We should do this more.

           I'm sorry, can we change positions?

           I'm going to crush the baby.

           That's ridiculous!

           No, it's not. It has no shell.

           I can't do this. I can't focus like

           It's fine! It's fine!

                          BEN

           Look. My dick must be like an inch

           away from its face and it's coming,

           just coming in at its face. What if it

           kicked because it didn't like it? I

           can't do that to our baby. That's the

           first thing it's going to see.

                          ALISON

           What are you talking about?

                          BEN

           It's having the baby between us, it

           just makes it weird. I'm sorry. It

           just freaks me out a bit. It's a

           little weird.

                          ALISON

           I have totally lost it now.

                          BEN

           You've totally lost it?

                          ALISON

           I've lost it.

                          BEN

           Okay.

                          ALISON

           Great, you know what? Just forget it.

          Alison turns her back to Ben and gets settled to sleep.

                          ALISON (CONT'D)

           (holding back tears)

           Don't worry. I won't make you do this

           again.

                          BEN

           Shit.

          INT. BEN'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Ben smokes his bong.

          Suddenly, there is an earthquake.

           KNOCKED UP - 81.

          INT. BEN'S HOUSE, BEN'S BEDROOM

          Alison wakes up from the earthquake in a panic.

                          ALISON

           Ben?

          INT. BEN'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM

          Ben stands up and tries to steady himself.

                          BEN

           Fuck me.

          Jay runs through the room towards the front door.

                          JAY

           Oh my God! It's the Russians.

          Martin carries Jodi out.

                          MARTIN

           Jodi! I'll protect you!

          Ben clutches his bong and runs to the door. Alison runs to the

          door as well.

                          ALISON

           Ben!

                          BEN

           Oh, my God! Oh, no! Oh, no!

          EXT. BEN'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

          Jay, Martin, Alison, Jodi, Jonah, Jason and Ben stand on the

          street. Jason is naked. Jonah's girlfriend ALEX is also naked.

                          JAY

           That was horrible! That was so

           horrible.

                          JASON

           You're fine, man.

                          JAY

           When will it be light out?

                          JASON

           Take it easy.

                          JAY

           When will it be light out?

                          JASON

           Did anybody turn off the gas?

                          MARTIN

           I didn't do it.

           KNOCKED UP - 82.

                          JASON

           Oh, motherfucker.

          Jason runs back to the house.

                          JONAH

           Martin, this is my friend, Alex. She's

           a pretty incredible person.

                          MARTIN

           Nice to meet you.

          Martin holds out his hand to shake Alex's. She removes one hand

          from covering her breast to shake his hand. Jonah immediately

          covers her breast with his hand.

                          JONAH

           Whoa, whoa, whoa. Dude! Not cool,

           Martin.

                          MARTIN

           That's, that wasn't...

                          JONAH

           Hey, are you serious, Howard Hughes?

                          JODI

           What happened?

                          MARTIN

           Nothing. Nothing happened. Come on.

                          ALISON

                          (TO BEN)

           Where were you?

                          BEN

           Look, I forgot you were sleeping over.

           I'm sorry okay?

                          ALISON

           Yeah, because you were getting high

           off your huge bong. How am I supposed

           to be comfortable with the idea that

           you can take care of me and the baby

           if you are always getting high?

                          BEN

           You want me to stop smoking pot

           because there's an earthquake once

           every ten years? That makes no sense,

           Alison. You're being irrational. Just

           relax. We're all scared. Oh, shit, the

           cops.

          A cop car rolls by. Ben throws his bong behind him and it SHATTERS

          on the payment.

                          BEN (CONT'D)

           California. Hey!

           KNOCKED UP - 83.

          INT. BEN'S HOUSE, BEN'S BEDROOM

          Ben and Alison sort through the debris of porn, trash and weed

          among other things.

          Alison finds Ben's bank statement that indicates he only has only

          $117.13.

                          BEN

           You know it's times like this I'm glad

           I don't own nice things. It's a big

           mess, but there's only like fifty

           bucks worth of shit here. That's kind

           of the good thing. You know, my dad

           told me, "Don't move to Northridge."

           But you figure, what are the chances

           of that happening twice, you know?

          Alison picks up a huge sword.

                          ALISON

           What is this?

                          BEN

           It's a ninja weapon. I hope this place

           doesn't get condemned. That would

           suck.

          Alison finds a shopping bag with the baby books they bought. None

          of them have been read. Alison sadly puts them back without Ben

          noticing.

          CARD: 28 WEEKS LATER.

          INT. BEN'S HOUSE - DAY

          Ben's phone RINGS.

           Hello?

          INT. ALISON'S WORK

          Alison is at her desk at work.

                          ALISON

           Hey it's me.

                         INTERCUT:

                          BEN

           You!

                          ALISON

           Hi! So, listen. Will you do me a big

           favor? Debbie wants us to come over

           and have dinner tonight. She thinks

           Pete is cheating on her.

           KNOCKED UP - 84.

                          BEN

           Really?

                          ALISON

           Yeah. Well, she saw one of his e-mails

           and there's an address. Ugh.

                          BEN

           Oh, man. I don't want to do that.

                          ALISON

           Ben, come on.

                          BEN

           He's not cheating on her.

                          ALISON

           How do you know?

                          BEN

           I just know.

                          ALISON

           Are you sure?

                          BEN

           I'm one hundred percent sure he's not

           cheating.

                          ALISON

           Are you really?

                          BEN

           No. It actually kind of makes sense

           that he would cheat.

                          ALISON

           Why?

                          BEN

           Because Debbie's a pain in the ass and

           Pete's awesome?

                          ALISON

           Well, why don't you just come over

           then, and, we'll just diffuse the

           situation a little?

          INT. DEBBIE AND PETE'S HOUSE, DINING ROOM - NIGHT

          Alison, Ben, Pete and Debbie have dinner.

                          PETE

           I'm just saying the music industry is

           different now. Steely Dan would never

           even have a chance.

                          BEN

           Well, maybe it's because Steely Dan

           gargles my balls.

                          PETE

           They're incredible.

           KNOCKED UP - 85.

                          BEN

           They really aren't good, man.

                          PETE

           Old Steely Dan.

                          BEN

           If I ever listen to Steely Dan, I want

           you to slice my head off with an Al

           Jarreau LP.

                          PETE

           I should get going. I'm supposed to

           see this band tonight in Hollywood.

           Actually, they're playing in Laurel

           Canyon, so I'll call you because the

           reception's terrible over there.

                          BEN

           That's true.

                          PETE

           And I don't want you to worry. I'm

           just going to jump in the shower. It

           would be terrible if I smelled worse

           than the band.

                          DEBBIE

           Okay. Have fun.

          Ben exits.

                          BEN

           You guys are crazy. He's acting

           totally normal and hilarious.

          EXT. FANTASY BASEBALL HOUSE - NIGHT

          Debbie pulls up in front of the house in her car with Alison and

           She doesn't have a gun, does she?

                          ALISON

           No. I don't think so.

                          BEN

           Oh, great.

          INT. FANTASY BASEBALL HOUSE

          Debbie tries the front door, it's unlocked. They enter.

                          BEN

           Looks like no one's home.

                          DEBBIE

           Why was the door unlocked? Wait here.

           KNOCKED UP - 86.

                          BEN

           I just feel bad for Pete.

                          ALISON

           What?

                          BEN

           I feel like this isn't a good way to

           get caught cheating, it shouldn't be

           like this.

                          ALISON

           Well, maybe he should have thought of

           that before he was cheating.

                          BEN

           (through a fake cough)

           Pete!

                          ALISON

           Stop it.

                          BEN

           I coughed. What do you want from me?

          Debbie checks upstairs.

                          DEBBIE

           There's nobody up there.

                          BEN

           Thank you.

                          DEBBIE

           I guess I was wrong.

                          BEN

           I told you. Can we get out of here,

           please?

                          ALISON

           Yeah, come on. Let's go.

          A MURMUR comes from a far room.

                          DEBBIE

           Did you hear that?

                          ALISON

           What?

                          BEN

           I didn't hear anything.

                          ALISON

           Come on.

          Debbie leads them into a room, where Pet sits with a lot of GUYS

          dressed in baseball clothing.

           FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #2

           Excellent choice. Too bad I got him

           three rounds ago.

           FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #1

           You're still on the clock.

                          PETE

           Oh shit!

           FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #1

           You gotta do something. We need a name

           here.

           Ugh, you just took my whole outfield.

                          PETE

           Sorry, Charlie.

                          DEBBIE

           What is this?

                          PETE

           Debbie.

                          DEBBIE

           What the fuck is this?

                          PETE

           It's our fantasy baseball draft.

           FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #2

           We said no wives.

                          DEBBIE

           Your fantasy what?

                          PETE

           It's, it's our draft...for fantasy

           baseball. I told you all about this.

           Got Matsui.

          Debbie turns and walks out of the room.

                          PETE (CONT'D)

           Aw, shit.

           FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #2

           Hey, Pete, don't let the door hit you

           in the vagina on the way out! Come on,

           who's going?

          EXT. FANTASY BASEBALL HOUSE

          Pete and Debbie are in the driveway while Alison and Ben watch

          from the street.

           KNOCKED UP - 88.

                          PETE

          I should have told you.

                          DEBBIE

          What else have you been lying about?

                          PETE

          Nothing.

                          BEN

                          (TO ALISON)

          That guy said, "Don't let the door hit

          you in the vagina on the way out."

                          DEBBIE

          Where were you on Wednesday?

                          PETE

          I'm going to be honest with you.

                          ALISON

                          (TO BEN)

          Yeah, I heard him.

                          BEN

                          (TO ALISON)

          That was hilarious.

          That would be a good idea.

                          PETE

          You've been mad because I've been

          working so much and I didn't want to

          upset you.

                          DEBBIE

          I wouldn't be mad.

                          PETE

          You would be.

                          DEBBIE

          I don't get mad.

                          PETE

          It's a fantasy baseball draft. I'm not

          cheating or anything.

                          DEBBIE

          No, this is worse.

                          PETE

          How is this worse?

                          DEBBIE

          This is you wanting to be with your

          friends more than your family.

                          PETE

          Look, the reason I make that up is

          because if I told you what I was

          really doing, you would just get mad.

          So, you think I'm seeing a band, I do

          my fantasy draft, and it's win/win.

           Well, what did you do last Wednesday

           night when you said you went to see a

           band?

                          PETE

           I went to the movies.

                          DEBBIE

           With who?

                          PETE

           By myself.

           "Spiderman Three."

                          DEBBIE

           Why do you want to go by yourself? Why

           didn't you ask me to go?

                          PETE

           Because I needed to get away, you

           know? With work and you and the kids,

           sometimes I just need some time to

           myself.

                          DEBBIE

           I need time for myself. I want time

           for myself, too.

           I don't want to have to ask you to ask

           me. I want you to just come up with it

           on your own.

                          PETE

           I'm not being mean. I'm being honest.

           You're telling me I need to be honest.

                          JUST--

                          DEBBIE

           No, you're not. You're lying.

                          PETE

           I'm doing it because I need to keep my

           sanity a little bit.

                          DEBBIE

           You know what? I don't want you at the

          Alison drives to the gynecologist with Ben.

                          BEN

           How come we go to the gynecologist so

           often? I bet we have to go so much so

           we can pay for that three-hundred-

           thousand-dollar machine he has.

                          ALISON

           I cannot stop thinking about what an

           asshole Pete is.

                          BEN

           That's a little strong, I would say.

                          ALISON

           Really? Because that had to be one of

           the most selfish things I've ever

           witnessed.

                          BEN

           It's understandable. I even think it's

           kind of funny.

           Don't worry about gaining weight. Your

           Get up.

                          ALISON

           What?

           KNOCKED UP - 96.

                          DEBBIE

           We're not going to do this. Seriously.

          Debbie turns off the television.

                          ALISON

           What are you doing?

                          DEBBIE

           We have to do something! And have fun!

                          ALISON

           I'm just so tired.

                          DEBBIE

           I know you're tired. But we're going

           to be untired! We're going to go live!

                          ALISON

           Ugh. I hate you so much sometimes.

                          DEBBIE

           We're going to be positive.

                          ALISON

           How many Red Bulls have you had?

                          DEBBIE

           I've had about three Red Bulls in the

           last fifteen minutes. And I feel

           fabulous! We're going to create a new

           life and it's going to be awesome!

           Let's go!

          EXT. BEN'S HOUSE

          Ben and Pete KNOCK on the front door.

                          BEN

           Since when do we lock this fucking

           thing? Come on!

          Jason opens the door with Jonah and Jay. All of their eyes are

          very infected.

                          JASON

           Yo. We can't go, dude. Sorry.

                          BEN

           Holy crap! What happened?

                          JONAH

           We got pink eye.

                          BEN

           What? You giving each other butterfly

           kisses or something?

                          JASON

           Very funny. That's not how you get

           pink eye. You get it from poo

           particles making their way into your

           ocular cavities.

           KNOCKED UP - 97.

                          JAY

           Hey, Ben.

                          BEN

           Yo.

                          JAY

           How's it going? I farted on Jason's

           pillow as a practical joke. He farted

           on Jonah's, thinking it was mine. And

           then eventually pink-eyes my pillow.

           I'm not proud of this. But, I think

           we've all forgiven each other. But, we

           can't go anywhere.

                          PETE

           You can get pink eye from farting in a

           pillow?

                          JONAH

           Totally.

                          PETE

           That's awesome.

                          JONAH

           Yeah, but you got to be bare-assed.

          Martin enters the doorway, his eyes are the worst.

                          BEN

           Jesus. Martin got it bad! What, did

           someone take a dump right in your eye?

                          MARTIN

           No. No pink eye for me. I'm just

           really...high.

                          BEN

           Well stay back, guys. I got to get my

           suit.

          Ben enters the house and the guys pretend they're going to rub

          their faces on him. Pete stays outside.

                          JASON

                          (TO PETE)

           Are you Debbie's husband?

                          PETE

           Yeah.

          Jason shuts the door on Pete.

          I/E. PETE'S CONVERTIBLE - NIGHT

          Pete drives with Ben to Vegas. They are wearing suits.

                          BEN

           This is fun!

           KNOCKED UP - 98.

                          PETE

           This is great. We're going to have the

           best time ever.

                          BEN

           We make a good team, man.

                          PETE

           Yep. It's like I can't come here with

           Debbie. She doesn't understand. It's

           like she wants to hold me in, and she

           was telling Alison she could train

           you.

                          BEN

           She thinks she could train me?

                          PETE

           Yeah, like you're running the Triple

           Crown.

                          BEN

           She can't train this! I'm like

           Siegfried and Roy's Bengal. You think

           I'm trained. I'll bite your fucking

           face off.

                          PETE

           That's right.

                          BEN

           In front of a crowd, baby.

                          PETE

           This is better. Besides I don't know

           if I have enough of these babies to go

           around.

          Pete brandishes a bag of mushrooms.

                          BEN

           Oh, my God. Are these mushrooms?

                          PETE

           I got them from a roadie for the Black

           Crowes.

                          BEN

           I'm eating them.

                          PETE

           Oh, no, save it! I got tickets to

           Cirque du Soleil.

                          BEN

           You do?! No you don't.

                          PETE

           I swear to God, man.

                          BEN

           Holy shit!

                          PETE

           I see the beam of light.

           KNOCKED UP - 99.

                          BEN

           There it is, baby.

                          PETE

           Woo-hoo. You're so money that you

           don't even know how much money you

           have.

          INT. STRIP CLUB

          Ben and Pete receive lap dances from topless strippers.

                          BEN

           I love Vegas, man.

                          PETE

           This is the greatest place on earth.

                          BEN

           It's really amazing here.

          The stripper straddles Pete and pulls his tie through her legs so

          that he face is pulled against her butt.

                          PETE

           Whoa. You got my tie. This is awesome.

                          BEN

           Now that's how you get pink eye.

          EXT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

          Debbie and Alison approach the nightclub, passing the line,

          straight to the DOORMAN. The Doorman lets TWO PRETTY GIRLS past

          the rope.

                          DOORMAN

           (to the Two Pretty Girls)

           Hey, what's up, baby girl?

          Debbie and Alison move up to the doorman.

                          DEBBIE

           Hi.

                          DOORMAN

           What's up? End of the line, please.

                          DEBBIE

           Really?

                          DOORMAN

           Yeah.

                          DEBBIE

           Oh, come on.

                          DOORMAN

           Look, we're at capacity, okay? We'll

           let some people in when it clears out

           a little. You'll get right in if you

           go back to the end of the line.

           KNOCKED UP - 100.

                          DEBBIE

           We come here all the time. It's not a

           big deal. It doesn't really look that

           crowded in there.

                          DOORMAN

           Hey, look, I don't make the rules.

                          DEBBIE

           Please?

                          DOORMAN

           No.

          TWO CUTE GIRLS approach. The Doorman lifts the rope for them.

                          DOORMAN (CONT'D)

           Hey, what's up, shorty? What's up

           pretty girls? See y'all when y'all get

           out. Take care of yourself.

                          DEBBIE

           What was that? What the fuck was that?

                          DOORMAN

           It is what it is, sweetie. Now can you

           step to the back, please?

                          ALISON

                          (TO DEBBIE)

           You know what? Maybe we should just

           go.

                          DEBBIE

           You don't need to call me sweetie.

                          DOORMAN

           Yeah, but maybe you should listen to

           your friend.

                          DEBBIE

           No, you don't need to call me sweetie.

                          DOORMAN

           All right, you want to come in, you're

           going to have to go to the end of the

           line and wait like everybody else.

                          DEBBIE

           I'm not going to go to the end of the

           fucking line. Who the fuck are you? I

           have just as much of a right to be

           here as any of these little skanky

           girls! What, am I not skanky enough

           for you?! You want me to hike up my

           fucking skirt?! What the fuck is your

           problem?! I'm not going anywhere!

           You're just some `roided out freak

           with a fucking clipboard. And your

           stupid little fucking rope! You may

           have power now, but you're not God.

           You're a doorman! Okay? You're a

           doorman! So...fuck you, you fucking

           fag with your fucking little faggy

           gloves.

           KNOCKED UP - 101.

          The Doorman grabs Debbie and takes her aside.

                          DOORMAN

           Come here, come on.

          The Doorman takes Debbie aside.

                          DOORMAN

                          (WHISPERING)

           I know. You're right. I'm so sorry. I

           fucking hate this job. I don't want to

           be the one to pass judgement and

           decide who gets in. This shit makes me

           sick to my stomach. I get the runs

           from the stress. It's not because

           you're not hot. I would love to tap

           that ass. I would tear that ass up. I

           can't let you in because you're old as

           fuck...for this club, not, you know,

           for the earth.

                          DEBBIE

           What?

                          DOORMAN

           You old. She pregnant. Can't have a

           bunch of old, pregnant bitches running

           around. That's crazy. I'm only allowed

           to let in five percent black people.

           He said that. Five percent. That mean

           if there's twenty-five people here, I

           get to let in one-and-a-quarter black

           people. So I got to hope there's a

           black midget in the crowd.

                          DEBBIE

           Now I feel guilty. I'm sorry.

                          DOORMAN

           Why y'all want to be in here anyway?

           Y'all need to be at a yoga class or

           something.

                          (REGARDING ALISON)

           What the fuck is she doing at the

           club? That's not even good parenting

           right there. Your old ass should know

           better than that.

                          DEBBIE

           Oh, God. Ugh.

          Debbie takes Alison away.

          EXT. VEGAS POOL - NIGHT

          Ben and Pete hold neon yard glasses and walk past numerous

          swimsuit-clad men and women.

                          BEN

           Have the mushrooms kicked in yet?

          Ben and Pete CHUCKLE uncontrollably.

           KNOCKED UP - 102.

          EXT. TREASURE ISLAND HOTEL - NIGHT

          Establishing shot.

          INT. CIRQUE DU SOLEIL

          Ben and Pete watch from the crowd as acrobats climb poles.

           BEN AND PETE

           Ohhhhhh!

                          BEN

           This was a great idea, man.

                          PETE

           This is the best idea I've ever had in

           my life.

          Two bare-chested male acrobats start to balance on top of each

          other.

                          BEN

           What are they going to do? What in the

           world are they doing? If I shaved my

           stomach and my chest, I would look

           exactly like that. Those guys are at

           work right now.

           (imitating one of the

                          ACROBATS)

           What'd you do today? Oh, just lifted

           my brother.

          The crowd starts to APPLAUD for the acrobats.

                          BEN (CONT'D)

           No! Don't applaud! He'll fall! I'm

           freaking out right now, man!

          Many acrobats in devilish outfits take the stage.

                          BEN (CONT'D)

           The mushrooms are turning on me!

          A clown dressed as a GIANT BABY is part of the act. Ben YELLS

          frantically.

                          GIANT BABY

           Papa.

                          BEN

           I am not your papa.

          A giant Snail comes out onto the stage.

                          BEN (CONT'D)

           I can't deal with this shit, man!

          Ben stands up and runs down the aisle towards the exit.

           KNOCKED UP - 103.

          EXT. STREET NEAR NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

          Debbie and Alison sit on the curb.

                          DEBBIE

                          (WEEPING)

           It's over.

                          ALISON

           What's over?

                          DEBBIE

           My youth.

                          ALISON

           Don't say that.

                          DEBBIE

           It's true. I just want to dance. I

           love dancing.

                          ALISON

           So dance.

                          DEBBIE

           I can't dance. I'm embarrassed.

                          ALISON

           I should be embarrassed. I'm a fucking

           whale and I'm trying to get into some

           stupid club and--

                          DEBBIE

           You look beautiful. You're young and

           you're tall and you got the good lips

           and boobs. I'm going to be alone.

                          ALISON

           Debbie, no, you're not.

                          DEBBIE

           Yes, I am. Oh, God! Fucking, men! I

           get worse looking and he gets better

           looking, and it's so fucking unfair.

           Oh, fuck. We should go. My babysitter

           always gets mad when we come home past

           twelve. She's such a pissy little high-

           school cunt.

          INT. VEGAS HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          Ben curls up on the bed with his shirt and boxers on. A scene from

          "CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN" plays on the television. Steve Martin

          juggles all of his children.

                          STEVE MARTIN

                          (ON TV)

           Let's move, gang! Come on, come on,

           come on! Jessica, can you get these

           plates and put them on the table,

           please?!

           KNOCKED UP - 104.

                          BEN

           This isn't funny. That guy has twelve

           kids. It's not funny. This is sick.

           This is a sick movie. That's a lot of

           responsibility to be joking about.

           That's not funny. I got to turn this

           off. It's freaking me out.

          Pete moves several chairs into the bedroom.

                          PETE

           There are five different types of

           chairs in this hotel room.

                          BEN

           Holy fuck. What are they all doing in

           here?

                          PETE

           These are five different types of

           chair.

                          BEN

           Get them out of here, man. This is too

           many chairs for one room.

                          PETE

           There's a guy that works for this

           hotel. His whole job is to find

           chairs.

          Pete moves to a tall chair.

                          PETE (CONT'D)

           Look at this one. Look at it. It's

           gold and red and it's kind of shiny.

           Shiny thread? Unbelievable. It is

           beautiful, and it feels amazing.

                          BEN

           The tall one's gawking at me and the

           short one's being very droll. I don't

           like them.

          Pete switches to another chair.

                          PETE

           Oh, wow!

                          BEN

           It's weird that chairs even exist when

           you're not sitting on them.

          Pete switched to another tall chair.

                          PETE

           I'm up high! I'm really high up.

                          BEN

           I should've read the baby books.

                          PETE

           Why didn't you read the baby books?

           KNOCKED UP - 105.

                          BEN

           Because then it's real, you know?

                          PETE

           Dude, it's real whether or not you

           read those books. That baby's coming.

          Pete sits on another chair.

                          PETE (CONT'D)

           Oh, man!

                          BEN

           Think they'll take us back?

                          PETE

           Yes. But I don't know why. Do you ever

           wonder how somebody could even like

           you?

                          BEN

           All the time, man. Like every day. I

           wonder how you like me.

                          PETE

           How can Debbie like me? She likes me.

           I mean, she loves me. The biggest

           problem in our marriage is that she

           wants me around. She loves me so much

           that she wants me around all the time.

           That's our biggest problem. And I

           can't even accept that? Uh, like that

           upsets me?!

          Ben sits up from the bed.

                          BEN

           What?

                          PETE

           She's the one. She loves me.

                          BEN

           You can't believe...that people love

           you? I love you, man! Debbie loves

           you!

                          PETE

           I don't think I can accept her love.

           There's something wrong with me.

                          BEN

           You can't accept love?

                          PETE

           I don't know what it is.

                          BEN

           Love? The most beautiful, shiny, warmy

           thing in the world? You can't accept

           it?

                          PETE

           I have to go to this other chair.

           KNOCKED UP - 106.

          Pete switches to a new chair.

                          PETE (CONT'D)

           Oh, this is a better energy.

                          BEN

           You can't accept pure love? You can't

           accept Debbie? She's chosen to give

           you her life. She's picked you as her

           life partner! But you play fantasy

           baseball because you can't accept her

           love?

          Ben BURPS.

                          BEN (CONT'D)

           Ugh. I could accept it, man. And

           Debbie's amazing, man. She's cool and

           she's funny and she smells good and

           she's nice and her hair always looks

           different. She's too good for you,

           man.

          Pete shoves his hand in his mouth.

                          PETE

           Tastes like a rainbow.

                          BEN

           You're disgusting. You're an urchin.

           And she busts your balls because

           you're a little bitch! You're a filthy

           bitch! And I'd bust your balls! Debbie

           wants to give her life to you and

           Alison doesn't want to do that with

           me. And it makes me sad all day. I

           want to go home.

                          PETE

           (with fist in mouth)

           I want to go home, too.

           Everything looks beautiful.

           Thanks. I went kind of overboard, huh?

                          ALISON

           No, it's great.

                          DEBBIE

           I don't think so. I don't know why he

           would.

          EXT. DEBBIE AND PETE'S HOUSE

          Ben approaches the house with a present. He wears a button-down

          shirt and long khaki shorts. He KNOCKS on the door. Sadie opens

          the door.

                          BEN

           Oh, hey, what up dog?

                          SADIE

           Where have you been?

           Why is everybody so mad at you?

                          BEN

           I don't know. Are they mad? What have

           they been saying?

                          SADIE

           They've been saying, like "blah-blah-

           blah-blah. Ben's a prick."

                          BEN

           They said that?

                          SADIE

           A lot.

                          BEN

           That sucks.

           What does it mean?

           Penis. It means penis.

           Did you just get pink cupcakes or

           yellow and pink cupcakes?

                          PETE

           I just got yellow cupcakes.

                          DEBBIE

           I thought I said to get pink cupcakes.

                          PETE

           I can run out. I'll get some more.

                          DEBBIE

           Nah, it's no big deal.

                          PETE

           I don't mind.

                          ALISON

           I just don't think we can make it

           work.

                          BEN

           We can get back on track and

           everything's going to be great.

                          ALISON

           You're just being nice. And I'm being

           nice and just because we're two nice

           people doesn't mean we should stay

           together. I don't want this baby to

           determine the rest of our lives. You

           know? Me not wanting to do this alone

           isn't enough of a reason to drag you

           into a relationship with me. It's just

           not fair. And, and don't repeat this,

           but, God, I don't want to end up like

           Debbie.

                          BEN

           But Debbie's happy.

                          ALISON

           She's happy today. But every day is a

           constant struggle for them because

           they're not right for each other. You

           know? And they have to force it and I

           don't want us to have to do that. I

           don't want to force you to be what I

           think you should be. That's wrong of

           me because you're great. You really

           are. You're great the way you are and,

           I mean, you like to get high and you

           like to do shrooms in Vegas.

           And who am I to stop you? Who am I to

           tell you that that's wrong? It's not

           wrong. It's who you are. It's what you

           Ben, I've been divorced three times.

           Why would you listen to me?

                          BEN

           Because you were the only one giving

           me advice! And it was, it was terrible

           advice!

           HARRIS (O.S.)

           You can go around blaming everyone

           else, but in the end, until you take

           responsibility for yourself, none of

           this is going to work out.

           I don't know how to take

           didn't read the baby books!

           don't want to shock you, but know

           what's under that jacket. You're

           pregnant, have been for a while. From

           my count, you're right around eight

           months. And I don't know why you felt

           you couldn't tell us.

                          ALISON

           I'm really sorry.

                          JILL

           This is Hollywood. We don't like

           liars.

           I just wasn't expecting this and, I

           didn't know how to handle it, and I

           didn't want to lose my job. I'm really

           sorry.

                          JACK

           It's unfortunate that you didn't tell

           us because you would've found out that

           we thought it's great.

          Yeah.

          So, we did some research. And turns

          out, people like pregnant.

          The bigger you are, the bigger your

          numbers.

          I was surprised because I feel the

          opposite.

          Really?

          Yes.

                          JILL

          Scary!

                          JACK

          If you're pregnant, they're pregnant,

          you can talk about being pregnant.

                          JILL

          It just grosses me out...when I know

          that people are pregnant. Because I

          think about the birth. Everything's so

          wet.

                          JACK

          And everything that goes into it. None

          of the gross stuff. But you know,

          hopes, dreams, whatever. It's going to

          be great.

                          ALISON

          Oh, my God. This is such good news.

          Thank you so much.

          You're welcome. And then, after the

          baby is out, tighten it back up.

                          JILL

           DR. ANGELO

           Dr. Howard is not available tonight.

           Bet everything's going to be okay, I

           assure you.

                          ALISON

           No, I don't want you to help me

           because I have no idea who you are! I

           want my own goddamned doctor! You make

           sure he calls me!

          Alison clicks off the phone.

                          ALISON (CONT'D)

                          (TO HERSELF)

           Oh, shit. Okay. Oh, shit.

          Alison calls Ben.

          INT. BEN'S NEW APARTMENT

          Ben's sleeps in his bed. His phone RINGS. He blindly fishes for

          the phone.

                          BEN

           Hello?

          I/E BEN'S CAR - NIGHT

          Ben feverishly drives to Alison.

                          BEN

                          (TO CAR)

           Oh, don't run out of gas! Don't run

           out of gas! Come on!

           KNOCKED UP - 120.

          INT. ALISON'S GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT

          Ben runs into Alison's guest house. It is empty.

                          BEN

           Hello?

          EXT. DEBBIE AND PETE'S HOUSE, BACKYARD

          Ben uses the back door to get into the house.

          INT. DEBBIE AND PETE'S HOUSE, BEDROOM

          Ben checks every room in the house.

                          BEN

           Please be in here. Hello? Hello!

          INT. DEBBIE AND PETE'S HOUSE, BATHROOM

          Ben finds Alison in a bubble bath surrounded by candles and

          SOOTHING MUSIC.

                          BEN

           Hello? Alison. Hello?

                          ALISON

           Ben?

                          BEN

           Alison. What is this, like a water

           birth? What are we doing? Should we

           go?

                          ALISON

           Shh! Just relax, okay? Just be mellow,

           because that's what this is all about.

           Because if it gets too stressful in

           here then the baby is born into a

           stressful environment and then he's

           wired for stress for the rest of his

           life. So just...just be calm.

                          BEN

                          (WHISPERING)

           Okay. Okay. Let's relax. Do you want

           to talk about things? I feel really

           bad about a lot of the shit I did. I

           can't believe I said some of that.

           That's all I think about in my head.

                          IT--

                          ALISON

           I don't want to talk about it.

                          BEN

           But maybe we could bring the baby into

           a reconciled place so, we can talk--

           KNOCKED UP - 121.

                          ALISON

           No. I don't want to go there. Don't go

           there, okay?

                          BEN

           Okay.

                          ALISON

           Help me stay relaxed.

                          BEN

           So, what should I do?

                          ALISON

           You need to call Dr. Howard.

          Ben goes into the hall and calls Dr. Howard's house.

          INT. DR. HOWARD'S HOUSE

          Dr. Howard's housekeeper, MARIA, answers the phone.

                          MARIA

           Hello?

          INT. DEBBIE AND PETE'S HOUSE, BATHROOM

                          BEN

           Hello, this is Ben Stone. I'm calling

           on behalf of Alison Scott. We need Dr.

           Howard. It's an emergency.

          INT. DR. HOWARD'S HOUSE

                          MARIA

           He's at San Francisco at Bar Mitzvah.

                         INTERCUT:

                          BEN

           He's at a Bar Mitzvah in San

           Francisco? Do you know when he gets

           back?

                          MARIA

           In three days.

                          BEN

           Do you have his cell number, by any

           chance?

          Ben pops his head around the corner to talk to Alison.

                          BEN (CONT'D)

                          (TO ALISON)

           Hey! Good news. I got his number right

           here. I'm going to call him right now.

                          ALISON

           Great. Thank you so much. I'm so glad

           you're here. Thank you.

           KNOCKED UP - 122.

                          BEN

           I'm glad I'm here, too. Thank you. I

           shouldn't have told you you were a

           fucking lunatic. I shouldn't have said

           that. I feel terrible about it.

                          ALISON

           No, it's okay. We're past it. I'm

           sorry I told you to fuck your bong.

                          BEN

           It's okay. I didn't

                          ALISON

           Let's just drop it now. We're over it.

                          BEN

           I'm going to call him right now.

           You're doing so great.

          Ben slips into the hallway and calls Dr. Howard.

           DR. HOWARD (O.S.)

           Hello, it's Dr. Howard. I'm not here

           right now. Please leave a message.

                          BEN

           (into the phone)

           Hey, Doc Howard. Ben Stone calling.

           Guess what the fuck's up? Alison's

           going into labor and you are not

           fucking here. Now, where are you?

           You're at a fucking Bar Mitzvah in San

           Francisco, you motherfucking piece of

           shit! And you know I'm going to have

           to do now? I'm going to have to kill

           you. I'm going to have to pop a cap in

           your ass. You're dead! You're Tupac!

           You are fucking Biggie, you piece of

           shit! I hope you fucking die or drop

           the fucking chair and kill that

           fucking kid! Hope your plane crashes.

           Peace, fucker!

          Ben goes back to Alison.

                          ALISON

           Hey.

                          BEN

           Hey.

                          ALISON

           Did you talk to him?

                          BEN

           I didn't talk to him directly, I left

           him a very nice message, though. What

           I'm about to tell you isn't that bad.

           You should know that going in. We can

           get through this and it's just a

           little hiccup, but everything will be

           fine. Do you trust me when I say

           everything will be fine?

           KNOCKED UP - 123.

                          ALISON

          I can deal with it.

                          BEN

          Okay. So, Dr. Howard is at a Bar

          Mitzvah.

                          ALISON

          A Bar Mitzvah?

                          BEN

          It's a Jewish rite of passage. And

          he's going to be there for the next

          three days, so he will not be able to

          be here tonight.

                          ALISON

          It's okay. What do you think we should

          do?

                          BEN

          I know exactly what to do. All we do

          is we'll get in the car, I'll drive to

          the hospital, and on the way, we will

          call every gynecologist we've met.

          Someone will be available. You know?

                          ALISON

          I can do that.

                          BEN

          Good. We still have time. I mean, how

          far apart are your contractions?

                          ALISON

          I think, like, seven minutes.

                          BEN

          Seven minutes! See? Not until four

          minutes is it really coming. And has

          your water broken, even?

                          ALISON

          I don't know. I'm in the tub.

                          BEN

          That's a good point. Have you had,

          have you had your bloody show?

                          ALISON

          What's that?

                          BEN

          It's a bloody mucusy discharge. But it

          only comes out right before the baby's

          going to come, so if that hasn't

          happened, we have time. We can make it

          to the hospital. It's no problem.

                          ALISON

          You read the baby books.

                          BEN

          Yeah. I did. I read three of them,

          actually.

           KNOCKED UP - 124.

                          ALISON

           Thank you.

                          BEN

           You're welcome.

          EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

          Ben drives Alison's car. They park in a handicapped spot.

                          ALISON

           Wait. Are we allowed to park here?

                          BEN

           It's okay.

          Ben takes a handicapped placard out of his jacket pocket and hangs

          it on the mirror.

                          BEN (CONT'D)

           I stole this from Martin's grandma.

                          ALISON

           Oh. That was really sweet of you.

                          BEN

           Thanks.

          INT. HOSPITAL - FRONT DESK

          Alison and Ben approach the desk. A male nurse, SAMUEL, and a

          FEMALE NURSE tend to them.

                          BEN

                          (TO ALISON)

           We're close. Home stretch.

           (to Female Nurse)

           Hello. This is Alison Scott. Dr. Kuni

           said he would let you know we were

           coming?

                          FEMALE NURSE

           He did. We'll take good care of you.

           Samuel?

                          SAMUEL

           Yeah?

                          FEMALE NURSE

           This is Alison Scott. Please admit her

           into room 307.

                          SAMUEL

           All right. Hi.

                          BEN

           You're our nurse?

                          SAMUEL

           That's why I'm holding the clipboard.

           So, uh, what else is up with you guys?

           KNOCKED UP - 125.

          Ben and Alison stare at Samuel.

                          SAMUEL (CONT'D)

           I'm just joking. Let's have a baby!

          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

          Samuel is adjusting Alison's IV.

                          SAMUEL

           So, I'm sorry it took me so long to

           find that vein. That little guy really

           didn't want me to find him.

                          ALISON

           Is that the baby on that one right

           there?

          Alison points to some equipment by her bed side.

                          SAMUEL

           Yeah. That's how we can tell how the

           little guy or gal is doing.

                          ALISON

           Okay.

          A groggy Dr. Kuni enters.

           DR. KUNI

           Hello, Alison, Ben. Interesting night.

                          BEN

           We really, really appreciate you

           coming, man.

           DR. KUNI

           What else do I have to do, I mean,

           besides sleep? I was only kidding.

           What happened to your doctor?

                          BEN

           He's at a Bar Mitzvah in San

           Francisco. He didn't tell us though.

           DR. KUNI

           Nice.

                          BEN

           Yeah.

           DR. KUNI

           Lucky for you I don't have any Jewish

           friends.

                          ALISON

           Dr. Kuni, I really want to do this

           naturally. I don't want to use drugs.

           DR. KUNI

           Let's just take a look and see what

           happens, okay? Fetal heart rate is

           good. Samuel, where are we?

           you need to relax and embrace the

                          JONAH

           I'm not having shit besides a fucking

           I could do this all day.

          The fetal heart monitors begins to BEEP.

                          ALISON

           What was that?

                          BEN

           Well, boy and girls, what seems to be

           the problem?

                          SAMUEL

           Decels.

           DR. KUNI

           Oh, dear. Okay. Alison, I need you to

           turn on your back now, okay? The

           baby's heart rate is slowing. Okay?

                          BEN

           It's going to be okay.

           (to Dr. Kuni)

           Is it going to be fine?

          Alison turns onto her back.

           DR. KUNI

           It's going to be fine. Okay?

                          (TO ALISON)

           You're going to feel a little bit of a

           push.

          Dr. Kuni tries to reposition the baby.

                          BEN

           What are you doing?

           DR. KUNI

           I'm turning the baby so I can take the

           pressure off the cord.

                          ALISON

           Oh, my God.

          The monitors stops beeping.

           KNOCKED UP - 128.

           DR. KUNI

           We're good. The heartbeat's stronger,

           but we're not out of the woods. We

           need to get things going now. I think

           the cord is wrapped around the neck.

           Okay?

                          BEN

           What?

           DR. KUNI

           So I'm going to give you some

           medicine, pop the bag and get things

           going, okay? I don't want to leave the

           baby in there for long and we can give

           you some medicine for the pain.

                          ALISON

           No, no, no, no. I don't want the baby

           to be born all drugged out. It's not

           my birth plan.

           DR. KUNI

           Now, things change. We don't have time

           to debate this.

                          ALISON

           What? No. But no, I'm not comfortable

           with that. I'm not.

                          BEN

           No. Would you please just listen to

           her?

           DR. KUNI

           Fine. Do what you want to do.

                          BEN

           Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?

           DR. KUNI

           Should I leave? Do you want to be the

           doctor? Because I really don't need to

           be here.

                          BEN

           No. What we want is to take a second

           to talk about our options, okay?

           That's all we want.

           DR. KUNI

           No. You mean you want to take a second

           to tell me how to do my job. My job is

           to get that baby out safely. Or I can

           go home! You just let me know. You be

           the doctor.

                          BEN

           Can we talk outside in the hall for a

           second?

          INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY

          Ben and Dr. Kuni stand in the hallway.

           KNOCKED UP - 129.

           DR. KUNI

           That woman is a control freak, and she

           needs to let go and let me do my job.

                          BEN

           Look, she's just having a hard time

           because her and her doctor had a very

           specific birth plan. And they wanted

           it to be a very special experience.

           DR. KUNI

           Okay. if you want a special

           experience, go to a Jimmy Buffet

           concert. We have a new birth plan: Get

           the baby out safely.

                          BEN

           Look, man, will you help us out? I

           have no idea what I'm doing. You can

           be as big a dick to me as you want.

           Just be nice to her, man. That's all I

           ask. Just please be nice to her.

          Ben's stomach GROWLS loudly.

           DR. KUNI

           Are you okay?

                          BEN

           I think so.

           DR. KUNI

           I'm sorry. Let's start fresh.

                          BEN

           Thank you, man.

           DR. KUNI

           This is healthy. This is good. I think

           we're bonding.

          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

          Dr. Kuni and Ben come back into the room.

           DR. KUNI

           Alison, I apologize for being a little

           brash, but if you're okay with it,

           it's rather important we break the bag

           and give you some medicine to speed

           things up. Because once the bag is

           broken, I don't want there to be an

           infection.

                          ALISON

           Whatever. Do what you have to do.

          Dr. Kuni exits.

                          ALISON (CONT'D)

           (whispering to Ben)

           Oh, my God. What a nightmare that guy

           is.

           KNOCKED UP - 130.

                          BEN

           I know, I know. Look, I talked to him.

           I think he'll be more cool now.

                          ALISON

           I'm so sorry I broke up with you.

                          BEN

           You really don't need to be. And you

           know, I knew you'd give me another

           shot. I figured it'd be a lot sooner

           than this, you know?

                          ALISON

           I was just in such a panic from all of

           this. And watching Debbie and Pete

           together, and my ass got so fat.

                          BEN

           No, no.

                          ALISON

           It did. I just never, for one minute,

           thought that the guy who got me

           pregnant would actually be the right

           guy for me.

                          BEN

           Me neither.

                          ALISON

           I guess he is.

           Hi. I can't believe I go out of town

           and this happens.

                          ALISON

           I know.

                          DEBBIE

           I'm sorry, but I'm not going anywhere.

                          ALISON

           Screw Legoland.

                          PETE

           All right, how do you want this? You

           want this over the shoulder? I can do

           whatever you want. I can get in there.

           Kind of Spike Lee angles.

                          ALISON

           No, you can shoot the waiting room.

           That would be great.

                          DEBBIE

                          (TO BEN)

           Well, thank you. I've got it from

           second?

                          DEBBIE

           Why?

          INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY

          Ben and Debbie talk in the hallway alone.

                          BEN

           I'd like to be in there with

           Alison...without you.

                          DEBBIE

           Look, Debbie, you are high off your

           ass if you think you're coming into

           that room. If you take one step

           towards that door, I will tell

           security there's a crazy chick in a

           pink dress snatching up babies. Okay?

           So don't even try to come into that

           room. That's my room now. That little

           area with the Pepsi machine...that's

           your area. My room. Your area. Stay in

           your area. Stay out of my room. Back

           He just kicked me out. He told me to

           leave. But I guess it's good, right?

           He said he's going to take care of

           her. He really seems on his game. I

           think he's going to be a good dad. I

           think I like him. Thank God.

           Okay?

           DR. KUNI

           We can't give you the epidural.

           Take the time! I'll make sure it

           doesn't come out! I'll stop pushing.

           We have time.

           Just do it, please!

           DR. KUNI

           I'm sorry. We have no time. We're

           going to just have to do this the all

           natural way, okay? The way you wanted

           to do it. Okay? Ready?

                          ALISON

           Okay.

           DR. KUNI

           Here comes another contraction, okay?

           I want you to push. Okay, ready? Good,

                          SAMUEL

           Maybe we can take it down just a

           little. I think you're going to scare

           No, no. I mean, granted, gynecology's

           only a hobby of mine, but it sounds to

           me like she's crowning. Is that right,

           Deb?

           No, I disagree with you. That sounds

           Oh, God. Honey, what does it look

           like, Ben?

          Been peers down between Alison's legs.

          We actually see the crowning shot as the baby's head is being

          pushed out of Alison's vagina.

           Oh, God.

           go in there. Promise me you don't go

           in there.

                          JONAH

           Me go in there? That's the last

           fucking place I want to go. Like I'm

           going to go in there. Try getting a

           boner now.

          Jason beams at Debbie.

                          JASON

           What's up Deb?

                          DEBBIE

           Hey.

          Pete looks at Debbie.

          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

          The birth is still in progress.

           DR. KUNI

           Push. One, two, three.

                          ALISON

           Oh, God!

           DR. KUNI

           You've passed the shoulders. One more

           big push. Good.

          The baby comes out. Dr. Kuni cleans it up.

           KNOCKED UP - 136.

                          ALISON

           Oh, Ben. I did it.

                          BEN

           You did it.

                          ALISON

           It's out.

                          BEN

           You did it. Oh, my God, you did it.

          Dr. Kuni hands the baby to Alison.

                          ALISON

           Hi, baby. I love you, Ben.

                          BEN

           I love you so much, too. Oh, my God.

           DR. KUNI

           Congratulations, you two. Beautiful.

                          ALISON

           Thank you.

           DR. KUNI

           You did so great. You were amazing.

                          ALISON

           Pretty baby.

                          BEN

           You got out. You made it out. Welcome.

          INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM

                          MARTIN

           You ever get so bored you just stare

           at your balls?

                          JONAH

           I bet you do, late John Lennon.

                          MARTIN

           Here we go again.

                          DEBBIE

           (whispering to Pete)

           Who is that? Is that Ben's rabbi? Is

           he the one who cuts the penis?

                          PETE

           I think it's Matisyahu.

                          MARTIN

           Awesome.

                          JASON

           You want out of the bet?

                          MARTIN

           I want out of the bet.

           KNOCKED UP - 137.

                          JASON

           You know what you have to say. Just

           say it, man. I think now is the time.

                          MARTIN

           "Jason, you're the master."

                          JASON

           You heard it, right?

                          JAY

           Yeah.

                          JASON

           All right. You're out of the bet.

           You're done.

          Martin hugs Jason.

                          JASON (CONT'D)

           Your face smells like an old man's

           balls.

                          MARTIN

           Thank you.

          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

          Debbie and Pete come to check in on Alison.

                          DEBBIE

           Oh, my God. Hello. My goodness. She's

           beautiful. She's beautiful. I love

           you, Ben.

                          BEN

           I love you, Debbie.

                          DEBBIE

                          (TO PETE)

           We're going to have another baby.

                          PETE

           Okay.

          Pete turns the camera on himself and shakes his head "no."

                          DEBBIE

           Hello, baby.

          INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM

          Ben enters the waiting room to talk to the guys.

                          BEN

           Gentlemen, it's a girl!

                          THE GUYS

           Ohhhhhhh!

                          BEN

           Yeah!

           KNOCKED UP - 138.

          They all hug.

                          JAY

           We got a daughter! Mazel Tov!

                          JASON

           Congratulations, Daddy!

                          JAY

           We got a beautiful little girl!

                          BEN

           Let's meet her! She's awesome.

                          JAY

           A beautiful little girl!

                          JASON

           Let's meet her. Aw.

          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

          Alison sleeps while Ben holds the baby. Everyone else has gone

          home.

                          BEN

           (to the baby)

           And then your mommy said, "Just do it,

           already," which was very confusing to

           Daddy. So I listened to the most

           literal translation of that and I just

           did it, already. What would you do?

           Don't tell Mommy, but it was the

           smartest thing I ever did, listening

           to her, because now you're here. Isn't

           that nice? I think it is.

          EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

          Ben and a Nurse push Alison and the baby in a wheelchair.

          I/E ALISON'S CAR

          Ben drives while Alison and the baby are in the back seat.

                          ALISON

           I hope your apartment's big enough for

           the three of us.

                          BEN

           It definitely is. That's why I got one

           in East LA. The rent. It's huge! The

           only thing is we have to decide if

           we're going to be Crips or Bloods

           before we get there.

                          ALISON

           Well, I look good in red.

           KNOCKED UP - 139.

                          BEN

           I look good in blue. The fighting

           continues. We could just throw off

           everyone and become Latin Kings.

                          ALISON

           Yeah.

                          BEN

           We both look good in gold.

                          ALISON

           Good choice. I would yell at you about

           driving so slow, except the baby's

           here.

                          BEN

           No, these guys can honk all they want.

           I ain't going faster than twelve. It

           might take us around three hours to

           get home, though.

          The car moves slowly down the highway with a line of cars waiting

          behind them.

          FADE OUT.
