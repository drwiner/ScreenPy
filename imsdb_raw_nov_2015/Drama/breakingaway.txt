                         FADE IN

          EXT. QUARRY OUTSKIRTS - DAY 1

          A narrow dirt road totally surrounded by thick vegetation.

          Here and there we see a huge block of stone blocking the

          road. The sun is shining but it has a hard time making it

          through the foliage. In the distance we see four guys

          walking TOWARD the CAMERA. There is a swagger to their

          walk. MIIi12 is singing. The others are humming along. The

          melody of the song of "0 Bury Me Not On the Lone Prairie"

          but it's a loose version.

                         MIME

          AND WHEN I DIE...WON'T YOU BURY ME

          ON THE"PARKING LOT OF THE A AND P

          BLOW OUT THE CANDLES AND BLOW OUT TIE LAMPS

          AND LIGHT MY PYRE WITH MY TRADING STAMPS

          I HAD TWO BOOKS BUT I NEEDED THREE R

          TO DELIVER ME FROM THE A AND P.

          I HAD THREE BOOKS BUT I NEEDED FOUR

          TO GO TO HEAVEN AND REDEEM MY SOUL.

          By this time the four are in front of the CAMERA. Mike is

          handsome and well built. CYRIL is tall and skinny. MOOCHER

          is very short. DAVE, hanging back a little, is carrying a

          large trophy.

                         DAVE

          Bravo, Mike! Bravo! Bellisimot

                         CYRIL

          Did you really make all that up?

          They pass.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE

          The presence of the quarry is felt much stronger now. More

          and more blocks of cut stone appear. The guys are dwarfed

          by them. They have to climb over some.

                         MIKE

          I sent away for this stuff from

          Wyoming. It'll tell you everything.

          Since you don't believe me maybe

          you'll believe it when you see it.

                         CYRIL

          And we'd work on the same ranch

          and sleep in the bunkhouse

          together, eh?

          That's the whole point.

          I always miss the whole point.

                         MOOCHER

          It'd be nice to have a paying

          Job again, that's for sure.

                         DAVE

          Niente laborare. Niente mangare.

                         MIKE

          What's that mean?

                         DAVE

          You don't work. You don't eat.

                         CYRIL

          That's a terrible thing to say.

          MED. SHOT

          The quarries are felt even more now. Walls of stone rise

          up around the guys.

                         CYRIL

          Are you really going to shave

          your legs?

                         DAVE

          Certo. All the Italians do it.

                         MIKE

          That's some country. The women

          don't shave theirs.

                         CYRIL

          STOP!

          (pauses as if

                         THUNDERSTRUCK;

          hand on heart)

          It was somewhere along here that

          I lost all interest in life. Ah,

          right over there. I.saw

          Dolores Reineke and fat Marvin.

          Why? Why Dolores?

                         MOOCHER

          They're married now.

          You see what I saved you from,

          Cyril. Had I not told you about

          the two of them you never would

          have followed them out here.

                         CYRIL-

          Thank you, Mike. You made me

          lose all interest in life and

          I'm grateful.

                         MIKE

          My brother says he saw you and

          Nancy. Moocher.

          When?

                         MIKE

          Last Friday?

                         MOOCHER

          Wasn't me. I'm not seeing her

          anymore.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE

          They are now standing above a huge pool of water with sheer

          cliffs on three sides. Abandoned derricks loom in the

          distance. Dave is now humming softly a Neapolitan song.

          They begin the descent.

                         CYRIL

          I kind of miss school. You know.

          This will be the first time nobody's

          going to ask us to write a theme

          about how we spent our summer.

                         MIKE

          Remember the Tomb of the

          Unknown Substitute Teacher.

                         MOOCHER

          When you're sixteen they call it

          sweet sixteen. When you're eighteen

          you get to drink, see dirty movies

          and vote. But what the hell do you

          do when you're nineteen.

          My dad says Jesus never went

          further than fifty miles from

          his home.

          Mike is skipping down the rocks toward the water, taking

          clothes off as he does. The rest follow.

                         MIKE

          And look what happened to him.

          Mike jumps into the water. Moocher and Cyril follow. Dave

          looks on.

          The guys are swimming. Dave is holding his trophy casually,

          enjoying the beautiful day. He pulls out a little

          Italian Phrase Book. Finds what he wants.

                         DAVE

          Oggi fa bello,-non e vero?

          C'mon in.

                         DAVE

          I read where this Italian coach

          said you should never swim after

          a race.

                         CYRIL

          Who's swimming? I'm taking a

          leak.

          Moocher and Mike splash water at him and swim away.

          ROCKS BY THE WATER 1-B

          All four guys are sunbathing looking at the water. Deep X

          down, at the bottom of the quarry hole we see an old icebox.

          Mike is staring at it. The mood is one of total relaxation.

                         MIRE

          Aren't you glad we got fired from

          The A and P. Right now we'd be X

          working.

                         MOOCHER

          We didn't get fired. You got-

          fired. We quit.

                         MIKE

          One for all and all for one.

                         MOOCHER

          You know what I'd like to be?

          Smart.

                         CYRIL

          A cartoon of some kind. Man, X

          that'd be great. Like when they

          get hit on their head with a

          frying pan and their head looks

          like a frying pan-with a handle

          and everything. And then they go

          b-r-r-r.

          (shakes his head)

          And their head comes back to

          normal. That'd be great..

                         MIKE

          How come you're so stupid, Cyril.

                         CYRIL

          I don't know. I think I have

          a dumb heredity. What's your

          excuse, Mike?

          Mike hits him hard on the arm. Cyril winces. Mike stands up.

          He makes sure they're all watching and dives in. The guys

          talk as they follow his progress.

                         DAVE

          You hear from your folks, Moocher?

          Yeah, my Dad called. He says

          there's a lot more jobs in'Chicago.

          He hasn't got anything yet.

          Mike has reached the icebox. He opens the door. Goes in.

          Shuts the door.

                         MOOCHER

          He wanted to know if the house

          was sold. They could use the

          money.

                         DAVE

          You can come and live with me

          when it's sold. In Italy

          everybody lives together.

          All three of them are getting concerned about Mike.

                         MOOCHER

          Ever since you won that Italian X

          bike you've been acting weird. You

          really think you are Italian.

                         CYRIL

          I .wouldn't mind thinking I was

          s omebody myself.

          All three of them stand up.

                         MOOCHER

          Maybe the door is stuck. God

          dammit!

          Moocher dives in. Dave and Cyril follow. Moocher swims

          down to the icebox, forces the door open. They surface.

          As soon as they hit the surface we hear:

          They see Mike standing on top of the rock above them.

                         MIKE

          It's got no back on it!

          He laughs triumphantly. He's ready to dive in again when he

          pauses and looks. High above where he stands on the other

          side of the quarry hole, we see several figures. The guys

          are swimming toward the rocks and looking at the figures too.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE

          Dave, Moocher and Cyril are standing on the rocks below Mike.

          Mike is still on top of the rock. High above him are the

          College Kids. Three guys and three girls. One of the guys

          is standing on the ledge above the water. Our guys are

          looking at the College Kid on the ledge. He seems intent

          on diving into the water. It's a distance of at least eighty

          feet. He pushes off and dives in executing a beautiful

          somersault into a swan dive.

          CLOSEUP - OUR GUYS

          They are stunned.

          CLOSEUP - MIKE

          He's obviously envious.. He looks from the diver toward the

          guys and seems to feel his position undermined.

          Huge modern structures are looming in the distance in stark

          contrast to the town we just passed through. Mike's car-is

          speeding toward them. X

          EXT. CAMPUS - DAY 7

          Mike's car turns into a street called Fraternity Row.- Most

          of the fraternities and sororities-are located along this

          stretch. Neat lawns line the area. The houses are enormous:

          an architectural mixture of old manor house and modern motel.

          The college kids are outside on the lawns. Some are reading.

          Girls in bikinis sunbathing. Guys washing their cars. Some

          other guys passing the football around. Transistor radios

          playing. Mike drives slowly.

          INT. MIKE'S CAR

          All the guys are looking out of the windows as if they were

          in a museum. Mike looks at the expensive cars along the way.

          Cyril looks at the Girls in bikinis. Moocher looks at the

          huge well-built guys. Dave just looks.

          I wonder what it's like to kiss

          a coed. I wonder about it a lot.

          Ahead of Mike's car we see two Guys and two Girls playing

          Frisbee. They are standing on the lawns and throwing the

          Frisbee to each other across the street. Mike's car is

          moving slowly forward when an ill-thrown Frisbee lands on

          the street. Mike sees it and speeds up. A Girl is running

          to get it but Mike gets there first and runs over it. Dave

          gets a quick look at the Girl as she stops"suddenly to keep

          from getting hit. The two college Guys run out and give'

          Mike the finger. He sees them in the rearview mirror.

                         MIKE

          Hey, those bastards are giving

          us the finger.

          He slams on the brakes.

                         MOOCHER

          Hey, c'mon, Mike. We're on

          their turf.

          Dave is looking back at the Girl. The two Guys are

          challenging Mike, motioning to him to come back. The two

          Girls are trying to talk them out of it. Mike-is gunning

          the car.

                         MIKE

          They think they own the place.

                         MOOCHER

          They do.

                         CYRIL

          Besides, you've humiliated them

          enough. In ancient Japan when

          you ran over a samurai's Frisbee

          he had to commit suicide.

          Just as he laughs Mike shifts the car in reverse. The

          two Guys and Girls are standing in the middle of the road.

          The Guys are coming forward thinking Mike's going to stop,

          but Mike has no intention of stopping. The Girls and the

          Guys split as Mike's car roars between them. Once again

          Dave catches a fleeting glimpse of the Girl. Having

          scattered them, Mike makes a U-turn and drives away in

          the direction he came from.

          he cuts in front of them. The horns blow. The brakes

          He cuts through the pedestrians crossing the street

          appears in the FRAME and snatches it away from him. It's

          Dave, riding away with the piece of paper in his hand. The

          crosses on the red light. Once again he's nearly hit by

          several cars. He follows Katherine up the hill leading to

          Fraternity Row. He overtakes her just as. she's about to

          turn into the drive leading to her sorority. But Dave is

          there on her right preventing her-from turning. She too

          almost hits him. She slams on her brakes. Dave slams on

          his. They come to a dead stop.

          Signorina...You...

          He's handing her the paper but then he pauses and pulls it

          back just as she's about to take it. He wipes the saliva

          off the paper on his jersey, and then gives it to her.

                         DAVE

          It is yours...no?

          She takes the paper and smiles. Then she laughs.

          Dave is just looking at her. She's never seen anyone look

          at her quite like that. She's a bit confused.

          We see Moocher from the back. He stops suddenly when he

          hears the word "shorty." He turns around slowly. He looks

          at the Owner. He wraps the rag around his fist. And then,

          with a sudden explosive movement, he punches the clock with

          his fist, knocking it off the wall.

                         MOOCHER

          How's that?

          He tosses the sponge aside and walks out shaking the pain

          from his fist.

          He hears the music of Italy in his soul. As he's crossing

          very neurotic. He's listening to the music filtering in from

          Dave's room.

          MR. BLASE

          I want an answer, Evelyn.

          What're we going to do with

          him?

          MRS. BLASE

          I don't know, dear. I suppose

          we could strangle him while

          he's asleep.

          MR. BLASE

          That's not funny, Evelyn.

          MRS. BLASE

          Why don't you talk to him.

          MR. BLASE

          I'm afraid to talk to him. I'm

          afraid to look at him. I'm

          afraid if I did, I'd see his

          eyes twirling like pinwheels.

          Mrs. Blase brings the fries.

          MRS. BLASE

          The only reason I'm giving you

          these French fries is because

          you promised to calm down.

          Don't expect to get them

          again.

          Mr. Blase is still annoyed by Dave's music.

          MR. BLASE

          I can't eat while that noise

          is on.

          He gets up and heads toward Dave's room. Dave appears

          dressed for riding. They cross paths. Mrs. Blase goes to

          wash the pan in the sink. Dave sees the French fries on - X

          the table. He sits down and starts eating them. The

          music stops. Mrs. Blase turns around and sees Dave eating

          the French fries. She wants to say something. Mr. Blase

          reappears and sees Dave eating his fries.

          Mr. Blase pulls into the parking lot and gets out. He looks

          at the shop. The NOISE of MACHINERY is HEARD from the huge

          building. The NOISE gets LOUDER as Mr. Blase walks toward

          it, trying to avoid stepping into the Limestone dust with his

          polished shoes, but the dust is everywhere.

          EXT. SHOP ENTRANCE 58-C

          Several CUTTERS are having lunch. They are eating heartily

          right outside the shop. The NOISE is EVEN LOUDER but they

          don't seem to be bothered by it. One of them looks.

                         CUTTER ONE

          Well, look who's back.

          He has to shout to be heard. The others look.

          ANGLE ON MR. BLASE

          He's glad to be back but he's also trying to keep a little

          distance as if proud of how far he had come in life. He

          smiles and waves grandly, his suit and tie sticking out in

          this surrounding.

          They all laugh and get up to greet him. All except one

          younger man who continues sitting and eating. The Cutters

          slap Mr. Blase on the back, their dusty hands leaving dusty

          I left off.

          The entrance to the shop draws him forward. A couple of the

          Cutters accompany him. He takes half of a sandwich from one

          of them. It's lunch hour at the shop and the old instincts

          are coming back.

          The NOISE is now DEAFENING. Dust is everywhere and slowly

          through the dust we see men working, pausing only long enough

          to smile and wave at Mr. Blase. Mr. Blase is finishing off

          his sandwich just like the Cutter next to him who walks to

          his place leaving Mr. Blase, who has no place here, to wonder.

          I say this: We rednecks are

          few. Paleface college students

          are many. I counsel peace.

          Mike's car is moving through the campus. They're all looking

          Mike's car is parked next to a grassy field. They're all

          watching cars going by. Cyril shakes his head. On the field

          a bunch of College Kids are gathering for a game of football.

          I really thought I was a great

          quarterback in high school. I

          still think so. I can't even

          bring myself to light a cigarette

          'cause I keep thinking I should-

          stay in shape. And you know what

          gets me. Living here and reading

          in the papers how some hotshot kid

          is the new star on the college team.

          Every year there'll be a new one and

          it's never going to be me. I'll

          just be Mike. Twenty-year-old Mike.

          Thirty-year-old Mike. Old mean old

          man Mike. But the college kids will

          never get old...out of shape...'cause

          new ones come every year. And they'll

          keep calling us 'cutters.' To them

          it's a dirty word but to me it'll

          just be something else I never got

          a chance to be.

          He falls silent and sticks a cigarette in his mouth. His

          genuine confession has caught everybody,. including himself,

          off guard. The guys look at him with sympathy and under-

          standing but Mike doesn't like that. He starts the car up.

          Rod and his Girl are looking for a place to sit. Seeing no

          empty spots in the area they head toward the area where Dave

          and Katherine are sitting. Just as they're about to turn the

          corner and probably see them somebody gets up and Rod takes

          the table.

          Certo, I miss. Just like you

          miss your Mama and Papa.

          I hardly miss them. I went as

          far as I could to get away from

          them.

                         DAVE

          Katherine is near tears. The homelife Dave's describing is

          obviously not hers. Not wanting to cry she takes out a

          cigarette and a lighter and Dave, being a continental

          gentleman, takes the lighter from her. He doesn't know what

          to make of it. He fiddles with it and then strikes and a

          huge jet of flame shoots out. Dave-is frightened. He lets

          go of the button, but the lighter is stuck and the flame is

          still burning., He blows'on it. He shakes it. Katherine

          starts laughing. Finally, in desperation Dave pours coffee

          on the lighter and it goes out.

          we have decided to expand the

          field of this year's Little 500

          to include a team from the town.

          I don't want him selling used

          Why not? If it's good enough

          Damn right it's good enough for

          me. But...I don't need help.

          Besides...he'd ruin me if I hired

          him. A weirdo like that...

          getting wet. He looks tired. He's thinking of the Italians.

          As he turns his legs we see: THE PICTURE OF THE ITALIANS

          AROUND EACH OTHER, SMILING. Then we see another picture,

          Dave is in the middle of the Italians. He has his arms

          The Italians appear first.. They look back over their

          shoulders and see nobody there. They nod to each other and

          continue over the crest, shifting into a higher gear for the

          descent. Dave and three riders appear over the crest. Dave

          is in the lead. As he goes over the crest, he shifts gears

          and starts to sprint. The other riders cannot match him.

                         CUT TO:

          ANGLE ON ITALIANS

          They are bent over their frames in their descent positions.

          Their knees and elbows are tucked in and they are coasting

          down the hill.

          He's in the similar position only he's not coasting. He's

          They are still in their descent. The hill is steep and they

          are going very fast. Suddenly, Dave, bent over and breathing

          hard appears in the FRAME. He tries to appear that he's not

          tired. He smiles.

                         DAVE

          Buon giorno. Come sta?

          The Italians look stunned. The 1ST ITALIAN is annoyed. The

          ZTH ITALIAN seems amused.

          FRONT SHOT - THE FLATS 135

          The Italians are riding hard. The effort is showing on their

          faces. Dave is behind them. He too is tired. But when the

          1st Italian looks back to see how Dave is doing Dave manages

          to smile. This seems to "psyche" the lst Italian out. He

          gestures angrily to Dave to take his turn up front. Dave is

          thrilled at the command. He moves to the front. The

          following conversations will have to be subtitled.

                         DAVE

          He's up front breaking wind for the others. He's working

          hard and he's tired. The Italians behind him are likewise.

          Dave swings off to let another rider pull in front. As he

          does Dave once again smiles. He doesn't do this to fool

          them. He's just thrilled to be in their company.

          But the lst Italian is upset. He wants to drop Dave. But

          he doesn't want to kill himself doing it. He's thinking.

          ANGLE ON THE HILL 136

          The Italians are switching off as they begin another ascent.

          It's Dave's turn to take the lead. As he goes up front the

          1st Italian reaches in and pushes Dave's lever all the way

          forward. This suddenly shifts Dave into a very high gear.

          He can hardly turn the cranks. The 1st Italian smiles at him.

                         1ST ITALIAN

                         MI SCUSII

          (Excuse me!)

          He takes off. The other three follow him while Dave fumbles

          around to get back in the right gear.

          He does not look happy. The CAMERA MOVES BACK and we SEE

          Dave at the front again.

          CLOSEUP - DAVE

          He's getting a little more serious. He sees a huge pothole

          in front of him. He rides right toward it and then at the

          last second he jerks his bike aside. The 1st Italian goes

          right over the pothole. He's jarred and angry. Dave looks

          back. Smiles.

                         DAVE

          Mi scusi!

          The 4th Italian appreciates this little reversal. The

          lst Italian is getting a brutal look in his face.

          All five of them are continually taking turns being up front.

          They are approaching a small hill. The lst Italian points

          to the hill. Dave is too exhausted now to fake any smiles.

          The pace is as hard as it's been.

          FADE THROUGH TO:

          ANGLE ON THE CREST OF THE HILL 139

          Dave is up front.

          Behind him we see the 2ND ITALIAN taking out his pump. Dave

          pulls off to let him take the lead but as he does the

          lst Italian pulls up behind him to block his way back. The

          3RD ITALIAN sprints up front to block his way forward. Dave

          is trapped. The 3rd Italian puts on his brakes. Dave puts

          on his to avoid running into him. As his speed slows down

          the 2nd Italian sticks his pump into Dave's rear wheel. Dave

          sees all this. In the split second that it takes, he sees

          it all. His wheel collapses and Dave tumbles off the road

          falling down the steep grade. The Italians ride off. The

          4th Italian slows down a little to look at Dave. He seems

          genuinely sorry about what happened but he too continues.

          He shouts after his teammates. He's a little angry.

          EXT. RACE FINISH 140

          The tour Italians are sprinting toward the finish line. A

          large "FINISH" sign flutters in the breeze. The 4th Italian

          wins and as he does he turns and fives the "Italian finger"

          to his three buddies. He's still angry at them. Cyril,

          Mike and Moocher look for Dave. The crowd is cheering.

          EXT. ROAD - DAY 140-A

          All the guys are riding in silence. Dave is crushed by his

          shattered Italian dream. Mendelsohn's Italian Symphony is

          playing: the second movement. They drive past the finish

          line of the race. The big cloth sign "FINISH" is still up

          fluttering in the wind. A man is taking it down. Everybody

          else is gone. Dave looks on heartbroken.

          The three black riders look at each other.. They need a new

          plan, they seem to be thinking.

                         CUT TO:

          ANGLE ON PIT AREA NUMBER 1

          Rod and his teammates are watching Dave's progress. They

          shake their heads. He can't possibly catch up.

          ANGLE ON THE LEAD PACK

          Now all three riders are looking back over their shoulders.

          They see Dave coming on.

                         CUT TO:

          ANGLE ON PIT AREA NUMBER 1

          Rod is getting ready to take an exchange for his final sprint.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE

          We see the black sprinter in Pit area 4 getting ready to take

          an exchange too. He and Rod look at each other.

          MED. SHOT

          Rod and. the black sprinter get their bikes at the same time

          and start to accelerate.

          He passes the third rider from the lead group. Ahead of him

          ANGLE ON THE LAP CHART

          It shows one lap to go. A man is waving a flag signaling the

          last lap. Rod and the black guy go past him. Dave is behind

          them and gaining.

                         CUT TO:

          ANGLE ON DAVE

          He sees them right in front of him. The Italian music is

          still playing as he catches up to them and pulls up behind

          Rod who's riding on the inside. They are going around the

          curve. Rod drifts out a bit and that's all the room that

          Dave needs. He takes the inside edge as they come around

          for the final stretch. All three of them stand up and begin

          their final sprint. It looks dead even as they're

          approaching the finish line. A man is waving the checkered

          flag. Then, with about forty yards to go, Dave suddenly

          explodes ahead and wins by an inch or so. He raises his arms

          in the air.

                         NEW ANGLE

          Cyril, Moocher and Mike are running toward Dave. They are

          Jubilant. They jump on Dave knocking him down. Mike's'

          brother runs up and...

          CLOSEUP - THE BROTHERS

          There's a look of family pride as they embrace.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE

          Nancy runs up to Moocher. She's still wearing her waitress

          uniform. She practically lifts him off the ground. Dave's

          parents rush past them. Everybody is shouting. The crowd

          is cheering. Confetti is falling.

          CLOSEUP - CYRIL

          He's happy but he feels left out. Everybody is hugging and

          'getting hugged except for him.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE

          Katherine is watching the celebration. She looks at Dave and

          then she looks at Rod not far away. Then she turns slowly

          and leaves-bidding a farewell, in a way, to a portion of her

          life.

          Dave and his parents are walking off. Mike and his brother

          are arm in arm. Moocher and Nancy are holding hands and

          going their way.

          CLOSEUP - CYRIL

          He's-holding the four trophies they won. He is trying to

          swagger but he doesn't know where to go. The guys seem to

          be going-in separate directions and he doesn't know whom to

          follow. The CAMERA PULLS BACK FROM him. Confetti is falling

          everywhere. Wind is blowing it around the stadium.

          FADE THROUGH TO:

          ANGLE ON TREES 178

          The branches are swaying in the wind. Leaves are golden

          yellow and falling off, swirling through the air, falling

          on the road. Mike's car goes through.the leaves as he drives

          up an entrance ramp onto a throughway.

          INT. MIL'S CAR - DAY 178-A

          He's wearing.a cowboy hat. Cigarette is in his. mouth. He

          looks back at a sign: "YOU ARE NOW LEAVING BLOOMINGTON."

          He lights his cigarette. A highway stretches in front of him.

          EXT. MR. BLASE' S CAR LOT - DAY

          It's been retitled "CUTTER CARS LTD." Mrs. Blase, quite

          pregnant now, is sweeping the leaves. Mr. Blase is getting

          on the bike ready to leave.

          EXT. CAMPUS - DAY 179

          ,The leaves are falling off here too and blowing in the wind.

          Students are going to and from classes. We see Dave among

          them pushing his bike along. He's wearing a Phi Kappa Psi

          jacket.

          CLOSEUP - DAVE

          He looks quite collegiate and he seems to know it. But it's

          fall and fall makes you think of other days and Dave seems

          to be doing just that. A GIRL walks up to him. She seems

          quite lost. She speaks with a definite French accent.

                         GIRL

          Pardon...do you know where is

          the office of the Pursar.

          Dave looks at her. Some of his collegiate exterior fades as

          he smiles at her.

          Bursar's office.

                         GIRL

          Oui, Bursar.

          ANGLE ON MR. BLASE ON A BICYCLE 180

          He's riding through the campus, looking around. His son goes

          to school and he looks and feels that he has a right to be

          there.

                         CUT TO:

          ANGLE ON DAVE AND THE GIRL

          They're riding double on Dave's bicycle. She's carrying his

          books. The book on top is Beginning French.

                         DAVE

          French is my major. It's just my

          first year, of course. Have you

          ever seen Le Tour de France?

          He gives it his best French accent.

                         GIRL

          No.

                         DAVE

          Not Oh, mon Dieu. But the

          French riders... they are the

          bestl Pouladoirl Anquetill

          Not only his accent, but his gestures are becoming French.

          Riding toward him on his bike is Mr. Blase. He sees Dave

          and waves.

          MR. BLASE

          Hello there, big shot.

                         DAVE

          Bon jour, Papa.

          They pass.

          Mr. Blase turns and looks back. His face registers mixed

          emotions, but the overriding one is one of acceptance. Dave

          turns to the girl.

                         DAVE

          Je m'appelle...

          We FREEZE ON his French gesture.
