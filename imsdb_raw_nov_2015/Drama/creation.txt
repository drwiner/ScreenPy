   Note:

   Our story alternates between Past and Present

   "Present" means the fall of 1858 when Darwin was 49. The

   children are: Etty (15) George (14) Betty (11) Franky (10)

   Lenny (8) and Horace (6).

   "Past" means the summer of 1850, when Darwin was 41. The

   children are: Willy (11), Annie (9) Etty (6) George (5),

   Betty (3) Franky (2y) and baby Lenny.

1   INT. DARK ROOM. THE PAST. DAY                                  1

    In darkness, chemicals wash over a copper plate. Strange

    silvery patterns evolve in the half-light.

2   EXT. TERRA DEL FUEGO. DAY                                      2

    Our POV rotates downwards onto an irregular shape.

    This shape is grey-green and crammed with detail which

    emerges as we draw close - like a continent seen from outer

    space.

    A fruit fly lands on it and we now recognise the shape as a

    patch of lichen.

    A number of other fruit flies are grazing there.

    Wider. The lichen is on a rock. A   black lizard climbs over

    the horizon - stalking flies.

    A slow advance. A sudden rush. A fly is snapped up and

    mashed between toothless gums.

    The lizard is fixing its beady gaze on the next potential

    victim when...

    A shadow falls, the lizard tries to flee. A seabird grabs

    the lizard in its claws. Death is sudden and bloody.

    The bird settles to eat.

    Whizz...Thunk. A sharpened stick flies out of nowhere and

    impales the bird through its wing.

    The wounded bird falls between boulders, flapping

    helplessly.

    The rest of the flock take to their air, calling and

    wheeling as...

    A crowd of local savages come racing over the larger

    horizon of the rocks armed with primitive bows and arrows,

    spears, rocks and throwing-sticks...

    A child grabs the injured bird and kills it.

    An adult biffs the child on the head and steals the bird.

    The rest of the savages leap among the jagged rocks smiting

    each other, shouting and snarling among the whirling flock

    of birds.

    AND WE CUT TO

                                                              2

3   EXT. COASTLINE. DAY                                           3

    A POV shot through a telescope: The whirling birds the

    strange half-animal forms of the savages.

    The whole scene is jerky, out of focus and inaudible at

    this great distance like a very old silent movie.

                        CHARLES DARWIN (V.O.)

              In Terra del Fuego. The "land of

              fire" - A blighted and loveless

              country on the earths furthest

              rim - there lives a community of

              the dirtiest, the rudest, the

              least civilised beings you can

              imagine.

    The telescope focusses. The image becomes a little clearer

4   EXT. CLIFF TOP. DAY                                           4

    The flock of boobies fly out to sea.

    The savages follow as far as the top of the cliffs, where

    they stop in sudden amazement, staring at a distant sailing

    ship.

                        DARWIN (V.O.)

              They were all completely naked,

              the men as well as the women,

              with hair down to their bottoms.

              They spoke in grunts and they

              never washed their hands and

              faces! In many respects they

              resembled wild animals, except

              that animals are kinder to their

              children.

    A savage child makes a comment and gets biffed on the head

    again.

    Strange, foreign cries of the sailors are faintly audible

    over the water, as the anchor is dropped with a rattle and

    a splash. A small boat is lowered.

                        DARWIN

              One day, Captain Fitzroy went

              ashore to meet them.

    The slow rhythm of the oars.

    Sailors and savages clutch their weapons, watching each

    other in breathless anticipation.

5   INT. DAGUERROTYPE STUDIO. THE PAST. DAY.                      5

    A door opens and a figure in black, hurries past, clutching

    a number of prepared photographic plates in their light

    proof cases.

                        TECHNICIAN

              Not long now. I shall be with you

              immediately...

    ANNIE DARWIN, wearing in a checkered dress, aged about 9

    years old, sits looking straight at camera.

    She has short hair and a pretty oval face

    On her lap there is a posy of artificial flowers, in the

    background an improbable vista of jagged mountain.

                        PHOTOGRAPHER (O.S.)

              Ready now. Very still please.

                        ANNIE

              Will this hurt, papa?

                        DARWIN

              No. It is only a beam of light.

                        ANNIE

              How can light make a picture.

                         DARWIN

              Well they prepare a copper plate

              with chemicals on it. The

              chemicals are sort of energized

              by the light reflecting off your

              face.

              Then silver sticks onto the plate

              according to where the light is

              brightest.

                        ANNIE

              Betty was worried it would hurt.

              ....What a little duck she is.

                        DARWIN

              So as I was saying, Captain

              Fitzroy went ashore to interview

              the Fuegans....

6   EXT. SHORE. TIERRA DEL FUEGO. DAY                             6

    Waves lap on the black pebbly beach, where a young naval

    captain FITZROY with mutton chop sideboards disembarks

    lightly from his jolly-boat.

                                                              4

                        DARWIN (V.O.)

              After some discussion persuaded

              three of the savages` children to

              come home with him.

    The "discussion" is more in the nature of heated bargaining

    for slaves.

    Fitzroy finally produces enough cloth and axe-heads to

    secure the deal.

    The unwilling children pushed away by their parents and

    grabbed by sailors who bundle them, biting crying and

    kicking, into the waiting boat.

                        DARWIN (V.O.)

              Their names were Jemmy Buttons,

              York Minster and Fuegia Basket.

7   INT. BELOW DECKS. DAY.                                        7

    Below decks: a slapstick struggle with soap and scrubbing

    brushes - much biting kicking and howling - as sailors

    scrub the children clean.

                        SAILORS

              Ow! Shite! Hold still ye maggot!

                        DARWIN

              The captain had them washed and

              got their hair cut, then dressed

              them in proper clothes, and

              taught them proper table manners.

8   INT. CAPTAIN'S CABIN.    DAY                                  8

    The children, cleaned and dressed,   seem happy enough in

    their new situation.

    They sit at the captain's table clumsily sawing with a

    knife and chasing Brussel sprouts around a plate with their

    cutlery.

    A sprout shoots off the table

9   EXT. SHIP'S DECK. DAY                                         9

    Splosh! A weighted canvas body bag is tipped overboard.

    The rough unshaven seamen crew all remove their hats, some

    of them cry openly.

                                                               5

                         DARWIN

               York Minster died of the smallpox

               but the other two learned English

               and went to meet the queen.

10   EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE. DAY                                   10

     A fanfare as the gates swing open as a coach-and-four

     rattles through.

11   INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE. DAY                                   11

     Jemmy Buttons, looking very smart in velvet suit with

     silver buttons gives proper bow and shakes the Royal hand.

     Fuegia Basket curtsies.

     Queen Victoria remains out of shot but her attendants hand

     out presents off a purple silk cushion: A Bible for Fuegia

     and a telescope for Jemmy

12   EXT. SHORE OF TIERRA DEL FUEGO. DAY.                          12

     Hairy savages reassemble on the cliff tops

                         DARWIN

               Two years later. Captain Fitzroy

               and I took them back, in the

               company of a young Parson, hoping

               they would bring the other

               savages to god and to teach the

               others by example.

     The hairy savages squint from the cliffs to sea....

     Another boat, the Beagle, has anchored in their bay.

     Captain Fitzroy is being rowed ashore with Darwin, plus a

     very young parson and the two young Fuegans, who are happy

     and agitated to see their homeland again.

                         DARWIN

               And what do you think happened?

13   INT. DAGUERROTYPE STUDIO. THE PAST. DAY.                      13

     Annie suspects there is a joke coming and cant help her

     mouth from twitching the corners.

                         DARWIN

                   (laughing)

               Correct! A complete and total

               failure!

                                                              6

14   EXT. ROCKY CREVICES. TERRA DEL FUEGO. DAY                    14

     At the first sight of their countrymen, Jemmy and Fuegia

     rip off their clothes, drop the bible and the telescope,

     and run to join them, yelling like nut-cases.

                           HAIRY SAVAGES

               YAAAAAH!!

                         JEMMY/ FUEGIA

               Yaah!! Yahh!!

     The benighted young parson scrambles after them, collecting

     their discarded garments from among the rain-swept rocks.

                         PARSON

               Jemmy! Fuegia

     The telescope is smashed. The Bible lies abandoned - the

     wind catching its soggy pages and whirling them off in the

     storm.

15   INT. DAGUERROTYPE STUDIO. DAY.                               15

     Darwin still laughing, dabs his eyes

                         ANNIE

                   (laughing)

               Yaaah!

     The photographer disappears behind black curtains.

                         TECHNICIAN

               Very still now. No more talking

               please

     Annie composes her face in an expression of angelic

     seriousness.

     A glass dome above her head glows snapdragon blue

     Close on Darwin watching his daughter, his eyes still damp

     with tears of laughter.

     Electricity hums. The strange blue light glows brighter,

     brighter... Brighter.

     The image of his daughter imprints on Darwin's memory. Just

     so. Forever.

16   INT. DOWN HOUSE. DINING ROOM. THE PRESENT. EVENING.          16

     Servants are laying a table for dinner

     Gas lamps and the coal fire struggle to illuminate the

     lofty room.

                                                          7

Mrs Davies the Welsh cook, bangs the dinner gong and shouts

across the darkening garden outside.

                    MR DAVIES (O.S.)

          Children! Franky! Horace! Dinner!

Darwins attractive wife Emma adjusts the lamps and the boys

run in, Franky aged 10 Lenny aged 8 Horace aged 6.

                       LENNY

          Mama mama.

                    EMMA

          Yes. What is it

                    LENNY

          Horace says he's six feet tall.

                    EMMA

          Have you all washed your hands.

                    HORACE

          He said I have to be or I can't

          join the army.

                    EMMA

          First things first. An officer

          must always tuck his shirt in.

Their elder sisters Betty and Etty take their places at

table

                    BETTY

          The boys made a camp with a camp-

          fire

                       LENNY

          Oh! Sneak!

                    EMMA

          Where's the campfire.

                    BETTY

          In the summer house but Brodie

          put it out.

Parslow enters with the turreen

                    EMMA

          Thank-you Parslow. Where is Mr

          Darwin?

                    PARSLOW

          He was killing pigeons Ma'am

                    EMMA

          Will everybody sit down please.

                                                       8

As they are pulling in their chairs, Darwin enters, drying

his hands on his trousers.

He's aged ten years since we last saw him and has lost his

former air of gaiety.

He sits, with a distracted nod to the family.

                    PARSLOW

          Soup du jour, sir

The children smile at Parslow's air of earnest formality

but the atmosphere even among the younger kids is sombre

and subdued.

                    DARWIN

          Thank you Parslow

He butters some bread and starts eating. Emma clears her

throat.

                    DARWIN.

          Oh.

The children bow their heads. The bread stick in darwins

mouth. Emma says grace.

                    EMMA

          Lord God who watches over all

          that we do. Bless this family and

          the food we eat. In Jesus name.

          Amen.

Everyone repeats the "Amen" except Darwin.

                    EMMA

          I hear Mr Hooker is coming

          tomorrow.

The children prick up their ears at this. They like Hooker

                    DARWIN

          He won't stay long.

                    EMMA

          Did he say what it was about?

                    DARWIN

          I think this is not the time to

          discuss it.

                    EMMA

          Maybe the time to discuss it was

          before you invited him.

                    DARWIN

          He sent a telegram. I'm sorry if

          it inconveniences you.

                                                               9

     Emma purses her lips and turns her attention back to the

     children

                         EMMA

               Eat your soup now.

     Darwin takes a couple of spoonfuls, pauses, as a wave of

     nausea sweeps over him, then pushes away the dish.

                          DARWIN

                    (To Parslow)

               Tell Mr Davies it was delicious,

               but my stomach is not quite right

               yet.

                    (To Emma)

               Excuse me.

     He gets up and leaves. As soon as he has gone, the children

     natural talkativeness reasserts itself.

                         CHILDREN

               Can we take Mr Hooker to the

               Chalk pits. Why can't he stay.

               Can we pick blackberries?

                         EMMA

               I think he is just here to work

17   EXT. DOWN HOUSE. DARWIN'S STUDY. THE PRESENT. NIGHT.          17

     A branch taps gently against the window pain, like an

     insistent guest demanding to be admitted.

     The coal fire burns low in the grate - wind in the chimney

     rattling the damper

     Firelight flickers on a collection of finches in a glass

     case, on a bird skeleton, on a fossil, and on numerous

     specimen bottles containing the fleshy parts of barnacles

     preserved in spirit-of-wine.

     Darwin sits immobile in his chair, regarding a locked,

     black lacquered steel trunk, on the floor under his work

     table.

     A voice speaks behind him.

                         ANNIE

               Aren't you going to open it?

     He turns and sees her sitting on the day bed - the same

     little bright eyed girl from the daguerrotype studio.

     She's the same age as she was then and wearing the same

     checkered dress - though Darwin himself has aged ten years.

                                                              10

                          DARWIN

               Maybe best if I just burn the

               whole lot.

                         ANNIE

                   (horrified)

               No papa - You can't. I'm in it.

                         DARWIN

               Don't be absurd. Of course you're

               not.

                         ANNIE

               The story of me when I was small.

               You showed me the pages.

                          DARWIN

               Ah yes.

                         ANNIE

               "The natural History of babies"

               ...Remember?

                         DARWIN

               Of course I remember.

     He continues to stare at the shiny black box, his hand

     fluttering lightly - a nervous tic.

     Music seeps in - a soothing Chopin Nocturne and....

18   INT. DOWN HOUSE DRAWING ROOM.   THE PAST. NIGHT               18

     Darwin aged 40 - bright-eyed and inquisitive leans over to

     examine something, offering it his finger tip while making

     little tut tut tut noises.

     In the cot is a one-month old baby.

                         DARWIN

               Annie. Annie. Annie.

     The piano music continuing over, as her fist closes round

     the end of his finger, then tries to pull it towards her

     mouth.

     He pulls it away from her and she frowns.

     He offers it again and the tug of war becomes a game.

     Baby Annie laughs.

     Darwin writes something in his notebook. Then tucks his

     pencil behind his ear and tries out various facial

     expressions - scowling, smiling - to gauge the baby's

     response.

                                                           11

     Emma turns on the piano-stool.

                         EMMA

                   (affectionately)

               What are you doing?

                         DARWIN

               Just playing.

     She comes over and, leaning against him, reads from his

     notebook.

                         EMMA

               "Six weeks: Gurgles. Holds tight

               to my finger. Tries to suck.

               Smiles at my smile"

     The baby lets out a long yodel of pleasure

                         DARWIN

               I should add that she is musical.

                         EMMA

               I hope you do not plan to treat

               all our children as little

               animacules to be included in your

               experiments.

                         DARWIN

               Do you mean there will be more.

                         EMMA

               I assumed that's what you wanted.

               Of course, if the idea doesn't

               appeal then...

                         DARWIN

               Appeal? Dearest cousin. I am

               making plans for an army!

     He takes Emma in his arms. She gives a little squeak -

     caught off balance then laughing as he waltzes her around

     the room, singing.

19   EXT. WOODS AND MEADOW. THE PAST. DAY                        19

     An army of children - the Darwin family - run across the

     screen from left to right. The little kids first,

     scampering through the hay meadow off into the trees.

     Household servants follow, carrying blankets, hampers and

     parasols.

     The red haired Scottish nursemaid Brodie, shouts ahead to

     the little ones.

                                                            12

                         BRODIE

               Careful! Not too far ahead now.

     The children ignore her so she pick up her skirts and races

     after them.

     The Adults follow in their wake - Charles and Emma Darwin

     plus two younger men aged about 30 - Joe Hooker and the Rev

     Innes

20   EXT. RIVER BANK. THE PAST. DAY                               20

     They have set up their picnic on a river bank.

     Emma is reading.

     Joseph Hooker is teaching the boys to fish. He has

     spectacles and long wispy side-whiskers: a battered panama

     on his head and his trousers rolled up to his knees.

                         HOOKER

               Give it time to take a bite.

     The fishing float moves a little

                         HOOKER

               He's Nibbling. Nibbling. Oh

               Bother. No-one move.

     He's dropped his spectacles in the shallows.

     George (aged 5) feels a jerk on the line. He squeals and

     drops the rod. The fish takes off upriver. Will goes after

     the dropped rod.

     On shore, Annie runs up with a collecting box to show her

     father

                         ANNIE

               I've got one.

     She opens the box to show him a little black beetle.

     The local parson, Innes, inclines his head to inspect it

                         ANNIE

               What should I feed it?

                         MR INNES

               A leaf I should think. What plant

               did you find him on?

                         ANNIE

               In the mud under that log.

     Innes looks to Darwin for advice

                                                      13

                    MR INNES

          ...Or a piece of bark maybe.

Darwin peers at the insect

                    DARWIN

          Cycrus caraboides. You can see

          from the mandibles he's a hunter.

          He feeds on slugs and snails.

                    INNES

          Oh.

Annie runs off, calling to the other children

                    ANNIE

          Etty! Willy! Find me some slugs.

          He's hungry!

                    INNES

          When I said I knew something of

          insects.....

                    DARWIN

          Oh tush.... I studied Theology

          for a year but yet I know

          exceedingly little of the bible.

                    INNES

          Then once I am properly installed

          at Down I shall take pleasure in

          instructing you.

                     DARWIN

          I should look forward to that

          immensely.

Emma, knowing her husband's ambivalence towards religion,

casts him a slightly arch, amused look. Innes notices this,

though he pretends not to.

Hooker returns from the river, looking slightly damp, with

the rod which he has managed to retrieve

                    HOOKER

          Everyone's a bit wet. Sorry, but

          the fish are surely biting. More

          worms, boys, more worms.

George is looking under stones

                    HOOKER

          Try over there, Georgey, we've

          used all these ones up.

They move off, joining Annie and the other in their hunt

for crawling things. The air above them is heavy and

sparkling with pollen.

                                                           14

21   EXT. OCEAN. NIGHT                                            21

     A sailing ship sails past, trailing phosphorescence it its

     wake.

                         DARWIN (V.O.)

               On the Beagle, quite, often we

               would drop a flask in the ocean

               and find it teeming with living

               particles which glowed in the

               night

22   INT. SHIP'S CABIN. NIGHT                                     22

     The figure in silhouette of young Darwin inspects a flask

     of sea water, glowing in the darkness.

     He takes a few drops on a watch glass and places them on

     the illuminated stage of his microscope.

     Under the microscope, against a black background, millions

     of tiny swimming animals.

23   EXT. BY THE RIVER BANK. THE PAST. DAY                        23

     Cut to the air above the picnickers - alive with glittering

     particles - against the dark trees behind.

                         DARWIN

               ....so much beauty for so little

               purpose.

                         EMMA

               Surely not without purpose. They

               were helping to light the ship's

               way were they not.

     Darwin smiles at the idea, turns to Innes

                         DARWIN

               Are you familiar with the works

               of Thomas Malthus, Mr Innes?.

                          INNES

               He married his first cousin

               didn't he?

                         EMMA

               So did Charles.... So did I.

                         INNES

               Oh, I was not at all

               suggesting....

     Emma waves it away. Just teasing

                                                        15

                    DARWIN

          He made the point that if every

          trout, say, has a hundred

          offspring And so on and so on

          through the generations. Then the

          planet would be knee deep in

          trout in just a few decades.

                    INNES

          Of course most of the eggs are

          destroyed and eaten so the

          numbers remain stable. That is

          the beauty of God's plan.

Emma gives Darwin a "So there" look and hands Innes a

sandwich.

                    EMMA

          Cheese and cucumber

                      INNES

          Thank-you

Somewhere in the woods, Annie has found a treasure trove of

worms and slugs.

                    ANNIE (O.S. DISTANT)

          Over here ....there are millions!

                    DARWIN

          It doesn't strike you as an

          exceedingly wasteful plan - these

          myriad lives created only to be

          immediately extinguished.

                    EMMA

              (a gentle warning)

          Charles....

                    INNES

              (confidently)

          They are providing food for

          others.

                    DARWIN

          You think they are happy about

          it?

                      INNES

          Happy?

Close up on a writing worm. Hooker is instructing George

how to put a worm on a hook.

                    HOOKER

          Through his bottom and up though

          his mouth - perfect

                                                      16

                    DARWIN

          ....To be doing Gods will.

                    EMMA

              (to Innes)

          Please ignore him. After two

          glasses of claret he tends to

          becomes mischievous.

                    DARWIN

          No I'm serious. If thousands are

          destroyed that a few may live

          their lives, is not the general

          sum total of happiness not in

          some kind of massive deficit?

                    INNES

          Well far be it from me to

          speculate on the mind of God, far

          less the happiness of an

          earthworm ha ha ha. But it seems

          to me that nature is at

          peace...and most of her denizens

          are content.

                    EMMA

          Amen.

                    INNES

              (to Darwin)

          You don't agree.

                    DARWIN

          I think it is a battlefield. A

          constant and shifting struggle

          for survival between everything

          and everything else.

                     EMMA

          I really do think men have a

          problem with natural beauty. They

          cannot ever just accept it for

          what it is.

              (Calls off)

          Children! Sandwiches!

              (Then)

          Tell me of your wife Mr Innes.

Darwin lies back on the rug and turns his head away from

the sun.

The base of a tangled hedgerow is just a few feet away.

Looking into its tangled depths he sees something gleaming

white - the skull of a sheep with briars growing through

the eye sockets.

                                                              17

24   EXT. BASE OF THE HEDGEROW. TIME-LAPSE. NIGHT                  24

     The sheep's skull is half-decomposed.

     In fast forward we see maggots pecking the remnants of

     flesh from the bone, birds feeding on the maggots.

     A bird becomes trapped among the briars. It flaps madly

     upsetting a nest.

     Eggs and blind featherless hatchlings fall down through the

     dark web of branches where they are devoured by voles and

     rats, then slugs, then worms

     All the times tendrils and vines are growing, the skull -

     bleached white - now encased in a cage of thick spiny

     branches, fizzing with insect life, where ants and ground

     beetles feast on the carcasses of slugs and....

25   INT. DARWIN'S BEDROOM. THE PRESENT. DAWN                      25

     Darwin wakes in sudden terror.

     Dawn light illuminates the wallpaper in front of him - a

     William Morris design of interweaving vines.

     Emma, is asleep in her night-cap at his side.

     Darwin lies for a while in the semi darkness, until his

     hand, fluttering on the coverlet, becomes still at last.

26   INT. SCULLERY. THE PAST. DAY.                                 26

     Light and noise.

     Crash of gleaming copperware, clattering of water in the

     pipes as the servants prepare Sunday breakfast

     The cook, Mrs Davies looks out through a steamed up window

     to see the angular figure of Charles Darwin, bent almost

     double inspecting a tiny segment of lawn.

     Brodie joins Mrs Davies at the window.

                         MRS DAVIES

               What is he doing now, exactly?

                         BRODIE

               Cutting the grass with nail

               scissors.

                         MRS DAVIES

               Such a shame he never had a

               proper job. At least your Mr

               Thackeray had his books to write.

                                                              18

     Children thunder up and down the stairs between Brodie who

     is doing a final check on grooming and Emma who is

     marshalling them in the hall.

     Baby Lenny starts crying and she goes to comfort him

29   INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM. THE PAST. DAY.                           29

     Brodie is arranging hair and tying ribbons for Annie (9)

     Etty (6) and Betty (3)

                         ANNIE

               Did you never think of getting

               married Miss Brodie.

                         BRODIE

               Once. But he went to Australia

               and I missed my chance.

     Willy passes the door, his hair in need of brushing.

                         BRODIE

               Master William. Hairbrush.

     William comes in. Brodie brushes the back of his hair.

                          WILLY

               Ow. Ow!

                         BRODIE

               Well what do you expect. It is a

               birds nest.

                         WILLY

               Papa says God doesn't care if we

               Your father is a very wize man

               but has a small understanding of

     Willy presents them for checking.

               You can go.

30   INT. HALLWAY. THE PAST. DAY.                                  30

     The children come racing and swinging and clattering down

     the stairs.

     Emma, holding the baby in one arm, steers a tricycle out of

     the way, clearing a path to the door

                         EMMA

               Mrs Davies, Will you ask Jenny to

               wear a bonnet. I would not like

               people to think her fast.

     George aged 5 tugs at her skirt

                         WILLY

               Can I bring my mouse for a

               blessing?

                         EMMA

               What mouse?

     George (5) pulls it out from his pocket. Its dead, muddy

     and bloody

                         GEORGE

               Elsie caught it in the barn. We

               need to pray for his soul

                         EMMA

               Mice don't have souls. Leave it

               on the window sill. Everyone come

               now or we shall be late.

     Pealing of church bells

     Mist rises from the ploughed fields and hangs among the

     ancient oaks.

     A little procession heads down the lane. The Darwins -

     Charles and Emma - plus their servants and children (older

     now, for we have flipped into the present), all in their

     Sunday best.

     The trees are bare. Their breath condenses as they walk.

32   EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE. THE PRESENT. DAY                         32

     The ancient flint church stands in the centre of Downe

     (sic) village, opposite the George and Dragon pub.

                                                             20

     A massive and venerable Yew tree casts its shade over a

     number of gravestones one of them inscribed "to Mary Darwin

     born Sept 1842 died Oct 1842."

     Beyond the church fence, villagers greet each other before

     heading inside. The great majority of the village have

     turned out, from Squire Lubbock through the tradesmen and

     domestic servants from the village to the clodhoppers (farm

     labourers) in their colored smocks.

     Rev Innes is welcoming his large flock at the gate.

                         EMMA

               Reverend Innes.

                         INNES

                   (smiling)

               Ma'am. Welcome. Welcome

     Then his eye moves on to Charles Darwin and his smile

     falters, his expression turning slightly cold.

     Darwin tips his hat rather stiffly and walks away, through

     the throng of parishioners, leaving his family to file into

     the church without him.

33   EXT. WOODLAND. PRESENT. DAY                                  33

     Darwin walks across the meadow and into the woods.

     A flock of crows take flight from the rookery in the bare

     trees overhead.

34   INT. DOVECOTE. PRESENT. DAY                                  34

     In darkness, a furious struggle, squawking and frantically

     beating wings.

     Darwin seizes on a dove and backs out of the dovecote, the

     silhouette of his upper torso taking shape in the square

     hole in the floor.

     He climbs down the ladder, passes the captive bird down to

     Parslow, then climbs back up and pushes him upper body into

     the dovecot again, in search of the next victim.

35   EXT. THE GARDEN. DOWN HOUSE. THE PRESENT. DAY                35

     The dovecote is a substantial affair on four pillars with a

     ladder in the centre.

     Outside the dovecote, the boys are racing around playing at

     soldiers. (Franky 10, Lenny 8, Horace 6)

                                                              21

     Parslow has a number of the birds in cages

                         DARWIN

               Ring the two milky pouters. We'll

               sacrifice the tumblers and

               skeletonize them. Then...

     He looks up as a coach appears in the lane. The boys

     immediately break off from their game and run after it,

     shouting.

                         BOYS

               It's Mr Hooker. It's Mr Hooker!

     Darwin tries to wipe the bird shit off his hands and

     succeeds only in getting it on his sleeve.

     His breathing quickens. He seems at a loss. Parslow is

     awaiting further instructions

                         PARSOLOW

               Then... what Sir?

                         DARWIN

               Just. ...to the shed with them. I

               shall clean myself up.

     He hurries off.

36   EXT. THE FRONT GATE. THE PRESENT. DAY.                        36

     The coach pulls up and Hooker alights - ten years older

     than when we saw him catching fish, but still with the same

     hallmark side whiskers and wire-rimmed spectacles, the same

     springy step and ready grin.

     Already he is being mobbed by the younger boys - Lenny,

     Franky, and Horace - who clearly adore him.

                         BOYS(AD LIB)

               - We're the Light Brigade Horace

               is a Russian.

                         HOOKER

               Good choice Horace. I shall be

               Lord Raglan and watch the

               slaughter from a safe distance.

                         BOYS

               - Will you give us a piggy-back?

               - Lenny cut his foot on a nail.

               There was lots of blood!

     Emma emerges from the front door. She smiles, pleased to

     see Hooker despite her misgivings.

                                                         22

Then her smile falters as another man emerges from the

coach behind him.

                    HOOKER

          Emma. Forgive the short notice.

          You know Thomas Huxley.

                    EMMA

          Only by reputation

                    HUXLEY

          Mrs Darwin.

                    HOOKER

          He insisted on coming and I could

          not refuse him.

                    EMMA

          Tell papa his visitors are here.

                    LENNY

          He knows already.

                    HORACE

          He went that way.

Emma smiles brightly, covering for her embarrassment at her

husband's increasingly erratic behavior.

                    EMMA

          Anyway. Come in please. Come in.

Hooker heads towards the house, the boy still clustered

around him.

                    FRANKY

          Sir, Is it true when you were in

          the Himalayas you were imprisoned

          by the king of Sikkim?

                    HOOKER

          Absolutely true.

                    LENNY

          And he thought you were a spy for

          stealing his rhododendrons?

                    HOOKER

          That's approximately true.

                    FRANKY

          ....and he wouldn't let you leave

          unless you agreed to marry his

          fattest daughter.

                                                             23

                         HOOKER

               Yes. (Conspiratorial) ....but

               you are never to tell my wife

               that!

                         EMMA

               Children leave Mr Hooker alone

               now. I'm sure he has more

               important things to discuss.

                         HOOKER

               Not really, but I think Mr Huxley

               does....

     Huxley has seen Darwin, washing his hands by the

     "skeletonizing shed".

     Huxley hangs back to introduce himself as Hooker steers

     Emma off into the house.

                         HOOKER

               I have my heart set on a cup of

               tea and one of Mrs Davies'

               scones.

     Emma looks anxiously after Huxley but allows herself to be

     gently side-lined.

37   INT. KITCHEN. THE PRESENT. DAY .                             37

     Emma is by the kitchen window, rearranging tea things on a

     tray.

     The sky outside is dark and lowering.

     Through the window she can see Darwin heading off down the

     sand walk - head bowed, walking stick in hand - deep in

     conversation with Huxley.

     She drops a tea-cup which smashes on the stone floor.

                         MRS DAVIES

               I'll do that ma'am. Please. Let

               me do it.

38   EXT. DOWN HOUSE. THE SAND WALK. THE PRESENT. DAY.            38

     The Sand-walk is a gravel walking path between the garden

     and the fields, flanked by mature oaks and ancient willows.

                         HUXLEY

               We're reforming the Linnean. The

               committee will comprise myself,

               Lyell, Huxley...yourself of

               course if you are willing.

                                                      24

Darwin grunts noncommittally. The Crunch crunch of their

feet is punctuated by the regular stomp of his metal-shod

walking stick.

                    HUXLEY

          We intend to reclaim science as a

          profession - wrest it away from

          the country parsons and beetle-

          collectors. Your book will be our

          rallying point.

                    DARWIN.

          You know it is not yet any fit

          state to publish.

                    HUXLEY

          I have read your detailed

          abstract. The argument is

          complete and utterly compelling.

          All that is lacking is the detail

          and we know you have that in

          abundance. Your barnacle work has

          established you as the pre-

          eminent authority on marine life.

                    DARWIN.

          On one small mollusc!

                     HOOKER

          In which the whole story of

          creation can be read. Do not

          pretend to me that was not your

          intention.

                    DARWIN.

          Honestly....

                    HUXLEY

          A "family tree" of barnacles

          stretching back 300 million years

          to the time it was a free

          swimming prawn!.

                    DARWIN.

          There are many gaps.

                    HOOKER

          Of course with gaps! But that is

          the very point. If we but had the

          complete fossil record we could

          trace all life back to one speck

          of protoplasm. The branching of

          forms in ever more complex

          succession...until.

                    DARWIN.

          Yes yes, but one cannot infer too

          much.

                                                      25

                    HOOKER

          Mr Darwin. Either you are being

          disingenuous or you do not fully

          understand you own

          accomplishment. You have killed

          God.

                      DARWIN.

          Mr Huxley

                    HUXLEY

          ....and good riddance to the

          bearded malicious old bugger!

                    DARWIN

              (interrupts)

          Please I must beg of you....

                    HUXLEY

          No. I must beg of you sir. Joseph

          Hooker we know is too nice a chap

          to do it. You are a fine and

          brilliant man who hates to give

          offence - an admirable quality -

          wish I had it myself. But what do

          we believe? What do we know to be

          true. Will you light the way or

          leave us all to flounder in the

          mire for another decade.

He stops and lowers himself onto a bench, teeth clenched.

                    HOOKER

          Are you alright?

                    DARWIN.

          A touch of indigestion. It will

          pass.

Its clearly worse than that, but Huxley, refusing to be

distracted, blithely ignores it and sits down beside him

til the worst of it passes.

                    HUXLEY

          It is time to write your book Mr

          Darwin. Write it brilliantly as

          we all know you can. Strike hard

          and fast with a blow that is

          utterly conclusive.

                    DARWIN

              (in pain)

          Sir, you are talking like a

          revolutionary and really...

                    HUXLEY

          It is a revolution. And not

          before time.

                    (MORE)

                                                           26

                         HUXLEY (cont'd)

               Goodbye to the lot of em - damned

               bishops and Archbishops with

               their threats of eternal

               punishment.

                         DARWIN

               And you'd replace Gods Laws with

               what.

                         HUXLEY

               The laws of logic. The laws of

               nature.

                         DARWIN

               Knowing, as we do, that most

               capital crimes are her everyday

               practises: Theft, rape, murder,

               adultery, infanticide....

     Huxley waves it away

                         DARWIN

               We live in a society bound

               together by the church. An

               improbable sort of barque I grant

               you but at least it floats. You

               suggest we change all that at a

               stroke. You wish me to rebuild,

               plank by plank, the very vessel

               we are sailing in.

39   EXT. DOWN HOUSE. DAY.                                        39

     The Coach to London has pulled up outside the front gate.

     Huxley is aboard. Darwin is talking with the coachman

     Hooker comes down the path in his black coat, carrying his

     Gladstone bag.

                            EMMA

               Mr Hooker.

     He turns. He has already said his good-byes.

                         EMMA

               I beg you, please don't push him.

                         HOOKER

               No-one can push Charles. You know

               how fixed he is. Bit of a

               barnacle himself ... his own

               words.

                         EMMA

               And if you prize him from his

               rock he will die. I know you all

               mean well but....

                                                              27

                         COACHMAN

                   (Impatiently)

               All aboard!

     Hooker gets aboard. Huxley leans out of a window and waves

     cheerily to the whey-faced Darwin

                         HUXLEY

               We'll meet again, Mr Darwin

40   INT. THE LANEWAY. DAY                                         40

     The coach pulls away.

     Looking back though the rear window Hooker sees Emma with

     the boys clustered around her skirts.

                         HUXLEY

               What did she say to you?

                         HOOKER

               That it was killing him.

                         HUXLEY

               A mighty slow death considering

               the time he's spent. We'll be

               dead and buried ourselves if he

               prevaricates much longer.

     Huxley takes off his spectacles and polishes them,

     embarrassed by Huxley's directness, inspecting his own

     conscience in the bevelled glass.

41   INT. DARWIN'S STUDY. NIGHT                                    41

     In the darkened study, with his specimens and books all

     around him, Darwin kneels by the box.

     Steeling himself, he unlocks the padlock and opens the lid

     and takes out the papers and notebooks which are stored

     there.

     The bulk of it is a single manuscript, accumulated over

     many years, divided into 14 chapters with pages of notes

     interleaved.

     The Chapters are headed. Variation under domestication,

     variation under nature, Struggle for Existence, Natural

     Selection....

     A noise behind him almost makes him jump out of his skin.

     Its Annie, ten years old in her checked dress, as she will

     always be in his imagination.

                                                              28

                         ANNIE

               Why are you scared?

                         DARWIN

               Like you said. You're in it.

                         ANNIE

               Its only a book, silly.

     He sits there regarding the open box, paralysed by

     indecision. Annie tenderly smooths his hair, rearranging

     his collar.

                         DARWIN

               What are you doing, Annie?

                         ANNIE

               I'm making you beautiful.

                         DARWIN

               I have to work.

     Though the soft touch of her little hands is almost too

     real for him to bear and he closes his eyes

                         ANNIE

               Breath in, papa. Breathe out. Now

               Tell me a story.

                         DARWIN

               I have no time....

                         ANNIE

               About Jenny. Please?

     The sound of a wave breaking. Wind stirs Darwin's hair

     He opens his eyes and he is ....

42   EXT. ENGLISH BEACHSIDE. THE PAST DAY                          42

     Sitting with Annie ten years ago on an English pebble

     beach.

     She has collected a pile of shells and is arranging them in

     "families".

     The dialogue is continuous

                         DARWIN

               Why do you always ask for Jenny?

               Its so sad.

                         ANNIE

               That's why I like it. It makes me

               cry.

                                                           29

     She looks up from her shells and smiles winningly.

     Darwin looks out to sea, at the bright crashing line of

     surf, and begins the familiar, much-told tale:

                         DARWIN

               Once apon a time there was a

               family of Orang-u-tangs living in

               the jungles of darkest Borneo

43   EXT. JUNGLES OF BORNEO. DAY                                  43

     Our POV moves between dark tropical trees to find a group

     of Orangutans flopping around grooming each other.

     As with the land of the Fuegan savages, there is something

     slightly artificial about these jungles, as though the

     trees really belong in Kew gardens, and the naked jungle

     warriors, whom we now see stalking through them, are on

     loan from the museum of mankind.

                         DARWIN

               Their eldest daughter was the

               most loving, caring and trusting

               Orang of all.

     We follow a young nimble female, swinging through the

     trees, revelling in her own gymnastic ability, until she

     stops - hearing something: the sound of human speech.

                         DARWIN

               But these qualities in themselves

               cannot guarantee an ape's

               survival. Sometimes, quite the

               reverse.

     Native hunters are creeping through the undergrowth

     A warning screech from one of the Orang-u-tangs posted as

     lookouts.

     Most of the apes flee up into the canopy. Jenny stays where

     she is, fascinated, just a moment longer than is prudent.

                         DARWIN

               When she realized her danger it

               was too late.

     As she turns to flee a weighted net is thrown on top of

     her. The hunters pounce.

                         DARWIN

               They put her in a bag and carried

               her off....

                                                              30

                         ANNIE

               " much to her loving parent's

               sorrow."

                            DARWIN

               Exactly.

     The family screech and hoot, anguished, as the hunters head

     back off through the trees.

44   EXT. MARKET-PLACE. DAY                                        44

     Exotic coins and bank-notes pass from hand to hand: from

     the tribal chief to the sultan, in his overlarge turban,

     from the sultan to the trader in his solar topee and

     stained white suit.

                         DARWIN

               The hunters sold her the to the

               Sultan who promptly sold her to a

               visiting Englishman who packed

               her aboard a sailing ship and

               brought her to London zoo.

     Jenny is taken out of a bamboo cage and put into a metal

     cage.

45   INT. CARGO SHIP. DAY                                          45

     The cage is lowered by a crane. Jenny looks out from her

     swaying prison at spinning grey skies and brick warehouses.

46   INT. CAGE. LONDON ZOO. DAY                                    46

     Now she sits disconsolately in a corner of her permanent

     enclosure.

     She has been dressed, ridiculously and poignantly in a

     smock and a bonnet.

     A group of onlookers are trying to get a reaction out of

     her. Eventually they give up and move on.

                         DARWIN

               In London she had many admirers -

               of whom your father was but one.

     Darwin moves forwards from the shadows, where he has been

     observing and taking notes.

     As the other humans move away be attempts to start a

     conversation with Jenny in her own language, much in the

     way he communicated with baby Annie.

                                                        31

                    DARWIN

          Hoo hoo hoo hoo.

Jenny regards him sceptically then looks away.

                    DARWIN.

          HOO!!

She startles and looks at him aggressively.

                    DARWIN

          Hm?

He reaches in his pocket. This gets her interest. She comes

closer, expecting food.

Darwin takers out a sprig of verbena - a strongly scented

herb.

He holds in front of his nose and inhales, making contented

expressions of pleasure.

Jenny watches.

Darwin holds the verbena towards Jenny.

Cautiously she extends a hand through the bars.

Their fingers touch in space, like God Giving life to Adam.

For Darwin its a breakthrough - a moment of connection.

Jenny eats the verbena and spits it out, shrieking angrily.

                    CHARLES

          Wait, sorry, wait - I've got

          something else here for you

He reaches in his pocket. She cocks her head, alert.

With the air of a conjurer, he pulls out:

A child's hand mirror, flashing as it catches the sun

through the skylights.

                    CHARLES

              (pleasurable surprise)

          Ahhhh!!

He shows Jenny her own reflection and, then hands the

mirror through the bars.

Jenny takes the mirror, bites it, discovers it is inedible,

and smashes it on the ground.

Charles makes a sad, whining sound

                    CHARLES

          Hew Hew Hew...

                                                              32

                         JENNY

                   (pouting)

               Hmph.

     Meaning: "OK then, I'm sorry."

     It's such a complex human reaction - grudging contrition -

     that Charles laughs aloud with pleasure.

     Jenny laughs.

     Charles takes out a mouth organ and plays a snatch of

     Chopin.

     Jenny covers her ears and chatters. "Not listening not

     listening!"

     Charles, insulted, stops playing.

     Jenny laughs waves a hand as if to say: "Play, if it amuses

     you. I'm must kidding."

47   EXT. THE BEACH. THE PAST. DAY                                 47

     The salt wind. The dazzling light. The slow pulse of the

     surf.

     Darwin has paused in his narrative.

                         ANNIE

               Go on papa.

                         DARWIN

               Go on what.

                         ANNIE

               The bit where she gets sick and

               dies.

                         DARWIN

               No. Why do you want to hear that

               bit?

                         ANNIE

               I just like it. It makes me cry.

     Darwin smiles, his own eyes filling with tears.

     Then a door opens, softly, in the sky.

48   INT. THE STUDY. THE PRESENT. NIGHT                            48

     It opens wider to reveal Emma's elegant profile, framed

     against the gaslight of the hallway.

                                                      33

Her POV: the black box is unlocked and open, its contents

strewn around the floor at darwins feet.

Darwin is sitting on the floor of the study holding in his

had a magazine, published by the Society for the useful

Distribution of Knowledge, with a picture of Jenny on the

cover

                    EMMA

          Are you coming to bed?

                       DARWIN

          Presently.

He doesn't move. She comes in

                    EMMA

          What did Huxley want?

                    DARWIN

          He thinks I should write it and

          be done with it. He feels it is a

          question of moral courage ...or

          the lack of it.

                    EMMA

          You did not tell him about your

          health.

                    DARWIN

          His theory is that I am making

          myself ill by holding back. That

          I should lance the boil. Plunge

          in and hang the consequences.

                    EMMA

          Thank the Lord he is not a

          surgeon.

Darwin takes a breath and plunges in himself:

                    DARWIN

          I've concluded he is right. Bite

          the gag. Speed is everything. It

          will all be over in a matter of

          months.

Emma is horrified.

                    EMMA

          It is not mere months that

          concern me Charles. Nor even

          years or decades...

Its said quietly but with genuine anguish. To Emma it is

as though her life partner has announced he's contemplating

suicide.

                                                           34

                         EMMA

               Do you really care   so little for

               your immortal soul   - for the

               knowledge that you   and I may

               never be together,   in all of

               eternity.

                         DARWIN

                   (softly)

               You know that what concerns you

               concerns me also. What do think

               has held me in limbo all these

               years.

     Emma has. They both know it. She turns abruptly from the

     door and hurries away.

49   INT. BEDROOM. THE PRESENT. NIGHT.                            49

     Emma has been crying. She lies in bed pretending to sleep.

     Darwin gets into bed behind her. He wants desperately to

     reach out a hand to touch her, to comfort her, but he

     cannot do it for fear of weakening his own fragile resolve.

                         DARWIN

               Dearest Emma. You know This is

               not a decision made lightly....

50   INT. DARWINS STUDY. THE PRESENT. DAWN                        50

     In the dawn light, Darwin is writing a letter to his wife.

                         DARWIN (V.O.)

               .... It has been a very slow and

               gradual process, like the raising

               of continents.

51   EXT. GARDEN. THE PRESENT. DAY.                               51

     EMMA stands alone in the wintry garden, a white apron over

     her black dress, reading.

                         DARWIN (V.O)

               What else can I say to you,

               except that it seems the process

               is now complete.

     A tear tracks down the curve of Emma's cheek as she folds

     the letter, puts it in her pocket and return to the

     business of dead-heading flowers.

     In voice over we hear singing.

                                                             35

               Each little flower that opens,

               Each little bird that sings,

               He made their glowing colors,

               He made their tiny wings.

53   INT. DOWNE VILLAGE CHURCH. THE PAST. DAY.                     53

     The church is packed for the Sunday Morning service

     The Darwin family stand in the front row.

     Emma, the servants and the rest of the family are singing

     lustily: Parslow - a somewhat pompous operatic tenor,

     Brodie and Innes both loudly Scottish (Innes out of tune),

     Annie by Darwins side, trilling along in a tuneful little

     descant.

     She notices her father is not singing and offers him her

     hymn book with the words.

     Darwin smiles and returns it. Its not that he doesn't know

     the lyrics, its just that he can't bring himself to say

     them.

                         DARWIN FAMILY

               All things bright and beautiful

               all creatures great and small.

               All things wize and wonderful the

               Lord God made them all.

     The organ, played by Mrs Innes,   wheezes to a pause. Innes

     himself mounts the pulpit.

                         INNES

               Let us pray.

     Everyone bows their heads in prayer.

                         INNES (CONT'D)

               Lord God we know the world is

               governed by Thy plan.

     Darwin is immediately not listening.

                                                              36

     He looks along the row of his children, standing dutifully

     in a line between Charles and Emma.

     George, aged 5, is studying the woodlice which are nesting

     between the pages of his hymnal

                         INNES (O.S)

               Extending even to the merest

               creatures thou hast made, such

               that even a sparrow falls not to

               the ground without thy will.

     Darwin, stands watching the play of light from the stained

     glass window on his shoes. Then raises his head

                         INNES

               Teach us that all misfortune.

               All sickness and death, all the

               trials and miseries of which we

               daily complain are intended for

               our good, being not the vagaries

               of an uncaring universe but the

               corrections of a wize and

               affectionate parent

     Innes looks up sternly and sees the Darwin's head raised

     among the sea of down-turned heads.

     Their eyes meet briefly in a sort of challenge, and in that

     moment, Darwin somehow knows with absolutely certainty that

     religious faith has left him.

     With a whispered word to the beadle standing next to him to

     take the collection Darwin slips out from the pew and heads

     off up the aisle.

                           DARWIN

               Excuse me

     He's intending to be quiet and subtle but the creaking

     boards under his feet loudly announce his departure.

     Innes raises his voice above the fusillade.

                         INNES

               Turn with me now to the book of

               Job, Chapter Two verse twelve

     The congregation, not daring to raise their heads, watch

     Darwin's sturdy walking shoes departing down the aisle.

54   EXT. THE CHURCH. THE PAST. DAY.                               54

     The rise and fall of Innes's voice continues in the

     background as Darwin walks out from the porch, emerging

     from shadow into sunlight.

                                                              37

     A summers day. He feels like a weight has been lifted.

     The church beadle comes out behind him.

                         BEADLE

               Are you all right, sir?

                         DARWIN

               Never better. Thank-you.

     He heads off up the gravel path

55   INT WOODLANDS. THE PRESENT. DAY                               55

     The faint and Distant sound of church singing filters

     through the misty woods. The black wet trunks of trees

     catch the sunlight.

     Frosty dew highlights Mistletoe and holly and dead bracken

     and the sudden red flash of a robin.

     Darwin cuts a strange dark angular figure, walking along

     the narrow track a single step at a time.

     He pauses breathing, and listens.

     His quick eye catches the robin seizing a worm.

     Further on. A pheasant breaks cover. A hare stands upright

     in a clearing then bounds away.

     Darwin looks down and takes another step, placing his feet

     carefully, silently so as not to disturb the wildlife.

     Cut to a different pair of much newer shoes in exactly the

     same spot.

56   INT. WOODLANDS. THE PAST. DAY                                 56

     Darwin is ten years younger, pacing in the same, measured

     way through summer woodland.

     There's a noise behind him and he turns, finger to his lips

     for silence.

     Annie turns away from him and passes the sign down the line

     of children: Etty, George, Betty and Franky, in decreasing

     order of height.

                         ANNIE

               Shh

                         FRANKY

                   (to ANNIE)

               What are we looking at?

                                                      38

The question comes back up the line

                      DARWIN

          A weasel.

The children bunch up to gaze on a strange and wonderful

sight.

In a little sun-dappled clearing a weasel is turning loop

the loops in a strange spiralling dance for the benefit

of...

...a young rabbit, which sits utterly hypnotized by the

performance.

At first its strange and amusing, then the dance becomes

more sinister. The weasel advancing by tiny increments as

it tumbles in the air, finally

                      ANNIE

          NO!

The weasel seizes the bunny rabbit by the back of the neck

and shakes it savagely.

The rabbit shrieks and spasms.

Annie is beside herself, drumming the ground with her feet

in a fever of fear and pity.

The rabbit is still in its dearth throes, its neck broken,

its back legs still jerking

                    ANNIE

          No! No! Stop it. Daddy. Stop it.

          Make it stop.

The rabbit is already dead.

                    DARWIN

          Annie, Annie, Annie.

He sinks to his knees, heedless of the mud on his Sunday

best worsted, embracing her.

The others are shocked and amazed by the rabbits death, but

none of them distressed as Annie. They are country children

and death is an everyday event

          The chickens do that too when

          cookie kills them

                    ANNIE

              (tearful furious)

          Chickens are different!

              (To her father)

                    (MORE)

                                                           39

                         ANNIE (cont'd)

               Why didn't you do something. You

               should have stopped it!

                         DARWIN

               The weasel has to eat. Its the

               way of the world. Annie

                         ANNIE

               Its not fair. Its not fair.

                         DARWIN

               No, its not fair at all.

     Patting her and stroking her as the little sobs subside.

     The weasel is dragging the dead rabbit back to its lair.

                         DARWIN

               ....but still it is

               extraordinary, do you not think,

               that a weasel should learn to

               dance the polka.

     Despite herself the concept amuses Annie. Chest still

     heaving with sobs - she dries her eyes and smiles at him

     through her tears.

57   INT. DOWN HOUSE. BEDROOMS. THE PAST .NIGHT .                 57

     Piano music - Chopin - plays softly over as Charles and

     Emma do the rounds of their large brood of children,

     turning out lamps and kissing sleeping heads, taking a doll

     from one sleeping child's embrace, a sword from another.

     Shooing a cat and her kittens from the bedroom.

                         EMMA

               Good-night Lenny.

                          DARWIN

               Good-night Frankie

                         EMMA

               Good-night Betty.

     Darwin watches his wife, a sensuous figure, stooped over

     the sleeping child, a lock of hair falling forwards as she

     kisses her.

                         DARWIN

               Good-night George

                         EMMA

               Good-night Etty.

                         DARWIN

               Good-night Willy

                                                              40

                         DARWIN AND EMMA

               Good-night Annie

     She's sound asleep. Finally Charles and Emma are alone

     together in the blissfully silent house.

     Emma smiles

                         EMMA

               Dear Charles

                         DARWIN

               Dearest Emma

     He takes her hand and leads her to their bedroom.

58   EXT. THE BEACH. THE PAST. DAY                                 58

     Emma lies on a rug, her head is in Darwin's lap. She is

     reading aloud from a new book of poems by Wordsworth.

                         EMMA

               "Loving she is, and tractable

               though wild.

               And innocence hath privilege in

               her.

               To dignify arch looks and

               laughing eyes;

               And feats of cunning; and the

               pretty round

               Of trespasses, affected to

               provoke Mock chastisement, and

               partnership in play"

     She puts the book down

                         DARWIN

                   (smiling)

               Then we were wrong. She is not

               unique after all.

     Darwin is watching Annie dancing in front of the surf ,

     turning cartwheels - a wild dancing sprite of the sea,

     oblivious to the cold, shouting and singing:

59   THE BEACH. LATER                                              59

     Later, Near the cliff, Darwin is "geologising"

     He's excited, breathless and windswept, shouting over the

     sound of the nearby surf as he clambers over the huge

     assorted boulders pointing out the geological strata to his

     kids who are more interested in clambering.

                                                      41

                    DARWIN

          This is Devonian, about 400

          million years ago. Rocks like

          this might have fishes in them,

          trilobites, tree ferns, corals

          maybe....

He knock off a corner of rock with his geological hammer,

then moves on

                    ETTY

          Is this a bit?

                    DARWIN

          No that is Cretaceous Etty. It

          was made a hundred millions years

          ago, when this cliff was a coral

          reef and Down village was a swamp

          full of great crocodiles.

Tap tap tap with his hammer as the boys scramble upwards,

playing at mountaineers.

                    DARWIN

          We might find oysters and sponges

          imprinted in it, or dinosaurs if

          we were lucky...

                    GEORGE

          What's a dinosaur?

                    ETTY

          Professor Owen invented them.

                    DARWIN

          They are the giant lizards which

          lived on earth before there were

          any humans.

                    BETTY

          But they weren't real

                    DARWIN

          Of course they are, Betty. Did I

          never tell you of the skeletons I

          found in South America

              (to Etty)

          Do you remember Mr Martell?

                    ETTY

          No.

Annie arrives, hopping nimbly over the rocks still in her

wet swimsuit

                                                           42

                         ANNIE

               Yes you do. When he came to tea

               and showed us drawings of his

               Iguanodon. And George burnt his

               fingers roasting chestnuts.

                          ETTY

               Oh yes.

                         ANNIE

               She doesn't remember.

                         DARWIN

               You should have your clothes on

               Annie. You are quite blue.

                         ANNIE

               Savages don't swear clothes.

     She runs to the top of a great fallen rock, spreads her

     arms out, and yells to the sky.

                         ANNIE

               I'm a Fuegan.

                         DARWIN

               Well don't fall and hurt

               yourself. Your mother would never

               forgive me.

     Annie gives a shout and disappears head over heels.

                          DARWIN

               Annie!

                         ANNIE

               I've found one!

     In the rubble at the base of the rocks she has landed,

     unhurt and quite by accident on a perfect specimen of a

     fossilized trilobite.

60   INT. DARWIN'S STUDY. THE PRESENT. DAY                        60

     The black box lies open with all its secrets strewn around

     the office.

     Stacks of paper - a stack for every chapter - are held down

     with paperweights - a fossil, a skull, a specimen bottle.

     Darwin squares a stack of blank paper between his hands,

     then reaches for his pen.

61   INT. VILLAGE SCHOOL. THE PAST . DAY.                         61

     Annie reaches for her pen.

                                                           43

     Reverend Innes is giving the children their writing

     lessons, according to "Mulhauser's technique"

                         INNES

               First positions.

     The children assume the position as if in some militaristic

     drill.

                         INNES

               Second positions.

     Grips are adjusted, pens are dipped.

                         INNES

               Assume the distance.

     The children lean back fractionally, so their elbows are

     just back from the edge of the desk.

                         INNES

               .....and begin.

     The Children start to copy the sentence which Innes has

     written on the blackboard.

     Annie reads the sentence and hesitates: "And on the seventh

     day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested"

62   INT DARWIN'S STUDY. DAY.                                    62

     Darwin massages his cramped hand then takes a blank sheet

     of notepaper.

                         DARWIN

               Dearest Hooker. I am one week

               into the great project and I feel

               at last that it is real. Its

               title is "On the Origin of

               Species." As I write theses words

               why does it feel as though I am

               confessing to a murder...

     A paper stirs in the breeze and he pins it with the nearest

     object to hand - Annie's trilobite.

     His eye rests on it a moment

     CUT TO

63   INT. DARWIN'S STUDY. THE PAST . DAY                         63

     The corrugated gray surface, greatly magnified.

     The Darwin of ten years ago is examining the trilobite with

     a watchmakers eyeglass.

                                                             44

     There is a small mirror above his desk, angled so as to

     give him a view of the path leading round from the front of

     the house.

     Innes appears briefly in it, preceded by Annie, who is

     trotting to keep pace with him and crying.

     Darwin, intent on his work, notices neither of them

     From downstairs he hears the door knocker then Brodie's

     voice, then Emma's overlapping with half-heard fragments of

     Innes's Scottish brogue.

                           INNES (O.S.)

                 I thought you needed to know why

                 I had to chastised her.

     Darwin remains immersed, examining each detail of the

     trilobite, comparing it with other specimens in books and

     in boxes.

                           INNES (O.S.)

                 ....It is not fair to the other

                 nor to Annie herself that her

                 head be filled with these ideas....

                           EMMA

                 Are you listening, Annie?

     Annie sobs louder, incoherent in her grief.

     Darwin finally focusses on the sounds, recognizes her

     distress and gets up to investigate.

64   EXT .UPPER HALLWAY. DAY.                                     64

     He reaches the top of the stairs. Annie is directly below

     him, slumped, still sobbing at the foot of the stairs.

     Emma has ushered Innes to the porch out of sight.

                           INNES (O.S)

                  I shall bid you good day then

     The front   door closes. Darwin comes downstairs

                           DARWIN

                 What happened?

                            ANNIE

                 Nothing.

                           DARWIN

                 Its not nothing. (To Annie) Why

                 are your knees bleeding?

                                                      45

                    EMMA

          Mr Innes had to have words with

          her. It is sorted now.

                    DARWIN

          Words are very well. I am asking

          what happened to her knees.

                    ANNIE

          Mr Innes sent me to the corner

          and made me kneel on rock-salt.

                    DARWIN

          What!

                    ANNIE

              (in a rush)

          I said there were dinosaurs and

          he said there wasn't dinosaurs

          but there were because you saw

          them.

                    EMMA

              (interrupting)

          Annie. Let me talk to your

          father. He told her to kneel til

          she repented...

                    DARWIN

          Repented what?

                    EMMA

          The bleeding is due to her own

          stubborn-ness. It is finished

          now.

                    DARWIN

          It is by no means finished. Where

          is my coat. Its intolerable

                    EMMA

          Charles. Please.

Charles ignores her, Forcing his arm into the sleeve of his

coat.

                    EMMA

          Mr Innes is a dear friend and

          neighbor. I beg you at least

          appraise yourself the facts. She

          contradicted him repeatedly. The

          fault was Annie's Mr Innes was

          quite within his rights.

                                                      46

                    DARWIN

              (his arm is stuck)

          In his rights to torture our

          children for expressing the plain

          truth.

Brodie appears and Darwin ushers Annie towards her

            DARWIN                           EMMA

...Please take her to           It is not the truth as he

kitchen.                        sees it

                    DARWIN

          Well damn how he sees it. Damn

          the pair of them and all their

          works

                    EMMA

          Charles listen to yourself.

          Listen

Blocking his path as he heads for the door. Her palm flat

on his lapel, soothing, reasoning with him

                    DARWIN

          Emma please. I will not have

          Innes tell me what I can and

          cannot tell my children.

                    EMMA

          It is what I have told them every

          night at bedtime. It is the

          instruction my aunt and your

          brother and most of our family

          live by. It is what all of the

          village believe ...or try to.

          Charles. Must our children be

          revolutionaries at nine years of

          age. Write to him with your

          concerns - our concerns - about

          the manner of the punishment but

          please do not set yourself

          against him. Think of my feelings

          on this. I beg you.

Finally his outrage has spent itself, neutralized by her

gentle persistence and the deep affection he holds for her.

                    DARWIN

          You're right of course.... I'm

          sorry.

He embraces her.

Emma is reassured, she cannot see the conflict written all

over Darwins face.

                                                              47

65   INT. STUDY. DAY. (THE PRESENT)                                65

     The conflicted expression has hardened, the furrows in

     Darwin's brow etched deeper, as he dips his pen and begins

     the second chapter.

     From the floor below we can hear Emma practising a piece of

     music on the piano - Chopin's revolutionary etude: a

     rippling, brooding arpeggio running up and down the

     keyboard, redolent of an angry sea.

     Darwin's pen scratches doggedly over the paper.

66   INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT.                                          66

     In the bedroom, in his nightgown, Darwin scrubs the ink

     stains off his fingers with a pumice stone.

     Emma passes behind him, preparing for bed. He glances at

     her in the mirror

                         DARWIN

               You're still angry with me.

                            EMMA

               No. Why?

                         DARWIN

               I can always tell by your

               playing.

                         EMMA

               Not angry. I'm sad.

67   INT. DARWIN'S STUDY. THE PRESENT. DAY                         67

     Darwin sits at his desk, writing and editing, his hand

     clamped on the pen.

     A voice speaks from nowhere

                         ANNIE

               Talk to her.

                         DARWIN

                   (still writing)

               And say what? She does not want

               to hear it.

                         ANNIE

               Then write to her.

                         DARWIN

                   (irritably)

               That is what I am doing Annie, I

               am writing all of it.

                                                            48

68   EXT. DARWIN'S STUDY. DAY                                    68

     Emma, passing the open door glimpses Darwin talking angrily

     to himself as he writes.

                         DARWIN

               ....and then she can read it, and

               we can all be free of this! Now,

               please, Annie no more

               interruptions!

69   EXT. GARDEN. DAWN                                           69

     The music continues, louder.

     A frosty coating of dew covers the lawn.

     Footprints lead to a strange wooden tower in the garden.

     Parslow stands outside, shivering in the grey morning

     light.

     Darwin shouts from inside.

                         DARWIN

               Pull!

     Parslow pulls a lever.

     There's the sound of crashing water, a yell of pain from

     inside the tower.

     Ravens rise, calling, from the surrounding trees.

70   INT. DARWIN'S STUDY. THE PRESENT. DAY                       70

     Darwin dips his pen, scores out some text from his previous

     draft and writes again.

     The music continues from downstairs, louder and more

     insistent than before.

71   LOUNGE ROOM. THE PRESENT. DAY                               71

     Emmas hands race back and forwards along the piano

     keyboard.

72   INT DARWIN'S STUDY. THE PRESENT                             72

     Darwin's pen scratches across the pages, making a noise

     like fingernails on a blackboard.

     The music from downstairs seeming to drive into his skull

                                                           49

     He speaks aloud the words he is writing, in an effort to

     drown out the piano music.

                              DARWIN (THOUGHT VOICE)

                  ... In time small variations become

                  extreme...

     Strange detailed drawings of barnacles are strewn across

     his desk, seeming to change and transmute before his eyes.

                            DARWIN (V.O.)

                  ...Organs change their very

                  function, the oviduct becomes a

                  cement gland.

     He stops. His hand is shaking too much to write.

                            ANNIE

                  What's an oviduct?

                            DARWIN

                  Nothing that need concern you.

                            ANNIE

                      (sulkily)

                  I know what it is anyway.

     Darwin gets up abruptly from his desk.

73   INT. WATER TOWER. DAY                                        73

                             DARWIN

                  Pull!

     Darwin stands naked, clutching to two hand rails for

     support as a great tub of freezing water tilts and pours

     its contents on top of him.

     Darwin yells

74   EXT DOVECOTE                                                 74

75   INT. STUDY                                                   75

     Darwin dips his pen and writes

                            DARWIN

                  ....What was once a free-

                  swimming creature now finds

                  itself glued by its head to a

                  legs...,

                                                             50

     The Revolutionary etude is continuous now - real or

     imagined.

76   UNDER THE SEA                                                76

     Surf crashes.

     Underwater, among the swirling seaweed, fragile sea

     creatures being torn this way and that by the raging surf

77   INT. MALVERN SPA TREATMENT ROOM. DAY                         77

     Annie screams and kicks her legs, overwhelmed by water in

     some dark place.

     Pull back to reveal:

78   INT. HELL.                                                   78

     A vision of hell:

     The water is fire.

     The barnacles are people.

     The people are Annie, Emma and Darwin.

79   INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT                                          79

     Darwin wakes in a panic and sits up in bed. He raises his

     right arm and looks down at his inky writing hand

     fluttering in the moonlight, like an organ with a will all

     of its own

     Emma is a sleep. There's a crucifix on the wall above her

     bed. On the bedside table there's a bible.

                            EMMA

                  " ...About the midst of this

                  valley I perceived the mouth of

                  hell to be; and it stood also

                  hard by the wayside. Now, thought

                  Christian, what shall I do?

80   INT. NURSERY. THE PRESENT. NIGHT                             80

     The children are gathered around Emma who is reading a bed-

     time story to them by lamplight.

     Emma is in the centre of a circle of little attentive

     faces.

                                                            51

     She's aware of Darwin, standing in the darkened corridor

     beyond the door, drawn to the cosy little group but unable

     to join it.

     She lets him be. Continues reading

                         EMMA

               And ever and anon the flame and

               smoke would come out in such

               abundance with sparks and hideous

               noises, that he was forced to put

               up his sword, and betake himself

               to another weapon, called "All

               Prayer"..."

81   INT. ETTY'S ROOM NIGHT.                                      81

     The older girls Etty and Betty finish their prayers and

     jump into bed in their night-gowns

     Emma comes in to take away their lamp.

                          ETTY

               Is Daddy not coming to kiss us

               good-night

                         EMMA

               He is still a little bit ill from

               working ...maybe tomorrow.

                         BETTY

               That's what you said last night.

     Emma turns out the light. In the darkness Etty says.

                         ETTY

               I think when Annie died he

               stopped loving us.

     Emma returns to her bedside

                         EMMA

               Oh come now, Etty. You know

               that's not true. He is just a

               little bit ill - and a little bit

               busy.

82   INT. BOILER ROOM. DAY                                        82

     In the bowels of Down House the house, we find Darwin

     wrapped in wet towels sweating in front of the wood-burning

     stove.

     As he gazes into the leaping flames, Annie appears at his

     shoulder.

                                                             52

                           ANNIE

                 Is there really such a place as

                 hell.

                           DARWIN

                 No of course not. How can there

                 be?

                 If he is supposed to be loving

                 and forgiving - what on earth is

                 the sense punishing all these

                 millions of souls.

                           ANNIE

                 But just suppose if there was.

                 And all this was punishment.

                             DARWIN

                 All what?

     No reply.

                           DARWIN

                 I don't know what you mean. All

                 what?

83   INT THE WATER TOWER. DAY                                     83

     Darwin stands, legs apart in the water tower bracing

     himself like a colossus against the full force of the

     deluge.

                             DARWIN

                 Pull!

84   EXT THE WATER TOWER. DAY                                     84

     The gardener, splitting logs, watches Darwin stagger from

     the tower with a rug wrapped around him, and make his way

     back to the house.

85   INT. DARWIN'S BEDROOM. DAY.                                  85

     Darwin lowers himself into bed, inky and tousled. He seems

     prematurely aged, crippled by the gruelling process of

     writing the book.

     As he lies there, unable to sleep lines of written text

     seems to appear behind his closed eyes, or in the tangled

     vines of the wallpaper.

     Emma speaks from the other side of the bed.

                           EMMA

                 Talk to Mr Innes. Please. You are

                 clearly not well

                                                              53

                         DARWIN

               He is what? A physician now

                         EMMA

               You know what I mean. I think he

               can help you.

     Charles remains stubbornly silent, his hand fluttering over

     the coverlet.

                          EMMA

               I am taking the children to Maer

               for a while, to visit their

               cousins.

                   (Beat)

                I worry for you, Charles. Please

               talk to him

86   INT DARWIN'S STUDY. DAY                                       86

     Fire flares in the grate as Darwin compares the skeletons

     of various pigeons.

     He starts a new Chapter: "changes under domestication"

87   INT. THE DOVECOTE. THE PRESENT. DAY                           87

     Pigeons mate and coo in the dusty twilight.

88   EXT. THE DOVECOTE. THE PRESENT. DAY                           88

     Parslow picks up two of them, casually wrings their necks

     and heads off with them to the skeletonizing shed.

89   INT. DARWINS STUDY. THE PRESENT. DAY                          89

     Darwin Looks out of the study window, searching for

     inspiration.

     He sees Emma and the children getting into a coach with

     their baggage.

90   INT. DARWIN'S STUDY. THE PRESENT. NIGHT.                      90

     Darwin sits at his desk.

     He has written the chapter heading and nothing else.

     Parslow knocks and looks in

                         PARSLOW

               Will you be eating sir.

                                                           54

                         DARWIN

               No thank you.

     Parslow leaves. Darwin addresses the empty room.

                         DARWIN

               Annie? .....Annie.

     She will not come.

91   EXT. THE BEACH.    THE PAST. DAY                             91

     Annie dancing in the surf. One minute she is there and the

     next she has vanished, lost among the churning waves.

     Darwin leaps top his feet shouting

                            DARWIN

               Annie!

     Raucous male laughter takes us to

92   INT. PUBLIC HOUSE. THE PAST. EVENING.                        92

     The George and Dragon on a Saturday night. The air loud

     with laughter and thick with pipe smoke.

     Clodhoppers crowd the snug, many of them roaring drunk,

     with their florid complexions, stained and broken teeth.

     Darwin trying, to slip in discreetly is spied by a group of

     locals who hail him and gather around him, wedging him into

     a corner with their overloud loud talk and laughter.

                         THATCHER

               Mr Darwin! Mr Darwin! I was

               explaining to Mr Goodman here

               your interest in breeding. Mr

               Darwin is our foremost scholar in

               the village.

                         DARWIN

               No. No I am but one of many.

               There is Squire Lubbock, and the

               reverend Innes

     The Thatcher waves them away as lesser talents.

                         THATCHER

               ....he is also a noted explorer,

                         THATCHER

               Mr Goodman, now, is the foremost

               pigeon fancier in all the

               southern counties. Kent champion

               two years running. I swear he can

               give you any beak or plumage in

               four generations. Head and tail

               in five.

                         DARWIN

               How do you do it?

                         GOOODMAN

               By breeding cousin with cousin. I

               find it the fastest way to alter

               the strain - provided you do not

               weaken it in other ways.

     Darwin takes a slug of whiskey

93   INT. DARWIN'S STUDY.   THE PRESENT. NIGHT                     93

     He is drinking in his office.

     The clock strikes twelve. The page in front of him remains

     stubbornly blank

     Darwin is rising from his desk when he sees something move.

     In one of the bottles on his desk, a fleshy marine specimen

     seems to have come to life.

     It writhes blindly in its bottle of formalin, making a

     sound like a baby crying.

     Darwin, recoiling in horror, pushes himself back from his

     desk. The castors on his chair trundle back from his desk.

     Behind him he hears a tapping and turns to see that all the

     birds in his big glass display case of Galapagos finches

     have started to beat against the inside the crowded glass

     case. They flutter, frenzied, tapping with their beaks on

     the inside of the glass, which shatters as...

     One by one the bottled specimens explode, discharging their

     contents onto the floor.

     A lamp falls over. The room is filled with birds the floor

     awash with formalin and broken glass.

                                                           56

     The Study seems to tilt like the cabin of a ship in a storm

     and.

94   INT. DARWIN'S BEDROOM. THE PRESENT. DAWN                     94

     Darwin wakes from the nightmare asleep at his desk, the

     whiskey bottle a quarter empty, ink on his hands and his

     shirt cuffs

     He gets up and puts on his shoes.

95   INT. DOWN HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM. THE PRESENT. DAWN .           95

     The scullery maid, lighting the fire, looks round and sees

     Darwin.

     He walks past her without a word and heads out into the

     garden.

96   EXT. DOWN HOUSE GARDEN. THE PRESENT. DAWN                    96

     Darwin heads across the lawn, takes a key from his belt and

     opens the door of the skeletonizing shed.

97   INT. SKELETONIZING SHED. THE PRESENT. DAWN                   97

     In the grey light he takes in the corpses of doves from the

     dovecote.

     Some have been skinned, their pelts curing on frames, their

     carcasses steeping in a buckets chemicals which remove the

     flesh from the bones.

     Previously he regarded this place as a sort of laboratory.

     Now it seems a place of horror.

     The door opens behind him. Its Parslow.

                         DARWIN

               Get rid of them.

                         PARSLOW

               Which ones sir?

                         DARWIN

               All of them. All of it.

98   INT. DOVECOTE. THE PRESENT. DAWN                             98

     Darwin reaches into the dovecote and starts grabbing

     pigeons at random, dragging them out and flinging them into

     the air.

                                                               57

                            DARWIN

                Go. Go!

99    EXT. DOWN HOUSE. THE PRESENT. DAWN.                           99

      Displaced doves beat the air.

      Darwin climbs down the ladder, grabs and axe and attacks

      the wooden stanchions supporting the dovecote

      Parslow comes running over from the skeletonizing shed,

      calling:

                          PARSLOW

                Sir. Mr Darwin.

      Darwin stands back, hair wild, eyes crazed, his sleeves

      covered in bird shit.

                          PARSLOW

                Please rest sir. I'll have John

                Lewis remove it. Have some

                breakfast now and rest. Shall I

                call the doctor?

                            DARWIN

                God know.

                          PARSLOW

                Or the water tower.

                          DARWIN

                A pox on all of them!

100   INT. ANNIE'S ROOM. THE PAST. DAY                              100

      The local doctor Henry Holland takes out various

      concoctions from his medical bag and arranges them on the

      dresser.

      We are in the past. Annie is in bed with a fever.

      Emma is pregnant.

                          DOCTOR

                Calomel then, twice daily.

                          DARWIN

                I will not give it to her.

                    EMMA                             DOCTOR

      Charles....                        Mrs Darwin, it is nothing but

                                         chloride of mercury. I have

                                         prescribed it often in

                                         children as young as two.

                                                      58

                    DARWIN

          Not to any of mine I hope. On the

          Beagle I dropped some on a

          microscope slide and all my

          animacules died of it.

                    DOCTOR

          Well animacules are not persons.

          Presumably they would die if you

          dose them with Madeira wine.

                    DARWIN

          On Madeira they thrived most

          excellently, as did Captain

          Fitzroy, while it lasted.

Annie enjoys the joke and gives Darwin a weak smile. The

doctor regards her balefully

                    DOCTOR

          Or if she would submit to be

          bled.

                       ANNIE

          Please no.

                    DARWIN

          I will write to Dr Gully again.

                    DOCTOR

              (sceptical)

          The hydro-therapist?

                    DARWIN

          I have always found his

          treatments most effective.

                    DOCTOR

          ...no matter that they defy all

          sense of logic.

He is packing up his bottles and his lancets

                    DARWIN

          Logic is not everything.

Emma shoots him a look. Til now scientific logic has been

his guiding principle.

                    DOCTOR

          Then I shall bid you good day.

                    DARWIN

          Parslow will bring your carriage.

          I will be down presently

The doctor leaves the room. Emma is in a terrible quandary

                                                            59

                          DARWIN

                I should take her to Malvern.

                          EMMA

                I think it is better she is here.

                          DARWIN

                Gully can care for her properly

                there. She can be treated daily,

                as I was.

                          EMMA

                Charles no. She is better with

                us. With her family. Please do

                not take her away from me.

101   INT. DARWIN'S STUDY. THE PRESENT. DAY                       101

      Parslow enters to find his master staring vacantly into

      space.

      The page in front of him is still blank.

      The study is in chaos. It seems as though the contents of

      the black box have multiplied and spread out to colonize

      every corner of the room.

                          PARSLOW

                Post for you sir.

      He leaves it by Darwins elbow and backs out.

      After a while Darwin seems to rouse himself.

      He picks up the largest envelope, postmarked Malaysia, and

      slits it with a letter knife.

      The sender is a Mr Wallace. There's a covering letter and a

      twenty page attachment Darwin reads, and lets out a sudden

      loud bellow of laughter.

                           DARWIN

                Ha!!

102   EXT. DOWN HOUSE. THE PRESENT. DAY.                          102

      Darwin sits in sunshine at the rear of the house, rugged up

      against the cold. Looking frail still, but oddly at peace.

                          INNES

                Ah, there you are Mr Darwin.

      Darwin looks up blinking in the sunlight to see the stocky,

      dark-suited figure of Mr Innes.

                                                      60

                    INNES

          May I join you.

                    DARWIN

          By odd means

He makes some space on the bench. Innes hesitates, unable

to read Darwin's feelings towards him. The smile is

welcoming enough but there is something not altogether

balanced about it

                    INNES

          Mrs Darwin informed me you would

          be alone and ....perhaps a need

          to counsel.

He sees an envelope on the ground and stoops to retrieve

it.

                    INNES

          You dropped this. What a

          beautiful postage stamp.

                    DARWIN

          Yes. It is from the Spice

          islands.

                    INNES

          I do rather envy your wide circle

          of correspondents. In my youth I

          always wanted to travel.

                    DARWIN

          You are still young. You could be

          a missionary and follow in Mr

          Livingstone's footsteps.

                    INNES

          Yes, although I have always felt

          there is quite enough evil at

          home without looking for it

          abroad.

              (Then, casually)

          Mrs Darwin told me of the book

          you are writing.

                    DARWIN

          Not any more, thank goodness

                    INNES

          You have finished it?

                    DARWIN

          It has been finished for me. My

          correspondent In the spice

          islands has arrived independently

          at exactly the same idea,

          expressed in a mere twenty pages.

                    (MORE)

                                                      61

                    DARWIN (cont'd)

          There's brevity for you. I had so

          far covered two hundred an fifty

          and come to a dead end. So

          finally I am rid of the project.

Innes is relieved to hear it

                    INNES

          The Lord moves in mysterious

          ways.

                    DARWIN

          He does indeed Mr Innes. I was

          reflecting only the other day on

          the fact that he has endowed us

          in his blessed generosity with

          not one but nine hundred species

          of intestinal worm each with its

          own unique method of infiltrating

          the blood supply and burrowing

          through the mucosa.

Innes shifts uncomfortably.

                    DARWIN

           And then again on the great love

          he shows for butterflies by

          inventing a wasp to lay eggs

          inside the living flesh of

          caterpillars

                    INNES

          Well. It is not for us to guess

          at His reasons.

                    DARWIN

          No. We can leave that for Mr

          Wallace now. Should I advise him

          to stay overseas do you think? If

          he shows his face in Kent he may

          be required to kneel on rock

          salt.

Innes rises. He's a short man, acutely aware of any threats

to his dignity, and he's had enough of this mockery

                    INNES

          I once valued our friendship Mr

          Darwin. I had hoped it might be

          possible to restore it. Clearly

          in your present mood that is not

          going to be possible. My regards

          to Mrs Darwin

He starts off round the corner of the house.

                                                            62

      Darwin listens to his footsteps receding, then turns his

      face back to the sun. When he opens his eyes sees a figure

      standing in the lawn.

      It is Annie, plain as day, scowling at him angrily.

                           DARWIN

                What? I am forestalled by Mr

                Wallace. That is the simple fact

                of it. What reason do you have to

                be angry?!

      She shoots him a look of hatred then turns away from him

      and runs off towards the meadow.

      Darwin, instantly remorseful, gets to his feet and hurries

      after her.

                          DARWIN

                Annie!

      He reaches the centre of the lawn and stopped by a sudden

      intense pain in the gut which strikes him like a blow and

      fells him to his knees.

      He lies their gasping, his vision clouding as the pages of

      the Wallace letter slip from his grasp and are scattered to

      the wind.

      A view from high above: spiralling downwards on the Darwin

      garden, as household servants emerge from various quarters

      and hurry to his assistance.

103   INT. DARWIN'S BEDROOM. THE PRESENT. DAY.                    103

      There are some faint stains on the plasterwork of the

      bedroom ceiling. Like lichen on a rock. Like an archipelago

      of islands.

      Darwin lies, pale and weak, looking upwards from a sea of

      white blankets.

      The door opens and he turns his head. Its Emma.

                          EMMA

                You have a visitor.

                          DARWIN

                No. No. I will not be bled or

                lectured to.

      She gives him a pinched look, then Hooker pushes in behind

      her.

                                                        63

                    HOOKER

          It is me. Thank God you are still

          with us. Word came from London

          you had suffered an apoplectic

          stroke.

                    DARWIN

          No. Simply the great relief of

          liberation. Did you read the

          Wallace abstract.

Hooker bats the idea away

                    HOOKER

          It is a letter. You have a book

                    DARWIN

          ...barely half of it

                    HOOKER

          You have a book. What is not

          already on the page is most

          certainly inside your head and I

          intend to extract it, if it kills

          us both.

                    DARWIN

          You have been talking to Huxley.

                     HOOKER

          No. Had I done so he would have

          hastened here himself armed with

          every instrument of torture known

          to her majesty's navy.

              (Then)

          Charles I have read the first

          Chapters. It is brilliant. You

          must continue.

                    DARWIN

          I cannot. Seriously Joseph, I am

          completely blocked. All my old

          symptoms have returned with a

          vengeance. The sweats the shakes

          the abdominal pains. The whole

          endeavour was cursed from the

          outset.

Hooker takes darwins hand, presses it to stop it from

trembling

                    HOOKER

          Charles. It was you who opened my

          eyes to the wonders of science.

          So let me open yours. You have an

          illness. You have had it as long

          as I have known you.

                    (MORE)

                                                               64

                          HOOKER (cont'd)

                It is clearly made worse in times

                of overwork but the nature of the

                work is irrelevant. This is not

                visited on you by God or the

                devil. This is a set of physical

                symptoms. Go to Malvern and get

                treated.

                          DARWIN

                Not Malvern

                          HOOKER

                Why not. What is there to be

                scared of there. He has worked

                for you in the past it will work

                again. Then come back and finish

                the book. Your enemies are

                already toasting their good

                fortune but they shall not

                prevail.

                          DARWIN

                What are you talking about. I

                have no enemies.

                           HOOKER

                They are legion, believe me, and

                they are implacable. We are all

                of us fighting a battle against

                fear and superstition but we can

                win this battle. We must win it.

                You can win it for all of us. Go

                to malvern, then come back and

                finish it.

104   INT. DOWN HOUSE. THE PAST. DAY.                               104

      Upstairs, Servants are packing for a journey.

      The vigorous Darwin of the past moves swiftly from room to

      room, gathering his things. Hat and gloves, books,

      spectacles, papers.

      Emma, eight months pregnant, tries to keep up with him

                          EMMA

                Charles, please reconsider

                          CHARLES

                Emma it is weeks now, months. She

                is getting worse, not better.

                          EMMA

                Then I am coming with you.

                                                         65

                    DARWIN

          You cannot come. How can you

          possibly come in your condition.

                    EMMA

          It is not so far.

                    DARWIN

          It is two days by coach and

          train. Who will look after the

          others.

                    EMMA

          I do not care for the others. I

          care for Annie!

Etty, coming apon then unexpectedly, hears this and is

instantly heartbroken.

EMMA is devastated by the slip but is presently too

overwrought to retract it.

                    DARWIN

          Leave us please, Etty.

Parslow has gathered up Annie from her room and is carrying

her downstairs, pale and sickly-looking, with Brodie

fussing behind.

                    BRODIE

          Make sure she is tucked in. Watch

          her shawl

                    ANNIE

          I don't need to go.

At the bottom of the stairs, Darwin takes Annie from

Parslow's arms

                    DARWIN

          The coach is outside. I will

          carry her from here.

                     EMMA

          Annie...

                     ANNIE

          Mama...

She clasps Emma's hand. Darwin keeps heading for the door.

Emma holds fast to Annies hand and follows behind

                    DARWIN

          You will see Mamma when you are

          better. Say goodbye now.

                                                                66

      Parslow holds the door open. The coach is at the Gate. Emma

      stops on the threshold, unable to let go her daughters hand

      and suddenly deeply convinced that she is making a mistake

      here.

                          EMMA

                Wait. I am coming with you

                          DARWIN

                Please, Emma

                          EMMA

                Wait there.

      She hurries back inside. Darwin makes a decision and heads

      for the coach.

105   EXT. DOWN HOUSE. DAY                                           105

      Down the patch and through the open gate with the servants

      following.

                          DARWIN

                Get aboard. Brodie

                          ANNIE

                    (shouts back)

                Mama!

      The garden gate clangs shut behind them.

106   INT. DOWN HOUSE STAIRWELL/ UPPER HALLWAY. THE PAST. DAY        106

      Emma looks out of the upstairs window, realizes they plan

      to leave without her and hurries downstairs again.

107   INT. COACH. THE PAST. DAY                                      107

      Charles bundles Annie inside.

                          DARWIN

                    (to the coachman)

                Go. Go.

                          EMMA

                    (calls)

                Wait!

                             DARWIN

                Go now!

                             ANNIE

                Mama!!

                                                               67

      The coach sets off. Emma runs to the gate calling

      desperately.

                          EMMA

                Charles. Please God. No. Annie!

108   INT. COACH. THE PRESENT                                       108

      Charles, feeble and debilitated, levers himself into the

      coach with Parslow assisting and slumps back in the leather

      upholstery.

      Servants gather at the gate. Some of them tearful, not

      expecting him to return

109   EXT. STEAM TRAIN. THE PRESENT. DAY.                           109

      A steam train comes charging past trailing plumes of black

      smoke, striking sparks from the track with its wheels.

110   INT. CARRIAGE. THE PRESENT. DAY.                              110

      The sickly Darwin of the present sits hunched and nauseous,

      with Parslow sitting beside him with his suitcase on his

      lap.

      Every jolt of the train sends a spasm of pain through

      Darwin's guts.

      The people sitting opposite - a woman, a child, and a man -

      regard Darwin in silence. Whatever he suffers from its not

      good and they are worried about getting infected with it

      They plunge into a tunnel. The carriage fills with smoke.

      Parslow gets up and tries to close the window but it won't

      budge. A burning ember flies inside and lands on Darwin's

      leg.

      Darwin is too weak to lift a finger. Parslow slaps the

      ember and extinguishes it.

111   EXT. STATION. MALVERN.                                        111

      The train wheezes to a halt. The doors open and the train

      disgorges its cargo of sick people, come to Malvern for

      treatment - a coughing child, a woman with one side of her

      face aflame with shingles - the halt the lame and the

      afflicted.

                                                               68

112   EXT. HORSE AND CART. DAY                                      112

      Darwin sits in the back as the attendant drives them

      through Malvern.

                          DARWIN

                Tell him not this way.

                          PARSLOW

                    (loudly)

                Hello there. Stop. Can we go by

                the other route

                          ATTENDANT

                The Worcester Road is shorter.

                          DARWIN

                ...by the low road.

                          PARSLOW

                He wishes to go by the other

                route.

                          ATTENDANT

                    (with a sigh)

                As you will sir.

      He backs up the horses and turns the cart around

113   INT. GULLY'S CLINIC. DAY                                      113

      Dr Gully is the chief physician at Malvern spa. His marble-

      tiled consulting rooms resound with the sound of rumbling

      pipes and dripping water.

      Darwin reclines on a leather couch, watching the watery

      play of light on the ceiling.

      A door opens and Dr Gully comes in, accompanied by two

      assistants.

      Gully is a small dapper man wearing an apron over his shirt

      and tie. His trousers are tucked into calf-length

      Wellington boots.

      He greets Darwin cheerfully, effusively.

                          MR GULLY

                Mr Darwin, old friend. Mr Darwin.

                It has been too long I fear. Tut

                tut tut tut tut. What have we now

                what have we now?

      He clasps Darwin's hand, feeling his pulse at the wrist,

      then commands him to open his mouth

                                                       69

                      GULLY

          tongue...

Darwin shows him.

                    MR GULLY

          Ugh. Shirt up. Let me feel your

          liver.

Darwin untucks his shirt. Gully prods at Darwin's belly.

Darwin winces.

                    DR GULLY

          Pulse hectic, togue furred, liver

          tender and enlarged.

Darwin's ink stained fingers speak volumes.

                    DR GULLY

          No doubt you have been exercising

          your brain every hour that God

          gave you.

                    DARWIN

          I was persuaded to write book.

                    DR GULLY

          Madness there are far too many of

          those already. Are you Sleeping?

                      DARWIN

          Poorly.

                    DR GULLY

          I suppose never taking the 50C

          dilution of Chelidonium.

                    DARWIN

              (shakes his head)

          I had the gardener build a water

          tower. It no longer has any

          effect.

                    GULLY

          Of course not. Your gardener is

          not a hydrotherapist. What on

          earth possessed you ?

                    DARWIN

          I feared I was dying.

                    DR GULLY

          Oh come come come. We shall not

          have that talk here.

Half turning to his assistant, who is staking notes.

                                                              70

                          GULLY

                A smart spinal scrub. Cold douche

                daily at 7.00. Wrapping in towels

                and sweating by the lamp.

      Then, to Darwin:

                          DR GULLY

                No red meat, no reading, no

                mental agitation of any kind. We

                shall soon have you right old

                friend, we shall have you right.

114   INT. TREATMENT ROOMS. DAY                                    114

      Music over:

      Darwin sits in a deep metal bath while one of Gully's

      assistants scrubs his spine with a loofah.

115   INT. DOUCHE. DAY                                             115

      Darwin stands in a shaft of light, grabbing onto the hand

      rails as the icy flood continues to crash down on his

      shoulders, splintering and fracturing in the shaft of

      light.

116   INT. TREATMENT ROOMS. DAY                                    116

      Two assistants bind him tight in damp linen sheets, til he

      is immobilised like a cocoon, with his legs together and

      his hands by his side.

      They pick him up and lie him down, quite rigid beside

      another pod like creature, similarly swaddled, with a red

      face and a beard.

                          BEARDED STRANGER

                Mr Darwin is it?

      Darwin nods, unable to turn his head, or make any gesture

      with his hands.

      The stranger continues to talk to him nonetheless.

                          BEARDED STRANGE

                William Carter of Southampton. I

                read your Beagle account many

                years ago. Former naval man

                myself. What brings you here?

                Myself, a Bilious fever with

                blood per rectum, but I have

                every faith in Gully. The man is

                a miracle worker.

                                                            71

117   INT. TREATMENT ROOM. DAY                                    117

      Darwin sits with a blanket draped over his shoulders, under

      the merciless glare of a heat lamp.

      Sweat pours off him and forms puddles at his feet.

118   EXT. TERRACE. DAY.                                          118

      A bright sunny day. Darwin, looking weak but purged, sits

      on the terrace, sipping a glass of foul-tasting mineral

      water and looking out over the stone houses, fields and

      valleys of Malvern.

      Gully sits with him, interviewing him.

                          GULLY

                What action do you most associate

                with the symptoms. Eating? Strong

                emotion? Strenuous Excercise?

                          DARWIN

                Does the exercise of memory count

                as an action.

                          GULLY

                Memory of what.

                          DARWIN

                My eldest daughter. You remember

                her.

                          GULLY

                Of course. Of course. You must

                accept there was nothing more we

                could do.

                          DARWIN

                I know that. I know.

      A long, awkward silence, neither of them wants to

      recapitulate the events of Annies death.

                          GULLY

                You say you were writing about

                her.

                          DARWIN

                No. It is a scientific text. But

                I had reached a point, beyond

                which it was impossible to

                progress. She had been my

                companion throughout. Now it

                seemed she was ahead of me in a

                place I could not follow.

                                    72

          GULLY

Of course. Plainly she is in

heaven.

          DARWIN

That is what my wife believes. It

is a great consolation to her

          GULLY

But not to you.

          DARWIN

Emma and I have become ...divided

on it.

           GULLY

Does it affect your marital

relations.

          DARWIN

We have none ...to speak of.

          GULLY

    (a beat)

Are you familiar with the

writings of DeQuincy."There is no

such thing known to the mind as

forgetting."

          DARWIN

I don't know what it means.

          GULLY

He suggests we have thoughts

which do not actually enter the

realm of consciousness. Nervous

fibres exist after all throughout

the whole body. Is it not

possible that certain primal

feelings manifest in some

physical way. Eczema. Boils. A

fever. Might some blocked passion

imitate a gall-stone? Or even

manufacture one.

          DARWIN

Well, until someone devises a

machine to read nervous impulses,

or a telescope to look inside

the body I suppose we can only

guess at it.

          GULLY

We can Mr Darwin. We can look

inside you. If you find yourself

open to it, there is a way of

seeing.

                                                               73

119   EXT. STREETS OF MALVERN. NIGHT                                119

      Darwin wanders the cobbled streets of Malvern, pausing

      occasionally to consult a hand-written address.

      It is starting to rain as, finally, he arrives at the

      address he is looking for. A substantial terraced house.

      Darwin descends a stone staircase to the imposing front

      door, and rings the bell.

      As he waits for an answer a woman appears, unseen in the

      rain streaked window above, observing him.

      Darwin rings again. A moment later the woman answers the

      door.

                          DARWIN

                Mrs St John?

                          MRS ST JOHN

                Mr Darwin. Come in.

120   INT. MRS ST JOHN HOUSE. NIGHT                                 120

      The room is large and hot, crowded with pot plants, and

      bric- a-brac. Various fringed lamp-shades, a dancing Shiva,

      a framed picture of Lourdes, and some illustrations from

      the Tarot. None of this inspires Darwin with confidence.

                           ST JOHN

                Just leave your coat on the

                table. Sit down here. Show me

                your palm.

      The husky voice and the plunging decollete troubles Darwin,

      who hesitates.

                          DARWIN

                Sorry. I'm confused. What is it

                you do exactly.

                          MRS ST JOHN

                I envision what's inside your

                belly, dear. That's what you

                wanted, isn't it.

                          DARWIN

                Envision how? When Gully

                described you I fancied some

                scientific instrument....

                          MRS ST JOHN

                Depends what you class an

                instrument. In more resistant

                cases I might use a pendulum...

                                                            74

      He frowns. She smiles.

                          MRS ST JOHN

                Its ten shillings for a reading

                by the way. In advance.

                          DARWIN

                Well. I have a ten shilling note

                here in my wallet.

      He doesn't take it out.

                          DARWIN

                If you can tell me the numbers on

                it we can begin.

      Mr St John' face hardens.

                          MRS ST JOHN

                    (coldly)

                I'm a professional lady Mr

                Darwin. I don't do party tricks.

                          DARWIN

                I am a professional man. And I

                asking for no more than I ask of

                all my colleagues - a

                demonstration of competence.

                          MRS ST JOHN

                It is you who are here to be

                tested, Sir, not me.

                           DARWIN

                Then I am sorry to have wasted

                your time.

      He puts his jacket back on and heads for the door.

121   INT. HALLWAY. NIGHT.                                       121

      Mrs St John follows him. As he reaches for the doorhandle,

      and opens it, she says:

                          MRS ST JOHN

                She's with you, you know that.

      Darwin turns.

                           MRS ST JOHN

                Your little girl. I saw her from

                the window standing at the top of

                the steps.

                          DARWIN

                How dare you.

                                                               75

                             MRS ST JOHN

                Pardon?

                          DARWIN

                ...prey on people's grief like

                this.

                          MRS ST JOHN

                I have done no such thing.

                          DARWIN

                    (furious)

                Do you take me for an idiot?

                Clearly Gully has appraised you

                of my history.

                          MRS ST JOHN

                I beg to inform you he did no

                such thing!

                          DARWIN

                It is chicanery of the very

                lowest order and I despise it

                utterly!

                             MRS ST JOHN

                Get out.

122   EXT. THE HOUSE. DAY                                           122

      Darwin steps outside and she slams the door on him. Darwin

      continues to rant at the closed door, standing in the

      pouring rain without his umbrella.

      He gets to the top of the steps, and looks around, trying

      to get his bearings.

      In a pool of lamp-light at the far end of the street a

      figure stands watching him.

      Darwin squints at her through the rain, which is falling

      harder now.

      The figure is Annie.

      She looks at him crossly, then heads off up a cobbled side-

      street.

      Darwin follows.

123   EXT. MALVERN. SIDE STREETS. VARIOUS. NIGHT                    123

      Darwin pursues his daughter up narrow cobbled lanes.

                          DARWIN

                Annie. Annie!

                                                               76

      The rain is getting heavier, turning the gutters into

      rivers.

      Water overflows the drains and culverts and rushes over the

      cobbles, making them slick and treacherous.

      Darwin hurries down darkened lanes and alleys, the sound of

      rushing water echoing all around, the little girl always

      ahead of him.

      A DRUNK MAN in oilskins comes barreling past him, head

      down, cursing the weather.

      A child's ball goes floating downhill in the current.

      Darwin loses Annie, then he sees her again, at the top of a

      steep flight of stone steps.

      Darwin, drenched chases after her.

124   EXT. WORCESTER ROAD. NIGHT.                                   124

      At the top of the steps he stops for breath and he looks

      around.

      There is no sign of Annie but he knows this street - The

      Worcester Road - a row of Grey Georgian houses, their backs

      against the hill, their sloping front gardens looking out

      over the rooftops of Malvern.

      Most of the street is in darkness but the house directly

      opposite has lights in the window.

      He knows this house also.

      He hesitates, then crosses the street towards it.

125   EXT. GUEST HOUSE. NIGHT                                       125

      Soaked to the skin, he raps with the brass door-knocker,

      then waits for someone to answer.

      Muffled voices. Then a man answers from within.

                          LANDLORD (O.S.)

                Hello?

                          DARWIN

                Is Mrs Carey still the landlady

                here.

                          LANDLORD

                No.

      The door opens on a chain.

                                                            77

                          DARWIN

                My daughter Annie ...lodged here

                some years ago. Can I come in?

      The man closes the door to release the chain, then opens it

      again to admit Darwin.

                          DARWIN

                I know this is an intrusion. I

                wonder - could I visit the room

                she stayed in?

      The landlord doesn't know what to make of this

                          LANDLORD

                Wait here. I'll get the missus.

      He leaves Darwin dripping in the hallway which he goes and

      consults with his wife in the lighted parlour.

      Darwin looks around. This place is all too familiar to him -

      the bevelled gold-rimmed mirror, the carved mock-Tudor coat-

      stand.

      Muffled conversation off.

      There are crutches and walking sticks among the umbrellas.

      Lavender potpourri in a brass dish. A wheel-chair in one

      corner, a picture of the pieta above the door.

      Finally, the land-lady emerges from    her parlour.

                          LANDLADY

                Which room?

                          DARWIN

                Fourteen. I would only be there

                ten minutes. I am happy to pay.

      She goes into an alcove and emerges with a key.

                          LANDLADY

                Up one flight and along the

                corridor to the right.

                          DARWIN

                I remember.

                          LANDLADY

                Try not to touch anything.

126   INT. GUESTHOUSE. THE PRESENT. NIGHT.                       126

      Darwin, climbs the stairs to the Landing.

                                                            78

127   INT. GUESTHOUSE. THE PAST DAY                               127

      The younger Darwin flees up the stairs.

128   INT. GUESTHOUSE. THE PRESENT. NIGHT.                        128

      The older Darwin, reaches the top of the stairs and walks

      along the corridor to the right.

129   INT. GUESTHOUSE. THE PAST DAY                               129

      The younger Darwin, races along the corridor.

130   INT. GUESTHOUSE. THE PRESENT NIGHT.                         130

      The older Darwin, hesitates, chest pounding, outside the

      door of number 14, then unlocks it as...

131   INT. GUESTHOUSE. THE PAST. DAY                              131

      The younger Darwin bursts into room 14 and takes in the

      scene.

      The room is full if light. A maid is bundling soiled

      sheets. Brodie is there with a harrassed-looking Dr Gully.

      They turn as he enters.

      Annie lies on the bed between them, her breathing fast and

      shallow. She manages a weak smile.

                          DARWIN

                Is she any better? Does she want

                for anything?

      Gully stands up from the bed. His expression tells us hope

      is fading. Annie's pale sunken cheeks and caked lips

      confirm it.

      Darwin kneels by her bedside, clasps her little hand is his

      own.

                          DARWIN

                Darling Annie. I am here now.

      Annie lets out a reedy whine of appreciation and strokes

      his lapel "making him beautiful"

      Brodie cannot bear it and bursts into tears.

132   INT. ROOM 14. THE PAST NIGHT.                               132

      Annie sleeps.

                                                              79

      Darwin sits up, writing to Emma, crying as he writes.

                          DARWIN (V.O.)

                Dearest Emma. I think it best for

                you to know how every hour

                passes. It's a relief for me to

                tell you. Whilst writing to you I

                can cry tranquilly.

133   INT. ROOM 14. THE PAST DAY.                                  133

      A local surgeon lays out various instruments, including a

      glass syringe with a long needle.

      Annie struggles and whimpers. Brodie comforts her

                          DARWIN (V.O.)

                Mr Coates the Surgeon came today

                to draw off Annie's water. This

                did not hurt her, but she

                struggled with surprising

                strength against being uncovered.

                          BRODIE

                There there. It will all soon be

                over.

134   EXT. CHURCH AT MALVERN. ENTRANCE. DAY                        134

      Darwin enters through the heavy stone entrance.

135   INT. THE CHURCH AT MALVERN. DAY                              135

      The relatives of the sick, stand or sit among the pews,

      arriving, praying, departing

      Darwin kneels awkwardly in front of the altar, clasps his

      hands together and prays:

                          DARWIN

                Save her. I will believe

                whatever. Forever. Please save

                her

      He looks up at the image of Christ on the cross, hoping

      against all reason, for some sense of epiphany.

      It's not working. He feels nothing embarrassment at the

      cheapness of the gesture.

136   INT GUEST HOUSE. ROOM 14.   THE PAST .NIGHT                  136

      Darwin sits alone with Annie who is babbling incoherently.

      He can't make out anything she says

                                                            80

                          DARWIN (V.O.)

                Our dear child has taken a turn

                for the worse. She talked a great

                deal but we could seldom make out

                anything. Much of what she says

                we cannot make out from the

                roughness of her poor mouth.

137   INT. GUEST HOUSE. ROOM 14 NIGHT                             137

      Dr Gully leaves, the surgeon arrives. The maids squeeze

      between the two medical men, bundling sheets

                          DARWIN (V.O.)

                Today she vomited rather much

                again. Dr Coates has been to draw

                off more water.

      Brodie and the maid roll Annie on her side and cut off the

      tail of her shirt, then roll her on her back again, with a

      pillow between her two bony knees.

                          DARWIN

                Is that good, my lovely

                          ANNIE

                    (suddenly lucid)

                Beautifully good. I am making

                custards.

                          DARWIN (V.O.)

                Gully thinks her in imminent

                danger.

138   INT. DOWN HOUSE. DAY.                                       138

      Heavily pregnant Emma sits in the drawing room, crying and

      reading Darwin's latest letter.

                          DARWIN (V.O.)

                We sponged her with water and

                vinegar, made her sweet with

                chloride of lime....I fear we

                must prepare ourselves for the

                worst

139   INT. ANNIE'S ROOM. GUEST HOUSE. DAY.                        139

      It is midnight Darwin, exhausted, keeps a lonely Vigil by

      Annie's bedside. Each breath seems like it will be her

      last.

      Suddenly she speaks: faintly but audibly:

                                                               81

                          ANNIE

                The rabbit.

                           DARWIN

                What?

                          ANNIE

                The rabbit taught him the polka.

                          DARWIN

                I don't understand my love.

                          ANNIE

                Tell me about Jenny.

      Darwin bends low to hear her more clearly.

                          DARWIN

                What about her.

                          ANNIE

                When she died

                          DARWIN

                I don't want to talk about death

                my love.

                          ANNIE

                But tell me. I like it.

                          DARWIN

                Well. What the keeper told me

                was. When she was very sick with

                pneumonia, lying very still, he

                tried to feed her but she shook

                her head, looking at him as

                though to say: "Its nice of you

                but really you shouldn't bother".

                And as he bent down to take the

                spoon away she brought her arms

                around his neck and kissed him.

                And then she was dead.

      Annie smiles, puts her hands around her fathers neck and

      dies.

140   INT. TRAIN THE PAST DAY                                       140

      Darwin sits, his face wet with tears, reading, through

      blurred vision, a letter from Emma.

                          EMMA (V.O.)

                I was in the garden looking at

                our poor darling's little flower

                bed when John Griffiths drove up

                with your letter.

                                                             82

141   INT. DARWIN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT                                141

      Emma goes to bed, utterly drained.

                          EMMA (V.O.)

                When I went to bed I felt as if

                it had all happened long ago.

                When the blow comes it wipes out

                all that preceded it.

142   INT. DARWIN'S BEDROOM. DAY.                                 142

      She opens the curtains on a bright day. The other children

      are playing in the garden

                          EMMA (V.O.)

                My feeling of longing for our

                lost treasure makes me feel

                painfully indifferent to the

                other children, but I shall get

                right before long.

143   INT. TRAIN CARRIAGE. THE PRESENT. DAY                       143

      Darwin sits in the train, Heading home from malvern.

      He is looking across the carriage at his younger self, re-

      reading the letter and weeping uncontrollably.

144   EXT DOWN HOUSE. LOUNGE. THE PRESENT. NIGHT                  144

      Torrential rain crashes down on the house, the garden, the

      ancient trees and the outbuildings, flooding the path and

      the lane beyond the gate.

      Darwin pays the coachman and hurries inside

145   INT. DOWN HOUSE. LOUNGE ROOM.                               145

      Emma is playing a beautiful slow Nocturne.

      The rain outside drown out all other side.

      She doesn't notice the figure of Darwin until he appears,

      like a ghost, reflected in the polished wood of the piano.

      She turns with a start and sees him, still in his dripping

      coat, hair plastered over his brow

                          DARWIN

                Sorry. I startled you.

                                                      83

                    EMMA

          Take your coat off by the fire

          there. What time is it?

Darwin stays where he is, dripping on the carpet

                    DARWIN

          We need to talk. I need to talk

          to you.

                    EMMA

          Of course, but dry your hair. I

          shall call for a towel.

As she moves to the bell-pull he grabs her wrist

                     DARWIN

          I went back to Worcester Road. I

          saw Annie.

                    EMMA

          Charles. No.

                    DARWIN

          Let me tell you.

                     EMMA

          I don't want to hear it. This

          must stop.

                    DARWIN

          You don't understand.

                    EMMA

          I do! Do you think me deaf and

          blind. You have lived with her

          and spoken with her every day

          since she died.

Parslow comes in with firewood then sees Emma yelling at

darwin and hurriedly retreats, spilling logs in the

hallway.

                    EMMA

          She is more real to you than I

          am. She's dead Charles.

                    DARWIN

          I know that.

                    EMMA

          Then what is wrong with you that

          even our poor daughter cannot be

          left in her grave but you

          would....

                                                      84

                     DARWIN

          I know she is dead. I know it. It

          is you who will not accept the

          fact, preferring to think of her

          in heaven.

This again! The unspoken argument which has been brewing

for a decade, never before expressed so bluntly. Emma heads

for the door

                    EMMA

          Get away from me!

She heads into the hallway, he follows her ranting

                    DARWIN

          Snowy white wings and dancing

          with the angels. Is that your

          idea of honesty.

Servants scramble out of sight and out of earshot

                     EMMA

          Why did you come back. I will not

          hear this!

Emma picks up her skirts and hurries up the stairs. Darwin

pursues her.

On the landing, Betty and Horace, wide eyed and terrified

are bundled into the nursery by Brodie as Charles thunders

up the stair.

                    DARWIN

          You have to Emma, everything

          these was between us is gone.

          The boat is wrecked and sunk now.

          We have to hold to something

          else.

                    EMMA

          To what. Your ghosts? Your

          theories? What Charles.

                    CHARLES

          To the truth of what we know it.

She slams the bedroom door on him and bolts it.

                    DARWIN

          Open this door Emma. The truth,

          how wonderful and extraordinary

          our daughter was....

                    EMMA

              (through the door)

          I know that. I do not need you to

          say it. Of course I know.

                                                      85

Charles throws his shoulder to the door and bursts through

it. Emma screams

                    CHARLES

          But free of the fantasy, free of

          the rest, the silly vain hope

          that we will be reunited in

          heaven and the nagging unspoken

          belief that I killed her!

In the lower hallway all the servants hear this

In the nursery, Brodie, aghast, covers the childrens ears

In the bedroom, Emma has nowhere left to run

                    EMMA

          I have never said that

                    CHARLES

          Say it now. Say it. And all the

          rest that follows. That I should

          have kept Annie warm that day on

          the beach. I should not have

          taken her to Malvern. I should

          have let you come.

Tears spring to her eyes and to his. The fury has gone from

both of them, leaving sadness and pity

                    EMMA

          I should have insisted.

                    CHARLES

          No. It was me. I took her from

          you It was my fault.

                    EMMA

          I could have followed. I was her

          mother what was I thinking of.

                    CHARLES

          We thought she would live. You

          were not to know.

He moves to her, she startles, then lets him enfold her in

his damp coat

                    EMMA

          I did. I did know. I knew when

          you left that I would never see

          her again. I hated you for taking

          her.

                    CHARLES

          I hated myself. I knew that none

          of them could save her.

                    (MORE)

                                                              86

                          CHARLES (cont'd)

                All I could do was watch

                hopelessly and weep for her -

                then flee the place in terror,

                not even waiting to see our poor

                dear daughter buried. She was our

                treasure and I failed her. We

                both did. We should never have

                married each other.

                          EMMA

                What are you saying?

                          CHARLES

                The unspeakable . I am saying

                that you and I, in making our

                perfect child, endowed her with

                the very weakness which killed

                her. Emma. That is what I

                couldn't write. That is what

                forestalled me all these years.

                It wasn't you I was angry with,

                it wasn't Innes and it wasn't

                God. I was angry with my theory.

                It was the truth I was angry

                with. It is the truth.

      Weeping, she shakes her head in furious denial. He kisses

      her hair, her eyes, her tear-streaked cheeks...

146   INT/ EXT BEDROOM, THE PRESENT. NIGHT                         146

      Rain continues to batter the house outside

      Inside Darwin and Emma make love, with a kind of wild

      desperation, their clothes strewn all over the floor,

      clinging to each other like castaways in a storm.

147   INT OFFICE. THE PRESENT. DAY                                 147

      Darwin enters his office. The chaos that existed here

      previously has been tidied away into files and boxes.

      Darwin opens the black box, takes out the files, places

      them on his desk, then sits down and begins to write

148   INT. STUDY. NIGHT.                                           148

      Darwin sits at his desk. Writing. He is possessed of a new

      sense of calm and purpose, the pen gliding fluently across

      the page.

                                                             87

      Night turns to day and then to night again. Darwin

      completes the Chapter headed "variation under

      domestication" and begins on a fresh sheet of paper.

149   EXT. THE GARDEN. DOWN HOUSE. THE PRESENT. DAY               149

      Crocuses are pushing up through the flower beds. Tiny green

      buds have started to emerge from the dead black branches

150   INT. DARWIN'S STUDY. DOWN HOUSE. THE PRESENT. DAY           150

      Still Darwin writes

                          ANNIE

                Tell me a story.

                          DARWIN

                I'm busy Annie.

                          ANNIE

                    (petulantly)

                I'll go away again, then you'll

                be sorry.

                          DARWIN

                All right, come here, come here.

      She comes and sits on his lap.

                          DARWIN

                Once there was a man

                Who, while travelling in South

                America, came apon a beautiful

                and dangerous idea.

151   INT. SOUTH AMERICAN JUNGLES. DAY                            151

      Darwin is in the south American jungle, trying to coax down

      from the trees, some small squeaking creature - a tousled

      looking abandoned chick.

                          DARWIN

                Here, here. Come on, come on then

      The creature draws closer, eyes like gimlets in the dark

      foliage.

                          DARWIN

                ...I wont hurt you.

      He reaches into the dark recesses of the forest. Darwin

      grabs it and stuffs it, squawking into his collecting bag.

                                                               88

152   INT. DARWIN'S STUDY NIGHT                                     152

      Darwin comes in, empties the bag into a black box with

      perforations and closes the lid

                          DARWIN

                He knew his wife wouldn't care

                for this creature so when he came

                home he locked it in a box, where

                it couldn't run around and do any

                damage.

153   INT. DARWIN'S STUDY. DAY                                      153

      Darwin works at his desk. There's a plaintive cooing sound

      coming from the box next to his feet.

                          DARWIN

                But every so often he'd open the

                lid and feed it, just because he

                couldn't bear to let it die.

      Finally he opens the lid and offers the creature a biscuit.

      It has grown a bit larger and made itself a nest. It takes

      the biscuit and peeps gratefully.

154   INT. DOWN HOUSE. DAY                                          154

      Darwin goes to the box and opens it. There's nothing there

      but an empty nest and some broken eggshells.

                            DARWIN

                One day he opened the box and

                discovered it wasn't in there at

                all. It had escaped with all its

                babies, who were nesting all over

                the house making a terrible mess.

155   INT. DOWN HOUSE. DAY. VARIOUS                                 155

      The Darwin's, their children and their servants run around

      the house finding birds everywhere.

      There is bird-shit on the curtains and the antimacassars,

      birds nesting in the sewing basket, the bread bin and the

      dress-up box.

      Every time you open a cupboard, angry birds fly out and

      flap angrily around the room.

      Mayhem. The house is in uproar.

                                                              89

                          DARWIN

                But finally they caught them all,

                and bundled them in a blanket and

                he asked his wife to dispose of

                them as she saw fit.

156   INT. STUDY. CONTUNUOUS                                       156

      Annie listens entranced. Darwin pauses

                          ANNIE

                And what did she do?

                           DARWIN

                I don't know but I fancy she took

                them out in the garden and set

                them free.

157   EXT. DOWN HOUSE. GARDEN DAY.                                 157

      Emma and Brodie come out carrying a huge white linen bag

      between them.

      They shake it out in the garden and birds come pouring out

      of it.

      High shot, looking down on EMMA as she watches the birds

      wheeling round and round in the sky above.

158   INT. DARWIN'S STUDY. DAY                                     158

      Darwin sits in his study window, watching a great flock of

      birds wheeling in the sky outside, the whole flock forming

      an ever-changing shape from the movement of its tiny

      component parts.

159   INT DARWIN'S STUDY. NIGHT                                    159

      Darwin puts down his pen, waking, as if from a dream.

      The manuscript is finished.

      The music of Chopin filters up from downstairs.

160   INT. DRAWING ROOM. DAY                                       160

      Emma is playing by candle-light. Darwin places the

      manuscript on top of the piano.

      She stops abruptly. The last chord resonates in the musky

      air.

                                                            90

                          DARWIN

                Done. I have finally got it out

                of the air and into these pages.

                Will you read it and decide what

                must be done with it. I confess I

                no longer know and I am very

                tired.

      She takes his hand and squeezes it.

161   INT. DOWN HOUSE. BEDROOM.                                   161

      Darwin undresses.

162   INT. DOWN HOUSE   DINING ROOM                               162

      Emma sits at the table and begins to read.

163   INT. DOWN HOUSE. BATHROOM                                   163

      Darwin gets out of the bath and towels himself dry.

164   INT. DOWN HOUSE. DINING ROOM                                164

      Emma lights a candle from the one before and continues to

      read.

165   INT. DOWN HOUSE. BEDROOM. NIGHT.                            165

      Charles lowers himself into the bed, sleep washes over him

      like a wave.

166   INT. DOWN HOUSE. DINING ROOM. NIGHT.                        166

      Still Emma reads.

                          DARWIN (V.O.)

                Thus, from the war of nature,

                from famine and death, the most

                exalted objects we can conceive

                directly follow. There is a

                grandeur in this view of life

                ...in which endless forms most

                beautiful and wonderful have been

                and are being evolved.

      Outside the sky is growing lighter.

167   INT. DOWN HOUSE. BEDROOM. DAY.                              167

      Charles wakes.

                                                              91

      He opens the curtains on a clear autumn day. The house is

      unusually quiet.

168   INT. DOWN HOUSE. TOP OF THE STAIRS. DAY.                     168

      The grandfather clock on the landing strikes mid-day.

      Darwin goes downstairs.

169   INT. DRAWING ROOM. DAY.                                      169

      He enters the drawing room. There is no sign of Emma nor of

      his manuscript.

      He goes to the window and sees her at the bottom of the

      garden standing over a bonfire, burning something.

170   EXT. GARDEN. DOWN HOUSE. DAY.                                170

      Darwin goes outside.

                             DARWIN

                Emma?

      She looks up from the fire. Darwin crosses the lawn to her.

      She's burning leaves and dead-heads from the flower garden.

                          DARWIN

                Did you read it?

                             EMMA

                Yes.

                             DARWIN

                And....

                          EMMA

                I wrapped it and put it on the

                table there.

      There's a brown paper parcel on the garden table where they

      like to sit under the big Cyprus tree.

      Darwin picks it up, it is addressed to John Murray,

      Publisher, stamped and sealed with sealing wax.

                          EMMA

                You're right. True or not it must

                all be said. Probably most of it

                is true. God help us.

      Darwin kisses her.

                                                            92

                          EMMA

                Careful. I have soot all over my

                hands.

171   EXT. BOTTOM OF THE DRIVE.                                   171

      Darwin stands with the brown paper package, turning it over

      in his hands.

                          DARWIN (V.O.)

                Dear Hooker, I have today

                despatched to John Murray the

                completed manuscript. Who knows

                if anyone will buy it and how

                they will respond. No doubt many

                will wish al diabolo altogether.

                But least it is out in the world

                now and no longer torturing me.

      John Griffiths, the postman, comes up the hill from the

      village.

      Darwin gives him the manuscript. The Postman puts it in his

      satchel and heads on up the lane.

      Darwin turns back and walks up towards the house.

      As he does so a little figure, Annie takes his hand, and

      together they continue on home, Annie skipping happily by

      her father's side.

172   POST-SCRIPT.                                                172

      Darwin's "Origin of Species" was sold out on its day of

      publication.

      A classic to this day, it was reprinted six times before
