1   AN ENDLESS SKY AT TWILIGHT                                  1

    Foreboding. Heat lightning in the distance. Miles of

    unforgiving, summer-scorched prairie.

              ..."Life is very long..."

2   MILES OF STRAIGHT ROAD                                      2

    Two lanes, not a car in sight. Cracked asphalt undulates over

    gentle, browned hills, disappears into an infinite horizon.

                        BEVERLY (OS)

              TS Eliot. Not the first person to say

              it, certainly not the first person to

              think it.

3   A LAKE IN THE GATHERING DUSK                                3

    Flat, still. An empty aluminum rowboat lolls listlessly,

    tied haphazardly to an old wooden dock.

                        BEVERLY (OS)

              But he's given credit for it because

              he bothered to write it down.

4   AN OLD FARM HOUSE SITTING ATOP A LOW HILL                   4

    At the end of a long gravel road.   Surrounded by towering

    black walnuts and lace-bark elms.   A farm once, no one's put

    a plow to earth here in decades.

                        BEVERLY (OS)

              So if you say it, you have to say his

              name after it. "Life is very long:" TS

              Eliot. Absolutely goddamn right.

    Wrap around porches, forgotten gardens. Imposing in the

    gathering gloom. A single downstairs window glows.

                        BEVERLY (OS) (CONT'D)

              Give the devil his due. Very few

              poets could've made it through Eliot's

              trial and come out, brilliantined and

              double-breasted and Anglican.

    And now, a face fills the screen --

5   INT. BEVERLY'S DIMLY LIT STUDY - TWILIGHT                     5

    BEVERLY WESTON. A craggy, wise and deeply sad Okie.    We take

    a long moment, just to study that face.

                           BEVERLY

                 Not hard to imagine, faced with

                 Eliot's first wife, lovely Viv, how

                 Crane or Berryman might have reacted,

                 just foot-raced to the nearest bridge;

                 Olympian Suicidalists.

    Stares out the window at the darkening, ominous horizon.

                           BEVERLY (CONT'D)

                 Not Eliot: after sufficient years of

                 ecclesiastical guilt, plop her in the

                 nearest asylum and get on with it.

    He sits   at a cluttered desk, his face damp with sweat. Nurses

    a glass   of whiskey, his staggered delivery due more to his

    careful   selection of words than drunkenness. He's talking to

    someone   we do not yet see.

                           BEVERLY (CONT'D)

                 God-a-mighty. You have to admire the

                 purity of the survivor's instinct.

    From somewhere upstairs, a THUD. He looks to the ceiling.

                           BEVERLY (CONT'D)

                 Violet. My wife. She takes pills,

                 sometimes a great many. They affect...

                 among other things, her equilibrium.

                 Fortunately, they eliminate her need

                 for equilibrium...

6   INT. VIOLET'S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT                              6

    Full of shadows. She sits up slowly from rumpled sheets.

    We're on her profile, CLOSE, silhouetted against the faint

    light from the open bathroom door. She hesitates on the edge

    of the bed, getting her bearings. Finds a pack of Winstons,

    lights one. Listens to the voices filtering up from below.

7   INT. THE STUDY - TWILIGHT                                       7

    Beverly shifts, waiting for the sound of more movement from

    the rooms overhead. When there is none --

                        BEVERLY

              My wife takes pills and I drink.

              That's the bargain we've struck.

                                                 INTERCUT WITH:

8   INT. VIOLET'S BEDROOM/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - TWILIGHT               8

    She gathers herself to stand. Moves to the door. We FOLLOW

    HER CLOSELY. Her hair unkempt, her steps unsteady, into --

                        BEVERLY

              The reasons why we partake are

              anymore inconsequential.

    The hallway, walls lined with photos of long-dead pioneer

    ancestors and faded school photographs of three daughters.

                        BEVERLY (CONT'D)

              The facts are: my wife takes pills and

              I drink. That's the bargain we've

              struck, just one paragraph of our

              marriage contract... cruel covenant.

              And these facts have over time made

              burdensome the maintenance of

              traditional American routine.

    She makes her way to the stairs starts down.

                        BEVERLY (CONT'D)

              Rather than once more vow abstinence

              with my fingers crossed in the queasy

              hope of righting our ship, I've chosen

              to turn my life over to a Higher Power

              and join the ranks of the Hiring

              Class.

    The light from the study slices across the living room.

                        BEVERLY (CONT'D)

              It's not a decision with which I'm

              entirely comfortable. I know how to

              launder my dirty undies. Done it all

              my life, but I'm finding it's getting

              in the way of my drinking.

    She can see a portion of Beverly's desk, a woman's legs.

                           BEVERLY (CONT'D)

                 Sorry about the heat in here. My wife

                 is cold-blooded and not just in the

                 metaphorical sense. She does not

                 believe in air-conditioning... as if

                 it is a thing to be disbelieved. I

                 knew your father, you know. Bought

                 many a watermelon from Mr Youngblood's

                 fruit stand. He did pass, didn't he??

                             JOHNNA

                 Yes, sir.

                           BEVERLY

                 May I ask how?

                           JOHNNA

                 He had a heart attack. Fell into a

                 flatbed truck full of wine grapes.

                           BEVERLY

                 Wine grapes. In Oklahoma.   I'm sorry.

                             BEVERLY

                 Yes?

                           VIOLET

                 Did you pullish? Did you...Oh, goddamn                *

                 it... did. You. Are the police here?

                             BEVERLY

                 No...

    She stands in the shadows of the living room, confused.

                           VIOLET

                 Am I looking through window? A window?

                           BEVERLY

                 Can you come here?

    She steps into the study, emerging from the darkness into

    light to reveal: VIOLET WESTON. Dissipated, dishevelled,

    late sixties. She wears pajamas and a much slept-in robe.

                             VIOLET

                 Oh.    Hello.

    She's staring at a woman sitting in front of Beverly's desk:

    JOHNNA. Thirty, Native American, simply dressed.

                 You tell me she's a woman. Wo-man.

                 Oh, you hire women's now the thing.

                 I thought you meant the other woman.

                 I myself require very little

                 attention, thrive without it, sort

                 of a human cactus. My wife has been

                 diagnosed with a touch of cancer, so

                 she'll need to be driven to Tulsa for

                 her final chemotherapy treatments.

                 OxyContin in a pinch. And of course

                 Diluadid. I can't forget Diluadid.

     We're underwater. Light fractures and scatters above. The

     surface undulating gently as we GLIDE through a lake's

     dark, tenebrous waters on a moonlit night.

     A rowboat SLIPS across our field of vision. It's aluminum

     hull cutting through the calm above, sending out small waves

     as it makes it's way SLOWLY past.

     Oars dip in on either side, propelling the small craft toward

     deeper water. It slows. Stops. Bobs gently. We wait, watch --

     And then suddenly, something large hits the surface above,

     indistinct, exploding the calm, coming towards us, sinking

     fast as TITLES END --

10   A SHAPE                                                        10

     Prone, silhouetted against a sunlit window across the room.

     A body, her back to us. The phone RINGS. Once, twice. The

     body doesn't move. A girl's voice calls from downstairs.

                               JEAN (OS)

                  Mom...?

     The phone continues to RING. Still no movement.

                               JEAN (OS) (CONT'D)

                  Mom...!

     Nothing. The ringing stops. A moment of silence, followed by

     irritated teenage footsteps on the carpeted stairs.

                  ...Mom...?

     JEAN, fourteen, precocious, sticks her head in.

                         JEAN

               ...Mom?

     A sound from the body, still no movement.

                         BARBARA

               Mmm...

                         JEAN

               If it's your father, tell him to

               fuck off.

                         JEAN

               It's Aunt Ivy in Oklahoma.

     New deal. She sits up. CLOSE ON: BARBARA FORDHAM, late-

     forties, fully dressed. She gropes for the phone.

                         BARBARA

               ...Ivy? ...what's wrong?

     Barb stands, moves slowly to the window. Outside: identical

     suburban homes, neutral house colors, lawns.

     We STUDY Barb as she listens. Greying roots, no make-up, a

     few extra pounds. A woman who, for reasons we don't yet

     understand, has decided to stop giving a damn.

                         BARBARA (CONT'D)

               ...When...?

     Jean passes in the hall. Stops, watching as her mother slowly

     dissolves, reaches for the sill, lowers herself to sit.

12   INT/EXT. WESTON HOUSE (PAWHUSKA, OKLAHOMA) - DAY             12

     A battered Honda Civic makes it's way up the long drive from

     the highway below, dust swirling behind it. It's hot. Bright.

     The Honda parks. IVY WESTON, forties, shy and soft-spoken,

     attractive enough but expert at hiding it, climbs out.

     Stares up at the trees surrounding the old farm house. The

     precarious old barn out back and untended flower beds.

     Johnna washes a dish at the sink. Watches Ivy's arrival

     through the kitchen window. Makes no motion to go to her --

14   INT. THE WESTON HOUSE - DAY                                  14

     Ivy steps into the dark house.   Drapes drawn, lights off.

                          IVY

               Mom...?

                    (no answer)

               Mom?

     Steps into the open door of her father's study. His vacant

     desk chair, untouched papers, dust mots settling in the

     sunlight. She takes a moment, then heads upstairs. CARRYING

     US with her. Finds Violet, in her bedroom, sitting in front

     of her vanity in near darkness, smoking and on the phone.

                         VIOLET

               ...You've been out there...?

     Barely acknowledges Ivy's arrival. The room is unruly. Bed

     unmade. Clothes draped over chairs. Dresser and night-stands

     cluttered with pills, tissue boxes, creams and lotions.

                         VIOLET (CONT'D)

               ...You're going out yourself...?                        *

     Ivy wanders into the bath. More pills, wet towels on the

     floor. She turns off the dripping faucet. Picks up towels.

                         VIOLET (CONT'D)

               Stop that...

     Violet is off the phone, standing in hall, watching Ivy. Ivy

     stops, briefly chastened. Violet opens a bottle of pills.

                         VIOLET (CONT'D)

               You call Barb? What'd she say?

                  nothing. I told your mother, "You

                  pack that son-of-a-bitch's bags and

                  have `em waiting for him on the front

                  porch."

               Where's your mother?

                           IVY

               Upstairs.

                         CHARLIE

               They've always had trouble, Ivy.

                         MATTIE FAE

               He'll come back again, I know he will,

               he always does. Beverly is a very

               complicated man.

                         IVY

               Kind of like Charles.

                         CHARLIE

               Yes, like Little Charles. Exactly --

                          MATTIE FAE

               Oh.   He's nothing like Little Charles.

                         CHARLIE

               She just means in their sort of quiet

               complicated ways --

                         MATTIE FAE

               Little Charles isn't complicated,

               he's just unemployed.

     The phone begins to RING.   Ivy eyes it apprehensively.

                         CHARLIE

               He's an observer.

                         MATTIE FAE

               All he observes is the television.

                   (and)

               Why is it so dark in here?

                         CHARLIE

               So you can't even see Ivy's point?

               That Little Charles and Beverly

               share some kind of... complication.

                         MATTIE FAE

     The phone STOPS.    Violet's answered it upstairs.

                            CHARLIE

                  Are you saying our boy isn't smart?

                  Hell, yes, I'm sweating, it's ninety

                  degrees in here.

                            MATTIE FAE

                  Feel my back.

                            CHARLIE

                  I don't want to feel your back.

                            MATTIE FAE

                  Sweat is just dripping down my back.

                            CHARLIE

                  I believe you.

                  Feel it.

                  No.

                  Sweat's just dripping...

     Mattie Fae pulls back a set of drapes, finds the light is

     blocked by shades sealed with tape.

                            MATTIE FAE (CONT'D)

                  Ivy, when did this start? This

                  business with taping the shades?

                   Is it that long since we've been here?

                   tell if it's night or day.

                             IVY

                   I think that's the purpose.

      Ivy goes, Charlie notices Mattie Fae pulling off tape.

               You've encouraged that.

               after two days. So she went to the

               pet store and raised hell and they

               gave her another parakeet. That one

               died after one day.

                  this serial parakeet killer was doing

                  to bump off these birds.

     They head for the house with suitcases, wilting in the heat.

     Jean enters behind her parents, stands sheepishly.

                            MATTIE FAE

                  Oh my gosh, will you look at this one?

                  Shh, it's okay, I'm here.

     Ivy appears at the top of the stairs, watches her mother in

     her sister's arms. Bill turns to Charlie, quietly:

                            BILL

                  No word then?

                  CHARLIE                         MATTIE FAE

     Johnna is cutting off sprigs of wild mint entangled in the

                  some, he walked out the door, this

                  door right there. Got into his

                  That's when I got worked up about

                  that safety deposit box.   We kept an

                  awful lot of cash in that box, some

                  expensive jewelry. I had a diamond

                  ring in that box appraised at seven

                  thousand dollars --

                  Well, I know what you'll say about

                  this, but, your father and I had an

                  urge-ment... arrangement. If

                  something were to ever happen to one

                  of us, the other one would go empty

                  that box.

                  The money and jewelry gets rolled into

                  the estate, bank seals the box until

                  probate is settled. Can take months.

     Johnna places pieces of pie in front of Bill and Barb.

                  Yes.

                  No. And we fought enough... you

                  know... but no, he just left.

                            BARBARA

                  Maybe he needed some time away

                  from you.

                  You knew he was the smartest one in

                  the room, knew if he just said

     Ivy enters with her coffee cup, runs water in it at the sink.

     Outside, her mother, sister, and Bill on the back porch.

                            BILL

                  You can't think of anything unusual --

     Johnna sits at the kitchen table behind Ivy. Johnna stands,

     joins Ivy at the sink. Ivy hadn't seen her there.

                            VIOLET

                  He hired this woman. He didn't ask me,

                  just hired this woman to come live in

                  our house. Few days before he left.

                            BARBARA

                  You don't want her here.

                            VIOLET

                  She's a stranger in my house. There's

                  an Indian in my house.

     Ivy looks to Johnna, embarrassed. But Johnna just takes

     Ivy's cup from her, finishes cleaning it.

                            BILL

                  You have a problem with Indians,

                  Violet?

                            BARBARA

                  Why's it so hard to call people --

                            VIOLET

                  Let's just call the dinosaurs "Native

                  Americans" while we're at it.

                            BARBARA

                  She may be an Indian, but she makes

                  the best goddamn apple pie I ever ate.

     Johnna smiles, nods to Ivy.       Leaves the kitchen.

                            VIOLET

                  He hired a cook. It doesn't make any

                  sense. We don't eat.

                  And now you get biscuits and gravy.

                  Nice for you, now. But you'll be gone

     Ivy eavesdrops at the sink, unsure if she should stay or go.

                  Because you're "dutiful."

                  I don't care about you two. I'd like

                            BARBARA

                  Well, you're seeing her now.

                            VIOLET

                  But your father. You broke his heart

                            BARBARA

                  That is wildly unfair.

     Bill stands, picks up a plate, pushes his way back into the

     kitchen. Ivy hears him coming, but doesn't have time to

     escape. Goes to the refrigerator instead.

                  BILL                             VIOLET

     Am I going to have to             You know you were Beverly's

                                       don't know that.

     Barbara follows Bill. Ivy finds iced tea, pours herself

     some. Tries to make herself invisible -- it's not hard to do.

                            BARBARA (CONT'D)

                  I'd prefer to think my parents loved

                  Santy Claus brought you presents at

                  than one child, you'd know a parent

                  always has favorites. Mattie Fae was

                  my mother's favorite. Big deal. I got

     Finds Johnna on her bed in the small ascetic attic room,

     reading T.S. Eliot. Jean KNOCKS on the open door.

                         JEAN

               Hi, again... Am I bugging you?

                         JOHNNA

               No, do you need something?

                         JEAN

               No, I thought maybe you'd like to

               smoke a bowl with me?

                         JOHNNA

               No, thank you.

                          JEAN

               Okay. I didn't know.

                   (beat)

               Do you mind if I smoke a bowl?

                          JOHNNA

               I.   No, I --

                         JEAN

               Mom and Dad don't mind. You won't

               get into trouble or anything.

     Johnna is clearly a bit uncomfortable. But:

                          JOHNNA

               Okay.

                         JEAN

               Okay. You sure?

     From her pocket, Jean takes a glass pipe and a bud.

                            JEAN (CONT'D)

                  I say they don't mind. If they knew

                  I smuggled this on the plane? And sat

                  there sweating like in that movie

                  Midnight Express. Did you see that?

                            JOHNNA

                  I don't think so.

                            JEAN

                  I just mean they don't mind that I

                  smoke pot. Mom kind of does. I think

                  cause Dad smokes pot too, and she

                  wishes he didn't.

                      (smokes, offers pipe)

                  You sure?

                               JOHNNA

                  Yes.   No.    I'm fine.

     Jean notices a framed photo on the night stand.

                            JEAN

                  Wow, are those your parents?

                            JOHNNA

                  Mm-hm, their wedding picture.

                            JEAN

                  Their costumes are fantastic.    Are

                  they still together?

                            JOHNNA

                  My father passed away last year.

                              JEAN

                  Oh.    Sorry.

                            JOHNNA

                  That's okay. Thank you.

                            JEAN

                  Were you close?

                  Yes.   Very.

                            JEAN

                  My Mom and Dad are separated now.

                  I'm sorry.

                   he didn't give Mom a chance to respond

                   or anything. What sucks now is she's

                   some heroin addict or shoot everybody

                   at school. Or God forbid, lose my

      Bill stands in Beverly's empty study. Absorbing the room, the

      man, the stillness. Picks at the papers on the desk without

      specific purpose. Turns to one of the many bookcases,

      eventually finds a book, smiles.

27    EXT. WESTON HOUSE FRONT PORCH - NIGHT                           27

      Barbara sits on the front steps. It's dark now, but still

      very hot. Moths bat at the porch lights. Bill comes out              *

      carrying a Coke, shares it with Barb.                                *

                   I'd forgotten about the lightning

                   bugs.

      Around the yard, flitting in and out of the low hanging

      boughs of the trees.

                             BILL

      She turns, he holds a thin hardback copy of Meadowlark.

                  I don't remember a hardback edition.

                            BARBARA

                  It wasn't that big a deal.

                            BILL

                  In those circles, it was.

                            BARBARA

                  Those are small circles.

     He opens the book, perusing the first pages.       Reads.

                  "Dedicated to my Violet." That's nice.

                  Christ, probably every word he wrote

                  after this he had to be thinking,

                  "What are they going to say, are they

                  Just turned out the light. You'd

                  think at some point, you just write

                  something anyway and who cares what

                  My father didn't write anymore for a

                  was not one of them, hard as that may

                  I've copped to being a narcissist.

        Jean sees her father coming, hears his footsteps approaching

        across the wooden porch below, the screen door opens quietly.

        She slips back into her room and bed, but he doesn't stop.

        We're on the old wooden dock, watching a man walking away

        from us toward an aluminum rowboat tied haphazardly to the

        dock in the moonlight. He leans down to untie the boat,

        looks back at us, directly into camera -- Beverly.

        Now we're traveling BELOW the surface of the lake, through

        its dark, tenebrous waters on the moonlit night. The

        rhythmic SLAP of gentle waves. We're underwater, light

        fractures and scatters above us. We've been here before as --

        A rowboat SLIPS across our field of vision.   It's aluminum

        bottom cuts through the calm above.

        Oars dip on either side, propelling the small craft. It

        slows. Stops. Bobs gently. We wait, watch --

        Until, suddenly, something hits the surface above, exploding

        the calm, coming at us fast, sinking.

32      INT. THE ATTIC - NIGHT                                        32

        Johnna wakes with a start. Sits up, listens intently.

33      EXT. WESTON HOUSE - NIGHT                                     33

        Johnna steps out onto the second floor porch balcony, finds a

        police car approaching in the distance, headlights cutting

        through the dark country night.

34/35   INT. WESTON HOUSE STAIRWAY - NIGHT                        34/35

        Barefoot, Johnna quietly descends the stairs. Approaches the

        front door, left open to let in the cool night air. Undoes

        the screen door latch. Steps outside.

        Watches the car arrive. The driver's door opens, a sheriff

        gets out, silhouetted against the police flashers behind him.

36   INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER                       36

     Barbara, bleary-eyed, moves quickly down the dark hall in

     her robe. Bill follows in his boxers and T-shirt, pulling

     on pants. Barb goes to Vi's door, KNOCKS.

                           BARBARA

               Mom?

     She opens the door. Over her we FIND: Violet, entombed in

     her room. Squinting against the intrusive hall light.

                         BARBARA (CONT'D)

               Mom, wake up, the sheriff's here.

                         VIOLET

               Did you call them?    I dig in call

               them.

                           BARBARA

               Mom.    The sheriff is here.

                          BILL

               Come on.   Leave her there.

     Barbara does, starts for the staircase, meets the just

     awakened Jean coming out of her room, concerned.

                         BILL (CONT'D)

               Go back to bed, sweetheart....

     Barbara descends the stairs, trailed by Bill. The SHERIFF

     waits on the porch, late-forties, handsome, Stetson in hand.

     They go to him, but WE HANG BACK with Jean, watching the

     scene outside unfold. Bill shakes the Sheriff's hand. The

     Sheriff speaks earnestly to Barbara and Bill.

     We can't hear what's being said, only murmurs until --

     Barbara sinks to her knees. Bill holds her. Jean watches.

37   INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                         37

     Johnna enters, snaps on the light, starts a pot of coffee.

     Stoic, inscrutable.

38   EXT. WESTON HOUSE DRIVEWAY - JUST BEFORE DAWN                38

     A big pre-dawn sky is changing from black to blue. The

     Sheriff walks to his cruiser, kills the flashers. Bill joins

     him, still barefoot.

                         BILL

               What happened?

                         SHERIFF

               Couple old boys running jug lines in

               the lake hooked him. Pulled him up.

                         BILL

               He drowned. That's how he died, from

               drowning?

                            SHERIFF

               Looks it.     Yes, sir.

     Bill looks off.   Song birds begin their pre-dawn chatter.

                         BILL

               Is there any way to determine if

               he... I mean is this an accident,

               or suicide --?

                         SHERIFF

               There's really no way to tell.

                         BILL

               What's your guess?

                         SHERIFF

               ...Suicide.

     And now the full weight of it hits Bill. After a moment --

                         BILL

               How does a a person jump in the

               water... and choose not to swim?

39   INT. WESTON GIRL'S BEDROOM - PRE-DAWN                        39

     Barb pulls on clothes, rakes a brush through her hair. Jean

     appears in the door, watches her. After a moment:

                  What about Aunt Ivy?

                            BARBARA

                  I guess we'll stop on the way.

                  Christ, I need to call Karen, too.

                  Why the fuck am I brushing my hair?

     She drops the brush. And then an odd sound intrudes from

     downstairs, a song: "Lay Down, Sally" by Eric Clapton.

40   INT. LIVING ROOM - PRE-DAWN                                  40

     The music is LOUD. We follow Barbara and Jean halfway down

     the stairs to REVEAL: Violet, high as a kite, doing a jerky

     little dance by the stereo. The Sheriff stands uncomfortably

     by the door, his hat in hand. She shuffles over to him.

                            VIOLET

                  Izza story. Barely's back.    Did sum

                  Gizza cig... some cigezze?    Cig-zezz,

                  cig-zizz... cig-uhzzz...

     She laughs at her inability to speak. He takes a Pall Mall

     from his shirt pocket, hands it to her. Lights it for her.

                            VIOLET (CONT'D)

                      (and)

                  Mm, good beat, right?

     He nods.   Bill comes back in from outside.

                            VIOLET (CONT'D)

                  Barbara?! Is Barbara here?!

                      (quietly)

                  Right here, Mom...

     Johnna steps in from the kitchen, pensively observing.

     Violet abandons her dance, separates invisible threads in the

     air. The others stand frozen, staring at her.

41   EXT. SKIATOOK LAKE ROAD - DAWN                               41

     The sun's just topped the horizon, throws long early shadows

     across the flat expanse of prairie. Scattered trees, a

     ribbon of asphalt leading to a distant lake, telephone poles.

     We're HIGH ABOVE the country road, following the Sheriff

     cruiser below. Barb's rental sedan trails behind.

                            BARBARA (OS)

                  I used to go out with that boy.

                  That man.

42   INT. RENTAL CAR (MOVING) - EARLY MORNING                     42

     Bill drives, Ivy up front with him. Barbara sits in the back

     with Jean. Watches the sheriff's car ahead.

                            JEAN

                  What man? The Sheriff?

                  In high school. He was my prom date.

                  You're kidding.

                            BARBARA

                  Day of the prom, his father got

                  drunk and stole his car, stole his

                  own son's car, went somewhere, Mexico.

                  Deon showed up at the door. He'd been

                  crying. Confessed he didn't have a

                  way to take me to the prom.

     The cruiser slows, pulls through a pipe gate and over a

     cattle-crossing, heads for a small collection of emergency

     vehicles parked around a brush-strewn cove. Bev's old Chevy

     pick-up truck sits to one side.

                            BARBARA (CONT'D)

                  So we got a six-pack and broke into

                  the chapel, stayed up all night

                  talking and kissing. Now here he

                  is, showing me --

                      (fights her emotions)

                  It's so surreal. Thank God we can't

                  tell the future. We'd never get out

                  of bed.

     The cars stop.    The Sheriff gets out.

                            BILL

                  Let me go first, see what they need.

     Bill goes.    Barb fixes Jean with a look.

                            BARBARA

                  Listen to me: die after me, all right?

                  I don't care what else you do, where

                  you go, how you screw up your life,

                  just... survive. Outlive me, please.

     They watch the men. A resolute Bill returns to get Barbara

     and Ivy. The sisters climb out, follow him to the water's

     edge. Jean waits a moment, then steps out of the car.

     Watches her father lead her mother down the small cracked

     concrete boat ramp to where the Sheriff waits by a covered

     body. As the Sheriff pulls back the tarp --

43   INT. A STERILE ROOM - DAY                                    43

     White walls, bright overhead light. We're CLOSE on a man's

     pale, lifeless hand. Another hand enters frame with a

     sponge, begins cleaning off the mud, filth.

44   EXT. WESTON HOUSE - DAY                                      44

     The Weston clan walks to Beverly's Lincoln, Bill, Jean. Barb

     and Ivy help a distraught Violet. All wear mourning black.

45   INT. THE STERILE ROOM - DAY                                  45

     Beverly's sodden shoes are removed, his socks.

     His limp, greyish arm is guided into a starched white shirt-

     sleeve. The buttons carefully buttoned.

46   INT. BEVERLY'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY                               46

     Bill drives. Jean beside him. Barbara and Ivy sit in the back

     seat, flanking Violet. They ride in silence. We study their

     faces, the brown countryside outside.

     Bill notices something in his rearview, a red speck, coming

     up fast, very fast. A sports car.

     It's suddenly right behind them, filling his mirrors. It

     waits for a semi loaded down with massive circular hay bales

     to pass in the opposite lane, then --

     ROARS around. A Ferrari, it's throaty V-10 RUMBLING as it

     SCREAMS past, accelerates down the road. Bill and Jean

     exchange a look, watch it disappear.

47   INT. THE STERILE ROOM - DAY                                     47

     Strong male hands lift Beverly's now dressed body carefully

     and place it into the casket. Adjust the pillow, comb his

     hair into place, fold his hands across his chest.

     We never see his face, never see his whole body. Only these

     small, intimate pieces.

48   INT/EXT. CAR/FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH OF PAWHUSKA - DAY             48

     A few mourners enter the church as Bill pulls in to park,

     discovers the Ferrari already there. A woman emerging.

     Mattie Fae and Charlie are waiting for them, start over as

     Violet emerges into the blinding sun. Recoils slightly.

     Mattie Fae catches her, whispers comforts into her ear, helps

     her toward the church steps.

     We stay back, watching the Westons enter the church --

                  I spent so    much time in our bedroom

                  pretending    my pillow was my husband

     Barbara drives, Karen beside her. Heat radiates off the

     road. They follow Charlie's Caddie, Vi and Ivy visible in

     the Caddie's back seat window ahead of us.

                            KAREN

                  I mean I'd kiss my pillow, and then

                  I'd tell him I'd been to the doctor

                  that day and I'd found out I was

                  pregnant. I know how pathetic that

                  sounds, but it was innocent enough.

                  Then real life takes over, cause it

                  always does --

     Here comes the red speck in the rearview again. The Ferrari

     ROARS up behind them, pulls around to pass, HONKS as it

     goes. Barb catches a glimpse of Jean in the passenger seat,

     Bill jammed into the tiny back seat.

                  Things don't work out like you

                  husband than any real man I'd ever

                  met; this parade of men fails to live

                  up to your expectations, all of them

                  so much less than Daddy or Bill. You

                  punish yourself, tell yourself it's

                  your fault you can't find a good one.

                  me a cunt, I'd think "No, love is

                  forever, so here's an opportunity to

                  make an adjustment in the way you

                  view the world."

     The AC isn't working, Barb's sweating, rolls down her window,

     let's the wind whip her hair around.

                            KAREN (CONT'D)

                  And thank God one day I looked in the

                  mirror and said, "Moron," and walked

                  out, but it kicked off this whole

                  period of reflection, how hard I had

                  screwed it up, where'd I go wrong.

                  That's when I got into those books

                  and discussion groups --

                            BARBARA

                  And Scientology too, right, or

                  something like that --?

                            KAREN

                  Exactly, and finally one day, I threw

                  it all out, I said, "It's me, just me

                  with my music on the stereo, my glass

                  of wine and Bloomers my cat. I don't

                  need anything else, I can live my life

                  with myself." I got my license, threw

                  myself into my work, sold a lot of

                  houses, and that's when I met Steve.

     Charlie slows, signals, turns onto the gravel road leading to

     the Weston house. Barb follows, Karen still going strong --

                            KAREN (CONT'D)

                  That's how it works, you only find

                  it when you're not looking, you turn

                  around and there it is: Steve. Ten

                  years older than me, but a thinker,

                  and he's just so good. He's a good

                  man and he's good to me and he's good

                  for me.

                  The best thing about him, for me, is

                  that now what I think about is now.

                  I live now. My focus, my life, my

                  world is now. I don't give a care

                  about the past anymore, the mistakes

                  I made, the way I thought. And you

                  can't plan the future cause as soon

                  as you do, something happens, some

                  terrible thing happens --

                  That's exactly what I mean. You take

                  it as it comes, here and now! Steve

                  had a huge presentation today for some

                  big-wig government guys who could be

                  important for his business, something

                  he's put together for months, and as

                  soon as we heard about Daddy, he

                  cancelled his meeting. He has his

                  priorities straight. And you know what

                  the kicker is?

                      (beat)

                  Do you know what the kicker --?

     Barbara heads for the fan on the dresser, flips it on.

                            BARBARA

                  What's the kicker?

                  We're going to Belize on our

                  honeymoon!

     Barb sticks her face into the fan. Karen watches, what?

                  Sorry.   Hot flash.

     Steve joins Jean, leans against the car. Throughout the

     following they watch Bill shop for wine inside.

                  You're bad --

     Bill hustles out of the store, carrying several bags.

                            BILL

                  No Pinots, but they had some decent

                  California Merlots.

     Crawls into the car. Steve grins to Jean over the roof of

     the car, climbs in behind the wheel.

54   INT. VIOLET'S BEDROOM - DAY                                     54

     The closet is mostly empty now, the bed overflowing with

     discarded clothes. Mattie Fae nurses a cocktail, hands a             *

     photo to Violet.

                  Look at me.

                      (shows photo to Ivy)

                  Look at me.

                            IVY

                  You're beautiful, Mom.

                            VIOLET

                  I was beautiful. Not anymore.

              MATTIE FAE                               IVY

     Oh, now --                           You're still beautiful.

                            VIOLET (CONT'D)

                  One of those lies we tell to give us

                  comfort. Women are beautiful when

                  they're young and not after. Men can

                  still preserve their sex appeal into

                  old age. Not those men like you see

                  with shorts and those little purses

                  around their waists. Some men can

                  maintain a weary masculinity. Women

                  just get old and fat and wrinkly.

                            MATTIE FAE

                  Think about the last time you went to

                  the mall and saw some sweet little gal

                  and thought she's a cute trick. What

                  makes her that way? Taut skin, firm

                  boobs, an ass above her knees.

                            MATTIE FAE

                  I'm still very sexy, thank you very

                  much.

                            VIOLET

                  You're about as sexy as a wet card-

                  board box, Mattie Fae, you and me

                  both. Look, wouldn't we be better off

                  if we stopped lying about these things

                  and told the truth? "Women aren't sexy

                  when they're old." I can live with

                  that. Can you live with that?

                            MATTIE FAE

                  What about Sophia Loren? What about

                  Lena Horne? She stayed sexy till

                  she was eighty.

     Violet finds something else in the closet for Ivy to try.

                            VIOLET

                  The world is round. Get over it.

55   EXT. WESTON HOUSE - AFTERNOON                                   55

     The Ferrari ROARS up the drive. Jean jumps out, races into

     the house. Bill and Steve emerge, grab the wine.

                            STEVE

                  No, we maintain the accounts off-

                  You know, it's essentially security

                  work. The situation in the Middle East

                  is perpetually dangerous, so there's a

                  tremendous amount of money involved.

                  Security work. You mean... mercenary?

     Bill and Steve enter. Barbara's in the dining room with

     Karen and Mattie Fae setting the table. Goes for the men.

                  Give.   Me.     The wine.

     She pulls a bottle of Merlot from Bill's grocery bag. Hears

     something, looks into the living room as she passes. Jean

     has just turned on the TV, LOUD. Barbara stares for a beat.

                  Let me make sure I've got this: when

                  you threw a fit about going to the

                  store with your dad... Hey, look at

                  me.

                      (Jean does)

                  And you were so distraught over the

                  start time of your Grandpa's funeral.

                  Was this your concern? Getting back

                  here in time to watch Phantom of the

                  Fucking Opera?

                             JEAN

     Barb gives Jean a withering look, exits. Bill takes the wine

     from Steve, follows. Steve lingers, watching the TV.

     We're inside the bus, sitting next to a man, LITTLE CHARLES,

     thirty-seven, rangy and awkward. He stares pensively out at

     the passing Pawhuska storefronts as the bus SLOWS, pulls into

     a parking lot next to the bank.

     He spots Charlie, waiting, drinking a Coke. Little Charles

     exhales, stands. Steps reluctantly out into the heat.

                  The power must've gone out. I woke

                  up and the clock was blinking noon.

                  That means the power went out, right?

                  I see how they are. I don't blame

                  them. I'm sorry I let you down, Dad.

                            CHARLIE

                  You haven't let me down. You never

                  let me down. Now listen...you're

                  wrong about these people, they love

                  you. Some of them haven't gotten a

                  chance to see what I see: a fine man,

                  very loving, with a lot to offer. Now

                  hard on yourself.

                  I love you, Dad.

     Barbara bursts out of the back porch screen and into the

     yard, heading to the old barn. Bill follows.

                  She's old enough to exhibit a little

                  character. But that's something you

                  normally learn from your parents.

                  That's a shot across my bow, right?

                  Nice, "Gordian knot," but her fourteen-

                  year-old self might view it differently,

                  might consider it "abandonment" --

                  Sure you can. What happens to you,

                  We're getting married on New Years.

                  one of my dear mother's many gentlemen

                  What do you know about life on these

                  Plains? What do you know about hard

                  I know you had a rotten childhood,

                  Sweet girl, sweet Barbara, my heart

                  breaks for every time you ever felt

                  pain. I wish I coulda shielded you

                  from it. But if you think for a

                  pain that man endured in his natural

                  rotten childhood? That's the crux of

                  the biscuit: we lived too hard, then

                  rose too high. We sacrificed

                  everything and we did it all for you.

                  Your father and I were the first in

                  our families to finish high school

                  and he wound up an award-winning poet.

                   She smuggled Darvocet into the psych

                   Greatest Generation for you. She

                  schemes. Province of teenage girls.

                  I can't imagine anything more

                  delicate, or bittersweet. Some part

                  of you girls I always identified

                  with... no matter how old you get, a

                  woman's hard-pressed to throw off

                  that part of herself.

                      (to Karen, re: hand creme)

                  That smells good.

                  Qualls? Not much story to it. Boy I

                  had a crush on when I was thirteen or

                  so. Rough-looking boy, beat-up Levis,

                  messy hair. Terrible underbite.

                  But he had these beautiful cowboy

                  boots, shiny chocolate leather. He

                  was so proud of those boots, you could

                  tell, way he'd strut around, all arms

                  and elbows, puffed up and cocksure. I

                  decided I needed to get a girly pair

                  of those same boots and I convinced

                  myself he'd ask me to go steady. He'd

                  see me in those boots and say "Now

                  there's the gal for me."

                  Found the boots in a window downtown

                  and just went crazy: praying for those

                  boots, rehearsing the conversation I'd

                  have with Raymond when he saw me in my

                  boots. Must've asked my momma a

                  hundred times if I could get those

                  boots. "What do you want for

                  Christmas, Vi?" "Momma, I'll give all

                  of it up just for those boots."

                  Bargaining, you know? She started

                  dropping hints about a package under

                  the tree she had wrapped up, about the

                  size of a boot box, nice wrapping

                  paper. "Now, Vi, don't you cheat and

                  look in there before Christmas

                  morning." Little smile on her face.

                  Christmas morning, I was up like a

                  shot, boy, under the tree, tearing

                  open that box. There was a pair of

                  boots, all right... men's work boots,

                  holes in the toes, chewed up laces,

                  caked in mud and dog shit. Lord, my

                  momma laughed for days.

     Silence.

                         BARBARA

               Last time I spoke with my father, we

               talked about the state of the world,

               and he said, "You know, this country

               was always pretty much a whorehouse,

               but at least it used to have some

               promise. Now it's just a shithole."

               I think maybe he was talking about

               something else, something more

               specific, personal... this house? This

               family? His marriage? Himself?

               There was something sad in his voice--

               not sad, he always sounded sad --

               hopeless. As if it had already

               happened. As if whatever was

               disappearing had already disappeared.

               And no one saw it go. This country,

               this experiment, America, this hubris:

               what a lament, if no one saw it go.

                         JOHNNA

               Mrs. Fordham, are you going to

               fire me?

               What? No. But I'll understand if

               you want to quit. I mean, there's

               work. And then there's work.

                         JOHNNA

               I'm familiar with this job. I can

               do this job. I don't do it for you

               or Mrs. Weston. Or even for Mr.

               Weston. Right? I do it for me.

     visible out in the waiting room, Karen sitting with her.

                  The chemotherapy and the radiation,

                  -- right --

                  thorough testing, an MRI or CT scan, I

                  believe your mother is showing signs

                            BARBARA

                  Mild Cognitive Impairment?

                            DR. BURKE

                  Brain damage. It may be time to

                  consider placing her in a long term

                  care facility. I'd certainly feel

                  more comfortable knowing she was

                  receiving that level of supervision.

                            BARBARA

                  That would make you comfortable?   You

                  would be comfortable with that?

                  Right. Not "gone" so much as "dead,"

     Ivy suppresses a laugh.       Burke looks at Ivy, confused.

                  So you're thinking that if the

                  three of us cooperated with you on

                  a commitment end-around, we'd be

                  less likely to sue your ass?

                  "Mild Cognitive Impairment?" Are you

     Barbara pulls out the Ziplock bag, throws a pill bottle at

     Dr. Burke, bouncing it lightly off his head.

                  All right, I think --

     Throws another pill bottle at him.

78   INT/EXT. TALLGRASS PRAIRIE PRESERVE/BEV'S LINCOLN - DAY       78

     The sun parched Indian grass and Turkey Toot are wilting but

     stirred by prairie winds. Bev's old Lincoln follows a thread

     of blacktop through the tall grass. Barb drives, Ivy up

     front. Karen's in the back with Violet.

     pulls to the side of the road. Violet gets out quickly.

     We stay with Barbara as she climbs out of the car, stares

     across the road, waiting for Violet, who can be heard

     retching. Karen and Ivy still in the car.

     The sound fades as Barbara contemplates the prairie and for a

     long moment... loses herself, back to this land, to her home.

     Her expression is unreadable, enigmatic.

     Then behind her, out of focus, we become aware of Violet

     running away, across the prairie, through the tall grass.

     Barbara turns, simply to get back in the car, sees Violet

     running through the field.

                             BARBARA

                  Mom?

     Violet keeps running.

                  Goddamn it. Mom!

     Barbara takes off after her. Ivy and Karen climb out, but

     don't follow. Shield their eyes to watch the chase.

     It's an odd sight, the two women, racing through the grass.

     One almost seventy, the other nearing fifty.

     Barbara is slow in her pursuit at first, maybe because of her

     shoes, or maybe because she just feels silly. Then realizes

     that Violet is not stopping... not unless Barbara stops her.

     Violet runs through the tall grass, puts a foot wrong, goes

     down. Barbara catches up, out of breath, collapses. They

     lay on the ground, wheezing, sweating.

                            BARBARA (CONT'D)

                  Where the fuck are you going, Mom?

     And now we see the full beauty of the land, the distant

     horizon, the high cumulous clouds, the endless blue sky.

     Barb and Violet two dots, lost in the unforgiving prairie.

                               BARBARA

                  I'm sorry.

                            VIOLET

                  Please, honey --

                            BARBARA

                  No, it's important I say this. I lost

                  my temper at dinner and went too far.                    *

                            VIOLET

                  Barbara. The day, the funeral... the

                  pills. I was spoiling for a fight and

                  you gave it to me.

                            BARBARA

                  So... truce?

                            VIOLET

                      (laughs)

                  Truce.

     They take a long moment, then --                                      *

                               BARBARA

                  What now?

                            VIOLET

                  How do you mean?

                            BARBARA

                  Don't you think you should at least

                  consider a rehab center?

     Karen turns, realizing they're not following. Should she go

     back to the car? She decides no, continues inside.

                            VIOLET

                  I can't go through that again. No, I

                  can do this. You got rid of my pills,

                  right?

                            BARBARA

                  All we could find.

                            VIOLET

                  I don't have that many hiding places.

                            BARBARA

                  Mom, now, come on.

                            VIOLET

                  If the pills are gone, I'll be fine.

                  Just need a few days to get my feet

                  under me.

                            BARBARA

                  I can't imagine what all this must

                  be like for you right now. I just

                  want you to know, you're not alone.

                  If you need any help --

                            VIOLET

                  I don't need help.

                            BARBARA

                  I want to help.

                            VIOLET

                  I don't need your help.

                              BARBARA

                            VIOLET

                  I don't need your help. I've gotten

                  myself through some... I know how this

                  goes: once all the talking's through,

                  people go back to their own nonsense.

                  I know that. So, don't worry about me.

                  I'll manage. I get by.

     Violet gets out, heads inside.      Barbara watches her go.

80   INT. WESTON HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON                      80

     Ivy finds Little Charles watching television.

                            IVY

                  Is the coast clear?

                            LITTLE CHARLES

                  Never very.

     Ivy waits until Karen passes through, heads upstairs.

                            IVY

                  What are you watching?

                  Can I watch it with you?

                            LITTLE CHARLES

                  I wish you would.

     She sits beside him on the couch.

                            LITTLE CHARLES (CONT'D)

                  I almost blew it last night.

                      (she nods)

                  Are you mad at me?

                                 IVY

                  Nope.

     They hold hands.

                            LITTLE CHARLES

                  I was trying to be brave.

                                 IVY

                  I know.

                            LITTLE CHARLES

                  I just... I want everyone to know

                  that I got what I always wanted.

                  And that means... I'm not a loser.

                                 IVY

                  Hey.    Hey.

     He turns to look at her.

                            IVY (CONT'D)

                  You're my hero.

     He considers this... then breaks into a huge smile, mutes the

     TV, goes to the ancient, oak, electric piano, turns it on.

                            LITTLE CHARLES

                  Come on, help me push the pedal.

     She joins him on the piano bench.

                            LITTLE CHARLES (CONT'D)

                  I wrote this for you.

     He plays, and quietly sings a gentle but quirky love song.

     It's charming, touching.

     She smiles, he smiles back. Midway through, Mattie Fae

     enters, watches for a moment. Then breaks the spell.

                            MATTIE FAE

                  Liberace. Get yourself together,

                  we have to get home and take care

                  of those damn dogs. They've probably

                  eaten the drapes by now.

     Charlie comes down the stairs with their overnight bag.

                            CHARLIE

                  I'm sure the house is fine.

                  Oh, look, honey, Little Charles has

                  got the TV on.

                            LITTLE CHARLES

                  No, I was just --

                            MATTIE FAE

                  This one watches so much television,

                  it's rotted his brain.

                            IVY

                  I'm sure that's not true.

                             MATTIE FAE

                  What was it I caught you watching the

                  other day?

                  more mean thing to that boy I'm going

                  to kick your fat Irish ass onto the

     Ivy and Little Charles go.

                            CHARLIE (CONT'D)

                  I don't understand this meanness. I

                  look at you and your sister and the

                  way you talk to people and I don't

                  understand it. I can't understand why

                  folks can't be respectful of one

                  another. I don't think there's any

                  excuse for it. My family didn't treat

                  each other that way.

                            MATTIE FAE

                  Maybe that's because your family --

                            CHARLIE

                  You had better not say anything about

                  my family right now. I mean it. We

                  buried a man yesterday I loved very

                  much. And whatever faults he may have

                  had, he was a good, kind, decent

                  person. And to hear you tear into

                  your own son not even a day later

                  dishonors Beverly's memory. We've

                  been married thirty-eight years. I

                  wouldn't trade them for anything. But

                  if you can't find a generous place in

                  your heart for your own son, we're not

                  going to make it to thirty-nine.

     He goes. She takes a moment to collect herself, turns to

     follow, finds Barbara standing out in the open kitchen door.       *

                  What?!

                  Did Dad know?

                             MATTIE FAE

                  Yes.   Y'know, I'm not proud of this.

                            BARBARA

                  Really. You people amaze me. What,

                  were you drunk? Was this just some --

                            MATTIE FAE

                  I wasn't drunk, no. Maybe it's hard

                  for you to believe, looking at me,

                  knowing me the way you do, all these

                  years. I know to you, I'm just your

                  old fat Aunt Mattie Fae. I'm more

                  than that, sweetheart, there's more to

                  me than that. I don't know why Little

                  Charles is such a disappointment to

                  me. Maybe he, well, I don't know why.

                  I'm disappointed for him, more than

                  anything. I made a mistake, a long

                  time ago. Okay? I paid for it. But

                  the mistake ends here.

                            BARBARA

                  If Ivy found out, it would destroy

                  her.

                            MATTIE FAE

                  I'm sure as hell not gonna tell her.

                  You have to find a way to stop it.

                  You have to put a stop to it.

81   EXT. WESTON HOUSE BACKYARD - NIGHT                               81

     It's late, the house still. We MOVE through dark rooms,

     drawn to the murmur of SOUND and a faint sound coming from

     outside the kitchen --

                            JEAN (OS)

                  You weren't kidding, this stuff is

                  strong.

                            STEVE (OS)

                  Florida, baby. Number one industry.

                               JEAN

                  Who cares?

     Slowly DISCOVER: Jean and Steve sharing a joint, out by the

     fence. She wears a long T-shirt; he wears sweat pants and a

     sleeveless T-shirt. Both are barefoot.

                            STEVE

                  Number one by far. Want a shotgun?

                      (off her look)

                  You don't know what a shotgun is?

                            JEAN

                  I know what a shotgun is.

                            STEVE

                  Not that kind of shotgun, here. Just

                  put your lips right next to mine and

                  you inhale while I exhale.

                             JEAN

                  Okay.

     He puts the joint in his mouth, lit end first. Their lips

     nearly touch as he blows marijuana smoke into her mouth in a

     steady stream. She nearly chokes.

                             STEVE

                  Hold it.   Don't let it out.

     She finally gasps, exhales, coughs.

                            STEVE (CONT'D)

                  That's a kick, huh?

82   INT. THE ATTIC ROOM - NIGHT                                    82

     Johnna wakes. Listens. Sits up.

83   INT. ATTIC STAIRS/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT                     83

     Johnna makes her way down the attic stairs and into the

     second floor hallway, the whispers below unintelligible.

84   INT. MAIN STAIRCASE/HALLWAY                                    84

     Johnna steps into the main hallway.      Drawn to whispers, and

     giggling from outside in the yard.

                            STEVE (OS)

                  ...Show `em to me... I won't look.

                            JEAN (OS)

                  If you won't look, there's no point

                  in showing them to you.

                            STEVE (OS)

                  Okay, okay... I'll look.

                            JEAN (OS)

                  You're just an old perv...

                            STEVE (OS)

                  Christ, you got a great set. Show you

                  mine if you'll show me yours.

                            JEAN (OS)

                  I don't want to see yours, perv.

     Johnna approaches carefully, can't yet see them.

                            STEVE (OS)

                  You ever seen one?

                            JEAN (OS)

                  What are you doing?

                             STEVE (OS)

                  Nothing.

                            JEAN (OS)

                  You're gonna get us both in trouble.

                            STEVE (OS)

                  I'm white and over thirty.    I don't

                  get in trouble.

     Johnna pushes out the screen to DISCOVER: Steve kissing and

     groping Jean, sliding his hand down between her legs.

     Johnna grabs a shovel leaning against the storm cellar door.

     Jean and Steve, clothes in disarray, quickly separate.

                    JEAN                              STEVE

     Oh my God...                         Ho, fuck!

     Johnna approaches Steve menacingly.

                            STEVE (CONT'D)

                  Hold up there, lady, you don't --

     Johnna SWINGS the shovel, barely misses Steve's nose.

     Bedroom lights above SNAP ON.

                  Hey, goddamn it, careful!

     She swings again, HARD. The shovel SMACKS into the arm he

     puts up to block her smashing his head with the spade.

                            STEVE (CONT'D)

                  Ow, goddamn --!

     He holds his arm in pain. She wades in with a strong swing

     and CONNECTS with his back. He goes down. Johnna stands

     above him, arm cocked, watching for him to try and get up.

     He doesn't. Karen rushes out, sees Steve on the floor.

                            KAREN

                  What happened?!

     He groans, tries to sit up.    Bill and Barbara run in.

                  Jean, what are you doing up?

                  He was messing with Jean, so I

     who's just gotten to his feet. Karen gets between them.

                  Me and Steve, together. Want to

                  give me some grief about that?

                  pointing fingers. Cause I doubt

                  Jean's blameless in all this. And

                  I'm not blaming her, just cause I

                  said she's not blameless doesn't mean

                  I've blamed her. I'm saying she

                  might share in the responsibility.

                  It's not cut and dried, black and

                  know about. I may even have to do

                  some things I'm not proud of again.

                  Cause sometimes life puts you in a

                  corner that way.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)

                  And I am   a human being, after all.

                  Anyway.    You have your own hash to

                  settle.    Before you start making

                  speeches   to the rest of us.

                  Right...

                            KAREN

                  Come January... I'll be in Belize.

                  Doesn't that sound nice?

     Karen pushes past Barb, rolling her suitcase behind her.

86   EXT. WESTON HOUSE AND DRIVEWAY - NIGHT                          86

     Karen bursts through the screen door, rushes down the steps

     to Steve's waiting Ferrari, it's lights already on, engine

     running. Throws her suitcase in the back.

     Barb steps out onto the porch as it reverses, SLAMS into gear

     and accelerates down the drive, spewing gravel as it goes.

     Bill comes out, watches it disappear with Barbara.      Then:

                            BILL

                  I'm taking Jean with me, heading back

                  to Colorado in the morning.

     But Barb's still focused on the distant Ferrari.

                            BILL (CONT'D)

                  She's too much for you right now.

                              BARBARA

                  Okay.

                            BILL

                  I'm sure you'll find a way to blame

                  me for all this.

                             BARBARA

                  Yeah, well...

                      (beat)

                  I can't make it up to Jean right

                  now. She's just going to have to

                  wait until I get back to Boulder.

                            BILL

                  You and Jean have about forty years

                  left to fight and make up.

                  No. Right. I fail. As a mother,

                  as a daughter, as a wife. I fail.

                            BILL

                  No, you don't.

                            BARBARA

                  I've physically attacked Mom and Jean

                  in the span of twenty-four hours. You

                  stick around here and I'll cut off

                  your penis.

                            BILL

                  That's not funny.

     He starts back inside.

                  And I'm never really going to

                  understand why, am I?

     Bill struggles... seems he might have more to say, but then:

                            BILL

                  Probably not.

     Bill goes.    She watches him leave.   Fights back tears.

87   EXT. WESTON HOUSE - DAY                                       87

     A blistering hot late August day. The Weston house sits in

     bucolic, heat-weary silence. The driveway no longer crowded

     with cars. Barb stands nearly where she did the night

     before, in her sweats and robe. Watching yet another car go.

     Their rental, Bill behind the wheel, backing up. Jean in the

     seat beside him. Jean stares blankly at her mother, as she

     rolls past. Bill never looks back.

     The rental heads down the drive, passing Ivy's Honda

     arriving. Bill slows for a moment to let Ivy pass. Then

     continues on it's way back to Tulsa and the airport.

     Ivy pulls in next to Bev's big Lincoln. Climbs out.     Walks

     to her sister, looks back to the rental leaving.

                            IVY

                  Where are Bill and Jean going?

     Barbara doesn't answer, just stands there.

                            IVY (CONT'D)

                  Karen, too?

                            BARBARA

                  Yeah...

     Barb turns, heads for the house, Ivy follows --

                            IVY

                  Is she clean?

                            BARBARA

                  She's moderately clean.

                            IVY

                  I'm nervous.

                            BARBARA

                  Oh Christ, Ivy, not today.

                            IVY

                  I have to tell her, don't I? We're

                  leaving for New York tomorrow.

                            BARBARA

                  That's not a good idea. For you and

                  Charles to take this any further.

     Ivy runs from the house.

               I was trying to protect you --

               We'll go anyway, we'll still go away.

     Ivy gets in the car, starts it, revs the engine.    Barbara

     tries to open the car door.

                         BARBARA

               This is not my fault.

     Barbara pounds on the car window.

               I didn't tell you, Mom told you!

               There's no difference.

     Ivy floors the car, roars out of the driveway, leaving Barb

     standing there. After a moment, Barb turns, stares up at the

     house, angry, resolute. Starts back inside.

                  She'll be back. She's a sweet girl,

                  isn't strong. Not like you. Or me.

                  You knew about Daddy and Mattie Fae?

                  Oh sure. I never told them I knew.

                  But your father knew. He knew I knew.

                  But we never talked about it. I chose

                  the higher ground.

                      (and then)

                  If I'd had the chance, there at the

                  end, I would've told him, "I hope this

                  isn't about Little Charles, cause you

                  know I know all about that." If I'd

                  reached him at that motel, I would've

                  said, "You'd be better off if you quit

                  sulking about this ancient history."

                            BARBARA

                  I called over there on Monday after I

                  it was too late, he'd checked out.

                  He did this though, not us. Can you

                            VIOLET (CONT'D)

                  You and me. We're alike.

     Barb doesn't turn around, keeps moving.         Quietly:

                              "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   135.

91   CONTINUED:                                                     91

                              BARBARA

                  No...

     Sees Barb heading across the yard for Beverly's pick-up.

                            VIOLET

                  Barbara, please.

                            BARBARA

                  I'm nothing like you...

                            VIOLET

                  Please, Barbara.

     Watches Barbara climb into the truck, back slowly out, go.

                            VIOLET (CONT'D)

                  ...Barbara?

     Barbara drives off. The driveway now empty again. Violet

     alone outside on the walkway. She turns back to the house,

     yelling, moving from empty room to empty room.

                              VIOLET (CONT'D)

                  Ivy?!    Ivy, you here?!

     Silence.   The dining room, the kitchen.

                             VIOLET (CONT'D)

                  Barb?!   Ivy?!

     And into the living room, Bev's study.

                            VIOLET (CONT'D)

                  Bev?! ...Bev?!

     She stumbles to the stereo, puts on her Clapton... stares at

     the spinning album...

                              VIOLET (CONT'D)

                  Johnna?!

     She reels to the stairs, crawling up --

92   INT/EXT. BEVERLY'S PICK-UP (MOVING) - DAY                       92

     Barbara is nearly catatonic as she drives, the house receding

     in the rear window behind her.

     A few large rain drops splatter her windshield, the rumble of

     distant thunder, lightning and towering, ominous clouds in

     the distance.

                         "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft    136.

93   INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY/ATTIC STAIRS - DAY                      93

     Violet climbs the staircase on all fours.

                         VIOLET

               Johnna... Johnna... Johnna...

     Johnna sets down her TS Elliot, goes to Violet, holds

     Violet's head, smooths her hair, rocks her. Quietly --

                         VIOLET (CONT'D)

               And then you're gone, and Beverly,

               and then you're gone, and Barbara,

               and then you're gone, and then

               you're gone, and then you're gone --

     Johnna quietly sings to Violet.

                 JOHNNA                            VIOLET

     "This is the way the world        --and then you're gone, and

     ends..."                          then you're gone --

94   INT. BEVERLY'S PICK-UP - DAY                                  94

     ON Barbara as she drives --

                         JOHNNA (OS)

               "...this is the way the world ends,

               this is the way the world ends..."

                         VIOLET (OS)

               --and then you're gone, and then

               you're gone...

     We stay on Barb as she slowly pulls herself back together.

     Brushes tears from her cheeks. Laughs darkly. Notices her

     hands are shaking from the adrenaline.

     Slows, pulls the pick-up to the side of the road at the top

     of a small rise. Climbs out, stares out over the miles of

     prairie. The wind gently ruffles her clothing, her hair.

     CLOSE ON her as she settles into exhausted relief, unsure of

     what comes next, but finally on her way as we --

                                                  FADE TO BLACK
