WILD AT HEART

W I L D  A T  H E A R T

				     a love story

				     written by

				     David Lynch

				 based on the book by

				     Barry Gifford

And now the story of Sailor and Lula.....

1. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

A MAN rides a screaming massive Japanese motorcycle - wound out to 

maximum R.P.M. up the street.

								CUT TO:

2. SIGN BY ROADSIDE

The sign reads KIDS PLAYING - SPEED BUMPS.

								CUT TO:

3. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

With a whine from hell, the front tire of the motorcycle hits a speed 

bump.

The motorcycle becomes airborne and on the way up slices itself in half 

as it scrapes along the full length of a Datsun Kingcab.

In the air, the rider and motorcycle twist violently as they fly by.

The motorcycle bounces off a black 66 Chevrolet and makes a sound like 

the end of the world.

The rider hits the same Chevy a moment later.  Like a broken ragdoll 

shot from a canon, the man punches through the back window blowing glass 

for a block.  He stops somewhere under the front seat and a bubble of 

blood forms out his nose.

The motorcycle continues on sliding and spinning with an ear-piercing 

howl for one entire city block.

								CUT TO:

4. EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - VACANT LOT - DAY

Two rabid dogs fight ferociously in a vacant lot - ripping each others 

flesh.  An OLD COUPLE, both with walkers, inch painfully along nearby.

				OLD WOMAN

		Oh my God! ... Why they doin that?

				OLD MAN

		Who the hell knows.  What you have

		in your mouth?

The old woman begins to turn away, covering her mouth with her hand.

				OLD MAN 

		Spit it out!!! ... Pull your teeth

		out ... doctor said.  What you 

		tryin to do?  SPIT IT OUT!!!

The Old Man grabs the Old Woman by the neck and squeezes.  Out comes a 

tangled and sticky ball of hard fruit candies.

								CUT TO:

5. WASP NEST

A thousand wasps hover threateningly in the air around the nest.  A 

SMALL GROUP OF HARDENED CRIMINAL NINE-YEAR OLDS sporting hideous grins, 

bat the nest violently to and fro with sticks.  One kid busies himself 

shooting a large can of Black Flag garden spray into a crack in the 

nest.  Another stomps half-dead wasps up and down the sidewalk.  All the 

kids are making animal noises of one sort or the other.

								CUT TO:

6. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

The telephone rings.  MARIETTA PACE FORTUNE, a rich Southern woman 

around fifty, carries her Martini and Rossi sweet vermouth drink across 

the livingroom and answers the phone.

				MARIETTA

		Hello...  Who is this?...

								CUT TO:

7. INT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY

A GUARD stands by as SAILOR RIPLEY, twenty-three years old - lost 

somewhere between the cool long-gone generation and a used-car salesman 

- speaks on a prisoner phone in a green cement cubicle with one bench.

				SAILOR

			(into phone)

		...Sailor Ripley...  Can I talk 

		to Lula?

								CUT TO:

6A. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

				MARIETTA

		Theres no way in hell you can speak

		to her and...

								CUT TO:

7A. INT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY

				SAILOR

			(feeling a smile coming on)

		What?...

								CUT TO:

6B. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

				MARIETTA

		...Yes you heard me...  Dont ever 

		call back here again.

Marietta hangs up the phone as LULA PACE FORTUNE, Mariettas twenty-year 

old daughter, comes quickly down the stairs.

				LULA

		Mama???

				MARIETTA

		You know who it was and you know 

		you arent, and I mean ARE NOT 

		gonna see him EVER...  End of story.

				LULA

			(quietly)

		Like hell.

Marietta, her hand still on the telephone, grips the receiver so hard 

her knuckles turn white.

								CUT TO:

8. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - LULAS ROOM UPSTAIRS - DAY

Lula enters her room and cranks up her stereo.  Speed metal music jumps 

up to around one hundred twenty decibels.

								CUT TO:

9. INT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY

The guard escorts Sailor away from the telephone and back to his cell.  

The iron bars of the door slide across Sailors face and close with a 

bang.

								CUT TO:

10. EXT. THE MUSIC BAR - NIGHT

A beat-up, red 64 Ford Falcon station wagon filled with insane 

TEENAGERS on speed and PCP race out of control down the street past the 

club - leaning out the car in every direction.  They scream out to the 

desolate-looking passerby.

				TEENAGERS

		EAT SHIT MOTHERFUCKERS!!!!!!

The camera cranes up to the neon club sign and gets lost among the hot 

pink neon, the frantic moths and the intense electric buzz.

								CUT TO:

11. INT. THE MUSIC BAR - NIGHT

Lula and her friend, BEANY THORN, sit at a table drinking rum Coca-Colas 

while watching and listening to a white blues band called THE BLEACH 

BOYS.  The group segues smoothly from Elmore Jamess Dust my Broom 

into Robert Johnsons Me and the Devil and Beany lets out a snort.

				BEANY

		I can dig this music...  But not 

		that singer.

				LULA

		Why?...  Hes right in the groove.

				BEANY

		Hes so ugly.  Guys with beards and

		beer guts aint quite my type.

				LULA

		          (giggles)

		Seeins how youre about as thick as

		a used string of unwaxed dental floss,

		dont know how you can criticize.

				BEANY

		Yeah, well, if he says that all that

		flab turns into dick at midnight, 

		hes a liar.

Lula and Beany laugh and swallow some of their drinks.

				BEANY

		So, Sailors gettin out soon, and

		youre gonna see him?

Lula nods and crushes an ice cube with her back teeth and chews it.

				LULA

		Meetin him at the gate.  That phone

		call this afternoon was the signal.

		My deranged mamas hid the keys to

		my car.  But of course, I know 

		exactly where they are.

				BEANY

		I didnt hate me so much, Id feel

		better wishin you luck.

				LULA

		Cant all husbands be perfect, and

		your Elmo probly wouldnta ever 

		got that second one pregnant, you

		hadnt kicked his ass out.

				BEANY

		So youre gonna be needin the 

		blue-bird pretty soon?

				LULA

		Real soon ... Ill be makin the swap 

		tomorrow, and thanks again, Beany.

The Bleach Boys kick into some kind of Professor Longhair swamp mambo.

								CUT TO:

12. EXT. BAY ST. CLEMENT - DAY

Plumes of smoke from fires rise in the distance.

DISSOLVE TO:

13. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

An empty livingroom.  The smoke from the city fire appears during the 

course of the DISSOLVE to be in the livingroom - then it disappears.

An empty hallway.

An empty stairway.

13A. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - MARIETTAS BEDROOM - DAY

Feet (Lulas) was across carpet.

A closet door opens.

A hand (Lulas) reaches into the pocket of a coat in her mothers 

closet.  The hand comes out clutching car keys.

13B. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - STAIRWAY - DAY

Lula races down the stairs and through a door into the garage.

								CUT TO:

14. EXT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

The electronic garage door opens and Lula drives her 80 Black Camaro 

out and away.  The garage door closes automatically.

								CUT TO:

15. EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

Lula drives fast up a neighborhood street.  She turns a corner and 

disappears.

								CUT TO:

16. INT. BEANY THORNS GARAGE - DAY

Lula throws her car keys under the front seat and goes around to Beanys 

67 dark blue Thunderbird convertible - fishes around under the T-Birds 

front seat for the keys - finds them - jumps in and takes off.

DISSOLVE TO:

17. EXT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

Marietta leaves her Cadillac Seville in her driveway and enters the 

house.  We can hear her calling out for Lula in the distance.  The 

calling changes - it becomes angry.  The garage door opens and Marietta 

comes storming out.  She leaps in her Caddy and peels out.

								CUT TO:

18. INT. SOUTHERN TIME BAR - DAY

Marietta enters the bar on the run.  She calls out to the BARTENDER...

				MARIETTA

		Wheres Johnnie?  Hes not in his office.

				BARTENDER

		Havent seen im yet today, Marietta.

				MARIETTA

			(slightly hysterical)

		Well I gotta find him - right this

		minute!

								CUT TO:

19. EXT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY

Sailor is waiting out front as Lula pulls up in her T-Bird - throwing 

out a cloud of dust.  Theyre both smiling.

				LULA

		Hey baby...

				SAILOR

		Peanut...

They kiss tenderly and then Sailor walks around the car to get in while 

Lula opens up a suitcase and gets out his snakeskin jacket.

				SAILOR

		Hey, my snakeskin jacket...  Thanks,    

		baby...  Did I ever tell you that

		this here jacket for me is a symbol

		of my individuality and my belief

		in personal freedom?

				LULA

		Bout fifty thousand times.  I got 

		us a room at the Cape Fear, and 

		guess what?...  I hear Powermads 

		at The Hurricane.

				SAILOR

			(smiling)

		Stab it and steer.

Lula tromps it and throws out an even larger cloud of dust.

								CUT TO:

20. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

Sailor and Lula lay on the bed in the Cape Fear Hotel listening to the 

fan creak.

				LULA

		Did you ever think somethin like

		about the wicked witch of the east

		comin flyin in?...  Did you ever

		think somethin and then later think

		youve said it out loud to someone?

				SAILOR

		I really did miss your mind while I

		was out at Pee Dee, honey.  The

		rest of you, too, of course.  But 

		the way your head works is Gods own

		private mystery.  What was it you

		was thinkin?

				LULA

		Well, I was thinkin about smokin 

		actually...  My mama smokes Marlboros

		now, used to be she smoked Kools?

		I stole em from her beginnin in

		about sixth grade.  When I got old

		enough to buy my own, I bought those.

		Now Ive just about settled on Mores,

		as you probably noticed?  Theyre longer.

				SAILOR

		I guess I started smokin when I was

		about six...  My mama was already

		dead from lung cancer...

				LULA

		What brandd she smoke?

				SAILOR

		Camels, same as me...  Guess both

		my mama and my daddy died of smoke

		or alcohol related illness.

				LULA

		Gee, Sailor.  Im sorry, honey.  I 

		never would have guessed it.

				SAILOR

		Its okay.  I hardly used to see 

		them anyway.  I didnt have much 

		parental guiding.  The public defender

		kept sayin that at my parole hearin.

		He was a good ol boy, stood by me...

		Even brought me some cartons of 

		cigarettes from time to time.

				LULA

		Id stand by you, Sailor ... through

		anything.

				SAILOR

		Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after

		I planted Bob Ray Lemon.  A man cant

		ask for more than that.

Lula pulls Sailor over to her and kisses him soft on the mouth.

				LULA

		You move me, Sailor, you really do.

		You mark me the deepest.

Sailor pulls down the sheet, exposing Lulas breasts.

				SAILOR

		Youre perfect for me, too.

				LULA

		You remind me of my daddy, you know?

		Mama told me he liked skinny women

		whose breasts were just a bit too

		big for their bodies.  He had a long

		nose, too, like theirs.  Did I ever

		tell you how he died?

				SAILOR

		In a fire, as I recall.

				LULA

		Started he couldnt remember things?

		Got real violent?  Mama kept tellin

		me it was on account of lead poisoning

		from cleanin the old paint off our

		house without usin a mask...  But

		I dont know.  Seems like his brain

		just fell apart in pieces.

								CUT TO:

21. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

CLYDE FORTUNE tears a door off the kitchen cabinets and strews the 

cabinet contents all across the counter and floor.  He puts his fist 

through the kitchen window.  He leaps on the counter and bats the 

kitchen ceiling light - smashing it.  He kicks over the refrigerator.

				CLYDE

		FUCKIN BITCH!!!!

								CUT TO:

22. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

Lulas eyes look off, remembering.

				LULA

		Finally in the middle of the one 

		night, with me and mama asleep 

		upstairs ... he poured kerosene over

		himself and lit a match.

								CUT TO:

23. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - LIVINGROOM - NIGHT

Clyde Fortune, completely engulfed in fire, races across and back the 

livingroom until he collapses in a fifties modern armchair.  The drapes 

behind him burst in flames.

				LULA

			(voice-over)

		Near burned down the house.  We 

		got out just in time.

The whole livingroom goes up in flames.

								CUT TO:

24. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

CU the red hot ash of Lulas cigarette as she inhales deeply.  As she 

exhales a cloud of smoke she turns to Sailor.

				LULA

		It was a year before I met you.

Sailor takes the cigarette out of Lulas hand and puts it into the 

ashtray by her bed.  He pulls her to him and kisses her throat.

				SAILOR

		You have such a pretty, long neck, 

		like a swan.

				LULA

		Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth

		white neck.  It was like on a 

		statue it was so white?

Sailor drifts his thumb over Lulas left nipple then cups her breast in 

his hand.  They kiss.

								CUT TO:

25. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

Marietta pours JOHNNIE FARRAGUT another shot of scotch.

				MARIETTA

		I knew this would happen.  Soon as

		that piece of filth got out of 

		Pee Dee, I knew thered be trouble.

		Hes just got some kind of influence

		over her I cant decipher.  Theres 

		somethin wild in Lula I dont know

		where it comes from.  You gotta find

		em, Johnnie.

				JOHNNIE

		He served his time for what he did.

		Another thing...  If Lula went with

		him of her own volition - willingly,

		that is - there aint much can be

		done about it.

				MARIETTA

		Dont talk down to me, Johnnie 

		Farragut.  I know what volition means,

		and thats why I want Sailor Ripley

		off the planet!  Hes pure slime and 

		its leakin all over my baby.  

		Maybe you could push him into makin

		some kinda move and then kill him

		dead.  Youd only be defendin 

		yourself, and with his record, 

		nobodyd fuss.

Johnnie pours himself another tumblerful of Walker Black Label.

				JOHNNIE

		Ill locate Lula, Marietta, and if

		shes with the Ripley boy, Ill

		give him a talkin to and try to

		convince her to come back with me.

		Thats about all I can do.

He takes a long swallow from the tumbler.  Marietta begins to cry.  She 

blubbers for a few seconds, and then stops as abruptly as shed started.  

Her grey eyes glaze over.

				MARIETTA

		Ill hire a hit man if you dont want

		to help me stop this thing.  Ill

		call Marcello Santos.

				JOHNNIE

		Now, Marietta, I am goin to help you.

		And dont be gettin carried away.

		You dont want to be bringin Santos

		and his people into it.

				MARIETTA

		Youre just jealous of Santos cause

		hes sweet on me.

				JOHNNIE

		Darlin, you aint seein Santos 

		again, are ya?

				MARIETTA

		Oh, Johnnie Farragut...  Dont you 

		trust your very own Marietta?

				JOHNNIE

		Sorry, sweetheart.  Bein in love 

		with you like I am brings out that 

		ugly jealous side.

				MARIETTA

		Well stop worryin about me and 

		start worryin about how youre 

		gonna get that Lula back here and 

		away from that murderer.

				JOHNNIE

		Sailor aint a murderer.  You got to

		get off that kick.  And fars I can 

		tell, Sailor was entire clean prior

		to that involvin Lula.  Even there

		he was protectin her.  You oughta

		be thankin him for that.  That Bob

		Ray Lemon they say was comin after

		the both of em.  Why am I tellin

		you this, you was around that night.

		You ought to know just exactly what

		happened.  Sailor just got a little

		too forceful is all...  You remember

		that night...

CU of Marietta eyes as she thinks back.

								CUT TO:

26. INT. BAY ST. CLEMENT HOTEL - BALLROOM - NIGHT

We see Marietta standing in a carpeted hallway above the ballroom.  

Dance band music can be heard in the distance.  Sailor appears coming up 

the hallway - slightly drunk - he carefully sets his drink on the carpet 

outside the MENS ROOM.

Mariettas POV of Sailor entering the MENS ROOM.

CU of Mariettas glazed eyes and smiling face.

Mariettas POV of walking toward MENS ROOM.

								CUT TO:

27. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

				MARIETTA

		Maybe I was there, but I didnt see 

		anythin.  All I knows that trash

		killed a man with his bare hands.

		Hands which are now probly all

		over my baby!

				JOHNNIE

		Marietta, settle down now darlin...

		I want whats best for her, too -

		Like I said, Ill do what I can to

		bring her home.

								CUT TO:

28. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

Lula is standing in the bathroom of their room at the Hotel fooling with 

her hair in front of the mirror.  Sailor can see her through the doorway 

from where he lays on the bed.

				LULA

		Sailor, you are somethin else, 

		honey...  When I was fifteen, Mama

		told me that pretty soon Id be

		startin to think about sex, and

		I should talk to her before I did

		anything about it.

				SAILOR

		But honey, I thought you told me

		your Uncle Pooch raped you when

		you was thirteen.

				LULA

		Thats true.  Uncle Pooch wasnt

		really an uncle.  He was a business

		partner of my daddys?  And my mama

		never knew nothin about me and 

		him - thats for damn sure.  His real

		name was somethin kind of European,

		like Pucinski.  But everyone just

		called him Pooch.  He came around the

		house sometimes when Daddy was away.

		I always figured he was sweet on 

		mama, so when he cornered me one 

		afternoon, I was surprised moren

		a little.

				SAILOR

		Howd it happen, peanut?  He just

		pull out the old toad and let it

		croak?

Lula brushes away her bangs and frowns.  She takes a cigarette from the 

pack on the sink and lights it, then lets it dangle from her lips while 

she teases her hair.

				LULA

		Youre terrible crude sometimes, 

		Sailor, you know?

				SAILOR

		I cant hardly understand you when

		you talk with one of them Mores in

		your mouth.

Lula takes a long, slow drag on her More and sets it down on the edge of 

the sink.

				LULA

		I said you can be too crude sometimes?

		I dont think I care for it.

				SAILOR

		Sorry, sugar.  Go on and tell me how

		old Pooch done the deed.

				LULA

		Well, mama was at the Busy Bee havin

		her hair dyed?  And I was alone in 

		the house.

								CUT TO:

29. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

We see what she talks about.

				LULA

			(voice-over)

		Uncle Pooch came in the side door

		through the porch, you know?  Where

		I was makin a jelly and banana

		sandwich?  I remember I had my hair

		in curlers cause I was goin that

		night with Vicki and Cherry Ann, the

		DeSoto sisters.  Uncle Pooch must have

		known nobody but me was home, cause 

		he came right in and put both his

		hands on my butt and sorta shoved me

		up against the counter.

								CUT TO:

30. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

				SAILOR

		Didnt he say somethin?

Lula shakes her head.  She picks up her cigarette, takes a puff and 

throws it into the toilet.

ECU of cigarette in toilet.

				LULA

		Not really.  Least not so I recall now.

Lula flushes the toilet and watches the More come apart as it swirls 

down the hole.

ECU of cigarette coming apart as it swirls.

				SAILOR

		So howd he finally nail you?  Right 

		there in the kitchen?  

				LULA

		No, he picked me up.

								CUT TO:

31. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - KITCHEN/MAIDS ROOM - DAY

We see what she talks about.

				LULA

			(voice-over)

		He was short but powerful.  With 

		hairy arms?  Anyway, he carried me 

		into the maids dayroom which nobody

		used.  We did it there on an old bed.

								CUT TO:

32. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

				SAILOR

		We did it?  Whattaya mean?  Didnt

		he force you?

				LULA

		Well, sure.  But he was super-gentle,

		you know?  I mean, he raped me and

		all, but I guess theres all 

		different kinds of rapes.  I didnt

		exactly want him to do it but I 

		suppose once it started, it didnt

		seem all that terrible.  It was over 

		pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch

		just stood there and pulled up his

		trousers and left me there.  I 

		stayed in bed till I heard him drive

		off.  Then I just went back into

		the kitchen and finished makin my

		sandwich.

				SAILOR

		And you never told nobody about it?

				LULA

		Just you.  Uncle Pooch never acted

		strange or different after.  And he

		never did anything else to me.  I

		always got a nice present from him

		at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry?

			(pause)

								CUT TO:

33. TWO LANE HIGHWAY - DAY

One hundred twenty decibels - head on collision of a 54 Ford Pick-Up 

and a 64 Chevy Station Wagon.  No survivors.  Balls of flame and 

grinding metal.

								CUT TO:

34. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

				LULA

		Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three

		years later while he was holidayin

		in Myrtle Beach.  They still got way

		too much traffic there for my taste...

		And another thing, baby...  That

		government of ours should be keepin

		us separated from outer space...

				SAILOR

		Here she goes again...

				LULA

		Sailor, that ozone layer is

		disappearin.  Seems to me the 

		government could do somethin about

		it.  One of these mornings the

		sunll come up and burn a hole clean

		through the planet like an X-Ray.

Lula strikes a match and lights another cigarette.

				SAILOR

			(laughs)

		That aint never will happen, honey.

		Least not in our lifetime.

Somewhere in the hotel a woman laughs.  It is a kind of wild, crazy 

laugh, and for the few seconds it lasts, Lulas face goes pale.

				SAILOR

		You okay, honey?

				LULA

		That womans laugh creeps me out.

		I heard somethin like that...

		somewhere before...  Soundd like 

		the wicked witch...

				SAILOR

		Just sounded like an old gal havin

		a good time to me...  You ready to

		dance?

				LULA

		Im always ready to dance.  But I

		need me a kiss first, honey.  Just one?

Lula and Sailor kiss.  In the middle of the kiss, the womans 

creepy/crazy laugh is heard again in the distance and Lulas eyes snap 

open with a kind of fear.

								CUT TO:

35. EXT. FORTUNE HOUSE - BACKYARD - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Marietta is escorting MARCELLO SANTOS and two stiff drinks to a table in 

her backyard.

				SANTOS

		I knew youd want it again...

				MARIETTA

		Thats not why I called.

				SANTOS

		Oh yeah - sure ... okay.

				MARIETTA

		Santos...  It isnt.

				SANTOS

		Have it your way...  But you want it.

				MARIETTA

		Lulas gone off with Sailor.

				SANTOS

		What do you want me to do about it?

				MARIETTA

		I want you to take care of Sailor, so

		he wont ever be able to bother my

		baby again.

				SANTOS

		Take care of him?

				MARIETTA

		Yes.

				SANTOS

		What does take care of him mean?...

		Do you want me to give him food or

		some clothing?

				MARIETTA

		Whats with you?...  You know what

		take care of him means.  I dont 

		call Santos except for one big reason.

				SANTOS

		Big is the key word, and Im telling

		you I want it bad.

				MARIETTA

		I want you to get rid of Sailor.

				SANTOS

		Get rid of him?

				MARIETTA

		Yes...  Get rid of him.

				SANTOS

		How would I do that?  Send him on a

		trip - like maybe to Hawaii?

				MARIETTA

		Santos, why in hell do you insist on

		playin this stupid game?

				SANTOS

		Just tell me what you want.

				MARIETTA

		I dont need to explain anymoren I

		have...  You know damn well.

				SANTOS

		You need to explain it.

				MARIETTA

		All right...  I want you ... to ...

		kill ... Sailor...  As simple as that.

				SANTOS

		Simple?  Kill him?...  How?

				MARIETTA

		Thats your business...  I dont care

		how.

				SANTOS

		Like an accident where maybe Lula

		might also get hurt?

				MARIETTA

		NO...  For Gods sakes, Santos!

				SANTOS

		Well, like kill him with the atomic

		bomb?

				MARIETTA

		Santos...

				SANTOS

		Explain it...  I told you.

				MARIETTA

		Shoot him.

				SANTOS

		Shoot him?  Like with a gun?

				MARIETTA

		Yes.

				SANTOS

		Where?...  In the leg?

				MARIETTA

		No.

				SANTOS

		Where?

				MARIETTA

		In the head.

				SANTOS

		Shoot Sailor in the head with a 

		gun...  Now Im beginning to get 

		it...  You want me to shoot Sailor

		in the head with a gun.

				MARIETTA

		Yes.

				SANTOS

		But where in the head?...  Not the

		chin, I hope.

				MARIETTA

		No...  In the brains...  What little

		Im sure he has.

				SANTOS

		You want me to shoot Sailor in the

		brains with a gun.  

				MARIETTA

		Yes.

				SANTOS

		Through the forehead?

				MARIETTA

		Yes.

				SANTOS

		Wrong!  Its much better to blow a

		hole in the back of the head ... 

		right toward the bridge of the nose

		...  Lots and lots of irreparable

		damage.

				MARIETTA

		See!  I knew you had it all under 

		control.

				SANTOS

		Why didnt you send Johnnie Farragut?

				MARIETTA

		Maybe I did...  Try New Orleans first...

		Lula cant ever stop talkin bout that

		town.

				SANTOS

		On one condition...

He pauses and smiles strangely.

				SANTOS

		You give me your permission to kill

		Johnnie Farragut.

				MARIETTA

			(whisper)

		Santos...  No...  Please, Santos...

				SANTOS

		Youre not tellin me that youre 

		sweet on him?

				MARIETTA

		No...  But...

				SANTOS

		One day hes gonna find out what 

		were up to with Mr. Reindeer, and

		he could cause us a lot of trouble.

They stare at each other for a moment.

				SANTOS

		Im gonna take your silence as a 

		yes...

				MARIETTA

		Santos...  I cant...

				SANTOS

		Shhhh...  Its all right...  Also, I

		either take you or that pretty 

		daughter of yours to bed.

				MARIETTA

		You fucker, dont you ever touch 

		Lula -  You fucker, Ill kill you.

36. INT. THE HURRICANE - A SPEED METAL CLUB - NIGHT

We see the sign which has all the letters tipped way over to the right - 

as if in a hurricane.  Two leaning palm trees border the sign.

One hundred decibels of speed metal.  We see the name Powermad on the 

bass drum.

The BAND segues into Slaughter House and its a hot one.  Sailor grabs 

Lula and they start dancing like two jacked-up spastics in an electrical 

storm.  a few PUNKS actually stop dancing to watch Sailor and Lula.  

They thought theyd seen everything.

CU of Lula and Sailor - theyre in love and dancing hot.  An IDIOT PUNK 

moves close to Lula and rubs up against her as he dances by.  Sailor 

turns to the lead guitar player and signals him to stop the music 

immediately.  Suddenly everything is deathly quiet.  Sailor gives the 

man a fully extended Reno point...

				SAILOR

		Are you going to provide me with an 

		opportunity to prove my love to my

		girl?  Or are you gonna save 

		youself some trouble and step up 

		like a gentleman and apologize to her?

				IDIOT PUNK

		Dont fuck with me, man.  You look 

		like a clown in that stupid jacket.

				SAILOR

		This is a snakeskin jacket, and for

		me its a symbol of my individuality

		and my belief in personal freedom.

				IDIOT PUNK

		...Asshole.

				SAILOR

		(as he moves toward the Idiot Punk)

		Come here.

				LULA

		Sailor, honey...

The Idiot Punk tries to hit Sailor, but Sailor slaps him so hard his 

knees almost bend backwards.  The Idiot Punk goes down - fighting back 

tears and holding his cheek.

				SAILOR

		     (helping him up)

		Im sorry to do this to ya here 

		in front of a crowd, but I want ya

		to stand up and make a nice apology

		to my girl.

				IDIOT PUNK

			(to Lula)

		Im sorry.

				LULA

		Hell, you just rubbed up against 

		the wrong girl is all.

				SAILOR

		Thats good...  Now go get yourself

Sailor starts to sing an Elvis Presley song, Love Me.  As the band 

joins in with a perfect back-up - Sailor sings to Lula.  The Speed Metal 

crowd is mesmerized.

Sailor laughs.

				SAILOR

		Yeah, well listen to this...  Radio

		doctor figured out that if, say, a

		fella got his nose cut off or bit

		off in, say, a barfight or somethin,

		theyd sew one of his forearms to his

Sailor and Lula pass a sign that reads NEW ORLEANS - 26 MILES.  Sailor 

pulls off the road into a Gulf gas station mini-mart and stops the car 

next to a self-serve pump.  A sign on the top of it says PLEASE PAY

74. INT. MINI-MART - DAY

A tall OLD BLACK MAN about seventy years old, wearing a torn green 

Tulane tee-shirt and a dirty orange Saints baseball cap, is filing items 

on the counter by the cash register.  In the pile are four ready-made, 

plastic-wrapped sandwiches, two tuna salad and two cotto salami; six 

Twinkies; a package of Chips Ahoy chocolate chip cookies; four Slice 

colas; two Barqs root beers; and a large package of fried pork rinds, 

extra salted.

				BLACK MAN

		    (to Sailor and another guy 

		    also waiting to pay for gas)

		Sorry, gentlemen.  Im most finished

		on my shoppin here.

				ERV

		This be it?

				BLACK MAN

		Yall take American Express?

				ERV

		Yessir.

				BLACK MAN

		Then lemme throw in a couple more

		things.

Sailor and the man in line behind him watch as the black man gathers up 

several more packages of Twinkies along with a few cupcakes and half a 

dozen cans of Pretty Kitty cat food, three liver and three chicken 

dinner portions, and tosses them on his pile.

				BLACK MAN

		   (to Sailor, smiling - showing 

		    no visible upper teeth)

		Pussycats gotta eat, too.

He hands an American Express card to the clerk, ERV, who runs it through 

the verifier.  The card checks out okay and the old guy prepares a 

charge slip, has the man sign it, and bags the purchases.

				BLACK MAN

			(to Erv)

		Id just soon have a paper bag 

		rather than a plastic one, if its

		same to you.

				ERV

		  (shoving the plastic bag he

		   filled towards the black man)

		We dont have no paper bags.

A telephone begins to ring and everyone looks around.  The Black Man 

reaches in his jacket pocket and pulls out a portable phone and punches 

send.

				BLACK MAN

			(into phone)

		Hello...  Yeah, mama, Im on my 

		way...

			(to Sailor and other guy

		   as he picks up his bag

			and heads out)

		Thanks for waitin, gentlemen.

Everyone is silent as they watch the old Black Man hobble out.

				SAILOR

			(to Erv)

		All I wants ten bucks regular.

		Oh yeah, and a Mounds bar.

Erv takes one off the candy and gum rack next to the register and lays 

it on the counter.  Sailor gives him a twenty dollar bill.

				SAILOR

		I aint got my American Express card

		with me, so I gotta use cash.  Hope

		thats okay.

Sailor smiles, but the clerk keeps a poker face and just gives him his 

change.  The guy in line behind Sailor shakes his head and grins.

75. EXT. MINI MART/THUNDERBIRD - DAY

Sailor goes back to the car.

				LULA

		That took long enough.  You forget

Sailor tosses her the candy bar.

man, DROP SHADOW approach with their trays of food.

				REGGIE

		Do you mind if we share this table?

		...  The others, they are occupied.

Johnnie looks around - sees that there are quite a few empty tables - he 

looks the men over quickly.

				JOHNNIE

			(cautiously)

		Alright...  By all means.  Make

				DROP SHADOW

			(as he sits down)

		Muchas gracias.

				REGGIE

		My name is Reginald San Pedro Sula.

		But please do call me Reggie.  This

		is my friend, who we call Drop

		Shadow.  He is always with me.

Johnnie wipes off his right hand on his napkin and shakes.

				JOHNNIE

		Johnnie Farragut.  Pleased to meet ya.

Reggie and Drop Shadow begin eating ferociously, finishing half of their 

meal before saying anything more.

				REGGIE

		You are from New Orleans, Senor 

		Farragut?

				JOHNNIE

		Johnnie, please.  Nope.  Charlotte,

		North Carolina.  Here on business.

Reggie smiles broadly, revealing numerous tall, gold teeth.

				DROP SHADOW

		Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.

				REGGIE

		Do you know Honduras, Johnny?

				JOHNNIE

		Only that its supposed to be a 

		pretty poor sight since the hurricane

		came through last year.

				REGGIE

		Yes, thats so.  But there is not 

		much to destroy.

				DROP SHADOW

		No big buildings like in New Orleans.

				JOHNNIE

		Whattaya do there?

				REGGIE

			(laughs)

		Oh, many things...

				DROP SHADOW

		Mr. San Pedro Sulas got an appliance

		shop.

				REGGIE

		But I am also with the government.

Johnnie takes a bite of his oyster sandwich.

				JOHNNIE

		In what capacity?

				REGGIE

		In many capacities.

				DROP SHADOW

		Mr. San Pedro Sula is with the 

		Secret Service.

Reggie reaches into his back pocket and takes out his wallet.  He hands 

a card to Johnnie.

				JOHNNIE

			(reading aloud)

		General Osvaldo Tamarindo y Ramirez.

		Telefono 666.

				REGGIE

		He is my sponsor.  The General is

		the head of the secret police of

		Honduras.

				DROP SHADOW

		Mr. San Pedro Sula is one of his

		operatives.

Johnnie hands the card back to Reggie and Reggie gives him a small piece 

of paper, folded once.  Johnnie unfolds it.  The printing is in Spanish.

				REGGIE

		That is my permiso.

				DROP SHADOW

		Mr. San Pedro Sulas permit to kill.

				REGGIE

		Only if necessary, of course, and

		only in my own country.

			(laughs)

				JOHNNIE

		Of course.

Johnnie refolds the piece of paper and hands it over to Reggie.

				DROP SHADOW

		Mr. San Pedro Sulas authorized to

		carry a .45.

				REGGIE

		United States Marine issue, before

		they made the unfortunate switch to

		the less dependable nine millimeters.

		I have it here, in my briefcase.

Reggie holds up his stainless steel briefcase and then replaces it on 

the floor beneath his chair.

				JOHNNIE

		Why are you in New Orleans?  If you 

		dont mind my askin.

				REGGIE

		Certainly not.  We are here only

		briefly, in fact, until this evening,

		when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit

		a friend of mine who is an agent for

		the CIA.

				DROP SHADOW

		He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula

		and me bass fishing.

				REGGIE

		We are in the same businesses and

		also we are fishermen.

Johnnie swallows the last of his beer and stands up to leave.

				JOHNNIE

			(extending his hand)

		Its been a real pleasure.  I wish

		you both buena suerte wherever you go.

Reggie and Drop Shadow stand up.  They shake Johnnies hand.

				REGGIE

		The same to you.  If you are in 

		Honduras, come to the Bay Islands and

		visit us.  The Hondurans are great

		friends of the American people.  But

		I have a joke for you before I go.

		If a liberal, a socialist, and a 

		communist all jumped off the roof of

		the Empire State Building at the

				LULA

		Why were you killin pigeons, Mr.

		Kovich?  Were you in the extermination

				GEORGE

		No, maam.  I was a housepainter,

		retired now, livin with my sister, 

		Ida.  Ida moved down here twenty-five

		years ago, married an oil man named

		Smoltz, Ed Smoltz.  Hes dead now,

Roach pulls a piece of raw cows liver out of one of his pockets of his 

field jacket and begins ripping little bits off it and feeding them to 

the dogs.

				LULA

		  (screeches as she sees this)

		Sailor!  Stop!  Stop the car now!

Sailor pulls off the road onto the shoulder of the highway and stops.  

Lula opens her door and jumps out.

				LULA

		Im sorry, but I cant take this.  

		Roach, or whatever your name is, you

		come out of there with them dogs

		this instant!

Roach sticks the liver back in his pocket and pulls his pack and the box 

of tiny canines after him.  Once he and his belongings are deposited on 

the roadside, Lula hops back in the car and slams the door.

				LULA

		Im truly sorry?  Im truly sorry, 

		Roach.  But aint gonna make it to

		Alaska?  Least not any part of the 

		way with us.  Youd best find a

		proper, before they all die?  And,

Lula takes a pair of sunglasses off the dashboard and puts them on.

				LULA

		Drive.

Sailor takes off.

				SAILOR

		You dont feel you was a little hard

		on the guy, honey?

				LULA

		I know youre thinkin that I got

coldly and waits.  Drop Shadow adjusts his socks.

Johnnie goes over to Reggie and Drop Shadow and shakes hands.

		We were.  Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and

				REGGIE

		Would you like to enjoy a martini

				JOHNNIE

		Why not?  How was the fishin?

				REGGIE

		I think they are too serious, these

Reggie orders martinis for the three of them.

		So, its back to the islands.

				DROP SHADOW

		Yes.  Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke

		But how are you finding New Orleans,

		Call me Johnnie...  N.O. has always

				REGGIE

		I can tell you are an intelligent

Reggie raises his glass to Johnnies.

COUPLES are swaying on the dance floor.  There are a dozen tables and a 

long bar in the room which is done up in a strange dark azquatic motif.  

Eight of the tables are occupied and SIX OR SEVEN MEN stand at the bar.  

Everyone in the place is black except for one WHITE WOMAN who is sitting 

alone at a table smoking a cigarette and drinking Pearl straight from 

the bottle.  The atmosphere is not friendly, but Lula takes Sailor by 

the arm.

				LULA

		Come on.

They step up to the bar and order two Lone Star beers.  The BARTENDER, a 

tall, heavyset man slowly forms his hand into the bird.  He holds his 

hand that way while he speaks...

BARTENDER ZANZIBAR

		This is a friendly place, son.  You 

		folks just relax and have a nice time.

				LULA

		   (bound and determined not 

		    to be intimidated)

		You got yourself a deal.

		Thats a real jacket...  By that,

				SAILOR

		This is a snakeskin jacket, and for

		Fuckin honky cracker mumbo jumbo.

The bartender moves on down the bar.  Lula and Sailor take a small table 

near the door.

				LULA

		Honey, we bein strangers here and

				LULA

		You think shes pretty?

Sailor looks at the woman.  She lights a new cigarette off a butt, then 

squashes the butt in the ashtray.  She is thirty years old, maybe more.  

Shoulder-length, bleached blonde hair, black at the roots.  Clear skin, 

green eyes.  Long, straight nose with a small bump on it.  She is 

wearing a low-cut lavender dress that would have emphasized her breasts 

had she not been so flat-chested.  Slender.

				SAILOR

		I tend to like em with a little

Lula gets quiet and sucks on her beer bottle.

116A. MAISON VIOLETTE - JOHNNIES ROOM - NIGHT

Johnnie smiles and heads up to his room.  He opens the door and steps 

inside.  WHAM!!  Johnnie is knocked in the head with a heavy metal pipe 

and he goes down hard.  A large dark figure grabs on to him and pulls 

him to an open window and lowers him into the back of a pick-up.  The

dark figure follows out the window.

DISSOLVE TO:

117. INT. MAISON VIOLETTE - LOBBY - NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT

Marietta is sitting in the lobby trying to hold herself together - half-

sobbing.  The MANAGER approaches and sits next to her.

				MANAGER

		Im afraid his car is gone, Mrs.

		Fortune.

				MARIETTA

		I dont understand this...  I dont

		understand this one bit.  He was 

		supposed to meet me right her in 

		this lobby.  Somethin bad has 

		happened - I jus know it.

				MANAGER

		Perhaps we should call a local law

		enforcement officer.

				MARIETTA

		HELL NO!!!  Thats the last thing 

		we need...  A buncha cops runnin

		around.

The front desk clerk steps from behind his desk and hurries into the 

lobby.

				DESK CLERK

		Im sorry...  But I have overlooked

		this.  Im truly sorry, maam.

He hands Marietta a note inside an envelope which she opens and reads 

immediately.  We see the note.  

NOTE

Gone fishing with a friend - maybe

buffalo hunting.  Johnnie.

				MARIETTA

		Oh God!  What does that mean?

				MANAGER

		Im sure I wouldnt know, maam ...

		and buffalo hunting too ... hmmmmm?

				MARIETTA

		And jus when my babys out on some

		Texas road with a killer.

The front door of the hotel opens and in walks Santos.  He seems to know 

exactly where Marietta is and steps to the door of the sitting room off 

the lobby.  He stands in the doorway and smiles at Marietta.

				MARIETTA

			(horrified whisper)

		Santos...  Wheres J-J-Johnnie?

				SANTOS

		Shhhhhh...

			(to the manager and desk clerk)

		Thank you, gentlemen...  Ill look

		after her now...

The Manager and Desk Clerk bow to Marietta and Santos and go back 

through the lobby.  Santos walks over to Marietta.  Marietta stands.

				MARIETTA

		Santos...  Whats happenin here?

				SANTOS

		Hey...  Stop the nervous cry-baby

		routine...  Youre my girl now...

		Santos is gonna wipe away those tears

		and make you happy...  Come on, lets

				MARIETTA

		Where we goin?

				SANTOS

Light comes from one small dirty window.

								CUT TO:

119. INT. SMALL HUT - DESERTED BAYOU - NIGHT

Johnnie is tied to a small wooden straight-backed chair.  His mouth is 

gagged and taped shut.  His hair is caked with dry blood and one fresh 

tickle curls down his forehead to his eyes which are just now beginning 

to open and focus.  Juana is finishing tying his left ankle to the chair 

leg.  Johnnie moans and Juana brings her big, smiling face up in front 

of his.

				JUANA

		Johnnie, you take a good look at me,

		baby, cause you gonna hafta watch

		close to know when we do it to ya...

		Yall count when I touch the bottle -

		pay attention fucka - otherwise we 

		hafta work it all night...  Too 

		much fun for us - you see what I 

		mean?  Now watch me how I touch a

		bottle and you count how many times.

Juana steps two paces across the hut where two dirty old soda bottles 

sit - one in one corner perched on a dried tree trunk - the other in the 

opposite corner perched on an old fence post.  Juana touches the left 

bottle (#1) once, and crosses and touches the right bottle (#2) once and 

comes back and touches Johnnies face.

				JUANA

		You see, Johnnie.  I toucha number

		one bottle once, I toucha number two

		bottle once, and I touch your face.

		This is a game we love to play.  I

		get hot already...  Now you meet

Reggie and Drop Shadow step out of the darkness behind Johnnie and come 

around to face him.

				REGGIE

		Hey, Johnnie...  Reggie - you remember

		Reggie, dont ya?  Look what I caught.

			(to Juana)

		Im gettin hot too, mama.

Reggie and Juana kiss hot in front of Johnnie.  Juana puts her face down 

in front of Johnnies again.

Reggie reaches his hand around in front of Johnnie - showing him a .45 

Automatic.

				DROP SHADOW

		Thats a Marine issue.  It goes off

		somethin terrible - you wanna see?

Drop Shadow pulls the hammer back which makes a loud click.

				JUANA

		You hear click?

Johnnie jumps as Drop Shadow blows a big hole in the far wall in front 

of Johnnie.

				REGGIE

			(laughs)

		Hell, its even worse than I 

		remember...  Wait a minute...

Reggie comes out in front of Johnnie - Juana grabs him.  They kiss hot 

again.

				JUANA

		Okay, gimmee nother kiss, Reggie

		bfore I fuck ya right now...

		FUCKIN HOT NOW, REGGIE.

		     her tongue sticking out)

Juana screams like a monster from hell coming up close to Johnnies 

face.

				JUANA

Reggie reaches his hand around Johnnies face - tears off tape and gag - 

then opens his hand and shows Johnnie a cufflink with a particular 

design in turquoise, orange, and silver.

				REGGIE

		I forgot to show you this.  The

		gentlemen that gave this to me said

		youd recognize it.  Said he wanted 

		itd be bout the last thing you ever

				JOHNNIE

				JUANA

		I GO ROUND AND ROUND - DO I TOUCH A

		SECOND BOTTLE BFORE I TOUCH JOHNNIE

		    (very quietly and breathy)

		No...  I touch Johnnie.

As her finger touches Johnnies face there is a loud CLICK.  Johnnie 

moans and closes his eyes.

				JUANA

			(counting fast)

		One ... two ... three ... four ...

		five ... GETTIN TOO FUCKIN HOT, 

		REGGIE...  FEELIN MYSEF ... six

Johnnie starts to scream and violently try to move out of his chair.

				JUANA

		Nine...

		FUCK ME NOW, REGGIE...  TEN!!!

We see a hole in the front of the barrel - BOOM!!!

The opposite wall and bottles get covered with blood.  Juana and Reggie 

race into each others arms and kiss right above Johnnies dead, 

bloodied head.

				LULA

				SAILOR

121. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - LIVINGROOM/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY/BEDROOM - NIGHT

The livingroom is on fire.

The livingroom is on fire and we move upstairs - Lula races through the 

smoke-filled hallway to her mothers bedroom.

The livingroom is on fire and Lula throws open the door to her mothers 

bedroom just in time to see Marcello Santos leaving through a window.  

Her mother laughs a wild, crazy laugh - exactly the same laugh Lula 

heard on the porch of the Cape Fear Hotel.

				LULA

			(voice-over)

		That night in the fire while my 

		daddy was dyin...  I saw mama up 

		in her room with Santos...

				LULA

			(quietly)

		My mama...

		  (after a pause - she smiles)

		So Sailor, our histories have been

		somewhat intertwined.

				SAILOR

		They have, sugar.

				LULA

		I take that as a sign that we were

		destined by fate to be together.

				SAILOR

		Its a comfortin idea.

				LULA

		Well, were really out in the middle

		of it now, aint we?

				SAILOR

		Theres worse places, honey.

				LULA

		If you say so.

				SAILOR

		Trust me on it.

				LULA

			(turns to him)

		I do trust you, Sailor.  Like I 

		aint never trusted nobody before.

				SAILOR

			(after a moment)

		Well be alright, peanut, long as 

		weve got room to move.

				LULA

		   (looking into the highway)

		Whats that?

				SAILOR

		I dont know...  Looks like clothes.

Sailor starts to slow down.  The highway is suddenly littered with 

clothes strewn everywhere and two open suitcases smashed near the side 

of the road.  Sailor slows down to a crawl.  He and Lula turn to each 

other - theyve just seen TWO DEAD BODIES.  One close to the side of the 

highway - and other just off in the desert brush.  Off behind is an 

overturned car.

				LULA

		Oh God, Sailor.

				SAILOR

		One bad car accident...

				LULA

		SAILOR!!!

Coming out of the darkness is a YOUNG GIRL, her clothes half torn off - 

blood draining out of several deep wounds.

				LULA

		Sailor, what are we gonna do?

				SAILOR

		I dont know, honey, but we gotta 

		help that girl - get her to a town and

		hope no one catches on I broke parole.

They get out of the car and the girl comes toward them screaming.

				GIRL

			(completely gone in shock)

		Ive got about five hundred dollars 

		in my wallet and I cant find it...

		My mothers going to kill me.  Its 

		got all my cards in it...  It was 

		in my pocket...  Now my pockets gone.

		MY PURSE IS GONE!!!  NOW SHE TELLS ME.

The girl starts walking back toward the car.

				SAILOR

		Lets get ahold a her quick.

				LULA

		You think shes gonna make it?

				SAILOR

		Dont know, but shes gonna bleed

		all over our car, Ill tell ya that...

		           (to Girl)

		Hey...  Hello...  Girl...  You gotta

		come with us, honey.

Sailor reaches out cautiously and takes hold of the girls arm.

				GIRL

		OWWW GOD!!!  LEAVE ME ALONE...

		ROBERT!!!...  Shit, I got this damn

		sticky stuff in my hair...

She keeps digging her fingers into a bloody wound in her head.

				GIRL

		Gotta find my wallet.

			(to Sailor)

		Dont you say one word of this to

		my mother.  God, shes gonna kill me.

The girls falls to one knee and struggles to get back up.  Sailor and 

Lula each take an arm and try to help her.

				GIRL

		WHERES MY HAIRBRUSH?...

Sailor and Lula help the girl stand, but her eyes start rolling back and 

a bunch of fresh blood comes gushing up out of her mouth.

				LULA

		I cant take this, Sailor.  Shes

		dyin right in front of our eyes...

				SAILOR

		Im afraid she is, baby.

Sailor kneels down next to the girl and runs his hand gently across her 

forehead.

				GIRL

			(wide-eyed now)

		Get my lipstick...

			(whisper)

		Its in my purse.

The girl dies.  Sailor and Lula hold real still for a moment.  Lula 

starts to cry.

				LULA

		She died right in front of me.  Whyd

		she have to go and do that, Sailor?

				SAILOR

		Lets get outta here, honey.

Before getting up, Sailor lets his hand come off the girls forehead 

down over her eyes - closing them.  He puts his hand on her cheek then 

gets up.  He puts his arm around Lula and they go back to her car.  

Sailor helps Lula in on her side and closes the door for her.  He goes 

around, gets in and looks over at Lula, who breaks down crying harder.  

Sailor starts the car and takes off.

123. INT. THUNDERBIRD - BIG TUNA - MORNING

The Thunderbird drives past a large stucco fish on a rock stand which 

has a sign on it that says BIG TUNA, TEXAS.  Sailor cruises the T-Bird 

along the main street of Big Tuna, eye-balling the place.

				SAILOR

		Well, it aint exactly Emerald City...

They stare at each other.  Lula suddenly feels sick to her stomach and 

slumps down on the edge of the bed.

				LULA

		heat makes me tired.

A tall, skinny man, RED, in his early thirties with wild, uncombed hair 

the color of pomegranate, walks out of the garage.

				SAILOR

				RED

			(with a smile)

		Well, I aint Blackie.

Sailor holds out his right hand to shake.

				SAILOR

		Names Sailor Ripley.  Katy over at

		some work I could do.

Red extends his oil-blackened right hand and shakes.

				RED

		Things aint real hot right now.

		Rex, there though,

				SAILOR

		I aint no Enzo Ferrari, but they

		Well see how she goes then when

Two men, SPARKY and BUDDY, both about forty, walk up to Red.  One of 

them wears a grey baseball cap with a Confederate flag on it and the 

other has an LBJ straw Stetson.

				SPARKY

		Shit, thats what I was afraid of.

				RED

		Ill get you foreigners a beer.

		Im Buddy, and this heres Sparky.

Sailor introduces himself to Sparky and Buddy and Rex.  They all shake 

hands or nod and move out of the sun to drink their beers.

				SAILOR

		My girl and I are lookin for a 

		place to settle.  Were bunked down

		at the Iguana Motel.

				SPARKY

		So are we.  Its the only motel in

just waking up on the bed.

				LULA

		That you, Sail, honey?

				SAILOR

Lula opens her eyes and looks at him.

				LULA

		You find any work?

Sailor, Lula, Sparky, and Buddy are sitting in the courtyard of the 

motel sharing Sparkys fifth of Ezra Brooks.  An electric bug killer is 

working overtime.  Buddy is reading from a newspaper.

				BUDDY

		     (reading from paper)

		Robert Brenton, twenty-five, was 

		killed when his car went off the road

Sailor looks at Lula.

The assistant manager, TOMMY THOMPSON, speaks from the shadows behind 

the group.

				TOMMY

		Robert Brenton, that dumb fuck.  That

They all look over at Tommy.

				BUDDY

		Hey, Tommy...  Whats goin on over

BOBBY PERU walks in and comes over.

				BOBBY

		Hey, everybody.

				BUDDY

		Sailor, Lula, this heres the man 

		himself.  Bobby, this is Sailor

		and Lula, the most recent strandees,

Bobby nods to Lula and offers a hand to Sailor.

				BOBBY

		Bobby Peru, just like the country.

Sparky and Buddy laugh.

				BUDDY

		Accordin to Red and Rex, Bobbys

		the most excitin item to hit Big

		Tuna since the 86 cyclone sheared

		the roof off the high school.

				SPARKY

		Only in town two months and there 

		aint a young thing around dont 

		know how that cobra tattoo works, 

		right, Bob?

Bobby laughs.  He has a lopsided grin that exposes only three brownish 

front teeth and he has flat black eyes that seem to reflect no light.

				LULA

		You from Texas, Mr. Peru?

Bobby pulls up a chair and pours himself a shotglass full of whiskey.

				BOBBY

		Im from all over.

				SAILOR

		    (noticing a USMC tattoo

		     on Bobbys right hand)

		You was in the Marines, huh?

Bobby looks down at his hand, flexs it.

				BOBBY

		Four years.

				SPARKY

		Bobby was at Cao Ben.

				LULA

		Whats Cao Ben?

				BOBBY

			(to Lula)

		How old are you?

				LULA

		Twenty.

				BUDDY

		Lotta women and kids and old people

		died at Cao Ben.

				BOBBY

		March, 1968.  We torched a village

		and the government made a big deal

		out of it.

Bobby sips the whiskey and closes his eyes for several seconds before 

reopening them and looking at Buddy.  His eyes open slowly and they 

practically burn a hole in Buddy.

				BOBBY

			(to Buddy)

		You was on a ship, pardner.  Hard to

		make contact with the people when

		youre off floatin in the Gulf of

		Tonkin.

				SPARKY

		Hey Bobby, have yourself another

Sparky refills Bobbys shotglass.  Bobby tosses it back in one gulp.

				BOBBY

		Dont mind if I fuckin do...  

		Speakin a Jack...  One-eyed Jacks

		yearnin to go a peepin in a

		seafood store...  Good meetin you.

He walks out and after hes gone...

Lula hands Sailor a note which reads Im pregnant.  Sailor looks into 

her eyes.

		Well, nothin personal, but I aint

Sailor crumples the note and puts it in the ashtray.

		I know.  Just Im sorta uncomfortable

				SAILOR

		What could I be up to, Lula?

		Hey Sailor...  Wait a minute...  I

As Bob Ray passes Lula on the stairs - he puts his hand between her 

legs.  Sailor starts to see red.  Bob Ray smiles and steps down to 

Sailor.  He leans in and whispers in Sailors ear.

Bob Ray pulls a knife, but Sailors fist is already halfway through Bob 

Rays brain.  From there, Sailor steps firmly into the crazy zone.  

Amidst blood-curdling hysterical screams from a growing throng of 

SOUTHERN BELLES, Sailor starts taking Bob Ray apart limb by limb and 

doesnt stop until Bob Ray lays completely destroyed and completely dead 

at the foot of the stairs.  The crowd of formally dressed onlookers

Bobby jumps back, then grabs Perditas hair and pulls her over the couch 

onto the floor.  Neither of them speak.  She tries to stand, but Bobby 

keeps his right foot on her chest while he blows the back of his wounded

Lula lays very still on the bed.  Her head is close to the small 

turquoise radio on the bedside table.  She is listening to a piece of 

sad, nostalgic music and as we move in closer to her and the radio - the 

volume increases.

Lula remembers some moments in her life with Sailor: (Music continues 

over)

When he kissed her outside the jail gate.

When he touched her breast the day after he got out of jail.

When they sat behind the Confederate Soldier.

When they danced to Slaughter House.

Suddenly, Lula sees an image in her mind that she does not recognize.  

She sees an abstract image of reflected light with two eyes looking

Sailor turns his pistol on Bobby now.  Bobby spins his shotgun around 

and points it at Sailor.

		Youre next, fucker.

The second old man is reaching under the counter.

Sailor fires his .32 at Bobby.  There are no live bullets in his pistol.  

It just makes a dry click.  Bobby smiles and is just about to kill 

Sailor when out of the corner of his eye he catches sight of the second 

old man bringing out a big shotgun of his own.  Bobby instinctively 

spins and empties the second barrel of his two-barrel shotgun into the 

old gentleman.  As Bobby is reloading fast, Sailor sprints through the 

front door.  Bobby is right behind him as he flys out the front door.

148A. EXT. RAMOS FEED STORE - DAY

The deputy recovers and comes up on one knee with his revolver clasped 

in both hands.  He fires his first shot into Bobbys thigh and his 

second into Bobbys left hip.  The shock of the initial slug causes 

Bobby to drop the bag.  The impact of the second forces Bobbys right 

hand to twist sideways to that both barrels of the shotgun wedge under 

his chin.  The Ithaca goes off, blowing Bobby backwards through the 

RAMOS on the plate glass window of the feed store.

Sailor hits the ground - losing the Smith as he falls.  He puts his hand 

over his hosieried head and keeps his face in the dirt until the deputy 

orders him to stand up.

Santos arms begin to go around Lula.  Lula lets out a blood-curdling

bear hug.  On one shirt cuff we see a cufflink which is turquoise, 

orange, and silver.

			(voice-over)

Dearest Sailor Darling,

The first thing youll want to know is Im keeping the baby.

Mama wasnt for it in the beginning but I think shes looking

forward to it.  Im gonna name it Pace no matter if its a 

boy or a girl.  Pace Ripley sounds good, dont it?  Its

kind of hard to believe that Pace will be six years old 

when you get out.

I feel like Im kind of in prison too, but I know in six

months, itll be over and Ill have a son or daughter to

show for it.  Our child!!

I love you Sailor.  I dont know how much or what it 

means though I miss you an awful bunch sometimes I know

youre thinking about me cause I can feel it.  I miss

you not being around to call me peanut nobody else ever

called me that.

Mama married Santos.  It just about drove me crazy.  My

daddy left a lot of money somehow and theyre spending

it like there is no tomorrow.  Im going to move out as

soon as I can.

Mama and Santos said because of the baby theyre lookin

at the two of us in a different light - whatever that

means.

Johnnie Farragut has plumb disappeared.  No one knows

where.  I miss him, but not near as much as I miss you.

Time dont really fly honey does it?

Love,

your Lula

P.S. I miss dancing...

151. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

Lula sits in her bedroom reading a letter from Sailor.

				SAILOR

			(voice-over)

Dear Lula,

It is fine with me about the baby as you already know. 

And Pace being your family name and all is just right.

What about a middle name if it is a boy after my 

granddaddy Roscoe?  He would be proud I know though

he is long passed.  Pace Roscoe Ripley does not sound

so bad do you think?

This place is not so pretty as Pee Dee.  Not pretty

at all.  There are boys inside these walls meaner

than Peru you can bet.  There is a Death House.  I

am getting along.  The only thing is not thinking

about the future.

I miss dancing with you, too.  I love you.  It is

hard to end this letter.  If I stop writing youre

gone.  There is not a lot more to say though.

Vava con dios mi amor.

Sailor

LONG FADE OUT:

153. INT. LULA FORTUNES HOUSE - EVENING - (SIX YEARS LATER)

Six years later...  Lula stands in the living room holding a glass of 

ice water while talking on the telephone to her mother.  Marietta is 

wearing a giant diamond ring on one hand and the other hand is holding a 

Martini and Rossi sweet vermouth.  Marietta is slumped over in an 

ottoman with wheels and is pushing her drunken self around the 

livingroom as she talks on the phone.

				LULA

		Im goin, mama.  No way I cant go.

				MARIETTA

		You aint takin Pace, though.

				LULA

		Course I am, mama.

				MARIETTA

			(sighs)

		What times Sailors train get in?

				LULA

		Six.

				MARIETTA

		Got any plans?

				LULA

		Figure well go have supper someplace.

		Maybe get some barbecue out by 

		Stateline.  Sailor always liked that

		Havana Browns Pig Pickin.

				MARIETTA

		Well, you be careful with that boy,

		Lula.

				LULA

		Sailor aint a boy no more, mama.

				MARIETTA

		Dont mean him.  Its Pace concerns me.

				LULA

		Really, mama, I gotta go.

				MARIETTA

		What if I asked you not to?

				LULA

		Wouldnt make any difference.

				MARIETTA

		What if I told you not to?

				LULA

			(forcefully)

		Mama ... if you get in the way of

		me and Sailors happiness, Ill

		fuckin pull your arms out by the

		roots.

Lula hangs up and throws her glass of water at a picture of her mother - 

draining it.

								CUT TO:

154. INT. LULAS CAR - EVENING

PACE ROSCOE FORTUNE is a shy, polite, innocent six-year old who wears a 

long-billed fishing cap and pants with suspenders.

				PACE

		Howll we know what he looks like?

Lula makes a wide left turn onto Jeff Davis Highway without signaling, 

causing the driver of a white Bonneville headed across the intersection 

to jam on his brakes in order to avoid a collision.  The Bonneville 

driver sits on his horn and shouts at Lula.

				PACE

		Mama, you almost crashed us.

Lula steadies the steering wheel of her Camaro with her left elbow while 

she strikes a match and lights up a More.  She throws the match out the 

window and takes possession of the wheel with both hands, the cigarette 

is clamped in her teeth.

				LULA

		Dont give me no trouble now, Pace,

		please.  This aint the easiest day

		in a long time.  And what do you

		mean how are we gonna know what your

		daddy looks like?  You seen his photo.

				PACE

		Howll he know what we look like?

		He seen our photo?

Lula puffs furiously several times on her More before she takes it out 

of her mouth and drops it.

				LULA

		Damn it, child!  Now look what you

		made me do.

				PACE

		What I made you do, mama?

Lula feels around on the floor with one hand until she finds the 

cigarette.  Sirens can be heard up ahead.

				LULA

		Nothin, honey. 

		  (stubbing it out in the ashtray)

		Mamas just actin strange.

				PACE

		You aint actin, mama.

				LULA

		Why, Pace Roscoe Ripley, aint you

		got one cute mouth tonight?

They pass an automobile accident where a man has been thrown into the 

curb - his head broken open and bleeding.  The ambulance is just 

arriving.  Lula looks away.

								CUT TO:

155. ACCIDENT - EVENING

A CRAZY MAN in a wheelchair is wheel up to the accident victim, who is 

bleeding profusely and in a state of shock.  The man in the wheelchair 

stares at him for a moment.

				WHEELCHAIR MAN

		Hey man...  HEY...  Same fuckin

Pace looks up at his mother.

				PACE

		color hair is like mine.

				PACE

		My daddy aint never killed nobody,

		has he, mama?

				LULA

		Course he aint never killed nobody.

		Whyd you say that, Pace?

				PACE

		Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama

		talkin.

				LULA

		And?

				PACE

		Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.

				LULA

		Wrong, baby.  Your daddy never 

		committed no murder.  Musta been you 

		didnt hear grandmama proper.  He made 

		some mistakes, is all.  Your daddy aint 

		always been so lucky...  Were almost

		at the depot, honey.  Sit back a minute.

								CUT TO:

157. EXT. TRAIN STATION - EVENING

Lula pulls the Camaro into in the station parking lot and kills the 

engine.

				PACE

		Why we sittin here, mama?

				LULA

		Thinkin a second, baby.

Lula gets out and goes around for Pace.  They hold hands as they walk 

toward the station.  The big clock on the side of the building shows ten 

minutes past six.

				PACE

		Im scared, mama.

				LULA

		Why, honey?

				PACE

		Case daddy dont like me.  What if

		he dont like that I dont got 

		his color hair.

				LULA

		Pace, your daddyd love you even

		if you didnt have no hair at all.

CUT TO:								

158. INT. TRAIN STATION - EVENING

Lula sees Sailor as soon as she opens the door.  He is sitting in an 

orange plastic chair against the opposite wall, smoking a cigarette.

				LULA

		Still partial to Camels, huh?

Sailor smiles.

				SAILOR

		First pack of tailor-mades I had in

		a while.

He stands up and looks down at Pace, who is still holding hands with 

Lula.  Sailor puts out his right hand.

				SAILOR

		You must be my son.

				LULA

		Shake hands with your daddy.

Pace releases Lulas hand and puts his own in Sailors.  Sailor grips it 

gently but firmly, pumps once, then lets go.

				SAILOR

		Pleasure to meet you, Pace.  I read

		a lot about you.

Sailor looks at Lula.  Her eyes are full of tears and she lets them 

loose.  Sailor tries to smile.

				LULA

		You hungry?  Pace and I aint had

		dinner yet.

				SAILOR

		Lead the way.

Sailor picks up his black metal suitcase and follows them to the car.

CUT TO:								

159. INT. LULAS CAR - NIGHT

Lula drives.

				SAILOR

		No rag top, huh?

Lula starts to reply, then stops.  She stares straight ahead, gripping 

the wheel hard.  Suddenly, she pulls over to the side of the road, turns 

off the engine and gets out of the car.

				PACE

		Whats wrong, mama?

				SAILOR

		     (turning to Pace and 

			patting his head)

		Dont worry, son.  Just stay here.

Sailor gets out and goes over to Lula, who is leaning back against the 

hood.

				LULA

		Im sorry, Sailor.  I just cant 

		help it.  Give me a minute and Ill

		quit.

				SAILOR

		Boys frightened, Lula.  This aint

		no good.

				LULA

		Really, Sail, Ill be okay.

				SAILOR

		Its a mistake, honey.  You two go on.

		Ill walk back to the depot.

				LULA

		Whatre you talkin about?  Thats 

		your son in there.

				SAILOR

		He aint never known me, Lula, so 

		there aint much for him to forget.

		Not seein each other for six years

		makes it next best to simple for us, too.

				LULA

		How can you say that, Sailor?

				SAILOR

		What makes sense, is all.

Sailor goes around to the drivers side, reaches in and pulls the keys 

out of the ignition.  He unlocks the trunk, removes his suitcase, and 

closes the lid.

				LULA

		Dont do this, Sailor, please.

Sailor slips the keys in her shirt pocket and leans his head into the 

car.

				SAILOR

			(to Pace)

		Oiga, amigo.  If ever somethin 

		dont feel right to you, remember what

		Pancho said to The Cisco Kid...  

		Lets went, before we are dancing at

		the end of a rope, without music.

Sailor stands up and looks at Lula.  Her eye makeup runs in dark streaks 

down her face.

ECU of Lulas eyes.  Her eye makeup runs like black sweat over eyes and 

down her cheeks as in Sailors dream.

				SAILOR

		You been doin fine without me, peanut. 

		There aint no need to make life 

		toughern it has to be.

He picks up his suitcase, kisses Lula lightly on the lips and walks 

away.  She lets him go.

								CUT TO:

160. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Sailor walks down the street pretending hard not to care.

								CUT TO:

161. INT. LULAS CAR - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Lula climbs in behind the wheel - sobbing.  Pace sits sadly, staring out 

the window.

								CUT TO:

162. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Sailor continues walking down the street.  A GANG OF INSANE KILLER 

TEENAGERS on PCP appear and come towards Sailor.  They circle around 

him, coming in closer for the kill.

				SAILOR

		What do you faggots want?

Thats all it takes.  The gang is on him.  Sailor tries to defend 

himself, but one big punch to his nose sends him down and out.  Blood 

begins to pour from his swelling nose.

162A. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

CU OF SAILORS FACE - a bright light illuminates it.

In the sky above Sailor, a large glowing bubble holding the beautiful 

Good Witch of the North comes floating down above him.

				GOOD WITCH

		Sailor Ripley...

Sailors eyes suddenly see the Good Witch through his closed eyelids.  

His mouth speaks through closed lips.

				SAILOR

		The Good Witch...

				GOOD WITCH

		Sailor...  Lula loves you.

				SAILOR

		But Im a robber and a manslaughterer

		and I havent had any parental 

		guidance.

				GOOD WITCH

		Shes forgiven you of all these things

		...  You love her...  Dont be

		afraid, Sailor.

				SAILOR

		But Im wild at heart.

				GOOD WITCH

		If you are truly wild at heart, youll

		fight for your dreams...  Dont turn

		away from love, Sailor...  Dont turn

		away from love...  Dont turn away

		from love.

The Good Witch disappears.

162. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Sailor opens his eyes and drags himself and his giant swollen nose up on 

his feet.  The gang still stands around him.

				GANG MEMBER

		You had enough, asshole?

				SAILOR

		Yes, I have...  And I wanna apologize

		to you gentlemen for referring to 

		you as homosexuals.  I also want to

		thank you fellas, youve taught me

		a valuable lesson in life.  

			(lifts his head high)

		LULA!!!!

Sailor turns around and starts running back.  The gang watches him go.

								CUT TO:

163. INT. LULAS CAR - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Lula sits in the car in the middle of a giant traffic jam.  She is still 

crying and horns are honking all around them.

								CUT TO:

164. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Sailor runs up the street, holding his nose and SCREAMING LULAS NAME.

He rounds a corner and spots her in the middle of a sea of cars.

He starts running towards her - leaping from one car to another until he 

jumps on the hood of Lulas car.

She sees him.

				SAILOR

		LULA!!!!

				LULA

		SAILOR!!!!

Lula wriggles out of the car and flys into his arms.  Behind them is a 

giant golden sunset.  As they embrace - the sound of the horns goes 

away.  Lulas gaze goes to a reflection of golden light on a windshield.  

It is the same abstract scene she saw before in her room in Big Tuna, 

but now she knows what it is.  It is Paces happy, smiling eyes looking 

up at the two of them in love.

Sailor, with a giant blue nose, looks into Lulas eyes and sings Love 

Me Tender. 

The people in their cars, and the people on the street look on with a 

feeling of love and happiness in their hearts.

THE END
