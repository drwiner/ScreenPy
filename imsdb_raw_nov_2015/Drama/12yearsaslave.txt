          1 INT. TOWNHOUSE/STUDY - DAY 1

           -EARLY APRIL, 1841-

           We are close on a PAIR OF BLACK HANDS as they open A

           FINELY WRAPPED PACKET OF VIOLIN STRINGS.

           WE CUT TO the hands stringing a VIOLIN. It's not a high

           end piece, but it is quite nice.

           WE CUT TO a wide shot of the study. Sitting in a chair

           with violin in hand is SOLOMON NORTHUP; a man in his late

           twenties. Everything about Solomon, his mien and manner,

           is distinguished. But he, too, seems a hardy individual.

           Someone who has known manual labor in his time.

           Solomon begins to lightly play his violin, as if testing

           the strings, their tuning. Satisfied, Solomon begins to

           play vigorously. As he does, we make a HARD CUT TO:

           INT. HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           We come in on a lively affair. A dinner party is being

           thrown within the confines of a fairly stately house. In

           attendance are EIGHT COUPLES. All are WHITE and all are

           FAIRLY YOUNG, in their early twenties. The men and women

           are dressed in very fine attire. We should get the sense

           that for the most part they are people of means.

           The furniture has been set aside in the living room. At

           the moment the couples are engaged in the dancing of a

           REEL.

           The music they are dancing to is being played by Solomon,

           having cut directly from the tune he was previously

           playing. He plays with a light determination, and in no

           way seems possessed with empty servitude.

           Solomon concludes the reel, and the dancers break into

           enthusiastic applause, which is followed by personal

           thanks and congratulations from all. It should be clear

           that despite their respective races there is much

           admiration and appreciation for Solomon's abilities.

           INT. NORTHUP HOUSE/BEDROOM - MORNING

           It is a Saturday morning. Clad in her finest attire is

           ANNE; Solomon's wife, a few years younger than he. We

           see also the Northup children: MARGARET who is eight, and

           ALONZO who is five. They are handsome, and well groomed

           kids. Anne straightens up the children. She finishes,

                          (CONTINUED)

          2.

                         3 CONTINUED: 3

           she rises up and stands behind them, almost as if

           preparing to pose for a portrait.

           They all wait a moment, then Solomon enters the foyer.

           He stands and looks admiringly at his family. ADMIRINGLY

           stressed. It isn't that he doesn't have love for them,

           he does as well. But in the moment, he truly admires his

           greatest accomplishment: a family that is healthy and

           well and provided for. He goes to his children, and

           hands each a coin, then goes to Anne. Gives her a kiss

           on the cheek. The children giggle at the sight.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Solomon and his family are out walking along the streets

           and groves of Saratoga.

           The streets are well populated this morning with many

           people out strolling. Most are WHITE, but there are

           BLACKS as well. They are FREED BLACKS who mingle fairly

           easily - though not always completely - with the whites.

           We see, too, a few BLACK SLAVES who travel with their

           WHITE MASTERS. These pairings are largely from the south

           and - despite the fact the blacks are slaves - they are

           not physically downtrodden, not field hands. They are

           well dressed and "leading apparently an easy life" -

           comparatively speaking - as they trail their masters.

           As they walk, Solomon and his family arrive to an

           intersection well-worn and muddied from horse and cart

           traffic. Solomon and his children easily jump across the

           muck. Anne stands at the lip of the puddle, calls for

           Solomon to help her across.

                          ANNE

           Solomon...

           Solomon, turning back to his wife with a broad smile

           waving her forward:

                          SOLOMON

           Come, Anne. Jump.

           The children, now smiling as well, egg their mother on.

                          ALONZO MARGARET

           Jump. You can make it. I've done it. You can make

           it.

                          ANNE

           I will not ruin my dress. Catch

           me!

           Solomon moves close, holds out his arms. Yet, there's

           still just a bit of mischievousness in his eyes. Anne

           gives her husband a lightly stern look to which Solomon

           replies.

                          (CONTINUED)

          3.

                          SOLOMON

           I will catch you, Anne.

                          (BEAT)

           I will.

           Again, lightly stern:

                          ANNE

           You will.

           And with that Anne takes the leap. Solomon catches her,

           swings her around grandly and sets her down lightly to

           the delighted applause of the children. That done,

           Solomon takes Anne's hand and leads her on.

           As Solomon and his family make their way, among the

           slaves on the street, we see one in particular; JASPER.

           As he trails his MASTER he can't help but note Solomon

           and his family as they enter A STORE. His intrigue of

           this most handsome and harmonious group should be

           obvious.

           With his Master occupied, Jasper moves slyly toward the

           STORE. Frozen on the spot, Jasper looks on admiringly.

           Suddenly a voice barks out-

           A VOICE (O.S.)

           Jasper! Come on!

           INT. STORE - LATER

           We are inside the store of MR. CEPHAS PARKER; a white man

           and a supplier of general goods. Solomon greets him

                          WITH:

                          SOLOMON

           Mr. Parker.

                          PARKER

           Mr. Northup. Mrs. Northup.

           With money in hand the Northup children move quickly

           about the store looking for items to purchase.

                          CONTINUED:

           Anne looks over some silks and fabrics. Parker suggests

                          TO SOLOMON:

                          PARKER (CONT'D)

           A new cravat, Solomon? Pure silk

           by way of the French.

                          SOLOMON

           We are in need of a fresh carry

           all for the Mrs's travels.

                          PARKER

           A year's passed? Off to Sandy

           Hill?

                          ANNE

           I am.

           Using a long pole, Mr. Parker fetches down a CARRY ALL

           from an upper shelf.

                          PARKER

           Something to suit your style, but

           sturdy enough for the forty miles

           round trip.

           Handing the Bag to Anne, she is immediately taken by it.

                          ANNE

           It's beautiful.

                          SOLOMON

                          (CAUTIOUSLY)

           At what price?

                          ANNE

           We will take it. Children, come

           see what your father has just

           purchased for me.

           As the children run over - chattering excitedly about the

           new gift - they RUN PAST JASPER who has quietly entered

           the store.

           At the checkout counter sits a portrait of WILLIAM HENRY

           HARRISON, the edges draped in black crepe. Before the

           book sits a LEDGER. Mr. Parker asks of Solomon:

                          PARKER

           If you would sign our condolence

           book. My hope is to find a way to

           forward it to the Widow Harrison.

           Sad days for the nation.

                          SOLOMON

           Yes, certainly. Poor Mrs. Harris

           and her children. I hope brighter

           times ahead.

           Jasper looks scared, timid. It's as though he'd like to

           engage, but is unsure of as to how. Noting Jasper, Parker

                          SAYS:

                          PARKER

           A moment, sir, and you will be

           assisted.

                          SOLOMON

           If we could discuss the price...

                         5 CONTINUED: (3) 5

                          PARKER

           Forgive me, Mrs. Northup. A

           customer waits. Welcome, sir.

           To Jasper, with good nature:

                          SOLOMON

           Shop well, but mind your wallet.

                          PARKER

           Ignore the gentleman's nonsense.

           Now, may I interest you in a new

           cravat? Pure silk by way of the--

           Before Parker can finish, the door opens. It's Jasper's

           Master, FITZGERALD. He's stern, clearly displeased.

                          FITZGERALD

           Jasper!

                          (TO PARKER)

           My regrets for the intrusion.

                          SOLOMON

           No intrusion.

           Fitzgerald looks to Solomon. It is a cold glare as

           though he wasn't speaking to, and has no interest in a

           response from a black man. Looking back to Parker:

                          FITZGERALD

           Good day, sir.

                         6 6

           INT. NORTHUP HOUSE/DINING ROOM - EVENING

           Anne, busy in the kitchen, puts the final touches to the

           meal, which is just about to begin. Solomon, in the

           meanwhile, sits at the head of the table reading from a

           NEWSPAPER. He reads to his children solemn news of the

           funeral arrangements for the recently deceased President

           Harrison.

                          SOLOMON

           "Thus has passed away from earth

           our late President."

           Solomon starts from the top of the article.

                          SOLOMON (CONT'D)

           "During the morning, from sunrise,

           the heavy bells had been pealing

           forth their slow and solemn toll

           while the minute guns announced

           that soon the grave would receive

           its trust. Our city as well as

           our entire nation has been called

           to weep over the fall of a great

           and good man. One who was by the

           wishes of a large majority of our

           William Henry Harrison."

           A long moment of quiet, the family continuing to eat.

           Then, from Margaret:

                          MARGARET

           Will you read it again?

                          ANNE

           Not just now, darling.

           Anne enters the dining room and places a large chicken at

           the center of the table. As she takes a seat, all heads

           are bowed.

                          MARGARET

           For food that stays our hunger,

           For rest that brings us ease,

           For homes where memories linger,

           We give our thanks for these.

                          ALL

           Amen.

                          SOLOMON

           Margaret, that was wonderful.

                          MARGARET

           Thank you, Papa.

                          SOLOMON

           Alonzo, do you have something to

           say?

                          ALONZO

           Yes, I helped Momma make this.

                          ANNE

           Yes, and you were such a good

           help. Especially making the gravy.

                          MARGARET

           Papa, I would very much like to

           learn how to play the violin.

           Could you teach me?

                          ALONZO

           Me too!

                          MARGARET

           Yes, but I asked Papa first.

                          SOLOMON

           Both of you, calm down. We will

           have our first lesson after this

           wonderful dinner. And on that

           note, let's start eating.

          7 INT. NORTHUP HOUSE - NIGHT 7

           Solomon and Anne have fun and difficulty putting the

           unruly children to bed. They are tucked in, and each

           given a kiss good night. As Margaret lays down to sleep,

           Anne blows out the candle darkening the room.

           Silhouetted in the doorway, Solomon takes Anne in his

           arms, holds her tightly as they both luxuriate in the

           simple, beautiful gift that is their children.

           INT. NORTHUP HOUSE - NIGHT

           Now alone together, we see Anne and Solomon wrapped in

           each other's arms. Beyond being physically close,

           emotionally close, they are just so very comfortable with

           one another. They are the very representation of a

           couple who are made for each other.

           They look at each other for a prolonged time.

                          (COMICALLY FORLORN) 

           Three weeks. Two days. 

                          ANNE 

           It is the custom. I wonder what 

           you'll do without me? 

                          SOLOMON 

           I won't stay idle. 

           SOLOMON's eyes lower. 

                          ANNE 

           Darling, it's good money. 

                          SOLOMON 

           If only I didn't have to share 

           your cooking with other people. 

           ANNE holds his gaze. 

                          ANNE 

           You don't.

          9 EXT. NORTHUP HOUSE - MORNING 9

           We are just outside the Northup house. A CARRIAGE waits

           with a DRIVER. Anne and the children are dressed for

           travel - Anne sporting HER NEW CARRY ALL. The Driver

           loads bags into the carriage.

           For her parting gift, Anne gives her husband a kiss.

                          SOLOMON

           Travel safely.

                          ANNE

           Stay safely.

           Anne and the children loaded up, the Driver chides the

           horse and the carriage heads off. Solomon waves a hearty

           good bye to his wife and children.

           EXT. PARK - DAY

           Solomon is now out for a stroll. He passes two men - two

           in particular - who stand outside conversing with MR.

           MOON himself: MERRILL BROWN and ABRAM HAMILTON. Brown

           is about 40, with a countenance indicating shrewdness and

           intelligence. Hamilton is closer to 25, a man of fair

           complexion and light eyes. Both are finely, if perhaps a

           bit garishly, dressed. Hamilton, as Solomon describes

           him, slightly effeminate.

           Moon, spotting Solomon:

           MR. MOON

           Call the Devil's name... There he

           is now. Mr. Northup...! I have

           two gentlemen who should make your

           acquaintance. Messrs. Brown and

           Hamilton.

                          BROWN

           Sir.

           MR. MOON

           Mr. Northup, these two gentlemen

           were inquiring about distinguished

           individuals, and I was just this

           very moment telling them that

           player on the violin.

           He was indeed.

           Mr. Moon is being overly gracious.

           EXT. PARK/PAVILION - LATER

           We make a jump to a green space. Solomon, Brown and

           Hamilton are sitting at a bench.

                          SOLOMON

           A circus?

                          HAMILTON

           That is our usual employee. The

           company currently in the city of

           Washington.

                          BROWN

           Circus too constricting a word to

           describe the talented and merry

           band with which we travel. It is

           a spectacle unlike most have ever

           witnessed. Creatures from the

           darkest Africa as yet unseen by

           civilized man. Acrobats from the

           Orient able to contort themselves

           in the most confounding manners.

                          HAMILTON

           And I myself in aide of Mr. Brown;

           an internationally renowned

           practitioner in the art of

           prestidigitation.

                          BROWN

           We are on our way thither to

           rejoin the company having left for

           a short time to make a small

           profit from our own exhibitions.

                          HAMILTON

           The reason for our inquiry with

           Mr. Moon...

                          BROWN

           Yes. We had just a devil of a

           time in procuring music for our

           talent seemingly in short supply.

                          SOLOMON

           Thank you sir...

                          BROWN

           If we could persuade you to

           accompany us as far as New York...

           We would give you one dollar for

           each day's service and three

           dollars for every night played at

           our performances. In addition we

           would provide sufficient pay for

           the expenses of your return from

           New York here to Saratoga.

                          SOLOMON

           You understand this is all very

           sudden.

                          HAMILTON

           Consider it an opportunity to see

                          THE COUNTRY--

                          SOLOMON

           It's intriguing...

                          HAMILTON

           If there is any way in which you

           would give consideration to the

           offer...

           Solomon gives the whole deal one last consideration.

                          SOLOMON

           The payment offered is enticement

           enough, as is my desire to visit

           the metropolis.

                          HAMILTON

           We are delighted, sir. So

           delighted. Though we would add

           that our travel plans--

                          BROWN

           We would like to depart with

           write her of our plans.

                          BROWN

           Excellent! I would beg you

           collect yourself, then we may

           Back in his house, we see Solomon packing: putting some

           clothes in a travel case, and collecting his violin as

           well.

          13 INT. NORTHUP HOUSE/STUDY - LATER 13

           Solomon sits down to write a letter; pen poised over

           paper with already a few lines written. But Solomon

           thinks better of it. WITH LITTLE THOUGHT HE TEARS THE

           PAPER AND SETS IT ASIDE. WE SHOULD GET THE SENSE THAT

           THE ABSOLUTE VALUE OF BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE BY LETTER

           IS LOST ON SOLOMON. THIS FACT WILL HAVE GREAT WEIGHT IN

           THE NEAR FUTURE.

           Solomon enters the buggy, carpet bag in hand. Brown and

           Hamilton are waiting. They ride in a covered carriage

           led by a pair of "noble" horses.

                          HAMILTON

           No letter to post?

                          SOLOMON

           No need. My return will coincide

           with my family's.

                          BROWN

           We're off then.

           INT. PUB - EVENING

           -MID TO LATE APRIL, 1841-

           We find ourselves in a roadside pub. It serves the

           purpose of drinking and diversion, and little more. As

           Solomon plays his violin, Brown and Hamilton perform a

           decent, paired magic routine before a SPARSE AUDIENCE NOT

           OF "SELECT CHARACTER."

          11.

          16 INT. PUB - LATER 16

           After the show, the pub now fairly empty, Solomon,

           Hamilton and Brown sit down to eat. Hamilton and Brown

           drink, but again Solomon abstains. Though Solomon

           remains cool, Hamilton and Brown put up a great show of

           being disappointed as Hamilton counts out what little

           money was collected.

                          HAMILTON

           Not an additional tip from a one

           of them. They expect to be

           entertained for nothing.

                          BROWN

           And not satisfied a bit despite

           giving them more than what they

           paid for.

                          SOLOMON

           It's the national mood. There's

           too much grief to make room for

           frivolity.

                          HAMILTON

           My sincerest apologies, Solomon.

           You were promised opportunity, and

           you were given none.

                          BROWN

           The opportunity is with the

           circus. A two man show poorly

           promoted, what were we to expect?

           But the circus bills itself.

                          HAMILTON

           True.

                          BROWN

           I have told you of the circus with

           which we are connected. Creatures

           from the darkest of Africa.

           Acrobats from the Orient who--

                          SOLOMON

           You have described it, yes.

                          BROWN

           Yes. We need to return

           immediately to Washington.

           Solomon...I believe us familiar

           enough now, but forgive me if I am

           bold...would you consider making

           the trip with us?

           Solomon gives a bit of a laugh at the idea.

           Entertaining at pubs and inns has

           it's place, but a man of your

           skills deserves better.

                          BROWN

           Hear, hear.

                          HAMILTON

           And more importantly you would

           build your own name and following.

           The circus tends to attract those

           with the highest of reputations.

           An introduction here and there

           could amount to a lifetime of

           reward. Now would be the time.

           With your family away, an

           opportunity presents itself.

                          BROWN

           Said as fellow artists as well as

           businessmen. Well worth the

           effort at least.

                          SOLOMON

           You present a flattering

           representation. As my family will

           be traveling back shortly, perhaps

           I might commit only to one trial

           engagement.

                          HAMILTON

           Oh, very good, sir. Very good. I

           cannot recall being so excited.

                          BROWN

           There is a practical concern. If

           you are to continue on with us you

           should obtain your free papers.

                          SOLOMON

           Not necessary.

                          BROWN

           Here in New York, no. But we will

           be entering slave states and as a

           matter of precaution... It's to

           all our benefit we should not have

           to come to account for your well

           being.

                          HAMILTON

           Six shillings worth of effort

           could well save much trouble

           later.

          18 EXT. WASHINGTON - DAY 18

           The city is a swarm of people. At the moment the populace

           is displaying both sorrow and anticipation. Sorrow for

           the loss of the President. Many are dressed in black,

           and black crepe hangs nearly everywhere. Black armbands

           are frequently seen, and the occasional American Flag

           hung at half mast. As well, there are portraits of

           Harrison at varying locations.

           Having arrived in Washington, Solomon, Hamilton and Brown

           RIDE ONWARD IN THEIR CARRIAGE.

           joint. Very lively. Solomon, Hamilton and Brown are

           among several parties drinking in the hotel's bar. As

           with seemingly everywhere in the city black crepes

           accessorize the background. Brown counts out $43.00 IN

           COIN on the tabletop. Solomon is astonished by the

           amount.

                          BROWN

           Forty-three dollars. All to you.

                          SOLOMON

           That...it's far more than my wages

           amount to.

                          BROWN

           Consider the remainder an advance

           from the circus. I cannot tell

           you...I honestly wish you had seen

           the expression of our director

           when I described your abilities.

           He was fairly overcome with

           excitement.

           You should have invited him to sup

           with us.

           to depart.

           praise of men to receive the

           WE MAKE A HARD CUT to Solomon outside of the Pub, in an

           alley, with Brown and Hamilton in silhouette, back-lit by

           the street lights. He is violently ill, hunched over and

           retching horribly.

                          HAMILTON

           That's all right Solomon. No

           Hamilton and Brown help Solomon to lumber up the spiral

           staircase, passing the occasional bemused guest.

          23 INT. GADSBY HOTEL/SOLOMON'S ROOM - NIGHT 23

           Hamilton is placing a spittoon near Solomon's bed, where

           a prone and reeling Solomon lays. Hamilton sits on the

           bed. As he strokes Solomon's sweaty face, Hamilton

           speaks sweetly.

                          HAMILTON

           I'm afraid that Brown and I

           haven't brought you much luck.

           But rough waters bring smooth

           sailing. Eventually they do.

                          SOLOMON

           ....So...so sorry...

                          HAMILTON

           Shhh. We won't hear it. We

           won't.

                          BROWN

           Let him sleep.

                          HAMILTON

           Hmm. A good night's sleep. And

           tomorrow...tomorrow you will feel

           as well and refreshed as though

           the earth were new again.

           Hamilton lingers a bit too long and a bit too close to

           Solomon for Brown's taste. With more than a bit of

                          SIGNIFICATION:

                          BROWN

           Hamilton! Nothing more we can do

           for him.

                          HAMILTON

           Such is the pity.

           Displaying an odd sort of disappointment, Hamilton slinks

           away from the bed. He crosses to, and BLOWS OUT A

           CANDLE. The room goes dark with a blackness more than

           night. Brown and Hamilton exit. Solomon lays in the

           dark and moans. His sounds becoming MORE AND MORE

           DISTRESSED.

           Solomon stirs, then slowly awakes to his new

           circumstances. He finds himself in a nearly lightless

           room about twelve feet square with walls of solid

           masonry. There is a thick and well-locked door, a small

           window covered with iron bars and a shutter. The only

           furniture is a wood stool and an old fashioned, dirty box

           stove. As Solomon rises he sees that his HANDS are

           CUFFED - the chain running to a bolt in the ground - and

           his LEGS IN IRONS. At first Solomon is incredulous. But

           that emotion is replaced first by fury and then panic.

           He begins to pull on the chains, fight against them. He

           does so with increasing desperation. Solomon flails

           about, the sounds of the steel chains whipping and

           beating against the masonry. He grunts and screams

           without regard as the cuffs and irons bite into his

           flesh, but he cannot pull himself free.

           After several minutes of intense effort, Solomon tires,

           slows, then finally he collapses. And in this collapsed

           state he remains.

                         25 25

           INT. BURCH'S DUNGEON - MORNING

           Solomon again awakens. He hears sounds beyond the

           door...footsteps. Eventually the door opens. Enter

           JAMES BURCH - who runs the slave pen - and EBENEZER

           RADBURN who works as a turnkey and overseer.

           As the door opens, this is the first light to seep into

           the otherwise near-black room. The shine is painful to

           Solomon's eyes. With no salutation whatsoever, Burch

                          ASKS:

                          BURCH

           Well, my boy, how yah feel now?

           Solomon rises up as best he can. With all the resolve he

           can put together he states what he considers to be fact:

                          SOLOMON

           I am Solomon Northup. I am a free

           man; a resident of Saratoga, New

           York. The residence also of my

           wife and children who are equally

           free. I have papers. You have no

           right whatsoever to detain me--

                          BURCH

           Yah not any--

                          SOLOMON

           And I promise you - I promise -

           upon my liberation I will have

           satisfaction for this wrong.

                          BURCH

           Resolve this. Produce your

           papers.

                          (CONTINUED)

          17.

                         25 CONTINUED: 25

           With confidence Solomon goes to the pocket of his

           trousers. He searches one, then the other, but they are

           empty. He feels quickly about himself, but clearly his

           papers have been lifted. Solomon's confidence shifts,

           but to resolve rather than fear. Papers or none, he will

           not be easily cowed. Still, Burch asserts:

                          BURCH (CONT'D)

           Yah no free man. And yah ain't

           from Saratoga. Yah from Georgia.

           A moment. Not a word spoken among the trio, but Solomon

           and Burch do some serious eye fucking, neither man

           yielding. Burch says again:

                          BURCH (CONT'D)

           Yah ain't a free man. Yah nuthin'

           but a Georgia runaway.

           Burch waits for Solomon to acquiesce. Solomon does not

           in any way. Both men exchange a long and daring stare.

           The two are clearly at an intellectual stand off. Burch,

           leans to Radburn, SAYS SOMETHING WHICH WE CANNOT

           DISTINGUISH.

           Radburn walks off-camera and returns with a pair of

           "instruments:" a PADDLE - the flattened portion, which is

           about the size in circumference of two open hands, and

           bored with a small auger in numerous places. He also

           carries a WHIP. A cat-o-nine tails; a large rope of many

           strands. The strands unraveled and a knot tied at the

           extremity of each. Burch says again:

                          BURCH (CONT'D)

           Yah a runaway nigger from Georgia.

           Solomon stands with a quiet stoicism. He will say

           nothing of the kind.

           As that is the case, Solomon is seized by both men. He is

           pulled over the bench, face downward, shirt still on his

           back. Radburn then STEPS ON HIS CHAINS, holding Solomon

           down in a bent position.

           With no preamble, Burch begins to beat Solomon about the

           back with the paddle. Burch strikes him wordlessly - no

           taunting, no sneering. Solomon screaming against each

           blow. His back immediately SWELLING WITH WELTS AND

           BRUISES.

           This beating continues on and on and on until quite

           literally Burch WEARS HIMSELF OUT with the effort.

           Dripping in sweat and panting:

           Yah still insist yah a free man?

                          SOLOMON

           ...I...I insist...

           Burch regrets hearing this. Not from sympathy, but

           rather because he's nearly too tired to go back to

           beating Solomon. Yet, as if returning to work, Burch

           returns to pummeling Solomon. Burch punctuates the blows

                          WITH:

                          BURCH

           Yah a slave. Yah a Georgia slave!

           Burch continues to strike, and strike... This time until

           the paddle SNAPS IN HALF. Burch then GRABS THE WHIP.

           Hardly missing a stroke, he whips Solomon relentlessly,

           the flails cutting into Solomon's back. Again, Burch's

           arm tires before Solomon "breaks."

                          BURCH (CONT'D)

           Are yah slave?

                          SOLOMON

           ...No...

           Burch goes back to whipping and whipping, and whipping...

           SOLOMON'S BACK IS NOW TORN OPEN WITH LACERATIONS AND

           OOZING WITH BLOOD. Finally Burch can whip no more. He

           pours sweat and sucks air, leaving himself just enough

           energy to take up his instruments and EXIT. Radburn

           lingers for a moment. He takes the irons off Solomon's

           legs. Opens the window some. As he makes these

           gestures, in a patronizing and confidential manner, one

           wrought with poor sincerity::

                          RADBURN

           I seen a good many of the black

           kind just where yah're. Sick.

           Make me sick. Often times the

           situation was resolved, and I

           think; what was all the beatin'

           and abuse for? Things end as they

           should, and the violence was for

           naught. So why cause trouble when

           they ain't no cause for it? Be of

           a cooperative nature, and things

           don't need be particularly

           unpleasant.

                          (BEAT)

           Or, yah can carry on like yah

           been, and I fear yah won't live to

           see Sunday next.

           With that thought, Radburn exits. Solomon rests. But to

           rest seems like giving in to defeat. He begins pulling

                          (CONTINUED)

           on his chains. But for all his struggling, the chain

           loosens none. Solomon calls out:

                          SOLOMON

           Help me! Someone help me!

           If anyone at all hears him, they do not respond. Solomon

           continues his plaintive cry for assistance.

           Beginning with a TIGHT SHOT on the shuttered, barred

           window of Burch's dungeon - Solomon's cries barely eking

           beyond the space - THE CAMERA PULLS BACK from the

           building, onto the city until clearly visible is the

           Nation's capital. It's icon's of freedom - the WHITE

           HOUSE, the CAPITOL BUILDING - fairly mocking Solomon's

           captivity. Simultaneously, barren at the early hour and

           cluttered with litter and the remains of previous day's

           procession, the city is a bleak and forboding sight.

          30 EXT. BURCH'S DUNGEON/YARD - DAY 30

           It is a yard just beyond Burch's. The yard is hemmed in

           by a brick wall. In the yard are two men, and a boy.

           The oldest is CLEMENS RAY a man of about 25 years of age.

           He is well educated. JOHN WILLIAMS is about 20 years

           old. He is born and bred a slave, is lacking in

           education, and overwhelmed with fear of the situation.

           Finally there is a child about 10 years of age who

           answers to the name of Randall.

           Solomon, Clemens Ray, John and Randall ALL STAND NAKED.

           Though they try to cover their privates a bit, they are

           all aware of the uselessness of modesty. Radburn is

           present. He has before him A COUPLE OF BUCKETS OF COLD

           WATER. He throws water on the naked men.

                          RADBURN

           Go on. Warsh up.

           The men, soaking in humility as well as water, begin to

           scrub with A SINGLE BAR OF HARSH SOAP passed among them.

                          RADBURN (CONT'D)

           The boy, too. Get him clean.

           Solomon takes some soap and rubs it over Randall.

                          RADBURN (CONT'D)

           Scrub now. Git 'em clean.

           Solomon scrubs harder. Randall - clearly cold and

           uncomfortable - appeals to Solomon.

                          RANDALL

           Do you know when my Mama will

           come?

                          RADBURN

           Hush him up!

           Seeing Solomon has no answer for him, Randall begins to

           cry.

                          RANDALL

           Mama ..! Mama! Is she going to

           come?

           Doing all he can to spare the child from a certain

                          BEATING:

                          SOLOMON

           Quiet, please.

           Randall is becoming nearly inconsolable.

                          RANDALL

           Mama!

           Saying anything to keep the boy quiet:

                          SOLOMON

           Your mother will come, I swear she

           will, but you must be silent.

           Please. Be silent!

           On the seeming strength of Solomon's promise, Randall

           goes silent. Solomon looks to Radburn, who just throws

           water on the soapy men.

          A32 INT. BURCH'S DUNGEON - EVENING A32

           Radburn brings food in to Solomon; a shriveled piece of

           meat and some water. Just barely enough to sustain

           Solomon. Radburn also has a SHIRT.

                          RADBURN

           That old thing of yours is just

           rags and tatters. Need something

           proper to wear.

           Solomon doesn't move for the clothing.

                          RADBURN (CONT'D)

           Go'won. Put it on.

           With slow defiance, Solomon does as instructed. He

           removes what remains of his old shirt - the one he was

           wearing when first kidnapped - and puts on the one

           Radburn brought him. The shirt's ill-fitting and dirty.

           Despite that, Radburn says:

                          RADBURN (CONT'D)

           There. Tha's fine. Tha's fine.

           Got no gratitude?

                          SOLOMON

           ...Thank you...

                          RADBURN

           Yah keep bein' proper, yah'll see

           how things work out.

           Radburn starts to take the old shirt.

                          SOLOMON

           No! It was from my wife.

                          RADBURN

           Rags and tatters. Rags and

           tatters.

           Taking the shirt, the "rags and tatters" as he calls

           them, Radburn exits, locking the door behind him.

           Solomon sits with the plate of food before him. He

           pushes the plate away rather than eat.

           Sitting together out in the yard are Clemens Ray, John

           and Solomon. Over time they have drawn trustworthy

           enough to speak with one another. At the moment Solomon

           is still trying to apply reason to the situation.

           Randall wanders about in the background. As usual, he

           calls out for his "Mama." By now, however, his calls

           should feel like little more than background noise.

                          SOLOMON

           This can't stand. It is a crime.

           I believe now someone lay in wait

           for me. My drink was altered...

           We are free men. They have...they

           have no right to hold us.

           Solomon waits for a response from the others. They give

           none.

                          SOLOMON (CONT'D)

           We need a sympathetic ear. If we

           have an opportunity to explain our

                          SITUATION--

                          CLEMENS

           sympathetic ear?

           The two men I journeyed with. I'm

           certain they're making inquires at

           this very moment.

                          CLEMENS

           I would be just as certain they

           are counting the money paid for

           delivering you to this place.

                          SOLOMON

           They were not kidnappers. They

           were artists. Fellow performers.

                          CLEMENS

           You know that? You know for

           certain who they were?

           The fact is, Solomon can't say for certain.

           How I reckon the situation:

           whatever past we had...well,

           that's done now. The reality to

           come is us being transported

           southward. New Orleans if I were

           to venture. After we arrive,

           we'll be put to market. Beyond

           that... Well, once in a slave

           state I suppose there's only one

           outcome.

           No.

           Mama!

           All three men turn and look. At the moment Randall

           doesn't call out emptily. At the door to the yard is

           Burch along with two women. One in her late twenties;

           ELIZA. She is "arrayed in silk, with rings upon her

           fingers, and golden ornaments suspended from her ears."

           Though a slave, Eliza was a mistress and has - to this

           point - lived well. This is reflected in her airs and

           her speech. The other is a little girl, light in skin

           color, of about seven or eight. This is EMILY, Randall's

           half sister.

           As she enters the yard Eliza squeals with high delight,

           then breaks into tears of both sorrow and joy. Clearly

           this is mother and child being reunited.

           She is overcome with emotion.

                          ELIZA

           My darling. My sweet, sweet baby.

           INT. BURCH'S DUNGEON - EVENING

           Later in the evening. Solomon now shares his space with

           Eliza and her children. As the children rest, Eliza

           drops into a lament as if pleading her case to Solomon

           who lends a sympathetic ear.

           Both slyly, and with a bit of aggrandizement:

                          ELIZA

           When I say I had my master's

           favor, you understand. Above even

           his own wife, I had it. Do you

           know that he built a house for me?

           Built it on the sole condition

           that I reside there with him. The

           added promise in time I would be

           emancipated. And for nine years

           he blessed me with every comfort

           and luxury in life.

           Displaying the finery she still wears:

                          ELIZA (CONT'D)

           Silks and jewels and even servants

           to wait upon us. Such was our

           life, and the life of this

           beautiful girl I bore for him.

           But Master Berry's daughter...she

           always looked at me with an unkind

           nature. She hated Emily no matter

           she and Emily were flesh of flesh.

           As Master Berry's health failed,

           she gained power in the household.

           Eventually, I was brought to the

           city on the false pretense of our

           free papers being executed. If I

           had known what waited; to be sent

           south? I swear I would not have

           come here alive.

           It's the deep of night, all are sleeping. A KEY TURNS IN

           THE LOCK AND THE DOOR OPENS. Burch enters with Radburn

           beside him. Both carry LANTERNS with them. Hardly

           giving Solomon and Eliza a moment to rouse themselves,

                          BURCH DEMANDS:

                          BURCH

           Come on. Get yer blankets. Get

           up.

           Sensing that things will not end well:

                          ELIZA

           No, please don't...

                          BURCH

           I don't want to hear yer talk.

           Get in the yard.

                          ELIZA

           Please...

                          RADBURN

           Ain't no need for all that.

           Putting hand to Randall's head.

                          RADBURN (CONT'D)

           Jus takin' a li'l trip, tha's all.

           Don't want to frighten the

           chil'ren none over a li'l boat

           Eliza gives a shake of her head to the negative.

                          RADBURN (CONT'D)

           Alright then. Git yerselves up.

           We now have Solomon, Clemens, John, Eliza and the

           children. They are being cuffed together. As John is

           cuffed, he pulls back. Scared. He beings in

                          DESPERATION:

                          JOHN

           Not wanting to hear any of this talk, Burch strikes John

           several times in the head with a sap-like instrument.

           Weakened, but again:

                          JOHN (CONT'D)

           John's massa gunna--

           Burch again strikes John until he's quiet. Curiously,

           Emily and Randall don't even flinch. Why would they?

           They are quite used to seeing this kind of violence.

                          BURCH

           Not a word out of none a yah. Not

           a word.

           Burch and Radburn begin driving the shackled slaves from

           The slaves are lead to a flat bed of the horse and

           carriage. They are made to lay down side-by-side. We stay

           with them as some sort of cloth is flung over them,

           obscuring and blacking out their view.

           At that moment, the screen is BLACKENED and we hear the

           sound of the cart moving in haste.

           EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. DOCK - NIGHT

           Led by Burch, the group of slaves arrive to a dock. They

           are taken quickly up a gangplank and onto the steamboat

           ORLEANS as the CAPTAIN, CREW and a MULATTO WOMAN WATCH,

           but do not interfere.

           The slaves are hustled down one at a time into a dark,

           dank hold among barrels and boxes of freight...and RATS.

           Burch comes around and "checks" the chains; makes sure

           they are all secure and locked.

           Satisfied, he heads up out of the hold. Radburn follows.

           Alone in the dark in the hold, John cries, as does Eliza.

           Solomon stares down Burch for as long as he can, as if

           wishing bad things. As if wanting to exact some measure

           of revenge. But the greater insult is that Burch and

           Radburn, engaged in conversation, take no notice of

           Solomon whatsoever. He is that insignificant to them.

           That fact, that reality, makes Solomon boil with a rage

           he cannot express in words.

           Cheer up and don't be so cast

           down.

           Clemens Ray and Solomon watch as the Mulatto Woman

           returns to top deck, the trapdoor locked firmly behind 

           her. Clemens Ray turns to Solomon with a deadpan stern 

           expression. 

                          CLEMENS RAY 

           If you want to survive, do and say 

           as little as possible. Tell no

           Solomon's face is one of a confused despair. 

          43A EXT. NORFOLK/PORT - DAY 43A 

           We see a flat overhead view of the port of Norfolk. 

           Sardines are laid out to dry in rows, glittering in the 

           day's sun as if like silver pennies. A chain of slaves 

           enter the frame and are led one by one on to the docked 

           vessel. 

           MORE SLAVES - about 15 in all, of various genders and 

           ages - are brought on board. Chief among them is ROBERT 

           who fights viciously with his captors. "With all haste" 

           is shoved down into the hold. 

           Having taken their cargo as far as they care or need to, 

           Burch and Radburn depart. They do so without a word 

           spoken to Solomon or the others. 

           With this new and sizable batch of slaves on board, the 

           crew again CASTS OFF, and the Orleans makes its way 

           again.

           Solomon is back cleaning in the galley. As he cleans, he

           again watches Robert prep food. Robert's skill with a

           knife is not lost on Solomon.

          45 INT. HOLD - LATER - DAY 45 

           The hold is packed tighter now. 

           Muzzle covering his face, Robert is shackled with his 

           hands tied behind his back. Solomon and Clemens Ray look 

           on. 

           A sailor descends the staircase and takes off Robert's 

           muzzle, shooting him a forbidding look. He leaves.

           Robert delivers this in a hushed voice. 

                          SOLOMON 

           The crew is fairly small. If it 

           were well planned, I believe 

           they could be strong armed.

           Three can't stand against a whole

           A Sailor descends the ladder approaching Eliza. He bends 

           down and attempts to wake the daughter by caressing her 

           face. 

           Solomon rouses, and looks across to witness the scene. 

           From his vantage point, we see Eliza stand to interrupt 

           the Sailor. The Sailor looks at Eliza, Eliza looks back 

           at him. Knowingly she leads him off into a corner of the 

           hold. 

           As she does so, Eliza passes Robert who jumps up to stand 

           between Eliza and the Sailor. Stretching out a firm hand 

           to the sailor's shoulder, Robert's look says "No you 

           don't." 

           Clemens Ray is awake now, watching. 

           There is an odd moment of stillness between the Sailor 

           and Robert, an impasse. 

           We focus on the Sailor's face. Slowly, a greasy smile 

           erupts upon it. Back now to Robert's face, a look of 

           incomprehension. 

           Robert looks down. We follow his gaze to the knife that 

           has already been jabbed unseen between Robert's ribs. 

           The sailor withdraws the bloody blade. 

           A wide shot of the two men. Robert collapses to the 

           floor like a sack of potatoes.

           Clemens...! Clemens Ray!

           We are in the port of New Orleans, one of the busiest in

           the young nation.

           On the dock itself there is a bustle of activity as goods

           are loaded and unloaded from a various ships. It's a bit

           of controlled chaos as a VARIETY OF LANGUAGES are spoken

           and shouted while slaves are shuttled from the Orleans to

           a holding pen. Solomon, and all the slaves are

           overwhelmed by all that is happening around them.

           Two men - among many - are awaiting the arrival of the

           Orleans. They are JONUS RAY - Clemens Ray's master - and

           DAVIS who is the solicitor of Mr. Ray. They both look

           like they mean business. The moment the gangplank is

           laid, Ray yells for Clemens.

           Clemens, seeing his master, is nearly crazy with delight.

           He is, uncharacteristically beside himself. Ironically,

           his master now represents "freedom."

           Clemens pulls on his chain. As he does so, Several other

           slaves collapse in his effort to reach his master, like

           dominos.

           Who is in charge of this vessel?

           I am the Captain.

                          RAY

           I am Mr. Jonus Ray. My solicitor

           has documentation verifying that

           the Negro named Clemens Ray is my

           property.

           As he reads PAPERS handed to him by Davis:

                          CAPTAIN

           I know nothing of--

                          RAY

           You are ordered by court to return

           that property immediately, or face

           charges of thievery.

                          CAPTAIN

           My duty is to transport goods. I

           am not responsible for their

           origin.

           To his mate:

                          CAPTAIN

           Free him!

           Biddee does as ordered. Once free, Clemens hugs and sobs

           over his master as would a lost and then found child.

                          RAY

           It's all well, now, Clemens. You

           will return home with me.

           (to the Captain)

           Consider this notice and warning.

           Ray, Davis and Clemens head away. Solomon seems both

           desperate and hopeful of some aid from Clemens and Ray.

           But there is none forthcoming. Ray and Clemens continue

           on - Clemens not so much as even looking back in

           Solomon's direction. Solomon stands and watches as they

           fade into the environs and are gone from sight.

           EXT. NEW ORLEANS/PORT - LATER

           Hours later. The slaves sit off on one side of the dock,

           baking in the sun, awaiting their fate.

           THEOPHILUS FREEMAN - a tall, thin-faced man with light

           complexion and a little bent - moves along the deck

           calling out names from a list. The slaves STAND as they

           are called.

                          FREEMAN

           Oren. John. Lethe. Eliza.

           Randall. Emily. Platt... Platt!

           Solomon does not respond. Freeman looks around. He

           spots Solomon.

                          FREEMAN (CONT'D)

           Captain, who shipped that nigger?

                          CAPTAIN

           Burch.

           Freeman steps to Solomon. He gives him a looking over.

                          FREEMAN

           Stand up.

           Solomon does as told.

                          FREEMAN (CONT'D)

           You fit the description given.

           Why didn't you answer when called?

                          SOLOMON

           My name is not Platt. My name is--

           Freeman strikes Solomon hard across the face.

                          FREEMAN

           Your name is Platt, and I will

           teach you your name so that you

           don't forget.

           (to the Captain)

           Shackle my niggers. Get them to

           my cart.

          36.

          54 I/E. CART - LATER 54

           Solomon is carted off along with the rest of "Burch's

           stock:" Eliza and her children, John and Solomon.

           As they move off from the port in a make-shift cart, it

           opens up to the frenzic, busy port.

           For the first time Solomon sees true and severe slavery.

           These are not visiting servants, such as Jasper was back

           in Saratoga. These are humans held in strict bondage -

           herded like cattle, chained together as if in a "chain

           gang." Slaves are evident not merely by the color of

           their skin. The residue and accessories of slavery are

           everywhere. Blacks almost universally display scars -

           THICK AND HEAVY DEAD TISSUE FROM LACERATIONS LEFT

           UNTREATED - brands, and are often missing limbs. Blacks

           are held in all types of shackles, from simple chains to

           elaborate bindings, to neck collars that are spiked.

           Some are muzzled or forced to wear bits. One slave is

           attacked by a dog and the slave owner. The dog pulls and

           tears at the slave's clothes. THESE IMAGES SHOULD BE A

           CONSTANT AND CONTINUAL CANVAS TO THE PIECE. EVER

           PRESENT, BUT NOT REALLY COMMENTED ON AS THEY ARE THE

           NORM. They should be a reminder that not only are people

           being oppressed, but that there is an entire system of

           oppression in place.

                         55 55

           EXT. FREEMAN'S SLAVE PEN - LATER

           "Burch's stock:" arrive at Freeman's slave pen. They are

           led in by Freeman and his house slave CAPE - a mulatto.

           The yard is enclosed by plank, standing upright, with

           ends sharpened instead of brick walls as with Burch's.

           Including Burch's group there are about 30 SLAVES in the

           pen.

           Solomon and the others look around and see nothing but

           downtrodden and despondent faces. Three men sit next to

           each other with muzzles and quietly stare back at this

           new batch of arrivals. One attempts to speak, but all

           that comes out is a muffled, unintelligible sound.

                         56 56

           EXT. FREEMAN'S SLAVE PEN - LATER

           The slaves are in various states of undress, men and

           women alike. They clean themselves, scrubbing with soap

           and water. Women wash their hair. Men shave, skin is

           oiled. Freeman walks among them, inspecting them as they

           primp themselves.

                         57 57

           INT. FREEMAN'S SLAVE PEN - LATER

           The slaves are given new clothes by Cape. The men are

           given hat, coat, shirt, pants and shoes. The women

                         57 CONTINUED: 57

           frocks of calico and handkerchiefs to bind about their

           heads.

          58 INT. FREEMAN'S/GREAT ROOM - LATER 58

           It's an odd, ironic scene. The slaves are in a large and

           fairly ornate room within Freeman's house. CAPE PLAYS A

           PAINFUL TUNE ON A FIDDLE - background music - as Freeman

           tries to line up A SMALL GROUP OF THE SLAVES, he becomes

           less patient, jittery and nervous, knowing that his

           livelihood is at stake, he wants his slaves to make a

           good impression. Sometimes his patience gets the better

           of him, and his hands move freely in direction of the

           slaves.

           The business has the air of an etiquette class, though

           what Freeman is trying to do is coach the slaves into

           being more "sellable." He works with them in groups of

           five or so.

                          FREEMAN

           Tallest to smallest, understand?

           Are you taller than her? Then

           you'd go before her. Do it.

           Move.

           (to the group)

           Keep your heads up. A sense of

           direction; that's how you look

           smart. None of those saucer eyes.

           Rid yourself of that smile. Look

           like a goddamn grinnin' monkey.

           Put the least thought in your

           head. C'mon, now. Think of

           somethin'.

           Weary of Cape's playing, Solomon moves to Cape. He asks:

                          SOLOMON

           Can you play a reel?

                          CAPE

                          (DISMISSIVE)

           Nah. I don't know no reel.

                          SOLOMON

           If I may...?

           Cape looks to Freeman:

                          FREEMAN

           He sick of your caterwaulin'. Let

           him play, boy. Let's see what he

           can do.

           Cape reluctantly hands the fiddle over to Solomon.

           Solomon tunes it a bit, then begins to play. His fingers

           stiff at first, he takes a moment to warm up. But as he

           warms up he is, despite the circumstances, masterful.

                          (CONTINUED)

                         58 CONTINUED: 58

           THE SLAVES ALL CLAP ALONG. SOME DANCE ALONG. All admire

           his work. Freeman chief among them.

                          FREEMAN (CONT'D)

           Keep on. Keep on.

           Solomon continues to play.

                          FREEMAN (CONT'D)

           A damn sight better than you,

           Cape. A damn sight better.

           Cape looks bitter as Solomon plays on.

           INT. FREEMAN'S/GREAT ROOM - DAY

           We come in on an odd sort of sight; A JUMBLE OF ACTIVITY.

           CUSTOMERS have come to see Freeman's lot - the room all

           gussied up with flowers. Freeman moves among them,

           displaying them as a rancher would prize chattel.

           Freeman makes the slaves hold their heads up - "look

           smart" as he previously admonished them. They are made

           to walk briskly back and forth while customers feel their

           hands and arms and bodies, turn them about and ask what

           skills they possess. The Customers routinely make the

           slaves open their mouths and show their teeth.

           At times a MALE or FEMALE SLAVE are taken off to the

           side, stripped and inspected more minutely.

           One of them, John, is stripped and inspected.

           Cape, as he's done previously, plays his fiddle.

           A buyer - WILLIAM FORD; a man of middle age, and an

           attractive nature in his tone of voice - consults a list

           he's drawn up and asks of Freeman:

                          FORD

           What is the price for the ones

           Platt and Eliza?

                          FREEMAN

           A thousand for Platt; he is a

           nigger of talent. Seven hundred

           for Eliza. My fairest price.

                          FORD

           You will accept a note?

                          FREEMAN

           As always, from you, Mr. Ford.

           Eliza is beside herself as it seems she is about to be

           separated from her family. She begs of Ford:

                          (CONTINUED)

          39.

                         59 CONTINUED: 59

                          ELIZA

           Please, sir... Please don't

           divide my family. Don't take me

           unless you take my children as

           well.

                          FREEMAN

           Eliza, quiet!

                          ELIZA

           You will have the most faithful

           slave in me, sir. The most

           faithful slave that has ever

           lived, but I beg that you do not

           separate us.

           A BUYER interrupts the skirmish and approaches Freeman

           and delivers coolly, eyeing Randall-

                          BUYER

           Your price for the child?

                          FREEMAN

           You see how fit the boy is. Like

           ripe fruit. He will grow into a

           fine beast.

           Randall is made to run, and jump by FREEMAN - exhibiting

           his activity and his condition.

                          FREEMAN (CONT'D)

           Six hundred, and that's fair and

           final.

                          BUYER

           Done.

           He reaches into his waistcoat and retrieves his wallet,

           counting out six hundred dollars, placing them into the

           already extended hand of Freeman.

           Ford sees the distress and panic in Eliza; it visibly

           touches him. He now tries to buy EMILY to console her.

                          FORD

           How much for the little girl? You

           have no need for her. One so

           young will bring you no profit.

                          FREEMAN

           I will not sell the girl. There's

           heaps 'n piles of money to be made

           off her. She is a beauty. One of

           the regular bloods. None of your

           thick-lipped, bullet headed,

           cotton picking niggers.

           Her child, man. For God's sake,

           are you not sentimental in the

           least?

                          FREEMAN

           My sentimentality stretches the

           length of a coin. Do you want the

           lot, Mr. Ford, or do you pass on

           them all?

                          FORD

           I will take the ones Platt and

           Eliza.

           Eliza grips her children tight.

                          ELIZA

           I will not go without my children.

           You will not take them from me.

           As if to prove her wrong, Freeman puts a foot to Eliza

           and harshly kicks her away from Emily.

                          ELIZA (CONT'D)

           Please, don't. No!

           Freeman, to Cape:

                          FREEMAN

           Take her out of here.

           Cape DROPS HIS FIDDLE, begins to pull Eliza away toward

           the door of the room, but her screaming and pleading do

           not abate. IT IS CLEARLY UNSETTLING TO THE OTHER BUYERS.

                          FREEMAN (CONT'D)

           Keep her quiet.

           Cape tries to muzzle her with his hand, but Eliza

           continues to scream for her children as Emily does for

           her mother.

                          EMILY

           Mama... Mama!

                          FREEMAN

                          (TO SOLOMON)

           Play something! Get the fiddle

           and play.

           As ordered, Solomon takes up Cape's fiddle and begins to

           play lightly.

                          FREEMAN (CONT'D)

           Play!

           Solomon plays harder and more loudly. Still, it is

           barely enough to drown out Eliza's cries. Freeman gets

           the other slaves to clap along with Solomon's playing.

           Emily frees herself and runs back, crying but endeavoring

           to be strong-

                          EMILY

           Don't cry, Mama. I will be a good

           girl. Don't cry. I will keep my

           head up and I will look smart. I

           will always look smart.

                          FREEMAN

           Make merry, all of you! Goddamn

           it, Cape! Keep her quiet or it's

           your damned hide I will take it

           out of!

           Cape pulls a rag, stuffs it in Eliza's mouth. Clamping

           both hands over her mouth, he hauls Eliza from the room

           by the head. IT IS AN UGLY, UGLY SCENE.

          60 EXT. FORD PLANTATION - LATER 60

           Driven in a horse drawn wagon by Ford are Solomon and

           Eliza. Eliza is sullen to say the least. With the loss

           of her two children she has dropped into a depression she

           will not be able to pull out of.

           They arrive to the FORD PLANTATION. The main house of

           the plantation - the GREAT HOUSE as they are commonly

           called - is sizable. Two stories high with a piazza in

           front. In the rear are also a log kitchen, poultry

           house, corncribs and several slave cabins. The

           plantation is described as "a green spot in the

           wilderness."

           With the arrival of Master Ford there is a flurry of

           activity - the "excitement" of a new delivery. MR.

           CHAPIN, a white overseer, instructs a slave named SAM.

                          CHAPIN

           Sam, call to the Mistress.

                          SAM

           Mistress! Mistress, they arrivn'.

           MISTRESS FORD EXITS the house - along with her attending

           slave, RACHEL, who is a cook AS WELL AS SAM'S WIFE - and

           travels to her husband, kisses him, then laughingly

                          INQUIRES:

           MRS. FORD

           Did you bring all those niggers?

           your children will soon enough be

           forgotten.

           John Tibeats, stands before the slaves. Chapin hovers to 

           one side. 

                          TIBEATS 

           My name is John Tibeats, William 

           Ford's chief carpenter. You will 

           refer to me as Master. 

           Tibeats nods in Chapin's direction: 

                          TIBEATS (CONT'D) 

           Mister Chapin is the overseer on 

           this plantation. He is 

           responsible for all of Ford's 

           property. You too will refer to 

           him as Master. 

           This plantation covers many 

           hundreds of acres, and you will 

           traverse the Texas road between 

           the forest site and the sawmill in 

           double time. Any clever nigger on 

           that path that gets a little 

           lightfooted, I will remind him 

           that on one side men and 

           bloodhounds patrol the border and 

           on the other the bayou provides a 

           hard living, with alligators and 

           little to eat or drink that won't 

           kill you. No slave has escaped 

           here with his life. You're here 

           to work niggers, so let's 

           commence. 

           Tibeats begins to sing the song "Run Nigger, Run" 

           mockingly. 

           We cut to Solomon chopping logs and into the montage of 

           the slaves doing manual labor and arriving back to the 

           sawmill. 

           Lyrics for "Run Nigger, Run"

          61 EXT. WOODS - DAY 61

           -END OF MAY THROUGH EARLY JUNE, 1841-

           We are in a wooded area. There is A GANG OF SLAVES

           chopping trees into timber. It is hard, laborious work

           made no more easy by the sweltering heat. Solomon is

           among them as well as Sam.

                         62 62

           EXT. WOODS - LATER

           The slaves now load the timber onto a horse drawn wagon.

           Again, hard work done under the ever present sun.

          42B.

          63 EXT. ROAD - LATER 63

           As Sam drives the wagon, the other slaves trudge along

           side by foot. We should get the sense the travel is long

           and tedious.

          64 EXT. FORD'S WORK AREA - LATER 64

           It is a sizable work area on the edge of Indian Creek.

           There is much work being done, the slaves primarily

           employed in piling the timber and chopping it into

           lumber. As before, there is little doubt about the

           rigors of the job at hand.

           Working as a carpenter at the work area is JOHN TIBEATS.

           There are also various CUSTOMERS who move about placing

           orders.

           EXT. FORD PLANTATION - DAY

           -EARLY TO MID JUNE, 1841-

           It's Sunday morning. All of Ford's slaves are dressed

           with their "finest" clothes - brightly colored and as

           free as possible of defect. The slaves are gathered on

                          (CONTINUED)

                         65 CONTINUED: 65

           the lawn just beyond the piazza. Mistress Ford is

           present as well. As the slaves listen, Ford reads to

           them Scripture. His tone is of a man trying to preach by

           way of compassion.

                          FORD

           "But as touching the resurrection

           of the dead, have ye not read that

           which was spoken unto you by God,

           saying, I am the God of Abraham,

           and the God of Isaac, and the God

           of Jacob. God is not the God of

           the dead, but of the living. And

           when the multitude heard this,

           they were astonished at his

           doctrine. Then one of them, which

           was a lawyer, asked him a

           question, tempting him, and

           saying, Master, which is the

           great commandment in the law?

           Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt

           love the Lord thy God with all thy

           heart, and with all thy soul, and

           with all thy mind. This is the

           first and great commandment. And

           the second is like unto it, thou

           shalt love thy neighbor as

           thyself. On these two

           commandments hang all the law and

           the prophets."

           Despite the lightness with which Ford speaks and the hope

           in his words, ELIZA SITS OFF TO THE SIDE - SELF-SECLUDED

           A BIT - WEEPING GENTLY.

           We should be able to see in Mistress Ford's eyes that

           Eliza's constant crying is unsettling.

           The slaves have broken for lunch. They snack on smoked

           meat and drink water from gourds. As they lunch Solomon

           reads from Sam's Bible to the other slaves.

                          SOLOMON

           But he that is greatest among you,

           let him be as the younger; and he

           that is chief, as he that doth

           serve. For whether is greater, he

           that sitteth at meat, or he that

           serveth? Is not he that sitteth

           at meat? But I am among you as he

           that serveth.

           A white customer - WINSLOW - irate at the sight and sound

           of slaves reading Scripture, crosses over. He grabs the

           Bible.

                          WINSLOW

           From where did you thieve this?

                          SAM

           Suh, the book is my property.

           The White Customer has no interest in Sam's answer. With

           flailing hands he STARTS BEATING ON SAM. Solomon tries

           to stop him. That only makes the situation worse,

           Solomon now the target of the man's ire.

                          WINSLOW

           Take your hands from me!

           Ford comes running over.

                          FORD

           What is the commotion?

                          WINSLOW

           Your niggers are either brazen or

           rebellious. This one was readin'

           Scripture, and this one claims it

           to be his.

                          FORD

           It is. A gift from his Mistress.

                          WINSLOW

           You condone this?

                          FORD

           I encourage it. As a Christian I

           can do no less.

           You can do no worse, Ford. A

           slave that reads is dangerous.

           Winslow moves off. He yells back at Ford:

                          WINSLOW (CONT'D)

           And the man who would allow a

           slave to read is unfit to own

           niggers!

           Handing the Bible back to Sam, very matter of factly:

                          FORD

           Pay him no mind. The word of God

           applies to all. In that you may

           take comfort.

           Sam is at the reigns of the wagon carrying the timber to

           Ford's WORK AREA. Slaves trudge alongside, same as it

           ever was. Only...it's not quite the same. Sam brings

           the wagon to a halt. He, and the slaves look up the road

           ahead of them.

           Standing in the middle of the road is a group of

           CHICKASAWS INDIANS. They are in their "usual" dress of

           buckskin breeches and calico hunting shirts of fantastic

           colors, buttoned from belt to chin. They have with them

           DOGS and HORSES. They carry with them the carcass of a

           deer.

           The two groups stare at each other for a long moment.

           EXT. FIELD - DUSK/END OF DAY

           The groups of slaves and Chickasaws are now intermingled.

           They "break bread" - actually they work on the carcass of

           the deer which is now roasting over a large fire. As

           well the group share a smoke on a pipe.

           One of the Chickasaws is playing a tune on an "INDIAN

           FIDDLE." The Chickasaws perform a customary dance;

           trotting after each other, and giving utterance to a

           guttural, sing-song noise.

           The slaves enjoy the respite from work, Solomon

           particularly taken by the music...if not entirely

           enthralled by it.

           group.

          74 EXT. RIVER BANK - CONTINUOUS 74

           Solomon arrives to some tall grass at the edge of the

           river. Lowering his trousers, SOLOMON SQUATS TO

           DEFECATE. As he does, he stares out toward the flowing

           waters of Indian Creek. After a few moments, as though a

           thought far greater than relieving himself has come to

           him, Solomon stands and replaces his pants.

           Oddly, Solomon stares out at the water as though he were

           a man possessed.

           EXT. FORD'S WORK AREA - DAY

           Just beyond the WORK AREA Solomon speaks with Ford as

           Tibeats listens. Solomon is drawing in the dirt, making

           rough diagrams for Ford as he explains himself.

                          SOLOMON

           The creek is plenty deep enough to

           sail, even with a boat full of

           load. The distance from the WORK

           AREA to the point on the latter

           bayou is several miles by water

           fewer than land. It occurs to me

           that the expense of the

           transportation would be materially

                          DIMINISHED--

                          TIBEATS

           "Materially diminished?"

                          SOLOMON

           If we use the waterway.

                          TIBEATS

           It's a scheme. Plenty of

           engineers have schemed similarly.

           The passes are too tight.

                          SOLOMON

           I reckon them at more than twelve

           feet at their most narrow. Wide

           enough for a tub to traverse. A

           team of niggers can clear it out.

                          TIBEATS

           William Van Nortwick was

           superintendent. With my earnings

           I hired several efficient hands to

           assist me, and I entered into

           WE HAVE A SERIES OF SCENES in which we see Solomon and a

           TEAM OF BLACKS working on the creek: CHOPPING TREES

           ALONG THE BANKS, widening out the shore... It's all just

           a trial for now. The work is diligent, but it is basic

           to this point. Still, under Solomon's direction, the

           slaves go at it like they've got something to prove. And

           rightly they do.

           Solomon also works on a narrow raft of twelve cribs with

           which he will transport the timber.

           Once this is constructed, HE PERSONALLY "SAILS" THEM UP

           THE CREEK WITH A TEST LOAD.

           Ford and a group of slaves wait along the river banks

           just beyond the WORK AREA. All are expectant in their

           manner. A long moment passes with no sign of Solomon.

           Then, from up river, we see Solomon's raft of lumber

           winding its way. SLAVES CHEER, and Ford literally

           applauds the effort. Tibeats looks pissed. He has just

           been shown up after all.

           As we come into the scene, Ford is presenting Solomon

           with a fiddle. Not as grand as the one he previously

           owned in New York, but a fine instrument none the less.

           It is a gift of thanks for his hard work. Solomon's

           gratitude is easily expressed.

           My thanks to you, and it is the

           least of it. My hope is that it

           brings us both much joy over the

           years.

           Following the statement, Solomon's not sure how to react.

           He remains grateful, but the thought of "over the years"

           is just a reminder of the altered state in which he now

           finds himself.

           The slaves eat. All tired from a days work they conduct

           themselves in silence. All except for Eliza who,

           SLIPPING INTO PERMANENT DEPRESSION, as always weeps. The

           sound of her sobbing edging him up - particularly after

           Master Ford's "over the years" observation. Solomon

                          FINALLY SNAPS:

           Eliza. Eliza, stop!

           Solomon goes to her, grabs Eliza. She does not stop. As

           if to force the misery from her, Solomon SHAKES ELIZA

           Master Ford is a decent man.

                          ELIZA

           He is a slaver.

                          SOLOMON

           I survive. I will not fall into

           despair. Woeful and crushed;

           melancholy is the yolk I see most.

           I will offer up my talents to

           Master Ford. I will keep myself

           hearty until freedom is opportune.

                          ELIZA

           Ford is your opportunity. Do you

           think he does not know that you

           are more than you suggest? But he

           does nothing for you. Nothing.

           Eliza uses Solomon's name quite pointedly as if to

           underscore his true self. Solomon get her meaning. Yet

           he says nothing. Again, pointedly:

           At the same time came the

           disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who

           -AUGUST, 1841-

           It's Sunday. The slaves are again gathered in the rose

           garden near the front of the house to hear the word of

           the Lord as read by Master Ford.

                          FORD

           And Jesus called a little child

           unto him, and set him in the midst

           of them, And said, Verily I say

           unto you, Except ye be converted,

           and become as little children, ye

           shall not enter into the kingdom

           of heaven.

           The phrase seems to trigger Eliza's tears. She begins to

           sob uncontrollably.

           Mrs. Ford turns to Rachel in a hushed whisper-

           MRS. FORD

           I cannot have that kind of

           depression about.

           Solomon, pretending not to have heard, slowly turns to

           Eliza with worry.

           Ford continues to preach over Eliza's keening.

           -JANUARY, 1842-

           Seasons have passed. It is winter now, and very grey out

           along the bayou. Ford and Tibeats - who we have seen

           working around the WORK AREA - stand with Solomon,

           Tibeats giving Solomon an inspection. Ford carries much

           lament.

                          TIBEATS

           Raise yer shirt.

           Solomon does as instructed. Tibeats looks at Solomon's

           back, at the scars from lashings he bears.

                          TIBEATS (CONT'D)

           Troublesome.

                          FORD

           He's a good carpenter and quick-

           witted.

                          TIBEATS

           I am familiar with his cleverness.

                          FORD

           You won't find a nigger more

           humble.

                          TIBEATS

           Ain't found a nigger yet I cain't

           humble.

           Tibeats heads off. Solomon, highly curious over the

           preceding.

                          SOLOMON

           Sir, have I done something wrong?

                          FORD

           Not your concern, Platt. I say

           with much...shame I have compiled

           debts. I have long preached

           austerity, but find myself

           hypocritical in that regard.

           You'll be in the ownership of Mr.

           EXT. FORD PLANATION - DAY

           -END OF JANUARY, 1842- [OVER ONE DAY]

           We see Solomon working as a carpenter, helping to erect a

           Weaving House that stands off to the side of the

           plantation's Great House.

           At the moment Solomon is nailing on siding. Tibeats

           arrives and is immediately dissatisfied with the work.

                          TIBEATS

           Make them boards flush.

                          SOLOMON

           They are, sir.

                          TIBEATS

           They is no such thing.

           Solomon runs his hands over the boards.

                          SOLOMON

           As smooth to the touch as a

           yearling's coat.

                          TIBEATS

           Callin' me a liar, boy?

                          SOLOMON

           Only a matter of perspective, sir.

           From where you stand you may see

           differently. But the hands are

           not mistaken. I ask only that you

           employ all your senses before

           rendering judgement.

           What's Tibeats to do when faced with fact? All he can do

           is spew invectives.

                          TIBEATS

           You are a brute. You are a dog,

           and no better for followin'

           instruction.

                          SOLOMON

           I'll do as ordered, sir.

                          TIBEATS

           Then you'll be up at daybreak.

           You will procure a keg of nails

           from Chapin and commence puttin'

           on clapboards.

           Tibeats wheels away. Solomon goes back to his work.

           After a few moments Solomon notices a bit of commotion in

           the drive of the great house. It involves an

           inconsolable Eliza who is being herded by Sam onto a cart

           DRIVEN BY A WHITE MAN. Mistress Ford and Rachel watch.

           Solomon can only watch as the last connection to his days

           as a free man is driven away to a location unknown.

                         83 83

           EXT. WEAVING HOUSE - MORNING

           It is day break. As ordered, Solomon is up and working.

           Chapin is rolling a keg of nails off a handcart for

           Solomon.

                          CHAPIN

           If Tibeats prefers a different

           size, I will endeavor to furnish

           them, but you may use those until

           further directed.

                          SOLOMON

           Yes, sir.

                         84 84

           EXT. WEAVING HOUSE - LATER

           As the day gets on to mid-morning, the sun already baking

           in the sky, Tibeats makes his way over to Solomon. Even

           before arriving to Solomon his mien is one of

           belligerence; out of sorts and something less than sober.

                          TIBEATS

           I thought I told yah ta commence

           ta puttin' on clapboards this

           morn'.

           Yes, master. I am about it. I

           have begun on the other side of

           the house.

           Tibeats walks around to look over Solomon's work. He is

           picayune, as if purposefully looking for fault.

                          TIBEATS

           Didn't I tell yah last night to

           get a keg of nails of Chapin?

                          SOLOMON

           And so I did; and Chapin said he

           would get another size for you, if

           you wanted them when he came back

           from the field.

           Tibeats walks to the keg and kicks it. Moving toward

           Solomon "with a great passion:"

                          TIBEATS

           Goddamn yah! I thought yah knowed

           somethin'!

           Solomon, perhaps inspired by his moment with Eliza, is in

           no mood for Tibeats.

                          SOLOMON

           I did as instructed. If there's

           something wrong, then its wrong

           with your instructions.

                          TIBEATS

           Yah black bastard! Yah goddman

           black bastard!

           In an inconsolable rage, Tibeats runs off to the piazza

           to fetch a whip.

           Solomon looks around. He is alone other than Rachel and

           Mistress Ford who, shocked by that which she witnesses,

           runs out to the field to fetch Chapin. Solomon's

           instinct is to run, but he stands his ground as Tibeats

           marches back whip in hand.

                          TIBEATS (CONT'D)

           Strip yer clothes!

           Solomon does no such thing.

                          TIBEATS (CONT'D)

           Strip!

                          SOLOMON

           I will not.

           With "concentrated vengeance," Tibeats springs for

           Solomon, seizing him by the throat with one hand and

                          (CONTINUED)

          55.

                         84 CONTINUED: (2) 84

           raising the whip with the other. Before he can strike

           the blow, however, Solomon catches Tibeats by the collar

           of his coat and pulls him in close. Reaching down,

           Solomon grabs Tibeats by the ankle and pushes him back

           with the other hand. Tibeats tumbles to the ground. A

           violent struggle takes place as Solomon puts a foot to

           Tibeats throat, and then in a frenzy of madness snatches

           the whip from Tibeats and begins to strike him with the

           handle again and again and again.

                          TIBEATS

           Yew will not live ta see another

           day, nigger! This is yer last, I

           swear it!

           Solomon ignores the threats, continues to beat Tibeats.

           Blow after blow falling fast and heavy on Tibeats's

           wriggling form. The stiff stock of the whip wraps around

           Tibeats's cringing body until Solomon's arm aches.

           Tibeats's cries of vengeance turn to yelps for help and

           then pleas for mercy:

                          TIBEATS (CONT'D)

           Murder! It's murder! Lord, God,

           help me. God be merciful!

           And then suddenly, Tibeats shrieks-

                          TIBEATS (CONT'D)

           Papa I'm sorry!

           Chapin comes RIDING IN FROM THE FIELD fast and hard.

           Solomon strikes Tibeats a blow or two more, then delivers

           a well-directed kick that sends Tibeats rolling over the

           ground.

                          CHAPIN

           What is the matter?

           Tibeats struggles up and tries to present an air of

           dignity and control while he keeps a demonic eye on

                          SOLOMON:

                          SOLOMON

           Master Tibeats wants to whip me

           for using the nails you gave me.

                          CHAPIN

           What's the matter with the nails?

           With a mix of shame, anger and embarrassment, Tibeats

           says, as if being exposed-

                          TIBEATS

           They're...they're too large.

                          CHAPIN

           I am overseer here. I told Platt

           to use them, and

           I shall furnish such nails as I

           please. Do you understand that,

           Mr. Tibeats?

           Tibeats answer is in the grinding of his teeth and the

           shaking of his fist.

                          TIBEATS

           This ain't done by half. I will

           have flesh, and I will have all of

           it.

           Tibeats moves off toward, and then INTO THE HOUSE.

           Chapin follows. A long moment, Solomon stands alone. He

           looks around, not sure what to do; to stay or to flee.

           Anxiety mounts on his features.

           A moment more, and Tibeats EXITS the house. He saddles

           his horse and rides off to beat the devil. Or, worse, to

           fetch him.

           Chapin comes running back out of the house. He is

           visibly excited, and when he speaks he is quite earnest.

           Though he tries to project reasoned emotions he gives off

           an air of impending trouble.

                          CHAPIN

           Do not stir. Do not attempt to

           leave the plantation on any

           account whatever. But if you run

           there is no protecting you.

                          SOLOMON

                          SIR--

                          CHAPIN

           If you run, Platt, there is no

           protecting you. Rachel...!

           Chapin runs off to join Rachel. The two converse at a

           distance from Solomon, then they head off for the log

           kitchen.

           Solomon is now very much alone, and he waits for what is

           to come. AND WE WAIT WITH HIM. And we wait, and we

           continue to wait... Moment by moment, the dread of the

           unexpected mounts.

           Solomon's eyes begin to well. He has beaten a white man,

           and he knows that death awaits him.

           A SLIGHT PRAYER TO THE HEAVENS BEGINS TO FORM IN HIS

           THROAT, but he is too choked up to fully speak it.

                          (CONTINUED)

          57.

                         84 CONTINUED: (4) 84

           Chapin has now returned to the piazza. He stands and

           watches, but does not move to Solomon.

           Solomon waits, and waits...

           WE HEAR THE SOUND OF DISTANT HOOFS which grow louder and

           louder in the manner of rolling thunder. It's Tibeats.

           He returns with two accomplices; RAMSAY and COOK. They

           carry with them large whips and a coil of rope.

                          TIBEATS

           Tha's the one. Tha's him.

           Dismounting, they move with menace that is tinged with

           perverse pleasure and wordless malevolence. Solomon

           tries to fight back, but he is strong armed and tied by

           TIBEATS - his wrists, and then ankles bound in the same

           manner. In the meantime the other two have slipped a

           cord within Solomon's elbows, running it across his back

           and tying it firmly. Solomon is then dragged toward a

           peach tree. A lynching is in store. The naked horror of

           it intensely palpable.

           Solomon looks toward the piazza, but Chapin is now gone.

           Tears of fear flow down Solomon's cheeks. He is on the

           verge of panic; a man heading toward his own execution,

           he begins to struggle and fight.

           A rope goes around Solomon's neck, then is tossed over

           the branch of the tree. The trio begin to hoist Solomon.

           He gasps and gags as spittle flies from his mouth and the

           life is choked from him.

           With suddenness, Chapin comes from the house brandishing

           a pistol in each hand - Colt Paterson .36 caliber

           "Holster" pistols with 9" barrels. Chapin moves with

           determination toward the lynch mob. He is sharp and

           matter of fact. With the guns in hand, he really doesn't

           need to be much more demonstrative.

                          CHAPIN

           Gentlemen... Whoever moves that

           nigger another foot from where he

           stands is a dead man. I am

           overseer of this plantation seven

           years, and in the absence of

           William Ford, my duty is to

           protect his interests. Ford holds

           a mortgage on Platt of four

           hundred dollars. If you hang him,

           he loses his debt. Until that is

           canceled you have no claim to his

           life.

           Directing his attention to Ramsay and Cook:

           As for you two, if you have any

           regard for your own safety...I

           say, begone!

           Ramsay and Cook don't need to be told twice. The pistols

           Chapin's gripping make the situation real clear. Without

           further word, they mount their horses and ride away.

           Tibeats remains, and his anger with him.

                          TIBEATS

           Yah got no cause. Platt is mine,

           and mine ta do with as I please.

           Yah touch my property, I will 'ave

           yah strung up as well.

           Tibeats mounts up and departs. There is a surreal moment

           as Chapin's not sure what to do about Solomon. He

           chooses to do nothing. Solomon is left dangling by the

           neck from the tree as Chapin calls to Sam in the

                          DISTANCE:

                          CHAPIN

           Sam! Get the mule. You must ride

           to Master Ford. Tell him to come

           here at once without a single

           moment's delay. Tell him they are

           trying to murder Platt. Hurry,

           boy. Bring him back if you must

           kill the mule to do so!

                          SAM

           Yes, suh!

           Sam mounts up and rides off, the mule demonstrating much

           speed.

           EXT. FORD PLANATION - LATER

           HOURS HAVE PASSED. The sun is now at its apex. The sight

           and smell of the red rose bush is more than vivid as

           Solomon remains tied and dangling exactly where he was

           left. The scene is both tranquil and horrific. Life on

           the plantation continues. The OTHER SLAVES work in the

           field. CHILDREN make their way playfully in the yard.

           It should all underscore the fact that a black, hanging

           even partially from a tree, is nothing unusual in this

           time and space.

          59.

                         85 CONTINUED: 85

           Chapin walks back and forth with the pistols in his

           hands. Clearly he fears Tibeats returning with more and

           better assistance. And yet, he does nothing to alleviate

           Solomon's suffering. He heeds Tibeats words, and as

           though caught up in the middle of nothing more than a

           property dispute, he offers no further aid.

           Solomon's head lolls to one side. He looks toward the

           sun. The bright light flares off the leaves and branches

           of the tree from which Solomon hangs. The glare in

           Solomon's eyes offering him more pain than solace, but he

           cannot help but look upward. As he does, his eyes

           flutter between life and lifelessness...

           Solomon continues to hang. By now he is drenched in

           sweat, and nearly delirious with dehydration. His lips

           dry and parched. He may not die from hanging, but he may

           very well expire before the day is over.

           Eventually Rachel comes over - timidly, and as though she

           were acting contrary to orders - and offers a drink of

           water from a tin cup, pouring it in Solomon's mouth for

           him. She then takes a small hand towel and dabs at the

           water which clings to his lips. Rachel then retreats,

           and leaves Solomon to hang.

           EXT. FORD PLANATION - EVENING

           The sun is just now arching for the horizon. Solomon

           remains, as though his torture will not end. Ford,

           trailed by Sam, finally comes riding up. He dismounts,

           and moves swiftly over to Solomon. With great heartache:

                          FORD

           Platt... My poor Platt.

           Ford produces a blade and cuts Solomon loose. Solomon

           attempts to carry himself, but he cannot. He falls to

           the ground and passes out.

           INT. FORD PLANATION/GREAT HOUSE - NIGHT

           As we come into the scene, Solomon lays on a blanket on

           the floor. Eventually, his eyes flutter, then open. He

           is in the foyer of the Ford house. As he gets his

           bearings, he looks around the interior. THE SPACE IS

           HANDSOME, AND WELL DECORATED. It is sharp contrast to

           the bleak surroundings, shacks and dungeons Solomon has

           largely been accustom to during his time of slavery. It

           will be the "first and last time such a sumptuous resting

           place was granted" during his twelve years of bondage.

                         89 CONTINUED: 89

           Solomon doesn't have much chance to luxuriate in his

           surroundings. He hears a DOG BARKING just outside, and

           is unnerved. Has Tibeats returned to finish what he

           started?

           From a study, Master Ford appears with a gun in hand. He

           goes to the door, opens it and looks outside. He can see

           nothing. Satisfied, Ford crosses back over to Solomon.

           He is frank with Solomon regarding the situation.

                          FORD

           I believe Tibeats is skulkin'

           about the premises somewhere. He

           wants you dead, and he will

           attempt to have you so. It's no

           longer safe for you here. And I

           don't believe you will remain

           passive if Tibeats attacks. I

           have transferred my debt to Edwin

           Epps. He will take charge of you.

                          SOLOMON

           (desperate, urgent)

           Master Ford, you must know; I am

           not a slave.

                          FORD

           I cannot hear that.

                          SOLOMON

           Before I came to you I was a

           freeman.

                          FORD

           I am trying to save your life!

           And...I have a debt to be mindful

           of. That, now, is to Edwin Epps.

           He is a hard man. Prides himself

           on being a "nigger breaker." But

           truthfully I could find no others

           who would have you. You've made a

           reputation of yourself. Whatever

           your circumstances, you are an

           exceptional nigger, Platt. I fear

           no good will come of it.

           -END OF JANUARY, 1842-

           From the back porch, we come into the scene on EDWIN

           EPPS; a repulsive and coarse man. His language gives

           speedy and unequivocal evidence that he has never enjoyed

           the advantages of an education.

          61.

                         90 CONTINUED: 90

           Epps reads the Bible to his slaves, eight of them

           altogether. ABRAM; a tall, older slave of about sixty

           years. WILEY, who is forty eight. PHEBE, who is married

           to Wiley. BOB and HENRY who are Phebe's children, EDWARD

           and PATSEY. Patsey is young, just 23 years old...though

           in the era, 23 not as young as in the present day. She

           is the offspring of a "Guinea nigger," brought over to

           Cuba in a slave ship. She nearly brims with unconversant

           sexuality.

           MISTRESS EPPS, Epps's wife, is also present. She sits

           with, holds quite lovingly, some SLAVE CHILDREN. WITH

           THEM SHE IS VERY "MOTHERLY." We also see Epps's overseer

           TREACH. Treach constantly sports a LOADED PISTOL.

           Though Epps reads the word of the Lord, he lacks the tone

           of compassion with which Ford read.

                          EPPS

           "And that servant which knew his

           Lord's will...WHICH KNEW HIS

           LORD'S WILL and prepared not

           himself...PREPARED NOT HIMSELF,

           neither did according to his will,

           shall be beaten with many

           stripes..." D'ye hear that?

           "Stripes." That nigger that don't

           take care, that don't obey his

           lord - that's his master - d'ye

           see? - that 'ere nigger shall be

           beaten with many stripes. Now,

           "many" signifies a great many.

           Forty, a hundred, a hundred and

           fifty lashes... That's Scripter!

           -AUGUST, 1842-

           WE START THE SCENE WITH A PAIR OF BLACK HANDS

           picking cotton ferociously. As we move out, we identify

           PATSEY, a 23 year old striking black woman. The camera

           moves out again to a wider shot. This reveals several

           lines of slaves picking cotton, with Patsey way out in

           the lead. 

           We cut to another pair of black hands. This time,

           revealing SOLOMON, clumsy and unskilled hands, picking

           cotton. A lash bears down on him.

           It is August, "cotton picking" season.

           We are looking out over a cotton field in full bloom. It

           presents a visual purity, like an immaculate expanse of

           light, new-fallen snow. The cotton grows from five to

           seven feet high, each stalk having a great many branches

                          (CONTINUED)

           shooting out in all directions and lapping each other

           above the water furrow.

           There is a slave to each side of the row. They have a

           sack around their necks that hangs to the ground, the

           mouth of the sack about breast high. Baskets are placed

           at the end of the furrows. Slaves dump their sacks of

           cotton in the baskets, then pick until their sacks are

           again filled.

                          EDWARDS

           Pick that cotton. Move along now.

           THE SOUNDTRACK TO THE SCENE IS NOTHING MORE THAN THE

           RUSTLE OF LABOR, THE MALE CICADAS BUGS "TYMBALS" IN THE

           HEAT and a SPIRITUAL SUNG BY THE SLAVES.

           Despite the heat, there is no stopping for water. The

           slaves are "driven" by Edward, who is himself "driven" by

           Treach.

                          TREACH

           C'mon. Drive dem niggers.

           Edward moves among the slaves, applying the whip to them

           without regard.

           The day's work is done. The slaves are now assembled in

           the gin house with their baskets of cotton which are

           being weighed by Treach. There is anxiety among the

           slave, the reason for which soon becomes apparent.

           In the distance, a flogging is going on. Solomon, Phebe,

           and Wiley are stripped, placed in a stockade and now

           being given a perfunctory whipping delivered by ANOTHER

           IDENTIFIED SLAVE.

           EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION - EVENING

           Evening, but the day is not yet done. Slaves attend

           their various evening chores; feeding livestock, doing

           laundry, cooking food. There is no respite from a

           slave's charge.

           INT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT

           A fire is kindled in the cabin. The slaves finally fix

           their own dinner of corn meal. Corn is ground in a small

           hand mill. The corn meal is mixed with a little water,

           placed in the fire and baked. When it is "done brown"

           the ashes are scraped off. Bacon is fried. As the

           slaves eat, Abram goes on in great length and with much

           emotion about General Jackson.

                          UNCLE ABRAM

           Hold my words: General Jackson

           will forever be immortalized. His

           bravery will be handed down to the

           last posterity. If ever there be

           a stain upon "raw militia," he

           done wiped away on the eight of

           January. I say da result a that

           day's battle is of 'mo importance

           to our grand nation than any

           Despite the lateness of the hour, the slaves are up and

           now fully dressed. They take up position in the middle

           of the floor. They wait, poised like actors. Solomon

           strikes up a tune; Henry joins in with a pan flute and

           the slaves dance. They do so very wearily. The whole of

           it certainly more torture than pleasure.

           Epps, whip in hand:

                          EPPS

           Where's yah merriment? Move yer

           feet.

           As the slaves twirl about Epps keeps an attentive eye on

           Patsey. It should be quite clear that his primary

           motivation for holding dances is so that he may view

           Patsey twirl about the floor.

           This fact is not lost on Mistress Epps. A few moments of

           Epps's lust on display is all that the Mistress can bear.

           Jealousy mounting, she snatches up a CARAFE. With all

           her might she throws it at Patsey. It hits Patsey square

           in the face. TOO THICK TO SHATTER, IT LEAVES HER BLOODY

           AND WRITHING ON THE FLOOR. The dancing, the music stop.

           The slaves, however, react as though it is not the first

           time they've seen as much from the Mistress.

           Mistress Epps, screaming like a hellion:

                          MISTRESS EPPS

           Sell her!

                          EPPS

           from this property, 'er I'll take

           myself back to Cheneyville.

                          EPPS

           Back to that hog's trough where I

           found you? Oh, the idleness of

           that yarn washes over me. Do not

           set yourself up against Patsey, my

           dear. That's a wager on which you

           will not profit. Calm yerself.

           And settle for my affection,

           'cause my affection you got. Or,

           go. 'Cause I will rid myself of

           yah well before I do away with

           her!

           Mistress Epps stands irate, lost in fury and unable to

           even think of what to do. Eventually, optionless, she

           storms away.

           For a few beats there is only the sound of Patsey

           sobbing.

                          EPPS (CONT'D)

           That damned woman! I won't have

           my mood spoiled. I will not.

           Dance!

           Epps sends the whip in Solomon's direction. Solomon

           responds by playing.

           Treach literally drags the prone Patsey from the floor,

           blood still spilling from her face. The slaves, as

           ordered, return to dancing.

           I will, Mistress.

           Solomon looks at the list. In a careless moment, Solomon

           reads quietly from it. He catches himself, but not

           before the Mistress notes his action. With high

                          INQUISITIVENESS:

           EXT. ROAD - DAY

           Solomon walks along a well-worn path, shopping bag draped 

           over one shoulder. We see his feet. As the walk slowly 

           gathers pace, Solomon suddenly turns left into dense 

           foliage. His tread is now a full blown sprint, trees 

           flash past as Solomon attacks his way through the woods. 

           The sound of branches cracking underneath. His feet, 

           heartbeat and breath almost deafening. He is desperate. 

           The violence of his advance abruptly stops, there is 

           silence. We see in a clearance a posse of patrollers, 

           preparing for a lynching of two young men. Solomon's 

           eyes meet theirs. The two men look back at Solomon with 

           a look of fear as one of the patrollers checks the noose 

           around their neck. Suddenly the bloodhounds start 

           barking and the patrollers turn in the direction of 

           Solomon. Solomon's whole body shakes with anticipation. 

                          PATROLLER 

                          (AGGRESSIVELY) 

           Boy, where are you going? 

                          SOLOMON 

           (almost tripping over 

                          HIS WORDS) 

           To the store, Sir, to 

           Bartholomew's. I was sent there 

           by Mistress Epps. 

           The patroller reaches out for Solomon's free pass around 

           his neck, yanking him forward. He looks at it. 

                          PATROLLER 

           Get there and get there quick. 

           The patroller kicks Solomon hard, sending him on his way. 

           Solomon walks on, looking one more time at the two young 

           men; again there is a moment of connection. 

           Solomon turns. The two men are hoisted up, kicking and 

           spitting, behind his shoulder. 

           Solomon finds himself back on the trail walking towards 

           Bartholomew's, his face now full of shock and

           QUANTITY OF FOOLSCAP.

           The items are collected for Solomon and placed in a sack.

           Solomon giving little thought to them other than getting

           them back to the mistress.

           Sitting on the Grand house's Piazza, Patsey is having tea

           with MISTRESS HARRIET SHAW, WHO IS A BLACK WOMAN. Though

           once a slave, she is now comparatively refined though not

           wholly so. The table where they sit is adorned with

           white linens, and they are attended by a HOUSE NIGGER.

           It makes for a tranquil surreal scene.

           beyond a timely manner.

          B105 EXT. SHAW'S HOUSE - DAY B105

           Still running, slick with sweat, Solomon comes upon the

           SHAW HOUSE.

           As Solomon arrives:

                          MASTER SHAW

           Platt Epps, good Sunday morning.

                          SOLOMON

           Good morning, Master Shaw. I've

           been sent by Master to retrieve

           Patsey. May I approach?

                          MASTER SHAW

           You may.

           Solomon makes his way over to the piazza.

                          SOLOMON

           Excuse me, Mistress Shaw.

                          MISTRESS SHAW

           Nigger Platt.

                          SOLOMON

           My apologies. Patsey, Master

           wishes you to return.

                          PATSEY

                          SOLOMON

           Understood. But the Master sent

           me running to fetch you, and said

           no time should be wasted.

                          MISTRESS SHAW

           Drink tea?

           Thank you, Mistress, but I don't

           dare.

                          MISTRESS SHAW

           Would you knowed Massa Epps's

           consternation ta be any lessened

           wit your timely return? Sit. Sit

           and drink the tea that offered.

           Solomon knows better, but he sits and the Mistress has

           tea poured for him.

           What'n was Epps's concern?

                          SOLOMON

           ...I'd rather not say...

           L'il gossip on the Sabbath be

           fine. All things in moderation.

           Solomon is not sure what to say. He struggles to be as

           diplomatic as possible.

                          SOLOMON

           As you are aware, Master Epps can

           be a man of a hard countenance.

           There are times when it is

           impossible to account for his

           logic. You know he has ill

           feelings toward your husband.

                          MISTRESS SHAW

           He do.

                          SOLOMON

           Master Epps has somehow come to

           believe, as incorrectly as it may

           be, that Master Shaw is... That

           he is something of a lothario and

           an unprincipled man. A misguided

           belief born out of their mutual

           competition as planters, no doubt.

                          MISTRESS SHAW

           No doubt...if not born outta truth

           itself.

           The Mistress waves to Shaw. Shaw, unsuspecting of the

           conversation, waves back.

                          SOLOMON

           I'm certain Patsey's well being is

           Master Epps's only concern.

                          MISTRESS SHAW

           Nothin' Epps desire come outta

           concern.

                          SOLOMON

           I meant no disrespect.

                          MISTRESS SHAW

           I meant no disrespect to you,

           Mistress.

                          MISTRESS SHAW

           Ha! You worry for me? Got no

           cause to worry for my

           sensibilities. I ain't felt the

           end of a lash in 'mo years than I

           cain recall. Ain't worked a

           field, neither. Where one time I

           served, now I got others servin'

           me. The cost to my current

           existence be Massa Shaw

           broadcasting his affections, 'n me

           enjoyin' his pantomime of

           fidelity. If that what keep me

           from the cotton pickin' niggers,

           that what it be. A small and

           reasonable price to be paid 'fo

           sure.

           Looking toward Patsey, speaking with great empathy:

           MISTRESS SHAW (CONT'D)

           I knowed what it like to be the

           object of Massa's predilections

           and peculiarities. And I knowed

           they can get expressed with

           kindness or wit violence. A lusty

           visit in the night, or a

           visitation from the whip. And wit

           my experience, if'n I can give

           comfort, then comfort I give. And

           you take comfort, Patsey; the Good

           Lord will manage Epps. In His own

           time the Good Lord will manage dem

           all. Yes, Lordy, there's a day

           comin' that will burn as an oven.

           It comin' as sure as the Lord is

           just. When His will be done...the

           curse on the Pharos is a poor

           example of all that wait 'fo the

           plantation class.

           Mistress Shaw turns her head to the side, catching a

           slave's attention. As she does so, the slave, a YOUNG

           WOMAN, commences to pour tea.

           As if to punctuate her thought, the Mistress takes a sip

           of her tea.

           Solomon and Patsey are returning from Shaw's. Waiting on

           the porch of the Great House, a drunk Epps beckons for

           Patsey, his lewd intentions obvious.

           Do not look in his direction.

           Continue on.

           Epps does not care to be ignored. He lifts himself and

           moves toward the pair in a rage.

                          EPPS

           Patsey...!

           Solomon moves between Epps and Patsey, cutting Epps off

           as Patsey continues on. Playing up his "ignorance" of

                          THE SITUATION:

                          SOLOMON

           Found her, Master, and brought her

           back just as instructed.

                          EPPS

           What'd you jus now tell her?

           What'd you say to Pats?

                          SOLOMON

           No words were spoken. None of

           consequence.

                          EPPS

           Lie! Damned liar! Saw you

           talkin' with 'er. Tell me!

                          SOLOMON

           I cannot speak of what did not

           occur.

           Epps grabs Solomon.

                          EPPS

           I'll cut your black throat.

           Solomon pulls away from Epps, RIPPING HIS SHIRT IN THE

           PROCESS. Epps gives chase. Solomon begins to run around

           the large pig sty, easily keeping his distance. Epps,

           however is undeterred. He moves after Solomon as

           speedily as he can, which isn't very speedily at all.

           And quickly he tires. Epps is forced to bend over and

           suck air. Solomon maintains his distance, barely

           breathing hard. His breath returned to him, Epps starts

           up the chase again. Solomon runs on out of reach.

           Shortly, Epps again stops, gets his breath... And now in

           what should be quite comical, Epps again runs after

           Solomon. Again, Epps's vigor leaves him before he can

           even get close to the slave.

           Dropping down to the dirt, in a show of regret and piety:

           Platt... Platt, liquor filled me.

           I admit that it did, and I done

           over reacted. It's the Lord's

           day. Ain't nothin' Christian in

           us carryin' on like this. Help me

           ta my feet, and let us both pray

           to the Lord for forgiveness.

           Epps extends a hand to Solomon. Cautiously, Solomon

           moves close, but not too close. As Solomon draws within

           striking distance, Epps lunges for him. He chases

           Solomon on until he is again out of breath and once more

           drops down. And again offering a treaty:

                          EPPS (CONT'D)

           I'm all done in, Platt. I have

           met my limitations, and I ain't

           equal to 'em. I concede to yah,

           but in the name of valor, help yer

           master to his feet.

           Solomon cautiously moves closer to help. Again he is

           attacked by Epps - this time by knife. Sort of. Epps is

           too drunk and tired to fully open the folding blade - and

           chased far around the field by Epps. ALL OF THE

           PRECEDING SHOULD BE MORE FUNNY THAN SHOCKING. A CHANGE

           OF PACE FROM THE OTHERWISE NECESSARY BLEAKNESS OF SLAVE

           LIFE.

           Mistress Epps comes running from the house to the pair.

                          MISTRESS EPPS

           What? Wha's the fuss?

                          SOLOMON

           A misunderstanding is all. It

           began when I was sent to retrieve

           Patsey from where she'd taken

           sabbatical at Master Shaw's. Upon

           returning, Master Epps believed

           Patsey and me to be in

           conversation when we were not. I

           tried to explain, but it lead to

           all this.

                          MISTRESS EPPS

           What is it? Ya cain't remain the

           Sabbath without her under your

           Discretion being the better part and all, Solomon remains

           -AUGUST, 1844-

           With the sun yet again high in the sky the slaves are

           working the field picking cotton. As before THEY SING A

           SPIRITUAL, the only thing that distracts them from the

           tedium at hand.

           But there is no distracting from the heat. We see Henry

           begin to falter before it... And eventually collapse

           right in the dirt. Though the other slaves take note,

           none move to help him. None dare.

           From Treach rather matter of factly:

                          TREACH

           Get him water.

           Edward runs to fetch a gourd. He carries it to Henry,

           DUMPS THE WATER ON HIM, BUT DOES NOT ACTUALLY GIVE HENRY

           ANYTHING TO DRINK.

           Roused, Henry rights himself.

                          EDWARD

           Go'won. Git up.

           Unsteadily, Henry lifts himself and goes back to picking

           cotton. He joins in again with the spiritual, as if the

           song is all that can keep him going.

           The slaves are asleep. Epps arrives, again without

           knocking, with his whip in hand. The slaves stir. Uncle

                          ABRAM ASKS:

                          UNCLE ABRAM

           We dance tonight, massa?

           Epps remains quietly focused on Patsey. And it's clear

           from her apprehensive expression just what it is he's

           come looking for. This time there is no escaping it. As

           if to acknowledge the badness to come, Phebe lightly

           cries.

           EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/SMOKE HOUSE - NIGHT

           On top of a wood pile, in the back of the smoke house -

           Epps shoves Patsey. He stops, stands as if gathering his

           manhood, then he's all over Patsey. He is rough and

           clumsy. It looks like something between an awkward rape

           and a virgin attempting his first sexual encounter.

           Patsey does not respond in any way other than to

           continually turn her head from Epps, but otherwise remain

           as still as possible. If there is such a thing, she is

           vicious with her passive aggressiveness.

           Epps's frustration mounts until - as the Mistress Shaw

           had cautioned - he crosses the line from passion to

           violence. He begins slapping Patsey to get a response

           from her. When that fails, he punches her which only

           leads to him taking up his whip and lashing Patsey

           MERCILESSLY. Still, she gives him nothing. Beaten,

           Patsey sits in the dirt among the cotton, Epps deep

           breathing above her. The desire for sex now having left

           him.

           Epps heads from the field. Patsey is left where she is.

           Solomon is making his way back to the Epps plantation.

           He carries with him a sack filled with the goods from the

           store. As he walks, SOLOMON LOOKS AROUND CASUALLY. When

           he is certain he is alone, he sets down the sack, opens

           it and appropriates A SINGLE SHEET OF THE PAPER which he

           folds and places in his pocket. That done, he cinches up

           the sack and continues on his way.

           Solomon takes the slip of paper and hides it within his

           fiddle. Perhaps the safest place he can think of. He

           acts as though he's hiding away found gold. In reality

           it's more than that. For Solomon the paper is a first

           step toward freedom.

           It's another night of Epps's forced revelry. Coming in

           quick from the previous scene, we go from Solomon holding

           his fiddle, to playing it as the slaves are again made to

           dance.

           Mistress Epps brings out a tray of freshly baked

           pastries. She sets them down on a table.

                          MISTRESS EPPS

           A moment from the dancing. Come

           sample what I baked for y'all.

           The slaves, thankful for the rest as much as the food,

           file toward the tray reciting a chorus of "Thank you,

           Mistress." As Patsey moves toward the pastries:

           MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D)

           There'll be none for you, Patsey.

           Patsey merely turns away. Her non responsiveness,

           however, serves only to incite the Mistress. Screaming:

           MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D)

           Yah see that? Did yah see the

           look of insolence she give me?

           hot, hateful scorn. It filled

           that black face. Yah tell me yah

           did'n see it, then yah choose not

           to look, or yah sayin' I lie.

           back to us in the dark a night.

           Yah want that? Yah want them

           black animals to leave us gut like

           pigs in our own sleep?

           Epps isn't sure how to respond to the inchoate berating.

           It's an invitation for the Mistress to continue.

           MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D)

           You are manless. A damned eunuch

           if ever there was. And if yah

           won't stand for me, I'd pray you'd

           at least be a credit to yer own

           kind and beat every foul thought

           from 'em.

           Epps does nothing. The Mistress lets her anger loose.

           She moves quickly to Patsey, DRIVES HER NAILS INTO THE

           PATSEY'S FACE AND DRAWS THEM DOWN ACROSS HER FEATURES.

           FIVE DEEP AND BLOODY GASHES ARE LEFT IN PATSEY'S SKIN,

           the moment marked with appropriate screams. Patsey

           collapses on the floor, covering her bleeding face.

           MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D)

           Beat it from 'em!

           Thoroughly cuckolded by the Mistress's actions, Epps

           takes his whip and pulls Patsey out of the house. His

           intentions are plain.

           All the slaves remain silent. The Mistress, however,

           displaying high satisfaction, entreats the others:

           MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D)

           Eat. Fill yourselves. ...And

           then we dance.

           The slaves eat, but without a hint of levity.

           of the cabin and removes something from a secretive

           location. She then moves over to Platt.

           LADY'S FINGER RING.

                          PATSEY (CONT'D)

           I secreted it from the Mistress.

                          SOLOMON

           Return it!

           It yours, Platt.

                          SOLOMON

           For what cause?

                          PATSEY

           All I ask: end my life. Take my

           body to the margin of the swamp--

           Solomon looks at Patsey as though she were insane.

                          SOLOMON

           No.

                          PATSEY

           Take me by the throat. Hold me

           low in the water until I's still

           'n without life. Bury me in a

           lonely place of dyin'.

                          SOLOMON

           No! I will do no such thing.

           The...the gory detail with which

                          YOU SPEAK--

                          PATSEY

           I thought on it long and hard.

                          SOLOMON

           It is melancholia, nothing more.

           How does such despair even come to

           you?

                          PATSEY

           How can you not know? I got no

           comfort in this life. If I cain't

           buy mercy from yah, I'll beg it.

                          SOLOMON

           There are others. Beg them.

                          PATSEY

           I'm begging you!

                          SOLOMON

           Why? Why would you consign me to

           damnation with such an un-Godly

           request?

           acts. Won't be no hell for you.

           Do it. Do what I ain't got the

           strength ta do myself.

           Solomon says nothing. Clearly he's not about to do the

           deed. With nothing else to do, knowing she is damned

           with every breath she draws, Patsey crawls back to her

           spot on the floor and lays herself down.

           EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/FIELD - DAY

           -JULY, 1846-

           Hard times on the planation. Where previously the field

           in bloom was a carpet of white, it is now patchy and

           under grown.

           The slaves move through the field picking not cotton, but

           rather COTTON WORMS from the plants. The cotton worms

           have dined on the cotton and nearly destroyed the crop.

           We see the cotton worms in extreme close-up, moving among

           and destroying the cotton crop.

           Epps is beside himself as he looks out over his ruined

           field.

                          EPPS

           It is a plague.

           A plague! It's damn Biblical.

           Two season God done sent a plague

           to smite me. I am near ruination.

           Why, Treach? What I done that God

           hate me so? Do I not preach His

           word?

           TREACH (O.S.)

           The whole Bayou sufferin'.

                          EPPS

           I don't care nothin' fer the damn

           Bayou. I'm sufferin'.

           Epps looks among his slaves at work, his enmity growing.

                          EPPS (CONT'D)

           It's that Godless lot. They

           brought this on me. I bring 'em

           Crazed, Epps runs into the field, taking himself from

           slave to slave delivering a whipping to all he can lay

           his hands on.

                          EPPS (CONT'D)

           -OCTOBER, 1846-

           Henry, Bob, Uncle Abram and Solomon sit in the back of a

           cart. SOLOMON HAS HIS FIDDLE WITH HIM. Epps has

           delivered the men to JUDGE TURNER, a distinguished man

           and extensive planter whose large estate is situated on

           Bayou Salle within a few miles of the gulf. Epps and

           Turner stand off to one side engaged in bargaining as

           Henry, Bob, Uncle Abram and Solomon wait and watch.

           One of the slaves whisper under their breath.

                          EPPS' SLAVE

           I hear cutting cane is twice as

           hard as picking cotton.

           Boy, you two have no sense.

           Epps returns to his slaves and gives a parting

           salutation.

                          EPPS

           Yer Judge Turner's for the season.

                         118 CONTINUED: 118

           Slaves are crammed into the shack - LITERALLY ON TOP OF

           EACH OTHER - as they try to sleep. Some lay, some sit

           up. Packed in like cattle, there is barely room to move

           let alone draw a deep, clean breath. There is a real

           risk of suffocating in the mass. Some cough and wheeze.

           A CHILD CRIES...

           Among them is Solomon who must believe at this point that

           his life has reached its very lowest point. The odds of

           survival are slight, let alone the chance of actually

           ever returning to his family. This clearly weighs on him

           as he struggles to find anything like comfortable space

           in the pen.

           EXT. CANE FIELDS - DAY

           An OVERSEER is explaining to the new slaves - SOLOMON

           AMONG THEM - how to cultivate cane. WITH A KNIFE IN HAND

           he demonstrates the process:

                          OVERSEER

           Draw the cane from the rick, cut

           the top and flags from the stalk,

           understand? Leave only that part

           which is sound and healthy. Cast

           off the rest...

           EXT. CANE FIELDS - DAY

           -NOVEMBER, 1846-

           ABOUT THIRTY SLAVES are working the field. They are

           divided into THREE GANGS. The first which draw the cane,

           the next lay the cane in the drill, the last then hoe the

           rows after.

           Solomon is among a gang that draws and cuts, and he moves

           with speed and skill. Certainly more so than he

           displayed picking cotton.

           Standing with his overseer, Judge Turner watches.

           INT. SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT

           Again, the slaves have been herded into the shack and

           pressed together.

           As he tries to rest - sleep is nearly impossible -

           Solomon finds himself face to face with a woman, ANNA.

           She is awake. For a few beats she avoids eye contact

           with Solomon. She seems, like Solomon, to be

           unaccustomed to her surroundings and horribly frightened

           by them. Eventually her eyes meet Solomon's. She makes

           no sound, but great apprehension spills from her eyes.

           Whatever's next, whatever horror awaits, she can barely

           stand to face. Fear, proximity... They drive her hand

                          (CONTINUED)

           herself with genuine human contact, the woman TAKES

                          (CONTINUED)

          82.

                         121 CONTINUED: (2) 121

           SOLOMON'S HAND AND PRESSES IT TO HER BREAST. Solomon

           tries to jerk his hand away, but ANNA HOLDS IT IN PLACE.

           Manipulating Solomon's hand, she begins to massage her

           breast. Solomon takes no real pleasure in the act -

           really, neither does Anna. THERE SHOULD BE A TRUE SENSE

           ANNA IS JUST SO VERY, VERY DESPERATE FOR HUMAN CONTACT,

           FOR THE NEED TO FEEL ALIVE AND LIKE A PERSON RATHER THAN

           AN ANIMAL THAT EMOTIONALLY SHE IS WILLING TO ENGAGE

           SOLOMON.

           The need quickly compounds. Anna presses her lips to

           Solomon's. Eventually, SHE DIRECTS HIS HAND BENEATH HER

           DRESS AND BETWEEN HER LEGS. Solomon, with slightly more

           compassion than a guy making union wages, BEGINS TO

           MANIPULATE ANNA WITH HIS HAND. The act remains more

           perfunctory than passionate.

           We can see Anna moving toward climax and eventual

           release. But more - or substantially less - than joyous

           sex, it is really just a drug-like inoculation against

           reality. But the feeling quickly fades. All that

           remains, as with most chance encounters, is regret.

           And there is shame, too. This is put on display as Anna

           turns away from Solomon. As quickly as it began, it is

           as though the act had not happened at all.

           Solomon waits outside the house on the porch. A house

           servant - ZACHARY - approaches and admonishes Solomon.

                          ZACHARY

           Off the porch. Get off.

           Like a dog shooed away, Solomon steps down.

           Eventually Judge Turner exits the house and crosses to

           Solomon.

                          SOLOMON

           ...Sir...

                          JUDGE TURNER

           Platt is it? Have you cultivated

           cane previously?

                          SOLOMON

           No, sir, I have not.

                          JUDGE TURNER

           You take to it quite naturally.

           Are you educated?

           Niggers are hired to work, not to

           Turner gives that a bit of consideration as he gives

           Solomon a wary looking over.

                          JUDGE TURNER

           You play the fiddle?

                          SOLOMON

           I do.

                          JUDGE TURNER

           Willard Yarney, a planter up the

           bayou, celebrates his anniversary

           in a three week's time. I will

           hold out your name to him. What

           you earn is yours to keep.

          124 EXT. TURNER PLANTATION - LATER (MOVED FROM 124) 124 

           Work over, the slaves congregate to eat.

           As Solomon eats, he takes note of the JUICE FROM SOME

           BERRIES ON HIS PLATE.

          125 EXT. TURNER'S PLANTATION - EVENING (MOVED FROM 125) 125 

           Solomon plays with a piece of cane, fashions it into some

           kind of writing tool, testing it in the mud. He then

           brushes over the dirt with his hand.

          84.

          126 EXT. TURNER PLANTATION - NIGHT (MOVED FROM 126) 126 

           Secreted away out near the edge of the bayou and sitting

           by a small fire, Solomon takes the slip of paper from his

           fiddle. It is yellowed, showing age, but still usable.

           Dipping the piece of cane - a quill - into the crushed

           berries, Solomon attempts to write a bit on the paper.

           The berry juice, too free-flowing, is unusable as ink.

           Solomon returns the paper to the fiddle. He has some

           scraps of food with him, which he snacks on.

          A127A INT. SLAVE SHACK - DAY A127A 

           We see a sharp object scratching onto a surface. The 

           tool moves on to form another mark. The sound is 

           repetitive and almost unbearable. As we move out, we see 

           the names Anne, Margaret, Alonzo. They are engraved onto 

           the violin, in the hidden area where Solomon would rest 

           his chin. 

           Solomon looks at it for a moment, moving his fingertips 

           across the engraving. His face full of loss. 

           Sadly, he lifts his instrument under his chin and leaning 

           his head to the side as if to play. 

          127 INT. YARNEY'S HOUSE - EVENING 127

           A party has commenced at the noble home of one MR.

           YARNEY. A group of REVELERS have gathered and are on the

           dance floor, in fancy dress. Their faces are covered with

           a variation of decorative masks. The party is a feast of

           celebration. As entertainment, SOLOMON ACCOMPANIES A

           GROUP OF MUSICIANS, no more than three. And as he does

           so, they all play with jovial liveliness. Clearly a good

           time is being had by all.

           EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

           His playing done for the evening, Solomon is returning to

           Judge Turner's on foot. There is only the moonlight with

           which to light the way. As he walks, Solomon eats from a

           HEARTY CHUCK OF BREAD. Obviously part of his haul from

           the evening. Solomon again hears noises coming from the

           brush just up ahead of him. Solomon tears off some of

           the bread, kneels and holds it out before him.

                          SOLOMON

           C'mere. C'mon, boy.

           This time, there is no dog. Instead, from the dark and

           the brush step TWO BLACK MEN. Solomon stands. He looks

           the men over - their clothes tatters and they themselves

           covered in dirt. It becomes quite clear they are not

           just slaves. A fact confirmed when they step menacingly

           toward Solomon, ONE WITH A SHIV IN HAND.

           At first it seems they want Solomon's food or money.

           Worse, THEY GO FOR HIS FIDDLE.

           Solomon has but a moment to brace himself before he is

           attacked, TAKING A CUT TO THE ARM. Solomon fights back,

           PICKING UP A PINE KNOT and striking his attacker over the

           head. That takes the fight out of him, and both men

           retreat back the way they came leaving Solomon be.

           Runaways I would expect. The

           Bayou full with 'em. They nothin'

           They acted out of desperation.

          130 EXT. TURNER PLANTATION - NIGHT 130

           -FEBRUARY/MARCH, 1847-

           Alone out on the edge of the Bayou, Solomon is playing a

           low air on his violin WHILE SNACKING ON SCRAPS OF BACON.

           As he plays, something appears in the distance. From the

           edge of the bayou, coming forth like an apparition arisen

           from the earth, is CELESTE. She is a young woman of

           about 19 years of age and far whiter than most blacks.

           "IT REQUIRED CLOSE INSPECTION TO DISTINGUISH IN HER

           FEATURE THE SLIGHTEST TRACE OF AFRICAN BLOOD." Beyond

           that, she is pale and haggard, but still lovely.

           Dressed in a white gown, she emerges from the water.

           Draped on her dress, her period. A line in her skirt.

           It's very visible, but not shocking. A ribbon of red in

           her dress.

           Celeste moves to Solomon without fear or hesitation. As

           Solomon, startled, takes her in, Celeste says quite

                          PLAINLY:

                          CELESTE

           I am hungry. Give me food.

                          SOLOMON

           Who are you?

                          CELESTE

           I'm hungry.

           Solomon gives Celeste some of his food. Celeste,

           famished, devours it.

                          SOLOMON

           What is your name?

                          CELESTE

           My name is Celeste.

                          SOLOMON

           What are your circumstances?

                          CELESTE

           I belong ta Massa Carey, and 'ave

           been two days among da palmettoes.

           Celeste is sick and cain't work,

           and would rather die in the swamp

           than be whipped to death by the

           overseer. So I took myself away.

           Massa's dogs won't follow me. The

           patrollers 'ave tried to set dem

           on me. But dey a secret between

           dem and Celeste, and dey won't

           mind the devilish orders of the

           overseer.

           Celeste lifts her head from the food on which she gnaws.

                          CELESTE (CONT'D)

           Do you believe me?

                          SOLOMON

           Yes.

                          CELESTE

           Why?

                          SOLOMON

           There are some whose tracks the

           hounds will refuse to follow.

                          CELESTE

           Give me more food. I'm starvin'.

                          SOLOMON

           This is all my allowance for the

                          REST OF--

                          CELESTE

           Give it to me.

           Almost as if compelled, Solomon does as ordered. As she

           eats, Celeste aggrandizes herself:

                          CELESTE (CONT'D)

           Most slaves escape at night. The

           overseers are alert for such

           chicanes. But Celeste tricked dem

           'n alight in the middle of the day

           wit the sun up at its highest.

           The place of my concealment now

           deep in the swamp, not half a mile

           from Massa's plantation, and a

           world apart. A world a tall

           trees whose long arms make fo' a

           canopy so dense dey keep away even

           the beams of the sun. It twilight

           always in Celeste's world, even in

           the brightest day. I will live

           there, and I will live freely.

           The overseers are a cowardly lot.

           Dey will not go where their dogs

           show fear and where it always be

           night. Others will join me in the

           twilight, and we ain't gunna be

           slaves no 'mo forever.

                         130 CONTINUED: (2) 130

           Solomon isn't sure what to say. Before he can say

                          ANYTHING:

                          CELESTE (CONT'D)

           Celeste will come to you again in

           the night. You will have food for

           her.

           Celeste departs the way she came; as though she were a

           vision.

                         131 131

           INT. JUDGE TURNER'S PLANTATION/FOOD STORAGE - NIGHT

           Solomon stealthfully makes his way into the storage shed.

           Dried and smoked meats are hung, and milled corn is

           about. Taking out a handkerchief, Solomon begins to load

           it with food. Not too much. Not so much his thievery

           will be readily noticed, but he does avail himself.

                         132 132

           EXT. TURNER PLANTATION - NIGHT

           Solomon plays his violin, but plays it with an anxious

           nature as he waits.

           Then, as before, a figure appears in the distance. It is

           Celeste coming out of the night. She makes her way

           directly to Solomon. With no greeting, she says:

                          CELESTE

           I am hungry.

           Solomon gives Celeste the handkerchief he's filled. She

           opens it, and begins to devour the food. As she eats:

                          CELESTE (CONT'D)

           I was rude, and didn't even ask yo

           name.

           Solomon. Solomon is my true and

           free name.

                          CELESTE

           Was you free?

                          SOLOMON

           I was. I am.

           Solomon exposes his wrist, displays his tattoo as he

                          ANNOUNCES:

                          SOLOMON (CONT'D)

           I remain free in my heart.

                         132 CONTINUED: 132

           Giving a laugh as though it's the silliest thing she's

                          HEARD:

                          CELESTE

           Free heart means nothin if'n yo

           body gunna die a slave.

                          SOLOMON

           I will not.

                          CELESTE

           How? Celeste knows you ain't

           gunna run. Celeste knows it ain't

           your nature.

                          SOLOMON

           I have a plan. I have a letter.

                          CELESTE

           A letter? How'll yah mail da

           letter? Who yah trust to post it?

           A nigger that can read and write

           is a nigger that'll hang.

           There is a pause. Solomon can't answer this question. It

           is the glaring hole in his plan.

           Having finished eating:

                          CELESTE

           You will bring Celeste 'mo food.

           And with that Celeste again moves back into the darkness.

           Solomon is picking at the bark off a WHITE MAPLE.

           In a tin cup, over a fire, Solomon boils the white maple

           bark in just a bit of water.

          137 INT. JUDGE TURNER'S PLANTATION/SLAVES CABIN - NIGHT 137

           As others sleep, by the light of dying coals, Solomon

           uses the quill to test the boiled bark. The liquid holds

           as a form of ink. It is no?t ideal, but it is legible on

           the page. Armed with this, Solomon writes his letter.

           EXT. TURNER PLANTATION - NIGHT

           Solomon sits with Celeste. He relates his news to her.

           I have my letter.

                          CELESTE

           Yah has your freedom then?

                          SOLOMON

           All that remains is to contrive

           measures by which the letter can

           safely be deposited in the post

           office.

           When Celeste speaks she is quite melancholy.

           Solomon gives an unnerved look. This is not good news.

                          SOLOMON

           Is it more food you need?

                          CELESTE

           I live in fear.

                          SOLOMON

           None will come after you in the

           swamps.

                          CELESTE

           It ain't the patrollers I scared

           of... At all seasons the howling

           of wild animals can be heard at

           night along the border of the

           swamps. At first their calls were

           welcomin'. Dey too was free, 'n I

           thought dey greeted me like a

           sistah. Lately, dey cries have

           turned horrifyin'. They mean to

           kill Celeste.

                          SOLOMON

           The solitude plays tricks. It's

           your impression, nothing more. If

           you go back to your master you

           could face the same.

                          CELESTE

           My freedom been nothin' but a

           daydream. So was Celeste's

           thoughts of slaves conjoinin' in

           the bayou.

                          SOLOMON

           Better the loneliness. You have

           been free most of the summer.

           Return now and your master will

           make example of you.

                          CELESTE

           It is lonely dwellin' waiting for

           You won't be caught. The dogs

           won't track you. You are...you

           are unique. Celeste...

           You got alternatives, Solomon.

                          SOLOMON

           To return is to die!

                          CELESTE

           Celeste got no one to write a

           letter to.

           As if to punctuate her resolve, without a word more

           Celeste departs toward the swamp. Solomon starts on into

           the swamp after her.

                          SOLOMON

           Celeste... Celeste!

           Solomon continues after Celeste, wading deeper into the

           dark night and murky waters.

                          SOLOMON (CONT'D)

           Celeste, I will guide you north!

           Wait, and I will take you.

           Celeste is too nimble. She outpaces Solomon, continues

           on and disappears into the night.

                          SOLOMON (CONT'D)

           Let me take you! Let me go with

           you!

           Solomon runs on, then splashes to a stop. He stumbles

           around disoriented, calling into the blackness:

                          SOLOMON (CONT'D)

           Celeste...

           Nothing. No answer. Not a human one. There are sounds

           and echoes - some in the distance, some perhaps moving

           closer - which, moment by moment, become more and more

           frightening. Soon, Solomon realizes he is in quite

           literally over his head; the water first chest deep, then

           neck deep. With no way to orient himself, no means to

           guide him in the dark, Solomon's reserve begins to

           crumble. He thrashes in the water trying to find his way

                          (CONTINUED)

          93.

                         138 CONTINUED: (3) 138

           back to shore. No longer trying to save Celeste, Solomon

           calls to her - desperately - for assistance.

                          SOLOMON (CONT'D)

           Celeste! Come to me, Celeste!

           In that moment Solomon is quite certain he is nearly

           done; that he will not find land, nor aid and that this

           is his final moment. His panic should be that tangible.

           It is either force of will, or survival instinct...or

           maybe just pure luck that carries Solomon on until he

           reaches first muddy ground, then firm footing. Hauling

           himself onto the swamps edge, Solomon finally collapses

           in a drenched, worn heap. His life spared, but Celeste

           never to be seen again.

           -MAY/JUNE, 1847-

           We come up now outside of Master Epps's plantation. Epps

           stands in the drive. He's in surprisingly good spirits

           as Solomon, Uncle Abram, Henry and Bob trudge their way

           wearily toward Epps and his other slaves who are

           gathered.

           The cotton field is in full bloom, the crop fully

           returned.

                          EPPS

           A joyous day. A joyous day. Dark

           times is behind us. Clean livin'

           'n prayer done lifted the plague.

           Indicating to the cotton:

                          EPPS (CONT'D)

           As thick 'n white as New England

           snow. 'N now my niggers is

           returned to me.

                          (TO SOLOMON)

           Heard Judge Turner gave you favor.

           Oh, did you beguile him, Platt,

           with your slick nigger ways?

           Well, yah won't stand idle, boy.

           Not on my land. Much work to do.

           Days of old long since, eh?

           Joyous! Joyous indeed!

           Throughout Epps's welcome, Solomon's focus is on Patsey

           who is lined up with the other slaves. SHE IS NOW MORE

           HAGGARD THAN WHEN WE LAST SAW HER. Her face and arms

           display many new scars. It's clear that in the

           intervening years she has quite literally been a whipping

           boy for Epps and the Mistress.

           The slaves are out working on the field. White hands

           appear, picking cotton: ARMSBY. He is wholly unskilled at

           picking cotton, and he puts little effort into the job.

           As we meet him he seems a decent sort if a little short

           on self-motivation. In anachronistic terminology, he'd

           be called a "slacker." He joins in with the slaves,

           singing a spiritual.

           INT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/GIN HOUSE - EVENING

           As Epps said, it is days of long since. The slaves are

           back to having their cotton weighed in the Gin House

                          EPPS

           Wiley...?

                          TREACH

           Two hundred sixty pounds.

                          EPPS

           Bob?

                          TREACH

           Three hundred forty pounds for

           Bob.

                          EPPS

           Patsey?

                          TREACH

           Five hundred twenty pounds.

                          EPPS

           Tha's a girl. Don't never let me

           down. Platt?

                          TREACH

           One hundred sixty pounds.

           Before Treach is even done announcing the weight, Epps

           has pulled Solomon aside to where Uncle Abram already

           awaits his fate.

                          EPPS

           Armsby?

                          TREACH

           Sixty four pounds.

           Epps speaks to Armsby sternly, but nothing of the manner

           in which he would address the slaves.

                          (CONTINUED)

           A good days labor would average

           two hundred pounds.

                          ARMSBY

           Yes, sir.

                          EPPS

           I'm sure in time y'll develope as

           a picker, but it takes effort,

           boy. Put some damn effort into

           it.

                          ARMSBY

           Yes, sir.

           To Treach, regarding Solomon and Abram:

                          EPPS

           Take 'em out. Get to whippin'.

           No force is needed. The slaves understand the situation.

           They follow Treach out of the Gin house.

                         142 142

           EXT. EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT

           We come in after the punishment has been dealt. Patsey

           tends to Uncle Abram's back as Armsby applies liniments

           to Solomon's. As he does, Armsby muses:

                          ARMSBY

           It's a tragedy. How does such

           come to pass? Working a field and

           picking cotton like a lowly hand.

           I'm of a damn sight better

           station. And my desires never

           lacked for a grandiose component,

           though I will admit they have at

           times been short on ingenuity.

           But only at times. I've worked as

           an overseer, you know.

                          SOLOMON

           I did not, sir.

                          ARMSBY

           Not "sir." Just Armsby. Not owed

           more than any other in the field.

           I worked plantations from

           Virginia, down into Alabama. I

           could manage easy a hundred slaves

           and have done so. But to toil in

           the field? Never thought that

           would come to pass. Never. But

           times are desperate. Where once I

           had said "no" to Epps and his

           merger offerings, I returned cap

           in hand. ...Look at what I've

           become.

                          SOLOMON

           How did you arrive at such a

           place, if I may ask?

                          ARMSBY

           Ask. It's just conversation.

           From a pocket Armsby produces a flask.

                          ARMSBY (CONT'D)

           I became a little too dependant on

           the whisky, a little too

           undependable on the job. Before

           you say I'm just a sorry drunkard,

           let me state my case: As reliable

           employment as overseeing is, it's

           no easy chore on the spirit. I

           say no man of conscious can take

           the lash to another human day in,

           and day out without shredding at

           his own self. Takes him to a

           place where he either makes

           excuses within his mind to be

           unaffected... Or finds some way

           to trample his guilty sensations.

           Well, I trampled.

           Armsby takes a drink.

                          ARMSBY (CONT'D)

           And with frequency.

                          SOLOMON

           Where is your place of birth?

                          ARMSBY

           Maryland. Have you traveled

           there?

                          SOLOMON

           ...I cannot say that I have.

                          ARMSBY

           Fine country. More seasonal than

           the bayou. A deal less humid.

                          SOLOMON

           Why did you leave it?

                          ARMSBY

           To make my fortune, of course. I

           gave in to tales of wealth and

           prosperity that were the lore of

           the southern states: all that's

           needed being a patch of land and a

           few good growing seasons. Cotton,

           or tobacco. And then locating a

           proper bank in which to store your

           riches. But such profitable

           outcomes are reserved for the

           plantation masters. It's the lot

           of the rest of us to serve. So I

           settled on being an overseer, and

           failed as well at that. In the

           meantime my dreams gave way to

           reality. Now, I want nothing more

           than to earn a decent wage.

                          (BEAT)

           And get myself home.

           Armsby takes another drink and leans back.

           INT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACKS - MORNING

           -AUGUST, 1847-

           We again hear the sound of the HORN BLOWING signaling the

           start of the work day for the slave.

          144 EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/FIELD - DAY 144

           With the sun yet again high in the sky the slaves are

           working the field picking cotton. As before they sing a

           spiritual, the only thing that distracts them from the

           tedium at hand.

           But there is no distracting from the heat. We see Uncle

           Abram begin to falter and finally drop down to the

           ground.

           Treach calls to Edward:

                          TREACH

           Get him water.

           Edward runs to fetch water which he carries to Abram and

           DUMPS ON HIM...BUT ABRAM DOES NOT RISE. DOES NOT MOVE.

           At this point, the sounds of the singing from the others

           tapers off as they realize Abram isn't getting up.

                         145 145

           EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE CEMETERY - LATER

           We are beyond the main of the plantation, the cotton

           field in the background. We are at the slaves' cemetery,

           a mixture of crude crosses and unsettled ground.

           Solomon, Bob and Henry, now much visually older than when

           we first saw them, are digging a grave in the dirt. The

           uncovered body of Abram lays near. Having dug down an

           appropriate distance, the three men take the body and,

           very unceremoniously, place it into the ground. Holding

           the shovel in his hands, and resting it by his feet, Bob

           tilts his head down and closes his eyes. The others do

           the same. Almost stutteringly, not really knowing what to

                          SAY--

                          BOB

           I just want to say something about

           Uncle Abram. He was a good man and

           he always looked out for us since

           we were little. God Bless him. God

           love him. And God keep him.

           That done, they begin to cover it with dirt. It is all

           the more of a funeral that Abram will receive.

           A female voice appears out of the blackness and begins to

           sing solo, "Went down to the river Jordan." A response of

           "Oh Yeah" quickly follows. Again the singer continues,

           "where John baptized three."

           The same faces we have seen on Epps' plantation, but now

           filled with rapture, appear. It's as if the voices have

           created a new form of awakening and presence. It seems to

           transcend and translate in a strange way, joy. A joy

           which has un-yet been seen on screen. A joy which has

           been hidden, but a joy which is undoubtedly there. It's

           captivating, infectious.

           This should be a moving part of the film, which stirs the

           audience and, for a moment, relieves them of the

           seemingly chastising environment.

           The singer continues, "Well some say John was a Baptist,

           some say John was a Jew, but I say John was a preacher,

           because the Bible says so too, preach on Johnny." And

           with that, the rest of the congregation chant "I believe.

           Oh, I believe."

           The door opens. Solomon enters. Armsby is surprised to

           see him. So much so, he isn't sure what greeting to

           give. Solomon gives a blunt introduction. Re: the

                          COINS:

                          SOLOMON

           The proceeds of my fiddling

           performances. A few picayunes,

           but all I have in the world. I

           promise them to you if you will do

           me the favor I require. But I beg

           you not to expose me if you cannot

           grant the request.

                          ARMSBY

           What do you ask?

                          SOLOMON

           First, your word, sir.

                          ARMSBY

           On my honor.

                          SOLOMON

           It is a simple enough request. I

           ask only that you deposit a letter

           in the Marksville post office.

           And that you keep the action an

           inviolable secret forever. The

           details of the letter are of no

           consequence. Even at that, there

           would be an imposition of much

           pain and suffering were it known I

           was the author. A patron is what

           I require, sir.

                          ARMSBY

           Where's the letter now?

                          SOLOMON

           ...It is not yet written. I will

           have it in a day. Two at most, my

           skill with composition as poor as

           it is.

           Armsby considers the request.

                          ARMSBY

           I will do it. And will accept

           whatever payment is offered.

           Solomon hesitates. In the moment, he's not so sure he

           can wholly give himself over to trust.

           compensation is all I ask.

           Solomon hands over the money.

                          ARMSBY (CONT'D)

           again. In two days?

           Solomon and the slaves pick cotton. Armsby is

           conspicuously NOT laboring in the field. As Solomon

           works he is watched by Epps. Watched more than he

           normally is. For a moment it seems it might just be a

           matter of perspective; Solomon's unease over his actions.

           But soon Epps is joined by Armsby. The two men stand and

           talk, their looks locked toward Solomon.

           Whatever it is that is occurring between them continues

           for a long, long moment. But Epps makes no move toward

           Solomon. Solomon continues with his work.

           INT. EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT

           The slaves are at rest. Gripping his whip Epps enters,

           without so much as a knock at the door. For a moment

           there's curiosity; is he there for a dance, for

           Patsey...?

           Looking right to Solomon:

                          EPPS

           Get up.

           Solomon does. Epps heads back out into the dark. He

           says nothing, but his directive is clear: Follow me.

          153 EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACK - CONTINUOUS 153

           Solomon comes out into the dark. Nearly hidden in the

           shadows is a bitter Epps. Despite the lack of light,

           Epps's malevolence is quite clear. His whip attached to

           his hip. As he speaks, he stokes himself with swigs from

           a FLASK.

           Epps puts his arm around Solomon, as if consoling a

           friend, and guides him into the woods.

           Solomon, hardly missing a beat, plays this off.

                          EPPS (CONT'D)

           Well, Armsby tol' me today the

           devil was among my niggers. That

           I had one that needed close

           watchin' or he would run away.

           When I axed him why, he said you

           come over to him and waked him up

           in the middle of the night and

           wanted him to carry a letter to

           Marksville. What have yah got to

           say to that?

           that need be said. There is no

           truth in it.

                          EPPS

           You say.

                          SOLOMON

           How could I write a letter without

           ink or paper? There is nobody I

           want to write to 'cause I hain't

           got no friends living as I know

           of. That Armsby is a lying

           drunken fellow. You know this,

           just as you know that I am

           constant in truth. Now, master, I

           can see what that Armsby is after,

           plain enough. Didn't he want you

           to hire him for an overseer?

           A beat.

                          SOLOMON (CONT'D)

           That's it. He wants to make you

           believe we're all going to run

           away and then he thinks you'll

           hire an overseer to watch us. He

           believes you are soft soap. He's

           given to such talk. I believe

           he's just made this story out of

           whole cloth, 'cause he wants to

           get a situation. It's all a lie,

           master, you may depend on't. It's

           all a lie.

           For a tense moment we are unsure which way Epps'll go.

           Increasingly it become apparent that, shallow minded and

           equally soused, Solomon has been able to fold Epps's

           thoughts. In a low curse that clearly states his ill

           intentions.

           Revealed is a pocket knife, which all through the

           conversation, unknown to us the audience, was pushed up

           against Solomon's stomach. As Epps speaks, he closes it

           and taps it on Solomon's shoulder.

                          EPPS

           Having found a lonely spot, Solomon has struck a SMALL

           FIRE. He has in his hand his letter. With no ceremony,

           he casts the letter upon the flames and watches it burn.

           And with it, at this time, seems all chance of him ever

           being free. He stands and looks at it as if forever, as

           ashes descend into the night sky.

           FADE TO BLACK.

           The slaves are now employed working on an extension to

           the Great House. The slaves work under the direction of

           MR. SAMUEL BASS, a between forty and fifty years old, of

           light complexion and light hair. He is cool and self-

           possessed, fond of argument, but always speaking with

           extreme deliberation as well as a Canadian accent.

           EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/GREAT HOUSE - DAY

           As the slaves continue to work, there is a conversation

           going on between Epps and Bass. Bass much skilled in the

           art of sophistry, while Epps's arguments are fueled

           mostly by emotion alone. Though at first Epps does

           little more than joke his way around the facts.

           Solomon, working still, can't help but overhear as Epps

           offers Bass a drink, which Bass waves away.

                          EPPS

           Take it. You look unsettled.

                          BASS

           I'm well.

                          EPPS

           No shame in taking respite from

           the heat; drink, shade. It's

           ungodly for travelers. Hearty, or

           otherwise.

           Your humor is inadvertent.

           Sensing perhaps Bass's laughter might be at his expense,

           Epps presses.

                          EPPS

           Then share what's funny. Or what

           ills you.

                          BASS

           I'm here to complete the work at

           hand. As requested, and as paid.

                          EPPS

           Something rubs you wrongly.

           Before I take further offense, I

           offer you the opportunity to speak

           on it.

                          BASS

           You ask plainly, I will tell you

           plainly. What I find amusing: You

           worry about my well being in the

           heat but, quite frankly, the

           condition of your laborers--

                          EPPS

           "The condition of my..." What in

           the hell are you--

                          BASS

           It is horrid. It's all wrong.

           All wrong, sir.

                          EPPS

           They ain't hired help. They're my

           slaves.

                          BASS

           You say that with pride.

                          EPPS

           I say it as fact.

                          BASS

           If the conversation concerns what

           is factual and what is not;

           there's no justice nor

           righteousness in slavery. I

           wouldn't own a slave if I was rich

           as Croesus, which I am not, as is

           perfectly well understood. More

           particularly among my creditors.

           There's another humbug: the credit

           system. Humbug, sir. No credit,

           no debt. Credit leads a man into

           temptation. Cash down is the only

           evil. But this question of

           slavery; what right have you to

           your niggers when you come down to

           the point?

                          BASS

           Of course you did. The law says

           you have the right to hold a

           nigger, but begging the law's

           pardon...it lies. Is everything

           right because the law allows it?

           Suppose they'd pass a law taking

           away your liberty and making you a

           That ain't a supposable case.

                          BASS

           Because the law states that your

           liberties are undeniable? Because

           society deems it so? Laws change.

           Social systems crumble. Universal

           truths are constant. It is a

           fact, it is a plain fact that what

           is true and right is true and

           right for all. White and black

           alike.

           Whoa, whoa, whoa. Yah compare me

           to a nigger, Bass? Yah might as

           well ask what the difference is

           between a white man and a baboon.

           human beings. If they are allowed

           to scale no higher than brute

           animals, you and men like you will

           clothes against washing boards and hanging them up to dry

           near to their living quarters behind the plantation. It

                          MISTRESS EPPS

           Do it! Strike the life from her.

           Epps again hoists the whip. It trembles in his hand

           ahead of the act... But he does not have it in him to

           deliver such a beating. Turning to Solomon, thrusting

           the whip at him:

                          EPPS

           Beat her.

           Solomon doesn't move. Epps shoves the whip into his

           hand.

                          EPPS (CONT'D)

           Give her the whip. Give it all to

           her!

           Patsey, begging to Solomon:

                          PATSEY

           I'd rather it you, Platt.

                          EPPS

           Strike her, or yah'll get the

           same!

                          (CONTINUED)

          109.

                         156 CONTINUED: (4) 156

           Solomon takes a step back. He unfurls the whip... He

           begins to whip Patsey. Lash after lash, Patsey squirms

           before it. Epps eyes fill with tears, he is nearly too

           distraught to watch.

           But the Mistress... She is not satisfied with Solomon's

           half-hearted effort.

                          MISTRESS EPPS

           He pantomimes. There ain't barely

           a welt on her. That's what your

           niggers make of yah; a fool fer

           the takin'.

           Epps's grief is replaced by fury. EPPS GRABS THE PISTOL

           FROM TREACH'S HOLSTER and draws down on the slaves.

                          EPPS

           Yah will strike her. Yah will

           strike her until her flesh is rent

           and meat and blood flow equal, or

           I will kill every nigger in my

           sight!

           Solomon can't strike a blow, even if it means his life.

           But from the ground, from Patsey:

                          PATSEY

           Do it, Platt. Don't stop until I

           am dead.

           What else can he do? Solomon begins to whip, to truly

           whip Patsey. Her back welts, then tears... Patsey

           screams in agony. Solomon strikes again and again...

           After a full thirty lashes Solomon looks to Epps, who is

           not satisfied.

                          EPPS

           Until I say no more! I ain't said

           nothing!

           Solomon strikes another ten to fifteen times. By now, as

           promised, Patsey's back has been reduced to LITTLE MORE

           THAN TORN MEAT AND BLOOD.

           Finally, Solomon holds low the whip. He can and will do

           no more.

                          EPPS (CONT'D)

           Strike her! Strike her!

           Solomon will not. Epps takes up the whip and whips

           Patsey with "ten fold" greater force than he had. The

           painfully loud and angry curses of Epps load the air.

           Patsey by now is terribly lacerated, literally flayed.

           The lash wet with blood which flowed down her sides and

           dropped upon the ground. At length Patsey ceases

           struggling. Her head sinks listlessly on the ground.

                          (CONTINUED)

                         156 CONTINUED: (5) 156

           Her screams and supplications gradually decrease and die

           away into a low moan. It would seem that she was dying.

           Solomon, screaming at Epps:

                          SOLOMON

           Thou devil! Sooner or later,

           somewhere in the course of eternal

           justice thou shalt answer for this

           sin!

           Though Epps fronts rage, there should be underlying

           anguish for what he has done to his beloved Pats.

                          EPPS

           No sin! There is no sin! A man

           does how he pleases with his

           property. At the moment, Platt, I

           am of great pleasure. You be

           goddamn careful I don't come to

           wantin' to lightenin' my mood no

           further.

           By contrast to this horror, the field of cotton smiles in

           the warm sunlight. The birds chirp merrily amidst the

           foliage of the tress. Peace and happiness seems to reign

           everywhere.

           Everywhere else.

           Epps leaves Patsey to herself. He says not a word to the

           Mistress as he passes. The Mistress herself heads back

           into the house.

           Solomon unties Patsey, lifts her and takes her to the

           cabin.

           INT. CABIN - LATER

           Patsey is laid on some boards where she remains for a

           long time with eyes closed and groaning in agony. Phebe

           applies melted tallow to her wounds, and all try to

           assist and console her.

           In time Patsey opens her eyes. She looks to Solomon.

           She does not say a word. She just looks at him...and

           then her eyes close again.

                          EVENING

           -APRIL, 1852-

           Solomon and Bass are working together alone on the

           extension. From the amount of work that's been done on

           it, it should be obvious that days have now passed.

           Solomon makes a cautious approach to Bass. As casually

           as he can he inquires:

                          SOLOMON

           Master Bass, I want to ask you

           what part of the country you came

           from?

                          BASS

           No part of this land. I was born

           in Canada. Now guess where that

           is.

                          SOLOMON

           Oh, I know where Canada is. I

           have been there myself.

                          BASS

           Have you?

                          SOLOMON

           Montreal and Kingston and

           Queenston and a great many places.

           And I have been in York state,

           too. Buffalo and Rochester and

           Albany, and can tell you the names

           of the villages on the Erie canal

           and the Champlain canal.

           Bass gives Solomon a long and curious stare.

                          BASS

           Well traveled for a slave. How

           came you here?

                          SOLOMON

           Master Bass, if justice had been

           done I never would have been here.

                          BASS

           How's this? Tell me all about it.

                          SOLOMON

           I am afraid to tell you, though I

           don't believe you would tell

           Master Epps if I should.

                          BASS

           Every word you speak is a profound

           secret.

                          (CONTINUED)

           Solomon holds a moment. Hasn't he heard the same promise

           before? Prior to Solomon stating his case, WE FADE TO:

          161 INT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION / ADDITION - DAY 161

           Hours have passed. Bass reflects on the story that Epps

           has told in the intervening.

                          BASS

           How many years all told?

                          SOLOMON

           Just nearly...just passed eleven.

                          BASS

           Your story is...it is amazing, and

           in no good way.

                          SOLOMON

           Do you believe, sir, in justice as

           you have said?

                          BASS

           I do.

                          SOLOMON

           That slavery is an evil that

           should befall none?

                          BASS

           I believe so.

                          SOLOMON

           If you truly do, I would ask...I

           would beg that you write my

           friends in the north, acquainting

           them with my situation and

           beseeching them to forward free

           papers, or take such steps as they

           might consider proper to secure my

           release.

           Bass looks at Solomon, holding his gaze for more than a

           prolonged beat.

                          SOLOMON (CONT'D)

           My daughter Margaret is possibly

           now 19 and my son Alonzo, 16. I

           miss them so. It would be an

           unspeakable happiness to clasp my

           wife and my family again.

           Bass hands Solomon an end of a long plank of wood and

           looks over his shoulder, as if to camouflage the

           conversation by work. They both lift it toward the

           floorboards. Finally Bass speaks.

                          BASS

           I have always forgone

           relationships and family. I did

           once have a sweetheart who I loved

           deeply.

           Bass points to a measuring tool, which Solomon

           immediately hands over.

                          BASS (CONT'D)

           But that was a long, long time

           ago. I've been traveling this

           country for the best part of

           twenty years. My freedom is

           everything. The fact that I can

           walk out of here tomorrow gives me

           most pleasure. I see the aching in

           your eyes, the pain of not being

           attached to your loved ones. My

           life doesn't mean much to anyone,

           but it seems your life means a lot

           to a lot of people. What you have

           just said to me scares me, and I

           must say, sir, I am afraid. Not

           just for you, but for me.

           They continue working, fixing the floorboards in unison.

           Solomon, slightly confused.

                          BASS (CONT'D)

           I will write your letter sir, for

           if I could bring freedom to you,

           it will be more than a pleasure.

           It will be a duty. Now, would you

           be so kind as to pass me those

           nails, sir.

           We pull back to reveal the two men dwarfed by the

           unfinished structure. They continue to work, as if the

           conversation had never occurred.

           Solomon walks a path he has walked a thousand times or

           more on his way back from Bartholomew's - sack familiarly

           slung over his right shoulder. Drearily he walks. His

           eyes acknowledge something we yet cannot see to his left.

           what he was looking at is revealed.

           FEET hang at the top right hand corner of the frame. A

           woman, who has been lynched.

           To a now virtually complete, half-painted white gazebo.

           Slaves continue to work on it. As they do so, Bass peels

           away from the structure to have an overview. He beckons

           Solomon toward him, out of earshot from the slaves who

           are continuing to work on the gazebo. As Solomon

           approaches, Bass shouts-

                          BASS

           And bring those markers!

           Solomon gathers a clutch of markers in his hands and

           approaches Bass.

                          BASS (CONT'D)

           No letter yet.

                          SOLOMON

           You are certain?

           Bass takes a marker from Solomon and slides it into the

           earth.

                          BASS

           I have inquired thoroughly. More

           than is safe for either of us.

           Bass takes another and pokes it into the ground,

           improvising a pathway towards the gazebo.

                          BASS (CONT'D)

           Solomon...I have a job or two on

           hand which will be completed

           Bass doesn't need to spell things out for Solomon.

           Solomon's understanding of the finality of the situation

           should be very clear.

                          BASS (CONT'D)

           You must know, wherever I am I

           will press your cause.

                          SOLOMON

           Five months. On top of these

           years. No cause remains.

                          BASS

                          SOLOMON

           Go home knowing you have tried.

           The weight of defeat should hang very heavily with both

           men. Nothing more to do, nothing more to say BASS TAKES

           SOLOMON'S HAND, GRIPS IT FIRMLY, BUT LOW AND

           SURREPTITIOUSLY knowing full well he cannot be seen

           making contact with a slave. But in the strength of

           their collective grip, in the emotion in which they hold

           each other's eyes, we should be able to easily see how

           greatly Bass wanted to be able to help Solomon. Equally,

           we can see the depth of regard Solomon has for Bass. The

           moment is made all the more powerful by the fact neither

           man can openly speak his regret or thanks. A moment

           longer, and then Bass releases his grip and makes his

           way marching toward the gazebo, pointing instructions.

           Solomon is left, markers in hand, alone.

           Solomon sits on a secluded part of the road, fiddle in

           hand. He stares across the expanse. His eyes fixed on

           something that is a million miles away.

           Slowly Solomon tunes his fiddle, turning the tuning peg

           tighter and tighter. As the strings are taut, the sound

           is almost unbearable as Solomon tightens bit by bit, as

           if bones are being cracked one by one. Just beyond the

           breaking point of sound, there is a snap.

           He then repeats the action.

           Solomon holds the neck of the violin. Sliding his thumb

           and forefinger down the neck, he methodically cracks it

           at the base. He carefully snaps the neck and removes it

           from the body, then snaps it in two, placing it on the

           ground.

           He then starts on the body. Heaving it on the ground, it

           falls apart. Methodically he breaks the violin into small

           bits - silencing the instrument with a hushed display of

           violence, rather than aggressive. Seems almost to be, in

           an odd way, respectful.

           their way in the trying soil. Solomon, too focused to

           note the arrival of two men by carriage: Parker and the

           SHERIFF.

           While the Sheriff makes his way to the field, Parker

           remains with the carriage. The Sheriff calls:

           ...Sir...

           The Sheriff crosses to him.

                          SHERIFF

           Your name is Platt, is it?

                          SOLOMON

           Yes, sir.

           Pointing off to the distance.

                          SHERIFF

           Do you know that man?

           Solomon looks toward the carriage. He has to shield his

           eyes from the sun. Recognition is slow coming to him.

           But when it does, it hits him as a rush.

                          SOLOMON

           Mr. Parker...?

           Solomon starts for Parker, but he is pulled back by the

           Sheriff who is keen to determine Solomon's true identity.

                          SHERIFF

           Say again?

                          SOLOMON

           Mr. Parker?

           As he does, Epps makes his way over.

                          SHERIFF

           That man received a letter

           compiling many accusations. You

           look me in the eye and on your

           life answer me truthfully: have

           you any other name than Platt?

                          SOLOMON

           Solomon Northup is my name.

                          EPPS

           Sheriff...

                          SHERIFF

           Have you a family?

                          EPPS

           What's all this?

                          SHERIFF

           It's official business.

                          EPPS

           My nigger, my business.

                          SHERIFF

           Your business waits.

                          (TO SOLOMON)

           Tell me of your family.

                          SOLOMON

           I have a wife and two children.

                          SHERIFF

           What were your children's names?

                          SOLOMON

           Margaret and Alonzo.

                          SHERIFF

           And your wife's name before her

           marriage?

                          SOLOMON

           Anne Hampton. I am who I say.

           Solomon pushes past the sheriff. As Solomon moves toward

           Parker, his pace quickens with each step until his

           personal velocity has him nearly at a dead run. The two

           old friends make contact with each other, wrap each other

           in a long and emotional embrace. It if finally broken by

           Epps, who has moved over with the Sheriff.

           Nah... You will unhand 'em.

           Platt is my nigger!

                          PARKER

           He is Solomon Northup.

                          EPPS

           You say...

                          PARKER

           He belongs to no man.

                          EPPS

           You say! You come here,

           unfamiliar to me, and make claims.

                          SHERIFF

           Not claims. I have no doubts.

           This is Solomon Northup, a

           resident of Saratoga Springs, NY.

                          EPPS

           To hell with that! My nigger, and

           I'll fight you for 'em!

                          PARKER

           As is your right. As it will be

           my pleasure to bankrupt you in the

           courts. Your decision.

           By this time, the slaves in the plantation have overcome

           their fear of penalty, and left their work and gathered

           in the yard as witnesses. They stand behind the cabin,

           out of sight of Epps.

           Mistress Epps also bears witness, standing on the veranda

           next to her house slave. Her face is of a strange mixed

           emotion.

           Epps looks to Solomon. Solomon icily, stoically holds

           his ground. He makes it quite clear in his countenance

           that nobody owns him. Sheriff, hand on his gun, is there

           to back Solomon up. Epps, with no other recourse than to

                          BACK DOWN:

                          EPPS

           You think this is the last you'll

           see of me, boy? It ain't.

                          (TO PARKER)

           Whatever paper you hold about his

           freedom, it don't mean naught. He

           is my nigger - and I will have my

           day in court, sir. As God as my

           witness, I will have my day in

           court. Take 'em!

           Epps calls to Bob-

                          (CONTINUED)

          120A.

                         168 CONTINUED: (5) 168

                          EPPS (CONT'D)

           Saddle my horse! And bring her up

           here.

           Epps walks back into the plantation.

           The trio starts for the carriage. Solomon is pulled back

           by the call of Patsey's voice:

                          PATSEY

           Platt...

           Disregarding Parker, Solomon crosses over to Patsey.

           Under the circumstances, neither really knows how to

           engage. Finally, suddenly, Patsey throws her arms around

           Solomon and they embrace.

           Epps, now mounted on his horse, witness the encounter.

           Kicking the stirrups hard into the sides of the horse, he

           rides off furiously.

           Calling from the carriage, mindful of Epps:

                          PARKER

           Solomon...if we know what's wise,

           we should depart.

           A moment longer Solomon and Patsey hold each other. They

           separate, Solomon heading back to the carriage. He and

           Parker alight. The Sheriff chides the horses and they

                          (CONTINUED)

          121.

                         168 CONTINUED: (6) 168

           start up. As they move on, Patsey sinks down to the

           ground, where she remains in a weary and half-reclining

           state, the other slaves around her.

           WE STAY WITH Solomon as he travels further and further

           from the slaves - who are diminished by distance.

           Solomon waves a hand to them, but the carriage rounds a

           bend and a thicket of trees hides them from his eyes

           forever more.

           EXT. NORTHUP HOUSE - DAY

           -MARCH, 1853-

           We now see Solomon in front of a door. A door we have

           seen before at the very beginning of our story. Solomon,

           aged significantly since then, stands nervously,

           swallowing, and adjusting his attire. He breaths in and

           holds his breath. He blows out and closes his eyes. A

           tear falls from his cheek, but this is not the way he

           wants his family to see him. He gathers himself, and

           looks to his right. There stands Mr. Parker. He places

           his hand on Solomon's shoulder. He says gently-

                          PARKER

           Are you ready?

           Solomon swallows and nods.

                         169 169

           INT. NORTHUP HOUSE - LATER

           THE DOOR TO THE ROOM OPENS. Mr. Parker enters, Solomon

           behind. We first see Anne, in her finest attire; the

           Northup children: Alonzo, who is now seventeen and

           Margaret who is now twenty - SHE CARRIES WITH HER A

           BUNDLE. Also present is MARGARET'S HUSBAND. The family

           waits patiently, dutifully...but anxiously.

           Anne rises to greet him, but holds back. All around, the

           body language of the family is stiff and awkward. They

           are, after all - after twelve years - little more than

           familiar strangers.

                          SOLOMON

           I apologize for my appearance. I

           have had a difficult time of

           things these past many years.

           Solomon looks among his family; trying to recall them as

           much as they look to see familiarity within him. To his

                          CHILDREN:

                          SOLOMON (CONT'D)

           Alonzo... Margaret, yes? You do

           not recognize me, do you? Do

           you...do you even remember the

           last time we saw each other? I

           put you on a carriage with your

           mother...

           Margaret, tearing, hugs her father. Solomon almost

           breaks, but he keeps himself together. Looking to the

                          UNKNOWN MAN:

                          SOLOMON (CONT'D)

           And who is this?

                          MARGARET

           He is my husband.

                          SOLOMON

           Husband?

                          MARGARET'S HUSBAND

           It is very good to meet you, sir.

                          SOLOMON

           We have much acquainting to do.

           Margaret rises, she presents her bundle to her father.

                          MARGARET

           And this is your grandson.

           Solomon Northup Staunton.

                          SOLOMON

           ...Solomon...

           The fact his grandson carries his name, is overwhelming.

           Solomon breaks down. Emotionally, physically... But

           ANNE IS THERE TO CATCH HIM. As she holds him, Solomon

           says to Anne with all his heart:

                          SOLOMON (CONT'D)

           Forgive me.

                          ANNE

           There is nothing to forgive.

           The pair, joined now by the whole family, hold on to each

           other for life...and one would think for all the rest of

           their lives.

                          FADE TO:

                          BLACK

                          CARD:

           Upon gaining his freedom, Solomon Northup located and

           attempted to seek legal justice against the men who

           kidnapped him. The case was tried in Washington, DC

           where blacks were prohibited by law from testifying

                          (CONTINUED)

                         169 CONTINUED: (2) 169

           against whites. The charges against the kidnappers were

           eventually dismissed.

           Northup spent the rest of his life working as an

           abolitionist, and with the Underground Railroad.

           Solomon Northup most likely died between 1863 and 1875.

           The exact date, place, and circumstances of his death

           remain unknown.
