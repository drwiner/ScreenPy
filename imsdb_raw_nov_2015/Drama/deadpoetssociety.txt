Dead Poets Society: Final Script

INT. WELTON ACADEMY HALLWAY - DAY

A young boy, dressed in a school uniform and cap, fidgets as his mother

adjusts his tie.

				MOTHER

		Now remember, keep your shoulders back.

A student opens up a case and removes a set of bagpipes. The young

boy and his brother line up for a photograph

				PHOTOGRAPHER

		Okay, put your arm around your brother.

		That's it. And breathe in.

The young boy blinks as the flash goes off.

				PHOTOGRAPHR

		Okay, one more.

An old man lights a single candle. A teacher goes over the old

man's duties.

				TEACHER

		Now just to review, you're going to

		follow along the procession until you

		get to the headmaster. At that point

		he will indicate to you to light the

		candles of the boys.

				MAN

		All right boys, let's settle down.

The various boys, including NEIL, KNOX, and CAMERON, line up holding

banners. Ahead of them is the old man, followed by the boy with the

bagpipes with the two youngest boys at the front.

				MAN

		Banners up.

The boys hoist the banners and the bagpipes begin to play loudly. The

small group marches out of the room and down a set of stairs into a

church. The pews are filled with students and parents while the

teachers, all dressed in robes, are seated at the front of the church

behind the headmaster.

The boys break off to either side at the front of the church. The

bagpipes cease and the headmaster, MR. NOLAN, walks over to the old

man carrying the candle.

				MR NOLAN

		Ladies and gentlemen, boys, the light

		of knowledge.

An organ begins to play as the old man goes forward with shaking hands

to the young boys in the front pew. Each boy is holding a candle and

he bends over to light the first one. Each boy in turn lights the

candle of the boy next to him.

				MR NOLAN

		One hundred years ago, in 1859, 41 boys sat in this

		room and were asked the same question that greets

		you at the start of each semester. Gentlemen, what

		are the four pillars?

All throughout the pews, uniformed boys rise to their feet. TODD, who

is not wearing a uniform, is urged by his father to stand with them.

				BOYS

		Tradition, honor, discipline, excellence.

The boys quickly return to their seats.

				MR NOLAN

		In her first year, Welton Academy graduated five

		students. Last year we graduated fifty-one. And

		more than seventy-five percent of those went on to

		the Ivy League. This, this kind of accomplishment is

		the result of fervent dedication to the principles taught

		here. This is why you parents have been sending us

		your sons. This is why we are the best preparatory

		school in the United States.

Mr. Nolan soaks up the applause from the audience.

				MR NOLAN

		As you know, our beloved Mr. Portius of the English

		department retired last term. You will have the

		opportunity later to meet his replacement, Mr. John

		Keating, himself a graduate of this school. And who,

		for the past several years, has been teaching at the

		highly regarded Chester School in London.

The crowd applauds once again.

EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY

The school lawn is a filled with luggage, students, and parents mulling

about in every direction.

INT CHURCH ENTRANCE - DAY

Mr Nolan stands by the entrance, speaking with each family as they leave.

				MR NOLAN

		Glad you could come by.

				MR ANDERSON

		Thrilling ceremony as usual Dr. Nolan.

				MR NOLAN

		You've been away too long.

				MRS ANDERSON

		Hello Dr. Nolan.

				MR NOLAN

		Good to have you back.

				MRS ANDERSON

		This is our youngest, Todd.

				MR NOLAN

		Mr. Anderson.You have some big shoes to fill,

		young man. Your brother was one of our finest.

				TODD

		Thank you.

Todd and his parents leave while others file past Mr. Nolan.

				WOMAN

		Lovely ceremony.

				MR NOLAN

		Thank you. So glad you liked it.

MR PERRY approaches with his son Neil. He shakes Mr. Nolan's hand.

				MR PERRY

		Gale

				MR NOLAN

		Tom

				MR PERRY

		Good to see you again.

				NEIL

		Hello Mr. Nolan.

				MR NOLAN

		Neil. We expect great things from you this year.

				NEIL

		Thank you, sir.

				MR PERRY

		Well he won't disappoint us. Right Neil?

				NEIL

		I'll do my best sir.

EXT SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY

A bell tolls. Parents begin wishing their boys farewell.

				FATHER

		Hey, come on son.

				MOTHER

		Chin up.

				FATHER

		No tears now.

				BOY

		Okay.

				MOTHER

		Chin up.

Another boy hugs his mother.

				BOY

		I don't want to go here.

				MOTHER

		You be a good boy and do your lessons.

EXT SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY

Neil emerges from a building and sees Todd.

				NEIL

		Hey, I hear we're gonna be roommates.

He shakes Todd's hand.

				NEIL

		I'm Neil Perry.

				TODD

		Todd Anderson.

				NEIL

		Why'd you leave Balincrest?

				TODD

		My brother went here.

				NEIL

		Oh, so you're that Anderson.

INT DORMATORY - DAY

DR. HAGER is standing in his room doorway while SPAZ and his father are

going over some last minute precautions over the boy's allergies. Spaz's

father hands Hager various bottles.

				FATHER

		This is for sinuses. Oh, and if he can't swallow you

		give him one of these. And if he had trouble breathing

		you can give him some of those.

				HAGER

		All right fine.

Dr. Hager takes the bottles and quickly backs into his room, shutting

the door.

				FATHER

			    (to son)

		Did you remember your vaporizer?

				SPAZ

		Yes, I put it in my room.

Spaz's father tries to say something else to Dr. Hager but realizes he

has already gone.

INT HALLWAY - DAY

Neil pushes his way through a crowd of boys, carrying two suitcases. As

he enters his room, Knox quickly passes by.

				KNOX

		Hey, how's it going Neil?

				NEIL

		Hey Knox.

Cameron comes by and leans against the doorway.

				CAMERON

		Neil, study group tonight?

				NEIL

		Yeah, sure.

				CAMERON

		Business as usual, huh? Hey, I hear you got the new

		kid. Looks like a stiff!

He begins laughing when he notices Todd coming into the room.

				CAMERON

		Oops!

Cameron quickly leaves. Neil tries to keep from laughing as Todd enters

the room and sets his luggage down on his bed.

				NEIL

		Listen, don't mind Cameron. He was born with his

		foot in his mouth. You know what I mean?

He pulls some papers from his blazer pocket and playfully whacks Todd 

across the back with it.

CHARLIE comes to the door with a smug expression on his face. Knox and

MEEKS are close behind him. He points at Neil

				CHARLIE

		Rumor has it, you did summer school.

				NEIL

		Yep. Chemistry. My father thought I should get ahead.

		How was your summer Slick?

				CHARLIE

		Keen.

The boys enter the room. Charlie turns around and looks at Meeks who is

just entering. 

				CHARLIE

		Meeks. Door. Closed.

				MEEKS

		Yes sir.

				NEIL

		Gentlemen, what are the four pillars?

				BOYS

		Travesty. Horror. Decadence. Excrement.

Charlie makes himself comfortable on Neil's bed and lights up a cigarette.

Meanwhile, Todd is by his bed unpacking his luggage.

				CHARLIE

		Okay, study group. Meeks aced Latin. I didn't quite

		flunk English. So, if you want, we've got our study

		group.

				NEIL

		Sure. Cameron asked me too. Anyone mind

		including him?

				CHARLIE

		Hmm, what's his specialty, boot-licking?

				NEIL

		Come on, he's your roommate.

				CHARLIE

		That's not my fault.

Meeks seems to notice Todd for the first time.

				MEEKS

		Oh, I'm sorry, my name is Steven Meeks.

Neil quickly gets up from his spot by the window.

				NEIL

		Oh, this is Todd Anderson.

Todd turns around and shakes hands with Meeks.

				MEEKS

		Nice to meet you.

				TODD

		Nice to meet you.

				CHARLIE

		Charlie Dalton.

Charlie continues to lay on the bed, looking smug. Knox extends a hand.

				KNOX

		Knox Overstreet.

				NEIL

		Todd's brother was Jeffrey Anderson.

				CHARLIE

		Oh yeah, sure. Valedictorian. National merit scholar. 

				MEEKS

		Oh well, welcome to Hell-ton.

				CHARLIE

		It's every bit as tough as they say, unless you're a

		genius like Meeks.

				MEEKS

		He flatters me. That's why I help him with Latin.

				CHARLIE

		And English, and Trig.

Charlie begins coughing. There is a knock at the door. Charlie quickly

stamps out his cigarette on the floor and Neil tries to wave the smoke

from the air.

				NEIL

		It's open.

The door opens and Mr. Perry walks into the room. Neil quickly rises from

the window.

				NEIL

		Father, I thought you'd gone.

The other boys stand up when he enters.

				BOYS

		Mr. Perry.

				MR PERRY

		Keep your seats fellows, keep your seats. Neil, I've

		just spoken to Mr. Nolan. I think that you're taking

		too many extra curricular activities this semester, and

		I've decided that you should drop the school annual.

				NEIL

		But I'm the assistant editor this year.

				MR PERRY

		Well I'm sorry Neil.

				NEIL

		But Father, I can't. It wouldn't be fair.

				MR PERRY

		Fellas, would you excuse us for a moment?

Mr. Perry walks towards the door and Neil hesitantly follows. Mr. Perry

pauses by the door and smiles to the other boys.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

The smile has gone from Mr. Perry's face. He grabs a hold of Neil's arm.

				MR PERRY

		Don't you ever dispute me in public. Do you

		understand?

				NEIL

		Father, I wasn't disputing-

				MR PERRY

After you've finished medical school and you're on your own, then you

can do as you damn well please. But until then, you do as I tell you.

Is that clear?

				NEIL

		Yes sir. I'm sorry.

				MR PERRY

		You know how much this means to your mother,

		don't you?

				NEIL

		Yes sir. You know me, always taking on too much.

				MR PERRY

		Well, that's my boy. Now listen, you need anything,

		you let us know, huh?

				NEIL

		Yes sir.

Mr. Perry slaps his son on the shoulder and leaves. Neil leans his head

back against the wall as the other boys emerge from the room.

				CHARLIE

		Why doesn't he let you do what you want?

				KNOX

		Yeah Neil, tell him off. It couldn't get any worse.

				NEIL

		Oh, that's rich. Like you guys tell your parents off, Mr.

		Future Lawyer and Mr. Future Banker.

				CHARLIE

		Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do.

				NEIL

		Well just don't tell me how to talk to my father. You

		guys are the same way.

				KNOX

		All right, all right, Jesus. So what are you going to do?

				NEIL

		What I have to do. Drop the annual.

				CHARLIE

		Well I wouldn't lose much sleep over it. It's just a

		bunch of jerks trying to impress Nolan.

				NEIL

		I don't care. I don't give a damn about any of it.

				MEEKS

		Well, uh, Latin, eight o' clock in my room?

				NEIL

		Yes.

				MEEKS

		Todd, you're welcome to join us.

				KNOX

		Yeah, come along pal.

Todd looks up from his desk where he is setting his alarm clock.

				TODD

		Thanks.

EXT. FIELDS - DAY

A clock bell chimes five o'clock. Enormous flocks of birds, apparently

disturbed by the noise, take to the sky.

INT. STAIRCASE - DAY

The sound of squawking birds merges into the sound of noisy boys as they

descend the stairs in a long spiralling line.

MR. MCALLISTER tries to make it upstairs against the steady stream.

				MCALLISTER

		Slow down boys, slow down you horrible

		phalanx of pubescense.

INT CHEMISTRY LAB - DAY

A teacher walks up and down the aisles, handing out books.

				TEACHER

		Pick three laboratory experiments from

		the project list and report on them every

		five weeks. The first twenty questions at

		the end of chapter one are due tomorrow.

The students let out a collective groan.

INT. LATIN CLASSROOM - DAY

Mr. McAllister paces back and forth in front of the blackboard and gets

the students to repeat everything he says.

				MCALLISTER

			    (students repeat after each word.)

		Agricolam. Agricola. Agricolae.

		Agricolarum. Agricolis. Agricolas.

		Agrilcolis.

		Again, please.

		Agricola.

INT. MATH CLASSROOM - DAY

Dr. Hager walks up the classroom aisles with his arms behind his back.

				HAGER

		Your study of trigonometry requires absolute precision.

		Anyone failing to turn in any homework assignment will

		be penalized one point off their final grade. Let me urge

		you now not to test me on this point.

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

Students enter Keating's classroom, talking and acting up. Keating

glances out from his room off to one side.

				KNOX

		Hey Spaz, Spaz.

Spaz turns around in time to be hit by a ball of crumpled up paper

while Cameron smacks him on the shoulder.

				CAMERON

		Brain damage.

The students quickly quiet down as Keating emerges from the other room,

whistling the 1812 Overture. He walks up the length of the classroom and

out the door without a word. The students look around at one another,

uncertain of what to do. Keating pokes his head back in the doorway.

				KEATING

		Well come on.

He gestures them to follow and the students, after some hesitation, grab

their books and follow Keating out into the main entranceway. 

INT. ENTRANCEWAY - DAY

Keating stands before the school's trophy cabinets and waits until all

the boys arrive.

				KEATING

		"Oh Captain, My Captain" who knows where

		that comes from?

Todd looks up as if he knows the answer, but says nothing. Spaz blows his

nose a little too close to Meeks for his liking.

				KEATING

		Not a clue? It's from a poem by Walt

		Whitman about Mr. Abraham Lincoln. Now in

		this class you can call me Mr. Keating. Or,

		if you're slightly more daring, Oh Captain,

		My Captain.

The students laugh slightly.

				KEATING

		Now let me dispel a few rumors so they

		don't fester into facts. Yes, I too

		attended Hell-ton and survived. And no,

		at that time I was not the mental giant

		you see before you. I was the intellectual

		equivalent of a ninety-eight pound

		weakling. I would go to the beach and

		people would kick copies of Byron in my

		face.

The boys laugh once again, while Cameron, obviously trying to write all

this down, looks around confusedly. Keating looks down at papers in his

hand.

				KEATING

		Now, Mr... Pitts. That's a rather

		unfortunate name. Mr. Pitts, where are

		you?

Pitts raises his hand while everyone around him snickers.

				KEATING

Mr. Pitts, would you open your hymnal to page 542 and read the first

stanza of the poem you find there?

				PITTS

		"To the virgins, to make much of time"?

				KEATING

		Yes, that's the one. Somewhat appropriate,

		isn't it.

				PITTS

		"Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, old

		time is still a flying, and this same

		flower that smiles today, tomorrow will

		be dying."

				KEATING

		Thank you Mr. Pitts. "Gather ye rosebuds

		while ye may." The Latin term for that

		sentiment is Carpe Diem. Now who knows

		what that means?

Meeks immediately puts his hand up.

				MEEKS

		Carpe Diem. That's "seize the day."

				KEATING

		Very good, Mr.-

				MEEKS

		Meeks.

				KEATING

		Meeks. Another unusual name. Seize the

		day. Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.

		Why does the writer use these lines?

				CHARLIE

		Because he's in a hurry.

				KEATING

		No, ding!

Keating slams his hand down on an imaginary buzzer.

				KEATING

		Thank you for playing anyway. Because we

		are food for worms lads. Because, believe

		it or not, each and every one of us in

		this room is one day going to stop

		breathing, turn cold, and die. 

Keating turns towards the trophy cases, filled with trophies, footballs,

and team pictures.

				KEATING

		Now I would like you to step forward over

		here and peruse some of the faces from

		the past. You've walked past them many

		times. I don't think you've really looked

		at them.

The students slowly gather round the cases and Keating moves behind them.

				KEATING

		They're not that different from you, are

		they? Same haircuts. Full of hormones,

		just like you. Invincible, just like you

		feel. The world is their oyster. They

		believe they're destined for great things,

		just like many of you. Their eyes are full

		of hope, just like you. Did they wait until

		it was too late to make from their lives

		even one iota of what they were capable?

		Because you see gentlmen, these boys are

		now fertilizing daffodils. But if you listen

		real close, you can hear them whisper their

		legacy to you. Go on, lean in.

The boys lean in and Keating hovers over Cameron's shoulder.

				KEATING

			    (whispering in a gruff voice)

		Carpe.

Cameron looks over his shoulder with an aggravated expression on his face. 

				KEATING

		Hear it?

			    (whispering again)

		Carpe. Carpe Diem. Seize the day boys,

		make your lives extraordinary.

The boys stare at the faces in the cabinet in silence.

EXT. SCHOOL STEPS - DAY

The boys emerge from the school, loaded down with numerous books.

				PITTS

		That was weird.

				NEIL

		But different.

				KNOX

		Spooky if you ask me.

				CAMERON

		Think he'll test us on that stuff?

				CHARLIE

		Come on Cameron, don't you get anything?

				CAMERON

		What? What?

INT. LOCKER ROOM - EVENING

A coach sticks his head around the corner into the room.

				COACH

		Let's go boys, hustle up in here. That

		means you Dalton.

Meeks emerges from the showers, drying himself off.

				MEEKS

		Okay, who's up for a trig study group

		tonight guys?

				PITTS

		Me.

				NEIL

		Me.

				CHARLIE

			(still annoyed by what the coach said)

		What?

				KNOX

		I can't make it guys. I have to have

		dinner at the Danburry's house.

				PITTS

		The Danburry's? Who are the Danburry's?

				CAMERON

		Big alumns. How'd you swing that?

				KNOX

		Friends of my Dad's. They're probably in

		their nineties or something.

				CHARLIE

		Ooh!

				NEIL

		Anything's better than Hell-ton hash.

				CHARLIE

		I'll second that.

				KNOX

		Yeah we'll see.

Neil approaches Todd, who's been sitting by the window staring down at the

floor. Neil snaps his fingers to get Todd's attention. 

				NEIL

		Hey, you coming to the study group tonight?

				TODD

		Uh, no, no I, uh, I've got some history I

		wanna do.

				NEIL

		Suit yourself.

INT. TODD'S ROOM - EVENING

Todd is seated at his desk. He scrawls "CARPE DIEM" across a blank page

of his notebook. He looks at it for a few moments before crumpling it up

and opening up his Chemistry book.

INT. ENTRANCEWAY - NIGHT

Hager comes down the stairs. Knox is looking at one of the old class photos

on the walls.

				HAGER

		Ready Overstreet?

Knox reluctantly follows after Dr. Hager.

				KNOX

		Ready to go sir.

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

The car leaves Welton and drives towards the Danburry's house.

INT / EXT DANBURRY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The doorbell rings.

				MRS DANBURRY (O.S.)

		Chet, can you get that?

				CHET (O.S.)

		I can't, Mom.

				CHRIS (O.S.)

		I'll get it.

The door opens and Knox is awe-struck by the beautiful girl (CHRIS) who

has answered the door.

				CHRIS

		Can I help you?

Knox manages to break out of his daze.

				KNOX

		Hi. Knox Overstreet. Uh, Dr. Hager.

				CHRIS

		Hi.

				KNOX

		This is the Danburry's, right?

				CHRIS

		Are you here to see Chet?

				KNOX

		Mrs. Danburry?

Chris begins to laugh as Mrs. Danburry arrives behind her.

				CHRIS

		No.

				MRS DANBURRY

		Sorry. Thank you Chris. I'm Mrs. Danburry.

		You must be Knox.

				KNOX

		Yes.

				MRS DANBURRY

			    (to Dr. Hager)

		Back by nine.

			    (to Knox)

		Please come in.

				CHET (O.S.)

		Chris, come on, what are you doing?

				CHRIS

		Chet, I'm coming.

Knox enters the house, his mind still hung up on Chris as MR DANBURRY

comes out of the living room to meet him.

				MR DANBURRY

		Knox. How are you? Joe Danburry.

				KNOX

		Nice to meet you sir.

				MR DANBURRY

		Well he's the spitting image of his father,

		isn't he. How is he? Come on in.

				CHET (O.S.)

		Chris!

				KNOX

		He's great. He just did a big case for GM.

				CHRIS (O.S.)

		I'm coming.

				MR DANBURRY

		I know where you're headed, like father

		like son, huh?

INT. STUDENT LOUNGE - NIGHT

Several students are throwing darts at a small rubber skeleton hanging

from the bulletin board. Various students are studying and playing games.

Meeks and Pitts are sitting at one table working on their "hi-fi system".

Meeks is waving an antenna around with no luck. Pitts points out to him

that he forgot to plug it in. Neil, Cameron, and Charlie are working on

their trig homework.

				CAMERON

		Just replace these numbers here with "x",

		for "x" and "y".

				NEIL

		Of course.

				CAMERON

		Of course, so what's the problem?

Charlie enters the room and closes the door behind him, leaning up

against it heavily.

				CHARLIE

		How was dinner?

				KNOX

		Huh?

				CHARLIE

		How was dinner?

				KNOX

		Terrible. Awful.

He leaves the door and sits down with the other boys.

				CHARLIE

		Why? What happened?

				KNOX

		Tonight, I met the most beautiful girl

		in my entire life.

				NEIL

		Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?

				KNOX

		She's practically engaged. To Chet Danburry.

				CHARLIE

		That guy could eat a football.

				PITTS

		That's too bad.

				KNOX

		Too bad? It's worse than too bad Pitsie,

		it's a tragedy. A girl this beautiful in

		love with such a jerk.

				PITTS

		All the good ones go for jerks, you

		know that.

				CAMERON

		Ahh, forget her. Open your trig book and

		try and figure out problem five.

				KNOX

		I can't just forget her Cameron. And I

		can't think about trig.

The radio Meeks and Pitts were working on begins letting out a high

pitched hum.

				PITTS

		We got it.

				MEEKS

		Holy cow.

Mr. Hager walks into the room.

				HAGER

		All right gentlemen, five minutes. Let's

		go.

The students quickly pack up their gear and prepare to leave. Pitts tries

to hide the radio in his lap. Charlie leans in close to Knox.

				CHARLIE

		Did you see her naked?

				KNOX

		Very funny Dalton.

				HAGER

		That wouldn't be a radio in your lap,

		would it Mr. Pitts?

				PITTS

		No sir. Science experiment, radar.

Meeks holds up the antenna as if demonstrating it.

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

Keating sits at his desk at the front of the classroom and opens up one

of his books.

				KEATING

		Gentlemen, open your text to page

		twenty-one of the introduction. Mr.

		Perry, will you read the opening

		paragraph of the preface, entitled

		"Understanding Poetry"?

				NEIL

		Understanding Poetry, by Dr. J. Evans

		Pritchard, Ph.D. To fully understand

		poetry, we must first be fluent with

		its meter, rhyme, and figures of speech.

		Then ask two questions: One, how artfully

		has the objective of the poem been

		rendered, and two, how important is that

		objective. Question one rates the poem's

		perfection, question two rates its

		importance. And once these questions have

		been answered, determining a poem's

		greatest becomes a relatively simple

		matter.

Keating gets up from his desk and prepares to draw on the chalk board.

				NEIL

		If the poem's score for perfection is

		plotted along the horizontal of a graph,

		and its importance is plotted on the

		vertical, then calculating the total

		area of the poem yields the measure of

		its greatness.

Keating draws a corresponding graph on the board and the students

dutifully copy it down.

				NEIL

		A sonnet by Byron may score high on the

		vertical, but only average on the

		horizontal. A Shakespearean sonnet, on

		the other hand, would score high both

		horizontally and vertically, yielding a

		massive total area, thereby revealing the

		poem to be truly great. As you proceed

		through the poetry in this book, practice

		this rating method. As your ability to

		evaluate poems in this matter grows, so

		will - so will your enjoyment and

		understanding of poetry.

Neil sets the book down and takes off his glasses. The student sitting

across from him is discretely trying to eat. Keating turns away from

the chalkboard with a smile.

				KEATING

		Excrement. That's what I think of Mr. J.

		Evans Pritchard. We're not laying pipe,

		we're talking about poetry.

Cameron looks down at the graph he copied into his notes and quickly

scribbles it out.

				KEATING

		I mean, how can you describe poetry like

		American Bandstand? I like Byron, I give

		him a 42, but I can't dance to it.

Charlie suddenly appear to become interested in the class.

				KEATING

		Now I want you to rip out that page.

The students look at Keating as if he has just gone mad.

				KEATING

		Go on, rip out the entire page. You heard

		me, rip it out. Rip it out!

Charlie looks around at the others. He then looks down at his own notes,

which consists of drawing breasts.

				KEATING

		Go on, rip it out.

Charlie rips the page out and holds it up.

				KEATING

		Thank you Mr. Dalton. Gentlemen, tell you

		what, don't just tear out that page, tear

		out the entire introduction. I want it

		gone, history. Leave nothing of it. Rip

		it out. Rip! Begone J. Evans Pritchard,

		Ph.D. Rip, shred, tear. Rip it out. I

		want to hear nothing but ripping of Mr.

		Pritchard.

Meeks looks around reluctantly and then finally begins tearing out pages.

				KEATING

		We'll perforate it, put it on a roll.

Keating sees Cameron still hesitating.

				KEATING

		It's not the bible, you're not going to

		go to hell for this. Go on, make a clean

		tear, I want nothing left of it.

Keating goes over to his room. Cameron turns around to Neil.

				CAMERON

		We shouldn't be doing this.

				NEIL

		Rip, rip, rip!

Neil makes Cameron turn back around.

				KEATING (O.S.)

		Rip it out, rip!

From outside the classroom, Mr. McAllister hears all the noise and sees

all the students ripping out the pages. He bursts into the room.

				MCALLISTER

		What the hell is going on here?

The boys all turn around in shock. Charlie stuffs a crumpled page into his

mouth. Keating emerges from his room with a waste paper basket.

				KEATING

		I don't hear enough rips.

				MCALLISTER

		Mr. Keating.

				KEATING

		Mr. McAllister.

				MCALLISTER

		I'm sorry, I- I didn't know you were

		here.

				KEATING

		I am.

				MCALLISTER

		Ahh, so you are. Excuse me.

Mr. McAllister slowly backs out of the classroom.

				KEATING

		Keep ripping gentlemen. This is a battle,

		a war. And the casualties could be your

		hearts and souls. 

Keating holds out the basket to Charlie who spits out a wad of paper.

				KEATING

		Thank you Mr. Dalton. Armies of academics

		going forward, measuring poetry. No, we

		will not have that here. No more of Mr.

		J. Evans Pritchard. Now in my class you

		will learn to think for yourselves again.

		You will learn to savor words and language.

		No matter what anybody tells you, words and

		ideas can change the world. I see that look

		in Mr. Pitt's eye, like nineteenth century

		literature has nothing to do with going to

		business school or medical school. Right?

		Maybe. Mr. Hopkins, you may agree with him, 

		thinking "Yes, we should simply study our

		Mr. Pritchard and learn our rhyme and meter

		and go quietly about the business of

		achieving other ambitions." I have a little

		secret for ya. Huddle up. Huddle up! 

The boys get up from their seats and gather around Keating in the center

of the class.

				KEATING

		We don't read and write poetry because

		it's cute. We read and write poetry

		because we are members of the human race.

		And the human race is filled with passion.

		Medicine, law, business, engineering,

		these are all noble pursuits, and necessary

		to sustain life. But poetry, beauty,

		romance, love, these are what we stay alive

		for. To quote from Whitman: "O me, o life

		of the questions of these recurring, of the

		endless trains of the faithless, of cities

		filled with the foolish. What good amid

		these, o me, o life? Answer: that you are

		here. That life exists, and identity.

		That the powerful play goes on, and you

		may contribute a verse. That the powerful

		play goes on and you may contribute a verse.

Keating looks up at Todd.

				Keating

		What will your verse be?

INT. HEAD OF CAFETERIA - DAY

The cafeteria is filled with students and teachers standing before the tables saying grace.

				ALL

		For what we are about to receive, may the

		Lord make us truly grateful. Amen.

Mr. Keating and Mr. McAllister are seated next to one another at the table.

				MCALLISTER

		Quite an interesting class you gave today,

		Mr. Keating.

				KEATING

		I'm sorry if I shocked you, Mr. McAllister.

				MCALLISTER

		Oh, there's no need to apologize. It was

		very fascinating, misguided though it was.

				KEATING

		You think so?

				MCALLISTER

		You take a big risk by encouraging them to

		be artists John. When they realize they're

		not Rembrandts, Shakespeares or Mozarts,

		they'll hate you for it.

				KEATING

		We're not talking artists George, we're

		talking free thinkers.

				MCALLISTER

		Free thinkers at seventeen?

				KEATING

		Funny, I never pegged you as a cynic.

				MCALLISTER

			  (taken aback by the comment)

		Not a cynic, a realist. Show me the heart

		unfettered by foolish dreams, and I'll

		show you a happy man.

				KEATING

		But only in their dreams can man be truly

		free. 'Twas always thus, and always thus

		will be.

				MCALLISTER

		Tennyson?

				KEATING

		No, Keating.

Keating winks and Mr. McAllister can't help but laugh.

INT. CAFETERIA TABLE - DAY

Neil joins the others at the table. He pulls out a yearbook.

				NEIL

		Hey, I found his senior annual in the

		library.

He hands the annual over to Cameron who laughs at the younger picture of Keating.

				NEIL

		Listen to this, captain of the soccer team,

		editor of the school annual, Cambridge

		bound, Thigh man, and the Dead Poets Society.

				CAMERON

			    (reading from the annual)

		Man most likely to do anything.

				CHARLIE

		Thigh man. Mr. K was a hell-raiser.

				KNOX

		What's the Dead Poets Society?

				NEIL

		I don't know.

				MEEKS

		Is there a picture in the annual?

				NEIL

		Nothing. No other mention of it.

				MR. NOLAN (O.S.)

		That boy there, see me after lunch.

Cameron quickly puts the annual away and the others all return to their meal.

EXT. WELTON GROUNDS - DAY

Keating is walking down towards the lake, whistling the same tune as before.

The boys emerge from the building and chase after him.

				NEIL

		Mr. Keating? Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain,

		My Captain?

Keating immediately turns around.

				KEATING

		Gentlemen.

				NEIL

		We were just looking in your old annual.

He hands Keating the annual and Keating looks at his old photograph.

				KEATING

		Oh my God. No, that's not me. Stanley

		"The Tool" Wilson-

Keating crouches down and continues looking through the book.

				KEATING

		God.

Neil crouches down next to Keating.

				NEIL

		What was the Dead Poets Society?

				KEATING

		I doubt the present administration would

		look too favorably upon that.

				NEIL

		Why? What was it?

				KEATING

		Gentlemen, can you keep a secret?

				NEIL

		Sure.

The other boys crouch down around Keating.

				KEATING

		The Dead Poets were dedicated to sucking

		the marrow out of life. That's a phrase

		from Thoreau that we'd invoke at the

		beginning of each meeting. You see we'd

		gather at the old Indian cave and take

		turns reading from Thoreau, Whitman,

		Shelley; the biggies. Even some of our

		own verse. And in the enchantment of the

		moment we'd let poetry work its magic.

				KNOX

		You mean it was a bunch of guys sitting

		around reading poetry?

				KEATING

		No Mr. Overstreet, it wasn't just "guys",

		we weren't a Greek organization, we were

		romantics. We didn't just read poetry,

		we let it drip from our tongues like honey.

		Spirits soared, women swooned, and gods

		were created, gentlemen, not a bad way to

		spend an evening eh? Thank you Mr. Perry

		for this trip down amnesia lane. Burn that,

		especially my picture.

Keating hands the annual back and walks away, whistling once again. Neil

remains crouched.

				NEIL

		Dead Poets Society.

				CAMERON

		What?

The school bells begin ringing and everyone heads back towards the school.

Neil stands up.

				NEIL

		I say we go tonight.

				CHARLIE

		Tonight?

				CAMERON

		Wait a minute.

				PITTS

		Where's this cave he's talking about?

				NEIL

		It's beyond the stream. I know where it

		is.

				PITTS

		That's miles.

				CAMERON

		Sounds boring to me.

				CHARLIE

		Don't go.

				CAMERON

		You know how many de-merits we're talking

		Dalton

				CHARLIE

		So don't come, please.

				CAMERON

		Look, all I'm saying is that we have to

		be careful, we can't get caught.

				CHARLIE

		No shit, Sherlock.

				HAGER

				(yelling)

		You boys there, hurry up.

Neil turns around and faces the other boys.

				NEIL

		All right, who's in?

				CAMERON

		Come on Neil, Hager's right-

				NEIL

		Forget Hager, no. Who's in?

				CHARLIE

		I'm in.

				HAGER (O.S.)

		I'm warning you, move.

				CAMERON

		Me too.

				PITTS

		I don't know Neil

				NEIL

		What? Pitts-

				CHARLIE

		Pitsie, come on.

				MEEKS

		His grades are hurting Charlie.

				NEIL

		You can help him Meeks.

				PITTS

		What is this, a midnight study group?

				NEIL

		Forget it Pitts, you're coming. Meeks,

		are your grades hurting too?

				MEEKS

		I'll try anything once.

				CHARLIE

		Except sex.

				MEEKS

		Ha ha ha.

				CAMERON

		I mean as long as we're careful.

The boys run into the building.

				CHARLIE

		What about you Knox?

				KNOX

		I don't know Charlie.

				CHARLIE

		Come on Knox, it'll help you get Chris.

				KNOX

		Yeah? How?

				CHARLIE

		Women swoon.

Charlie laughs and runs inside. Knox chases after him.

				KNOX

		But why do they swoon? Charlie, tell me

		why they swoon. Charlie!

INT LIBRARY - DAY

The boys are all gathered around one of the tables with a map laid out

on it.

				NEIL

			    (whispering)

		Okay, follow the stream to the waterfall.

		It's right there. It's got to be on the

		banks.

				CAMERON

		I don't know, it's starting to sound

		dangerous.

				CHARLIE

		Well, why don't you stay home?

				MCALLISTER

		For God's sake stop chattering and

		sit down.

The boys take their seats once again and Neil goes over and sits next to

Todd, who is sitting by himself.

				NEIL

		Todd, are you coming tonight?

				TODD

		No.

				NEIL

		Why not? God, you were there. You heard

		Keating. Don't you want to do something

		about it?

				TODD

		Yes, but-

				NEIL

		But? But what?

				TODD

		Keating said that everybody took turns

		reading and I don't want to do that.

				NEIL

		Gosh, you really have a problem with

		that, don't you?

				TODD

		N- no, I don't have a problem. Neil,

		I just- I just don't want to do it,

		okay?

				NEIL

		All right. What if you didn't have to

		read? What if you just came and

		listened?

				TODD

		That's not how it works.

				NEIL

		Forget how it works. What if - what if

		they said it was okay?

				TODD

		What? What are you gonna do, go up and

		ask them?

Neil shrugs.

				TODD

		No. No, Neil.

				NEIL

		I'll be right back.

				TODD

		Neil, Neil!

Neil gets up and rejoins the others. McAllister hears the boys whispering

again.

				MCALLISTER

		Oh shut up, will you.

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT

Various boys are crowded around the sinks getting ready for bed. Someone

is playing snake charmer music on a kazoo while someone else is bothering

Spaz with a red sock puppet acting like a snake.

				SPAZ

		That's my- that's for my asthma, okay.

		Could you give that back please? Could

		you give that back?

				BOY

		What's the matter? Don't you like snakes?

Neil enters and taps Todd on the shoulder.

				NEIL

		You're in.

				SPAZ

		Get away from me, okay?

				BOY

		Spaz, why don't you check your pocket,

		huh? Come on Spaz I have to brush my

		teeth

				SPAZ

		Get a- get off, 

Hager walks past the bathroom and into his room.

				HAGER

		Cut out that racket in there.

The kazoo player lets out a rude squeek before finally stopping. Hager

glares at them for a moment.

INT NEIL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Neil stands in his doorway. He looks across the hall to the other room

where Cameron and Charlie are standing. Cameron gives a thumbs up. Neil

closes his room door and takes out his cloak and a flashlight. Setting

the flashlight down on the desk, he notices a worn book, "Five

Centuries of Verse", sitting there. Opening it up, he sees John Keating's

name at the top followed by "Dead Poets". Below the title of the book,

is written: "To Be Read At The Opening of D.P.S. Meetings." Along with

several lines from Thoreau, beginning with "I went to the woods because

I wanted to live deliberately..."

INT STAIRWAY - NIGHT

The shadows of hooded figures can be seen moving throughout the darkened

halls.

INT HAGER'S ROOM - NIGHT

Hager hears a dog barking.

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Someone drops a number of dog biscuits by the dog's feet. He stops

barking and immediately begins gobbling them down. Hager looks out

into the hallway with his flashlight but sees nothing.

EXT SCHOOL GROUNDS - NIGHT

The boys quietly leave the building and set off running across the

fields towards the woods.

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

The boys search about the trees trying to find the cave. Meeks is

searching around when Charlie leaps up behind Meeks in the dark

shining the flashlight up at his own face and grabs Meeks by the

shoulder.

				CHARLIE

		Arrr, I'm a dead poet.

				MEEKS

		Aww, Charlie.

				CHARLIE

			    (laughing)

		Guys, over here.

				MEEKS

		You're funny. You're real funny.

INT CAVE - NIGHT

The boys are trying to start a fire. The cave is quickly filling up with

smoke.

				MEEKS

		It's too wet.

CHARLIE

		God, are you trying to smoke us out of

		here?

				MEEKS

		No, no, the smoke's going right up this

		opening.

Pitts tries to stand up and slams his head into the low rock ceiling. He

lets out a yell while the others laugh.

				NEIL

		You okay?

				PITTS

		Oh God. Clowns.

				NEIL

		All right, all right, forget the fire.

		Let's go gentlemen.

Neil stands before the others with the book in hand, and takes a drag

on a cigarette.

				NEIL

		I hereby reconvene the Dead Poets

		Society.

The boys cheer.

				NEIL

		Welton chapter. The meetings will be

		conducted by myself and the other new

		initiates now present. Todd Anderson,

		because he prefers not to read, will

		keep minutes of the meetings. I'll now

		read the traditional opening message by

		society member Henry David Thoreau. "I

		went to the woods because I wanted to

		live deliberately. I wanted to live deep

		and suck out all the marrow of life."

				CHARLIE

		I'll second that.

				NEIL

		"To put to rout all that was not life,

		and not, when I had come to die,

		discover that I had not lived.

Several boys whistle softly in reaction to the poem.

				NEIL

		And Keating's marked a bunch of other

		pages.

Neil begins flipping through the book.

				CHARLIE

		All right, intermission. Dig deep right

		here. Right here, lay it down

				CAMERON

		On the mud? We're gonna put our food on

		the mud?

				CHARLIE

		Meeks, put your coat down. Picnic blanket.

				MEEKS

		Yes sir, use Meeks' coat.

				CHARLIE

		Don't keep anything back either. You

		guys are always bumming my smokes.

Meeks lays his coat down and everyone dumps their food on it. Amongst

the pile are chocolate chip cookies, a box of raisins, a few apples, an

orange, and half a roll.

				NEIL

		Raisins?

				KNOX

		Yuck.

				CHARLIE

		Wait a minute, who gave us half a roll?

				PITTS

			  (talking with his mouth full)

		I'm eating the other half.

				CHARLIE

		Come on.

				PITTS

		You want me to put it back?

INT CAVE - NIGHT

Neil, lit up by a flashlight, begins to tell everyone a story.

				NEIL

		It was a dark and rainy night, and this

		old lady, who had a passion for jigsaw

		puzzles, sat by herself in her house at

		her table to complete a new jigsaw puzzle.

		But as she pieced the puzzle together, she

		realized, to her astonishment, that the

		image that was formed was her very own

		room. And the figure in the center of the

		puzzle, as she completed it, was herself.

		And with trembling hands, she placed the

		last four pieces and stared in horror at

		the face of a demented madman at the

		window. The last thing that this old lady

		ever heard was the sound of breaking glass.

				BOYS

		Ohhh... no...

				NEIL

		This is true, this is true.

				CAMERON

		I've got one that's even better than

		that.

				CHARLIE

		Ha!

				CAMERON

		I do. There's a young, married couple,

		and they're driving through the forest

		at night on a long trip. And they run

		out of gas, and there's a madman on the-

				CHARLIE

		The thing with the hand-

All the boys react, recalling the story and miming the scraping on the

roof of the car.

				CAMERON

		I love that story.

				CHARLIE

		I told you that one.

				CAMERON

		You did not. I got that in camp in

		sixth grade.

				CHARLIE

		When were you in six, last year?

As everyone's voices begin to calm down, Pitts begins reading from the

book.

				PITTS

		"In a mean abode in the shanking road,

		lived a man named William Bloat. Now,

		he had a wife, the plague of his life,

		who continually got his goat. And one

		day at dawn, with her nightshift on,

		he slit her bloody throat."

The boys laugh.

				PITTS

		Oh, and it gets worse.

				CHARLIE

		You want to hear a real poem?

Meeks hands Charlie the book but he shoves it away.

				CHARLIE

		All right? No, I don't need it. You take 

		it. 

				MEEKS

		What, did you bring one? 

				NEIL

		You memorized a poem? 

				CHARLIE

		I didn't memorize a poem. Move up.

Neil moves to the side as Charlie stands and takes his spot.

				MEEKS

		An original piece by Charlie Dalton. 

				KNOX

		An original piece. 

				PITTS

		Take center stage. 

				NEIL

		You know this is history. Right? This is 

		history.

Charlie clears his throat and pulls out a page from a magazine and 

slowly unfolds it, revealing a Playboy centerfold (Elaine Reynolds,

Miss October, 1959)

				MEEKS

		Oh, wow. 

				CAMERON

		Where did you get that? 

				CHARLIE

		Teach me to love? Go teach thyself more 

		wit.

		I, chief professor, am of it.

Neil gets up and looks over Charlie's shoulder to see what he is

reading.

				CHARLIE

		The god of love, if such a thing there 

		be, may learn to love from me.

Charlie winks at the guys and they clap and cheer.

				NEIL

		Wow! Did you write that?

Charlie turns over the centerfold to show where he had written down

the poem.

				CHARLIE

		Abraham Cowley. Okay, who's next? 

Neil sits reading from the book by flashlight.

				NEIL

		Alfred Lord Tennyson. 

		Come my friends, 

		'Tis not too late to seek a newer world 

		for my purpose holds to sail beyond the 

		sunset. 

		And though we are not now that strength 

		which in old days 

		Moved earth and heaven; that which we 

		are, we are;-- 

		One equal temper of heroic hearts, 

		Made weak by time and fate, but strong 

		in will. 

		To strive, to seek, to find, and not to 

		yield. 

Meeks takes center stage and begins reading a poem like he is 

performing a chant.

				MEEKS

		Then I had religion, then I had a 

		vision. 

		I could not turn from their revel in 

		derision. 

		Then I saw the Congo creeping through 

		the black, 

		cutting through the forest with a golden 

		track. 

		Then I saw the Congo creeping through 

		the black- 

				CHARLIE

		Meeks, Meeks. 

				MEEKS

		...cutting through the forest with a 

		golden track.

		Then I saw the Congo creeping through 

		the black, 

		cutting through the forest with a golden 

		track.

Knox picks up a metal container and begins using it as a drum. The

other boys stand and begin going in a circle, making music with

sticks of wood, combs, etc.

		Then I saw the Congo creeping through 

		the black, 

		cutting through the forest with a golden 

		track. 

		Then I saw the Congo creeping through 

		the black, 

		cutting through the forest with a golden 

		track. 

				BOYS

		Then I saw the Congo creeping through 

		the black, 

		cutting through the forest with...

The boys continue to chant the chorus as they emerge from the

cave.

EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT

The clock tolls two as the boys silently run back to their dorm.

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

Keating is walking to the front of the classroom filled with students.

				KEATING

		A man is not very tire, he is exhausted.

		And don't use very sad, use-

He points to the back of the classroom.

				KEATING

		Come on, Mr. Overstreet, you twerp, 

				KNOX

		Morose? 

				KEATING

		Exactly! Morose. Now, language was 

		developed for one endeavor, and that is? 

		Mr. Anderson? Come on! Are you a man or 

		an amoeba?

Keating stands before Todd's desk. Todd looks up nervously but

says nothing. Keating paused for a moment before looking away.

				KEATING

		Mr. Perry? 

				NEIL

		Uh, to communicate. 

				KEATING

		No! To woo women. Today we're going to 

		be talking about William Shakespeare. 

The class lets out a collective sigh.

				BOY

		Oh, God! 

				KEATING

		I know. A lot of you looked forward to 

		this about as much as you look forward 

		to root canal work. We're gonna talk 

		about Shakespeare as someone who writes 

		something very interesting. Now, many of 

		you have seen Shakespeare done very much 

		like this:

Keating holds out his right arm dramtically and begins to

speak in an exaggerated British accent.

		"O Titus, bring your friend hither." But

		if any of you have seen Mr. Marlon Brando,

		you know, Shakespeare can be different. 

		"Friend, Romans, countrymen, lend me your

		ears." You can also imagine, maybe, John

		Wayne as Macbeth going, "Well, is this a 

		dagger I see before me?"

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

The students are all seated together near the front of the room as

Keating reads from a book.

				KEATING

		"Dogs, sir? Oh, not just now. I do enjoy 

		a good dog once in a while, sir. You can 

		have yourself a three-course meal from 

		one dog. Start with your canine 

		crudites, go to your Fido flambe for 

		main course and for dessert, a Pekingese 

		parfait. And you can pick your teeth 

		with a little paw."

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

The students are all back in their normal seats and Keating leaps

up onto his desk.

				KEATING

		Why do I stand up here? Anybody? 

				CHARLIE

		To feel taller. 

				KEATING

		No!

Keating rings the bell on his desk with his foot

				KEATING

		Thank you for playing, Mr. Dalton. I 

		stand upon my desk to remind yourself 

		that we must constantly look at things 

		in a different way. 

Keating glances around the classroom from atop the desk.

				KEATING

		You see, the world looks very different 

		from up here. You don't believe me? Come 

		see for yourself. Come on. Come on! 

Charlie and Neil quickly rise from their seats to go to the front

of the classroom. The rest of the class follows them. While Keating

continues speaking, Neil and Charlie join him on the desk and then

Keating jumps down.

				KEATING

		Just when you think you know something, 

		you have to look at it in another way. 

		Even though it may seem silly or wrong, 

		you must try! Now, when you read, don't 

		just consider what the author thinks. 

		Consider what you think. 

				KEATING

		Boys, you must strive to find your own 

		voice. Because the longer you wait to 

		begin, the less likely you are to find 

		it at all. Thoreau said, "Most men lead 

		lives of quiet desperation." Don't be 

		resigned to that. Break out!

Keating notices Spaz and another boy leaving the desk immediately.

				KEATING

		Don't just walk off the edge like lemmings.

		Look around you. 

The school bell rings as the boys continue to climb onto the desk.

Keating begins to gather up his stuff. The clock begins to toll as

Keating walks to the back of the class.

				KEATING

		There! There you go, Mr. Priske. Thank 

		you! Yes! Dare to strike out and find 

		new ground. Now, in addition to your 

		essays, I would like you to compose a 

		poem of your own, an original work.

The students begin to groan. Keating begins flickering the lights

off and on while chanting ominously.

				KEATING

		That's right! You have to deliver it 

		aloud in front of the class on Monday. 

		Bonne chance, gentlemen. 

Keating steps out into the hall before quickly peeking back in once again.

Todd is the last one to stand on the desk and is about to jump off.

				KEATING

		Mr. Anderson? Don't think that I don't 

		know that this assignment scares the 

		hell out of you, you mole.

Keating flicks the light off, leaving Todd to jump down in the darkness

as the students laugh.

EXT. RIVER - DAY

Cameron, Charlie, and several other boys are rowing while Mr. Nolan

shouts orders from a bullhorn.

				MR. NOLAN

		Take a power train in two! Three! Keep 

		your eyes in the boat!

EXT. CAMPUS ROOFTOP - DAY

Noisy static is replaced by music as Pitts climbs down form the peak to

join Meeks at their makeshift radio.

				MEEKS

		We got it, Pittsie. We got it! Radio 

		Free America! 

EXT CAMPUS - DAY

Several students are fencing on a grassy slope.

EXT. CAMPUS ROOFTOP - DAY

Meeks and Pitts perform a goofy dance together to the music.

INT. TODD'S ROOM - DAY

Todd is on his bed trying to write a poem. The door opens and Todd

turns his writing pad over. Neil enters the room laughing. He crouches

down next to Todd's bed and plunks a sheet of paper in Todd's lap.

				NEIL

		I found it. 

				TODD

		You found what? 

				NEIL

		What I wanna do right now. What's 

		really, really inside me. 

				TODD

		"A Midsummer Night's Dream"? 

				NEIL

		This is it. 

				TODD

		What is this? 

				NEIL

		It's a play, dummy. 

				TODD

		I know that. I-- Wh-Wh-What does it have 

		to do with you? 

				NEIL

		Right. They're putting it on at Henley 

		Hall. Open tryouts. Open tryouts! 

				TODD

		Yes, so?

Neil pounds on the bed and then pulls a blanket off his bed,

wearing it like a cloak.

				NEIL

		So, I'm gonna act. Yes, yes! I'm gonna 

		be an actor! Ever since I can remember, 

		I've wanted to try this. I even tried to 

		go to summer stock auditions last year, 

		but, of course, my father wouldn't let 

		me. For the first time in my whole life 

		I know what I wanna do.

Neil grabs a handful of papers off Todd's bed and tosses them into

the air.

				NEIL

		and for the first time I'm gonna do it 

		whether my father wants me to or not!

		Carpe diem! 

				TODD

		Neil, Neil, hold on a minute. How are 

		you gonna be in a play if your father 

		won't let you? 

				NEIL

		First I gotta get the part, then I can 

		worry about that. 

				TODD

		Yeah, but won't he kill you if he finds 

		out you went to an audition and didn't 

		even tell him? 

				NEIL

		No, no, no, no. As far as I'm concerned, 

		he won't have to know about any of this. 

				TODD

		Well, that's impossible. 

				NEIL

		Bullshit! Nothing's impossible. 

				TODD

		Well, why don't you just call him and 

		ask him? And m-maybe he'll say yes. 

				NEIL

		That's a laugh!

Neil tosses the blanket back onto his bed.

				NEIL

		If I don't ask him, at least I won't

		be disobeying him. 

				TODD

		Yeah, but if he said-- 

				NEIL

			   (shouting angrily)

		Jesus, Todd! Whose side are you on?

Todd says nothing. Neil looks at him for a moment and then takes

the flyer back from Todd. He walks over to the window, his 

excitement gone.

				NEIL

		I mean, I haven't even gotten the part 

		yet. Can't I even enjoy the idea for a 

		little while? 

Once again, Todd says nothing. After a moment, Neil sits on the

heater and Todd returns to his poem.

				NEIL

		You're coming to the meeting this 

		afternoon? 

				TODD

		I don't know. Maybe.

				NEIL

		Nothing Mr. Keating has to say means 

		shit to you, does it, Todd? 

				TODD

		W-What is that supposed to mean? 

				NEIL

		You're in the club! Being in the club 

		means being stirred up by things. You 

		look about as stirred up as a cesspool. 

Neil gets up from the window and stands over Todd.

				TODD

		So- You want me out? 

				NEIL

		No! I want you in, but being in means 

		you gotta do something. Not just say 

		you're in. 

				TODD

		Well, listen, Neil. I-I appreciate this 

		concern, but I-I'm not like you. All 

		right? You, you, you say thing and 

		people listen. I'm, I'm not like that. 

				NEIL

		Don't you think you could be? 

				TODD

		No! I--I, I don't know, but that's not 

		the point. The, the, the point is that 

		there's nothing you can do about it, so 

		you can just butt out. I can take care 

		of myself just fine. All right? 

				NEIL

		No. 

				TODD

		What do you mean, "no"? 

A smile comes to Neil's face.

				NEIL

		No. 

Neil grabs Todd's notebook of poetry and runs across the room with 

it. Todd leaps up after him.

				TODD

		Give me-- Neil. Neil, give that back. 

The two begin racing in circles around the room, jumping from

bed to bed as Todd tries to grab his poem back.

				NEIL

		"We are dreaming of a--" Poetry! I'm 

		being chased by Walt Whitman! Okay, 

		okay.

Neil drops the notebook. Cameron walks into the room.

				CAMERON

		What are you guys doing? I'm sure-- You 

		see this chemistry-

Cameron tries to hold up his book and Neil snatches it from his hands and

suddenly all three of them are racing around the room.

				CAMERON

		Hey, give me-- Neil, give me-- Don't be

		immature. Come on. I need my- 

Charlie enters the room and begins waving his hands.

				CHARLIE

		Give it to me! Give it to me! 

				NEIL

		Charlie!

Neil tosses Cameron's book to Charlie.

				CAMERON

		Let me have my book, I need my- 

The four boys continue racing around the cramped quarters, tossing

Cameron's book back and forth. Neil picks up a recorder and begins

blowing erratic notes on it while Charlie starts pounding on a set of

bongo drums. Outside the room a crowd of boys watch.

EXT. CAMPUS ENTRANCE - DAY

Knox is riding his bike around in circles near the entrance. Seeing no

one nearby, he races through the open gates and down the road. He comes

to the top of a hill and then goes downhill across the grass, shouting

as he sends an immense flock of geese flying into the air.

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

A number of vehicles drive up, filled with students dressed in bright red

cosyumes, playing trumpets and various other instruments as they pass.

Knox watches the growing crowd of students. They are all converging on

a bus. A football player, wearing a horned helmet, dances on the roof of

the bus. A band is playing while a group of cheerleaders are practising.

Knox spots Chris amongst the cheerleaders. He watches her until Chet

comes along and she grabs hold of his hand. Knox looks away in disgust.

				COACH

		Okay, everybody on the bus. Let's go, 

		boys. Come on, let's go. On the bus, 

		boys. Now!

Chris jumps into Chet's arms as everyone begins to board the buses. Knox

turns his bike around and leaves.

EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY

Keating walks across the field, followed by his students. He kicks a ball

ahead of him while he carries a number of other balls in a net slung over

his shoulder.

				KEATING

		Now, devotees may argue that one sport 

		or game is inherently better than 

		another. For me, sport is actually a 

		chance for us to have other human beings 

		push us to excel. I want you all to come 

		over here and take a slip of paper and 

		line up single file.

Keating reaches the stands. He tosses the balls aside and pulls sets

his briefcase down. As the boys line up he begins ripping off slips

of paper from a notepad and handing them out.

				KEATING

		Mr. Meeks, time to inherit the earth. 

		Mr. Pitts, rise above your name.

He hands the notepad to another student.

				KEATING

		I want you to hand these out to the boys,

		one apiece.

EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY

The students are all lined up in single file, each holding a slip

of paper. Keating blows his whistle.

				KEATING

		You know what to do, Pitts. 

				PITTS

		"Oh to struggle against great odds. To 

		meet enemies undaunted." 

				KEATING

		Sounds to me like you're daunted. Say it 

		again like you're undaunted. 

				PITTS

		"Oh to struggle against great odds. To 

		meet enemies undaunted." 

				KEATING

		Now go on.

Pitts gives one of the soccer balls a good kick.

				KEATING

		Yes! Next.

One of the students sets up the next ball as the line advances.

				BOY 1

		"To be a sailor of the world, bound for 

		all ports." 

				KEATING

		Next. Louder! 

				BOY 2

		"Oh, I live to be the ruler of life, not 

		a slave." 

Keating walks away and starts up a record player.

				BOY 3

		"To mount the scaffolds. To advance to 

		the muzzle of guns with perfect 

		nonchalance."

Classical music begins playing on the phonograph. Meeks goes to

read next but is confused by the music.

				KEATING

		Come on, Meeks! Listen to the music. 

				MEEKS

		"To dance, clap hands, exalt, shout, 

		skip, roll on, float on." 

				KEATING

		Yes! 

				HOPKINS

				(without energy)

		"Oh, to have life henceforth the poem of 

		new joys." 

Hopkins crumples up his paper and then barely taps the soccer

ball with his foot.

Keating puts a look of disgust on his face.

				KEATING

		Oh! Boo! Come on, Charlie, let it fill 

		your soul! 

Charlie raises his hands over his head.

				CHARLIE

		"To indeed be a god!" 

INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY

Neil is racing down the hallway, all excited.

				NEIL

		Charlie, I got the part! I'm gonna play 

		Puck! I'm gonna play Puck!

He pounds on Charlie's door.

				MEEKS

		What did he say? 

				PITTS

		Puck? 

				NEIL

		That's the main part. 

				KNOX

		Great, Neil. 

				NEIL

		Charlie, I got it! 

				CHARLIE

		Congratulations. Good for you, Neil. 

		Good for you. 

Neil enters his room with Todd and sits down at his typewriter.

				NEIL

		Okay, okay, okay, okay. 

				TODD

		Neil, how are you gonna do this? 

				NEIL

		They need a letter of permission from my 

		father and Mr. Nolan. 

				TODD

		You're not gonna write it. 

				NEIL

		Oh yes, I am. 

				TODD

		Oh, Neil. Neil, you're crazy. 

 Neil begins typing.

				    NEIL

		Okay. "I am writing to you on behalf of 

		my son Neil Perry."

Neil begins laughing and stomping his feet up and down.

				    NEIL

		This is great.

EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT

A lone bagpiper plays out on the dock.

INT. TODD'S ROOM - NIGHT

Todd is pacing circles about his room as he reads his poem. His

pacing slows and then he tears the poem up.

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

Knox stands at the front of the room with his poem in hand.

				KNOX

				(quietly)

		"To Chris."

Charlie looks up from his desk with a grin.

				BOY 1

		Who's Chris? 

				BOY 2

		Mmm, Chris. 

				KNOX

		I see a sweetness in her smile. 

		Blight light shines from her eyes. 

		But life is complete; contentment is 

		mine, 

		Just knowing that...

Several students begin to snicker.

				KNOX

		just knowing that she's alive.

Knox crumples his poem and walks back to his desk.

				KNOX

		Sorry, Captain. It's stupid. 

				KEATING

		No, no. It's not stupid. It's a good 

		effort. It touched on one of the major 

		themes, love. A major theme not only in 

		poetry, but life. Mr. Hopkins, you were 

		laughing. You're up.

Hopkins slowly walks to the front of the class and unfolds

his piece of paper.

				HOPKINS

		"The cat sat on the mat." 

				KEATING

		Congratulations, Mr. Hopkins. Yours is 

		the first poem to ever have a negative 

		score on the Pritchard scale. We're not 

		laughing at you, we're laughing near 

		you. I don't mind that your poem had a 

		simple theme. Sometimes the most 

		beautiful poetry can be about simple 

		things, like a cat, or a flower or rain. 

		You see, poetry can come from anything 

		with the stuff of revelation in it. Just 

		don't let your poems be ordinary. Now, 

		who's next? 

Keating approaches Todd's desk.

				KEATING

		Mr. Anderson, I see you sitting there in 

		agony. Come on, Todd, step up. Let's put 

		you out of your misery. 

				TODD

		I, I didn't do it. I didn't write a 

		poem. 

				KEATING

		Mr. Anderson thinks that everything 

		inside of him is worthless and 

		embarrassing. Isn't that right, Todd? 

		Isn't that your worst fear? Well, I 

		think you're wrong. I think you have 

		something inside of you that is worth a 

		great deal.

Keating walks up to the blackboard and begins to write.

				KEATING

		"I sound my barbaric yawp over the 

		rooftops of the world." W. W. Uncle Walt 

		again. Now, for those of you who don't 

		know, a yawp is a loud cry or yell. Now, 

		Todd, I would like you to give us a 

		demonstration of a barbaric "yawp." Come 

		on. You can't yawp sitting down. Let's 

		go. Come on. Up.

Todd reluctantly stands and follows Keating to the front.

				KEATING

		You gotta get in "yawping" stance. 

				TODD

		A yawp?

				KEATING

		No, not just a yawp. A barbaric yawp. 

				TODD

				(quietly)

		Yawp. 

				KEATING

		Come on, louder. 

				TODD

				(quietly)

		Yawp. 

				KEATING

		No, that's a mouse. Come on. Louder. 

				TODD

		Yawp. 

				KEATING

		Oh, good God, boy. Yell like a man! 

				TODD

				(shouting)

		Yawp! 

				KEATING

		There it is. You see, you have a 

		barbarian in you, after all.

Todd goes to return to his seat but Keating stops him.

				KEATING

		Now, you don't get away that easy.

Keating turns Todd around and points out a picture on the wall.

				KEATING

		The picture of Uncle Walt up there. What 

		does he remind you of? Don't think. 

		Answer. Go on.

Keating begins to circle around Todd.

				TODD

		A m-m-madman. 

				KEATING

		What kind of madman? Don't think about 

		it. Just answer again. 

				TODD

		A c-crazy madman. 

				KEATING

		No, you can do better than that. Free up 

		your mind. Use your imagination. Say the 

		first thing that pops into your head, 

		even if it's total gibberish. Go on, go 

		on. 

				TODD

		Uh, uh, a sweaty-toothed madman. 

				KEATING

		Good God, boy, there's a poet in you, 

		after all. There, close your eyes. Close 

		your eyes. Close 'em. Now, describe what 

		you see. 

Keating puts his hands over Todd's eyes and they begin to slowly

spin around.

				TODD

		Uh, I-I close my eyes. 

				KEATING

		Yes? 

				TODD

		Uh, and this image floats beside me. 

				KEATING

		A sweaty-toothed madman? 

				TODD

		A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare 

		that pounds my brain. 

				KEATING

		Oh, that's excellent. Now, give him 

		action. Make him do something. 

				TODD

		H-His hands reach out and choke me. 

				KEATING

		That's it. Wonderful. Wonderful.

Keating removes his hands from Todd but Todd keeps his eyes

closed.

				TODD

		And, and all the time he's mumbling. 

				KEATING

		What's he mumbling? 

				TODD

		M-Mumbling, "Truth. Truth is like, like 

		a blanket that always leaves your feet 

		cold." 

The students begin to laugh and Todd opens his eyes. Keating

quickly gestures for him to close them again.

				KEATING

		Forget them, forget them. Stay with the 

		blanket. Tell me about that blanket. 

				TODD

		Y-Y-Y-You push it, stretch it, it'll 

		never be enough. You kick at it, beat 

		it, it'll never cover any of us. From 

		the moment we enter crying to the moment 

		we leave dying, it will just cover your 

		face as you wail and cry and scream. 

Todd opens his eyes. The class is silent. Then they begin to clap

and cheer.

				KEATING

			   (whispering to Todd)

		Don't you forget this.

EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY

Keating's students are playing a soccer game. After they score the

winning goal they hoist Keating onto their shoulders and carry him

away.

INT. CAVE - DAY

The boys are all sitting around the cave lighting their pipes.

				CHARLIE

		Attaboy, Pittsie, inhale deeply. 

				MEEKS

		My dad collects a lot of pipes. 

				CHARLIE

		Really? Mine's got thirty. 

				PITTS

		Your parents collect pipes? Oh, that's 

		really interesting. 

				CHARLIE

		Come on, Knox. Join in. 

				MEEKS

		Yeah, Knox, we're from the government. 

		We're here to help, man. 

				CHARLIE

		What's wrong? 

				PITTS

		It's Chris. Here's a picture of Chris 

		for you.

Pitts holds up a centerfold.

				MEEKS

		Smoke that. Put that in your pipe and 

		smoke it. 

				KNOX

		That's not funny. 

				CHARLIE

		Knock it off. Smoke your pipes. 

				MEEKS

		Neil!

Neil enters the cave carrying a beat up light stand.

				NEIL

		Friend, scholar, Welton men. 

				MEEKS

		What is that, Neil? 

				PITTS

		Duh. It's a lamp, Meeks.

Neil removes the shade from the lamp, revealing the shape of a man

as the base of the lamp.

				NEIL

		No. This is the god of the cave. 

				MEEKS

		The god of the cave.

Charlie begins making loud noises with his saxophone.

				PITTS

		Charlie, what are you doing? 

				CHARLIE

		What do you say we start this meeting? 

				BOY 1

		Y-Yeah, just-- I need a light. I just 

		gotta- 

				BOY 2

		Got my earplugs?

Charlie stands up and clears his throat.

				CHARLIE

		Gentlemen, "Poetrusic" by Charles 

		Dalton.

Charlie begins playing erratic notes on the sexophone.

				MEEKS

		Oh, no. 

				CHARLIE

		Laughing, crying, tumbling, mumbling. 

		Gotta do more. Gotta be more. 

Charlie plays more erratic sounds.

				CHARLIE

		Chaos screaming, chaos dreaming. Gotta 

		do more! Gotta be more!

Charlie starts to play a real tune on the saxophone.

				MEEKS

		Wow! 

				PITTS

		That was nice. That was great. Where did 

		you learn to play like that? 

				CHARLIE

		My parents made me take the clarinet for 

		years. 

				CAMERON

		I love the clarinet. 

				CHARLIE

		I hated it. The saxophone. The saxophone 

		is more sonorous. 

				CAMERON

		Ooh. 

				MEEKS

		Vocabulary. 

Knox jumps up.

				KNOX

		I can't take it anymore. If I don't have 

		Chris, I'm gonna kill myself. 

				CHARLIE

		Knoxious, you've gotta calm down. 

				KNOX

		No, Charlie. That's just my problem. 

		I've been calm all my life. I'll do 

		something about that. 

				NEIL

		Where are you going? 

				CHARLIE

		What are you gonna do? 

				KNOX

		I'm gonna call her.

Knox begins to chuckle as he leaves the cave. The others

quickly grab their coats to follow him. Charlie goes back to

playing noise on his saxophone again.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Knox is making a call from the payphone.

				CHRIS (O.S.)

		Hello?

Knox immediately hangs up and looks at the other boys who are

all gathered around him.

				KNOX

		She's gonna hate me. The Danburrys will 

		hate me. My parents will kill me. 

		All right, goddamn it. You're right. 

		"Carpe diem." Even if it kills me. 

Knox puts in another coin and calls again.

				CHRIS (O.S.)

		Hello? 

				KNOX

		Hello, Chris? 

				CHRIS (O.S.)

		Yes. 

				KNOX

		Hi. This is Knox Overstreet. 

				CHRIS (O.S.)

		Oh, yes. Knox. Glad you called. 

				KNOX

		She's glad I called. 

				CHRIS (O.S.)

		Listen, Chet's parents are going out of 

		town this weekend, so he's having a 

		party. Would you like to come? 

				KNOX

		Would I like to come to a party? 

				CHARLIE

		Yes. Say, yes. 

				CHRIS (O.S.)

		Friday? Um- 

				KNOX

		Well, sure. 

				CHRIS (O.S.)

		About seven? 

				KNOX

		Okay, great. I-I'll be there, Chris. 

				CHRIS (O.S.)

		Okay. 

				KNOX

		Friday night at the Danburrys'. O-Okay. 

		Thank you. 

				CHRIS (O.S.)

		Okay. Bye. 

				KNOX

		Thank you. I'll see you. Bye. 

				KNOX

		Yawp! Can you believe it? She was gonna 

		call me. She invited me to a party with 

		her. 

				CHARLIE

		At Chet Danburry's house. 

				KNOX

		Yeah. 

				CHARLIE

		Well? 

				KNOX

		So? 

				CHARLIE

		So, you don't really think she means 

		you're going with her? 

				KNOX

		Well, of course not, Charlie. But that's 

		not the point. That's not the point at 

		all. 

				CHARLIE

		What is the point? 

				KNOX

		The point, Charlie, is, uh-- 

				CHARLIE

		Yeah? 

				KNOX

		that she was thinking about me. I've 

		only met her once, and already she's 

		thinking about me. Damn it. It's gonna 

		happen, guys. I feel it. She is going to 

		be mine. Carpe. Carpe!

Knox flips his scarf dramatically around his neck as he walks away

and climbs the stairs.

EXT. COURTYARD - DAY

The students are standing in a line while Cameron, Pitts, and Knox

are walking in a circle. Keating watches as they go around.

				KEATING

		No grades at stake, gentlemen. Just take 

		a stroll.

After a few moments, the three boys begin to march to the same beat.

				KEATING

		There it is. 

The other boys start clapping to the rhythm of their steps.

				KEATING

		I don't know, but I've been told-- 

				BOYS

		I don't know, but I've been told-- 

				KEATING

		Doing poetry is old-- 

				BOYS

		Doing poetry is old-- 

Mr. Nolan looks out at them from his office as Keating joins the

boys and begins marching with them.

				KEATING

		Left, left, left-right-left. Left, left, 

		left-right-left. Left, halt! 

The boys come to a halt.

				KEATING

		Thank you, gentlemen. If you noticed, 

		everyone started off with their own 

		stride, their own pace.

Keating begins walking very slowly.

				KEATING

		Mr. Pitts, taking his time. He knew he'll

		get there one day. Mr. Cameron, you could

		see him thinking, "Is this right? It might

		be right. It might be right. I know that. 

		Maybe not. I don't know."

Keating begins walking with his groin pushed forward.

				KEATING

		Mr. Overstreet, driven by deeper force.

		Yes. We know that. All right. Now, I

		didn't bring them up here to ridicule

		them. I brought them up here to illustrate

		the point of conformity: the difficulty in 

		maintaining your own beliefs in the face 

		of others. Now, those of you -- I see 

		the look in your eyes like, "I would've 

		walked differently." Well, ask 

		yourselves why you were clapping. Now, 

		we all have a great need for acceptance. 

		But you must trust that your beliefs are 

		unique, your own, even though others may 

		think them odd or unpopular, even though 

		the herd may go, "That's baaaaad." Robert 

		Frost said, "Two roads diverged in a 

		wood and I, I took the one less traveled 

		by, and that has made all the 

		difference." Now, I want you to find 

		your own walk right now. Your own way of 

		striding, pacing. Any direction. 

		Anything you want. Whether it's proud, 

		whether it's silly, anything. Gentlemen, 

		the courtyard is yours.

The students begin walking about, some walking casually, others

making up silly walks. Keating notices that Charlie is still

leaning up against one of the pillars.

				KEATING

		You don't have to perform. Just make it 

		for yourself. Mr. Dalton? You be joining 

		us? 

				CHARLIE

		Exercising the right not to walk. 

				KEATING

		Thank you, Mr. Dalton. You just 

		illustrated the point. Swim against the 

		stream.

Nolan moves away from the window where he had been watching them.

EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT

Neil is walking by with the notes for the play when he notices Todd

sitting off by himself on one of the walkways.

				NEIL

		Todd? Hey. 

				TODD

		Hey. 

				NEIL

		What's going on?

				TODD

		Nothing. Today's my birthday. 

				NEIL

		Is today your birthday? Happy birthday. 

				TODD

		Thanks. 

				NEIL

		What's you get? 

				TODD

		My parents gave me this. 

Neil looks down at a deskset sitting next to Todd, still in

its wrappings.

				NEIL

		Isn't this the same desk set- 

				TODD

		Yeah, yeah. They gave me the same thing 

		as last year. 

				NEIL

		Oh. 

				TODD

		Oh. 

				NEIL

				 (laughing)

		Maybe they thought you needed another 

		one. 

				TODD

		Maybe they weren't thinking about 

		anything at all. Uh, the funny thing is 

		about this is I, I didn't even like it 

		the first time. 

				NEIL

		Todd, I think you're underestimating the 

		value of this desk set.

Neil picks up the desk set and begins examining it more closely.

				NEIL

		I mean, who would want a football or

		a baseball, or-

				TODD

		Or a car. 

				NEIL

		Or a car if they could have a desk set 

		as wonderful as this one? I mean, if, if 

		I were ever going to buy a, a desk set 

		twice, I would probably buy this one 

		both times. In fact, its, its shape is, 

		it's rather aerodynamic, isn't it? I can 

		feel it. This desk set wants to fly.

Neil tosses the desk set lightly in the air. Todd stands up

and Neil hands him the desk set.

				NEIL

		Todd? The world's first unmanned flying 

		desk set.

Todd flings the desk set over the side of the walkway and it

falls to pieces down below.

				TODD

		Oh, my! 

				NEIL

		Well, I wouldn't worry. You'll get 

		another one next year.

INT. CAVE - NIGHT

All the boys but Knox and Charlie are gathered in the cave.

				BOYS

		"To live deep and suck out all the 

		marrow of life. To put to rout all that 

		was not life"

The boys stop as they hear the sound of female laughter outside.

				CAMERON

		Oh, my God! 

				GLORIA

		Is this it? 

				CHARLIE

		Yeah, this is it. Go ahead, go on in. 

		It's my cave. Watch your step. 

				TINA

		We're not gonna slip, are we? 

				GLORIA

		Uh-oh.

Gloria hops into the cave wearing a bright red shirt. The lights from

the boys' flashlights play conspicously over Gloria's chest. Tina

enters right behind her.

				GLORIA

		Hi.

Meeks stands up and slams his head into the low ceiling.

				MEEKS

		Hello. 

				GLORIA

		Hello. 

				CHARLIE

		Hi, you guys. Meet, uh, Gloria and-- 

				TINA

		Tina. 

				CHARLIE

		Tina. This is the pledge class of the 

		Dead Poets Society.

				BOYS

		Hello. How do you do? 

				NEIL

		Hello. 

				GLORIA

		Hi. Hi. 

				CHARLIE

		Guys, move. Move. Come on, folks. It's 

		Friday night. Let's get on with the 

		meeting.

The boys move aside to let the girls in.

				BOYS

		Sorry. Excuse- Excuse me. 

				CHARLIE

		Guys, I have an announcement to make. In 

		keeping with the spirit of passionate 

		experimentation of the Dead Poets, I'm 

		giving up the name Charlie Dalton. From 

		now on, call me Nuwanda. 

				PITTS

				(laughing)

		Nuwanda? 

				NEIL

		Nuwanda? 

Tina takes out a tube of red lipstick. Charlie takes it from her

and puts red marks on each of his cheeks.

INT. CHET'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Knox enters the house and looks anxiously about.

				KNOX

		Hello? Hello, Chris?

Knox stops and combs his hair in the hallway mirror. Chris comes

running out from one of the rooms.

				CHRIS

		Knox! 

				KNOX

		Hi. 

				CHRIS

		You made it. Great! Bring anybody? 

				KNOX

		No. 

Chris grabs Knox by his jackets and pulls him forward as she walks

toward the stairs.

				CHRIS

		No. Ginny Danburry's here. Wait. I have 

		to go find Chet. Why don't you go 

		downstairs where everybody is?

Chris runs up the stairs as Knox stares after her.

				CHRIS

		Make yourself at home. 

				KNOX

		But I--

INT. CHET'S BASEMENT - NIGHT

Knox stares at a couple kissing passionately. Across the room he sees

Chet and Chris dancing. He walks away.

INT. CHET'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Knox enters the kitchen, walking between several football players

to fill up a mug of beer from a keg.

				STEVE

		Hey, you Mutt Sanders' brother? Bubba, 

		this guy look like Mutt Sanders to you 

		or what? 

Bubba spits ice cubes into the sink.

				BUBBA

		You're his brother? 

				KNOX

		No relation. Never heard of him. Sorry, 

		guys. 

				BUBBA

			  (obviously drunk)

		Where's your manners Steve? Mutt Sanders' 

		brother, we don't even offer him a 

		drink. Here. Go have some whiskey, pal. 

Bubba hands Knox a glass and fills it up.

				STEVE

		Yeah. 

				KNOX

		Whoa, I, uh, I don't really drink-- 

				BUBBA

		To Mutt. 

				STEVE

		To Mutt.

The two guys raise their glasses in a toast and Knox reluctantly

joins them.

				KNOX

		To Mutt.

They each take a big drink. Knox rolls his eyes and gasps,

loosening his tie to try and breathe.

				BUBBA

		Now, how the hell is old Mutt, anyway? 

				STEVE

		Yeah. What's ol' Mutter been up to, huh? 

				KNOX

		I don't really know Mutt. 

				BUBBA

		To Mighty Mutt. 

				GUY 1

		To Mighty Mutt. 

				KNOX

		To Mighty Mutt.

They raise their glasses again for a toast and down the rest

of their glasses.

				BUBBA

		Well, listen, I gotta go find Patsy. Say 

		hello to Mutt for me, okay? 

				KNOX

		Will do.

Bubba puts on a horned football helmet and walks away.

				STEVE

		Yeah. Hell of a guy, your brother Mutt.

INT. CAVE - NIGHT

				CHARLIE

		We gonna have a meeting or what? 

				GLORIA

		Yeah. If you guys don't have a meeting, 

		how do we know if we wanna join? 

				NEIL

		Join? 

Charlie leans over to Tina.

				CHARLIE

		"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? 

		Thou art more lovely and more 

		temperate." 

				TINA

		That's so sweet. 

				CHARLIE

		I made that up just for you. 

				TINA

		You did?

The boys laugh and Cameron shakes his head. Charlie moves over

to sit next to Gloria.

				CHARLIE

		I'll write one for you too, Gloria. 

		She walks in beauty like the night. 

		She walks in beauty like the night. 

		Of cloudless climes and starry skies. 

		All that's best, dark and bright, 

		Meet in her aspect and her eyes. 

				GLORIA

		That's beautiful. 

				CHARLIE

		There's plenty more where that came 

		from.

INT. CHET'S BASEMENT - NIGHT

The room is whirling as Knox belches and staggers across the room. He

passes Chet and several of his friends. He steps over several couples

kissing on the floor and slump down on the couch, only to be crowded

in by another couple who seem oblivious to him. He is about to get up

again when he notices Chris sleeping next to him on the couch.

				KNOX

		God help me.

Knox looks about and then looks back down at Chris.

				KNOX

		Carpe diem.

Knox takes a last swig of his drink  and then begins to softly run his

fingers over Chris' hair. He then leans over and kisses her forehead.

Across the room, Bubba looks over and sees what's going on.

				BUBBA

		Chet! Chet! Look! 

				CHET

		What? 

				BUBBA

		It's Mutt Sanders' brother. 

				CHET

		Huh? 

Chris rises up from the couch and looks at Knox in surprise.

				CHRIS

		Knox, what-- 

				BUBBA

		And he's feeling up your girl! 

				CHRIS

		What are you doing? 

Chet gets up from his chair.

				CHET

		What the hell are you doing? 

				CHRIS

		Chet! Chet, don't. 

				KNOX

		Now, Chet, I know this looks bad, but 

		you've gotta-

Chet throws himself at Knox, hurling them both to the floor. He

then straddles Knox and begins to punch at him as Knox simply

tries to protect himself.

				CHRIS

		Chet, no! You'll hurt him! No! No! Stop 

		it! Leave him alone! 

				CHET

		Goddamn! 

				CHRIS

		Chet, stop it!

Chris manages to haul Chet away from Knox.

				CHET

		Bastard!

Knox takes his hands away from his face and feels at his bloody

nose. Chris tries to help him up.

				CHRIS

		Knox, are you all right? 

				CHET

		Chris, get the hell away from him! 

				CHRIS

		Chet, you hurt him! 

				CHET

		Good! 

				KNOX

		I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 

				CHRIS

		It's okay. It-It's okay.

Chet hauls Chris away from Knox and then points at him.

				CHET

		Next time I see you, you die. 

INT. CAVE - NIGHT

Tina passes a bottle of alcohol to Neil.

				TINA

		Go ahead, pass it around. 

Cameron motions for Neil not to take it but Neil takes a swig anyway.

There is a moment of awkward silence.

				MEEKS

		Me and Pitts are working on a hi-fi 

		system. It shouldn't be that hard to, 

		uh, to put together. 

				PITTS

		Yeah. Uh, I might be going to Yale. Uh, 

		uh, but, I, I might not. 

				GLORIA

		Don't you guys miss having girls around 

		here? 

				MEEKS AND PITTS

				  (smiling)

		Yeah.

				CHARLIE

		That's part of what this club is about. 

		In fact, I'd like to announce I 

		published an article in the school 

		paper, in the name of the Dead Poets. 

				CAMERON

		What? 

				CHARLIE

		Demanding girls be admitted to Welton. 

				PITTS

		You didn't. 

				CHARLIE

			    (whispering to Meeks)

		So we can all stop beating off. 

				NEIL

		How did you do that? 

				CHARLIE

		I'm one of the proofers. I slipped the 

		article in. 

				MEEKS

		Look, uh, it's, it's over now. 

				CHARLIE

		Why? Nobody knows who we are. 

				CAMERON

		Well, don't you think they're gonna 

		figure out who wrote it? They're gonna 

		come to you and ask to know what the 

		Dead Poets Society is. Charlie, you had 

		no right to do something like that. 

				CHARLIE

		It's Nuwanda, Cameron. 

				GLORIA

		That's right. It's Nuwanda. 

				CHARLIE

		Are we just playing around out here, or 

		do we mean what we say? For all we do is 

		come together and reach a bunch of poems 

		to each other. What the hell are we 

		doing? 

				NEIL

		All right, but you still shouldn't have 

		done it, Charlie. This could mean 

		trouble. You don't speak for the club. 

				CHARLIE

		Hey, would you not worry about your 

		precious little neck? If they catch me, 

		I'll tell them I made it up. 

INT. ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY

The professors hurry down the steps, lead by an obviously agitated

Mr. Nolan. Several are carrying newspapers in their hands. The

students all rise as they enter. After all the professors have

taken their places, Mr. Nolan addresses the students.

				MR. NOLAN

		Sit.

The students all sit.

				MR. NOLAN

		In this week of Welton's Honor there 

		appeared a profane and unauthorized 

		article. Rather than spend my valuable 

		time ferreting out the guilty persons -- 

		and let me assure you I will find them -

		- I'm asking any and all students who 

		knows anything about this article to 

		make themselves known here and now. 

		Whoever the guilty persons are, this is 

		your only chance to avoid expulsion from 

		this school.

The sound of a phone ringing can be heard. The professors look

about for its source. Charlie picks up a telephone receiver.

				CHARLIE

		Welton Academy. Hello. Yes, he is. Just 

		a moment.

Charlie stands up, holding a phone and bell in his hands.

				CHARLIE

		Mr. Nolan, it's for you. It's 

		God. He says we should have girls at 

		Welton.

Most of the students laugh while the boys from the cave all shake

their heads in disbelief.

INT. NOLAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Charlie stands with his back to the door as Mr. Nolan shuts it. Mr. 

Nolan then walks around to face Charlie.

				MR. NOLAN

		Wipe that smirk off your face. If you 

		think, Mr. Dalton, that you're the first 

		to try to get thrown out of this school, 

		think again. Others have had similar 

		notions and have failed just as surely 

		as you will fail. Assume the position.

Charlie sighs and bends over, resting his hands on the desk. Mr.

Nolan hefts a flat wooden paddle in his hands.

				MR. NOLAN

		Count aloud, Mr. Dalton.

Mr. Nolan begins to strike Charlie with the paddle.

				CHARLIE

		One. Two. Three. Four. Five. 

				MR. NOLAN

		What is this Dead Poets Society? I want 

		names.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

A crowd of students is gathered about as Charlie stiffly walks back to his room.

				NEIL

		You kicked out? 

				CHARLIE

		No. 

				NEIL

		So what happened? 

				CHARLIE

		I'm to turn everybody in, apologize to 

		the school and all will be forgiven. 

				NEIL

		So, what are you gonna do? Charlie! 

				CHARLIE

		Damn it, Neil. The name is Nuwanda.

Charlie smiles and then shuts his door.

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

Keating and McAllister are enjoying tea in the small room off the

classroom. Mr. Nolan knocks on the door and enters.

				MR. NOLAN

		Excuse me. May we have a word, Mr. 

		Keating? 

				KEATING

		Certainly.

Keating fixes his tie and follows Mr. Nolan into the classroom.

				MR. NOLAN

		This was my first classroom, John. Did 

		you know that? My first desk. 

				KEATING

		Didn't know you taught, Mr. Nolan. 

				MR. NOLAN

		English. Oh, long before your time. It 

		was hard giving it up, I can tell you. 

		I'm hearing rumors, John, about some 

		unorthodox teaching methods in your 

		classroom. I'm not saying they've 

		anything to do with the Dalton boy's 

		outburst. But I don't think I have to 

		warn you boys his age are very 

		impressionable. 

				KEATING

		Well, your reprimand made quite an 

		impression, I'm sure. 

				MR. NOLAN

		What was going on in the courtyard the 

		other day? 

				KEATING

		Courtyard? 

				MR. NOLAN

		Yeah. Boys marching, clapping in unison. 

				KEATING

		Oh, that. That was an exercise to prove 

		a point. Dangers of conformity. 

				MR. NOLAN

		Well, John, the curriculum here is set. 

		It's proven it works. If you question, 

		what's to prevent them from doing the 

		same? 

				KEATING

		I always thought the idea of educating 

		was to learn to think for yourself. 

				MR. NOLAN

		At these boys' ages? Not on your life! 

		Tradition, John. Discipline. Prepare 

		them for college, and the rest will take 

		care of itself.

INT. STUDY ROOM - DAY

Charlie sits with his bongos as the other boys are all crowded

around him. He hits the bongoes as he mimes Nolan's footsteps.

				CHARLIE

		Creak. He started walking around towards 

		my left. Creak. Creak. "Assume the 

		position, Mr. Dalton."

The door opens and Keating walks in. Many of the boys get up from

their seats.

				KEATING

		It's all right, gentlemen. 

				CHARLIE

		Mr. Keating. 

				KEATING

		Mr. Dalton. That was a pretty lame stunt 

		you pulled today. 

				CHARLIE

		You're siding with Mr. Nolan? What about 

		Carpe diem and sucking all the marrow 

		out of life and all that? 

				KEATING

		Sucking the marrow out of life doesn't 

		mean choking on the bone. Sure there's a 

		time for daring and there's a time for 

		caution, and a wise man understands 

		which is called for. 

				CHARLIE

		But I thought you'd like that. 

				KEATING

		No. You being expelled from school is 

		not daring to me. It's stupid, 'cause 

		you'll miss some golden opportunities. 

				CHARLIE

		Yeah. Like what? 

				KEATING

		Like, if nothing else, the opportunity 

		to attend my classes. Got it, Ace? 

				CHARLIE

		Aye, aye, Captain. 

				KEATING

		Keep your head about you. That goes for 

		the lot of you. 

				BOYS

		Yes, Captain. 

				KEATING

		Phone call from God. If it had been 

		collect, it wouldn't been daring.

Keating leaves and the boys gather around Charlie once again.

				CHARLIE

		All right. Go on.

EXT. CAMPUS - DAY

Neil bikes away as the clock bell tolls.

INT. THEATER - DAY

Neil walks into the back of the theater and watches various

actors rehearsing on stage. A smile fills his face.

				DIRECTOR

		We're trying to rehearse, okay? Start. 

				LYSANDER

		A good persuasion, therefore hear me, 

		Hermia. 

				DIRECTOR

		Wait, please. Excitement. I don't hear 

		any excitement about this play. And take 

		her hand. Bring her down the stage and 

		stop. And "There, gentle Hermia." Okay? 

		Try again.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

The bell rings and students rush down the hall.

				BOY

		What's for dinner? 

				PITTS

		Spaghetti and meatballs!

Neil comes up the stairs as everyone else swarms down to the cafeteria.

				NEIL

		Save some for me. "But, room, Fairy! 

		Here comes Oberon."

Neil opens the door to his room and sees his father sitting at his desk.

				NEIL

		Father. 

				MR. PERRY

		Neil. 

				NEIL

		Wait a minute. Before you say anything, 

		please let me ex-

Mr. Perry rises from the desk.

				MR. PERRY

		Don't you dare talk back to me! It's bad 

		enough that you've wasted your time with 

		this, this absurd acting business. But 

		you deliberately deceived me! How, how, 

		how did you expect to get away with 

		this? Answer me. Who put you up to it? 

		Was it this new man? This, uh, Mr. 

		Keating? 

				NEIL

		No. Nobody-- I thought I'd surprise you. 

		I've gotten all A's in every class. 

				MR. PERRY

		Did you think I wasn't going to find 

		out? "Oh, my niece is in a play with 

		your son," says Mrs. Marks. "No, no, 

		no," I say, "you must be mistaken. My 

		son's not in a play." You made me a liar 

		of me, Neil! Now, tomorrow you go to 

		them and you tell them that you're 

		quitting. 

				NEIL

		No, I can't. I have the main part. The 

		performance is tomorrow night. 

				MR. PERRY

		I don't care if the world comes to an 

		end tomorrow night. You are through with 

		that play. Is that clear? Is that clear? 

				NEIL

		Yes, sir. 

Mr. Perry goes to leave and then turns around.

				MR. PERRY

		I made a great many sacrifices to get 

		you here, Neil, and you will not let me 

		down. 

				NEIL

		No, sir. 

INT. KEATING'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Keating is seated at his desk. He is writing a letter and occasionally

looks up at the framed photo on his desk of a woman playing the cello.

There is a knock at the door.

				KEATING

		It's open.

Neil enters and closes the door behind him. He appears to be nervous.

				KEATING

		Neil, what's up? 

				NEIL

		Can I speak to you a minute? 

				KEATING

		Certainly. Sit down.

Neil goes to take a seat but notices the chair is piled up with books.

Neil picks them up and Keating gets up from his seat to help him.

				NEIL

		I'm sorry. Here. 

				KEATING

		Excuse me. Get you some tea? 

				NEIL

		Tea. Sure.

Keating goes to a table in the corner and begins pouring several cups.

				KEATING

		Like some milk or sugar in that? 

				NEIL

		No, thanks. 

				NEIL

		Gosh, they don't give you much room 

		around here. 

				KEATING

		No, it's part of the monastic oath. They 

		don't want worldly things distracting me 

		from my teaching.

Keating gives Neil a cup of tea and they return to their seats. Neil

looks at the photo on the desk.

				NEIL

		She's pretty. 

				KEATING

		She's also in London. Makes it a little 

		difficult. 

				NEIL

		How can you stand it? 

				KEATING

		Stand what? 

				NEIL

		You can go anywhere. You can do 

		anything. How can you stand being here? 

				KEATING

		'Cause I love teaching. I don't wanna be 

		anywhere else. 

				KEATING

		What's up? 

				NEIL

		I just talked to my father. He's making 

		me quit the play at Henley Hall. 

		Acting's everything to me. I-- But he 

		doesn't know. He-- I can see his point. 

		We're not a rich family like Charlie's, 

		and we-- But he's planning the rest of 

		my life for me, and I-- H-He's never 

		asked me what I want. 

				KEATING

		Have you ever told your father what you 

		just told me? About your passion for 

		acting. You ever show him that? 

				NEIL

		I can't. 

				KEATING

		Why not? 

				NEIL

		I can't talk to him this way. 

				KEATING

		Then you're acting for him, too. You're 

		playing the part of the dutiful son. I 

		know this sounds impossible, but you 

		have to talk to him. You have to show 

		him who you are, what your heart is. 

				NEIL

		I know what he'll say. He'll tell me 

		that acting's a whim, and I should 

		forget it. That how they're counting on 

		me. He'll just tell me to put it out of 

		my mind, "for my own good." 

				KEATING

		You are not an indentured servant. If 

		it's not a whim for you, you prove it to 

		him by your conviction and your passion. 

		You show him that And if he still 

		doesn't believe you, well, by then 

		you'll be out of school and you can do 

		anything you want. 

A tear falls down Neil's cheek and he wipes it away.

				NEIL

		No. What about the play? The show's 

		tomorrow night. 

				KEATING

		Well, you have to talk to him before 

		tomorrow night. 

				NEIL

		Isn't there an easier way? 

				KEATING

		No. 

				NEIL

		I'm trapped. 

				KEATING

		No, you're not.

EXT. CAMPUS - DAY

Knox exits one of the doors. The ground is covered with a thick

layer of snow. He looks around to see if anyone is about and then

hurries over to the bike rack. grabbing one of the bikes, he hurries

off.

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

A crowd of students come in from the cold. Knox pushes his way through

them, carrying a handful of wildflowers. He begins searching for Chris.

				KNOX

		Chris!

He approaches a girl with hair similar to Chris' and turns her around,

only to realize that it's not her.

				KNOX

		Chris Noel. Do you know where she is? 

				GIRL

		Um, I think she's in room 111.

The girl points down the hallway and Knox sets off in that direction.

				KNOX

		Thanks.

Chris is at her locker talking to a friend. She just closes her locker

as she notices Knox coming towards her. She turns away.

				KNOX

		Excuse me. Chris. 

				CHRIS

		Knox, what are you doing here? 

				KNOX

		I came to apologize for the other night. 

		I brought you these and a poem I wrote 

		for you.

Chris pulls him aside, out of the main hallway.

				CHRIS

		Knox, don't you know that, if Chet finds 

		you here he'll kill you? 

				KNOX

		I can't care. I love you, Chris. 

				CHRIS

		Knox, you're crazy. 

				KNOX

		Look, I acted like a jerk and I know it. 

		Please, accept these. Please. 

				CHRIS

		No. No-- I, I can't. Forget it.

Chris walks away. The school bell rings and she enters her

classroom, closing the door behind her. Undaunted, Knox follows,

opening the door and standing before her desk.

				CHRIS

		Knox, I don't believe this. 

				KNOX

		All I'm asking you to do is listen.

As Knox begins to read his poem, the classroom grows quiet as

everyone stops to listen.

				KNOX

		The heavens made a girl named Chris 

		With hair and skin of gold. 

		To touch her would be paradise.

Chris holds her head in her hands in embarrassment.

INT. CAMPUS KITCHEN - DAY

Knox sneaks in through a side door. He snatches a slice of toast

from the counter and motions to one of the staff to keep secret.

He then begins to eat the toast as he hurries away.

INT. STAIRWAY - DAY

The school bell rings and Knox pushes his way up the stairs past

the slower students. At the top he joins the other boys where they

are grabbing their books.

				CHARLIE

		Get out of here. Cameron, you fool.

Charlie notices Knox and grabs his jacket.

				CHARLIE

		Hey, how'd it go? Did you read it to

		her? 

				KNOX

		Yeah.

The boys begin to get all excited but Charlie shushes them.

				PITTS

		What'd she say? 

				KNOX

		Nothing. 

				CHARLIE

		Nothing. What do you mean, nothing? 

				KNOX

		Nothing. But I did it.

Knox walks away down the hall and the others chase after him.

				CHARLIE

		What did she say? I know she had to say 

		something. 

				PITTS

		Come here, Knox. 

				KNOX

		Seize the day!

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

Keating walks from the front of the classroom to Neil's desk. Neil

is the only student remaining in the class.

				KEATING

		Did you talk to your father? 

				NEIL

		Uh, he didn't like it one bit, but at 

		least he's letting me stay in the play. 

		He won't be able to make, make it. He's 

		in Chicago. But, uh, I think he's gonna 

		let me stay with acting. 

				KEATING

		Really? You told him what you told me? 

				NEIL

		Yeah. He wasn't happy. But he'll be gone 

		at least four days. I don't think he'll 

		make the show, but I think he'll let me 

		stay with it. "Keep up the school work." 

		Thanks.

Neil picks up his books and leaves.

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

The boys are grooming themselves in front of the mirrors.

				PITTS

		Beautiful baby. 

				MEEKS

		Beautiful baby. Henley Hall, here I 

		come. 

				CAMERON

		Excuse me, just a moment. Yes. You're so 

		cute.

Cameron runs a comb through his hair and Todd tries to mess it up.

				CAMERON

		Come on, Todd. I'm trying to fix 

		this. 

				TODD

		Come on, Nuwanda. You're gonna miss 

		Neil's entrance. 

				PITTS

		He said something about getting red 

		before we left. 

				CAMERON

		Getting red? What does that mean? 

				PITTS

		I, uh-- Well, you know Charlie.

One of the stalls opens and Charlie's hand emerges, holding a small

brush and a bottle of red paint.

				CAMERON

		So, Charlie, what's this "getting red" 

		bit?

Charlie opens his unbuttoned shirt to show a large red lightning bolt

painted down his chest.

				TODD

		W-What is that? 

				CHARLIE

		It's an Indian warrior symbol for 

		virility. Makes me feel potent, like it 

		can drive girls crazy.

Charlie buttons up his shirt as everyone prepares to leave.

				TODD

		Oh, come on, Charlie. The girls are 

		waiting.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

The boys are walking down the hall to leave. Cameron stops and stares.

The other boys notice and stop as well. Charlie softly whistles at Chris

standing by the door. Knox stares at her in surprise

				KNOX

		Chris.

Knox leaves the other boys to join her.

				KNOX

		What are you doing here? 

				KEATING (O.S.)

		Gentlemen, let's go. 

				KNOX

		Go ahead, guys. I'll catch up. 

				CHARLIE

		Yeah, come on, guys.

Charlie hustles the boys away. Meeks remains staring at her. Charlie

returns to drag him away.

				KNOX

		Chris, you can't be in here. I-If they 

		catch you, we're both gonna be in big 

		trouble. 

				CHRIS

		Oh, but it's fine--

Knox shushes her and leads her out the door.

EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT

Snow is lightly falling as Chris and Knox walk outside.

				CHRIS

		It's fine for you to come barging into 

		my school and make a complete fool out 

		of me? 

				KNOX

		I didn't mean to make a fool out of you. 

				CHRIS

		Well, you did. Chet found out. And it 

		took everything I could do to keep him 

		from coming here and killing you. Knox, 

		you have got to stop this stuff. 

				KNOX

		I can't, Chris. I love you. 

				CHRIS

		Knox, you say that over and over. You 

		don't, you don't even know me. 

Keating calls out from a nearby car.

				KEATING

		Will you be joining us, Mr. Overstreet?

				KNOX

		Go ahead, Captain. I'll walk. 

				CHRIS

		Knox, Knox, it just so happens that I 

		could care less about you? 

				KNOX

		Then you wouldn't be here warning me 

		about Chet. 

				CHRIS

		I have to go. I'm gonna be late for the 

		play. 

				KNOX

		Are you going with him? 

				CHRIS

				   (laughs)

		Chet? To a play? Are you kidding? 

				KNOX

		Then come with me. 

				CHRIS

		Knox, you are so infuriating. 

				KNOX

		Come on, Chris. Just give me one chance. 

		If you don't like me after tonight, I'll 

		stay away forever. 

				CHRIS

		Uh-huh. 

				KNOX

		I promise. Dead Poets Honor. You come 

		with me tonight. And then, if you don't 

		want to see me again, I swear I'll bow 

		out. 

				CHRIS

		You know what would happen if Chet found 

		out? 

				KNOX

		He won't know anything. We'll sit in the 

		back and sneak away as soon as it's 

		over. 

				CHRIS

		And I suppose you would promise that 

		this would be the end of it. 

				KNOX

		Dead Poets Honor. 

				CHRIS

		What is that? 

				KNOX

		My word.

Chris walks away from him and then turns to face him.

				CHRIS

		You are so infuriating.

Chris gestures for Knox to follow her. Charlie does a little 

twirl as he joins her and puts his arm around her. They walk away.

INT. THEATER - NIGHT

The audience is packed. The stage is set up to resemble a forest and

lights dance about it. From behind a bush, Neil emerges, wearing a

crown of twigs and berries and twigs on his hands. In the audience,

Charlie emerges from his seat, all excited.

				CHARLIE

		Hey, there he is! Hey, hey.

Cameron shoves him back into his seat.

				KEATING

		Shh, boys.

On stage, Neil hides behind a tree as a girl emerges, similarly clad,

but with flowers in her hair. Neil sneaks over to the girl.

				FAIRY

		Either I mistake your shape and making 

		quite, 

		Or else you are that shrewd and knavish 

		sprite 

		Call'd Robin Goodfellow: 

				PUCK

		Thou speak'st aright;

In the audience, Chris and Knox enter and are shown to seats.

				PUCK

		I am that merry wanderer of the night. 

		I jest to Oberon and make him smile 

		When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,

Puck makes horse sounds and the audience laughs.

				PUCK

		Neighing in likeness of a filly foal: 

		And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl, 

		In very likeness of a roasted crab, 

		And when she drinks, against her lips I 

		bob 

		And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale. 

		The wisest aunt, telling the saddest 

		tale,

In the audience, Charlie leans over towards Keating.

				CHARLIE

				  (whispering)

		He's good. He's really good.

Keating gives a thumbs up.

				PUCK

		Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh 

		me; 

		Then slip I from her bum, down topples 

		she, 

		And "tailor" cries, and falls into a 

		cough; 

		And then the whole quire hold their hips 

		and laugh, 

		And waxen in their mirth and neeze and 

		swear 

		A merrier hour was never wasted there. 

		But, room, Fairy! here comes Oberon. 

				FAIRY

		And here my mistress. Would that he were 

		gone!

The two actors hide behind the trees, lifting their twig covered

hands to hide themselves.

INT. THEATER - NIGHT

Two other actors are onstage. 

				LYSANDER

		Then by your side no bed-room me deny; 

		For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie 

				HERMIA

		Lysander riddles very prettily: 

		Now much beshrew my manners and my 

		pride, 

		If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied. 

		But, gentle friend, for love and 

		courtesy 

		Lie further off; in human modesty, 

		Such separation as may well be said 

		Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid, 

		and, good night, sweet friend: 

		Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life 

		end!

Neil is watching the actors from the wing. He glances out at the audience

and sees his father enter the back of the theater. Neil backs away into

the shadows.

				LYSANDER

		Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I;

The director breaks Neil out of his thoughts.

				DIRECTOR

		Neil. That's your cue, Neil. Come on, 

		Neil. Here's your crown. Let's go.

Neil reluctantly replaces his crown and follows her.

INT. THEATER - NIGHT

On stage, Neil collects dew in a leaf and holds it over his head while

fairies dance about. In the audience, Knox takes Chris' hand in his.

INT. THEATER - NIGHT

The stage is dark. A spotlight comes on to reveal Neil with his back to

the audience. He slowly turns around to face the audience and his father.

				PUCK

		If we shadows have offended,

Neil directs his eyes at his father, who stills stands at the back

of the theater.

				PUCK

		Think but this, and all is mended, 

		That you have but slumber'd here 

		While these visions did appear. 

		And this weak and idle theme, 

		No more yielding but a dream, 

		Gentles, do not reprehend: 

		If you pardon, we will mend: 

		And, as I am an honest Puck, 

		If we have unearned luck 

		Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue, 

		We will make amends ere long; 

		Else the Puck a liar call; 

		So, good night unto you all. 

		Give me your hands, if we be friends, 

		And Robin shall restore amends.

Neil backs away and the curtains close as the audience begins to

applaud enthusiastically. Behind the curtain numerous people

congratulate Neil as they line up for the curtain call. The curtains

open. Charlie and the other boys rise to their feet, followed quickly

by the rest of the audience. The actors bow to continued applause. The

actors push Neil forward and he takes a second bow.

				BOYS

		Yawp! 

				KNOX

		Yeah, Neil!

The curtain closes again and Neil turns around, letting out an

excited sigh. Various actors continue to congratulate him. Neil

lets out a yell as he walks offstage. In the audience, while others

are leaving, Mr. Perry approaches a woman.

				MR. PERRY

		Excuse me, I'm Neil's father. I need to 

		see him.

Backstage, the woman approaches Neil.

				WOMAN

		Neil, Your father. He's-

Neil nods in agreement.

				ACTOR

		What did you think?

				WOMAN

		Really I thought you were all just 

		wonderful!

Neil emerges from the curtains, carrying his costume. The theater is

nearly empty now, except for Mr. Perry standing at the back. Neil

smiles at him but the smile quickly disappears.

EXT. THEATER - NIGHT

Mr. Perry pushes his way through the crowd of people, with Neil close

behind.

				MR. PERRY

		Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

The boys notice Neil and try to dtop him to talk.

				CHARLIE

		Neil, Neil, you were great. 

				NEIL

		I can't, guys. 

				TODD

		Neil! Neil!

Outside of the crowd, Keating manages to catch up to Neil. He takes

hold of Neil's coat.

				KEATING

		Neil. Neil. You have the gift. What a 

		performance You left even me speechless. 

		You have to stay with-

Mr. Perry returns from his car and shoves Neil aside.

				MR. PERRY

		Get in the car. Keating, you stay away 

		from my son. 

				CHARLIE

		Neil! Neil! Mr. Perry, come on. 

				KEATING

		Don't make it any worse than it is.

Neil and Mr. Perry get into their car and drive away. Keating

stares after them.

				CHARLIE

		Is it okay if we walk back? Captain?

Charlie motions Todd to follow.

				CHARLIE

		Knox.

The boys leave and Keating continues to stare after the car, wiping

the falling snow from his face.

INT. MR. PERRY'S STUDY - NIGHT

A photo of Neil standing stiffly with his parents sits on a table

between a glass of alcohol and a half filled ashtray. Mrs. Perry

watches through the window as her husband and son arrive and then

takes a nervous puff on her cigarette before sitting down. Mr.

Perry walks in with Neil close behind him. Neil sits down beside the

desk while Mr. Perry remains standing.

				MR. PERRY

		We're trying very hard to understand why 

		it is that you insist on defying us. 

		Whatever the reason, we're not gonna let 

		you ruin your life. Tomorrow I'm 

		withdrawing you from Welton and 

		enrolling you in Braden Military School. 

		You're going to Harvard and you're gonna 

		be a doctor. 

				NEIL

		But that's ten more years. Father, 

		that's a lifetime! 

				MR. PERRY

		Oh, stop it. Don't be so dramatic. You 

		make it sound like a prison term. You 

		don't understand, Neil. You have 

		opportunities that I never even dreamt 

		of and I am not going to let you waste 

		them.

Neil rises to his feet.

				NEIL

		I've got to tell you what I feel.

Mrs. Perry stands up.

				MRS. PERRY

		We've been so worried about-- 

				MR. PERRY

		What? What? Tell me what you feel. What 

		is it?

Neil looks to his mother and then back to his father but says

nothing.

				MR. PERRY

		Is it more of this, this acting 

		business? Because you can forget that. 

		What? 

				NEIL

		Nothing.

Neil sits back down dejectedly.

				MR. PERRY

		Nothing? Well, then, let's go to bed.

Mr. Perry leaves. Mrs. Perry pauses on her way out and kneels

behind Neil.

				NEIL

		I was good. I was really good.

Mrs. Perry nods slightly.

				MRS. PERRY

		Go on, get some sleep.

INT. MR. PERRY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Mrs. Perry sits on the side of the bed with her back to her

husband. Mr. Perry removes his robe and slippers before

getting in to bed. Mrs. Perry begins to cry as he turns out

the light.

				MR. PERRY

		It's all right. It's going to be all 

		right.

INT. NEIL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Neil's pyjamas, bathrobe, towel, and shaving kit are all neatly

laid out on his bed. Neil touches his pyjamas lightly and then

removes his coat and shirt. He walks over to the windows and

opens them, taking several deep breaths. He places the crown of

twigs on his head and then closes his eyes, slowly letting his head

fall to his chest.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

A door opens and Neil emerges, slowly walking down the stairs as if

in a trance.

INT. MR. PERRY'S STUDY - NIGHT

Neil holds a key in his hands. He unlocks a drawer in his father's

desk and pulls out a pistol, wrapped in cloth.

INT. MR. PERRY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Mr. Perry jerks up out of bed, startled and breathing fast.

				MR. PERRY

		What was that? 

				MRS. PERRY

		What? 

				MR. PERRY

		That sound. 

				MRS. PERRY

		What sound? Tom?

Mr. Perry turns on the light and gets up out of bed, putting on his

robe and slippers.

				MRS. PERRY

		What is it? What's wrong? 

Mr. Perry turns on the hallway light and knocks on Neil's door. He opens

the door and goes inside.

				MR. PERRY

		Neil.

Mr. Perry notices the open window.

				MRS. PERRY

		Tom, what is it? What's wrong? Neil?

Mr. Perry continues to look through the house, continuing downstairs.

				MR. PERRY

		Neil?

Mr. Perry notices the door to his study is ajar.

				MRS. PERRY

		I'll look outside. Neil?

Mr. Perry flicks the light on but sees nothing. Then he smells

something. Looking closer, he sees a thin cloud of smoke rising from

behind his desk. As he moves around the desk he sees his gun on the

floor and Neil's outstretched hand.

				MR. PERRY

		No!

Mr. Perry crouches down by his son.

				MR. PERRY

		Oh, Neil! Oh, my God!

Mrs. Perry enters the room and sees her son.

				MRS. PERRY

		Oh! No! 

				MR. PERRY

		Oh, my son! 

				MRS. PERRY

		He's all right. 

				MR. PERRY

		My son! My poor son! 

				MRS. PERRY

			    (crying hysterically)

		He's all right! He's all right! He's all 

		right! He's all right! He's all right! 

		He's all right! 

				MR. PERRY

		Stop it! Stop it! Stop it.

Mr. Perry holds his wife and tries to comfort her.

INT. TODD'S ROOM - NIGHT

Todd is sleeping. Charlie reaches across to wake him. Tears are

running down his face.

				CHARLIE

		Todd? Todd.

Todd, still half asleep, tries to shrug him off.

				TODD

		Oh, Charlie.

Todd opens his eyes and sees Charlie's face

				TODD

		What is it?

Todd looks over to see Pitts, Meeks, and Knox by the door.

				CHARLIE

		Neil's dead.

EXT. CAMPUS - DAY

It is a snowy, overcast morning. Todd walks through the snow. He

has his coat on over his pyjamas. The other boys follow closely

behind him as he walks down towards the water. He stops and stares

out at the snow-covered surroundings.

				TODD

		It's so beautiful.

Todd begins to gag and then goes down on his knees, vomiting into

the snow. The other boys huddle around him, hugging him.

				CHARLIE

		Todd. It's okay, Todd. 

				PITTS

		Calm down. 

				CHARLIE

		It's all right, Todd. 

				PITTS

		Todd, it's okay. It's okay, Todd. 

				CHARLIE

		It's all right. It's alright.

Charlie grabs a handful of snow and wipes Todd's mouth with it. 

				TODD

		He wouldn't-- He wouldn't have done it. 

				MEEKS

		You can't explain it, Todd. 

				TODD

		It was his father! 

				CHARLIE

		No! 

				TODD

		He wouldn't have left us. It's because he-

		He wouldn't have. His dad was-- his, his 

		father did it. 

				CHARLIE

		Todd. 

				TODD

		His father killed him. He made him do it.

				MEEKS

		You can't explain it, Todd.

Todd pushes himself away from the boys and stumbles down the hill,

slipping and falling in the snow.

				MEEKS

		Todd! 

				CHARLIE

		Leave him be.

The boys watch as Todd runs down towards the dock by the river,

yelling and crying. He finally seems to regain control of himself

and walks in silence out onto the dock.

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

Keating sits by himself at his desk. After a moment he gets up

and walks over to Neil's desk. Opening it, he finds his copy

of "Five Centuries of Verse" and flips through the first few pages.

Sitting down at the desk, he returns to the opening page, reading

the opening verse written there. Keating begins to sob, then closes

the book.

INT. ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY

A church service is going on. The boys have joined in the other

students in a hymn. Charlie is the only one not singing. He stares

off into nothingness.

				BOYS

				 (singing)

		All my life 

		Thy light shall surely follow me 

		And in God's house forevermore 

		My dwelling place shall be 

		Amen.

Mr. Nolan stands at the pulpit, with the rest of the professors

seated behind him.

				MR. NOLAN

		The death of Neil Perry is a tragedy. He 

		was a fine student. One of Welton's 

		best. And he will be missed. We've 

		contacted each of your parents to 

		explain the situation. Naturally, 

		they're all quite concerned. At the 

		request of Neil's family, I intend to 

		conduct a thorough inquiry into this 

		matter. Your complete cooperation is 

		expected.

INT. CLOAKROOM - DAY

The boys (except Cameron) are sitting about the cluttered room

waiting. Charlie lights a cigarette.

				CHARLIE

		You told him about this meeting? 

				PITTS

		Twice. 

				CHARLIE

		That's it, guys. We're all fried. 

				PITTS

		How do you mean? 

				CHARLIE

		Cameron's a fink. He's in Nolan's office 

		right now, finking. 

				PITTS

		About what? 

				CHARLIE

		The club, Pittsie. Think about it. The 

		board of directors, the trustees and Mr. 

		Nolan. Do you think for one moment 

		they're gonna let this thing just blow 

		over? Schools go down because of things 

		like this. They need a scapegoat.

The door opens. All the boys except Charlie hurry to put

their cigarettes out and wave the smoke away. A light comes on

and Cameron enters.

				CAMERON

		What's going on, guys? 

				CHARLIE

		You finked, didn't you, Cameron?

Charlie gets up and approaches Cameron, tossing his cigarette away.

				CAMERON

		Finked? I didn't know what the hell 

		you're talking about. 

				CHARLIE

		You told Nolan everything about the club 

		is what I'm talking about. 

				CAMERON

		Look, in case you hadn't heard, Dalton, 

		there's something called an honor code 

		at this school, all right? If a teacher 

		asks you a question, you tell the truth 

		or you're expelled. 

				CHARLIE

		You little-

Charlie lunges at Cameron but Knox and Meeks hold him back.

				MEEKS

		Charlie! 

				CHARLIE

		He's a rat! He's in it up to his eyes, 

		so he rattled to save himself. 

				KNOX

		Don't touch him, Charlie. You do and 

		you're out. 

				CHARLIE

		I'm out anyway! 

				KNOX

		You don't know that, not yet. 

				CAMERON

		He's right there, Charlie. And if you 

		guys are smart, you will do exactly what 

		I did and cooperate. They're not after 

		us. We're the victims. Us and Neil. 

				CHARLIE

		What's that mean? Who are they after? 

				CAMERON

		Why, Mr. Keating, of course. The 

		"Captain" himself. I mean, you guys 

		didn't really think he could avoid 

		responsibility, did you? 

				CHARLIE

		Mr. Keating responsible for Neil? Is 

		that what they're saying? 

				CAMERON

		Well, who else do you think, dumb ass? 

		The administration? Mr. Perry? Mr. 

		Keating put us up to all this crap, 

		didn't he? If he wasn't for Mr. Keating, 

		Neil would be cozied up in his room 

		right now, studying his chemistry and 

		dreaming of being called doctor. 

				TODD

		That is not true, Cameron. You know 

		that. He didn't put us to anything. Neil 

		loved acting. 

				CAMERON

		Believe what you want, but I say let 

		Keating fry. I mean, why ruin our lives?

Charlie lunges at Cameron again and punches him in the face.

Cameron falls to the floor as the boys pull Charlie away. Cameron

lifts a hand to his bloody nose.

				CAMERON

		You just signed your expulsion papers, 

		Nuwanda.

Cameron rises to his feet.

				CAMERON

		And if the rest of you are smart, you'll 

		do exactly what I did. They know 

		everything anyway. You can't save 

		Keating, but you can save yourselves.

Cameron walks away, closing the door behind him.

INT. TODD'S ROOM - DAY

Todd looks out the window and watches as Hager escorts Meeks back

to the dorm. Inside the room, Neil's bed has been stripped of all

its bedding.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Meeks walks slowly to his room. Hager remains standing at the end of

the hallway.

				HAGER

		Knox Overstreet.

Knox emerges from his room and goes to joing Hager. He gives a thumbs

up to Todd as he passes his door. Once he leaves with Hager, Todd goes

over to Meeks' door.

				TODD

		Meeks? 

				MEEKS

		Go away. I have to study. 

				TODD

		What happened to Nuwanda? 

				MEEKS

		Expelled. 

				TODD

		What'd you tell 'em? 

				MEEKS

		Nothing they didn't already know. 

				HAGER (O.S.)

		Todd Anderson.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Todd is lead up the steps to Mr. Nolan's office by Hager.

INT. NOLAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Todd enters the room to see his mother and father seated opposite

Mr. Nolan's desk.

				MR. ANDERSON

		Hello, son. 

				MRS. ANDERSON

		Hello, darling. 

				TODD

		Mom.

THe door closes behind Todd. He remains standing, not knowing

what to do.

				MR. NOLAN

		Have a seat, Mr. Anderson.

Todd sits down next to his parents.

				MR. NOLAN

		Mr. Anderson, I think we've pretty well 

		put together what's happened here. You 

		do admit to being a part of this Dead 

		Poets Society?

Todd says nothing.

				MR. ANDERSON

		Answer him, Todd. 

				TODD

		Yes, sir.

Mr. Nolan puts his glasses on and glances at a paper before him

before removing his glasses once more.

				MR. NOLAN

		I have here a detailed description of 

		what occurred at your meetings. It 

		describes how your teacher, Mr. Keating, 

		encouraged you boys to organize this 

		club and to use it as a source of 

		inspiration for reckless and self-

		indulgent behavior. It describes how Mr. 

		Keating, both in and out of the 

		classroom, encouraged Neil Perry to 

		follow his obsession with acting when he 

		knew all along it was against the 

		explicit order of Neil's parents. It was 

		Mr. Keating's blatant abuse of his 

		position as teacher that led directly to 

		Neil Perry's death. 

Mr. Nolan motions to Todd's father, who passes along a sheet of

paper to Todd.

				MR. NOLAN

		Read that document carefully, Todd. Very 

		carefully.

Todd looks at the paper, which already contains the signatures of

the other four boys.

				MR. NOLAN

		If you've nothing to add or amend, sign 

		it. 

				TODD

		What's gonna happen to Mr. Keating? 

				MR. ANDERSON

		I've had enough. Sign the paper, Todd.

Mr. Nolan holds out a pen for Todd to take.

EXT. CAMPUS - DAY

Mr. McAllister leads his students, textbooks in hand, through the

snow outside the classrooms.

				McALLISTER

		Grass is gramen or herba. Lapis is 

		stone. The entire building is 

		aedificium.

Keating looks out from his office window. McAllister pauses and looks

up at Keating, giving him a brief wave. Keating waves back.

INT. KEATING'S OFFICE - DAY

Keating laughs slightly as he watches McAllister from the window.

Inside, all his belongings have been packed up.

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

The students are all seated at their desks in silence. Everyone looks

as the door opens. They quickly stand as Mr. Nolan enters the room.

				MR. NOLAN

		Sit.

The students sit once again as Mr. Nolan walks to the front of the room.

				MR. NOLAN

		I'll be teaching this class through 

		exams. We'll find a permanent English 

		teacher during the break. Who will tell 

		me where you are in the Pritchard 

		textbook? 

				MR. NOLAN

		Mr. Anderson?

				TODD

		Uh, in the, in the Pr- 

				MR. NOLAN

		I can't hear you, Mr. Anderson. 

				TODD

		In the, in the, in the Pritchard? 

				MR. NOLAN

		Kindly inform me, Mr. Cameron. 

				CAMERON

		We skipped around a lot, sir. We covered 

		the Romantics and some of the chapters 

		on Post Civil War literature. 

				MR. NOLAN

		What about the Realists? 

				CAMERON

		I believe we skipped most of that, sir. 

				MR. NOLAN

		All right, then, we'll start over. What 

		is poetry?

There is a knock at the classroom door.

				MR. NOLAN

		Come.

The students look back as the door opens. They quickly turn

away when hey see it is Keating.

				KEATING

		Excuse me. I came for my personals. 

		Should I come back after class? 

				MR. NOLAN

		Get them now, Mr. Keating. 

				MR. NOLAN

		Gentlemen, turn to page 21 of the 

		introduction. Mr. Cameron, read aloud 

		the excellent essay by Dr. Pritchard on 

		"Understanding Poetry."

Todd slowly closes his book. Keating opens the door to the tiny

room off the classroom.

				CAMERON

		That page has been ripped out, sir. 

				MR. NOLAN

		Well, borrow somebody else's book. 

				CAMERON

		They're all ripped out, sir. 

				MR. NOLAN

		What do you mean, they're all ripped 

		out? 

				CAMERON

		Sir, we, uh- 

				MR. NOLAN

		Never mind.

Mr. Nolan takes his own book over to Cameron's desk and then

slaps the open page.

				MR. NOLAN

		Read!

As Cameron begins to read, Keating looks out at Todd as he puts

his scarf on. Todd looks at him for a moment and then glances away.

				CAMERON

		"Understanding Poetry by Dr. J Evans 

		Pritchard, Ph.D. To fully understand 

		poetry, we must first be fluent with its 

		meter, rhyme and figures of speech, then 

		ask two questions: 1) How artfully has 

		the objective of the poem been rendered 

		and 2)..."

The door squeaks as Keating shuts it behind him. Cameron pauses. 

				CAMERON

		"... How important is that objective? 

		Question 1 rates the poem's perfection; 

		question 2 rates its importance. And 

		once these questions have been answered, 

		determining the poem's greatness becomes 

		a relatively simple matter. If the 

		poem's score for perfection is plotted 

		on the horizontal of a graph--"

Keating passes by Todd and the others and gets to the back of the

classroom before Todd leaps up from his seat and turns to face him.

				TODD

		Mr. Keating! They made everybody sign 

		it. 

Mr. Nolan gets up from his desk and approaches Todd.

				MR. NOLAN

		Quiet, Mr. Anderson. 

				TODD

		You gotta believe me. It's true. 

				KEATING

		I do believe you, Todd. 

				MR. NOLAN

		Leave, Mr. Keating. 

				TODD

		But it wasn't his fault! 

				MR. NOLAN

		Sit down, Mr. Anderson!

Todd reluctantly returns to his seat.

				MR. NOLAN

		One more outburst from you or anyone

		else, and you're out of this school!

		Leave, Mr. Keating.

Keating hesitates at the back of the classroom.

				MR. NOLAN

		I said leave, Mr. Keating.

Keating slowly turns and heads to the door. As he opens

it, Todd, stands upon his desk and turns to Keating.

				TODD

		O Captain! My Captain! 

				MR. NOLAN

		Sit down, Mr. Anderson!

Keating pauses at the door and looks back at Todd on his desk.

				MR. NOLAN

		Do you hear me? Sit down! Sit down! This 

		is your final warning, Anderson. How 

		dare you? Do you hear me?

After a moment of indecision, Knox climbs up onto his desk.

				KNOX

		O Captain! My Captain! 

				MR. NOLAN

		Mr. Overstreet, I warn you! Sit down!

Pitts climbs up onto his desk, followed by several others,

including Meeks.

				MR. NOLAN

		Sit down! Sit down. All of you. I want 

		you seated. Sit down. Leave, Mr. 

		Keating.

More students stand on their desks until half the class is standing.

				MR. NOLAN

		All of you, down. I want you seated. Do 

		you hear me? 

				MR. NOLAN

		Sit down! 

Keating stands in the doorway, staring up at the boys in wonder. A

smile comes to his face.

				KEATING

		Thank you, boys. Thank you.
