1   EXT. PAPADOPOULOS MANSION - GARDEN. DAY 1.                   1

    A very English scene - a beautiful English garden belonging to a

    mansion house. A smartly turned out gardener in green overalls

    is raking leaves. It's an impressive picture of Britishness and

    order. Another gardener, DAVE is trimming the edge of the lawn.

    We see shots of the garden; plants, trees, a gazebo, sundial,

    water fountain etc. We follow one of the gardeners pushing a

    wheelbarrow across the width of the lawn and we see the rear of

    this impressive property.

    MRS PARRINGTON knocks on a bedroom door. The door opens on HARRY

    PAPADOPOULOS in his bedroom doing up his shirt in a mirror.

    A chauffeur-driven Mercedes pulls up to the front of the mansion

    house. MRS PARRINGTON, the housekeeper and nanny, waits for the

    car. HARRY and his children, JAMES, KATIE and THEO exit through

    the front door. As they do so, MRS PARRINGTON makes sure the

    children are smartly turned out. The chauffeur gets out and

    opens the door for the children.

    pulls up outside a hotel.

    A PRESENTER is standing behind a lectern, with a large crystal

    vase award. Behind him, on the stage, we see a 'European

    Entrepreneur of the Year Award' banner.

                        PRESENTER

              Orphaned when he was just a boy, Harry

              Papadopoulos came to this country with

              nothing.

    We cut to the family seated at a round table. The children look

    bored. HARRY listens proudly.

                        PRESENTER (CONT'D)

              Harry was a grafter, entering the

              restaurant trade as a young man.

              (Beat) That's a euphemism for 'Greek

              waiter' isn't it?

    There is some laughter in the audience. We cut to HARRY again,

    who attempts to smile off the joke.

                        PRESENTER (CONT'D)

              Only joking Harry. He then started the

              now famous Papadopoulos & Sons - doing

              all things Greek. From taramasalata to

              olive oil and frozen mousakas - which,

              I must admit, my wife and I are

              partial to occasionally. Not one to

              settle, Harry's made the move into

              commercial property where he's about

              to embark on one of the most audacious

              developments yet - Papadopoulos Plaza.

              A two million square foot

              redevelopment in the heart of our

              great city. (Applause from the

              audience) Ladies and Gentlemen, I give

              you European Entrepreneur of the Year.

              Harry Papadopoulos.

    Awards music. We now cut to HARRY getting up from the table. He

    momentarily acknowledges the applause. The children are clapping

    politely but absently.

    It's the photo call for 'European Entrepreneur of the Year.' A

    PHOTOGRAPHER is taking shots of HARRY holding his award. KATIE,

    JAMES and THEO stand alongside their father. The children look

    disinterested.

                        PHOTOGRAPHER

              That's lovely. (Referring to the

              vase) Now just hold it up a bit for

              me. Yeah, that's nice. Bunch up a

              bit.

                        HARRY

              Just look at the camera.

                        PHOTOGRAPHER

              A little bit more. Perfect. Now

              touch the vase for me, if you don't

              mind.

              Daddy?

              A long time ago. Touch it.

                        PHOTOGRAPHER

              Guys. This is supposed to be a

              celebration. What's the Greek word? Is

              it Opa? Opa?

                        HARRY

              Touch the vase.

    Dave doesn't answer.

              if you were worked for my company

              you'd probably be fired.

                        HARRY

              James? Can I come in?

    JAMES' room resembles a botanical garden. JAMES is at his desk

    with pots of plants and various tools and test tubes with soil

    and desk lamps. JAMES looks through a microscope, studying a

    leaf, ignoring his father. HARRY surveys the room trying to

    accommodate his son's interest in botany. He notices a poster of

    Charles Darwin with a quote. He reads it out.

                        HARRY(CONT'D)

              It is not the strongest to survive,

              nor the most intelligent but those

              adaptable to change. Fascinating.

              random plant) Ah. Look at that. (Beat)

              And that's...

    JAMES answers without looking up from the microscope.

                        JAMES

              Did you know, that the average garden

              contains over three and a half million

              species?

              But it's only a year and then you've

              got a law degree.

                        JAMES

              I've no intention of running P.. P..

              Papadopoulos & Sons. I can't even

              pronounce it.

                        HARRY

              Look. Finish your studies. The plants.

              It's a hobby. Sure. Give yourself

              options. You may change your mind

              about the business. You know, there

              are a lot of creative roles now in

              business.

                           JAMES

              Like what?

                        HARRY

              Like marketing. Alright. Defer the

              final year. Take a year out, why not?

              Fine. But don't quit. Your mother

              would have said the same.

                           JAMES

              Would she?

                         HARRY

              Well, your mother would probably have

              said do what you feel was right but

              I'd argue she was wrong. And then we'd

              argue. Probably. And she'd win. That

              was your mother. At least consider

              deferring.

    JAMES thinks about it.

                        JAMES

              Okay. I'll consider deferring.

                        HARRY

              Yeah? Great. Great. So, there you are,

              it's not a definitely not?

    HARRY wants to bond but doesn't know where to start. HARRY

    latches onto an English Ivy in a Union Jack plant pot.

                        HARRY (CONT'D)

              What's this one called?

               It's not even a building site yet.

                         SOPHIE

               So, its bankruptcy.

                         ROB

               Put something offshore, I said. He

               wanted to pay his taxes.

                         HARRY

               Maybe I should have been more Greek

               about it.

                         ROB

               Hey. It's bankruptcy baby. Not

               disaster.

               Accountants. When it's good, they get

               paid. When it's bad, they get paid. I

               want my son to be a lawyer for the

               same reason. He doesn't get it. So

               what are the options?

                         ROB

               Well, the obvious is to buy back your

               own business.

                         SOPHIE

               Trick is finding the investors to back

               you.

                         HARRY

               And the banks will sell back to me

               because?

                         ROB

               Because nobody makes pink slop like

               you do Harry.

                         SOPHIE

               The banks just want a quick sale. They

               have no interest in running your

               business.

                         HARRY

               Let's jump on it.

                         ROB

               I'll talk to private equity firms,

               VCs, angels. The usual suspects. We'll

               find someone.

                         SOPHIE

               What doesn't break you, makes you.

                         HARRY

               Ah. Therapy. Don't charge me for

               that, will you? Rob? Don't let her

               charge me for that.

     Music continues. We see the front of the house. A standard

     removal truck is parked outside alongside the Mercedes and a

     Bentley sports car - displaying (PAPA 1 and PAPA 2 number

     plates). Two removal men in white overalls and white gloves

     (almost forensic looking) walk out the front door carrying a

     large oil painting. A third man stands at the back of the van

     waiting to receive goods.

     The family, including MRS PARRINGTON, are in the kitchen.

     THEO is on his laptop. KATIE nervously files her nails. MRS

     PARRINGTON has made everyone a cup of tea. HARRY is reading a

     newspaper. JAMES is reading a book. KATIE enters.

                         KATIE

               They're going through my things. It's

               disgusting.

               Are they darling. It's temporary.

               You'll get it all back.

     Two bank assessors RUPERT and NIGEL enter. RUPERT has a

               That is quite unnecessary Katie.

                         RUPERT

               We may as well do this now. That's a

               nice computer. Oh, don't worry we're

               not going to, you know, take it...

               now. Anything interesting?

     THEO hisses at RUPERT like a snake with an aggressive face.

               Sorry.

                         RUPERT

               There's no easy way of doing this.

                         NIGEL

               You have impeccable taste, by the way.

                         MRS PARRINGTON

               It's not mine.

                         RUPERT

               We operate very strict guidelines.

               My Westwood Gold Label cost more than

               Well, the bank is unable to seize it

               as an asset because of its co-

               ownership with a... Spiros

               Papadopoulos?

18   INT. PAPADOPOULOS MANSION - DINING ROOM. EVENING 4.        18

     The family is sitting at the dining room table watching SPIROS

     eat. No one else is eating and the table is set for one. The

     dining room is spartan - less furniture/ no pictures. We see

     some tea crates stuffed with tissue wrapped objects.

                          SPIROS

               It was so strange. Oh, James - more

               lemon son.

     JAMES passes SPIROS a small plate of quartered lemons. SPIROS

     sticks his fork into one and squeezes juice over his chicken.

               mother. A little Englishman.

                         THEO

               That's because my Mummy was English.

                         SPIROS

               Ah! I know re! I know. Ah. So! I'm

               you know, I don't have much money.

                         HARRY

               I don't want your money Spiro. I want

               to sell the Three Brothers. We'll

               split it 50/50. I get enough money pay

               the rent, pay a few bills off and it's

               great for you because you get some

               cash to do whatever it is you want to

               do.

                         SPIROS

               You can't sell the Three Brothers.

                         HARRY

               I knew it! I knew you'd be

               difficult. I knew it, I knew it, I

               knew it. You haven't changed.

                         SPIROS

               No, it doesn't feel right.

                         HARRY

               You're loving this.

                         SPIROS

               No Harry. I want to help.

                         HARRY

               Can't you see we're in the shit?

                         MRS PARRINGTON

               Gentlemen, please. May I suggest we

               sleep on this? Before it gets out of

               hand.

                         SPIROS

               Yeah. This is good advice Mrs P.

                         MRS PARRINGTON

               Harry? Harry?

                         HARRY

               Okay. Whatever.

20   INT. PAPADOPOULOS MANSION - LIVING ROOM. DAY 5.            20

     HARRY, JAMES, KATIE, THEO and MRS PARRINGTON are sitting on a

     sofa. SPIROS addresses them.

                         SPIROS

               I couldn't sleep last night. Not a

               wink. Over and over, in my mind, I

               was trying to imagine selling the

               shop. Something here was saying,

               no, no. I want to help you. All of

               you. So I prayed for guidance. I

               asked the Universe. Please help me.

               Please help me help these people.

               And I must've fallen asleep not

               long after. A crazy sleep. And then

               this dream. Banayia mou. There was

               this, this music. The most

               incredible music. And you and me

               Harry. Running the shop. I woke

               with tears in my eyes and I knew.

                         HARRY

               Sorry. What are you going on about?

                         SPIROS

               We are going to reopen the Three

               Brothers.

                            THEO

               Brilliant!

                         KATIE

               Is he talking about us?

                         JAMES

               Yeah, I think he is.

                         HARRY

               There's nothing there.

                         SPIROS

               Exactly. It's empty. Useless. We'd get

               nothing for it. But if we made the

               Three Brothers great again. Hey! That

               is our destiny! Okay. It needs work.

               Sure. But destiny need work.

                         HARRY

               You're still crazy.

               We have. You. You have a better chance

               of getting through this if we increase

               the value of the shop.

                         HARRY

               I'm not opening a fish and chip shop,

               I'm Papadopoulos & Sons, I'm on

               supermarket shelves.

                         KATIE

               God. What would I tell my friends?

                         JAMES

               Don't know, maybe the truth?

                         KATIE

               (Mimicking) I don't know, maybe the

               truth.

                         JAMES

               God. Fuck off.

                         KATIE

               F.. f.. fuck you.

               Enough!

                         SPIROS

               People! Hear me out. If we get it up

               and running again, we can sell it as a

               going concern instead of an empty

               shop. This deal you're working on

               could take ages. In the meantime,

               you're getting cash in and you're

               saving money because it's got two

               bedrooms. Eh? The Three Brothers is a

               goldmine. Used to be. Can be again.

                         HARRY

               When did you become so practical?

                         SPIROS

               I'll get it fixed. I'm a handyman now.

                         MRS PARRINGTON

               I thought you were a waiter Spiros.

                         SPIROS

               Around too much booze Mrs P. I went

               travelling. Belgium, America,

               Brooklyn. I ended up managing a block

               of apartments in LA. I do painting,

               decorating, plumbing, electrics,

               everything.

                         HARRY

               You're out of your mind. I know

               what you're up to. You want to make

               some money for yourself. That's

               fine. It's okay. It's okay. At

               least you're thinking smart these

               days. But don't involve us in all

               this.

                         SPIROS

               I want to help.

                         MRS PARRINGTON

               Given the current situation, I think

               it's worth consideration.

               drums. He's a waiter. He'll drive us

               all mad and leave us broke.

               He seems reformed to me. He doesn't

               drink anymore. I think he wants to

               help.

                         HARRY

               Moving back to a chip shop will

               destroy my children's confidence.

               Seeing you behave like a spoilt brat

     then we can't fix it. That's honesty!" The logo is a hammer

               need to know if this is going to work.

               Rest assured. We'll be driving the

               patre, Spiritu, Sanctu... etc, etc.

               Got to love a downturn.

     ROB exits. SOPHIE starts to pack her files.

                         SOPHIE

               I think what you're currently doing

               with your brother sounds liberating.

                         HARRY

               I'm liberating myself of my last 25

               grand on a disused chip shop.

                          SOPHIE

               But its like a startup. Isn't that the

               most exciting phase of any venture?

               Taking a bit of a risk. Developing

               your products and your services.

               Learning about your market. Look, some

               of the largest companies on the planet

               never make a profit. Like a real

               profit. It's all accounting tricks and

               leveraged debt. What I'm trying to say

               is, does it matter if the business is

               a small one? As long as it makes a

               profit and the people who work there

               are happy?

                          HARRY

               What are you doing working in a place

               like this?

                         SOPHIE

               This is only temporary. I got divorced

               recently. Came to London for a fresh

               start. I'm actually looking into

               setting up my own business.

                         HARRY

               Well, I'm sorry about that. About the

               divorce, I mean. Not...

               I've been meaning to ask. Can I

               come and visit your shop sometime?

                         HARRY

               There isn't one.

                         SOPHIE

               When it's up and running.

                         HARRY

               It's a chip shop. It's hot. On your

               feet all hours. Verbal abuse from

               customers on a Friday night.

                         SOPHIE

               I wasn't applying for a job Harry.

               Just wanted to stop by.

     THEO is in bed on his laptop. SPIROS knocks and enters.

                         SPIROS

               It's late. What are you doing little

               man?

                         THEO

               Trading. I watch trends. Making trades

               based on patterns. I don't even look

               at the fundamentals.

                         SPIROS

               The fundamentals?

                         THEO

               You know, capital employed, gearing

               ratios etc. Not even turnover or

               profit. It's short term, but I can

               spot a trend. I know what's going to

               happen.

                         SPIROS

               So, you can see the future? And?

                         THEO

               Same as the past. The pursuit of order

               from chaos. I'm done for today.

     SPIROS takes the laptop and closes it.

               Yes. She was... She was beautiful. And

               she was very kind to me.

                         THEO

               I wish I had my Mummy sometimes.

                         SPIROS

               It's very hard for you.

                         THEO

               I'd have made her laugh, Uncle Spiro.

                         SPIROS

               You make me laugh.

                         THEO

               I've come out with some classics. Real

               gems. Wasted on this family.

                         SPIROS

               Ha! You are something else.

34   INT. THE THREE BROTHERS - LIVING ROOM. NIGHT 8.              34

     SPIROS opens the door on the sparse living room. HARRY is lying

     neatly in silk pyjamas, in a sleeping bag on a camp bed. He is

     staring at the ceiling.

                         SPIROS

               Ah, your kids are something else.

     SPIROS undresses, taking off items of clothes until he is down

     to his boxer shorts. SPIROS then gets out an icon of the Virgin

     Mary. He kisses it and then crosses himself three times.

                         SPIROS (CONT'D)

               Don't worry. I'm not too religious.

               I'm a lapsed Buddhist. I do

               everything a good Buddhist does

               except abstinence.

     SPIROS farts. Harry shuts his eyes and shakes his head in

     disgust. SPIROS then hands HARRY some ear plugs.

                            SPIROS (CONT'D)

               Ear plugs.

     SPIROS gets into the sleeping bag and turns off the light.

                         SPIROS (CONT'D)

               Oi re. This is a fantastic thing. Did

               you ever imagine, 30 years ago? Back

               here?

               No.

               Remember how excited we felt when we

               got this place? It feels like that

               again. Hey. My gut says... push

               Alaskan Pollock. Over Cod! What do you

               think?

                         HARRY

               I should never have taken out that

               loan.

               place. (Singing) We'll talk fish after

               we fix this place. Katie's got some

               good thoughts. Says we should keep the

               But then, you know. The potential

               yield of the Plaza. Papadopoulos

               Plaza. Fully developed with a thousand

               year lease. I would have kept the

               freehold. I'm telling you Spiro. It

               was good. I'd have been worth a

               fortune. Worth, I don't know. One

               billion five. One billion six. One

               billion six. Big numbers Spiro. Big,

               big numbers.

     SPIROS starts snoring. HARRY puts the ear plugs in and stares

     of people who have turned up to help in the renovation. He holds

     a bottle of champagne. Alongside him, HARRY carries the box of

     cleaning products. We see JAMES, KATIE, THEO and MRS PARRINGTON.

     We see FAT LAKI, PHIL THE TILL, FATHER JIMMY, a Greek Orthodox

     priest and an assortment of Greek faces of various ages.

                         SPIROS

               We were children when we came to

               the UK with nothing. We start

               again. Fat Laki. The weight you

               lost is an inspiration. Phil The

               Till. You've helped many Greeks

               with your tax friendly till

               machines. Eh, only two things are

               certain in life - death and taxes.

               Unless you're Greek. Then it's only

               death! (The crowd cheer). Nikos,

               Didn't Father Jimmy get done for

               you to know this is a temporary

               situation for the family. I'm

               currently in negotiations with a top

               corporate finance team about re-

     Brothers.

               You're supposed to do that after you

               launch something.

                         SPIROS

     Montage to the same music. MRS PARRINGTON picks up a tray

     with teas and we follow her through the shop. She stops so

     that people can take a mug and we see her continue her

     journey - all the way through the shop to outside, where we

     see HARRY sitting alone in the van. He's not part of the

     activity. We see scrubbing, cleaning, fixing. Boards are

     taken down. Inside we see people painting and the fish fryer

     cleaned. We see product displays go up. We see SPIROS with

     manic and crazy enthusiasm. JAMES and KATIE messing around.

     Finally, we see FATHER JIMMY splashing holy water, saying a

     prayer and making the sign of the cross over the fish frying

     range while others stand and watch the ceremony with respect.

     FAT LAKI is tasting strips of kebab meat. He is making notes as

     he does so, marking for texture, flavour etc. Around him are

     SPIROS, MRS PARRINGTON, JAMES, KATIE, THEO and HARRY.

               Hade re Laki. Tell us.

               Entaxi. Don't rush me. Its been a long

               time since I had meat like this.

     FAT LAKI takes another bite and looks upwards as he chews.

               There's a reason Hassan's still in

               business. Texture, very good. Way

               above average. Meat content. High.

               Mechanically recovered cheap

               rubbish? You wish. This is a

               quality donner, nicely cooked with

               all the right combination of herbs.

               It's beautiful.

                         SPIROS

               It doesn't mean we can't take them on.

                         FAT LAKI

               No. I'm not saying we can't.

               Well, she is 18.

                         HARRY

               We'll make a better product at a

               cheaper price with larger portions.

               We'll lose money on the kebabs in the

               short term, put Turks out of business

               within a year, make our margins on the

               fish and when the rest of this crummy

               street has packed up we'll raise our

               prices and cut our portion sizes.

               The entrepreneur has spoken.

               You know, when he was a little boy,

               he'd come home from school and sit

               there - just like that.

               Michael. He died in the fire. With our

               parents, your grandparents, in Cyprus.

               In the war between the Greeks and

               Turks.

               Spiros climbed down and Michael who

               was... six?

                         SPIROS

               Yeah.

                         HARRY

               Dropped me down. I was just a baby.

                         SPIROS

               I caught him. But Michael... He. I

               told Mihalis to jump. But he... he ran

               right back into the house. We'll never

               know why. One night and everything

               changes.

                         JAMES

               He probably wanted to save his Mum and

               Dad.

                         SPIROS

               You know what? I never thought

               about that. You could be right.

               Yeah. You are a wise boy James.

               Your soul is old. Tell me. This has

               always been a big question for me.

               For many years. Do you think... do

               you think... I could've done

               something else? For Michael?

                         JAMES

               No. You were holding a baby.

                         SPIROS

               Yeah.

                         JAMES

               And how old were you?

                         SPIROS

               I was nine.

                         JAMES

               Well, you were only a boy. Like Theo.

                         HARRY

               He was only nine. I never thought

               about how young he was.

               And you're doing that.

                         HARRY

               This is humiliating for you.

               Dad, we'll get through this. Like... I

               don't know. Like King Lear.

               I don't know the story.

               Well, King Lear loses everything.

               Absolutely everything and he finds

               himself in the middle of this storm

               with nothing and all his kids h.. h..

               hate him. They think he's a prick.

     Inside the skip among old cardboard boxes, a broken chair etc he

     up, the one with the distinctive Union Jack pot, and brushes the

               can look after herself.

     Spiros starts the van. We see it pull away. Music.

     SPIROS turns off the engine.

                         HARRY

               What are you doing?

                         SPIROS

               I've got something to say.

                         HARRY

               About Katie? Is she pregnant?

                           SPIROS

               No.

                         HARRY

               Oh God. Have you've got cancer?

                           SPIROS

               No.

     SPIROS pulls out eight or nine A4 pages of hand written notes.

     He takes out his reading glasses. Reading the piece of paper.

                         SPIROS (CONT'D)

               Just bear with me. So. Here goes.

               After years of abuse on my behalf and

               unacceptable behavior, I reached a

               moment of clarity - actually this was

               two years ago. (Reading) I'd like to

               apologise for the hurt I've caused.

                           HARRY

               What now?

                         SPIROS

               (Reading) There were aspects of my

               behaviour which were unacceptable.

               This includes, and is not limited to.

                           HARRY

               Why now?

                         SPIROS

               I've been carrying this. Well, if you

               don't want to hear we can do it later.

                         HARRY

               No. Now is fine. Now is good.

               Just. (Reading note paper and

               turning over pages) Oxi. Oxi. Skip

               that. (Beat) I have abused your

               generosity.

                         HARRY

               I agree with that statement.

                         SPIROS

               When we were children and got to

               London I looked after you. Got you

               ready for school. Made you do your

               homework. I taught you to cook, ride a

               bike, speak Greek. Dance. (Beat) Why

               don't you speak Greek re?

                         HARRY

               You were reading your list.

                         SPIROS

               I fought with Stephen Klein, when

               he accused you of stealing his

               orthopedic shoe. Remember that?

                         HARRY

               Yeah.

                         SPIROS

               Did you take it?

                         HARRY

               No.

                         SPIROS

               You can tell me now.

                         HARRY

               I didn't steal the shoe. Are you

               going to read all of that?

                         SPIROS

               I don't have to.

                         HARRY

               Why did it go wrong with us Spiro?

               We may as well get to it. Why did

               you turn against me after I left

               the shop?

                         SPIROS

               I never turned against you.

                         HARRY

               That's what it felt like.

     Spiros puts the notes down. He takes off his glasses.

               I was jealous of you.

                         HARRY

               You were my brother.

                         SPIROS

               Brothers get jealous.

                         HARRY

               You were more than a brother.

                         SPIROS

               You were my life and then you left.

               Gone.

                         HARRY

               I set up the business. I wasn't

               going to stay in the shop. You

               could've come with me.

                         SPIROS

               Harry, you were so fast. You were

               like a plane, like a supersonic

               jet.

                         HARRY

               But I gave you everything you

               wanted. Did I ever once turn you

               down? In all the years after I left

               the business. Did I? And after it

               went bust? But it was never enough.

               Every week something new. Writing a

               cheque to... I don't know. You had

               some weird friends. Who was that

               bloke with the pin head? Kept

               turning up at the house.

                         SPIROS

               None of my friends anymore.

                         HARRY

               And then drunk at Elizabeth's funeral?

               And your big 'tell it as it is'

               speech.

                         SPIROS

               I heard about it.

                         HARRY

               That was it for me. For us.

                         SPIROS

               You were right to cut me off.

               She never had a bad word for you

               Elizabeth. Always forgave you. And she

               made me forgive you. Every time.

                         SPIROS

               She did. I always had a way back

               when she was with us. Elizabeth was

               so good to me. She was our world.

               She was our world.

     Harry is chocked and is trying to hold it together.

                         HARRY

               I'm sorry, I can't.

                         SPIROS

               I've got to get to this meeting. It's

               an important meeting.

                         SPIROS

               It's okay to miss her.

               With the help of Lars and the Norske

               Velconan Bank, we aim to buy Pap and

               Sons back from the receivers.

                         LARS

               Also, I have to say Harry that I

               believe there is an intuitive bond

               between the Greek and the Nordic

               peoples, yah? And so, maybe the very

               first vikings were descended from

               Ancient Greeks, somewhere in the deep

               mists of time. And so it's so... so

               We should point out the new approach.

                         ROB

               To buy Papadopoulos & Sons but divest

               the food manufacturing side of the

               business.

                         HARRY

               Divest the food manufacturing? What

               else is there?

                         ROB

               Sell off the food but keep the

               property.

                         LARS

               Papadopoulos Plaza. It's going to be

               worth a fortune.

                         HARRY

               That's not what I had in mind.

                         SOPHIE

               It's an asset breakup.

                         LARS

               Tusk. Tusk, yah? Makes us sound like

               barbarians.

                         ROB

               With the new loan, you'd buy back your

               old assets and then sell off the

               brands in the Pap & Sons stable.

                         LARS

               Yah. And you know how to squeeze the

               value Harry.

                         SOPHIE

               That's a break up.

                         HARRY

               Please. I know what it is.

                         LARS

               a bakery.

                         ROB

               The halloumi and feta to a dairy

               company.

                         LARS

               The sell off value of these brands

               will exceed the new loan.

                         LARS

               So my bank will get its money back

               faster than you can say 'knife'.

                         ROB

               Lars wants 50% of the Plaza

               development. Which is what will remain

               after the debts have been settled.

                         HARRY

               So you get 50% of the development for

               free.

                         LARS

               Sure, yeah. But you get 50% of the

               same development yah, also for

               free.

               Guy,   guys, guys. Reality check. Harry.

               It's   not going to happen. Okay? The

               best   you can hope for is to work with

               Lars   here and save something.

                         HARRY

               I can't say no.

                          LARS

               Okay. So. Yah. I need to take this to

               the board. Take two, three months. But

               pish, yah?

                         SOPHIE

               It seems criminal to buy the business

               back only to break it up.

     As an aside to SOPHIE.

                         ROB

               Can I just point out that you are

               skating. Figuratively speaking. On

               thin fucking ice.

                         SOPHIE

               I'm sorry. This isn't very

               professional.

                         HARRY

               Do you give all your clients a hard

               time Sophie?

                         SOPHIE

               No. Just the interesting ones.

                         HARRY

               You got five minutes?

                         SOPHIE

               Yeah. Of course.

                         HARRY

               Just want to talk about the shop and

               make sure my brother's got the right

               plan before I go.

                         SOPHIE

               Okay. Let's grab a coffee.

               So it's 30% on materials. The fish,

               the potatoes, the packaging etc. Would

               you include energy? Light, heat?

                         HARRY

               Yeah. But not rent because we already

               own the building.

                         SOPHIE

               Okay. And 30% on labour?

                         HARRY

               Yeah.

                         SOPHIE

               So it's 30/30/30. Classic restaurant

               model.

                         HARRY

               That's right.

                         SOPHIE

               What are your weaknesses?

                         HARRY

               The price of fish can vary.

               Dramatically.

                         SOPHIE

               Can you vary the menu?

                         HARRY

               You don't want to complicate it.

                         SOPHIE

               It doesn't have to be complicated

               Harry. (Beat) What are your fears?

                         HARRY

               My fears? Oh. Just that it just won't

               work out. That fish and chips has

               maybe had its day.

                         SOPHIE

               No. Hang on a second. (They stop)

               Fish and chips is a British

               classic. It's much more than just a

               quick meaningless experience. It's

               something to be savoured. Just

               think of the soft, white, cod

               flakes, gently falling away as your

               fork pierces the hard, crunchy

               shell of the golden batter. The

               rich smells of a fryer's delight.

               The tangy smack of salt and vinegar

               on your lips. Hell yeah. I'd pay

               for that.

               about... We should talk about

               accounting packages.

               What?

               This time last year I was in

               Malibu.

                         MEHMET

               We'll go tonight.

                         KATIE

               It's not a nightclub. It's America.

                         MEHMET

               Oh. Look. The shop's where I'm from

               but it's not where I'm going to end

               up.

                         KATIE

               My Dad must've said that to my Mum

               once. Maybe even on this bridge.

                         MEHMET

               See. Look where he ended up?

                         KATIE

               So, what's your plan?

                         MEHMET

               Property. Got an eye for it.

                         KATIE

               I'll probably be a pop star one

               day.

                         MEHMET

               Cool.

               Yeah. I wrote something for you

               too. It's a poem. It's called,

               'Sometimes I want for nothing

               else'. Just you and me. In an ever

               expanding Universe. Sharing a cup

               of tea. Sometimes, I want for

               nothing else.

               Lovely hot chips. Come and try.

               Little boy. Battered inside.

               Special chip for you? And one for

               It's not just fish and chips.

                         SPIROS

               There's room for all of us.

                         HARRY

               What do you want Hassan?

                         HASSAN

               Remember when we were children? When

               we were friends. We weren't Greeks,

               Turks. Respectfully, I would like you

               to take your kebabs off the menu. This

               is a fish and chip shop.

                         SPIROS

               What do we get?

                         HASSAN

               I won't do fish.

                         HARRY

               You don't do fish Hassan.

                         HASSAN

               You are going to put us on the street.

                         HARRY

               It's business.

                         HASSAN

               It's not about business. Perhaps you

               would not be like this if we were

               Greeks.

                         HARRY

               I'll tell you what. We'll take kebabs

               off the menu, if you ask your son to

               stay away from my daughter.

     HASSAN thinks about this. He sips his tea.

               No. Thank you. This is very

               difficult.

                         HARRY

               Come on. It's easy.

                         HASSAN

               My son is his own man.

                         HARRY

               Right. There's no deal.

                         HASSAN

               Is this because he's Turkish? Because

               he's a Muslim?

                         HARRY

               Oh no. I don't have a problem with

               that.

                         SPIROS

               Harry's not like that.

                         HASSAN

               Because he works in a kebab shop? Is

               that it?

                         SPIROS

               Yeah. Harry's more like that.

                         HARRY

               I would ask you - both of you - to

               respect a man's aspiration for his

               daughter.

                         HASSAN

               I have similar aspirations for my son.

               Spiro, perhaps you should remind your

               brother where he is now. Tell him to

               look around. Perhaps he still sees a

               big mansion with gardens and servants.

               Well, I don't. But more importantly,

               neither does my son.

                         HARRY

               This is only. We'll be gone in a

               couple of months.

                         HASSAN

               I hope so. It's going to be a very

               long couple of months.

                         HARRY

               For both of us.

     would find in a family album or on a rotating screen saver. The

     images cover over two months of activity at the shop and beyond.

     Some of these shots are out of focus. Some are over exposed etc.

     Some are badly framed. Sometimes the people in the shots are

     aware of being photographed, sometimes not. They rotate once

     every four or five seconds throughout the song. The images we

     happy and smiling but HARRY is stern and serious. This photo

     The family is sitting at   a restaurant area table - SPIROS, MRS

     PARRINGTON, HARRY, THEO,   KATIE and JAMES. On it, there is a

     mobile phone. They watch   it in silence.

                         HARRY

               So, here we are.

                         SPIROS

               Here we are.

                         MRS PARRINGTON

               I'm sure it will be good news.

                         HARRY

               If it's good news Spiro, I want you to

               have the shop. All of it.

                         THEO

               Will we get to visit Uncle Spiros

               again?

                         MRS PARRINGTON

               Yes, of course we will.

                         SPIROS

               Who's going to help me to run the

               store? I'm going to need you little

               man.

                         MRS PARRINGTON

               I expect Uncle Spiros will always find

               you a holiday job here.

               Hello. Lars. Yeah. I'm just...

     HARRY steps away from the table and exits the restaurant area.

     We watch the family. They do not talk. HARRY comes back.

                         MRS PARRINGTON

               What is it?

                         THEO

               Did you get the loan?

                         HARRY

               Bad news I'm afraid.

                            KATIE

               Really?

                         HARRY

               Yeah. We're going home! We got it!

               We're going home.

     The family's response is muted.

                         SPIROS

               Congratulations.

                         HARRY

               What's wrong? We're leaving, we're out

               of here. We got the loan. We should be

               celebrating.

     The family are still unmoved.

                         SPIROS

               He's right. It's a good day. You, you

               made it. You're a survivor. Sorry.

     SPIROS shows some discomfort and starts to get up.

                         HARRY

               What is it with you Spiro? Why can't

               you be happy for me? Whenever I have

               any kind success you always have to

               stamp on it. (Spiros gets up) Where

               are you going?

                         SPIROS

               I am happy for you. I am.

                         HARRY

               What is it? What's wrong?

     Spiros staggers off.

               No, he's not dead. He's sleeping. He's

               still sleeping.

                         THEO

               wanted to bake something so I made

               a Greek Easter cake. Don't ask.

               No. That's really... lovely. Thank

               you very much. We'll, we'll have

               some of that. He's in a mild coma

     James exits and fetches a female doctor.

               Doctor. I felt something just now. A

               gripping movement.

                         DOCTOR

               Anything else?

               No, just a slight squeeze, is that

               a sign?

                         DOCTOR

               It could be a decorticate response.

               It's difficult to tell.

                         HARRY

               Right. How long's he going to be like

               He's suffered a heart attack. It's

     cannot remember.

               So, he saved me twice. Once in the

               fire, and once after the banks. I was

               always embarrassed by him, you know.

               By his thing that he does. You know,

               his... 'thing'. But the thing that he

               does. It's a good thing really. These

               last few months. This year actually.

               This whole year. God. What a year.

               What a year. And yet. I've never felt

               so alive. I've never felt so engaged.

               Why is that? I mean why? I mean, I'm

               frying chips.

                          MRS PARRINGTON

               Very good day. Impressed the teacher

               with his ability to solve quadratic

               equations.

               That is fantastic.

                         THEO

               Your friends are outside.

     HARRY looks out of the shop window.

63   EXT. THE THREE BROTHERS. DAY 15.                            63

     HARRY exits the shop and is confronted by ROB and SOPHIE.

                         ROB

               As you won't come to me, I thought I'd

               come to you.

                         HARRY

               I'm not changing my mind Rob.

                         ROB

               I just want to talk.

64   EXT. LOCAL PARK. DAY 15.                                    64

     HARRY, ROB and SOPHIE are in a park, sitting on a park bench.

                         ROB

               Tell me this is a joke.

                         HARRY

               I don't want to do the deal.

                         ROB

               Harry, you have seriously lost the

               plot on this one.

                         HARRY

               It just doesn't feel right.

                         ROB

               We worked hard on this.

                         SOPHIE

               If he doesn't want to do the deal, he

               doesn't want to do it.

                          ROB

               Shut up.

                         HARRY

               Hey. No need for that.

                         ROB

               I don't understand.

                         HARRY

               I've got everything I want.   And I've

               got no debt. And that feels   good. When

               I lock up my shop at night,   it feels

               good. I've got no debts, no   loans. I

               own it 100 per cent.

                         ROB

               Come on. A percentage of something

               that could be worth millions. You'd

               walk away from that? For a chip shop?

                         HARRY

               Yeah. Right now? Yes. I would. And I'm

               with my children. And that's. You

               can't put a price on that Rob. And I'm

               having fun. We're having fun. Come

               back to the shop and let me cook you

               something to eat. Go on. We're doing

               great business. I'm actually thinking

               of expanding.

                         ROB

               That's... That's... That's good Harry.

               That's, that's very good. I'm happy

               for you. If this is success.

                         HARRY

               What is success Rob? What is it?

               We've both had it. What is it? Is

               it the share price? Is it the

               profit earnings ratio? Is it a

               beautiful car.

                         ROB

               You tell me Harry. You've had it

               all.

                         HARRY

               Yeah, I have. And I can tell you.

               Success is... the joy you feel.

               That's it. That's all it is.

               Success is the joy you feel!

                         ROB

               Come on. Lets go.

                         SOPHIE

               I don't think so.

                         ROB

               Okay. I'm sorry I shouted at you.

                         SOPHIE

               I don't care about that. I just don't

               want to work for you anymore.

     Rob shakes his head and walks off.

               I just quit my job.

                         HARRY

               Yep. I think you did.

                         SOPHIE

               I'm just trying to work out what I'm

               And?

     HARRY and SOPHIE kiss.

               You may have to take a few shifts

               behind the counter.

                         SOPHIE

               Well. Got to learn the business from

               the inside.

                         HARRY

               Get the girl a Three Brothers coat.

                         SOPHIE

               I think so.

     HASSAN invites Harry to dance. JAMES hits his portable

     stereo. We hear the opening bars of Siko Horepse Sirtaki.

               No.

               Come on Harry. I want to learn to.

               Teach us all how to dance.

     HARRY, without thinking starts to dance. George Zambetas

     'Siko Horepse' plays.

                         JAMES

               Dad. What are you doing?

                         HARRY

               I think I'm going to dance. And then

               I'll teach you all.

               It's been such a long time since I

               did this. Amazing how it all comes

               back to you. Oh... This is!

     HARRY starts to clap to the music. The others start to clap and

     form a circle around him. Everyone enjoys the audacity of what

     HARRY is doing as he starts to dance by himself. People passing

     by stop to witness the spectacle. HARRY is in the middle,

     dancing by himself. The camera pulls back as the party of people

     clapping come together in a circular farandole which takes over

     the street.

               He's making the most delightful fool

     THEO jumps down and runs out. We pick up the screen of THEO's
