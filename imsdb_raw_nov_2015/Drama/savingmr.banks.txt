          EXT. MARYBOROUGH PARK - AUSTRALIA - DAY (1906)

                         OVER BLACK:

          MUSIC - string violins treat us to a familiar song opening

          and then a voice - male.

           TRAVERS (V.O.)

                          (SINGING)

           Winds in the East

           Mist coming in--

                         FADE IN:

          A whoosh of wind spins us around in a blue sky, spinning,

          spinning until we slow to a stop and find ourselves amongst

          white fluffy clouds. A shadow (oddly shaped like an umbrella)

          dances amongst the nimbus.

           TRAVERS (V.O.)

           --Like something is brewing,

           about to begin--

          The shadow's direction becomes purposeful - taking us down

          through the clouds, whipping us on the wind towards a small

          town in the distance.

           TRAVERS (V.O.)

           --Can't put me finger on what lies

                          IN STORE--

          Downwards and downwards until it skittishly circles a large,

          bustling park and then swoops us into the lavish gardens.

          There, a ten-year-old girl plays in the lush grass; she puts

          the finishing touches to a miniature version of the large

          park she sits in - benches made from twigs, trees from

          flowers, picnic cups from acorns - and gives a satisfied nod.

          She wraps her arms tightly around her chest, lifts her face

          to the sky, a half-smile threatening to break across her

          concentrated face. This is the young P.L. TRAVERS (whom we

          will also know as GINTY.)

           TRAVERS (V.O.)

           --But I feel what's to happen, all

                          HAPPENED BEFORE--

          Her little brow is furrowed with imagination and then, all of

          a sudden, the smile breaks free as something in her mind

          becomes real.

          INT. SHAWFIELD ST - PAMELA'S OFFICE - LONDON - MORNING (1961)

          P.L. TRAVERS sits in her rocking chair (in the same position

          as above) arms clasped tightly around her body, face to the

          sky. Older, beautiful; striking blue eyes aid her air of

          stiff and steely determination.

          Her office is a canvas of a life well travelled. Buddha

          smiles from every corner, framed poetry and letters adorn the

          walls alongside pictures of Pamela throughout the years with

          men we will not come to know and everywhere, china hens sit

          on shelves, their wings clasped to their chests, brooding.

          Despite the multitude of objects, the room is peaceful,

          white.

          Downstairs the doorbell rings.

          Pamela closes her eyes, breathes.

          It rings again, Pamela shakes her head, tuts. She stands up,

          smooths down her skirt with flat palms. Breathes.

          INT. SHAWFIELD ST - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - MORNING

          Pamela opens the front door and squints as a flood of

          sunlight and cherry blossom petals float over the threshold.

          DIARMUID RUSSELL (45) - bright, youthful - waits to be asked

          inside. Pamela is not pleased to see him.

                          DIARMUID

           Mrs Travers.

          INT. PAMELA'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING

          Pamela and Diarmuid sit in silence. Diarmuid looks at her,

          she looks out of the window.

                          DIARMUID PAMELA

          You're ready to--? Like pink clouds on sticks.

                          DIARMUID

           Excuse me?

                          PAMELA

           The cherry blossoms

                          (BEAT)

           I was trying to think of what they--

          Diarmuid looks at his watch.

                          DIARMUID

           The car should be here, may I use--

                          (THE PHONE)

                          PAMELA

                          (OVER)

           I cancelled it.

                          DIARMUID

           You--?

                          (PANICKED)

           What? Pamela!

                          PAMELA

           Mrs Travers.

                          DIARMUID

           Mrs Travers, please, why--

           (sugaring his tone)

           Why would you cancel the car?

                          PAMELA

           I shan't be going.

          Diarmuid buries his face in his hands.

                          DIARMUID

           We've been through this--

                          PAMELA

           I've changed my mind.

                          DIARMUID

           You can't.

                          PAMELA

           With all due respect Mr Russell I

           am on very good terms with my own

           faculty and exceedingly confident

           in its decision making

           capabilities.

          Diarmuid's shoulders visibly sag, he lets out a long

          frustrated breath.

                          DIARMUID

           You made an agreement. Do you

           understand? A verbal agreement.

                          PAMELA

           Why in the world are you speaking

           to me as if I am a neonate?

                          DIARMUID

                          HE'LL--

                          PAMELA

           He'll what? Sue? He is most welcome

           to every penny I don't have.

                          DIARMUID

                          LOOK--

                          (HE SIGHS)

           --I've represented you for a long

           time. I like to think of you as a

                          FRIEND--

          Pamela snorts.

                          DIARMUID (CONT'D)

           I like to think of it, believe me I

           know it's not reciprocated.

                          (BEAT)

           I would never suggest you do

           something that would cause you

           anguish but there's no more money

           Pamela-- Mrs Travers. Simply no

           more. Sales have dried up, no more

           royalties. You refuse to write

           further books so--

                          (BEAT)

           Do you understand? I'm frightened

           that you don't understand what that

           means.

          Pamela looks out of the window, the cherry blossom her focus.

                          PAMELA

           I know what he's going to do to her-

           - she'll be cavorting and

           twinkling! Careening towards a

           happy ending like a kamikaze--

                          DIARMUID

           --We've been trying to do this deal

           for twenty years! He's agreed to

           both your stipulations. No

           animation, script approval-- I--

                          PAMELA

           Use her to pay my bills? If I

           believed in a hell I'd be sitting

           in its waiting room--

                          DIARMUID

                          (OVER)

           --script approval! He's never

           granted anything like that before!

           I don't know what else to--

          He looks around.

                          DIARMUID (CONT'D)

           Where is Polly?

                          PAMELA

           I fired her.

          Diarmuid shakes his head, sighs.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           It's just as well. It seems I can't

           afford her anymore anyway!

          Pamela looks to the ceiling, breathes.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

                          (MOMENTARILY SOFT)

           You don't know how much she means

           to me.

                          DIARMUID

           Polly?

                          PAMELA

           Of course not Polly!

          Pamela huffs, digs her heel into the rug.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           (it's a filthy word)

           Los Angeles.

                          DIARMUID

           You have only to go there and work

           for two weeks. Collaborate. That's

           it. You haven't signed the rights

           over, yet.

                          PAMELA

           Yet!

                          DIARMUID

           You must make it work Mrs Travers--

                          PAMELA

           Oh I must, must I?

                          DIARMUID

           You need the money. I don't want

           you to see you-- (broke).

                          PAMELA

                          (OVER)

           Stop saying money! It's a filthy,

           disgusting word!

                          DIARMUID

           I am picking up the telephone Mrs

                          TRAVERS--

          Diarmuid gets up.

                          PAMELA

           I have final say?

                          DIARMUID

           You do.

                          PAMELA

                          (TO HERSELF)

           I have final say.

                          (TO DIARMUID)

                          (MORE)

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           And if I don't like what they are

           doing to her?

                          DIARMUID

           You don't sign the papers. He

           cannot make the film unless you

           grant the rights.

                          (BEAT)

           It's an exploratory trip--

          Pamela looks at the cherry blossom again, a piece floats away

          from the tree and sticks to her living room window.

                          DIARMUID (CONT'D)

           What do you say?

                          PAMELA

                          (TO HERSELF)

           I want to keep my house.

          EXT. MARYBOROUGH PARK - DAY

          A large hand taps Ginty on the shoulder, she looks up and

          smiles. TRAVERS GOFF (35) is handsome and rugged, a wild

          poetic look, like Ted Hughes or Dylan Thomas.

                          TRAVERS

           Excuse me ma'am, have you seen my

           daughter? I was quite sure I had

           left her around here somewhere!

          Ginty giggles.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)

           Her name is Helen, no, Shirley, erm-

           - goodness! I've quite forgotten!

           Could it be Prunella?

                          GINTY

           No!

                          TRAVERS

           Pamela?

                          GINTY

           No.

                          TRAVERS

           You're right still doesn't sound

           quite-- I'm sure I have a special

           name for her--

                          GINTY

           Ginty!

                          TRAVERS

           Why, thank you ma'am! Ginty it is

           of course!

                          (BEAT)

           Now, have you seen her?

                          GINTY

           It's me!

          Travers puts his nose right up to hers, peering into her

          face.

                          TRAVERS

           Gosh! So it is! Well, thank

           goodness for that! I was positive I

           was going to be beheaded for losing

           Her Highness The Royal Princess

           Ginty Mc Featherfluffy!

                          GINTY

           You can't lose me!

                          TRAVERS

           Never. I promise. I will never lose

           you!

          He swings her up onto his shoulders and gallops off through

          the park, neighing like a horse.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)

           Hurry now! We mustn't be late! The

           adventure is about to begin!

          INT. PLANE - DAY

          Pamela is hot and bothered trying to wrestle a bulging carpet

          bag into an overhead locker.

                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT

           Can I help you?

                          PAMELA

           I'm perfectly capable thank you.

          The flight attendant tries to help anyway.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           They've used all the space; so

           greedy.

          She glares at the people around her.

                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT

           I'll take it Madam. I can put it

           up here -

                          PAMELA

           I don't want it up there. I want it

           here, in the corresponding holding

           area for my assigned seat!

                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT

           The flight's closing in just a few

           moments Ma'am. I'll have to take

           it.

          Pamela narrows her eyes at the attendant as if to say `I dare

          you.' A woman, with an infant, stands up.

                          WOMAN

                          (TO ATTENDANT)

           You can put my bag up front

           instead.

          The flight attendant smiles thankfully and replaces the

          woman's bag with Pamela's.

                          PAMELA

                          (TO WOMAN)

           Will the child be a nuisance? It's

           an eleven hour flight.

                          WOMAN

                          (TAKEN ABACK)

           Er-- no, I--

                          PAMELA

           Jolly good.

          Pamela gives her a watery smile and takes the seat next to

          the window, she looks out at the tarmac.

          She closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, opens her eyes

          again and tucks her feet tidily together. She folds her hands

          neatly into her lap and looks straight ahead.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

                          (TO HERSELF)

           I hope we crash.

          The passenger across the aisle hears her, horrified!

          EXT. GOFF RESIDENCE - MARYBOROUGH - DAY (1906)

          BIDDY (3) and MARGARET - the girls mother, delicate, weak -

          stand outside of their lavish red-bricked home. Suitcases

          bulge at their feet. Margaret breathes a sigh of relief as

          she sees Travers hurrying towards them, he swings Ginty from

          his shoulders and plops her on the ground.

                          MARGARET

           The carriage?

                          TRAVERS

           Who needs a carriage my love? A

           stroll is a gift!

           (beat, excited)

           Everybody ready?

                          GINTY & BIDDY

           Yes. Yep!

          Margaret takes her youngest child MOYA (1) from the nanny.

                          TRAVERS

           Come along my team! We mustn't miss

           the train.

                          MARGARET

           (to her staff)

           Thank you so much. For everything.

                          GINTY

                          (TO NANNY)

           See you soon Katie Nanna!

          She picks up her own case; Katie Nanna turns away,

          heartbroken.

                          TRAVERS

           Walking bus!

          The family get into line, one behind the other, Travers in

          the lead.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)

           Don't forget Andrew!

          Ginty takes Andrew's leash, her own case and somehow helps

          her sister too.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)

           Ready? And off we go!

          Passersby tut and shake their heads at the noisy display as

          Travers and the girls march down the street.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)

           Left, right, left, right! Coming

           through!

          Margaret stays for a beat, longingly taking in and storing a

          picture of the home she leaves behind.

          EXT. DOWNTOWN MARYBOROUGH - DAY

          The procession continues into the bustling downtown.

          EXT. TRAIN STATION - DAY

          It's hectic as tickets are purchased and a CLERK marks a

          chalkboard with destinations and mileage. Ginty stops, looks

          at the list. The last city is--

                          GINTY

                          ALLORA--

          EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

          The Great Western Queensland train chugs its way Westward

          from the verdant green of Maryborough toward the brown cake

          of Allora.

          EXT. ANGLE ON MARYBOROUGH - DAY

          As it disappears. Ginty stands on the last train platform,

          watching her home, her past, fade into the distance.

          Ginty's face speaks resignation as it, and the train, recede

          as billowing white smoke and dust fill the frame.

          INT. PLANE - DAY

          Pamela jolts in her seat, her eyes flit open. She's disturbed

          by her dreams, she flicks her hand in front of her face as if

          somehow batting the memories away. She sighs loudly and digs

          her heel into the carpet of the plane.

          INT. LAX - ARRIVALS - DAY

          A bleary eyed Pamela carries her two bags into the arrivals

          area. She's immediately hit by dazzling sunlight and a sea of

          signs bearing the names of various passengers and companies:

          she scans Paramount, Warner Brothers, MGM, finally falling

          upon her own name - P.L. Travers - underneath "Walt Disney

          Presents".

                          PAMELA

           Oh does he indeed?

          She approaches the uniformed driver (RALPH - Mickey Mouse on

          his lapel) who bursts into a beaming smile.

                          RALPH

           Travers? P.L. Travers?

                          PAMELA

           Mrs.

                          RALPH

           Welcome, Mrs P.L. Travers! Welcome

           to the City of Angels.

          Pamela sneers. He grabs her bags.

                          RALPH (CONT'D)

           Let me take those.

                          PAMELA

           I'm perfectly capable of-- Oh,

           nevermind.

          Ralph ushers Pamela through the doors--

          EXT. LAX - DAY

          --and into the sunlight.

                          RALPH

           Sun came out to say hello just to

           you.

                          PAMELA

           Don't be preposterous.

          Pamela sniffs the air.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           It smells. Like--

                          RALPH

           Jasmine.

                          PAMELA

           --chlorine and sweat.

          Ralph chuckles.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           It's dreadful.

          EXT. LIMOSINE - DAY

          The shiny black, tinted windowed limo cruises up La Cienega

          Blvd, passing all kinds of monstrous architecture and garish

          billboard advertising.

          INT. LIMOSINE - DAY

          Pamela is diminutive on the back seat of the sprawling car.

          She eyes the champagne on ice, the flutes clinking in the in-

          car bar.

                          PAMELA

                          (TO HERSELF)

           Absurd.

          Ralph looks at her in the rearview.

                          RALPH

           You okay back there Mrs P.L.

           Travers?

                          PAMELA

           It's not Mrs P.L. It's just Mrs--

           Oh, it's so hot.

                          RALPH

           No problemo! We got a brand new air

           conditioning system, Missus; cool

           you right down in no time. Just

           about make you feel like you're in

           good old Engerland again! Things

           they can put in cars these days--

           (he shakes his head in

                          AMAZEMENT)

           Gosh almighty.

          Pamela presses her fingers to her temples. She looks around,

          finds a button, pushes it and the screen rises between

          passenger and driver miraculously relieving her of Ralph's

          natter.

                          RALPH (CONT'D)

           (happy as a clam)

           No problemo.

          EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAY

          With its pink facade and flag flying turrets the hotel

          resembles a candy castle simmering under a midday sun.

          The limo glides into the forecourt.

          INT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAY

          A porter opens the door to Pamela's suite and places her

          belongings on a luggage stand in the hallway.

                          PORTER

           Would you like me to unpack for you

           ma'am?

                          PAMELA

           Unpack?

                          PORTER

           To take your items from their cases

           and hang them in the wardrobe

           ma'am.

                          PAMELA

           Young man, if it is your wish to

           handle ladies garments I suggest

           you take employment in a

           launderette.

          The porter has no idea what to say, he hovers at the door.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           Yes?

          His eyes flick to his empty palm and back to Pamela. She

          closes the door on him.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           Odd.

          She turns and for the first time takes in--

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           Oh my.

          --The LUDICROUS suite she has been assigned; it is opulent

          beyond imagine but it's classy decor has been rather

          diminished by the array of Disney gifts splattered across

          every surface of the room.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           Oh no, no, no.

          Disney Flowers, Disney champagne, Disney exotic fruit

          baskets, Disney chocolates, Disney posters, cuddly Donald,

          Pluto and Minnie toys and - taking up the entire bed - the

          BIGGEST stuffed Mickey Mouse imaginable. Imagine it. Nope.

          BIGGER!

          Pamela cannot contain her horror. She stares at it in disgust

          for a moment, and then her eyes fall upon three pears in the

          fruit basket. She stops still for a second before rushing

          over and picking them out. She turns them over in her hands

          before an enormous wave of panic washes over her.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           (muttering to the pears)

           This won't do.

          She throws open the balcony doors for fresh air and is

          greeted with dry arid heat, dust, dazzling sunlight--

          EXT. GOFF HOUSE - ALLORA - DAY

          --Arid heat, dazzling sunlight. Travers, Margaret and the

          children climb stand in a line at the top of a pathway. From

          their perspective all there is to see is a cloud of swirling

          red dust; it obscures and then gradually reveals her new

          home. The surrounding land yellow and burnt - unlike the lush

          greens of Maryborough. The house is ramshackle and meagre.

          A swayback white nag wanders near a solitary tree and a few

          skinny chickens strut about the porch.

                          TRAVERS

           A palace! Complete with mighty

           steed.

                          GINTY

           And chickens.

                          MARGARET

                          OH--

          Travers puts an arm around her shoulder.

                          TRAVERS

           We'll build beautiful memories here

           my angel.

          Margaret offers him a trusting smile.

                          MARGARET

           Yes.

          Travers takes Ginty and Biddy's hands and they run towards

          their new home. The chickens scatter.

                          TRAVERS

           (in the distance)

           --in this house you get to share a

           bedroom!

          Margaret looks at the surrounding area, there's simply

          nothing but barren land and red dust for miles.

          EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - POOL - DAY

                         UNDERWATER

          SPLOSH! A green bomb disturbs the tranquil surface and then

          another SPLOSH!

          We rise through the water to see Pamela on her balcony

          throwing the pears, one by one, into the swimmer-free

          swimming pool.

          INT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - SUITE - CONTINUOUS

                          PAMELA

           Good riddance.

          She breathes a sigh of relief and closes the balcony doors.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

                          (TO HERSELF)

           Well, first things first.

          She gathers up the Disney paraphernalia and shoves it all in

          a closet.

          She picks up her bags and goes through to the bedroom where

          the BIGGEST stuffed Mickey Mouse imaginable takes up the

          entire bed. Imagine it. Nope. BIGGER!

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           Good Lord.

          Pamela drops her bags, grabs Mickey and places him on the

          floor, facing the wall.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

                          (TO MICKEY)

           And you can stay there until you

           learn the art of subtlety.

          Pamela opens her carpetbag and begins to unpack. She takes

          from it a bottle of pills, which she places on her night

          stand, followed by another bottle and another and another.

          The potions keep coming, as do creams and books and make-up,

          the bag is endless. Things, things and more things come

          streaming out of it and once the night stand is full she uses

          windowsills and any other available surface for her miniature

          Buddhas. Finally she takes out an impossibly large framed

          picture of herself. She holds it up, admires it, takes down

          an existing painting and replaces it with her own image.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           There.

          Pamela is restless, she looks around the room, stands in

          front of a full length mirror, admiring herself. She turns

          her face slightly to catch it at its best angle. She leans

          forward and explores the contours of her face, surprisingly

          unlined for a woman of her years. She smiles, full of vanity.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

                          (SATISFIED)

           Yes.

           (answering an imaginary

                          QUESTION)

           Well, no, I don't suppose I do

           mind.

          She laughs, but Pamela finds joy difficult so it comes out as

          an ugly snort.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           Now, really! Flatterer!

           (then scolding herself)

           Silly girl.

          She turns her attention away from the mirror and picks up a

          remote control staring at it with bemusement. She points it

          at the television hitting random buttons until suddenly the

          TV bursts into life.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           Oh!

          She clicks again, the TV goes off, again and it's on. A

          housewife advertises dish soap with glee, as if dish soap is

          the greatest thing ever invented.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           Soap for the brains.

          She changes the channel and stares blankly at a man on a

          black and white screen. It takes a moment before she realizes

          that staring back at her is the charming, moustached, kindly

          face of WALTER ELIAS DISNEY (58) on The Wonderful World of

          Disney Show. Pamela raises an eyebrow--

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           Well, well-- There you are.

          CU: TV SCREEN

          Walt is ringing a little bell but no sound comes out.

                          WALT

           Don't worry! There's nothing wrong

           with your television set. This is a

           pixie bell, the sound is much too

           high for human ears.

          Tinkerbell flies into shot.

                          WALT (CONT'D)

           Oh there you are Tink!

          She covers Walt in fairy dust.

                          WALT (CONT'D)

                          (LAUGHING)

           Hey! Get that stuff off of me!

                          (TO AUDIENCE)

           You know, a little sprinkling of

           fairy dust can make you fly!

          Pamela can't help but be drawn in for a tiny moment and then

          just as quickly, narrows her mistrusting eyes at Walt and

          switches him off.

                          PAMELA

           Off! That's how we deal with you.

          EXT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL

          A tray of untouched dinner sits outside the door.

          INT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - NIGHT

          Pamela lies in bed awake, staring at the ceiling, she shakes

          her head - trying to free it of whatever is trapped in there.

          The moonlight casts a shadow of Mickey on the wall beside her

          bed.

          EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - MORNING

          Pamela waits under the hotel awning, dressed immaculately,

          not a hair out of place. The limo pulls up to the curb and

          Pamela groans as she sees Ralph jovially jump out of the car

          and rush round to open the passenger door.

                          RALPH

           Good morning Mrs!

                          PAMELA

           It's not Mrs, it's-- Oh, why do I

           bother? We're just not going to get

           it right are we?

                          RALPH

           Hm?

                          PAMELA

           Will it be the same driver every

           day?

                          RALPH

           (oblivious to her tone)

           Yes ma'am! I'm all yours.

                          (BEAT)

           Sun came out again!

                          PAMELA

           You say it like you're surprised.

           Like the sun is particular about

           whom it appears for. It seems you

           think that I am responsible for

           it's miraculous dawning every day.

           For goodness sake, it's California!

                          RALPH

           It certainly is!

          He gestures for her to get in.

                          RALPH (CONT'D)

           (trying a British accent)

           Madame.

          Pamela grimaces.

          INT. LIMOSINE - CONTINUOUS

          Pamela tucks her legs in and folds her hands into her lap.

          Ralph climbs into the driver's seat.

                          PAMELA

           (as much to herself as

                          RALPH)

           I would so much rather be

           accountable for the rain.

                          RALPH

           Oh, that's sad.

                          PAMELA

           Sad is entirely the wrong emotion.

           I shan't bother explaining why;

                          IT'LL SIMPLY

           (she makes gesture for

           flying over his head)

           Zip!

                          RALPH

           Okey dokey.

                          PAMELA

           The rain brings life!

                          RALPH

           So does the sun.

                          PAMELA

           Be quiet!

                          RALPH

           Yes ma'am.

          Ralph starts the engine and drives away.

          EXT. DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - DAY

          THREE MEN in suits wave at the limo as it drives through the

          enormous gates of Disney's Burbank Studio and pulls up in a

          very twee forecourt.

          They are: DON DAGRADI (45) and the SHERMAN BROTHERS, ROBERT

          (34), he leans on an old worn cane and RICHARD (31), who has

          a bright, sunny, almost cartoon-ish face.

          Don opens the car door for Pamela and puts out a hand to help

          her from the vehicle but she pushes it away.

                          DON

           Pamela! Good morning!

                          PAMELA

           It is so discomfiting to hear a

           perfect stranger use my first name.

           Mrs Travers. Please.

          The Sherman's look at each other. Uh oh.

                          DON

           I do apologize, Mrs Travers.

                          (BEAT)

           I am Don DaGradi, the script

           writer.

                          PAMELA

           Co-script-writer. I shall certainly

           be having my say Mr. DiGraydi.

                          DON

           Gradi. Wonderful! I welcome it.

                          PAMELA

           If indeed we ever sign off on a

           script.

          Bob and Dick flash each other a look. What the fu ?

                          DON

           Uh. Okay, so this is the rest of

           your team, Dick and Bob Sherman!

           Music and lyrics.

                          (TO SHERMANS)

           Boys, this is the one and only Mrs

           P.L. Travers, creator of our

           beloved Mary.

                          PAMELA

           Poppins.

                          DON

           Who else?

                          PAMELA

           Mary Poppins. Never ever just Mary.

           (to Dick and Bob)

           A pleasure to meet you, though I

           fear we shan't be acquainted for

           too long.

                          BOB

           Excuse me?

                          PAMELA

           These books simply do not lend

           themselves to chirping and

           prancing. No. Certainly not a

           musical. Now, where is Mister

           Disney? I'd very much like to get

           this started and finished as

           briskly as is humanly possible.

                          BOB

           Don?

                          DICK PAMELA

          Not a music--? If you'll point me in his

           direction?

                          DON

           Uh-- erm. Ha! We had planned a

           little tour of the studio for you

                          MRS TRAVERS--

                          PAMELA

           No thank you.

                          DON

           --Wanted to show the place off.

                          PAMELA

           No one likes a show off.

          Pamela takes herself off in the direction of a building.

                          DON

           Mrs Trav-- it's a long way to--

          Don hurries behind her, Bob looks like he is about to murder

          the woman and Dick is finding the whole thing incredibly

          amusing.

          EXT. DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - DAY

          The Shermans, Don and Pamela are riding through the studios

          on a golf buggy.

                          PAMELA

           I am perfectly capable of walking.

          A couple of Disney characters (Donald and Goofy) bounce up to

          the golf cart, waving brightly. Goofy opens his arms to

          Pamela for a hug and she recoils in horror.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           Shoo! Go away!

          The characters stop bouncing and Di Gradi gives them a nod

          meaning `beat it'.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           Ghastly.

          Bob and Dick Sherman are in shock.

          INT. DISNEY - EXTERIOR OFFICE - DAY

          Don leads Pamela into the plushly appointed outer office,

          where DOLLY - a young, perky secretary - smiles brightly at

          her.

                          DON

                          (TO DOLLY)

           Could you let--

                          PAMELA

           (over, to Dolly)

           Would you let Mister Disney know I

           have arrived please?

          Dolly loses her smile at the terse tone, nods curtly and

          picks up the phone.

                          DOLLY

           (whispering into phone)

           She's here!

                          DON

           A word of advice Mrs Travers, if I

           may.

                          PAMELA

           You may. Whether I heed it or not

           will be another matter entirely.

                          DON

           Wow. Uhm. It's just that he can't

           stand being called Mr Disney. We

           are all on a first name basis here.

                          (TO DOLLY)

           Dolly! Is he--?

          We hear a man's cough before a beaming Walt Disney, in the

          flesh, appears at the end of the corridor, his arms

          outstretched.

                          WALT

           Well, there ya are at last!

          Pamela gets up, smooths down her skirt, and makes her way

          serenely towards the man, who rushes down the corridor to

          greet her.

                          WALT (CONT'D)

           Oh my dear gal!

          Pamela is open mouthed.

                          WALT (CONT'D)

           You can't imagine how excited I am

           to finally meet you!

          Pamela doesn't know what to do with this amount of

          enthusiasm. She extends a formal hand before he manages to

          get her in an embrace.

                          PAMELA

           Oh!

          He squeezes her tight and then lets go. Pamela struggles to

          compose herself, she hasn't been that close to a man in

          decades!

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           Hum-- ah. It's an honour, Mister

           Disney.

          Disney winces.

                          WALT

           Walt, you gotta call me Walt, ya

           know. `Mister Disney' was my old

           man.

          There's a hint of something mournful in the way he says `old

          man.'

                          WALT (CONT'D)

           Come here! Come here!

          He links his arm through hers, much to her chagrin, and leads

          her into his interior office past an imposing floor to

          ceiling cabinet bursting with Academy Awards.

          INT. DISNEY - INTERIOR OFFICE - DAY

          He smiles at TOMMIE - who mans the second desk.

                          WALT

           Tommie, say hi to the one and only

           P L Travers!

                          TOMMIE

           Hi there! It's so nice to--

          But Pamela has already been whisked through to Disney's

          personal office.

          INT. DISNEY'S OFFICE - DAY

          Disney's office is tastefully furnished and filled with

          pictures of his daughters and wife. Framed posters of his

          films provide splashes of color to the cream walls.

                          WALT

           Have a seat, sit down.

          He gestures to a comfy couch in the corner but Pamela takes a

          seat in front of Walt's desk instead, glancing at the sign

          above it: We Can Make Them Live. Walt perches on the edge of

          the desk, close to her, gazing at her.

                          WALT (CONT'D)

           Ya know, I can't believe it. P.L.

           Travers, right here, in my office,

           after all these years-- almost

           twenty of `em.

           (shakes his head)

           Twenty. Long. Years.

          Pamela narrows her eyes.

                          WALT (CONT'D)

           Wish ya coulda' seen me then Pam!

           As lean as a whippet I was! A race

           horse!

          Interestingly, she doesn't pull him up on using her first

          name and shortening it too!

                          WALT (CONT'D)

           But now, here you are. Look at you!

           I could eat you up!

                          PAMELA

           That wouldn't be appropriate.

          He turns a photo of his daughters - Diane and Sharon - to

          face Pamela.

                          WALT

           When Diane here was seven years old

           I-- can I get you a drink? Coffee?

           Soda?

                          PAMELA

           A pot of tea would be most welc--

                          WALT

                          (OVER)

           She was seven years old and I was

           walking past her bedroom and there

           she was on her bed reading to

           Sharon, and well, they were just

           giggling their little socks off!

           (he picks up the phone,

           presses a button)

           Tommie, pot of tea please dear--

           You're a doll.

           (he puts the phone down)

           She's a doll. Anyways I asked them

           "Girls, what's so funny?" And Diane

           said to me, "Mary Poppins daddy!"

           Well, I had no idea what a Mary

           Poppins was! And then she gave me

           your book. And by gosh!

          He stands up and throws his arms in the air to emphasise his

          point.

                          WALT (CONT'D)

           My imagination was caught on fire!

           And I mean ON FIRE! And those

           embers have burned ever since-- as

           you know.

                          PAMELA WALT

          I do. Twenty years!

                          PAMELA WALT

          Yes. Twenty. So you keep I've been asking, asking,

                         SAYING-- ASKING--

          Pamela stops talking and waits for Disney to calm down.

                          WALT (CONT'D)

           I got old asking.

          He sits back down on his desk.

                          PAMELA

           What a charming story.

                          WALT

           About my getting old?

                          PAMELA

           About your daughters.

                          WALT

           Yeah I suppose it is.

           (he looks at the picture)

           They're both women now. Gosh! Can

           you believe it?

                          PAMELA

           Children grow up.

                          WALT

           Now Pam, a man can't break a

           promise to his kids. No matter how

           long it takes to keep. No matter

           how long! You might've kept me

           dangling all this time but now we

           gotcha!

                          PAMELA

           Gotcha indeed! Mister Disney, if

           you have dangled then it is at the

           end of a rope you have fashioned

           for yourself.

                          WALT

                          PAMELA--

                          PAMELA

           I was quite clear when you

           approached me the first time that

           she wasn't for sale and clear again

           when you approached me a year later

           and clear again when you approached

           me every annum for the subsequent

           18 years. Honestly, I feel

           corralled, ensnared--

                          WALT

           Pam, Pam, the last thing I want is

           to make you feel--

                          PAMELA

           My name, if you please, is MRS

           Travers.

                          WALT

           You see, I promised them. That's a

           fact. You got kids?

                          PAMELA

                          NOT--

                          WALT

                          (OVER)

           I have never, I swear, never broken

           a promise to either one of my

           Disney girls.

                          PAMELA

           Well, that's very honourable of you

                          BUT--

                          WALT

           That's what being a daddy is all

           about right?

                          PAMELA

                          (DEEP BREATH)

           Is it?

                          WALT

           This movie isn't just going to make

           my kids happy. It's going to make

           ALL kids happy! You see my guys are

           gonna do things with it that are,

           well, are revolutionary.

          He's up again.

                          WALT (CONT'D)

           REVOLUTIONARY,Pam!

                          PAMELA

                          OH DEAR--

          Pamela rubs her temples as she watches him fly about the

          room.

                          WALT

           Mary Poppins will literally fly off

           the pages of your books!

          The door opens and Tommie comes in with the tea, Walt

          gestures for her to bring it to him.

                          WALT (CONT'D)

           Now imagine! This magical woman who

           has only lived in your head, you'll

           be able to meet her, speak to her,

           hear her sing.

          Tommie places the tray on Walt's desk and leaves the room.

          Walt picks up the tea pot.

                          PAMELA

           Yes, this singing, I am glad you've

           come to that.

           (addressing his tea

                          MAKING)

           Milk first!

          Walt puts the pot down immediately like a scolded child and

          picks up the milk jug, he pours.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           That's right. Now the tea--

          He picks up the pot again and pours the tea.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           And a spoonful of sugar.

          He stirs.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           You don't mean for this film to be

           a musical?

                          WALT

                          (TAKEN ABACK)

           I absolutely do!

          He presents her with the cup.

                          PAMELA

           No.

                          WALT

           No?

                          PAMELA

           No.

          She takes a sip, he waits anxiously to see if his tea is any

          good.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           Not bad. No, Mister Disney, Mary

           Poppins does not sing.

                          WALT

           Oh yes she does!

                          PAMELA

           When?

           In your books!

                          PAMELA

           Those aren't songs! They're

           recitations. She is not a giddy

           woman, she does not jig! Singing is

           frivolous and wholly unnecessary

           for a governess, an educatress. No.

           It would just ruin it.

          Walt is baffled. He takes a sip of tea, it's disgusting, he

          spits it back into his cup surreptitiously, then coughs

          loudly. Pamela's jaw drops.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           I won't have her turned into one of

           your silly cartoons.

          Walt takes a sharp breath on `silly' and then plasters the

          smile back on.

                          WALT

           Tell ya what. You just listen to

           what my Sherman boys have come up

           with and if they don't knock your

           socks off then I'm the King of

           England.

          Pamela rolls her eyes.

                          PAMELA

           If you're the King of England then

           you shan't exist and knowing the

           little of you I do; I shouldn't

           think you would like that very

           much.

          She smirks, as does he.

                          PAMELA

           Come to think of it. That's a song

           I wouldn't object to.

                          WALT

           Yes.

          He's not sure if she's playing with him.

                          WALT

           Pam, I want you to know that the

           last thing I would do, the very

           last thing, is tarnish a story I

           have cherished.

          He moves closer to her, takes her hand, she needs it for her

          teacup, it's awkward.

                          WALT (CONT'D)

          Pamela is torn between finding Disney captivating and totally

          barking.

                          WALT (CONT'D)

           your say so. Absolutely Nothing.

                          PAMELA

           Quite right.

          She extricates her hand.

                          WALT

                          WALT

           Tape you say.

          She pops the rights document in her bag. Walt's joviality,

          his bright demeanour, vanishes in a split second.

                          PAMELA

          She stands up and smooths down her skirt.

          He holds out his hand for her to shake.

                          WALT

           Let's make something wonderful.

          She leaves his hand hanging in mid air.

                          PAMELA

           Let's see if that's at all

           possible.

          Pamela gets up, smooths down her skirt, snorts at a picture

          of Disney in a silly hat astride a model train and

          purposefully strides out of the room, a smile across her face

          that Disney does not see.

          Travers sits, looking out at the dimming sky, playing a

          mournful air on his tin whistle, Ginty curled up in his lap,

          Andrew the dog asleep beside him. Margaret steps out onto the

          veranda an almost imperceptible glance at the half-empty

          bottle at his feet.

                          MARGARET

           It's rather late--

          Travers continues to play.

           Biddy and Moya are already asleep.

          Travers takes the pipe from his lips and sighs.

           Ginty.

          He kisses her cheek and gently lifts her from his lap.

          Margaret strokes her hand over Ginty's hair as the little

          girl slips into the house but hovers unseen by the door,

          watching her parents. Travers pats his knee and Margaret

          perches on it.

                          TRAVERS

          Margaret strokes Travers face and turns her face to the sky.

           Look at the stars.

          INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

          Pamela sits at a large meeting table as Dolly bustles around

          her placing refreshments. Pamela lays out her pencils one by

          one, makes sure her notebook is `just so.'

          A bowl of fruit is set down upon her notebook and she

          snatches it away, glaring at the table which is now laden

          with every type of snack and beverage imaginable from bagels

          to candy, coffee to soda, there are exotic fruits, enormous

          bouquets of flowers.

           --ravers.

           with benefaction from this room

           alone! Ugh, It's so vulgar.

          She gets up and moves the giant bouquet of flowers off the

          table and plops it on top of Dick's piano. Bob moves it from

          the piano to the floor.

                          BOB

                          (SEETHING)

           That is a very expensive piano.

           butchered for our visual and nasal

           enjoyment when we could have just

           as easily gone to the window,

           looked out and gazed upon them

           happily minding their own business

           and very much still alive.

          Bob hasn't a clue what to say. Pamela smoothes down her skirt

          and re-takes her seat.

          Everybody waits.

          Pamela flicks her eyes at the tape recorder which Don duly

          turns on.

          Don makes the note and is ready to move on but Pamela is

          staring at Dick and Bob. They dutifully pick up their pencils

          and note their scripts too.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

          trees made from flowers, a small hole filled with water for a

          pond, park benches made with twigs and miniature wooden

          clothes-peg people. Ginty puts the finishing touches to the

          bandstand and sits back, staring in wonder.

          The moment is broken with the sound of hooves as her father

          appears, atop his horse.

                          TRAVERS

           Ahhh, there's my girl.

          The horse moves up to her.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)

           That's it Albert. Give Ginty a

           smooch. There's a good boy, give

           her a little smooch.

          The velvety muzzle of the horse "smooches" Ginty's neck and

          ear as Travers climbs down from the nag.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)

           Poor old Albert; he's your secret

           uncle you know? But a miserable,

           horrid witch turned him into a nag.

                          GINTY

           Why did she do that?!

                          TRAVERS

           Because she hated the sound of his

           laugh.

                          GINTY

           Poor Uncle Albert! How can we fix

           him?

                          TRAVERS

           We have to teach the witch how to

           be happy again.

                          GINTY

           How?

                          TRAVERS

           I'm not quite sure darling.

                          (BEAT)

           Your mother's been calling you for

           a good hour. I shouldn't go if I

           were you, she's after little slaves

           for housework!

                          (RECITING YEATS)

           Ah, I must scrub and bake and sweep

           Till stars are beginning to blink

                          AND PEEP;

           And the young lie long and dream in

                          THEIR BED

           Of the matching of ribbons for

           bosom and head.

          Travers sighs, let's the words ring in his ears, touches the

          end of daughter's nose.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)

           Do you want to know what it feels

           like to fly Ginty?

          She nods. He hauls himself onto Albert, leans down and swings

          Ginty up so she is facing him.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)

           You trust me?

          She nods and wraps her arms around him looking backwards over

          his shoulder.

          He grips her firmly around the waist and she spreads her

          arms.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)

           Gee up, Albert. Yah!

          Travers kicks the horse into a trot, then into a canter, he

          points a finger in the air as if shooting for the stars.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)

           Yah!

          Ginty squeals with delight.

          INT. LIMOSINE - MORNING

          Pamela looks out of the window at the palm trees, the empty

          sidewalks. She looks dazed, extremely tired--

                          PAMELA

           Nobody walks.

                          RALPH

                          (SADLY)

           Leisurely stroll's a gift.

          EXT. LAUREL CANYON - MORNING

          The limo floats along the windy canyon roads, cresting the

          top of the hill and revealing an awe inspiring vista.

                          RALPH

           Beautiful ain't it?

                          PAMELA

           (refusing him the

                          SATISFACTION)

           If you like that sort of thing.

                          RALPH

           I do.

          EXT. FIELD - ALLORA - DAY

          Travers and Ginty gallop at great speed. The horse kicking up

          great clods of earth as they hurtle away into the distance.

          INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

          Don DaGradi and the Shermans are escorting Pamela along a row

          of storyboard illustrations for the film. Dolly trundles

          along behind, carrying a tray with a cup of tea on it which

          Pamela occasionally picks up and takes a sip from.

                          DON

           We do find it helps to have a

           visual. It's fun!

          She stops in front of a sketch of the Banks house.

                          PAMELA

           No, no, no. Goodness no.

                          DICK

           No?

                          PAMELA

           The Banks house doesn't look like

           that! My house is a terraced house

           with a pink door, white bricked

           with a crack in the gable. The

           window frames are lead-lined and

           the flower boxes grow pink

           nasturtiums to go with the pink

                          DOOR AND--

           (gesturing to the tape

                          RECORDER)

           Did we get that?

           (to herself, slightly

                          HYSTERICAL)

           Oh dear, it's all a big mistake.

           It's all wrong.

                          DON

           It's all wrong?

                          PAMELA

           It's too grand! The Banks family -

           they're normal, everyday sort of

           people. This isn't normal. It isn't

           everyday! They're not aristocrats!

                          DICK

           Interesting.

          Don allows a tiny smile. She is right. Pamela lingers over a

          picture of the parrot head umbrella, a split second of

          something like recognition on her face and then she simply

          moves on.

                          PAMELA

                          (TO HERSELF)

           Okay.

          She stops again in front of a sketch of Mrs Banks wearing a

          suffragette ribbon.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

                          (SIGHING)

           Do I even have to say it?

                          DON

           Um-- yeah?

                          PAMELA

           Why in the world have you made Mrs

           Banks a silly suffragette?

                          BOB

           I wonder if Emmeline P would agree

           with that adjective--

                          PAMELA

           Quite possibly, looking back.

          Dick mouths `oh my god!'

                          DON

           It does seem strange that Mrs Banks

           allows her children to spend all of

           their time with the nanny when she

           has no job to speak of--

                          PAMELA

           Are you calling Mrs Banks

           neglectful?

                          BOB

           Yep.

                          DON

           No! Of course not! We just felt

           that if she had a job it would go

           some way to explaining--

                          PAMELA

           Being a mother is a job. A very

           difficult job and one that not

           everybody is up to, that not

           everybody should have taken on in

           the first place!

          The boys see that Pamela is talking about something

          meaningful to her and they begin to soften for a brief

          moment, until--

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           I will NOT have her called Cynthia!

           Absolutely not. It feels unlucky.

          Dick makes a curly wurly cuckoo sign at Bob.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           No it should be something warm, a

           bit sexy.

          They all nearly choke at the word `sexy' coming out of her

          mouth.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           How about Mavis?

                          DON

           Sybil?

                          BOB

           Sure.

                          PAMELA

           Prudence?

                          DICK

           Gwendolyn?

                          BOB

           Great.

                          PAMELA

           Winifred!

                          DON

           I could go with Winifred.

                          PAMELA

           Yes, that's because it's very good.

          She comes to the next sketch and stops abruptly in front of

          it, a split second of utter confusion crosses her face.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           This isn't Mr Banks?

          She turns to face Don and the boys.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           This isn't him.

                          DON

           Ahm, yeah, that's him--

                          PAMELA

           He has a set of moustaches!

                          DON

           In the books he--

                          PAMELA

           I told the illustrator I didn't

           like the facial hair but she chose

           to ignore me. This is MY film and

           this time around I shall have MY

           way.

                          DOLLY

           (clearing her throat)

           Mrs Travers, it was a specific

           request, from Walt.

          Pamela doesn't acknowledge that Dolly has spoken; Dolly

          flushes.

                          PAMELA

           (to the boys)

           Why?

          Everyone shrugs, they don't know why.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           He didn't, he doesn't, Mr Banks is

           clean shaven!

          Bob buries his face in his hands and let's out a long, loud,

          unashamed moan.

                          BOB

           Does it mattterrrrrrr?!

                          DON

           Bob, Bob, Bob--

          Pamela stares at Bob.

                          PAMELA

           You can wait outside!

          She points at the door, ordering him out with her finger. Bob

          is literally stunned. Dick stifles a laugh.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           I shan't say it again Robert.

          Bob storms out of the room (as fast as his limp and cane will

          allow him) slamming the door and from behind it we hear:

           BOB (O.S.)

           KILL ME! KILL ME NOW!

                          PAMELA

                          (TO DICK)

           What is wrong with his leg?

                          DICK

           He got shot.

                          PAMELA

           Hardly surprising.

          Pamela smiles sweetly.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           Can I expect anymore drama from

           anyone else?

          INT. BAR/LOBBY - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - LATE AFTERNOON

          Pamela enters the lobby and heads for the elevator. She spies

          the bar, full of people laughing, exclaiming, enjoying one

          another's company. She takes it in melancholically for a

          second and then jabs the elevator button repeatedly, relieved

          when the doors finally slide open.

          INT. GOFF HOUSE - WASHROOM - ALLORA - MORNING

          Travers faces his reflection in the mirror as Ginty looks on

          from the doorway. He picks up his razor and begins to scrape

          away the stubble.

                          GINTY

           Why do you do that?

                          TRAVERS

           For you my dear!

           (he flicks the blade in

           the air like a swordsman)

           Swish! Which kind of kisses do you

           prefer Gintamina? Swoosh! Scratchy

           ones or silky ones?

                          GINTY

                          (THINKS)

           Silky ones.

           A man must shave for to spare his

           daughter's cheeks! Swish!

          INT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - SUITE - MORNING

          Pamela stares at herself in the clouded bathroom mirror. She

          runs a finger through the steam on the glass.

                          PAMELA

           Swish.

          And again.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           Swoosh.

          INT. DISNEY STUDIOS - CORRIDOR - DAY

          Dolly, carrying a tray of cakes, stops at the rehearsal room

          door where fractious voices ring out.

           PAMELA (O.S.)

           Stop! Stop! Stop! What on earth are

           you talking about? Supercali--?

           Supercali-- or whatever the

           infernal thing is!

                          DICK

           It's something to say when you

           don't know what to say!

                          PAMELA

           Well I always know what to say.

          The slamming of a piano lid. Dolly pushes the door open with

          her foot.

           PAMELA (O.S.) (CONT'D)

           If you so much as step one foot in

           here with that tray I shall scream!

           One cannot live on cake alone!

          INT. DISNEY OFFICE - DAY

          Dolly stands in Disney's office.

                          DISNEY

           Hit me with it.

                          DOLLY

           She has a lot of-- ideas.

                          DISNEY

           Ya? What kind of ideas?

                          DOLLY

           About how she, uh, sees things.

                          DISNEY

           And just how does she `see' things?

          Dolly sighs and pulls out a note pad.

                          DOLLY

                          (READING)

           The name Cynthia has been changed

           to Winifred.

                          WALT

           Okay that'll work.

                          DOLLY

           She won't approve Dick Van Dyke.

          Walt laughs, Dolly allows herself a little giggle too.

                          DOLLY (CONT'D)

           The sketches of the Banks house

           make it look too opulent, there

           must be no hint of romance between

           Mary Poppins and Bert, she wants to

           know why Mr Banks has been given a

           moustache, the--

                          WALT

           I asked for that.

                          DOLLY

           Yes. They did tell her but she

           wants to know why.

                          WALT

           Because I asked for it.

                          DOLLY

           Right. Of course. Uh-- the tape

           measure Mary Poppins uses to record

           Jane and Micheal's height must be a

           roll tape, not a ruler, we must add

           gravi-- gravitas, she says.

                          DISNEY

           Gahd! Anything else?

                          DOLLY

           She only wants green vegetables and

           broth, I don't know what that is

           but she wants it in the room from

           now on and oh! She doesn't want the

           colour red in the film-- at all.

          INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

          Dick, Don and Pamela sit around the meeting table. Bob hovers

          by the door in a right humph. Disney prefers to stand,

          grazing occasionally from a bowl of candy.

                          PAMELA

           I've simply gone off the colour.

          Their mouths are agape.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           You did say I was to have final say

           did you not?

                          DISNEY

           We can't make the film without the

           colour red! It's set in London for

           pete's sake.

                          PAMELA

           And?

                          DISNEY

           There's buses and mail boxes and

           guards uniforms-- heck! The British

           flag! Pamela, I'm not sure why

                          YOU'RE--

                          PAMELA

           I understand your predicament Mr

           Disney, I do. I just-- hm-- I don't

           know what it is, I'm just suddenly

           very anti-red. I shan't be wearing

           it ever again.

          Disney comes and sits on the table in front of Pam and locks

          eyes with her.

                          DISNEY

           Is this a test Pam? Are you

           requiring proof of how badly I

           wanna make you happy so that we can

           create this beautiful thing

           together?

          Pamela averts her eyes for a split second, embarrassed about

          `creating something beautiful' with Walt, but quickly

          recovers and eyeballs him right back.

                          PAMELA

           I took you at your word Mr Disney

           and it seems my first stipulation

           has been denied. There will be many

           more, so-- perhaps we should just

           call it quits and I should hand you

           back these?

          She takes the rights agreement out of her bag and offers it

          to him.

          Disney smiles at Pamela.

                          DISNEY

           Alright. No red in the film.

          Pamela glances at the tape recorder.

                          DON

           What?!

                          DICK

           Walt?

          Don and the Shermans can't believe he has given in! Disney

          strides out of the room.

          INT. DISNEY STUDIOS - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

          Disney marches down the corridor away from the rehearsal

          room. He stops, turns, goes back to the door, puts his hand

          on the handle, stops himself and moves on.

          INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Dick, Don and Bob are left astounded. They look at one

          another.

                          BOB

           He doesn't have the rights--

          All three turn their heads to turn to her.

                          PAMELA

           Quite.

          Pamela smiles a broad satisfied smile at the boys, smooths

          down her skirt and opens the script.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           Now, If you're insisting upon this

           musicality you feel is SO important

           for my film then I suggest I hear

           one of your ditties.

          No one is in the mood to sing for her.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           I shall keep an open mind!

                          DICK

           Nanny?

                          DON

           Yeah, do nanny.

          Dick begins to play--

                          BOB

                          (SPOKEN)

           Wanted a nanny for two adorable

           children.

          Pamela sighs, so do Don and Bob.

           DICK (CONT'D) PAMELA

          If you want this choice (expecting Dick to stop)

          position, No no! They can't make deman--

          have a cheery disposition--

          But Dick ignores her and carries on.

                          DICK

                          ROSY CHEEKS--

                          BOB PAMELA

          No warts! Who in the world put that

           in?!

           DICK (CONT'D) PAMELA

          Play games, all sorts! Hm.

           DICK (CONT'D) PAMELA

          You must be kind, you must be Well of all the ridiculous--!

                         WITTY

          Take us on outings, give us Completely defeats the--

                         TREATS

          Bob and Don are trying to stop themselves from laughing as

          Dick barrels right over everything Pamela says, almost as if

          the two of them are doing a duet.

           DICK (CONT'D) PAMELA

          Sing songs, bring sweets No sweets!

           DICK (CONT'D) PAMELA

          Never be cross or cruel Who would give a child cast--

          Never give us castor oil or ?

                         GRUEL

          Dick grimaces (a la Michael Banks.)

           wrote that in her--!

           Jane and Michael Banks.

                          PAMELA

           Well I simply don't know what to

           say. That's the worst song I've

           ever heard.

                          (BEAT)

           Ever.

                          DICK

           Alright.

          INT. DISNEY'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

          Walt stands looking out of his window.

                         DISNEY POV:

          Pamela sits on a bench, her feet tucked together, her arms

          clasped around her body, her face to the sky. She sits

          perfectly still until the limo pulls up and Ralph gets out,

          patiently waiting beside the car so as not to disturb her.

          Pamela, opens her eyes and Ralph nods hello. He opens the

          back door for her and she climbs in.

                          WALT

           Tommie!

          Tommie appears in his office with a glass and hands it to

          Walt.

                          TOMMIE

           Scotch Mist.

                          WALT

           What do you think?

                          TOMMIE

           What do I think I-- what?

                          WALT

           You're a woman.

                          TOMMIE

           That's a canny observation Walt.

                          WALT

           What am I missing?

                          TOMMIE

           You think the female of the species

           has some kind of psychic insight

           when it comes to others of her

           kind?

          Walt continues to stare out of the window.

                          TOMMIE (CONT'D)

           We don't.

                          (BEAT)

           You'll get yourself an ulcer with

           all that unriddling. Give it up.

          Tommie waits for a response but he's still window bound,

          filled with intrigue as he watches the car disappear.

                          WALT

                          (UNDER)

           That woman.

          INT. BAR/LOBBY - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - LATE AFTERNOON

          Pamela enters the lobby and heads for the elevator. She spies

          the bar again, a few people chatting over cocktails. The

          elevator doors open but she chooses to go and sit at the bar

          instead.

                          BARMAN

           Good afternoon Ma'am. What can I

           fix you?

                          PAMELA

           A pot of tea.

                          BARMAN

           Sure thing.

          Pamela looks around at the other women in the bar, all

          glamorous, coiffured, very different to the practical Mrs

          Travers.

          The tea pot arrives.

                          PAMELA

           Thank you. Tea is a balm for the

           soul don't you agree?

          But the barman has already moved on to another patron.

          Time moves swiftly, the teapot is drained, the customers come

          and go. The barman talks with another customer further along

          the bar. Nobody notices Pamela. In this setting she looks

          like a little old lady, awkwardly perched on a stool, staring

          into her empty cup.

          EXT. BELHATCHETT BANK OF AUSTRALIA - ALLORA - DAY

          Ginty - in a rather tattered school uniform - is diminutive

          in front of the huge double doors to the bank. An upright,

          top hatted gentleman holds the door of the bank open

          chivalrously for her.

          INT. BELHATCHETT BANK OF AUSTRALIA - ALLORA - CONTINUOUS

          Ginty and the man enter the bank.

                          GINTY

           Thank you.

          A bank worker tips his hat to the gentleman.

                          BANK WORKER

           Good afternoon Mr Belhatchett.

          Cashiers look up from their posts and nod courteously.

          Ginty and RANDOLPH BELHATCHETT are startled for a second by a

          loud crash. Their eyes flit to the glass door of Travers'

          office. The etching on the glass reads:

          TRAVERS GOFF - BANK MANAGER

          INT. TRAVERS OFFICE - DAY

          Travers has just dropped (purposefully) a tray of coins on

          the floor. He has a wild edge to him, he may well have been

          drinking.

                          TRAVERS

                          (TO CLERK)

           Belhatchett. Bell. Hatchett. Ha!

           It's a ridiculous moniker!

                          CLERK

                          SIR--

                          TRAVERS

           And Mr Belhatchett has complained

           that I opened his stupid bank five

           minutes late has he? Hahaaa!

           (in a comedy voice)

           Time's Money, Goff, y'know! Time's

           money my man!

          The clerk laughs nervously.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)

           Bell Hatchett! Beautiful hatchet.

           That's what it means. And I suppose

           if the poor dumb lambs on his

           downs, are five minutes late with

           their calving, or they don't drop

           dead on schedule when he wants a

           roast, he takes to them with the

           business end of his beautiful

           hatchet.

          Travers wields a glinting letter opener in the air, stabbing

          piles of papers, filing cabinets, desks.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)

           There, whack! That'll teach you for

           not dropping your bairns on

           schedule. Whack! Whack! Whack!

          Travers looks at the figure standing outside his door and his

          eyes widen.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)

           Whack. Whoops!

           (through the door)

           Mr Belhatchett! Allow me to--

          Travers pushes the door open to reveal Ginty at his side and

          is felled.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)

           Ginty!

                          RANDOLPH

           I want you gone.

          All eyes fall upon the little girl whom everyone seems to

          have forgotten. Travers is overcome with embarrassment and

          guilt.

                          TRAVERS

           Sweet thing! What are you doing

           here?

          Ginty looks up at Belhatchett and the manager.

                          GINTY

           You said today was--

                          TRAVERS

           Ice cream day! Yes! I did! What

           kind of father am I?

                          GINTY

                          (SCARED)

           Are you fired again?

                          TRAVERS

           Ah, yes it does seem that--

                          RANDOLPH

                          (TO GINTY)

           No. No sweetheart-- he isn't.

                          TRAVERS

                          (TO GINTY)

           Just wait in my office for a second

           darling.

          Randolph walks away, stopping to whisper in Travers ear.

                          RANDOLPH

           If you can't straighten up for your

           own sake. Do it for your daughter.

           (muttering to himself)

           Irresponsible.

          Travers holds out his arms to Ginty and she runs into them.

                          TRAVERS

           Ice cream is so rare because it

           only comes from Siberian cows. Did

           you know that?!

                          (BEAT)

           Brrrrrrrr!

          EXT. RIVER - ALLORA - DAY

          Ginty and Travers sit by the river. Ginty eats an enormous

          ice cream and Travers sips continuously from his hip flask.

                          TRAVERS

           We share a Celtic soul, you and I.

           This world is just an illusion,

           Ginty old girl. As long as we hold

           that thought dear, they can't break

           us. Money, money, money. Don't you

           buy into it Ginty! It'll bite you

           on the bot!

           How did we end up here eh? Look at

           it. Barren. Breathless.

           Get as far away from this place as

           possible my love. Find yourself a

           patch of green.

                          (HE SIGHS)

           It's a chimera you know? The world,

           the bank, you and I, Mr Randolph-

           whackety-whack-Belhatchett. All an

           illusion.

          He stares across the river, experiencing a wave of deep

          melancholy. Ginty looks up at him, aware of his profound

          unhappiness, but unable to understand its source.

          EXT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - NIGHT

          Another untouched meal in the hallway.

          INT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - NIGHT

          Pamela lies in the dark, the phone pressed to her ear.

                          PAMELA

                          (INTO PHONE)

           I loathe this place, Mr Russell.

           How can a place so sunny be so

           cold?

          We don't hear what Diarmuid says.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           I meant heartless. I'm afraid a

           jumper wouldn't suffice. It's

           bringing up these-- it's so hot and

           stuffy I feel like I am being

           attacked. These odd dreams, like my

           subconscious is after me. Punishing

           me for entertaining the idea that I

           might hand her over. I am at war

           with myself Mr Russell.

                          (BEAT)

           The script is ghastly, exactly as I

                          EXPECTED--

                          (BEAT)

           Yes, a few more days and then I'll

                          DECIDE--

                          (BEAT)

           I know, I know I need the money.

           The money. The money.

                          (TO HERSELF)

           Money. It'll bite you on the--

                          (INTO PHONE)

           It's all an illusion you know Mr

           Russell? All an illusion.

                          (BEAT)

           Very well. Good morning and

           goodnight.

          She hangs up the phone, and continues sitting upright. Wide

          awake. Staring into the darkness.

          Pamela checks through her multitude of pill bottles for

          something to help her. Nothing. She groans as she drags

          herself out of bed, pacing the room, counting steps.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           Serves me right. Money, money,

           money. Bit me on the bot.

          Her eyes stray to the big Mickey Mouse. She drags it onto the

          bed with her and climbs back under the covers, clinging onto

          the stuffed toy for comfort.

          INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - MORNING

          The room is decidedly more lively, with sketches of the cast

          and models of the sets all about the place. And of course,

          the requisite abundance of brightly coloured food now

          accompanied by some healthier options - vegetables and a

          fluorescent looking soup.

          Bob and Dick are at the piano. Don sits in the corner,

          sketching energetically on his notepad what seems to be a

          cartoon sketch of Pamela Travers.

                          DICK

           It's gotta be like a slogan!

                          BOB

           Her prescription for life.

                          DICK

           Yeah! Yes! A stitch in time!

                          BOB

           An apple a day.

                          DON

           (from across the room)

           Time and tide wait for--

                          BOB

           Sugar!

                          DICK

           Sugar?

                          DICK (CONT'D)

           What? That's not--

                          BOB

           Jeff had vaccination day at school

           yesterday.

                          DICK

           Ouch.

                          BOB

           No ouch.

                          DICK

           No ouch?

                          BOB

           Sugar. They put it in a cube.

                          DICK

           Medicine in sugar?

                          BOB

           Cube's an odd word.

                          BOB (CONT'D)

           Spoonful?

          Dick throws his hands and legs in the air almost falling off

          his stool!

                          DON

                          (UNDER)

           Yeah, we have sugar.

          EXT. DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - MORNING

          Pamela steps from the car and Walt is there to greet her.

                          WALT

           May I walk with you?

                          PAMELA

           I'm sure your country doesn't have

           any laws about sharing a pavement.

          As they walk the sound of the piano filters out of the

          rehearsal room window and down onto the lot.

          INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - MORNING

          Dick is playing about with a verse.

                          BOB

           Go back to the chorus.

                          DICK & BOB

           (singing it incorrectly)

           Just a spoonful of sugar helps the

           medicine go down!

                          BOB

           Wait! WAIT! She always does what's

           unexpected.

           She goes UP the bannisters.

          Dick is confused.

                          BOB (CONT'D)

           So go up.

          Dick plays a high note.

                          BOB (CONT'D)

           Try B.

          He takes a pencil from behind his ear and marks Dick's sheet

          music. Dick immediately begins finding the tune on the piano

                          DICK & BOB

           (singing `down' in an up

                          KEY)

           Just a spoonful of sugar helps the

           medicine go down.

          Don looks up from his sketching.

                          DICK

           Yes!

          The sound of Walt's cough signals his imminent arrival.

                          DON

           Man is in the forest.

          Pamela and Walt enter the room.

                          DON (CONT'D)

                          (TO WALT)

           I want you to hear this.

           (to the boys)

           Play him what you got.

          Walt takes a seat beside the piano. Pamela folds her arms

          across her chest defiantly.

                          DICK

           It's just a chorus--

                          BOB

           Tell us what you think.

           He knows dum dum

           Will help dum dum dum duuuum!

          Bob whistles what will end up being the Robin's part of the

          song.

                          DICK

                          (SINGING)

           Just a spoonful of sugar helps the

           medicine go down--

           the medicine go do-own,

           medicine go down

           Just a spoonful of sugar

           helps the medicine go down

           In a most de da dee daaa!

                          BOB

           We'll work out the other lyrics.

                          DICK

           You see how it goes up on the word

           down?

                          BOB

           On the word down it goes up!

                          PAMELA

                          (UNHAPPY)

           Up.

                          DON

           It's ironic.

                          PAMELA

           Is it?

                          WALT

           Forget ironic, it's iconic.

          Pamela rolls her eyes.

                          PAMELA

                          (SARCASTIC)

           Bravo.

                          WALT

           I won't be able to stop singing

           that for weeks!

                          PAMELA

           It seems enormously patronising to

           me. The very sort of annoying tune

           you would have playing in your

           themed park I daresay. All giddy

           and carefree, encouraging children

           to face the world unarmed. All they

           need is a spoon and some sugar and

           a brain full of fluff and they're

           equipped with life's tools.

           Wonderful!

          Dick is completely deflated.

                          WALT

           What's your point Pam?

                          PAMELA

           MRS Travers! My point is that,

           unlike yourself, Mary Poppins is

           the very enemy of sentiment and

           whimsy. She is truthful, she

           doesn't sugar coat the darkness in

           the world that these children will

           eventually come to know. She

           prepares them for it, she deals in

           honesty. One must clean one's room;

           it won't magically do it itself!

          She waves the script in the air.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           This whole script is flim flam!

           Where is its reality? Where is its

           heart, where is the gravitas?

          She opens a window and flings the script out.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           No weight Mister Disney! See?

          Dick, Don and Bob look out of the window as the pages flutter

          downwards and spread themselves over the Disney lot.

                          WALT

           No whimsy or sentiment says the

           woman who sends a flying nanny with

           a talking umbrella to save the

           children.

                          PAMELA

           You think Mary Poppins is saving

           the children Mr Disney?

          Pamela sighs, shakes her head.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           Oh dear.

          EXT. DISNEY STUDIOS - LATE AFTERNOON

          Pamela makes her way to the bench she waits on for Ralph.

          She sits down, wraps her arms around herself, closes her

          eyes.

                          PAMELA

                          (TO HERSELF)

           It goes up.

          EXT. BACK PADDOCK - ALLORA - DAY

          Margaret sweats as she hangs out laundry whilst desperately

          shushing her screaming infant.

                          MARGARET

           There there. Shush shush now--

          Ginty and Biddy run in and out of the sheets, chasing a large

          hen that squawks and flaps its wings trying to escape the

          girls.

                          MARGARET (CONT'D)

           (to the girls)

           If you could just--

                          TRAVERS

                          (CALLING)

           Ahoy Goffs!

          The girls and Margaret look up, surprised to see Travers so

          early.

                          GINTY

           Father!

          She runs at him and swings her high into the air with one

          arm, catching Biddy with the other.

                          MARGARET

           What a lovely surprise! Did you

           finish early?

                          TRAVERS

           I couldn't stop thinking about my

           beautiful girls on this beautiful

           day in this beautiful place and I

           thought to hell with it!

           (to Ginty and Biddy)

           And what do we say about beauty

           ladies?

           GINTY/BIDDY/TRAVERS

           A thing of beauty is a joy forever!

                          MARGARET

                          BUT--

                          TRAVERS

           Buts are for goats my love!

          He dips her and smooches her.

                          GINTY & BIDDY

           Urgh!

                          TRAVERS

           (whispering to Margaret)

           I'll put in extra hours tomorrow.

                          (TO GINTY)

           What are we playing?

                          GINTY

           The hen got out and we've been

           trying to catch her!

          Travers spies the clucking demon.

                          TRAVERS

           That's no hen! That's Aunt Ellie,

           your mother's horrendiferous

           sister!

                          GINTY

                          (LAUGHING)

           That's a made up word!

                          BIDDY

           Really?!

                          GINTY

           Not the aunt!

                          (BEAT)

           Quick! Catch her before she flies

           away on the--

                          TRAVERS/GINTY

           East Wind!

          Travers throws his jacket to the ground and begins to chase

          the hen, tearing through the clean sheets and treading them

          into the ground.

                          MARGARET

           Oh!

                          TRAVERS

           I'll wash them again my love!

          Margaret look at the dirty sheets and shrugs.

          The kids run after their father squealing and giggling as the

          poor little hen runs for its life. Even the dog joins in,

          Margaret goes to retrieve the discarded jacket and sees a

          whisky bottle protruding from the inside pocket, she slips it

          back inside - out of sight, out of mind.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)

           Go Sergeant Ginty! Fell the beast!

          Ginty dives on the hapless bird, who pecks her soundly and

          scarpers. It's chaos. Travers, the girls, the dog and the

          evasive hen running into each other, falling over each other,

          cursing and laughing.

                          GINTY

           Aunt Ellie!

                          TRAVERS

           Oh she's a foul fowl!

          INT. TRAVER'S BEDROOM/CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - EVENING

          Biddy and Moya sleep but Ginty is awake, the hen snuggled

          firmly under her arm. She can hear the tense voices of her

          parents.

                          MARGARET

           --darling, it's just that um-- a

                          LITTLE CONCERNED--

                          TRAVERS

           --Meg sweet, I had a throat scratch-

                          -

                          MARGARET

           --the bank is getting you down

           again? Perhaps my sister--

                          TRAVERS

           God no! No. I can endure. I will

           endure. For the girl's sake-- Just,

           please-- not Ellie.

                          MARGARET

           Oh my dear--

          Travers weeps and Ginty closes her eyes, buries her little

          face in the hens feathers.

                          GINTY

                          (WHISPERING)

           Foul fowl.

          INT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - NIGHT

          Pamela sits up in bed - leaning back into the open arms of

          Mickey Mouse - applying face cream, then hand cream, her face

          is screwed into a twist of unhappiness.

          EXT. DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - NIGHT

          Disney sits on Pamela's bench, deep in contemplation.

          Piano music tinkles from somewhere in the building and then a

                         VOICE--

                          DICK

           All around the cathedral

           the saints and apostles

           look down as she sells her wares

          Walt is dragged from his thoughts and gets up to follow the

          sound.

                          DICK (CONT'D)

           Although you can't see it

           you know they are smiling

           Each time someone shows that he

                          CARES--

          INT. DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK

          Walt walks towards the music room, visibly moved by the song,

          a cough rattling in his throat.

          INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - NIGHT

          Also in lamplight, Dick Sherman sits at his piano. Bob asleep

          on a couch in the corner. Walt pushes the door open, Dick

          knows he's there but keeps tinkling away.

                          DICK

           Though her words are simple and few

           listen, listen, she's calling to

                          YOU--

           "Feed the birds, tuppence a bag

           tuppence, tuppence, tuppence a

           bag."

                          WALT

           That'll work.

          Dick nods, still playing. Walt makes his way to the piano,

          sighs, sits next to Dick on the stool.

           Woman's a conundrum.

          Dick stops playing and flicks to a new page of sheet music.

                          DICK

           A man has dreams of walking with

                          GIANTS

           To carve his niche in the edifice

                          OF TIME

           Before the mortar of his zeal

           The cup is dashed from his lips

           The flame is snuffed aborning

           He's brought to rack and ruin in

                          HIS PRIME--

          Walt laughs out loud, he sings with Dick reading the lyrics

          from the music sheet.

                          WALT & DICK

           My world was calm, well ordered,

                          EXEMPLARY

           Then came this person, with chaos

           in her wake

           And now my life's ambitions go with

           one fell blow

           It's quite a bitter pill to take.

                          WALT

           Inspired by someone we know?

                          DICK

                          (FEIGNING INNOCENCE)

           You'd have to ask Bob.

          The men smile, bittersweet.

                          DICK (CONT'D)

           She might surprise us all.

                          WALT

           She won't.

                          DICK

           You don't know that.

                          WALT

           I do. I know it, I know it only too

           well.

           I've fought this battle from her

           mouse and I didn't have a bean back

           then.

          Dick raises his eyebrows.

                          WALT (CONT'D)

           He was this big terrifying New York

           producer and I was just a kid from

           Missouri with a sketch of Mickey

           but-- it woulda' killed me to give

           him up.

          Walt peers down at the sleeping Bob.

                          WALT (CONT'D)

           Honest to god killed me. That

           mouse, he's family.

           Go home.

          Walt leaves the room.

          EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - POOL - NIGHT

          Pamela sits by the pool, arms clasped around her, looking at

          the stars. The pink and green of the hotel shimmers in the

          water making it look like a chalk painting.

           TRAVERS (V.O.)

           The world is an illusion Ginty.

          EXT. GOFF HOUSE - ALLORA - LATE AFTERNOON

          Ginty sits on the front step of the porch, arms clasped

          around her body, face to the sky.

          The sounds of the evening closes in - crickets, the last

          deafening chorus of the birds.

          Travers walks up the path to their home, trailing his suit

          jacket over his shoulder, his shirt and tie loosened. His

          shirtsleeves are marked with sweat. His face is a study of

          something close to despair.

          He looks up to see Pamela sitting on the front step and

          immediately arranges his features into a bright smile of

          greeting.

                          TRAVERS

           Ahh the Countess Mary Sparklestick!

           Pray tell me, what are you

           concentrating so hard on?

                          GINTY

           I am laying eggs!

                          TRAVERS

           Really!? Fabulous!

                          GINTY

           Today I am a hen.

                          TRAVERS

           Indeed! I can see the feathers

           sprouting as we speak!

          Margaret steps out onto the veranda, takes one look at her

          husband and knows he is drunk.

                          MARGARET

           Helen Goff, would you lay the table

           for supper please?

                          GINTY

           I'm not Helen!

                          TRAVERS

                          (OVER)

           She can't possibly lay a table;

           she's busy laying eggs!

                          MARGARET

           I need-- (help.)

                          TRAVERS

           She's laying!

                          MARGARET

           (her face contorts in

                          PAIN)

           I'm sorry!

          She goes back indoors and slams the door behind her. Ginty

          gets up to go indoors and Travers catches her by the arm.

          He swallows hard, eyes welling.

                          TRAVERS

           (urgent, his voice

                          BREAKING)

           Don't you ever stop dreaming Ginty

           my love. You can be anyone you want

           to be. Anyone.

                          GINTY

           I want to be like you.

                          TRAVERS

           Don't.

                          (HE CHOKES)

           Don't leave yourself always

           searching for-- something--

          He coughs to stop a crying jag and leaves her alone on the

          porch.

          Ginty is unnerved by her Travers' demeanor, she creeps around

          to the side of the house where she watches her father appears

          in the window of the washroom. She doesn't know what to do as

          he leans his head against the wall and breaks down sobbing.

                         OMITTED

          INT. LIMO - MORNING

          Ralph looks at Pamela in his rear-view, she seems weak, the

          steely fight flown away on the East wind. Her arms wrapped

          around her chest, her face turned to the window.

                          RALPH

           Ya alright Mrs?

          Pamela doesn't even hear him.

          INT. ALLORA SCHOOL - AFTERNOON

          Ginty stares out of the window, in a daydream, a paintbrush

          in her hand, dripping colour down her arm.

          She is nudged to the present by her teacher, MRS CORRY.

                          MRS CORRY

           Helen Goff? Wake up dear. You want

           your banner to be ready for the

           fair don't you?

          Ginty turns back to her painting - her banner reads:

                         ALLORA FAIR

          Around the words Ginty is painting a gorgeous carousel with

          stunning horses, one of which is white with roses on its

          bridal.

          INT. FAIRGROUND - ALLORA - DAY

          Margaret, Biddy and Ginty walk into the fairground. Tents are

          erected, farmers show off their sheep, children clutch sticks

          of cotton candy and a carousel spins with one stunning white

          horse amongst the drearier others, roses upon its bridal.

                          BIDDY

           Mrs Brill said Father's presenting

           the medals.

                          MARGARET

           (a flutter of pride)

           He is indeed! On behalf of the

           bank.

          INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - MORNING

          Pamela stares out of the window, not really concentrating on

          what's going on in the room.

                          DON

           Mrs Travers?

          Again, she doesn't hear.

                          DON (CONT'D)

           Mrs Travers?

          Pamela looks at Don.

                          DON (CONT'D)

           We were just saying that we'd like

           to play you the song in the bank.

                          (BEAT)

           Would that be good?

          Pamela nods, noncommittal.

                          DON (CONT'D)

           (as Dawes Snr)

           So you have tuppence? May I be

           permitted to see it?

           (changing voice to Michael

                          BANKS)

           No, I want it to feed the birds!

           (back to Dawes Snr)

           Fiddlesticks boy! Feed the birds

           and what've you got?

           DON/DICK/BOB

           Fat birds!

                          DICK

           (singing more sotto than

                          USUAL)

           But! If you invest your tuppence

           wisely in the bank

          EXT. FAIRGROUND - ALLORA - DAY

           DICK (V.O.)

           Safe and sound--

          A small stage and dais stand central of the event over which

          a large sign reads:

           SPONSORED BY THE BELHATCHETT BANK OF AUSTRALIA

           DICK (V.O.)

           Soon that tuppence safely invested

           in the bank will compound--

          The Allora townsfolk are out in force. Ginty walks with her

          family. Her father attempting to memorise speech notes as

          they pass through the crowds.

           DICK (V.O.)

           And you'll achieve that sense of

                          CONQUEST--

          Margaret nudges him as Randolph Belhatchett and his family

          walk past.

                          TRAVERS

           (clears his throat)

           Mr Belhatchett.

          Randolph looks at Travers, then at Travers shaking hands, his

          family nod and move on. Margaret looks upset by this.

           DICK (V.O.)

           As your affluence expands--

          Travers buys two immense sticks of fairy floss and hands them

          to Ginty and Biddy.

                          MARGARET

           Travers, Biddy's stomach--

                          TRAVERS

           Oh, for Gods' sake, Meg, stop

           whinnying like an old nag will you?

          Margaret is aghast at being spoken to like that in public but

          she keep her mouth shut.

          Ginty notices Travers eyes stray towards the refreshments

          tent.

                          GINTY

                          (PANICKED)

           Father-- will you ride the carousel

           with me!?

          But the refreshment tent has Travers in its grip.

                          TRAVERS

           Meet you there in a blink of an

           eye!

          INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

          As before.

                          (SINGING)

           In the hands of the directors

           who invest as propriety demands.

          EXT. FAIRGROUND - ALLORA - DAY

          Ginty stands with her family at the carousel, eyeing the

          refreshment tent.

                          MARGARET

                          (TO GINTY)

           I'll take Biddy to get ready for

           her dance.

                          (BEAT)

           Where's your father?

          Margaret sees the direction of Ginty's gaze. Her face falls

          but she takes Biddy by the hand and heads for the stage.

                          MARGARET (CONT'D)

           Come on Biddy.

          INT. REFRESHMENT TENT - DAY

          Ginty appears in the tent's entrance. On first glance she

          sees only an unidentified group of local drinkers. Relief

          begins to dawn and she turns away.

          It is then that she hears Travers laugh, and turns back to

          see the group part, revealing Travers at its centre.

                          TRAVERS

           Indeed, a published poet--

          She takes a deep breath and moves forward, grabs Travers

          hand.

                          GINTY

           Father, come and look. Biddy's

           dancing.

                          TRAVERS

           In a moment, my princess. I'm

           talking.

           Back in Ireland, I miss her green

                          HILLS SO--

                          GINTY

           But she's-- she really wants you to

           watch, Dad. You'll miss it.

                          TRAVERS

           Not now Biddy!

                          GINTY

           I'm Ginty.

                          TRAVERS

           Ginty! Shoo!

          Devastated, Ginty doesn't know what to do, she pulls at his

          shirt sleeve again.

                          GINTY

           You said don't give up.

          A waiter approaches and takes her by the arm, leading her

          away.

                          WAITER

           Excuse me, Miss. It's gentlemen

           only in this section of the tent.

           I think you'll be more comfortable

           at the far end.

                          (BEAT)

           Are you alright sweetheart?

                          GINTY

                          (TO WAITER)

           I'm scared my father is--

          Despairing she looks up and sees her mother, carrying Moya,

          in the entrance. Her mother's face falls and crumples.

          EXT. FAIRGROUND - ALLORA - CONTINUOUS

          Travers steps heavily, one at a time, up the steps onto the

          dais, and finds his way to the speaker's podium. Margaret

          and Ginty watch, hearts in mouths, Biddy blissfully unaware.

                          TRAVERS

           Good afternoon, distinguished

           guests, our biggest supporter Mr

           Randolph Belhatchett and his lovely

           wife, ladies and gentlemen, boys

           and girls!

          Randolph looks at Travers with displeasure and then at one of

          the bank staff.

                          RANDOLPH

           Why is he speaking for the bank?

                          BANK WORKER

           He's the manager.

                          TRAVERS

           I'm honoured to be here on behalf

           of the Belhatchett Bank of

           Australia. Shortly, it will be my

           very pleasant duty to present the

           awards to our young performers. But

           before I begin, I'd like to say a

           very few words to our very youngest

           citizens about the role of the -

           er, the Bank in our community.

          Ginty allows herself to breathe. So far, so good.

                          MARGARET

           He's using too many `verys'. He

           always says `very' too much when

                          HE'S--

          She can't say it. Ginty takes her mother's hand but Margaret

          pushes the hand away.

          INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Pamela turns away from Don and the Shermans and takes herself

          to look at a sketch of Mr Banks, pinned to the wall, he still

          has a moustache.

          Don is up and singing with the boys. They are enjoying

          themselves so much that they don't notice Pamela's eyes well

          slightly.

          EXT. FAIRGROUND - ALLORA - CONTINUOUS

          There's a smattering of applause, Travers is encouraged,

          Margaret and Ginty look relieved, even hopeful.

          But then Travers momentarily looks lost, a slight breeze tugs

          the speech notes from his hand and they float down in front

          of the dais.

                          TRAVERS

           Uhmm. Thank you kindly. Thanking

           you. Now-- what, what am I doing

           next? Oh! It's a marvellous idea to

           encourage children to open

           accounts. My daughter, the Princess

           Ginty-- she's-- uh.

           (looks at Ginty)

           How old are you? Come up here.

          Ginty - what? Me?

          Ginty glances to her mother and then, on trembling legs,

          makes her way forward and up the stairs onto the dais.

          Margaret watches, growing uneasy.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)

           Ginty has a bank account-- and

           that's good. Give her a drink!

          The audience is shocked.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)

                          (MUMBLING)

           I mean give her a hand.

          Everyone is beginning to look uncomfortable.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)

           I shall return in just a moment to

           present the awards. But right now I

           must-- relieve myself.

          Gasps from the audience.

          Margaret - dying.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)

           Give us your shoulder, Ginty, will

           you? I'm busting. There's a good

           girl.

          Father and daughter walk towards the edge of the stage,

          Travers leaning on Ginty's shoulder. The shameful glare of

          Allora burning into them.

           DON (O.S.)

           When fall the banks of England,

           England falls!

          Travers somehow loses his footing before reaching the steps

          and topples off the stage. There's an audible, horrible snap

          as he lands in an undignified pile. But, despite his ugly

          injury, Travers cannot stop laughing.

          INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          The boys are laughing, congratulating one another.

                          DON

           I love it!

                          DICK

           You think Walt's gonna like it?

          Pamela takes a last look at the Mr Banks picture and spins

          around viciously.

                          PAMELA

           Why did you have to make him so

           cruel?

          The boys jubilance is halted immediately.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           He was not a monster!

                          DON

           Who are we talking about? I'm

           confused.

                          PAMELA

           You all have children yes?

                          DON

           Yes.

                          DICK BOB

          Yep. Yes.

                          PAMELA

           And do those children write you

           letters, make drawings for you?

                          DON

           Of course.

                          DICK

           Mine like to make folded paper--

                          PAMELA

           (cutting him off)

           And would you tear up those gifts?

           In front of them?!

          Silence. They know where this is going.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           It's a dreadful thing to do! I

           don't understand! Why must father

           tear up the advertisement his

           children have written and throw it

           in the fireplace!? Why won't he

           mend their kite? Why have you made

           him so unspeakably awful?

                          (BEAT)

           For all the world to see, in

           glorious technicolor? You claim to

           make them live-- if that happens

           can't he? Can't they at least live

           well?

          Pamela chokes back a sudden rush of distress.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           I can't bear it.

                          (SOFTLY)

                          PLEASE DON'T--

          The boys are shocked at the level of upset.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           Please don't-- I'll feel like I let

           him down again--

          She leaves the room, head hung.

          INT. TRAVERS BEDROOM - GOFF HOUSE - DAY

          Travers is in bed, his leg elevated and set with plaster. He

          is shaking badly with DT's, his mood is poisonous.

          Ginty sits on the edge of the bed as the DOCTOR packs up his

          bag.

                          TRAVERS

           I don't suppose there's any more

           you can give me for the pain?

          The doctor shakes his head at Travers wanton greed for more.

                          DOCTOR

           (leaving the room)

           When will enough be enough Travers?

                          GINTY

           I've brought you something father.

                          TRAVERS

           Be a darling Ginty my old pal! Help

           father out won't you?

          Ginty is wary.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)

           In my washroom-- there's a bottle

           of medicine that father needs--

                          GINTY

           Mother took it away.

          Travers slams his fist on the bed, scaring Ginty.

                          TRAVERS

           Godammit!

          Nervous, hopeful, Ginty withdraws a folded sheet of paper

          from her pocket.

                          GINTY

           I wrote a poem for you. It - it

           won first prize, at school.

          Travers takes the page, tries to hold it steady in his

          shaking hand.

                          GINTY (CONT'D)

           Would you like me to read it to

           you?

          The agony as Ginty watches the shaking hand. Finally, the

          humiliation is too much for Travers. He scans the page

          rapidly and lowers his hand.

                          TRAVERS

           It's hardly Yeats, is it?

          Ginty is devastated. But more than this there's a hardening

          in her small face, a sense of disillusionment that so far

          she's held in check. Here are the first signs of the Pamela

          to come.

          INT. DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - DAY

          Pamela rushes from the rehearsal room, down the corridor, her

          face twisted, desperately trying to maintain composure. Don

          rushes out after her.

                          DON

           Mrs Travers!

          He stops, recognizing she doesn't need to be followed.

          INT. KITCHEN - GOFF HOUSE - DAY

          Ginty rummages through kitchen cabinets, drawers, the trash

          but doesn't find what she's looking for.

          EXT. DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - DAY

          Pamela rushes past Minnie Mouse and Daisy Duck, through the

          lot, past Ralph - who's taking his lunch at the cafeteria -

          and towards a patch of green, a communal lawn at the back of

          a soundstage.

          EXT. GOFF HOUSE - DAY

          Ginty fights the smell of the warm rubbish in the midday sun

          as she ransacks the outdoor trash cans, finally finding what

          it is she's looking for.

          EXT. GRASS AREA - DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - DAY

          Pamela flops down onto the ground, digging her fingers into

          the dirt and lawn.

          INT. TRAVERS BEDROOM - GOFF HOUSE - DAY

          Ginty creeps into her father's room, he sleeps fitfully, and

          presses the half-full bottle into his hand. Covering both

          hand and bottle with his bed covers before leaving the room.

          EXT. GRASS AREA - DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - DAY

          Pamela picks a daisy, finds a stray twig and arranges them in

          the grass.

                          RALPH

           Mrs?

          Pamela looks up, her eyes are red rimmed but she's not

          crying.

                          RALPH (CONT'D)

           I, uh, brought you a tea.

          He hands her the tea in a takeaway cup.

                          PAMELA

           It's blasphemy to drink tea from a

           paper cup.

          Ralph, shifts nervously from foot to foot. He's not quite

          sure what to say to her or why he brought the tea.

          Pamela puts the tea down and continues to fiddle with bits

          and pieces of twig and bloom that she's plucking from the

          area around her.

                          RALPH

           Everything okay Ma'am? Would you

           like me to drive you home?

                          PAMELA

           All the way to England? Yes,

           please.

          Ralph lowers himself onto his haunches.

                          RALPH

           You got family back there Mrs?

                          PAMELA

           You're an impertinent man you know?

           You ask an awful lot of questions

           that have no relevance to you being

           able to carry out your duties.

                          RALPH

                          (LAUGHING)

           I know! I do, do that. Yes!

                          PAMELA

           And you have no barometer.

          Ralph is confused.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           Let us say that I haven't family

           who'd notice whether I was halfway

           across the world or sitting in my

           living room.

          She pulls a thread from the hem of her skirt, ties two twigs

          together.

                          RALPH

                          MA'AM; I--

          Ralph sees that she has a little collection of things, he

          looks around for some more. Pamela takes a stick and digs a

          small line through the grass then hands it to him.

                          PAMELA

           Make a little furrow, there.

          Ralph dutifully does as he's told, looking over his shoulder

          for fear of being caught digging holes in Disney soil.

          Ralph pokes the ground, thinking.

                          RALPH

           I gotta kid.

                          PAMELA

           Well, most people do.

                          RALPH

           Jane-- she's got all kinds of

           troubles.

          Pamela raises an eyebrow.

                          RALPH (CONT'D)

           Handicapped you know? Myelitis-- 

           transverse.

                          (BEAT)

           She's in a wheelchair see? That's

           why I concern myself with the

           weather-- sunny day she can sit out

           in the garden. Rainy day I have to

           leave her cooped up inside.

                          (BEAT)

           Worry `bout the future, but then I

           stop cuz you can't do that. Only

           today.

          Pamela takes the plastic lid off the paper cup and pokes

          holes in it.

                          PAMELA

           Now look.

          She takes the lid, twigs now sticking out of the poked holes

          and places it in the centre of what we now see is one of

          Pamela's tiny parks, she gently rest a leaf on the twig

          struts forming a roof.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           It's a band stand.

          She takes the cup of tea and gently pours the steaming liquid

          into Ralph's trench, which runs all the way around the park.

                          RALPH

           A river!

                          PAMELA

                          (CORRECTING HIM)

           Lake.

                          RALPH

           Lake.

                          (BEAT)

           Hey! I wish I could take her there!

          He points at the miniature park.

                          PAMELA

           Wouldn't that be nice?

          INT. GINTY BIDDY & MOYA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Ginty, Biddy and Moya sleep soundly, Ginty clutching the poem

          to her chest.

          The door creeps open and Margaret stands in the shadows

          looking at her children, tears stream down her face but she

          seems calm, something has crossed over in her eyes. There's

          just nothing there--

                          MARGARET

                          (WHISPERING)

           I know you gave it to him.

           (squeezing Ginty's hand)

           All the hope is in the bottom of

           that bottle, Helen.

                          GINTY

           Mother?

                          MARGARET

           I want you to take care of the

           children.

          Ginty is groggy, she doesn't understand.

                          MARGARET (CONT'D)

           Watch over them.

          Ginty sits up.

                          MARGARET (CONT'D)

           I know you love your father more.

           But one day you'll understand.

                          GINTY

           What?

          Margaret leaves the room and Ginty is straight out of bed

          following her. Behind, in the room, Moya has awoken and is

          crying.

          EXT. GOFF HOUSE - ALLORA - NIGHT

          Ginty runs out onto the porch where she sees her mother in

          her white nightdress striding purposefully through the garden

          like some ethereal ghost.

                          GINTY

           Mother!

          She runs out into the yard but stops as she hears Biddy.

           BIDDY (O.S.)

           Ginty!

          Ginty turns back to the house and then back towards her

          mother but Margaret has disappeared into the darkness.

                          GINTY

                          (CALLING)

           Mother! Mother!

          The baby is screaming now.

          INT. GINTY BIDDY & MOYA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Ginty wrenches the eiderdown off the bed and wraps Biddy in

          it, she scoops Moya up from the crib.

                          BIDDY

           Where's ma?

                          GINTY

           Once upon a time there were three

           little girls alone in a house.

           They were frightened of the big

           wide world just outside the door.

          She takes them through the hallway, stopping momentarily

          outside the door to her fathers bedroom. It is slightly ajar

          and he looks incredibly frail and delirious.

                          GINTY (CONT'D)

           They were so afraid.

          She moves forward, her eyes flit to the front door, expecting

          her mother to be standing there any minute but there is

          nothing.

          EXT. CREEK - NIGHT

          The mud-stained hem of Margaret's nightdress sweeps along the

          ground, as her feet move towards, and then into, the water of

          the creek. One step, two, three, the water coming up over her

          ankles, soaking the nightgown.

           GINTY (V.O.)

           But the stars were guarding them,

           they glittered as they spoke "We

           shall send a guide to show them the

           way to the magical ladder which

           will bring them all the way up to

                          SEE US"

          EXT. LIVING ROOM - GOFF HOUSE - NIGHT

          Biddy and Moya are calming as Ginty places the girls in front

          of the fireplace.

                          GINTY

           And who do you think those

           sparkling messengers sent? Who was

           it that came flying through the

           starry, starry sky to carry us up

           to see them?

          Ginty wraps Moya in a blanket and puts her in Biddy's arms.

                          BIDDY

           An elf?

          EXT. PORCH - GOFF HOUSE - NIGHT

          Ginty begins to untie Albert from the fence still speaking to

          the girls through the window.

                          GINTY

           Their old Uncle Albert of course!

           (beat, to Biddy)

           Stay right here, be good--

          Ginty climbs atop the horse.

                          BIDDY

           Are you going to the sky?

                          GINTY

           I'm going to find the end of the

           story so I can bring it back for

           you!

                          BIDDY

           Is it happy?

          EXT. PADDOCK - NIGHT

          Ginty rides fast, desperately searching the darkness for her

          mother and turning back frequently to check that the lamp

          still burns on the porch.

          EXT. CREEK - NIGHT

          Margaret is up to her neck in the freezing water of the

          creek. Shivering cold. She wills herself forward into the

          water. She wants to sink down and simply float away.

          From behind her comes the clip clopping of hooves. Margaret

          turns her head and there, atop the horse, is Ginty.

          Margaret begins to weep.

          Ginty jumps down from the horse and rushes to her mother,

          wading into the water to grab hold of her.

          Ginty bobs up and down in front of her mother in the deep

          water.

                          MARGARET

           Sometimes a person we love, through

           no fault of his own, can't see past

           the end of his nose.

                          GINTY

           It's time to go home, ma.

          She reaches out her hand--

          INT. SUITE - EVENING

          Pamela looks through a stack of books intently, jotting

          something down on a piece Beverly Hills Hotel stationery

          every now and then.

          Presently, the phone rings. Pamela almost jumps out of her

          skin. She rushes to grab it.

                          PAMELA

                          (INTO PHONE)

           Mrs Travers! Hello!

          INT. DISNEY'S OFFICE - BURBANK - EVENING.

          Walt sits at his desk, flicking through cartoon drawings of

          penguins.

                          WALT

           (coughs into phone)

           Pam!

          INTERCUT BETWEEN PHONE CALLS AS NECESSARY.

                          PAMELA

                          (DISAPPOINTED)

           Mr Disney.

                          WALT

           Callin' to check up on you.

                          PAMELA

           Are you a doctor?

                          WALT

           Hm?

                          PAMELA

           Check ups are for medical

           practitioners no?

                          WALT

           Pam, are you always so battle

           ready? P.L. Travers in her breast

           plate and chain mail, sword up in

           the air and off with your head!

                          PAMELA

           What can I do for you Mister

           Disney?

                          WALT

           Please, I beg of you, please please

           call me Walt.

                          PAMELA

           Walt-- er.

                          WALT

           I heard things didn't go so well

           today.

                          PAMELA

           They went as well as they've gone

           every other day that I've been

           here. I don't recall `special'

           phone calls from you on any of

           those other evenings.

                          WALT

           What's this all about Pam? Really?

          Silence.

                          WALT (CONT'D)

           I'm wondering what I have to do to

           make you happy.

                          PAMELA

           Ha!

                          WALT

           Aren't you wondering that too?

          Silence.

                          WALT (CONT'D)

           (he has an idea)

           You know, you've never been to

           Disneyland! It's the happiest place

           on Earth!

           (shouting away from the

                          PHONE)

           Tommie! Cancel my morning tomorrow.

           I'm taking a ride with my favorite

           author!

                          (INTO PHONE)

           Any excuse.

                          PAMELA

           I cannot tell you how uninterested,

           no, positively sickened I am at the

           thought of going to see your dollar

           printing machine Mr-- Walter.

          She notices Mickey's innocent eyes staring at her and gently

          turns his face away.

                          WALT

           Oh come on! When does anybody get

           to go to Disneyland with Walt

           Disney himself?!

                          PAMELA

           Disappointments are to the soul

           what the thunderstorm is to the

           air.

          Walt slams the phone down. Pamela stares at it in shock!

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           Hello? Hello? He hung up! I'm! I! I

           can't believe he hung up!

          Walt leans back in his chair and grins, Tommie enters.

                          WALT

           I'm not a violent man Tommie but if

           Mrs P.L. Travers were to get hit by

           a large truck I--

                          TO FINISH)

          INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

          Dick, Bob and Don are drained. They stare at each other in

          silence. Just the look tells us how much this all means to

          them. It's desperate. Walt flings the door to the room open.

                          WALT

           Okay boys. We gotta fix this.

          INT. GOFF HOUSE - TRAVERS BEDROOM - ALLORA - MORNING

          Ginty sits beside her father, he is restless and sweating in

          his sleep as she wipes his face with a damp sponge.

          The sound of a buggy pulling up outside breaks the silence.

           MARGARET (O.S.)

           Oh my!

          And then a new voice, clear as a crystal bell.

           AUNT ELLIE (O.S.)

           Margaret, my poor child. I simply

           had to come. We must fix this.

          Travers eyes spring wide open in horror.

                          TRAVERS

           The Aunt.

          INT. GOFF HOUSE - ALLORA - MORNING

          A parrot headed umbrella hangs from the back of a chair.

          An enormous carpetbag - similar to the one Pamela carries -

          plonked on the living room table and there beside it,

          upright, imposing and matronly is AUNT ELLIE herself. Hair

          scraped back, hands neatly perched inside her apron pocket -

          a very different version but Mary Poppins all the same.

          Ginty looks on in awed silence as Ellie begins to remove an

          endless supply of belongings from her bag.

                          ELLIE

           Now, I've brought every new fangled

           treatment available in Sydney.

          Biddy is open mouthed.

                          ELLIE (CONT'D)

           Close your mouth please Biddy, we

           are not a codfish.

           (to both girls)

           I spy a multitude of jobs to be

           done!

                          MARGARET

           They've been so worried-- I've--

                          ELLIE

           Do stop babbling nonsense! I'm here

           now and I shall fix everything.

                          (BEAT)

           Girls!

                          (BEAT)

           Feverfew and camomile to lower his

           body temperature. Garlic, sorrel,

           sage. Deadly nightshade. And if

           those don't work-- well I shouldn't

           like to say.

          Young Pamela and Biddy look on in a kind of bewildered trance

          as item after item emerges from the carpetbag.

                          ELLIE (CONT'D)

           --tincture of horseradish--

                          LAUDANUM--

                          (MORE)

                          ELLIE (CONT'D)

           I thought I had made it quite clear

           you were to begin helping.

          Ellie claps her hands together.

                          ELLIE (CONT'D)

           Spit spot!

          INT. LIMOSINE - MORNING

          Ralph drives along solemnly. Pamela looks out of the window,

          confused.

                          PAMELA

           Where are we--? This isn't the way.

                          RALPH

           Change of venue this morning

           apparently.

                          PAMELA

           (realizing where she's

                          BEING TAKEN)

           Ugh.

                          RALPH

           I was thinking about our-- tea

           party?

                          PAMELA

           I'm sure I don't know what you're--

                          RALPH

                          (OVER)

           Yesterday, the little park.

                          PAMELA

           Little park? I haven't a clue what

           you're talking about.

                          RALPH

                          BUT--

                          PAMELA

           Concentrate on the road. Always

           chitter chattering!

          EXT. DISNEYLAND ENTRANCE - DAY

          Ralph drives Pamela up to the entrance to the park. Two

          security guards stop the car briefly and then the gates pull

          open to reveal Walt Disney waiting for Pamela.

          INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

          Ralph is goggle-eyed at seeing Walt.

                          RALPH

           Oh! Isn't that nice? Holy mackerel!

           Wowzers. Never met him myself but

           there he is! Right there. Real.

           Living, breathing. Oh boy!

          EXT. DISNEYLAND - DAY

          Ralph jump out of the car to let his passenger out but Disney

          is there first.

                          WALT

           Welcome to the Magic Kingdom!

          Pamela steps out of the car and her eyes nearly pop out of

          her head with brightness of the place, unbelievable colour

          and excitement.

                          PAMELA

           Is it all like this?

          Pamela pops a headache pill.

                          WALT

           Yup! Isn't it wonderful?

          Ralph hovers at the car, filling his eyeballs with as much

          Walt Disney as he can get before he has to drive away.

                          PAMELA

           Do you always get everything you

           want Walter?

                          WALT

           Pretty much!

                          PAMELA

           With the exception to the rights to

           my books of course!

                          WALT

           War ain't over yet Pam!

          Walt takes Pamela by the arm and leads her through the gates

          and a murmur goes through the crowds as they gawp. A YOUNG

          WOMAN breaks free and rushes up to Walt.

                          YOUNG WOMAN

           I love you so much! Can I--?

          She proffers a pen and paper but Walt is prepared, he takes a

          signed postcard with his face on it from his top pocket and

          hands it to the woman.

                          PAMELA

                          (DISGUSTED)

           Pre-signed?

                          WALT

                          (TO WOMAN)

           You should get hers too.

           (gesturing to Pamela)

           This woman's a bona fide genius!

          The woman looks expectantly at Pamela who just snorts. she

          realizes she's getting nothing and, clutching her precious

          postcard to her chest, melts back into the crowd who part

          like the red sea for Walt and his guest.

          EXT. MAIN STREET - DISNEYLAND - CONTINUOUS

          Walt and Pamela make their way down Main Street. Walt stops

          anyone from getting too close by immediately handing out

          postcards to anyone who gets near.

                          WALT

           In Adventureland there is a tree--

           this is a fun fact. A titbit.

                          PAMELA

           Tidbit.

                          WALT

                          (OVER)

           It has three million leaves, four

           million flowers.

                          PAMELA

           Gosh.

                          WALT

           And they said only God could make a

           tree!

          Pamela rolls her eyes.

          There is a protracted silence as they walk, both encompassed

          by their own thoughts. The sunshine, the joyful crowds just

          background colour.

          They pass by a store front and Walt glances up at the window.

          It reads: Elias Disney Contractor Est. 1895. Pamela notices

          the look but doesn't say anything.

                          WALT (CONT'D)

           Where did she come from?

                          PAMELA

           Who?

                          WALT

           I think you know who.

                          PAMELA

           She flew in through the window one

           day.

                          WALT

           Through the window huh?

          Pamela nods curtly.

                          WALT (CONT'D)

           It's just that easy isn't it Mrs

           Travers?

          He sees right through her.

                          WALT (CONT'D)

           I know you don't wanna be here so

           I'm gonna take you to one ride-- my

           favourite amusement and then I'll

           set you free.

          Way ahead of them the carousel spins in the distance.

          EXT. KING ARTHUR'S CAROUSEL - DISNEYLAND - DAY

          The carousel slows to a halt and a herd of excited children

          climb down from the horses and disappear into the park.

                          WALT

           Mrs Travers, I would be honoured if

           you would ride Jingles. She's Mrs

           Disney's favourite horse.

          He escorts Pamela to a beautiful white horse, roses on it's

          bridal.

                          PAMELA

           No thank you. I'm happy to watch.

                          WALT

           No greater joy than that seen

           through the eyes of a child.

          Pamela looks at the children climbing onto the carousel.

                          WALT (CONT'D)

           There's a child in us all.

                          PAMELA

           Maybe in you Mister Disney, but

           certainly not I.

                          WALT

           Get on the horse Pamela!

          Pamela sighs and allows Walt to help her onto the horse.

                          WALT (CONT'D)

           When we first met, you said to me

           `they're family.'

                          PAMELA

           I said what?

                          WALT

           Mary Poppins, the Banks's, they're

           family.

                          (BEAT)

           The boys have had an idea for your

           Mister Banks. I think it'll make

           you happy.

                          PAMELA

           You brought me all the way out here

           to tell me that?

                          WALT

           No. I brought you all the way out

           here for monetary gain. Had a wager

           with the boys that I couldn't get

           you on a ride. I win!

          He clambers onto his own horse, gestures to the ride

          controller and off they go!

          Pamela gently bobs up and down, Walt waves to her and she

          sees the unbridled thrill from the child in Mister Disney

          spilling out. The tiniest, tiniest of smiles threatens to

          surface on her lips as he points a finger in the air as if

          shooting for the stars.

                          WALT (CONT'D)

           Yah!

          INT. TRAVER'S BEDROOM - ALLORA - DAY

          Travers has a violent coughing fit, he looks to his hand,

          disturbed to see blood there. He grimaces at Ellie who has

          her back to him as she folds clothes, a look of deep

          satisfaction on her face.

                          ELLIE

           Well begun, is half done!

          His face softens as his hazy gaze falls upon Ginty, outside

          the window, sweeping. Their eyes meet for a brief moment, an

          unspoken understanding of what is to come, before his close

          with tiredness.

          INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

          All the tables have been pushed to the walls, Don is just

          pushing the last one away as Pamela comes in, followed by

          Dolly with the tray carrying Pamela's tea.

                          DON

           Good morning Mrs Travers!

          She looks at the new arrangement of the room.

                          PAMELA

           What horrors have you in store for

           my beautiful characters today, hm?

          Bob clenches a fist but Dick gives him a look that says: keep

          calm.

                          DON

           Now, Mrs Travers you sit here.

          He ushers her to a chair facing the centre of the room. He

          hands pages to Bob and pages to Dolly. Don and Dolly drop to

          their knees so that they are half the height of Bob.

          Pamela raises an eyebrow.

                          DON (CONT'D)

           We thought about what you said Mrs

           Travers and Mr Banks isn't cruel.

           He isn't. We've got a new ending

           for the film. Oh god, I hope you

           like it.

          Bob pulls a kite out from behind his back.

                          DON (CONT'D)

                          (AS MICHAEL)

           Michael says, "He mended it! It's

           wonderful!"

                          DOLLY

                          (AS JANE)

           However did you manage it?

                          PAMELA

                          (TO HERSELF)

           He mended it?

          Dick strikes a chord on the piano.

                          DICK

                          (SINGING)

           With tuppence for paper and strings

           You can have your own set of wings

           With your feet on the ground

           You're a bird in flight

           with your fist holding tight

           To the string of your kite

           Oh oh oh oh

          Bob takes the hands of Don and Dolly and he dances around

          with them (awkwardly as they are still on their knees and Bob

          has a limp.) Pamela's eyes on the fixed kite.

                          DICK & BOB

           Let's go fly a kite

           Up to the highest height

           Let's go fly a kite and send it

                          SOARING

           Up through the atmosphere

           Up where the air is clear

           Oh let's go fly a kite

          Don notices Pamela's foot tapping, he stands up.

                          DON

           And then Mrs Banks goes to fetch

           her suffragettes ribbon.

                          DOLLY

           (as Mrs Banks)

           "A proper kite needs a proper tail

           don't you think?!"

          Don drops to his knees again.

           BOB/DICK/DON/DOLLY

           Let's go fly a kite

           Up to the highest height

          Is Pamela humming too?!

           BOB/DICK/DON/DOLLY (CONT'D)

           Let's go fly a kite and send it

                          SOARING

          Don bows to Pamela puts his hand out to her and to his

          surprise, she accepts and they begin to waltz. Pamela is

          surprisingly elegant and accomplished.

           BOB/DICK/DON/DOLLY/PAMELA

           Up through the atmosphere

           Up where the air is clear

           Oh let's go fly a kite

          Everybody is up and dancing, it's like something out of a

          Disney movie!

                          DICK

           When you send it flying up there

           All at once you're lighter than air

          Dolly breaks away and rushes from the room.

                          DICK (CONT'D)

           You can dance on the breeze over

           houses and trees--

          INT. DISNEY OUTER OFFICE - DAY

          Dolly pants her way to the top of the stairs, and sees Walt

          just about to enter his office.

                          DOLLY

           Mr Disney! Walt!

          Walt spins around.

                          DOLLY (CONT'D)

           I'm sorry to interrupt. It's just

           she-- she's dancing! Mrs Travers.

           She's dancing with Don!

          He cracks a great big smile.

           DICK (V.O.)

           With your fist holding tight

           To the string of your kite

          INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

          As before.

           BOB/DICK/DON/PAMELA

           Oh Oh Oh Oh

           Let's go fly a kite

           Up to the highest height

           Let's go fly a kite and send it

                          SOARING

           Up through the atmosphere

           Up where the air is clear

           Oh let's go fly a kite!

          They all collapse in a heap, exhausted and thrilled.

                          PAMELA

           Well.

                          BOB

           Well?

                          PAMELA

           Yes! He fixes the kite! Oh, I love

           it!

          Dick punches the air.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           Though proper English would be `Let

           us go and fly a kite.'

          Bob glares at her.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           But I might be willing to overlook

           that.

                          BOB

           Did we get that on tape?

          Everybody sighs with relief and Pamela looks to the

          caricature of Mr Banks with deep warmth.

          INT. TRAVERS BEDROOM - GOFF HOUSE - EVENING

          Ginty sits with her father, he's a shadow of his former self,

          extremely ill. The shaking has stopped, his lips are parched

          and blueish.

                          TRAVERS

           Look at you-- all ship shape.

          Travers reaches up a shaking hand and musses up Ginty's

          perfectly plaited hair.

                          GINTY

           I re-wrote the poem father.

          Travers doesn't respond. Ginty reaches into her pocket, takes

          out tuppence.

                          GINTY (CONT'D)

           The aunt gave me tuppence.

          She shows it to him in her open palm.

                          GINTY (CONT'D)

           Shall I buy you something father?

          Ginty skips off the porch, clutching her tuppence. Chattering

          to herself about pears.

          The limo crests the top of the hill.

          Ralph admires the view as he always does.

                          PAMELA

           Do you know you're quite right? It

           is beautiful. Exquisite.

                          RALPH

           It's always new.

          INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

          Pamela leans on the piano peering at her script. The boys are

          dotted about the room; all are mid-work.

                          (TO PAMELA)

           So Jolly Holiday's in?

                          PAMELA

           As you wish.

          Pamela is genuinely curious.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           Now, how in the world does Mister

           Disney propose to train penguins to

           dance?!

                          BOB

           Are you serious?

                          PAMELA

           I've heard about his implausibly

           leaved trees so I assume he does

           have some insane penguin wrangling

           scheme but it does seem rather far

           fetched. Can you train penguins?

                          DON

                          (LAUGHING)

           No I don't think you can train an

                          (OVER)

           They're animated.

          Pamela is confounded.

                          PAMELA

           Sorry?

                          DON

           Dick.

                          DICK

           Cartoons.

          He draws a little squiggle in the air to illustrate his

          point.

                          DON

           Dick.

          Pamela's face turns beetroot red, she pushes herself away

          from the table and storms out of the room, slamming the door

          behind her.

                          DON (CONT'D)

           Crap.

           I would not like to take a seat

           thank you. I would like to--

          She heads for Disney's office and Dolly is up and running

          after her down the corridor.

                          DOLLY

           Mrs Travers, please!

          Pamela pushes open Walt's doors, catching him in the midst of

          signing a stack of postcards of his grinning face, an unlit

          cigarette in his pen hand.

                          TOMMIE

           the door.

          Disney gestures to his cigarette.

                          WALT (CONT'D)

           Never let anybody see me smoking.

           I'd hate to encourage bad habits.

           Penguins have very much upset me

           Mister Disney! Animated, dancing

           penguins! Now, you have seduced me

           with the music Mr Disney, yes you

           have. Those Sherman boys have quite

           turned my head but I shall not be

           moved on the matter of cartoons.

           It's a sequence--

                          UNDERSTAND--

                          PAMELA

           The books weren't written for the

           children. They were written for the

           promise breakers.

                          WALT

           The promise breakers? Mrs Travers I-

                          -

          But she's gone, face to the sky, eyes closed, breathing.

                          WALT (CONT'D)

           Mrs Travers?

          Ralph pulls up and gets out of the car.

                          RALPH

           Woah! Mister Disney!

                          WALT

           Hi.

                          RALPH

           Hi! I'm such a huge fan. It's such

           an honour to--

          He suddenly sees that Pamela is more deeply entrenched in

          herself than usual and his priority becomes her.

                          RALPH (CONT'D)

                          (TO WALT)

           Excuse me.

          Ralph moves past Walt and gently taps Pamela on the shoulder,

          she opens her eyes, relieved to see him.

                          RALPH (CONT'D)

           You ready to go Mrs?

                          PAMELA

           Yes. Thank you.

                          WALT

                          PAMELA--

                          PAMELA

                          (TEARING UP)

           I'm so sorry Mister Disney. To have

           put everyone to so much trouble.

                          WALT

           You must reconsider. You must.

                          PAMELA

           I simply can't give her up. Not

           yet. Perhaps not ever. I don't know

                          WHY

                          DISNEY

           You do know why!

                          PAMELA

           I can't, he's--

                          DISNEY

           He's?

                          PAMELA

           I just-- Goodbye Mr Disney.

          She goes to get in the car and Disney puts a hand to stop her

          but Ralph blocks it.

                          RALPH

           The lady's ready to go now sir.

          Walt steps away and Ralph closes the door to the car.

                          WALT

           He's?

          Walt watches the car disappear, wracked with frustration and

          confusion. He takes a seat on Pamela's bench and wraps his

          arms around himself and looks to the sky.

          EXT. LAX - DAY

          Ralph climbs out of the limo and opens the back door for

          Pamela. He gestures for a valet to come and take her bags and

          opens the trunk of the car.

                          RALPH

           It's been a pleasure driving you

           Mrs.

                          PAMELA

           No one likes a fibber.

                          RALPH

                          (CHUCKLES)

           I really have enjoyed it. Didn't

           know who you were at first and then

           guess what?

                          PAMELA

           You found out?

                          RALPH

           I was telling my daughter all about

           my day and how I was driving this

           nice writer lady, Mrs Travers for

           Mr Disney and--

                          PAMELA

                          AND--

                          RALPH

                          AND--

           (he leans into the

                          PASSENGER WINDOW)

           And she makes me go to her bedroom

           and get this!

           (he pulls out a Mary

                          POPPINS BOOK)

           Can't stop reading it. I'm very

           slow mind you.

          Pamela smiles.

                          PAMELA

           Would you like me to sign it?

                          RALPH

                          (DELIGHTED)

           Would you?!

                          PAMELA

           I'd be honoured.

          Ralph hands her his pen and she begins to write.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           Your daughters name?

                          RALPH

           Jane.

                          PAMELA

           Really?

                          RALPH

           Uh huh. Like the girl in the book.

                          PAMELA

           (reading as she writes)

           To Jane and her dearest father--

           (she looks at him)

           I've just this instant realized I

           don't know your name.

                          RALPH

           Ralph.

          She shakes his hand.

                          PAMELA

           Pamela.

                          RALPH

           Pamela.

                          PAMELA

           You're the only American I have

           ever liked, Ralph.

          Ralph is chuffed to bits.

                          RALPH

           May I ask why?

                          PAMELA

           No. Now take this--

          She hands him the piece of Beverly Hills Hotel stationery

          with her notes on.

                          RALPH

                          (READING)

           Albert Einstein, Van Gogh,

           Roosevelt, Frida Kahlo--

                          (BEAT)

           What is this?

                          PAMELA

           They all had difficulties. Jane can

           do anything that anyone else can

           do, do you understand?

          Ralph looks at her in awe.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           Look at the bottom.

                          RALPH

           Walt Disney!

                          PAMELA

           Deficiencies in concentration and

           hyperactive behavior. Explains

           everything!

          Pamela turns to leave.

                          RALPH

           Thank you Mrs.

          Pamela doesn't look back.

          INT. DISNEY - OUTER OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

          Tommie and Dolly silence their gossiping as a tired and

          broken Walt Disney appears in front of them.

                          WALT

           She's gone?

          Tommie looks down at her paperwork and nods at Walt

          apologetically.

                          TOMMIE

           Flight left 10 minutes ago.

          Tommie hands him the itinerary, he glares at it.

                          WALT

                          NAME)

           Goff? Who's Helen Goff?

                          TOMMIE

           Her. That's her real name.

          Walt is confused.

                          DOLLY

           Yuh, didn't you know? She's all

           hoity toity. British this and

           British that and she's really an

           Aussie called Helen Goff. Stuck up--

                          WALT

           Then who's Travers?

          Tommie and Dolly look at each other and shrug.

                          WALT (CONT'D)

           (smiles to himself)

           I've been talking to the wrong

           person.

          EXT. GOFF HOUSE - DAY

          Ginty skips up the path, clutching a brown paper bag. She

          ruffles Andrew's fur before entering the house.

          INT. GOFF HOUSE - DAY

          Ginty senses something wrong, she hears hushed, urgent and

          emotional voices in the hall. She pokes her head into the

          hallway. There, huddled together, whispering are her mother,

          the doctor and Aunt Ellie.

          Ellie is holding a pile of blood stained sheets.

          Ginty stands frozen, trying to still the panicked beating of

          her heart.

          Margaret spies Ginty and moves towards her as if in slo-mo.

          There are flecks of blood on her dress. She is ashen,

          shattered. She comes down to Ginty's level.

                          MARGARET

                          DADDY--

          Ginty cannot react.

          Margaret sweeps her into her arms and Ginty drops the brown

          paper bag; it tears and scatters pears all over the floor.

          Ginty's eyes fix on Aunt Ellie's umbrella on the back of the

          chair, drawn into its beady black eyes.

                          GINTY

           I want to see my father.

                          MARGARET

           No, you mustn't.

                          GINTY

           I want to see him!

          Suddenly she turns into a wildcat - lashing, thrashing,

          biting, screaming. Nothing will stop her seeing Travers.

                          AUNT ELLIE

           Let her go Margaret.

          Margaret is forced to let go and Ginty runs for her father's

          bedroom.

          INT. TRAVERS' BEDROOM - DAY

          Ginty stands in the bedroom, a long way from the bed. She

          stands there, it seems, for an eternity. Then, finally, step

          by step she draws closer. The empty bottle on the floor. The

          sheets twisted, still wet with sweat, flecked and spotted

          with blood. The front of her father's nightdress is also

          bloodstained. Ginty's eyes reach his face. Travers lies, eyes

          open, mouth open, teeth slightly red-stained, neither

          peaceful nor distressed. Just-- nothing.

                          GINTY

           I dropped the pears.

          She perches on the edge of the bed and takes his hand.

                          GINTY (CONT'D)

           I'm sorry daddy.

          Ellie appears in the doorway, Ginty addresses her without

          turning around.

                          GINTY (CONT'D)

           You promised you would fix

           everything.

          EXT. SHAWFIELD STREET - LONDON - DAY

          A black London Taxi pulls up outside the house. Pamela climbs

          out of the car, struggling to pull her huge Mickey Mouse out

          too.

          INT. SHAWFIELD STREET - LONDON - DAY

          Pamela moves through the vestibule, lugging her suitcase.

                          PAMELA

           Hello house.

          INT. PAMELA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Pamela sits in a chair in the living room watching in

          darkness. She gently closes her eyes, ringed with sadness and

          a lifetime's despair.

          There's a knock at the door and she jolts awake, she doesn't

          know how long she's been asleep but it's black outside. She

          gets up and rushes to the door as quickly as her feet will

          take her.

          She swings it open.

                          PAMELA

           Oh dear god!

          Standing on the doorstep is Walt Disney. Pamela is, quite

          literally, speechless.

                          WALT

           It was one heck of a job getting a

           seat on the very next flight, let

           me tell you.

                          PAMELA

           But, you always get what you want

           eventually. Isn't that right

           Walter?

          He looks down at her hand clenched into a fist and shaking.

                          WALT

           How about you show me how to make

           one of those nice English pots of

           tea?

          INT. PAMELA'S DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT

          Pamela sits at the table, as Disney carries in a tray with a

          teapot, a milk jug, a sugar bowl and two cups. These he

          places on the table and proceeds to pour tea.

                          PAMELA

           Milk. The milk goes in first.

          He attends to it.

                          WALT

           I remember.

                          PAMELA

           And whiskey. I'll have whiskey in

           mine.

          Disney follows her gesture to the whiskey decanter. She takes

          it from him and pours a generous slug into her teacup.

                          WALT

                          (SURPRISED)

           Oh.

                          (BEAT)

           Oh well, when in Rome!

          He pours a slug into his tea too.

                          PAMELA

           You've come to change my mind. To

           beat me into submission.

                          WALT

           No, I've come because you misjudge

           me.

                          PAMELA

           How do I misjudge you?

                          WALT

           You look at me and you see some

           kind of Hollywood King Midas.

                          (MORE)

                          WALT (CONT'D)

           You think I've built an empire and

           that I want to use your Mary

           Poppins as just another brick in my

           kingdom. You think I see her with a

           carpetbag full of greenbacks.

                          PAMELA

           And don't you?

                          WALT

           If that was all it was would I have

           pursued an cranky, stubborn dame

           like you for twenty years? I'd've

           have saved myself an ulcer!

                          (BEAT)

           No, you expected me to disappoint

           you and so you made sure I did. You

           see, I think life disappoints you,

           Mrs Travers. I think it's done

           that a lot. Maybe Mary Poppins is

           the only person in your life who

           hasn't.

                          PAMELA

           Mary Poppins isn't real.

                          WALT

           Oh, no, that's not true. She's real

           as can be to my daughter's and to

           thousands of other children--

           adults too. She's been there as a

           nighttime comfort to a heck of a

           lot of people.

                          PAMELA

           Well, Where is she when I need her?

           Hm? I open the door to Mary Poppins

           and who should be standing there

           but Walt Disney!

          He laughs.

                          WALT

           Mrs Travers, I am so sorry. I hoped

           this would be a magical experience

           for you, for all of us. But I let

           you down-- and in doing so, I've

           broken a twenty year old promise to

           my girls.

                          (BEAT)

           I've been wracking my brains,

           trying to figure out why this has

           been so hard for you and I--

                          (BEAT)

           You see, I have my own Mr Banks.

           Mine had a moustache.

                          PAMELA

           Ah! Not true then that Disney

           created man in his own image?

                          WALT

           But it is true that you created

           yourself in someone else's yes?

          She doesn't answer. Walt takes mouthful of laced tea and

          coughs a little.

                          WALT (CONT'D)

           Ever been to Kansas City, Mrs

           Travers? Do you know Missouri at

           all?

                          PAMELA

           Can't say I do and as I have no

           plans to ever set foot on American

           soil again I'm afraid I never will.

                          WALT

           It's mighty cold there in the

           winters. Bitter.

          Walt stops talking, catches himself, looks away and then

          gives in. His enthusiasm completely disappears and he's

          suddenly as ragged and as weary as Pamela.

                          WALT (CONT'D)

           (it pours out)

           My dad, Elias Disney, he owned a

           newspaper delivery route there.

           Thousand papers. Twice daily.

           Morning and evening edition. Elias,

           he was a tough businessman. A save-

           a-penny anywhere you can type of

           fella so he wouldn't employ any

           delivery boys, he just used me and

           my big brother Roy. I was eight

           then-- eight years old.

                          (BEAT)

           Like I said, those winters were

           harsh and old Elias didn't believe

           in new shoes until the old ones

           were worn right through so--

                          (BEAT)

           Honestly, Mrs Travers, the snow

           would be up to here--

          He gestures to his knees.

                          WALT (CONT'D)

           You'd push through it like wading

           through molasses.

                          (MORE)

                          WALT (CONT'D)

           And the cold and the wet would be

           seeping through the shoes and the

           skin would be raw and peeling from

           our faces-- and sometimes I'd find

           myself sunk down in the snow,

           waking up, cuz I must've passed out

           for a moment-- I dunno. Then

           school, too cold to figure out an

           equation. And back into the snow so

           by the time we got home it'd be

           just getting dark, and every part

           of you would sting like crazy as it

           slowly came back to life in the

           warmth. My mother would feed us

           dinner and then it'd be time to go

           out again for the evening edition.

                          (BEAT)

           Best be quick Walt, best be quick

           or poppa's gonna show you the

           buckle end again boy.

          Walt smiles at Pamela, sips his tea.

                          WALT (CONT'D)

           Now, I don't tell you all this to

           make you sad Mrs Travers, I don't.

           I love my life - it's a miracle.

           And I loved my daddy, boy I loved

           him. But, there isn't a day goes by

           where I don't think of that little

           boy in the snow and old Elias with

           his fist and strap and I'm just so

           tired-- I'm tired of remembering it

           that way. Aren't you tired Mrs

           Travers? We all have our tales but

           don't you want to find a way to

           finish the story? Let it all go and

           have a life that isn't dictated by

           a past?

                          (BEAT)

           It's not the children she comes to

           save. It's their father.

                          (BEAT)

           It's your father--?

                          (BEAT)

           Travers Goff.

                          PAMELA

           I don't know what you think you

           know about me Walter--

                          WALT

           You must've loved and admired him a

           lot to take his name--

                          PAMELA

                          I--

                          WALT

           Mrs. Travers. It's all about him

           isn't it? All of this. Everything.

          Pamela looks at her hands, they're shaking.

                          WALT (CONT'D)

           Forgiveness. It's what I learned

           from your books.

                          PAMELA

           I don't need to forgive my father.

           He was a wonderful man.

                          WALT

           No, you need to forgive Helen Goff.

           Life is a harsh sentence to lay

           down for yourself.

          Pamela looks down at the table top.

                          WALT (CONT'D)

           Give her to me, Mrs Travers. Trust

           me with your precious Mary Poppins.

           I won't disappoint you. I swear

           that every time a person goes into

           a movie house - from Leicester to

           St Louis, they will see George

           Banks being saved. They will love

           him and his kids, they will weep

           for his cares, and wring their

           hands when he loses his job. And

           when he flies that kite, oh! They

           will rejoice, they will sing. In

           every movie house, all over the

           world, in the eyes and the hearts

           of my kids, and other kids and

           their mothers and fathers for

           generations to come, George Banks

           will be honoured. George Banks will

           be redeemed. George Banks and all

           he stands for will be saved.

           Maybe not in life, but in

           imagination. Because that's what we

           storytellers do. We restore order

           with imagination. We instill hope

           again and again and again. Trust

           me, Mrs Travers. Let me prove it to

           you. I give you my word.

          INT. PAMELA'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Pamela is alone. The unsigned rights papers in front of her

          on the table. She looks at Mickey who occupies the chair

          opposite her, her face softens under his gaze.

                          PAMELA

           Enough.

          EXT. ANIMATION BUILDING - THREE YEARS LATER - DAY

          Disney employees pass by a giant movie poster which reads:

          MARY POPPINS - OPENING SOON! Walt exits the building. He's

          but a few steps out of the door when Tommie appears behind

          him.

                          TOMMIE

           Walt.

          She hands him a sheet of paper.

                          TOMMIE (CONT'D)

           Invitation list for the premiere.

                          WALT

           Is that everyone?

                          TOMMIE

           Not everyone.

          She looks at Walt questioningly.

                          WALT

                          (SIGHS)

           We'll premiere in London as well.

           It'll be more convenient for her.

          Tommie holds his look.

                          WALT (CONT'D)

           There'll be cameras, press,

           interviews-- I have to protect the

           picture.

                          TOMMIE

           Okay.

          Walt walks away, he's lost a bit of steam. Tommy watches him

          go.

                         OMITTED

          INT. PAMELA'S OFFICE - DAY.

          Pamela taps away on her typewriter with gusto. She pings the

          return and breathes, satisfied.

                          PAMELA

           I should say so too.

          The doorbell sounds, voices.

          Pamela begins to tap again.

           POLLY (O.S.)

           Mrs Travers!

          Pamela tuts, tries to carry on with her work.

           POLLY (O.S.) (CONT'D)

           Mrs Travers!

          Pamela rises from her chair, smoothes down her skirt.

                          PAMELA

           For goodness sake!

          She rises from her chair, smoothes down her skirt and makes

          her way to the front door.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           Please don't screech like an

           alleycat!

          INT. PAMELA'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Pamela and Diarmuid sit together. Pamela is quite changed,

          she looks younger, radiant, worry free.

                          DIARMUID

           I am so pleased to hear that Mrs

           Travers.

                          PAMELA

           I should think you'll have a draft

           very soon.

                          (CALLING OUT)

           Polly! Where's that tea?

                          (TO DIARMUID)

           It's coming along marvelously!

          Polly kicks the door open with her foot and plonks the tea

          down in front of Pamela and Diarmuid. She sneezes twice,

          doesn't bother to pour and turns to leave.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

                          (TO POLLY)

           Would you pour please?

                          POLLY

           You're perfectly capable of doing

           it yourself.

          Polly leaves, Pamela rolls her eyes.

                          PAMELA

           She's quite the worst maid I've

           ever had!

                          DIARMUID

           So why do you keep her?

                          PAMELA

           I don't know-- she reminds me of

           me.

          Diarmuid laughs.

                          DIARMUID

           Do you have a title?

                          PAMELA

           Mary Poppins in the Kitchen.

                          DIARMUID

           Wonderful. Should we start talking

           about the film rights?

          Pamela narrows her eyes at him.

                          PAMELA

           NEVER again.

                          DIARMUID

           Okay.

                          (BEAT)

           Now, tell me, Have you got your

           tiara for the premiere?

                          PAMELA

           Oh, I'm not going.

                          DIARMUID

           Why not?

                          PAMELA

           Hollywood premieres are not for old

           trout like me. Anyway, it's not

                          CONVENIENT--

                          DIARMUID

           He hasn't invited you, has he?

          Pamela doesn't reply.

                          DIARMUID (CONT'D)

           Mary Poppins wouldn't stand for

           that.

          INT. PLANE - DAY

          Pamela is hot and bothered trying to wrestle her cabin

          baggage into an overhead locker. The same flight attendant

          from the top of the film appears.

                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT

           Can I help you?

                          PAMELA

           I'm perfectly capable thank you.

          The flight attendant recognizes her with something akin to

          horror.

                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT

           Suit yourself-- ma'am.

                          PAMELA

                          (CHEERY)

           I shall!

           CAPTAIN (O.S.)

           Ladies and gentlemen, good

           afternoon and welcome aboard this

           flight to Los Angeles. Just a few

           announcements before we begin our

           taxi for takeoff--

          Pamela takes the seat next to the window, she looks out at

          the tarmac.

          She closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, opens her eyes

          again and tucks her feet tidily together. She folds her hands

          neatly into her lap and looks straight ahead.

          INT. DISNEY STUDIOS - OUTER OFFICE - DAY

          Walt enters the outer office walking briskly towards his own

          office.

                          WALT

           Morning Dolly.

          Dolly opens her mouth to speak but he's already past and

                         APPROACHING--

                         TOMMIE'S DESK

          Tommie sits, arms crossed and stares, half bemused at Walt.

                          WALT (CONT'D)

           What?

          Tommie nods toward his office. Pamela is sitting in a chair,

          back to them.

                          PAMELA

           Me again!

          INT. DISNEY OFFICE - DAY

          Walt semi-recovers as quickly as possible and enters his

          office.

                          WALT

           Mrs Travers! How wonderful to see

           you. What brings you to--

                          PAMELA

           I'm here for my premiere.

                          WALT

           Great!

                          PAMELA

           I didn't receive my invitation, but

           I just assumed the American postal

           service had fallen down on the job

           as per usual.

          She smiles sweetly.

                          WALT

           I'll have a-- uh, replacement sent

           to your hotel right away.

                          PAMELA

           That's very kind, Mr Disney. I knew

           you wouldn't have forgotten me.

                          WALT

           Pam, how could I?

                          PAMELA

           How indeed? You did, after all,

           assure me that I wouldn't be

           disappointed.

          INT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAY

          The porter lets Pamela into her room, and doesn't even bother

          hovering for a tip.

          Pamela turns and it's like deju vu - the flowers, the

          chocolates, the champagne, a VIP invitation to the premiere

          of Walt Disney's Mary Poppins. And, of course, the ubiquitous

          stuffed Mickey Mouse.

                          PAMELA

                          (TO MICKEY)

           I thought I left you in London.

          EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - FORECOURT - NIGHT

          Pamela looks wonderful in a long white gown with turquoise

          silk gloves to her elbows and matching wrap falling from her

          shoulders.

                          PAMELA

                          (TO DOORMAN)

           Would you call me a taxi please?

                          DOORMAN

           Absolutely.

          The doorman goes to find her a cab and in his absence a limo

          pulls up to the kerb. Pamela doesn't dare get her hopes up

          but the door swings open and there he is, her favorite person

          in America.

                          RALPH

           Had a feeling a certain friend of

           mine might be needing me tonight.

                          PAMELA

           Ralph!

          She rushes to him and they give each other a friendly hug.

                          RALPH

           You look like a million bucks!

           Let's get you to the ball.

          He opens the back door for her and she climbs in.

          EXT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATER - HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT

          It's spectacular! Disney's biggest Hollywood opening. Bulbs

          flash continuously as limo after limo pulls up at the red

          carpet. Ushers are dressed as English bobbies. Reporters

          stand on podiums in colourful suits, Penguins dance their

          hearts out in front of the theater. Pearly Kings and Queens

          play for the onlookers. Crowds and crowds of fans scream

          every time a bulb flashes, waving their autograph books and

          posters in the air. Every Disney character imaginable bounces

          up and down the lines of well-wishers, hugging them, dancing

          for them, signing their booklets. Hollywood Blvd is

          completely shut down and the atmosphere is like the happiest

          party you could ever go to.

          INT. LIMO - NIGHT

          Ralph takes the car slowly through the crowds. Onlookers

          press their faces against the windows trying to make out who

          is inside. Pamela is nervous, everyone else has someone with

          them but Pamela must brave the crowd alone.

          EXT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATER - HOLLYWOOD -NIGHT

          The limo stops at the edge of the carpet and Ralph jumps out.

          He rushes round to Pamela's side and helps her from the car.

          Immediately a round of flashes go off and Pamela puts her arm

          up to shield her eyes. It's too much.

                          RALPH

           (in her ear)

           This is your night. None of this

           would be possible without you.

          She brings her arm down, straightens her dress and breaks

          into a smile, making her way down the carpet to frantic

          whispers amongst the press and autograph hunters of: "Who is

          that?" "Is that anyone?" Pamela spots Walt, Dick Van Dyke and

          Julie Andrews being interviewed together up ahead.

          Mickey Mouse bounces down the carpet and slows-- he and

          Pamela lock eyes for a brief moment. He holds out his gloved

          hand, she takes it and together they watch as a huge toy

          train chugs to a halt on the blvd and hundreds upon hundreds

          of coloured balloons fly out of it's roof and into the air.

          EXT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATRE - NIGHT

          Pamela moves through the spangling, glittering, perfect

          toothed Hollywood crowd and no-one pays any attention to her.

          INT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATRE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

          The auditorium is jam packed. Pamela is seated in front of

          Walt Disney. Don, the Shermans and their families are in the

          same row as her - Bob Sherman next to her. The lights begin

          to dim. The overture begins--

          We stay close on Pamela as the sounds of the overture fade

          and the melody of a single tin whistle playing one of Travers

          old melody's rings in her ears.

          We hear snippets of the film in the background but we remain

          with Pamela.

          She looks around at the faces in the audience - laughing,

          humming, sad, happy, joyous.

          Intercut with images from Pamela's childhood and the voices

          of Bert and Jane -

          Ellie's parrot head umbrella--

                          BERT

           You know, begging your pardon, but

           the one my heart goes out to is

           your father.

          The carousel horses at the Allora fair--

                          BERT (CONT'D)

           There he is in that cold, heartless

           bank day after day, hemmed in by

           mounds of cold, heartless

           money.

          The tuppence and rolling pears--

                          BERT (CONT'D)

           I don't like to see any living

           thing caged up.

          Uncle Albert with Ginty on his back, carrying her river

          soaked mother back to the house--

                          JANE

           Father in a cage?

          Ginty pressing the final bottle into her father's hand--

                          BERT

           They makes cages in all sizes and

           shapes, you know.

          The image of the dead Travers in his bloodstained bed--

                          BERT (CONT'D)

           Bank-shaped some of 'em, carpets

           and all.

                          DISSOLVE TO:

          Children in the audience, their little faces tilted upwards.

          Rapt.

                          MICHEAL

           You won't ever leave us will you?

                          JANE

           Whatever would we do without you?

                          MARY POPPINS

           I shall stay until the wind

           changes.

          And then an image from the film:

          George Banks walks away from us down the misty tree-lined

          London street, on his way to be fired from the bank.

          Walt Disney watches with quiet satisfaction.

          Pamela however has tears coursing down her face. Her

          shoulders heave as she tries desperately not to sob out loud

          but people are noticing, looking at her.

          Disney leans forward, placing a hand on her shoulder. She

          reaches up and grips it tightly, unable to speak.

                          WALT

           It's all right, Mrs Travers. It's

           alright. Mr Banks is going to be

           all right. I promise.

          Pamela nods in gratitude, but cannot contain her sobs. It's

          all pouring from her now, in one immense catharsis.

                          PAMELA

           No, no. It's just that-- I can't, I

           can't abide cartoons!

          We stay on her face as we bring up the final song of the

          film: Let's Go Fly A Kite. The audience around her are

          smiling, laughing, singing along. Pamela, the tears, silent

          now, still pouring down her cheeks as she slowly begins to

          mouth along with the lyrics.

          And in her head one final image appears.

          Travers gaze falls upon Ginty, outside his bedroom window,

          sweeping. Their eyes meet for a brief moment, an unspoken

          understanding of what is to come, before his close with

          tiredness.

           TRAVERS (V.O.)

           Never. I promise. I will never lose

           you.

                          DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. MARYBOROUGH PARK - DAY

          The shadow of an umbrella leaves the ten-year-old Ginty

          sitting in the lush grass, arms wrapped tightly around her

          chest, face to the sky as a smile breaks free across her

          face.

           TRAVERS (V.O.)

                          (SINGING)

           Winds in the East

           Mist coming in--

          The shadow of an umbrella, floats higher and higher--

                          TRAVERS

           --Like something is brewing,

           about to begin--

          And further and further--

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)

           Can't put me finger on what lies in

                          STORE--

          We give chase but cannot catch up--

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)

           But I feel what's to happen, all

                          HAPPENED BEFORE--

          And the umbrella floats up, up, up into the atmosphere and

                         AWAY--

                          FADE OUT:

                         END
