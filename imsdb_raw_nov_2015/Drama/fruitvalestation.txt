      We open on an expensive looking flip cellphone sitting on a

      dresser. Next to it, a large zip lock bag of marijuana. We

      stay here.

                          OSCAR (O.S.)

                What's your resolution?

                          SOPHINA (O.S.)

                FUCK YOU...You just gotta help me

                stick to it. It only takes 30 days

                to form a habit. Then it becomes

                second nature.

                          OSCAR (O.S.)

                Really? Who told you that?

                            SOPHINA (O.S.)

                ... Oprah

      Oscar laughs hard at this.                                       

                          SOPHINA (CONT'D)                             

                What's yours.

                I'm gonna quit selling trees.                          

      The PHONE VIBRATES and RINGS "MARCUS CALLING" shows on the

      outer screen.

      Oscar's moves towards the cellphone.

                            SOPHINA (O.S.)

                Osc.

      Oscar stops in his tracks.

                          SOPHINA (O.S.) (CONT'D)

                Don't go out there tonight, stay

                home.

                          OSCAR (O.S.)

                You gonna give me a reason to?

      Sophina doesn't answer. The phone rings again. Oscar's hand

      quickly picks it up and flips it open. We follow the phone to

      his face and we see him for the first time, a 22 year old

      Black man with a warm smile.

                          OSCAR (CONT'D)

                    (into phone)

                Aye bruh it's bad tonight. I gotta

                catch you tomorrow.

      He closes it before the guy on the other end can respond. He

      takes the phone with him as he climbs back into bed with

      SOPHINA MESA, a curvy 24 year old Mexican American woman.

                          OSCAR (CONT'D)

                Look, I'm not going out, you happy

                now?

      Sophina nods. Oscar moves closer to her and kisses her on her

      neck. She kisses him back a bit, then scoots away.                  

      Oscar kisses her again. Puts his hand in her hair.

                          SOPHINA

                Osc. Osc, hold up.

      Oscar stops. Sophina scoots away even further.

                me, I can't help to think about how

                you was touchin that Bitch.

      Oscar shakes his head at this, sighs.

                          SOPHINA (CONT'D)

                You know what? You right, go.

                          OSCAR

                What I gotta do? I'm here, right

                now. I fucked up one time, alright?

                          SOPHINA

                No, you fucking got caught, one

                time. You gonna sit here and tell

                me that was the first time you

                seen her before that huh?

                Look I'm done with that shit. All I

                want is you and T, forever.

      Sophina looks at him, searching for the truth in his eyes.

                          SOPHINA

                What you mean, forever?

                          OSCAR

                Let me show you.

      Oscar kisses her, moves in. Sophina scoots away from him.

      KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. Oscar and Sophina look over at the door.

                          CHILD'S VOICE (O.S.)

      Oscar looks at Sophina.

                What? She's askin for you.

                    (to child)

                Hold on, T.

      Oscar jumps up and grabs the bag of weed off of the dresser

      and hides it in the closet.

      He rushes over and opens the door where we see TATIANA GRANT,

      a cute 4 year old girl, standing wearing footie pajamas.

                          TATIANA

                I can't sleep...

      Before Tatiana can even finish, Oscar has her in his arms. He

      brings her over to the bed and places her next to Sophina.

                          OSCAR

                You want to sleep in here with

                Mommy and Daddy?

      Tatiana nods.

                          SOPHINA

                You know better than that T.

                    (to Oscar)

                What time is it?

      Oscar picks up his phone and looks at it.

                          OSCAR

                Damn, it's after midnight.

      He opens his phone up. Presses compose text message (as he

      types the message, the words appear as graphics across the

      screen like Sub Titles)

                          TO MOM:

                HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!! LOVE YOU!!!

      Oscar sends the text off. He hooks his phone up to the

      charger and hits the light switch, leaving us in darkness.

                          TATIANA

                Daddy.

                          OSCAR

                Wussup, baby?

                          TATIANA

                I don't want to move to Livermore.

      Oscar and Sophina laugh at this.

      Oscar stands in the shower, letting the water run over his

      head. There looks to be a lot on his mind.

4     INT. OSCAR'S APARTMENT- KITCHEN- DAY                         4

      Sophina and Oscar move around the small kitchen like a well

      oiled machine. Sophina, wearing a WalMart uniform, makes two

      lunches. Oscar wipes milk from Tatiana's face and fixes her

      hair.

                          TATIANA

                Mommy can I have two of the fruit

                snacks today?

                          SOPHINA

                No, T. You can take an extra apple

                if you want.

                          TATIANA

                But mommy I-

                          SOPHINA

                Don't argue T.

      Tatiana pouts. Sophina downs a cup full of orange juice,

      grabs both lunch bags, Tatiana, and heads for the door.

                          SOPHINA (CONT'D)

                Com'on Osc. We gotta stop and get

                gas too.

                          OSCAR

                We got enough to get yall there.

      Sophina shoots Oscar a look.

                          OSCAR (CONT'D)

                Go start the car up. You got your

                Go. I gotta grab my beanie.

      Sophina and Tatiana leave. Oscar watches them go for a beat.

      He turns to the cabinet.

      Oscar and Tatiana walk to the downstairs entrance of a two

      story house. A picture of an apple tree is painted next to

      the door. Oscar squats down to her level and brushes down a

      frizz in her hair. He looks back at the car.

      We see that Sophina is adjusting her make up in the fold down

      mirror.

      Oscar turns to Tatiana. He then takes her hand, and places

      something inside of it.

      Tatiana looks down into her hand and we see that it is a

      small bag of fruit snacks. She looks up at Oscar with a

      bright eyed expression. But Oscar quickly places his finger

      over his lips.

      Tatiana nods in agreement, trying to hold back a huge smile.

      She gives him a swift kiss on the cheek. He stands up and

      knocks on the front door.

      MRS. STACY a motherly looking Black woman in her 50's opens

      the door.

                          MRS. STACY

      Oscar smiles at Mrs. Stacey, and she nods back. He watches

      Tatiana run off into house.

      Oscar and Sophina look on at the WAL MART Entrance.

                          OSCAR

                See? Told you we'd make it. The

                light aint even on yet.

      She looks at the dashboard where there is a PICTURE of Oscar

      holding Tatiana tucked in the glass. The fuel gage sits

      almost under E, but the light still isn't on.

      She stares at the store entrance.

                          SOPHINA

                You gonna go home and sleep, right?

                          OSCAR

                Naw, Imma go up to the job. Get

                some stuff for tonight.

                           SOPHINA

                Ugh. I'd rather die than come here

                on my day off.

                What time we supposed to be at your

                Prolly like seven.

                          SOPHINA

                We gonna go to Frisco again? Catch

                the fireworks?

      Oscar nods. Sophina smiles at the idea of Frisco, for a beat.

                          SOPHINA (CONT'D)

                Let me get in here.

       She quickly sits up. Oscar leans over to give her a kiss on

       the cheek, makes a farting sound on her neck instead.

       Sophina chuckles at this as she gets out of the car.

                           SOPHINA (CONT'D)

                 Bye.

                 Love you too.

       SLAM! Sophina shuts the door on him. Oscar laughs. His smile

       fades, as he watches her go inside.

       Oscar, now in the car by himself rides in the car listening

       to HIP HOP MUSIC. He comes to a red light.

       He looks at the car radio clock: 8:58 AM.

       He thinks to himself for a beat, he looks dissatisfied. He

       turns his music up for a beat and listens to it. He looks

       around, still not at ease. He turns off his music and pulls

       out his cellphone. He takes a quick look around to see what

       cars are around, before dialing numbers. CALLING MOM flashes

10     EXT. UPS WAREHOUSE ENTRANCE- DAY                             10

       A beautiful Black woman in her late 40's wears a UPS

       manager's uniform, this is WANDA JOHNSON. She walks towards

       the entrance of her store, when her cellphone rings in her

       purse. She pulls it out, stressed. Answers it without

       looking.

                           WANDA

                 Hello?

                           OSCAR

                 Last shot right here, you sure you

                 want to work on your birthday? You

                 still got time to catch a cold...

       Wanda's face brightens up with a familiar looking smile.

       Wanda laughs at this.

                            WANDA

                 As tempting as that sounds... this

                 place would be a mess without me

                 today.

                     (beat)

                 We close early though...

                           OSCAR

                 Okay...You still want me to get a

                 couple crabs, right?

                           WANDA

                 Yes, and can you pick some... are

                 you driving?

                            OSCAR

                 Yeah Ma.

                           WANDA

                 You wearing your earpiece?

       Oscar hesitates for a beat.

                            OSCAR

                 Yeah...

                           WANDA

                 Don't lie to me. That's all you

                 need is to get pulled over right

                 now. Put your earpiece on, Oscar.

       Oscar sighs... this is nothing new.

                 Hold on.

       He pulls the car over.

       He looks around for his earpiece for beat- no luck. He takes

       his cellphone, and slides it into the elastic of his beanie-

       a poor man's Bluetooth. He pulls off.

                            OSCAR (CONT'D)

                 Yeah Ma.

                           WANDA

                 Okay pick up a couple of packets of

                 dried shrimp too. Come by on your

                 way, I'll give you the money.

                           OSCAR

                 Nah Ma, it's good.

                           WANDA

                 Alright I'll pay you back tonight.

                           OSCAR

                 Ma, don't trip off that. I got you.

       Wanda pauses for a beat.

                           WANDA

                 Okay, so you're buying this, with

                 Farmer Joe's money... right?

                            OSCAR

                  Okay, well let me run in here. I'll

                  see you later tonight.

                              OSCAR

                  Love you.

                  Love you too.

        Wanda hangs up the phone. She looks at it for a beat. Then

        puts it back in her purse and heads into the warehouse.

A11     EXT. FARMER JOE'S PARKING LOT- DAY- MOMENTS LATER         A11

        We see the entrance of Farmer Joe's, and shoppers coming in

        and out. Oscar looks around for a beat, and takes off his

        hoody, and puts it into his back pocket. We follow him into-

11      INT. FARMER JOE'S- DAY- MOMENTS LATER                        11

        It is a moderately sized grocery store, but several SHOPPERS

        move about the aisles. Oscar walks over to the seafood

        section where Cato CALDWELL, a 22 year old charismatic Black       

        male stands behind the counter wearing a Deli apron.

        Cato sees Oscar and smiles brightly. He takes a pile of fish       

        off the scale, bags it, ands it to an older BLACK WOMAN. He

        takes off his clear glove and slaps hands with Oscar over the

        counter.

                            CATO

                 Oh yeah, tell Moms I said Happy

                 Bruh I wish I could, but I gotta

                 bust a couple moves tonight. What's

                 good for the countdown though?

                 Frisco. Fireworks and the whole

                 shit-

       Oscar sees something out of the corner of his eye. He motions

       his head for Cato to look. Cato turns and sees-                  

       KATIE, a White girl in her mid 20's, playing with her iPhone

       while waiting for help. Cato quickly makes his way over.

                 You ready?

                           KATIE

                 Uh, yeah... I want to get a pound

                 of, wait... Can I see what your

                 sole looks like?

                              CATO                                      

                 Sole?

       Cato takes a sidestep over to his left and motions to a pile     

       of fish.

                           KATIE

                 Yeah, no, wait. Your catfish. Let

                 me see what that looks like....

       Cato points to the catfish. Katie looks at it, then looks        

       down to her phone.

                           KATIE (CONT'D)

                 Okay but, I want to fry it. Like a

                 fish fry. Are these the ones you

                           KATIE

                 Okay, let me have a second.

       She looks back down at her iPhone, and takes a step back.

       Cato turns to Oscar.

                 Ahh, yeah. Something like that.

                           OSCAR

                 It's cool. I work here.

       She looks at Oscar suspiciously.

                 fish, like southern style. And I

                 maybe lied a bit, and said that I

                 know how to cook like that.

       Oscar laughs at this. Katie shakes her head.

                           OSCAR

                 Is he black?

       Katie blushes.

                 He's white. But he knows a lot of

       Katie looks down at her phone again. She uses her fingers to

       zoom in on something.

                           KATIE (CONT'D)

                 I'm not sure what type of fish he

                 wants. And most of these recipes

                 are different on this site.

       Oscar watches her with a look of pity. Suddenly, an idea

       flashes before his eyes.

       He pulls out his cellphone, quickly dials a number, and holds

       it to his ear.

                 playing on the phone.

                 fish does she want to fry?

                 Hold on.

       Oscar holds out the phone for Katie. She reaches out

       apprehensively. He gives her a reassuring look. She takes it.

                           KATIE

                    Hello, Grandma Bonnie, it's Katie,

                    Nice to meet you.

       Katie smiles and blocks her other ear to hear better.

                              CATO (O.S.)                                

                    Pssst!

       Oscar snaps his head to Cato, who motions for Oscar to look       

       down the aisle.

       Oscar looks over and sees, EMI, a thirtysomething Hispanic

       man wearing a white collared shirt and a name tag. He checks

       the shelves with a barcode scanning device.

       Oscar slowly heads over.

                              OSCAR

                    Good morning, Emi.

                              EMI

                    Oscar, what's going on??

                              OSCAR

                    Had to grab some stuff for my Mom's

                    birthday.

                              EMI

                    I hope you found everything that

                    you need.

       Emi turns and starts for the next aisle.

                              OSCAR

                    Emi, hold up man, I wanted to talk

                    to you.

                              EMI

                    It's a little nuts right now,

                    holiday and all. But what's up?

       Long beat.

                 Position's been filled. Take care

                 man.

       Emi turns to head down the aisle, Oscar reaches out and grabs

       Emi by his sleeve. Emi stops and turns around.

                           OSCAR

                 Look, I was going through some

                 shit, trying to get back on my

                 feet. But I need this job man. I'll

                 show up early every day. You can

                 start me back off with one shift a

                 week or whatever. I'm here. You can

                 work me 40 hours a week and pay me

                 for 20. I'm here.

                           EMI

                 Oscar, dude. I hired somebody else.

                 For me to hire you back, that means

                 I have to let someone else go.

                 Someone with no felonies. Who's

                 never showed up late once. I like

                 you man, but I can't do that. I'm

                 sorry. If something else opens up,

                 maybe I'll let you know. Take care

                 of yourself.

       Emi walks away. Oscar watches him.

                           KATIE (O.S.)

                 Hey!

       Oscar turns around to find Katie, holding out his phone for

       him to take. Oscar looks at her basket, it's now full of fish

       and supplies.

                           OSCAR

                 You sure you got enough?

                           KATIE

                 Oh my god, Your grandmother is so

                 sweet! I can't believe she was kind

                 enough to do that.

       She extends her hand to shake with Oscar. Oscar smiles,

       shakes it.

       Oscar shakes his head at this. Katie starts off towards the

       register.

                              KATIE (CONT'D)

                 Take care.

       Oscar's nods. He walks back over to Cato, who is weighing         

       fish for another CUSTOMER. He spots Oscar.

                              CATO                                       

                 How it go?

       Oscar smiles wide and nods. He reaches over the counter and

       grabs the bag of crabs, then bumps fists with Cato.

       Oscar places the bag of crabs in the refrigerator. He closes

       it and looks at the refrigerator for a beat. On it we see

       several drawings done by Tatiana held on the door by magnets.

       Oscar smiles at these. His phone rings: BIG SIS CALLING

       from off the BIRTHDAY FOR MOTHER rack.

       We see that on the card is a picture of a black woman walking

       on the beach holding her son's hand. Inscribed over it are

       the words to the religious poem "Footsteps" by Anonymous.

       Oscar's eyes quickly scan the poem: he's read it before.

       Oscar opens the card, and looks inside for a beat. He looks

       several large wooden tables with plastic chairs placed around

       them. There are a few VISITORS already sitting at tables with

       inmates. Several Corrections Officers stand by.

       We see Oscar, shirtless, arms behind his head, is looking

       through the glass window of the search room. A Corrections

       Officer is conducting a search. Oscar's face is bruised under

       his left eye, and there is a small white bandage strip on the

       left side of his face. He turns around, bends over and

       coughs. He turns back around, and the officer hands him his

       Blue shirt and pants. Oscar puts them on and-

       BUZZ. The door opens, and Oscar walks through the large room

       to Wanda's table. As he approaches she stands up.

                              OSCAR

                 Hey Ma.

       Oscar gives her a hug, leaning across the table.

                 What happened to your face?

                           OSCAR

                 You look nice.

       Wanda shakes her head.

                           OSCAR (CONT'D)

                 My girls come over last night?

       Wanda nods. Laughs a bit.

                           WANDA

                 We played board games.

                           OSCAR

                 "Candyland"?

       Wanda nods. Laughing a bit more now.

                           OSCAR (CONT'D)

                 Yall let her win too, I bet.

                              WANDA

                 Of course.

                 Yall hella weak for that. She gets

                 no easy victories with me around.

       Oscar smiles and notices Wanda is smiling about something on

       her mind.

                           OSCAR (CONT'D)

                 What?

                           WANDA

                 Do you remember that microwave

                 popcorn you bought a while back?

                           OSCAR

                 Yeah, the kettle corn. Hella good.

                           WANDA

                 Yes, kettle corn. I popped some of

                 that for us, and I was putting it

                 into a bowl. Tatiana's looking up

                 at me, like she wants something.

       Wanda starts to chuckle a bit again.

                           OSCAR

                 C'mon. What she say?

                           WANDA

                 She looks up at me and

                 says,"Grandma, do we have any dark

                 butter?"

       Oscar looks at Wanda with a confused look.

                           OSCAR

                 Dark butter?

                           WANDA

                 Yeah, I'm thinking she saw "Food

                 Network" or something. So I say,

                 "what's dark butter sweetheart?"

                 She says, "When Daddy took me to

                 see WALL.E he asked for light

                 butter, so I want to try some dark

                 butter this time."

       Oscar looks at Wanda with a bright eyed expression.

                           OSCAR

                 She is gettin way too smart.

       Another BUZZ from the door is heard.

       As the two share a moment, DANIEL CALE, a stocky white inmate

       in his early 30's walks past Oscar and Wanda's table. He has

       a large, square bandage under his left eye.

                           CALE

                     (just loud enough for

                      Oscar to hear)

                 This moms right here?

       Anger flashes over Oscar's eyes.

                           CALE (CONT'D)

                 She a snitch to?

                           CALE

                 Fuck you and that bitch.

                           OSCAR

                 You tough in here with these guards

                 huh?

       Two Corrections Officers move quickly over to Oscar's table.

       Cale, continues to walk towards a the table with the Woman

       and the Frizzy Haired Girl.

                           CORRECTIONS OFFICER 1

                 Is there a problem here?

                           OSCAR

                 Naw, we good.

                           CALE

                 That's my best friend right there.

       Cale flashes a mischievous smile.

       The Corrections Officer comes over and stands between the

       two.

       Oscar watches as Cale sits down across from the woman, who

       holds the baby. Cale smiles at the woman, and makes coochie

       coo faces at the baby.

       Woman passes the child to Cale over the table.

       Oscar looks on with malice.

                           WANDA

                 Oscar, Calm down.

       Wanda's voice snaps the anger off of his face.

       He looks back to Wanda, and his anger subsides.

                           WANDA (CONT'D)

                 What happened to your face?

                            OSCAR

                 Dark butter huh? She always

                 listening.

       Wanda stares at Oscar.

                           OSCAR (CONT'D)

                 She too smart for her own good man.

                 The preschool said we should think

                 about starting her in school early.

                 Phina tell you that?

       Wanda doesn't respond.

                           OSCAR (CONT'D)

                 Yeah, we're gonna put her in

                 private school. I was lookin at St.

                 Bede the other day. It's this other

                 school that starts them off

                 learning Spanish, then it gradually

                 gets them back going on English.

                 It's like a new thing-

                           WANDA

                 I'm not coming to see you anymore.

       Oscar stops in his tracks.

                           OSCAR

                 What you mean?

                 Tatiana doesn't deserve this. She

       Oscar takes this in.

                           OSCAR

                 She too young to know what's going

                 on right now.

                           WANDA

                 I guess that's why she asked me why

                 you love taking your vacations more

                 than being with her.

       Oscar cut his eyes from Wanda.

       Oscar ignores him, and continues to follow his Mom.

       The C.O. hits a button on his walkie, and motions to the

       other C.O.'s. They quickly move towards Oscar and attempt to

       We pull back with Wanda as she walks away, trying to hide her

       pain. Another Corrections Officer sprints past her towards

       Oscar, who we can still see in the distance.

       Oscar pumps his gas. He looks at a poster of Obama that reads

       CHANGE, posted on the gas pump. He looks across the lot and

       notices a Zales engagement ring poster.

       He pulls out his phone. Starts to text.

       He sends it off. Closes, waits for a bit. It buzzes. He opens

       it.

                           FROM SOPHINA:

                 ALREADY TOOK IT.

       Oscar puts his phone back into his pocket. He turns and

       begins to pump his gas. He sets the handle to automatically

       pump, and looks up and notices something.

       We see it is a gnarly- looking male PIT BULL sniffing around

       a few feet from Oscar's tires. It looks to be maybe 3 or 4

       years old. Oscar whistles at the dog and calls him over.

       Oscar pets him on the head, we see its ears are a bit

       scarred, but it has beautiful brown eyes. He feels around the

       dog's neck- no collar. Oscar looks around for an owner for a

       beat while the dog licks his hand.

       CLICK- Oscar's gas tank is full. He turns away from the dog,

       places the pump back on the base, and screws his fuel cap

       back in. He looks back to where the dog was and doesn't see

       him. He scans the block and panic strikes his face. He takes

       off running towards the street.

                           OSCAR

                 Shit! No, No, No Stop!

       SCHREECH... BAM! We hear it before we see it. A sickening

       sound. An animal YELPS, a car SPEEDS OFF. Oscar runs into the

       street chasing a car going too fast for us to see.

                           OSCAR (CONT'D)

                     (at the car)

                 Hey! Stop you bitch ass

                 Muthafucka!!

       He stops, turns around, and runs over to something lying in

       the street. It's the dog, and he's in bad shape. Oscar picks

       the dog up out of the street, and places him on the sidewalk.

                           OSCAR (CONT'D)

                     (whispering)

                 Come'on boy. Come on.

       The dog's breathing grows more struggled.

                           OSCAR (CONT'D)

                     (to himself)

                 Shit.

       Oscar continues to pet his head. The dog starts to violently

       shake...

       He becomes unnaturally still.

       Oscar stares at the Dog for a long beat, shaken up by this.

       He looks around, no one seems to have noticed.

       He bends down, closes the Dog's eyes, and heads for his car.

23     EXT. POINT EMERY- PARKING LOT- DAY                        23

       It is an empty parking lot next to a beautiful view of the

       Bay. Oscar's car pulls up. After a short beat. A Lexus pulls

       up along side of it. Marcus hops out of the Lexus and walks

       over to Oscar's car.

24     INT. SOPHINA'S CAR                                        24

       Oscar leans over and opens the passenger side door for Marcus

       to get in.

                 Shit bruh I didn't think we was

                 ever gonna link up. You been good?

       Oscar stares out of the window.

       Marcus makes a face.

                 bruh. I needed that though...

                 What's the good news?

       Oscar turns to Marcus hands him a brown pre- rolled joint.

                           OSCAR

                 For your troubles.

                           MARCUS

                 Right on Osc bruh.

       He pulls out a wad of money.

                           OSCAR

                 It's good bruh. Take it.

                             MARCUS

                 You sure?

       Oscar nods.

                           MARCUS (CONT'D)

                 Right on bruh.

       Marcus pulls out a lighter.

                           MARCUS (CONT'D)

                 Burn one with ya boy right quick.

       Marcus lights up the joint, takes a hit, holds it out for

       Oscar, but Oscar just stares out of the Window.

                           OSCAR

                 I'm good, that's all you bruh.

       Marcus puts it back into his mouth.

                           MARCUS

                 Right on Osc, then bruh.

       They slap hands, and Marcus gets out of the car. We hear him

       get into his car, and start his car up. Oscar waits for a

       beat. He then reaches under his seat and grabs something.

25     EXT. POINT EMERY- SHORELINE- DAY                             25

       Oscar walks out onto the shoreline, looking at the water. He

       looks around for a beat. He walks all the way out into the

       water. Standing on rocks.

       He looks over both shoulders, to make sure no one is

       watching. He then goes into his waistband and pulls out the

       Ziplock bag of weed. He squats down, opens the bag, and dumps

       it into the water. He watches as the green buds float off.

26     EXT. WALMART ENTRANCE- CONTINOUS                          26

       Oscar walks up to the heavily crowded store entrance. We see

       Sophina exiting holding a large cardboard cake box. Oscar

       takes it from her.

       We follow Oscar as he turns the corner into a backyard full

       of toys and KIDS Tatiana's age. Mrs. Stacey watches them,

       smiling, but with vigilant eyes. Tatiana spots Oscar and runs

       up and gives him a hug.

       Oscar waves and smiles at Mrs. Stacey, who waves back. He

       walks over to the sign out sheet and grabs a pen.

       Oscar thinks on this, exits the kitchen in the direction of

       At her. She puts some pollo on a fork, and takes it over to

       As Oscar enters, we see Sophina is in her bra and panties,

       talking into her cellphone. She lays several different

       outfits out on the bed. Oscar closes the bedroom door, leans

       on it.

       eating at him. She puts the hoodie down, and walks over to

       him.

                 weeks ago.

                           OSCAR

                 I thought I was gonna be able to

                 get my shit back.

       Sophina looks at him and shakes her head.

                 So you would have just kept faking

                 like you were going to work? And

                 would have just been out bustin

                 I want you to be honest with me.

                 But off top. From the fucking jump.

                 What did you today. Hmm. I bet you

                 sold that fucking zip.

                 I dumped it. I'm done with that

                 aint working out.

       A long beat.

                  Gonna see if my sister can hire me

                  again, while I look. Maybe if I can

                  just not fuck up, for 30 days..

       Wanda, wearing casual clothes now, fills up a pot with water.

       Grandma Bonnie washes a basin full of vegetables.

                           OSCAR

                 Happy Birthday!

       Everyone greets each other.

                 Hey baby. You guys are just in

       Oscar sits the crabs down on the counter next to the sink. He

       gives his mother a big bear hug. She smiles, hugs him back

       just as tight. Oscar lets go and moves on to his grandmother.

       Sophina and Tatiana come give Wanda hugs.

       Wanda and Grandma Bonnie begin to take the groceries out of

       the plastic bag. Wanda pulls out two massive crabs. Looks in

       the bag and sees the third.

       A large pot is placed atop the gas stove. The burner blazes

       under it, as Wanda drops the now clean crabs into the bucket.

       She drops in the vegetables and begins to stir. Bowls are

       grabbed by everyone and they are filled up by Wanda, with

       white rice first, and then the brown gumbo is poured over it,

       along with large pieces of un- cracked crab.

       Everyone eats their gumbo in the kitchen. Laughing talking.

                 shape for them to hand it over to a

                 black guy. Look, if Bush hadn't

                 have messed the country up so bad.

                 Oh, Come'on Ma, don't mention it.

                 You shouldn't even be doing this.

                           WANDA

                 I enjoy washing dishes. It's

                 relaxing.

       Oscar rolls his eyes at this. She hands him another dish.

                            WANDA (CONT'D)

                 I really enjoyed having you here.

                     (beat)

                 You think it's safe for me to get

                 used to having you around?

                           OSCAR

                 I told you. I aint missin no more

                 parties.

       She looks at Oscar for a long beat, searching for the truth

       in his eyes. She finds it.

                           WANDA

                 You guys got plans for tonight?

                           OSCAR

                 Probably just catch the fireworks,

                 and then roll around after that.

                           WANDA

                 Roll around?

                           OSCAR

                 Yeah, just chill, we'll be cool.

                 Sophina's got work in the morning

                 too.

                 I'm sure they will. I'm not gonna

                 be drinking.

       Wanda looks at Oscar, not buying it. Oscar laughs.

                           WANDA

                 Why don't you catch BART out there?

                 That way you can drink and hang

                 out, and not have to worry about

                 anything.

                           OSCAR

                 Yeah we might catch BART.

                           WANDA

                 No traffic either. You know its

                 gonna be crazy. Going and coming

                 back.

                           OSCAR

                 Yeah, we might have to do it.

                            WANDA

                 Promise me, if you and your friends

                 go, you'll catch the train.

                     (beat)

                 I'm serious.

                           OSCAR

                 Okay, I promise.

                           WANDA

                 Aight. Don't make me follow you

                 guys to make sure... you remember

                 Prom.

       Oscar laughs at this so hard he has to sit the bowl. He pulls

       out his phone and starts to text.

                           TO CATO:                                     

                 Let's catch BART out there. Tell

                 everybody to meet at South Hayward

                 Station.

       He presses send. He picks the dish back up, and dries it. His

       phone buzzes. He look at it.

                           FROM CATO:                                   

                 Aight bet. We'll see you there in

                 minute.

       Oscar, Sophina, and Tatiana say their good-byes to Grandma

       Bonnie, and Uncle Daryl and Uncle Ceephus.

       Oscar walks up to Wanda.

                           OSCAR

                 Alright we out, Birthday Girl. Love

                 you.

                           WANDA

                 Love you too, son. And Happy New

                 Year.

       Oscar gives her a big hug and kiss, then turns and leads his

       family out of the door. Wanda watches them, and shuts the

       door behind him.

41     INT. SOPHINA'S CAR- LATER                                    41

       Oscar drives through Hayward in silence, turning his wheels.

       Tatiana watches out of the backseat passenger window with a

       solemn expression.

       She looks up at a bright flash of light in the sky. We see

       outside her window, a group of YOUNG TEENAGERS stand on a

       street corner and shoot off a Roman Candle.

       Oscar and Sophina sit in the front seat of the car. They both

       look tired. They look back at Tatiana who continues to

       lookout of the window.

                           OSCAR

                     (whispering)

                 You don't want to just call it a

                 night?

       Sophina thinks about this. Shakes her head.

                           SOPHINA

                     (whispering as well)

                 I want to go to the city... It's

                 Alright.

       They both get out of the car. Oscar grabs Tatiana and walks

       up to the house. He rings the doorbell.

44     INT. ROSE'S HOUSE- LIVING ROOM- CONTINUOUS                   44

       ROSE, Sophina's 27 year old sister, sits on the couch in

       front of a small television. She wears sweatpants and a pink

       T shirt.

       Sprawled out a pallate of blankets and pillows on the carpet

       are Rose's kids, (all Hispanic) Lala (8) Issac (6) twins

       Eilly and Angelo (5), Alena (2).

       The doorbell rings, and Rose gets up off of the couch and

       opens up the door.

       Oscar bursts into the living room.

                           OSCAR

                 Happy New Year!!!! ARRRGHHHH!!!

                           KIDS

                 Uncle Oscar!!!!!

       Rose's kids all jump up and growl back, mobbing Oscar, all

       smiles, clawing at his pants.

                           ISSAC

                 You gonna sleep over uncle Oscar?

       Oscar smiles at this, and shakes his head.

                           LALA

                 Pleeeaaaase mommy can Uncle Oscar

                 spend the night?

       Oscar struggles for a bit, laughing, Tatiana jumps into the

       fray, helping her cousins tackle her Dad. Oscar, gives up,

       laughing, and falls to the carpet.

       Rose and Sophina look on at this. Sophina laughs, Rose

       doesn't.

                            ROSE

                 C'mon Osc, I just got them ready

                 for bed...

                 No!

       She backs up smiling, and laughing.

                           OSCAR

                 You want your teeth to rot? And

                 your breath to smell like gumbo?

                           TATIANA

                 Yes!

       Oscar looks at her seriously.

       picking her up. Rose's Kids laugh and follow Oscar towards-

45     INT. ROSE'S HOUSE- BATHROOM- NIGHT                           45

       It is a modest bathroom. Oscar sits Tatiana on a wooden stool

       in front of the sink.

       Tatiana gets ready to place the toothbrush into her mouth but

       stops. She looks up at Oscar.

                           OSCAR

                 What?

                           TATIANA

                 You had gumbo, too.

       Oscar looks back at Tatiana guiltily.

       Oscar puts Tatiana into her pajamas. Sophina stands in the

       doorway watching them.

                 You guys aren't gonna sleep over

                 too?

                           OSCAR

                 Me and Mommy are gonna go see some

                 friends for a little bit. We'll be

                 right back.

                           TATIANA

                 But I don't want you to go.

                           OSCAR

                 We'll be back, in a few hours I

                 promise.

                           TATIANA

                 But you should go to bed. You

                 already brushed your teeth.

                 Remember?

                           OSCAR

                 I know, I know. But me and Mommy

                 promised our friends we would go

                 and visit them. We'll be back

       Oscar leans over and gives Tatiana a kiss on the cheek. He

       gets up and gets ready to leave.

                           TATIANA

                 Nooo! Don't go.

       She grabs his arm. Tears well up in her eyes.

                           TATIANA (CONT'D)

                 I'm scared.

                 I hear guns outside.

                 Those are just firecrakers. You'll

                 "Toys R Us?"

       The group starts walking towards the BART turnstiles. Talking

       as they walk. Jason leans in and whispers to Cato.

                 What about Twenty Twenty though?

                 for the New Year.

       Oscar smiles, takes it. Drinks a small shot, and hands it

       back to Brandon. Brandon lifts the bottle up at Oscar like a      

       toast.

                           BRANDON (CONT'D)

       He takes a quick swig. Oscar gives Brandon a "What the fuck       

       are you talking about" look. The group laughs at this, and

       follow Oscar's lead towards the station entrance.

       moves through the crowd to the back of the car he pulls open

       the doors and the group enters-

53     INT. SAN FRANCISCO BOUND TRAIN- CAR 2- CONTINUOUS          53

       Oscar looks around and heads over to some standing room next

       to where DANAE a gorgeous Black woman in her late 20's sits

       wearing a ball gown and leather jacket.

       Across from her sit KAREN and DONALD, a White couple dressed

       in similar clothing. There is an empty seat next to Danae,

       but Oscar, Sophina, Tim, Kris, Vanessa, and Carlos all remain      

       standing. Brandon, however, slides into the empty seat. He         

       puts his arm around Danae's seat.

                           BRANDON                                        

                 Make sure you keep your hands to

                 yourself...

       The group laughs at this. Danae turns and looks at Brandon,        

       who is making a funny face at her. She can't hold in her

       smile.

       Brandon takes his arm down and offers her the bottle of            

       Hennessy- she declines. He turns to Karen and Donald, and

       offers it. Donald opens his jacket and pulls out a flask. He

       lifts it at Brandon, smiling. Brandon lifts his bottle in          

       return. The both take a swig.

       dollar bills sits in front of him.

       As the group passes the Musician, Cato drops a dollar in his       

       hat.

       Oscar looks from closed store to closed store, the group

       following closely behind him. He spots Sammy, Middle Eastern,     

       Early 50's, closing the metal gates on his store.

       Oscar trots up ahead of the group to Sammy.                       

                             OSCAR

                 We're all closed.

                           OSCAR

                 I know man, but a couple young

                 ladies with me really got to use

                 the bathroom man.

                 even have a rest room for

                           OSCAR

                 But you got one for employees

                 right?

       Sammy ignores him.                                                

       Sophina, Vanessa, and the rest of the group gather behind

       Oscar now.

       Sammy shuts the gate and pulls out the key.                       

       Oscar sees this. He turns to Sophina and Vanessa who look as

       if they are both about to explode.

       Oscar goes into his pocket. He pulls out a $10 bill.

                 Now you can take this $10, and open

                 the store up and let them use the

                 bathroom. Or you could go home, and

                 These two right here.

                 Thank you so much.

       He nods and opens up the door. Oscar steps over and tries to

       hand him the $10 bill, but Sammy waves it off.

       Oscar turns around sees PETER a white thirty something guy in

       a North Face jacket. His wife STEPH, 30's is six months

       pregnant, and is doing the same potty dance we saw earlier

       from Vanessa.

       Oscar pounds on the glass door of the liquor store. Sammy        

       walks out into view. He lifts his hands, "What?"

       Oscar points to Steph. Sammy opens up the door.

       Steph looks at him with puppy dog eyes. Sammy breaks down and    

       lets her in.

                 Money.

                            PETER

                 Shitty reason. When we got married,

                 we had nothing. Lived in the back

                 of her parent's house for the first

                 two years.

                 might as well be the same thing as

                 far as money goes.

                 Yeah man, I told you, I had

                 nothing. I used to be good with

                 credit cards if you know what I

                 mean. I wouldn't go that route if I

                 were you though man.

                 Yeah, I'm straight off that.

                 Yeah. I ended up getting locked up

                 for a bit. My wife had to sell the

                 ring to bail me out.

                 Got my business going about a year

                 after I got out, and got her the

                 doesn't matter. If she loves you,

                 any ring'll do.

                 nicest backyard. Tell all your boys

       The three girls, Sophina, Vanessa, and Steph make their way

       out of the Store laughing like best friends. Sammy follows         

       them and closes the door.

                           STEPH

                 Okay.

                 Thanks again, and take care man.

       Peter and Steph head down the street.

       Oscar, Sophina, and Vanessa cross the street to meet the rest

       of the group.

                           KRIS

                 This was a burnt ass mission. Let's

       The group nods, and they head back across the street walking

       briskly.

       The platforms is PACKED. The group comes off the stairs and

       we see a train is already there, doors open.

                           CATO                                           

                 Come'on bruh, this us.

       Cato cuts through people to get close to the train entrance.       

       Oscar grabs Sophina by the hand and follows closely behind

       Cato.

                 Hold up, bruh bruh.

       The rest of the group passes up Oscar, following Cato. We see    

       through the windows of the train that each car is full to the

       brim. Standing room only.

                           OSCAR (CONT'D)

       Cato jumps onto the train, Sophina does as well. Oscar looks     

       around for a beat, and then steps on.

       We stay outside of the train as we watch the doors close

       behind him, and the train takes off. The cars go by, picking

       up speed rapidly until we are left looking at a dark empty

       tunnel. We hold on this.

       It's a multi ethnic sardine can. Oscar holds on to the

       on his chest.

       The train begins to slow down, and a LONE COMMUTER, stands up

       and move towards the door. Sophina sees the open seat and

       quickly slides into it. Oscar remains standing uncomfortably.

                 Find a spot... I'm good.

       Oscar nods, and begins to looks around the car for a less

       dense section. He makes out a small space in the corner of

       the train car, and starts towards it. He passes by an OLDER

       COUPLE, white 40's. This is MR. and MRS. ZAFIRATOS. They

       stand next to their SON (9)and DAUGHTER (14).

       As Oscar pushes past him, Mr. Zafiratos gives Oscar an

       unwelcome look. He pulls his daughter away as to avoid Oscar

       bumping up against her. Oscar exchanges a look with him

       briefly, and continues to push towards the space.

       The Train comes to a stop, and commuters crush onto the car.

       We see Katie, from Farmer Joe's, standing a few people in

       front of Oscar wearing a jacket over the same outfit. She's

       hugged up with JOE, a handsome white man in his 20's wearing

       a CAL sweatshirt. He holds her protectively.

       DING. The doors close, and the train takes off.

       Katie closes her eyes and leans into Joe's chest for a beat,

       then Joe pulls her out of the way of a passenger who squeezes

       by. Katie opens her eyes, and sees that the passenger is

       Oscar. Her face lights up.

       Oscar turns around a bit confused.

                           KATIE (CONT'D)

                 Right here. Its me, from Farmer

                 Joe's.

       Oscar continues to look, until he hears a MAN'S VOICE from

       right behind him.

                           MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

                 Oscar? Oscar the fucking snitch?

       E.C.U. OSCAR'S FACE

       Oscar recognizes this voice, and he doesn't like it. He whips

       around to find, standing a few people away---

       Cale, wearing an oversized white T shirt, and a multitude of

       tattoos on his forearms. With him are FOUR LARGE HISPANIC

       MEN, and his GIRLFRIEND.

                           CALE

                 Wussup with that shit you was

       Cale moves towards Oscar.

       Sophina sees the commotion going on and stands up and looks,

       sees Oscar about to be surrounded. She starts towards him.

                           SOPHINA

                 Osc! Osc whats going on?

       Oscar cuts his eyes from Cale to Sophina.

       BOOM! Cale punches Oscar in the right side of his face-hard.

       Oscar rebalances himself and punches back, with three quick

       shots to the head and chest. He moves like an experienced

       fighter, but both men struggle in the crowded train.

       The other passengers begin to shout and try to move out of

       the way.

       Sophina sees this, and turns to their group of friends who

       are at the back of the train.

                           SOPHINA

                 Fuck these niggas bruh!

       Brandon pushes past Mr. Zafiratos who is holding his             

       daughter. And looking on at the fight.

                           MR. ZAFIRATOS

                 Watch it! You're gonna get somebody

                 hurt!

       Cale moves in and grabs Oscar, putting him into a headlock.

       Oscar grapples with him, holding his other arm to avoid being

       punched in the head.

       Cato and Brandon push through to be in arm's reach of the

       Cale flush in the back of the head.

        Sophina, Vanessa, Kris, and Carlos, Brandon, and Tim walk          

        towards the escalator. Kris out ahead of Sophina and Vanessa.      

        Sophina, Vanessa, and Kris, make it past the cops, but             

        Caruso stops Carlos, Brandon, and Tim. The officers pull out       

        their tasers and back the three boys up against the wall.          

        Brandon takes off his jacket and Caruso takes it, searches it      

        and throws it. Brandon says something to Salazar, and Caruso       

        roughly slams him against the wall.                                

        Caruso turns back towards the train, and seemingly makes

       Oscar turns and tries to hide in the crowd He tries not to         

       look suspicious, but he sticks out like a sore thumb on this

       car. He sees Cale and his friends in the crowd And Zafiratos.      

                             CARUSO (O.S.)

                 If you were involved in the fight

                 get the fuck off the train right

                 now!

                 pull you off. This ain't my first

       Mrs. Zafiratos looks at Oscar.

                 People have families on here.                            

       There is a visible commotion at the door, and passengers

       start to move back, we see Caruso storm through the car

       doors.

       He looks around the crowd, and makes eye contact with Mrs.         

       Zafiratos gives a subtle look over at Oscar.

       Caruso sees Oscar and makes his way towards him.

                 What are you talking about? What

                 did I do?

       Caruso pulls out his taser and points it at Oscar's neck.

                           CARUSO

                 Come on. Let's go.

       Oscar immediately puts his hands up.

       behind his back.

       He picks Jason up by the handcuffs, and drags him towards the

       Oscar looks at this in shock. He turns his attention back to

       Brandon, who still is standing. Salazar pushes Brandon in his

       Salazar pushes at Brandon again, and Oscar reaches out his         

       hands to stop her.

       BOOM! Caruso punches Oscar flush in the right side of his

       face, knocking Oscar's head up against the wall.

       Ingram reaches for his taser, pulls it out. Cato keeps              

       recording, but backs up.

       Newsome and Sanchez run over to keep Cato back. Newsome             

       stands in the view of Cato's camera phone. Ingram turns and         

       jogs over to help Caruso.

       Caruso arrives next to Ingram, who turns to him.

       Ingram nods. He points his taser at Oscar and Brandon. Oscar     

       takes a picture of Ingram pointing his taser at Brandon with     

       his cellphone. His phone rings in his hand.

       He checks it: "Sophina Calling". He answers it.

        Ingram finishes searching Oscar only finds a wallet. He's

        sweating bullets. Caruso runs over to Ingram.

                            CARUSO (CONT'D)

                  What the fuck happened?

        Ingram can't answer. Caruso snatches Oscar's wallet out of

        his hands and waves him away. He and bends down and un-cuffs

        Oscar. He rolls him over and we see Oscar's eyes are starting

        to grow distant.

        They ignore her, and quickly get into the elevator with their

        gear, the doors close behind them. Sophina hears COMMOTION

        coming from the escalators. She looks over and sees Brandon        

        kicking and struggling, as the Cops bring him down. Cato,

        The Cops stuff Jason into the back of their car before he can      

        answer. They stuff Tim into the same car.                          

        It takes four Cops to get Brandon. Another group of Cops are

        off his shirt. They flip him over, revealing a large entry

        wound on his left shoulder blade. It bleeds profusely.

        SURGEONS, and PARAMEDICS move around Oscar.

        The LEAD SURGEON, a tall, slim Black man in his 50's, points

        to an object that lies just under Oscar's right clavicle,

        just under his skin.

        CLOSE ON OSCAR'S CLAVICLE

        The surgeon takes a scalpel and cuts into Oscar's skin, just

        above the protruding mass. Blood runs out, he presses down

        and pops out the bullet, that looks like a large metal

        mushroom. The surgeon examines it.

                  Jesus. It's like it hit something

                  solid. Bone wouldn't do this.

        He places the bullet into an empty beaker atop a cart. He

        turns back to Oscar and begins to stitch up the incision. The

        Lead Surgeon looks at xrays of Oscar's chest on a light

        board. Paramedic 2 stands over his shoulder.

                  what's causing the pulse problem.

        CLOSE ON OSCAR'S CHEST

        The Surgeon sticks a tube into the right side of Oscar's

        chest, and blood flows out of the tube uncontrollably.

        Spilling onto the floor.

        Oscar lies on the operating table, sedated. The Surgeons talk

        medical speak. They move with astounding quickness and

        precision. Lead Surgeon takes a large scalpel, and makes a 14

        inch incision under Oscar's right nipple.

        Blood rushes out, it's worse than they thought. It begins to

        hit the floor. A RESIDENT SURGEON reacts to this, and quickly

        grabs a large emesis basin. He puts it underneath the wound,

        catching the blood. Another Surgeon places a spreader into

        the wound, and opens it up.

        The Lead surgeon looks inside of the incision. He lets his

        head down in frustration at what he sees.

                  My son is Oscar Julius Grant III.

                  He's been shot, and they told me to

                  come here-

        The Nurse sits at the computer.

                  He's still in the operating room.

                  Go to the ICU waiting room and                         

                  someone will be out soon to let you

                  know everything that's going on.

        Wanda nods and walks over towards the chairs.

                            WANDA

                      (under her breath)

                  Lord please let him be okay. Please

                  watch over him with your healing

                  hands Lord. Keep him Safe Lord.

                  Keep him safe so that I can hold

                  him once again.

121     INT. OPERATING ROOM- MOMENTS LATER                       121

        The operation is fully underway. A surgeon removes Oscar's

        lung from the incision.

        We see a NURSE change out a bag of Donor Blood on one of the

        many IV systems Oscar is hooked up to. She tosses into a bin,

        where it lands atop five other empty bags.

        Wanda sits in the waiting room next to Sophina.

        The Boys storm into the room along with JACK BRYSON SR. a

        Hispanic looking man in his 40's. Kris greets the boys, and

        they head over to Wanda.

        He stands close to his sons Jack and Tim. The Nurse walks out    

        from behind the back room with the Lead Surgeon, who now

        wears fresh scrubs.

                              LEAD SURGEON

                  Wanda?

        Wanda nods, and stands up.

                            LEAD SURGEON (CONT'D)

                  Oscar was shot, okay? We've

                  stabilized him, but he's in

                  critical condition. The bullet

                  caused massive internal bleeding

                  and we had to remove the right

                  lung.

                            WANDA

                  His lung? How is he... How is he

                  going to be able to breathe?

                            LEAD SURGEON

                  Well, his breathing isn't our

                  concern. It's the bleeding. We're

                  working very hard to get his blood

                  to clot. But right now, his body

                  isn't taking the transfusions.

                  But he's going to make it right?

                            LEAD SURGEON

                  Hard to say, but we're gonna do

                  everything we can okay?

                            WANDA

                  Okay, okay. Please do whatever you

                  can, okay? My son is a good boy.

                  Please do what you can. Please.

        He nods and pats Wanda on the shoulder for a beat, then turns

        and heads back into the ICU. Wanda walks back over to the

        group. She gives them the news from the doctor.

124     INT. ICU RECOVERY ROOM- MORNING- FEW HOURS LATER         124

        Several Nurses Operate around Oscar who still lies

        unconscious his breathing sounding more struggled than ever.

        Suddenly blood begins to run from his right nostril, then his

        right eyelid, and his left nostril after that. His EKG

        machine begins to BEEP loudly.

        The Nurses go into panic mode.

126     INT. ICU RECOVERY ROOM- MORNING- CONTINUOUS                 126

        Lines of blood trickle from Oscar's eyes, nose, and mouth.

        The Lead is now in the room and has taken over commands.

                            NURSE

                  Loosing a pulse.

        Oscar's body begins to violently shake.

        A young male RESIDENT DOCTOR, grabs the paddles, the Lead

        Surgeon touches Oscar's chest, we see under his skin is

        filled with fluid. He taps the Resident Doctor on the

        shoulder and shakes his head. He looks up at the clock.

                            LEAD SURGEON

                  Calling it. Time of Death 9:01 am.

        He pulls off his mask, frustrated, and walks out. Oscar's

        convulsions stop. A morbid, continuous beep echoes from the

        EKG.

127     INT. ICU WAITING ROOM- DAY- MOMENTS LATER                   127

        The Lead Surgeon walks out, and Wanda is still in the circle

        praying. The Nurse goes over to her, pulls her aside.

        Wanda approaches the Lead Surgeon with a hopeful look in her

        eyes. She reads his eyes for a beat.

        The Lead Surgeon looks at her for a beat. And shakes his

        head. Wanda puts her face in her hands, her legs wobble.

        Sophina who was watching and listening closely sees this. She

        breaks down, buries her face in Oscar's hoodie.

        Daryl and Ceephus run over to Wanda, just as he arrives, her       

        legs buckle a bit, he catches her.

        Oscar's friends begin to break down.

                  heaven with him.

        Tatiana looks at Sophina for a long beat.

                                                             (CONTINUED)

                   But I don't want Daddy to live in

                   heaven. I want him to be with me.

                             SOPHINA

                   He can't. Once you go to heaven,

                   you can't come back.

      Tatiana thinks about this.

                             TATIANA

                   Well does he have his cellphone?

                   Maybe if I call him and talk to

                   him, he will come back.

                             SOPHINA

                   No. Daddy doesn't have his

                   cellphone baby. You can't call him

                   where he is.

                                                        FADE OUT.
