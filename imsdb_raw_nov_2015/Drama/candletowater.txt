               There's never been anyone like

               you, since you. I love you

               Vaughn. I love you like no-one

               else ever has, or could. I'm not

               Just follow your heart. OK?

   FADE IN ON

   1.01 INT. SALOON CAR  EVENING

   The car is stuck in rush-hour traffic, which surrounds VAUGHN

   (40), as he wrestles with the hardest decision of his life.

   He speaks into the car mobile phone kit microphone.

                            VAUGHN

               I don't know. I mean I want

               you, I want to be with you.

               You know that. It's just . . .

   He glances at his mobile phone in its car kit dash cradle. The

   display says `OFFICE'. The lights of cars outside illuminate

   the falling snow, which is beginning to settle on the road.

   He waits. No response. No need for one.

                            VAUGHN

               Can you . . . just give me

               twenty four hours  OK?

   Beat. The dashboard lights seem swirl around him. Stress.

               Are you lost? You sound lost.

                            VAUGHN

               Thought I'd try a new way home.

               Beat the traffic, you know.

He looks at the sea of cars around him sardonically.

                           BROOKE OS

                        (phone filter)

               A little girl fell in love with

               a little boy. Still falling

               over here!

Her laughter sounds loud on the car phone speakers.

                            VAUGHN

               OK  I'll call you, babe. OK?

Beat. The dashboard lights. Snow. Rush hour. Stress.

His satnav sounds bizarrely loud, suddenly:

                         SATNAV VOICE

               In point two of a mile, keep

               right . . .

               (beat) I love you Vaughn.

               Once upon a time.

Vaughn takes a deep breath, loathes the traffic outside.

His phone display indicates another incoming call: `Mia'.

                            VAUGHN

               I love you too. I gotta. . .

               I'll call you  OK. Bye baby.

Vaughn looks at the incoming call display message. His finger

hovers between the `accept' or `reject call' buttons.

                            VAUGHN

               I have to go. I'll call you. . .

               What does that mean? Look you

               know how it is. I'll see you

               very soon. Always  OK? Ciao baby.

No response, then her call is killed her end.

Vaughn waits a moment. He takes a deep breath. The world seems

to crowd in on him. He presses the call `accept' button.

                            VAUGHN

               Mia. Hi honey.

1.02 INT. SUBURBAN SEMI  DAY

Vaughn sits in the conservatory and drinks his morning tea.

His gaze out into the garden is broken by something in the

cup, in the tea, that gets his attention. Troubled and

preoccupied, he frowns as he looks at the tea in the tea cup.

His daughter PIP (8) rushes into the conservatory in her

pyjamas and throws herself on him  her beloved, wonderful

                                PIP

               Daddy!

Vaughn catches her and tickles her and laughs with her. But

his indecision darkens his tired eyes with stress.

1.03 INT. GARDEN SHED  DAY

Vaughn SAWS wood fastened in a workbench vice. The usual

garden shed clutter of garden furnature and bikes around him.

There is a tense, manic regularity to his saw strokes. A

sound, OS, makes him stop sawing:

                              MIA (OS)

               We're off.

                           BROOK VO

               Once upon a time.

Pip says something inaudible outside.

Vaughn goes to the shed door. He doesn't really look outside.

                            VAUGHN

               OK. See you later.

He half waits for a response, but when there isn't one he

returns to the workbench. He re-grips the saw and starts to

saw again, but the saw gets jammed in the wood. Vaughn tries

to saw/free it with increasing desperation and anger until we

1.04 INT. SUBURBAN SEMI  DAY

Vaughn pretends to read the paper in the kitchen. The front

door opens. The voices of Mia and Pip approach, OS.

MIA (30s) enters the kitchen with several shopping bags.

She doesn't look at Vaughn.

Vaughn watches in a distracted way.

                             MIA

               Pip - you helping me or what?

Pip's footsteps climb the stairs. A girly grunt, OS.

                             MIA

                   (not looking at Vaughn)

               Any more takers?

As she speaks, SUPER/SUBTITLE the real meaning of her words:

               What the fuck is wrong with you?

4|Page

Vaughn grunts something, then goes to help her; but it's half

hearted. He can barely remember where the cereal goes.

                             MIA

               Wrong time of the month?

Vaughn laughs slightly too loudly. Still no eye contact.

His mind elsewhere, he helps her put the shopping away.

Mia takes a deep breath to control herself.

                             MIA

               Don't worry. Seriously.

SUPER

           I love you with every fibre. To the end.

Vaughn holds a can of soup - all that's left of his dignity.

Mia puts the shopping away in the cupboards and the fridge.

The tension is palpable. Silence strangles them both.

Mia finishes putting things away without looking at him.

The last item goes in the last cupboard. Bags are stored.

A beat. Vaughn's body is wracked by guilty tension.

                              MIA

                    (still no eye contact)

               You out later then darling?

SUPER

                 Don't do this to me - please?

Vaughn hides his torment and indecision as best he can.

                            VAUGHN

               Yeah. Probably. I don't know.

SUPER

                   I don't love you anymore.

                           BROOK VO

               Just follow your heart. OK?

Mia takes the can of soup from him and puts it away.

               Fine.

                     Do I disgust you that much?

Mia leaves the kitchen without looking at him.

Vaughn, Mia and Pip sit at the table eating lunch.

                             PIP

               But why not? Daddy said we

               could. Daddy?

Vaughn reacts half-heartedly but lovingly to Pip. Mia pretends

everything is fine: the stiffness of her body and the smile.

                            VAUGHN

               I'm not sure sweetheart.

                           BROOK VO

                     (seductive whisper)

               You promised.

Vaughn looks at Pip's hands. Innocence. The stony road ahead.

                             MIA

               Daddy's not feeling too well,

               darling. I'm sure a swim

               will do us all good.

The lack of eye contact with Vaughn speaks volumes.

                             PIP

               Daddy? Please? Mia said you'd. . .

Mia chastises Pip.

                             MIA

               Mummy. It's mummy! Who's Mia!?

                                 PIP

               Mamma Mia!

Vaughn manages to smile. He wants to throw up.

               our lunch go down. I'm fine.

SUPER

             Daddy you are a lying piece of shit.

1.06 INT. SUBURBAN SEMI  DAY

Mia bustles Pip out of the front door. Pip is in tears.

                             PIP

               But why can't daddy come?

Vaughn stands in the kitchen doorway.

                             MIA

               Come on. Milkshakes later!

There's a crack in Mia's voice that destroys Vaughn.

Mia closes the door after them. He sees their shapes through

the frosted glass of the front door. Ghosts. Departing. Gone.

1.07 INT. SUBURBAN SEMI  DAY

Vaughn sits staring unseeing at the TV, which babbles Saturday

afternoon crap. He picks up his mobile. He thumbs through his

text messages. He opens one. It says `Do it. Do it for me. For

us! xxx' He stares at it. He suddenly stands, takes a deep

breath and gets control. A decision makes itself.

1.08 INT. SUBURBAN SEMI PIPS BEDROOM  NIGHT

Pip lies in her bed. Scared, she hears her parents' voices

through the wall. Anger and resentment, sadness and shock.

1.09 INT. SUBURBAN SEMI MASTER BEDROOM  CONTINUOUS

Wracked with self-loathing, Vaughn stands awkwardly beside the

bed. Mia stares at him, incredulous. Tears blur her eyes.

                             MIA

               I've given you every last atom.

She expresses the giving of herself in an unconditional way.

Vaughn tries to express something  anything. He fails.

1.10 EXT. / INT. SALOON CAR  NIGHT, LATER

Outside the house Vaughn throws an overnight bag onto the back

seat of the car. He gets into the car. He slams the door shut,

grips the steering wheel. The enormity of it is impossible.

He doesn't look up at Pip looking down at him from her bedroom

window. That would break him. Worse, it might change his mind.

He starts the engine.

1.11 EXT. PLAYGROUND  DAY

Vaughn sits on a bench and waits. He pulls his coat around him

against the biting cold. He checks his mobile again. Nothing.

The unthinkable crosses his face. Surely not. But then

BROOKE (38) walks across the playground toward him. She sees

him, hurries. It takes him a moment to recognise her. That

troubles him. He smiles at her  his first smile in a long

time. Her smile speaks of very real joy after very real pain.

He stands in order to greet her. She tries not to cry, but

it's impossible. She embraces and kisses him passionately.

She looks at him like he's all she ever wanted. He sees

disguised scars on her face. The scars of pain in her eyes.

                            BROOKE

               Vaughn Black. Will you come

               out and play?

She holds him, lays her head against his chest.

                             BROOKE

               Thank you.

She has found her home in him. And he is unsettled.

1.12 INT. CHEAP FLAT  DAY

Brooke opens the door of the fridge in the kitchen for Vaughn.

                            BROOKE

               Beer, water or tea? The world's

               your oyster.

Vaughn smiles at her, looks around. It's pretty crummy.

               How long have you been here?

               White, one sugar. Thank you.

SUPER

              This is going to work. All I want!

She does a little dance for him, bows low.

                            BROOKE

               My lord.

She smiles her love. He accepts it. He wants it  all of it.

She puts the kettle on. A beat of silence.

                            BROOKE

               What you did . . . I mean I

               appreciate what you've done

               for me  for us. All I can tell

               you is that it will be worth it.

               We're meant to be together, V.

               You've always said that.

His mobile phone bleeps a text message. He ignores it.

                            VAUGHN

               Come on. You don't owe me

               anything. I made a choice.

He grabs her, kisses her. He looks like a man trying to

convince himself that if he ignores it, reality will go away.

Emotion overwhelms her, so she gets busy with the tea. Vaughn

looks around again, and out of the window. A cheap view, too.

                            BROOKE

               I've been waiting to show you.

She smiles again. Taking her cue, he looks at the portrait

photography on the walls in the living room. It's brilliant.

                            VAUGHN

               My God, Brooke. It's . . .

He is lost for words.

                            BROOKE

               You want to grab a shower. We

               should go out and celebrate.

She does another little dance of joy.

                            VAUGHN

               You're telling me I stink. Mea

               culpa!

                            BROOKE

               No!

She screams a little, laughs a lot. She buries her nose in his

armpits  or tries to. They play-fight and kiss. The kiss

develops into more. She wants him. They are lost in each other

until Vaughn slows them down, pulls back slightly, gently.

                            VAUGHN

               I'll take a shower.

                            BROOKE

               I'll show you. Might even

               watch you. A man in my shower.

               The little boy a little girl fell

               in love with. Once upon a time.

                            VAUGHN

                       (the boy inside)

               He's still in there somewhere.

                            BROOKE

               And now . . .

The kettle boils. It doesn't turn itself off. They hold each

other's eyes. The kettle over boils. The thing between them

builds and builds until she suddenly laughs and turns the

kettle off. He indicates upstairs, and then exits upstairs.

She watches him go. Her excitement is obvious. If she senses

that something is wrong, there is no outward sign of it.

1.14 INT. CHEAP FLAT  HALLWAY - NIGHT

Dusting snow off them, Vaughn and Brooke come through the

front door, which Brooke closes behind them. They're drunk,

laughing, and sexual. Snow falling is visible outside.

1.15 LATER INT. CHEAP FLAT  BEDROOM - NIGHT

Vaughn and Brooke fall onto her bed. They undress each other.

The momentum builds until knife scars on Brooke's body are

revealed. He sees them. She turns the light off, tries to hide

them. She tries to make light of it but she's ashamed of them.

The momentum of their desire founders, and stops.

She smiles at him, gets under the duvet. He stands awkwardly

beside the bed a moment, and then gets in beside her. They lie

separately for a moment, and then Vaughn embraces her softly.

She pulls the duvet up to her neck to hide her body totally.

Mia drives then stops the car down an isolated country lane.

Her mask of courage shatters: she begins to weep like a child.

1.19 EXT. CHEAP FLAT  EVENING

Vaughn pulls up in his car after work. He gets out. He looks

at the deep tracks his car has made in the WHITE snow. He

looks at the outside of the flat. He hesitates, then goes in.

1.20 INT. CHEAP FLAT  CONTINUOUS

Vaughn enters. Brooke rushes to him, smothers him in kisses.

They hold each other. For a moment he is free of care.

                                 BROOKE

                    Good day, bad day . . ?

SUPER

                       If this doesn't work . . .

Vaughn struggles to find an answer to such an inane question.

                                 BROOKE

                    Got something for you lover-boy.

SUPER

                           I will do anything.

She steps back, does a `ta-dah!' and gestures towards the

1.21 INT. CHEAP FLAT - KITCHEN

Brooke leads him in by the hand. A new suit, some new shirts,

new business and casual shoes, and some men's accessories lie

on the kitchen table. Dirty crockery lies in the kitchen sink.

He goes to the new gear, handles it, and smiles at her.

                                 VAUGHN

                    Thank you.

SUPER

                    Why didn't you tell me!? Stupid!

                                 BROOKE

                    So now you've got everything

                    you need here. So now . . .

SUPER

               It will be your fault, your responsibility.

He takes her hand, glances back at the unwashed dishes.

                                 VAUGHN

                    Brooke, look. . .

                              VAUGHN

               My love.

He pulls her too him. She smarts at his strength, so he holds

her gently, nurtures her. They kiss. Their passion builds.

1.22 INT. CHEAP FLAT BATHROOM - EVENING, LATER

Vaughn and Brooke shower together. He washes her body gently.

1.23 INT. CHEAP FLAT  BEDROOM - EVENING, LATER

Vaughn and Brooke get into bed together. Candlelight

illuminates their naked bodies and throws shadows around them.

They start to make love, but then Vaughn stops.

She is deeply hurt, but puts a brave face on it.

He doesn't know what to do.

                            VAUGHN

               What happened?

                            BROOKE

It's awkward between them: her pain and his change of heart.

1.26 INT. SUBURBAN SEMI  DAY

Vaughn enters the house awkwardly. Mia avoids his eyes.

He's wearing the new clothes Brooke bought him.

                             VAUGHN

                          (eventually)

                Pip's with mum?

SUPER

                       What have I done?

An emotional wreck, Mia nods.

                              VAUGHN

                How is she?

SUPER

               My family is my world. Forgive me.

                              MIA

                Don't start, Vaughn. What kind

                of a fucking stupid question

                is that? How's my daughter

                now that I've walked out on her

                and her mother and run into

                the arms of my childhood

                sweetheart?

Vaughn is clearly shocked that Mia knows what she knows.

                              MIA

                Jesus  the false caller IDs on

                your phone. `Office'? I mean

                please. And remember eye contact?

                You should try private browsing 

                or at least clear your history

                every now and again. For someone

                who's in fucking IT . . . So

                what now? You want some clothes,

                your tool box, the toaster:

                a divorce?

Vaughn doesn't know what to say, how to react.

                              MIA

                Have them all. On the house.

She can't hold it back any longer. She weeps her agony.

15 | P a g e

                             MIA

               Now fuck off, please? It's

               over. You piece of shit . . .

She stumbles at him, pounds him with her fists; but when she

hits him she recoils from the contact with his body.

She wipes her hands of the contact with him.

                             MIA

               What am I supposed to do now,

               bastard: tell me, tell me, tell. . .

She collapses, sobbing uncontrollably.

Vaughn glimpses something through the living room door he

hasn't seen before: a WHITE feather lying on the dresser.

It holds his attention until he exits the front door.

1.27 INT. SALOON CAR  EVENING

Vaughn sits in rush-hour traffic. The cars ahead of him are

moving, but he sits static, staring ahead. Car horns blare.

His satnav sounds bizarrely loud, suddenly:

                         SATNAV VOICE

               In point two of a mile, keep

               right . . .

Snow outside. The dashboard lights seem to swirl around him.

1.28 INT. CHEAP FLAT  EVENING

Vaughn enters. He puts his brief case down.

                            VAUGHN

               Babe? (nothing, so) Brooke?

Brooke suddenly jumps out from behind the kitchen door.

                            BROOKE

               Boo!

She laughs and runs toward him, but he isn't impressed.

               What's wrong?

                      Blimey  someone lost their

He's rained on her parade, and now he feels like crap.

                                   VAUGHN

                      That's brilliant. When?

She twirls a seductive finger around his tie. They kiss.

1.29 INT. CHEAP FLAT  BEDROOM - EVENING, LATER

Vaughn and Brooke begin to make love in bed. It's better this

time: their passion builds; it's going to be OK. But then

He begins to falter and she begins to cry. Her cry becomes a

SCREAM

Vaughn pulls back from her, looks at her. Her terror.

                            VAUGHN

               Tell me! For God sake . . .

She suddenly seems alone, naked on the bed. She tries one last

time: she goes to him, touches him; but he can't respond.

He realises. And now her dream is over.

                            VAUGHN

               Who did this to you?

                            BROOKE

               Does it matter? He was jealous.

               He's everything you're not.

               Vaughn? You love me. Baby?

               You don't need to fear him.

               They're just scars. Oh God, no.

               Vaughn? They're just scars

               for God sake. This is my body!

Vaughn searches for words, but he finds only his reality.

Reaching critical emotional mass, she gets up quickly, puts

the overhead light on. It seems stark and horribly bright.

She weeps, reveals her damaged knife SCARRED body to him.

                            BROOKE

               Can you see properly? Can you?

                            BROOKE

               Smart question Vaughn, smart.

He looks at her. He sees suicide in her eyes.

She suddenly lunges for him, starts to punch him. To Vaughn

this now has the quality of a nightmare. This is impossible.

                            BROOKE

               Love me.

They struggle. She's no match for him, but he is half hearted.

                            BROOKE

               Love me!

He takes it. She smashes at him. His nose and mouth bleed.

                            BROOKE

               Love me, bastard! COWARD!

She SCREAMS like a wild animal, goes to punch him again; but

Vaughn SNAPS: he lashes out at her, sends her flying

backwards. She lands badly, gasping with pain and shock.

Vaughn's bloody mouth begins to form the word `sorry' again.

                            BROOKE

               It doesn't matter. (long beat)

               Go back to her. Go back to mama.

               It's where you belong.

Vaughn stands there panting, bleeding; wishing he could cry.

FADE IN ON

2.32 INT. STORAGE DEPOT  DAY

BLACK, OVER-POLISHED SHOES

The shoes SQUEAK as the man wearing them walks down a lino

floor. These are the kind of shoes worn by a man who works

long hours on his feet. It becomes clear that the man has a

very slight limp. He walks down a strip-lit corridor in

2.33 INT. STORAGE DEPOT  DAY

A LONG, BLEAK CORRIDOR

The man who wears the shoes is MO (30s)  a very well-built,

dark haired guy with a sensitive yet watchful and angry face.

Mo is a security guard; he wears security guard paraphernalia

on his uniform belt: keys, torch, walkie-talkie etc.

He stops and listens, so the slightly uneven SQUEAKING stops.

He hears distant voices in the

2.34 INT. MAIN WAREHOUSE - DAY

This place is huge. It's also soulless and grim. Row upon row

of gated storage areas are crammed with peoples' belongings.

Between these rows walks CY (50s) with female admin staffer

DOLORES (40s). Cy has a dishevelled look of a man who has

stopped searching for his dreams. Self-dissatisfaction, hatred

even, haunts his tired face. He doesn't want to be here.

                           DOLORES

               . . .though normally there's

               a charge for that.

                              CY

               Of course there is.

They approach a storage area numbered 110. Dolores reaches for

a skeleton key attached to her belt by a security chain.

20 | P a g e

                             DOLORES

               Here we go.

Dolores unlocks the storage area. She pushes the door open.

                           DOLORES

               There you go.

Cy enters the storage area. He starts rummaging through boxes.

A door opens and closes in the distance.

Dolores' mobile rings. She answers it.

                            DOLORES

                       (into the phone)

               Well I can't be two places at

               once, now can I. (then) Sure.

               (then) Mo's around somewhere.

               No. (then) I will. (then) OK.

She ends the phone call, looks OS.

                           DOLORES

               Here he is now. (calls out) Mo?

A slightly uneven SQUEAK approaches.

Mo rounds a corner at the end of a storage row.

                           DOLORES

               Mo? Mo  could you please just

               see Mister Caudwell out? He

               just needs to pick something up.

There is an unusually long delay before Mo responds.

Mo approaches, and stops when he reaches DOLORES.

                                MO

               No sweat Doll.

                           DOLORES

               Dolores! How many more times?

But she's smiling. There's familiarity between them. When Mo

smiles, however, the smile seems out of place on his face.

                              MO

               No worries Doll.

21 | P a g e

Mo laughs. A strange laugh. She throws him an angry face.

                           DOLORES

               Sorry mister Caudwell. Mo here

               will see you out. I have to . . .

She heads off, pulling one last face at Mo as she goes.

                              CY

               OK (indifferent) thanks.

Cy's voice is barely audible as he rummages in boxes.

Mo looks in at him. He gets a text, checks it, and responds.

With a `ha!', Cy pulls something out of a box. Mo waits. As he

does so, he shifts his weight from his right foot to his left.

Cy emerges from the storage area looking flushed with effort.

                              CY

               Thanks.

                              MO

               No sweat.

Mo goes to lock storage area 110. Cy looks at the object he

has retrieved: an old VHS video cassette. Mo sees it.

                              MO

               Wow  that's an old VHS isn't it?

                              CY

               It is indeed. Are we done?

Cy speaks to him grudgingly. He wants to get the hell out.

The door locked, Mo starts to walk away from 110 with Cy.

                              MO

               Ain't seen one of those for

               years. Never used one.

                              CY

               Really.

Cy walks way ahead of Mo. The hell out of here.

                              MO

               Wait  I gotta sign you out man.

               Paperwork. You got the forms?

22 | P a g e

                              CY

               Man? What the hell happened

               to `sir'?

His disgust is obvious in the way he avoids looking at Mo.

                              MO

               Sir? You're a knight? The

               queen dub you or something?

               If I don't call you sir that

               doesn't mean I don't respect.

               It just means I don't call you sir.

                              CY

               Fine. It doesn't really matter.

               Sorry.

Cy walks faster but Mo knows he doesn't know where he's going.

Mo looks more closely at him.

                              MO

               Wait  you're that director.

                              CY

               Can we please just finish up

               and go. I'm late.

                              MO

               Seriously  I know you. I'm an

               actor. We met once. Maybe . . .

Cy keeps walking but doesn't know where he's going.

                              CY

               You've got the wrong man.

                              MO

               No seriously. We met at an

               audition. You auditioned me.

Cy just speeds up.

                              MO

               You must remember. I'm not doing

               this forever. Got plans to do

               things. Get my CV together. You

               must remember.

                              CY

               Like I said . . .

23 | P a g e

Cy won't slow down, so Mo puts a hand on his shoulder.

                              CY

               The fuck do you think you're

               doing?

                              MO

               Take it easy. I'm only asking.

Cy looks at him for the first time. Mo sees his bitterness.

Cy turns away to carry on walking. He's lost.

                              CY

               How the hell do we . . .

He looks around. Left or right?

Mo gets his mobile out. He goes to photograph Cy.

                              CY

               What the hell are you doing?

                              MO

               Come on man  just a j-peg to

               let my buddies know I saw you.

               I photograph everything. Got

               gigs of shit at home. But you 

               you're the man who directed. . .

Cy turns away, irritated. He looks around  up at the roof.

                              CY

               A sign or two might help.

                              MO

               Exit? It's cool. Listen we

               won't do the (indicates his

               phone, which he puts away). . .

               But slow down: you must

               remember me. You're  that's it:

               name begins with C. . .

                              CY

               OK. What the fuck is the matter

               with all this? I've got my thing,

               now I just want to get out of

               here. Let's sign the papers 

               and I can't quite believe there

               are papers  and I'm done. Clear?

24 | P a g e

They stand at a junction between rows. Left or right?

                              MO

               Clear. So what's on the (the

               VHS) video?

Mo laughs a little at the whole idea of a VHS.

                              CY

               Jesus. Mind my business is on

               the video. Is that all right?

                              MO

               It's fine, bro; but hostility

               ain't working. Not in here.

Cy looks around. It seems like a labyrinth.

Mo clicks his fingers, remembering suddenly:

                              MO

               It was that show - that play you

               were directing. Silver something.

               Shit. Four, five years back.

               Come on, man  you must remember.

                              CY

               OK. I remember. So can we go now?

                              MO

               Sure, but look: what's with all

               the storage. You moving house

               or something?

                              CY

               Something like that. Look: show

               me the way out of here now, man,

               or I'll have to speak to your

               supervisor. What was her name?

               Dorothy?

                              MO

               Shit no: Doll's just admin.

               Works up in the box.

Mo looks up and waves to a CCTV camera.

                              MO

               Dolls in the doll house, doing

               doll things. Bless.

25 | P a g e

                              CY

               Out. Now.

Mo's attitude changes noticeably in response to this.

                              MO

               Whoa. Relax Mister C. Out is

               way. OK?

Mo leads Cy off. Cy is suddenly more wary of him.

They walk in silence a moment. The uneven squeak.

                              MO

               Look I don't want you to mind

               me talking to you and all. I'm

               just being friendly: one pro

               to another. (beat) Come on man.

               Don't go believing this is

               my shit, because it ain't.

               Acting's my shit just like

               directing's yours. I was born

               to it  know what I mean?

               I knew you'd remember. Cy 

               that's it! Cy. Mo.

He offers his hand to shake. Cy takes it very grudgingly. They

shake hands. Cy fully takes in Mo's physical size and power.

                              MO

               Well that's better. No need

               for hostility between pros.

Mo lets go of Cy's hand. Cy is relieved. They walk on.

                              CY

                  (looking around for exit)

               How hard can this be?

                              MO

                    (as Cy speaks, above)

               Pros or ho's  know what I'm

               saying.

Mo laughs. It's a strange sound.

                              MO

               What's on the video? None of

               my biz, I know; but I'm curious.

26 | P a g e

                              CY

               If you must know, it's a show-

               reel. An old one.

                              MO

               Yup. Got the old bit. (looks

               at the VHS. Old) Wow. (laughs)

               Ain't you got one online?

               Mine's online.

They round a corner. Cy twigs they're back where they started.

                              CY

               Right. Get us the fuck out of

               here or I'm going to . . .

Cy reaches for his mobile phone. He goes to dial, but Mo

SMASHES

it out of his hand. It hits the floor and breaks.

2.35 EXT. STORAGE DEPOT  DAY, SAME TIME

People coming and going and cars and lorries and the city

skyline. Nothing out of the ordinary. The way things are.

2.36 INT. STORAGE DEPOT  DAY, SAME TIME

Cy stares at his smashed phone, at Mo. Mo's face is a mask.

The mask eventually moves. Confusion hits Mo's face. It's as

if another part of him did that, a part he can't control.

                              MO

               Look sorry about that dude, but

               you need to let me know. That's

               my simple question: what happened.

Panic starts to show itself in Cy's face. Deep down.

                                CY

               What happened?

                              MO

               The audition. I didn't get the

               job.

Mo shifts his weight from his right foot to his left.

Cy glances around, at his smashed phone on the floor.

27 | P a g e

He looks up, sees CCTV cameras. He stoops down to pick up the

parts of his broken phone. He finds the SIM card, pockets it.

There's something pathetic about the way he stoops.

                              MO

                         (eventually)

               Seriously. The Silver thing.

Cy stands, meets Mo's gaze full on for the first time, really.

                              CY

               Look I don't know. Actors 

               we would have seen dozens. I

               mean it was a long time ago.

               I don't know what you mean

               `what happened'.

Mo just looks at him. Unsettling.

                              CY

               If you didn't get it, you didn't

               get it. It's the - (nervous laugh)

               - it's the way of the world, no?

Mo just looks at him. A door opens and closes somewhere.

                              CY

               This is ridiculous.

Cy sets off on his own walking again. He's had enough.

                              MO

               I know how good you are.

Cy stops, turns. What?

                              MO

               I know your true potential.

               I know your talent doesn't

               belong packed up in here. Your

               greatness. And you've failed.

Cy swallows air.

                              CY

               What are you doing?

                              MO

               You don't think I know how you

                            (more)

28 | P a g e

                           (cont'd)

               feel. I feel it. In here. I

               feel failure in here every day

               and every fourth Sunday. I feel

               like brilliance left to rot,

               too. That's how you feel  no?

               You feel it when it wakes you

               to tap on your shoulder and

               say `this is what you could

               have been, this is what you are'

               Storage boxes? What happened?

                              CY

                          (shocked)

               What the fuck business is it . . .

               If I held an audition you failed

               four or five years ago I'm sorry.

               If you're working in here not

               up in lights, I'm sorry.

                              MO

               You're sorry for yourself.

               That's in your face.

Cy pulls himself together.

                              CY

               This is fucking absurd. (of

               his broken phone) Criminal

               damage. Threatening behaviour.

Cy starts off walking again. Endless rows. Junctions.

                              MO

               Cy  we're done here, seriously.

               Then I'll sign you out. You can

               ask about the mobile phone you

               dropped; but I doubt you can

               claim it on us. Just tell me

               why you're all stored up in here.

               Then . . .

He gestures then they're out of here.

                              CY

               Mo, isn't it? What does that

               mean  `Mo'? In any event I can

               promise you repercussions. I

               don't care what you think of me.

               I won't be treated like this.

29 | P a g e

Beat.

                              MO

               Brave Mister Caudwell. Genius.

               Solid citizen I don't think. Just

               need to know what you're doing.

               Then that's the end of it all.

Beat.

                              CY

               My landlord asked me to move out.

                              MO

               Couldn't pay your rent. Why

               don't you just say that.

               I couldn't pay my rent, Mo.

               That's fine. It's called la

               crunch du credit. And here we are.

Cy swallows, waits, looks for CCTV cameras.

Mo shifts his weight from his right foot to his left. In that

single moment Cy knows he's in a situation he can't control.

                              MO

               We're almost, nearly, seriously

               out of here, Mister Caudwell.

Some strip-lights turn off way down the warehouse.

                              MO

               On timers  saves power. You

               must know. Auto-ma-tic.

Cy glances at his watch.

                              MO

               Time to go home, Cy. My only

               ask is this. And you don't

               have to say yes, say anything.

               All I ask is we do it again.

Cy looks at him. Do what again?

                              MO

                       (strange laugh)

               I know. I know it sounds strange.

               Bit silly even. But if you just

               let me run the thing again,

               this time I'll nail it  swear.

30 | P a g e

More strip lights turn themselves out. Darkness builds.

                              MO

                  (of the VHS in Cy's hand)

               I mean. On a fucking VHS video

               cassette. Where's Noah when you

               need him?

He laughs. It sounds bizarre in the infinity of the depot.

Mo's suddenly killing himself laughing. Crying with it.

Cy starts to RUN.

Lightning fast, Mo intercepts him, grabs him, pulls him down.

                              MO

               Let's run this again from the

               top, Cy.

                              CY

               You'll go down for this. I

               absolutely swear. I'll report

               this to the police, your

               superiors. This is fucking . . .

Mo HITS him. Not a killer blow, but enough to shut him up.

2.37 EXT. STORAGE DEPOT  DAY, SAME TIME

People coming and going and cars and lorries and the city

skyline. Nothing out of the ordinary. The way things are.

2.38 INT. STORAGE DEPOT  DAY, SAME TIME

Mo leads/drags Cy towards a half empty storage area  222.

Holding Cy, Mo unlocks 222 and pushes Cy inside.

Mo locks the door behind them.

It's dark, and to Cy feels like a cage.

                              CY

               You think you can actually

               DO THIS?! What the fuck. . .

Cy screams `Help'. No response.

Mo looks around. He pulls up a box on one side, and sets an

old chair opposite it on the other side of the caged area.

31 | P a g e

Cy throws himself at the door, heaves at it.

                              CY

               What the fuck, sunshine. Equity

               subscriptions lapsing are they?

                              MO

               Cy, seriously, man who directed

               nothing: let's just get this

               right. Then we can get on

               with things. You can go back

               your self-loathing and I

               can continue my rounds.

                              CY

               What!? Screw you. (loud, to

               anyone again for help) FUCK YOU!

Mo smashes his fist into Cy's face.

                              CY

               What the fuck is the matter

               with you? Jesus Christ!

                              MO

               Jesus not in here, bro. Christ

               a nipple sucked by mugs. One

               born every minute, tick tock.

Mo flicks his keys around in circles. Shock grips Cy's throat.

                              MO

               OK. So what's the brief?

                              CY

               What?

                              MO

               What's the scenario? Set the

               scene for me. Point me in the

               right direction. Even Brando

               needed goalposts.

Cy looks around for escape. A phone rings, somewhere OS.

                              CY

               Help. HELP!

The phone stops ringing. A silent vastness of industrial dark.

32 | P a g e

                              MO

               No sweat, Doll. Just relax.

               This place is damn big. And

               you're talking to the big expert

               here. (shows Cy his shoes) Gotta

               do a circuit every hour. (beat)

               We gonna just do this thing,

               then it's home free. OK? Relax.

Cy tries to slow his breathing down, get a grip.

                              MO

               That's it old fella. Get sorted

               out. In and out. Let it all

               be cool.

Cy's breathing in the dark. Mo's keys. No way out.

                              CY

               You'll be missed.

He jerks his head. He means the office  colleagues.

                              MO

               Well not really Mister De Mille.

               It's just me and Doll today.

               Cutbacks. Don't ya love them?

Cy tries the door again, but it's half-hearted.

                              MO

               Set me straight, mister director!

Mo stands, suddenly, and comes over to Cy quickly. He grabs

him by the hair and forces him to sit down on the old chair.

                              MO

               The director's chair.

                              CY

               What the fuck do you want?

                              MO

               You know what I want. Just like

               you: another chance. Audition

               me again, you fucking VHS crumb.

               Give me my brief. Motivation,

               reality  the whole bit. Go.

Mo sits down opposite Cy on the box. He waits.

33 | P a g e

Cy stares at him. This is insane. But he has no choice.

                              CY

               Do what you want, wanker.

Mo immediately gets up, starts beating him to pulp.

2.39 INT. THE WAREHOUSE - DAY

Row after row of caged storage areas. Industrial vastness.

No hint of violence. No sign of anything wrong.

2.40 INT. THE BOX - DAY

This is where Mo should be: his security vantage point. A

crappy chair, a crappy desk, and CCTV monitors staring.

2.41 INT. STORAGE DEPOT  AREA 222 - DAY

His hands shaking and panting from the exertion, Mo

photographs Cy with his phone. Cy is beaten to a pulp.

                              CY

               You'll do time. Fucking acting.

               You'll go down. I'll see to it.

               Think you can fucking do this.

Mo applies lipstick, mascara and powder to his face. Lovely.

Then Mo sits down. Calm. Audition time.

Cy almost sobs. He spits blood.

                              MO

               Again. The scenario, please Cy.

               Who am I? What do I want?

                              CY

               OK crackerjack. Let's play.

               You're a fucked up wannabe

               actor who never was and never

               will be who works as a security

               guard in a domestic storage depot.

               Like most people you can't

               handle rejection, but I mean

               you really can't handle it 

               really I mean. It's just . . .

Lightning fast, Mo is on him, beating him shitless.

2.42 INT. THE WAREHOUSE - DAY

Dolores hums Gladys Knight and The Pips as she walks down a

cheaply carpeted corridor in the admin area of the building.

2.43 INT. STORAGE DEPOT  AREA 222 - DAY

Cy collapses under the onslaught of Mo's fists. Mo grimaces at

his damaged knuckles. He hauls Cy back onto the box.

                              MO

               Good dog. Now. . .

He indicates his readiness again, and waits.

                              MO

               That wasn't the character I read

               for, the last one I mean. My

               agent told me a soccer player

               who is afraid to tell his team-

               mates of his homosexuality.

               He turns to his manager for

               help, for answers to his

               dilemma; but in the face of

               this, of this outrage, the

               manager who has been like a

               surrogate father to him for

               years now turns against him,

               disgusted that the boy he

               believed in turned out to

               be a lamentable sausage jockey.

               Am I right?

Cy is too smashed and bloody and ruined to do more than grunt.

But something catches his eye; in the filthy gloom he sees a

WHITE feather lying on the ground in the corner of 222.

                              MO

               I'm right, man. That was the

               scenario wasn't it. The Silver

               thing I auditioned for that

               you turned me down for. Wrong.

               Ignored me for. Like the loser

               I was. Wrong. The winner is

               here. In front of you. So. . .

He smiles and waits for Cy to look at him to audition him.

                              MO

               Make like a camera.

35 | P a g e

At first Cy doesn't understand, but then he slowly,

agonisingly raises his hands up and mimes rolling a camera.

                                MO

               Noises.

It's hard for Cy to make the sound of a camera rolling.

2.44 INT. THE WAREHOUSE - DAY

Dolores sits down at her desk. Gladys Knight and The Pips.

2.45 INT. STORAGE DEPOT  AREA 222 - DAY

Cy mimes cranking a camera and makes camera noises. He glances

over to where the white feather was but now he can't see it.

                              MO

               Without a script this time,

               note. Ad-libbing, free wheeling

               improvisazione, herr director!

Mo looks into the `camera' and lives the role he's playing.

                              MO

                        (in character)

               All my life. Imagine living

               a lie  forever. Not just the

               lies everybody lives day to

               day to get by, play the game;

               but one big lie that stretches

               from beginning to end: a truth

               so hideous that it could be

               called ordinary. A verity of

               the genes, of psychology.

               And then imagine the one

               person the liar could turn to

               turning away, so that the liar

               was left with nothing but the

               lie. Imagine exploding with

               the desire to be what you

               are, to be real, and to be

               accepted for what you are,

               perhaps even loved. Not loved

               with money for playing games,

               but loved with respect for

               having the strength to stand

               apart. Imagine that. But the

               works of the imagination must

               cede to that we call reality.

                            (more)

36 | P a g e

                              (cont'd)

                  And here we are, you choosing

                  the side of the mob and me

                  left outside in the cold. Well

                  I've got news for you, turncoat:

                  I don't fucking care. I've got

                  the future. TTFN, blood. TT forever.

Mo ends the performance in tears. It's brilliant.

Cy continues to crank the `camera' and make camera noises.

Eventually Mo gets up and stops him with uncommon gentleness.

                                 MO

                  Cy. Director. Really.

He crouches down beside Cy, smooths his hair.

                                 MO

                  So, how was I? How was it?

It's agony, but eventually Cy manages to speak.

                                 CY

                  You did it. You got the job.

Mo stands, smiles, basking in his moment of glory.

This is his prize. This is his moment. But his face darkens.

                                MO

                  LIAR!

Mo starts to beat Cy gain, but this time he kicks him too. He

goes berserk, throwing Cy around like a rag doll, pulping him.

2.46 INT. THE BOX - DAY

Dolores enters.

                              DOLORES

                  Cuppa, Mo? Mo?

The room is empty. She approaches Mo's desk. She doesn't even

glance at the bottle of prescription pills, on which the word

`suppression' is just visible. She glances at the CCTV

screens. Nothing. She presses a button, bringing up the

display from another CCTV. She sees the grainy, monochrome

image of Cy's pulped face being smashed against the bars of

222. As she gasps in horrified reaction and grabs the phone

Footsteps and breathing: the SOUNDS of a young man running for

his life. The staccato pounding of his feet becomes a mantra

that builds until it develops a life of its own, and a surreal

edge. It becomes a ghostly, dreamlike sound  evil perhaps.

The running footsteps suddenly stop. The breathing continues.

                           JADEN VO

                      (between breaths)

FADE IN ON

3.49 INT. COUNCIL HOUSE  EVENING

AUSTEN (12) plays Skyrim on a brand new Mac PowerBook. The hi-

tech, futuristic sheen of the Apple is utterly at odds with

the room Austen is in: money seems to be in short supply here.

Austen is a cut and paste hoodie: a white boy going nowhere.

JADEN (18, white) enters. Lean and strong, Jaden is savvy 

but drugs have left their mark on his face and in his eyes.

                            JADEN

               What the fuck, my fam . . .

He grabs the Mac from Austen. They push and pull for it.

                            AUSTEN

               No way! Fuck off now, brah!

Jaden whacks Austen around the head  light, but hard enough

to break his grip. Jaden puts the computer to one side; the

way he handles it suggests that replacing it would be a synch.

Austen attacks him, but Jaden restrains him.

39 | P a g e

                            JADEN

               You got homework. Do the work.

                            AUSTEN

               Fuck that. Gimme . . !

Austen makes for the Mac again, but Jaden restrains him.

They fight a moment, but it's futile: Austen pulls back,

humiliated and outraged. He kisses his teeth and birds.

                            JADEN

               Don't be doin' that fam. It's

               all wrong. You ain't black yet.

                            AUSTEN

               Yeah? Well ain't you my brah.

                            JADEN

               I am your brah. No force gonna

               make me otherwise. Homework.

Austen switches the TV on, turns it up LOUD.

                            AUSTEN

               Fuck the homework. Fuck school. . .

                            JADEN

               Fuck ya future. Smart.

Jaden switches the TV off. Austen squares up to him. A beat

between him, then Austen backs down: Jaden is way too big.

                            AUSTEN

               Yeah well.

                            JADEN

               Yeah well. It all goes on the

               (taps his head) tab, right. Save

               it up for a rainy one. Then I

               get mine, right? Well I got

               mine, brah, an' you don't never

               want it  swear.

Austen storms out of the room.

                            AUSTEN

               Gonna get my own, white boy. See.

                            JADEN

               Home fuckin' work. Now!

40 | P a g e

Austen is now out of the room in the hallway beyond.

                          AUSTEN OS

               You ain't my dad, fam. My dad

               ain't my dad.

The sound of the front door opening and slamming shut, OS.

Jaden curses, thinks. Jaden is always thinking.

He exits suddenly.

CUT TO

3.50 EXT. LONDON E3  EVENING

Hood up, Jaden walks fast. It's dark already, and cold.

Jaden speeds up. He feels the reassuring bulge in his belt at

the base of his spine. He does this often, by habit.

He gets a text. He checks the message. Doesn't reply.

A police car cruises. Jaden doesn't react to it, but he does

so in a way that suggests that this is a measured response.

He grabs his phone, hits some keys. Someone picks up.

                             JADEN

                       (into his phone)

               Where you at fam? Nah. Nah. My

               brah  comin' atcha somewhere

               near? Yeah. See him? When?

               Owe ya back, boy. Easy now.

He kills the call, stows his mobile.

A car slows near him and stops at traffic lights. Jaden's

attention is drawn by a WHITE feather on the back window

shelf. A shadow crosses Jaden's face. The car pulls away.

He approaches a group of young male hoodies smoking and

texting outside a corner store. They greet with touched fists.

Jaden talks with a few of them, and then walks on. It's clear

that he has their respect, though they show it very subtly.

3.51 EXT. NEAR-BY

Cool and calm, Austen pockets a wad of cash. The youth he's

with stuffs something in his jacket pocket. They touch fists.

41 | P a g e

Austen goes on his way. He feels like a proper man. He walks.

He sees Jaden way ahead. Jaden sees him, starts running.

Austen runs. The streets blur around him into a narrative of

his life: the urban landscape dancing to the beat of his feet.

Runs, runs, runs

Jaden and Austen

They sprint the streets, the alleys, the music, and then

Jaden catches him and

GRABS HIM

ON Austen's snarl, FREEZE FRAME and

3.52 INT. E3 COUNCIL HOUSE  EVENING

In the kitchen-diner: Jaden, Austen and their dad: PAUL (50s).

Paul says a prayer before they eat their corner shop meal.

Jaden's hands are together in respect for Paul. Austen

deliberately pays no attention to the ritual at all.

                             PAUL

               . . . for this gift of daily

               bread we thank thee oh Lord. . .

Jaden throws Austen a look. Mean and fierce. And now suddenly

we see what he's capable of. Fear overcomes Austen's

arrogance. He puts his hands together and closes his eyes.

                             PAUL

               . . . and for the gift of these

               fine sons I thank thee oh Lord. . .

The crucifix on the wall. Christ's tormented face in the cheap

shadows of this dull, crappy kitchen. It's all Paul has.

                             PAUL

               . . . beseech thee to look down

               on them and protect them with

               thy everlasting mercy . . .

Seeing Jaden's eyes now closed in prayer for Pauls' sake

Austen can't resist feeling the wad of new cash in his pocket.

42 | P a g e

                             PAUL

               Thanks be to God. Amen.

The boys join him in `Amen'  Jaden properly; Austen barely.

They begin to eat their corner shop meal.

Austen sees a shadow cross Jaden's face as Jaden remembers

3.53 INT. E3 HOUSE  NIGHT

In washed-out, high grain:

Jaden necks and smooches with a black girl called LYCIA.

Around them the party pops: drugs and big bass and wannabe

cool young kids getting into each other or off on each other.

Lycia smiles and laughs and love the attention, but

A young black guy  J.C.  looks death at her, his girl, then

at Jaden, who meets the challenge of the alpha competition.

Jaden feels the bulge in his belt at the base of his spine.

3.54 INT. E3 COUNCIL HOUSE  EVENING, LATER

The meal over, Jaden does the dishes. Paul sits at the table.

Austen playing Skyrim in the next room is audible.

Paul breaks down in a fit of coughing.

Christ watches on.

                              JADEN

               Fuck.

Jaden suddenly leaves the sink and goes into the

3.55 INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING

Jaden grabs the Mac off Austen again. This time Austen cowers.

3.56 INT. KITCHEN - EVENING

Paul lights a cigarette. A moment's pleasure. He slips into

what might be a reverie, or just exhaustion. ON PAUL, hearing

this as Paul might - given his dislocated state of mind:

43 | P a g e

                           JADEN OS

                           (angry)

               Get with the fuckin' homework,

               swear . . . Told ya before get on

               with it . . . (calmer) One life,

               one chance, my fam . . . I help ya,

               no sweat . . . (angry again)

               Just get with it, ya little . . .

The sound of a punch, perhaps.

Paul flinches. He looks to Christ. Christ is tormented.

3.57 INT. E3 COUNCIL HOUSE  EVENING, LATER

Jaden lifts up a floorboard in his bedroom. He looks at his

stash of pills, rocks and a pipe. Half the rocks are missing.

3.58 INT. AUSTEN'S ROOM - EVENING

Jaden bursts in, but quietly. His silence doesn't diminish the

power of his intent. Scared, Austen's looks up at him suddenly

from his bed, where he plays Call of Duty on a TV console.

                            JADEN

                         (a whisper)

               What the fuck, brah. Who been at

               my stash  any thoughts? Or

               thoughts nowhere near that

               tiny size brain (raps on Austen's

               head with his knuckles)? No one

               messes with my stash  no

               matter who  hear? Ain't no

               brah of mine gonna sink to

               stealing and dealin' like some

               stinkin' hood rat skunk jus'

               to prove his manhood  readin'?

               I's fuckin' me and you got

               destiny, swear. Don't look

               to me. Don't like me. Don't

               follow me, don't run from me,

               don't watch me: just get wiv'

               the school shit and grow up

               like the old man wants  hear?

The potency of Jaden's emotion and words shocks Austen; but

now Austen shows nothing but the pride and power he admires.

Austen reaches into his jacket pocket on the chair by his bed.

44 | P a g e

                            AUSTEN

               Take the money, brah  just . . .

Jaden stops him.

                            JADEN

               Keep it. Buy books  study:

               something. Buy the old man a

               prezzie. If you ever do it again. . .

Austen nods reluctantly. He leaves the money where it is.

Jaden exits the room.

3.59 INT. PAUL'S ROOM - EVENING

Later, a knock on Paul's door. No response. Jaden pushes the

door open a crack, revealing Paul lost and alone on his bed in

a tiny sliver of light among infinite council house darkness.

Seen like this, the marks life has left on Paul are obvious.

                            JADEN

                         (a whisper)

               Goin' out dad  OK?

Paul just frowns. He seems too tired to speak. He expresses

`come back safely' in a way that is very hard to bear.

Jaden enters the room. He tucks his old man up in bed safe.

Then he leaves the room quietly and pulls the door shut safe.

He goes downstairs and exits the house quietly.

The ceramic Christ on the Cross in the hallway is silent.

3.60 EXT. E3  EVENING

Jaden walks. He is assured and cool. This is his stage.

He feels the bulge in his belt at the base of his spine.

He gets a text. He checks the message, likes it. He replies.

He greets a group of other hoodies with small talk and fists.

Done, he moves on down another street. He has goods to sell.

He takes a call, makes another, texts and talks. Smooth.

45 | P a g e

A BMW

Swerves near him, splashing him with headlights.

Jaden looks, sees faces he doesn't want to see.

He speeds up and then runs down a side street.

The BMW follows. Now Jaden

Runs, runs, runs

This is our first scene over again.

The streets blur around him into a narrative of his life: the

urban landscape dancing to the beat of his feet. But

Jaden wasn't born to run. Dodging up an alley he slows, turns.

The BMW doors open. Three men get out, follow him.

The glint and sound of shanks being drawn, ready.

Breathing hard but measured, Paul turns and faces them: a big

black guy, an ugly white guy and a tall Chinese guy.

Jaden feels the bulge in his belt at the base of his spine.

                            JADEN

                      (between breaths)

               Aight  am done runnin'.

               Do what ya gotta do.

The big black guy comes at him with the shank. It's J.C.  the

hood from the party. The other guys back him up.

                               J.C.

               An' all   dis for a three oh four.

               (kisses   his teeth) You could

               had her   anyways if you'd asked

               me nice   fam, swear.

J.C. lunges at Jaden. His shank cuts Jaden mid torso. The

other guys follow up, their blades flashing, searching.

Jaden withdraws the bulge at the base of his spine. His gun.

BOOM  his gun speaks - he shoots J.C. dead.

BOOM, BOOM

46 | P a g e

The gun speaks to the other two guys, killing China outright

and wounding the white guy badly. White guy falls, screaming.

                            JADEN

               Shut the fuck . . .

He kneels over white, tries to stop him screaming. But he

SCREAMS

over and over - blood pouring from his punctured chest.

JADEN

Looks around, desperate for him to stop it. Already

THE STREETS

around him are changing  as if they are turning to look but

WHITE GUY

Screams and grabs at his bleeding chest. His wild eyes beg.

JADEN

Begins to fold, to lose it as reality comes rushing in and he

SHOOTS

White guy dead. Shuts up. Silent streets. Then after forever

SIRENS

Grow out of the darkness.

Jaden throws his gun away instinctively. Incrimination. He

starts to run. Changes his mind. Turns and picks the gun up.

Sirens seem to haunt the city. And now Jaden

RUNS

So that the city is just lights and people and cars and noise

and people and darkness and people and there, amongst them

AUSTEN

Watching him, his brother and his idol. So now we

CUT TO BLACK

47 | P a g e

3.61 INT. / EXT. IMAGES, STROBE FAST:

Jaden crouches down in the darkness, blood on his hands, blood

on his shirt, blood on his cut torso, blood on his soul.

Jaden stashes his gun in a cloth under the floorboards.

Jaden is tormented by what he's done. Self-loathing.

J.C. and the other dead guys  a bloodbath. Sirens growing.

Jaden throws up on a street corner.

Jaden tucks his old man up in bed safe.

All the time

Austen seems to be watching, learning, admiring. Idolising.

CUT TO

3.62 INT. E3 COUNCIL HOUSE  EVENING

In the kitchen-diner: Jaden, Austen and Paul.

Paul says a prayer before they eat their corner shop meal.

Austen looks at the crappy bandages around Jaden's torso.

Jaden's hands are together in respect for Paul. Austen prays,

but is now confused. He's scared, but totally in awe of Jaden.

                             PAUL

               . . . for this gift of daily

               bread we thank thee oh Lord. . .

Jaden looks around his praying hands at Austen.

It's a look that Austen will never, ever forget.

3.63 INT. E3 COUNCIL HOUSE  LATER, EVENING

The Mac in the sitting room sits unused.

3.64 INT. E3 COUNCIL HOUSE  EVENING

The games console in Austen's bedroom sits unused.

3.65 INT. JADEN's ROOM - EVENING

Jaden winces with the agony in his cut bloody torso.

48 | P a g e

3.66 INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING

Christ stares unseeing in his ceramic torment in the kitchen.

3.67 EXT. E3  DAY

Austen walks home from school. Kids look at him.

Something has changed.

3.68 INT. E3 COUNCIL HOUSE  SHOWER - EVENING

Blood runs down the plug hole in the dirty bath.

3.69 INT. THE HALLWAY - EVENING

Austen hears the sound of the shower running. He enters

3.70 INT. JADEN'S BEDROOM - EVENING

He tiptoes to the floorboards near Jaden's bed.

He very cautiously levers a floorboard up. Crystals, pills,

pipes, weed  but much more than before. But not what he wants

to see. So Austen puts the floorboard back. He goes to the

door, listens again. The shower still runs. He tiptoes back to

Jaden's bed, looks around. He lifts up Jaden's pillow.

THE GUN

Sits there  sleek and cool and mighty and everything.

Slowly, daring himself, Austen goes to TOUCH IT. His fingers

linger on the smooth, cool, imperious steel. Austen is a God.

3.71 INT. E3 HOUSE  NIGHT

Jaden and Lycia make love. Slow and perfectly tender, and then

hard and porn. On and on. Bodies twisting in their search for

each other. They come - Jaden's body arching in torment.

LATER

Lycia cradles his head on her breasts. His breathing is

uneven, but then it evens out and slowly becomes calm.

She looks at his bandaged torso. She is afraid.

49 | P a g e

3.72 EXT. E3  NIGHT

Jaden walks the streets. Hoods look at and greet him in a

different way. Respect, but this is a dead man walking.

3.73 INT. / EXT. GOLF GTI/E3  DAY

Jaden drives Austen, who is in his school uniform. His hands

up on the wheel, the dragon tat on Jaden's arm is visible.

To Austen, Jaden looks a little pale, a little ill.

They see a cop car. Another passes them coming the other way.

                            AUSTEN

               Five oh everywhere. Wot's poppin?

                            JADEN

               Police. They're called police.

                            AUSTEN

               Bacon fryin' for breakfast.

Jaden throws him a look.

Their shared secret dominates their every breath.

                            AUSTEN

               Wot's poppin with the pussy, fam?

                            JADEN

               Jesus fucking Christ. You mean

               how's the young lady in your

               life, my blood? Since when

               the fuck you become some kind

               of born again reggin?

                            AUSTEN

               I wonder if you should mind

               you language in front of your

               baby brah, blood.

                            JADEN

               I say blood, you say blood. I

               say brah, you say brah. I say. . .

                            AUSTEN

               Potato, potarto, tomato, tomarto.

They drive a while. Then Jaden sees that Austen's hair 100%

exactly matches his own in terms of its length and styling.

50 | P a g e

                            JADEN

               You get your hair cut?

                            AUSTEN

               And?

They approach the school.

Austen glances at Jaden's torso and then gets out of the car.

                            JADEN

               Brah? You turn into me and

               I'll kill you - hear?

Austen looks at him. Tears well up in his eyes. He nods.

Emotionless, Jaden closes the car door and drives off.

On the pavement, Austen watches him go.

3.74 INT. E3 COUNCIL HOUSE  NIGHT

By torchlight under his duvet, Austen draws a `tat' on his

forearm with a biro that matches Jaden's real tat perfectly.

3.75 INT. JADEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Smoking a bong and drinking, his headphones on and the music

cranked high, Jaden fights an inner battle he can never win.

He looks at his gun on his bedside table. A thing of new evil.

Septic, the wound in his torso is draining him of life.

3.76 INT. CHURCH  DAY

Jaden and Austen kneel beside Paul in prayer. Except that

Jaden only kneels on one knee and Austen on neither; and

neither of them are really praying. Beside them Paul prays

with worshipers in the congregation of a dozen or so.

Jaden's hoodie hood is down out of respect. Austen has his

hoodie hood up. Jaden pulls it down. Austen throws him a look,

kisses his tongue. Jaden's eyes darken. Austen relents.

Jaden looks over, sees a man who seems wrong in here. He

twigs: plain clothes COP. Cops don't pray and this one is.

51 | P a g e

3.77 EXT. E3  NIGHT

Jaden sprints flat out through the people, cars, and lights.

At this speed his footsteps are barely a fluttering staccato.

He won't make it.

3.78 INT. E3 HOUSE  NIGHT

Lycia cowers in a corner. Three masked guys stand over her.

One has the shank pointing at her, accusing, hating her. This

guy is familiar. Broad, black, athletic, he is similar to J.C.

His name is LINDEN (30). He is J.C.'s brother.

FLASHBACK

3.79 INT. E3 HOUSE  NIGHT

J.C. looks death at Lycia, his girl, and then at Jaden, who

meets the challenge of the alpha competition. With other hoods

beside and behind J.C. stands Linden. Brothers to the end.

Jaden feels the bulge in his belt at the base of his spine.

BACK WITH

3.80 INT. E3 HOUSE  CONTINUOUS

Linden pulls his mask off, stares hatred at Lycia.

                            LINDEN

               Go fuckin' my brah's enemy, ho.

               My blood's white white enemy.

               For you he's dead. Fuckin' . . .

Linden starts slicing her face up. On her SCREAMS

CUT TO

3.81 EXT. E3  NIGHT

Jaden sprints flat out through the people, cars, and lights.

He rounds a corner in time to see Linden's car smoke away.

CUT TO BLACK

UP ON

52 | P a g e

3.82 INT. HOSPITAL WARD  DAY

A CIRCLE OF LIGHT IN THAT BLACK

Lycia lies in a hospital bed. Her whole head is bandaged.

SOUNDS of a busy hospital ward around them ebb and die.

Jaden holds her hand. He weeps.

CUT TO BLACK. UP ON

3.83 INT. E3 COUNCIL HOUSE  DAY

Paul brings tea into the living room for himself and the Cop

from the church. Austen stands uneasily near the door. In his

dress, haircut and demeanour he is a perfect model of Jaden.

                             COP

                          (to Paul)

               Thank you Mister Mountjoy.

               (to Austen) I don't want you

               to feel pressured, Austen. You

               haven't done anything, so relax.

Paul goes to Austen and puts an arm around his wonderful son.

The Cop sips the tea.

                         COP (cont'd)

               Oh thank you Mister Mountjoy.

               My brand: Costmart's own!

               (smiles, then, to Austen) All

               I need to know is where your

               brother Jaden is at the moment,

               Austen. When was the last time

               you saw him? You say he

               normally lives here: where is

               he now, today?

Confusion fills Austen's scared face. His dilemma is complete.

Silent in his agony, Christ watches on.

3.84 INT. JADEN'S BEDROOM  NIGHT

Austen lifts up the stash floorboard. There is nothing there.

53 | P a g e

3.85 INT. THE BATHROOM  NIGHT

Austen takes a breath, then slices his torso in the same place

Jaden was cut. He winces. He hadn't expected it to hurt this

much. Blood flows down and out of the crappy bath plughole.

3.86 INT. THE BATHROOM  LATER, NIGHT

Austen dabs at his new manhood wound, which won't stop

bleeding. There are mountains of bloody toilet roll on the

shelf and floor near him. On the toilet roll holder there is

no paper left. Austen looks at his new wound in the mirror.

He makes a gun of his hand and shoots himself in the mirror.

Cool.

3.87 EXT. LYLE PARK, CANNING TOWN, LONDON  EVENING

Fugitive Jaden stands looking into the flowing river. He is

pale and gaunt and dirty. Austen stands behind him. He looks

exactly how Jaden used to look. And his torso is bandaged.

Jaden squints at him.

                            JADEN

               Why you fuckin' grass me up.

               Though you was my brah.

Austen thinks about it for a while.

                            AUSTEN

               I didn't tell the pigs. Just

               (falters, then) . . . just

               Hugo up school.

Traffic SOUNDS ebb and die. History flows down to the sea.

                            AUSTEN

               Told because I was proud of ya

               brah. Massive proud.

Jaden looks at him. Proud of him? Fuck.

                            AUSTEN

               Couldn't help it.

Jaden has to hold on to the railings now.

                            AUSTEN

               What the pigs gonna do with ya?

54 | P a g e

Jaden looks around him. Darkness is falling.

Austen produces a gun from the base of his spine. His gun.

                            JADEN

               Where the fuck . . ?

He stares at Austen's gun. Tears blur the evening.

He says it with his tears. This isn't going to happen to you.

                            AUSTEN

               Only way you're gonna stop me

               turning into you is by killing

               me, brah. Long one short.

Austen holds his arms out as if to say `this is what I am'.

Jaden reaches for the base of his spine.

Austen stands there waiting for Jaden's bullet.

Jaden takes his hand away from his gun.

Jaden mumbles something inaudible.

                            AUSTEN

               Say what brah? Too much . . .

He indicates his ears, that wanking makes you deaf, laughs.

                             JADEN

                          (a mumble)

               Said go home. Fix dad's tea.

               I'll be there soon as. OK?

3.88 EXT. ROYAL VICTORIA DOCK  NIGHT, LATER

Jaden stands there alone. It's getting cold.

                           AUSTEN VO

                       (Jaden's memory)

               Only way you're gonna stop me

               turning into you is by killing

               me, brah.

                            JADEN

               Got a better idea, baby blood.

Jaden pulls out his gun and shoots himself in the head. Dead.

55 | P a g e

3.89 INT. E3 COUNCIL HOUSE  EVENING

In the kitchen-diner: Austen and Paul at the table.

Paul says a prayer before they eat their corner shop meal.

Austen's hands are together in respect for Paul.

But Paul can't speak. Austen sees his tears, which escape from

behind the barrier of his cracked hands like eager jewels.

Austen gets up and hugs his father with all his life.

3.90 INT. E3 COUNCIL HOUSE  EVENING

Not remotely resembling Jaden, Austen gets on with his

SUPER

                         `Mea Culpa'

Then:

FADE IN ON

4.91 INT. COUNTRY HOME  DAY

Apparently mild mannered URI (40s) writes on his desktop. He

is dressed like an accountant: conservative but efficient.

His blue stocking, home counties WIFE enters with a tray of

tea. She puts the tray down and passes Uri a cup of tea.

                             WIFE

               Won't be long.

Clicking off the Word Window on which he's working on his

computer quickly, he responds with a nondescript smile.

She kisses his forehead and exits the room.

Uri re-opens the Window on his computer. He looks out of the

window. Uri is living with something that can't be lived with.

He swigs from a bottle of JD that he retrieves from a drawer.

He turns back to the computer, reads what he's written.

                            URI VO

               But now the buck must stop.

               Exculpation is no longer

               an option. The state has

               lied to you, Mrs Pentane, and

               whatever the consequences, I

               feel it my duty to put the

               record straight. Why I feel

               thus obliged will become

               apparent should we meet. I

               leave that up to you.

4.92 INT. RESEARCH ROOM, FACILITY  DAY

Uri nods to moustachioed Thug#1, who is stretching as if he

has pulled a muscle. Shaved headed Thug#2 pulls a face.

57 | P a g e

                            THUG#2

               Get some deep heat on it.

                              URI

                         (frustrated)

               If we're kindly ready, Mister Tyne.

Uri then goes back to reading his novel.

Thug#2 almost smiles  almost. Not a face made for smiling.

Thug#1 works out the tension in the pulled muscle. He then

PUNCHES

NICHOLAS (30s)  a man tied naked to an old chair.

Nicholas is a mass of cuts, sores, burns and untreated wounds.

He is filthy and unshaven. He is delirious with agony.

Nicholas barely reacts to the blow  he's too far gone.

                             URI

               (without looking up from his book)

               Nicholas it's really so very

               simple.

Nicholas tries to open a swollen bloodshot eye. He can't.

Uri nods to Thug#1 again; but now Thug#1 pulls his blood

soiled rubber gloves off. He goes to put a new pair on.

Uri puts his book down and pulls an exasperated face.

Thug#2 steps in, hungry for exercise.

Thug#2 starts to beat Nicholas up. He has the powerful, fluid

movements of a prize fighter. He treats this as a workout.

Thug#1 looks outraged, as if this is against union rules.

Thug#2 works Nicholas expertly, and with professional care.

                             URI

               Alright, alright  thank you

               Mister Karaczun. This is . . .

This is getting them nowhere. Uri looks at Nicholas' pulped

face  at the new damage that Thug#2 has done. Pointless.

Thug#2 stands back, waits.

58 | P a g e

Uri stands, goes to a cabinet and pulls out a set of surgical

implements. He puts a pair of rubber sanitary gloves on. He

lays out the implements on a metal table beside Nicholas.

He goes to work.

4.93 INT. ARTIST STUDIO  DAY

ELLE (30's) draws a female nude in white pastel on black

paper. The drawing is as exquisite as she is, if that's

possible. Elle is the kind of woman that men will do anything

for - the kind of unforgettable beauty you see very rarely.

Elle takes extreme care with the drawing. Her attention to it

and involvement with it is absolute. She is alone in the

studio, which contains other drawings and simple furnature.

The SOUNDS of Uri torturing Nicholas OVER are in extreme,

hideous contrast to the beauty of Elle and her drawings.

The contours of Elle's face and the fine lines and moments of

shade in her drawing. The sounds of unimaginable suffering.

Five minutes of drawing. Five minutes of Nicholas' screams.

Then the SOUND of Uri dropping an implement and cursing.

The Thugs mumbling.

CUT TO BLACK

A heart PULSE falters, and then stops.

An electrocardiograph flat line SOUND.

A beat, then

UP ON

4.94 INT. RESEARCH ROOM, FACILITY  DAY

Uri stands back. There is blood all over his rubber gloves and

some on his apron. He looks at Nicholas, feels his pulse.

Nicholas is dead.

4.95 INT. BOARD ROOM, FACILITY - DAY

Uri sits at a huge, polished oak business meeting table. He is

now dressed in a business shirt, tie and three-piece suit. But

a louche handkerchief in his breast pocket adds a touch of

flare to his sombre ensemble. Uri is somewhat frustrated.

59 | P a g e

Three other suits are at the table: BOOTHY (50s), the boss,

SILK (40s), #2, and PARKER (30s), #3. All but Parker are

middle class and business-like. In here, PC efficiency is all.

                            BOOTHY

               Has the next of kin been

               informed?

Silk clears his throat.

                              SILK

               Not yet sir.

                            BOOTHY

                         (inform her)

               There's never a good time.

                              SILK

               Yes sir.

Silk makes a note on his iPad.

Boothy looks at Uri as if waiting for an explanation.

                             URI

               Our intelligence . . .

The irony of that comment creates a response that emanates

from Boothy and travels round the table hierarchically.

                            BOOTHY

               As the board understood it, the

               prisoner was verified as the

               jihadi. There was DNA. . .

                             URI

               We now believe the evidenced

               might have been contaminated.

                            BOOTHY

                       (not impressed)

               Was there any form of extraction?

                             URI

               The suspect revealed nothing of

               the activities of which he was

               suspected by the board, sir.

                            PARKER

               Fruit was not born.

60 | P a g e

The oddness of that causes some rolled eyes around the table.

                             URI

               It was a fruitless interrogation,

               sir - yes.

Boothy studies the information on his laptop. The others

therefore do the same. Uri smartens his suit and shirt cuffs.

Boothy eventually looks up from his laptop.

                            BOOTHY

               So not only do we have no further

               intel about the event, we

               have another next of kin, a

               nuclear bloody winter of media

               fallout and the inevitable

               Whitehall storm. We also have

               another body to . . .

                            PARKER

               Liquidate, sir?

Boothy ignores Parker almost entirely.

                            BOOTHY

                      (refers to laptop)

               It says here `The suspect did

               not respond to the usual stimuli.

               (at Uri) Stimuli? The usual . . .

                             URI

               We explored the usual routes

               in accordance with our mandate.

Boothy and Silk seem repulsed; Parker seems fascinated.

                             SILK

                         (to Boothy)

               If I may, sir. (to Uri) Perhaps

               he told you nothing because he

               knew nothing.

                             URI

               That's likely, yes.

                            BOOTHY

               Likely? Christ! This is the kind

               of thing the media gorges on

               for months! We can't . . .

61 | P a g e

                             URI

               There is no need.

Boothy looks at Uri. The others look at Uri.

                             URI

               Nicholas Pentane died while

               engaged in activities commensal

               with his profession as a

               freelance reporter from wounds

               sustained at the hands of

               insurgent personnel. He died

               behind enemy lines. He was

               transported home in a manner

               befitting a hero. He died

               while attempting to maintain

               the integrity and vibrancy of

               a free press  a press we all. . .

                            BOOTHY

               Spare me the party line, Uri,

               for God sake! This'll wiki

               itself sky high unless . . .

                             URI

               It's taken care of, sir.

They all look at him. The monster in their midst. Eventually:

                            BOOTHY

               We're getting off-message here.

                            PARKER

               Mission creep.

It should be funny but somehow it's sick.

                            BOOTHY

               What we're here to establish is

               how a freelance writer get's

               wrongly arrested, subjected to

               (makes quotation marks with his

               fingers) rendition and is then

               tortured by experts in the

               certainty that he is in fact

               a terrorist planning acts

               against the common good. On

               home soil against the Great

               British public et cetera.

               (beat) He was as innocent as

               any of us. Any answers, Uri?

62 | P a g e

Silence a beat, then:

                             URI

               Mistakes, happen, sir.

                            BOOTHY

               The man wrote a column for the

               Economist, for God sake!

Silence a beat, then:

                             URI

               The best moles have the best

               covers, sir. They simply

               always do.

Boothy looks at Uri in a particular way.

                            BOOTHY

               What we also need to establish

               is whether he was killed

               deliberately, or by . . .

4.96 INT. COUNTRY HOME  DAY

In his y-fronts only, Uri stands in his bathroom and scrubs

his hands manically in the sink. His hands are rubbed raw by

the scrubbing. He whimpers as he does this. His body shakes.

4.97 INT. BOARD ROOM, FACILITY - CONTINUOUS

                            PARKER

               Misadventure, sir?

Boothy glances at Parker. He doesn't need any help, thank you.

                             URI

               The human body can only take so

               much, sir. Subjected to a

               certain level of pressure it

               buckles. Nicholas Pentane's

               body simply broke under duress.

                             SILK

               The mind-body continuum.

                             URI

               The mind-body continuum.

Boothy reads something else on his laptop:

63 | P a g e

                            BOOTHY

               NP was arrested on the night of

               the fourth (reads more then)

               Transported under guard to

               the facility. Work began on

               the seventh to determine. . .

Boothy removes his glasses, looks at Uri.

                            BOOTHY

               So what was going on between

               the fourth and the seventh?

Uri clears his throat.

                             URI

               I was on holiday, sir.

                             SILK

               Ah. Anywhere nice?

                              URI

               Malaga again, sir. My wife does

               like it there.

                            BOOTHY

               Well not a bad choice at that

               time of year. We recommended

               that to do didn't we?

                              URI

               You did, sir, yes. Your wife

               actually sent us the brochure

               if you recall.

4.98 INT. ARTIST STUDIO  DAY

The phone rings. Elle leaves her drawing reluctantly, but then

smiles when she answers the phone. She misses her man!

                             ELLE

               Hello. (then, disappointed)

               Yes. (then, with dread) Yes.

                          BOOTHY VO

               We actually tried Corfu this

               year. Not bad  though it could

               have been warmer.

Elle listens to the caring sharing voice on the phone.

64 | P a g e

She listens, then puts her hand to her mouth. Her beautiful

eyes cloud with tears. She starts to buckle and sway. Then she

collapses. There's a certain grace to the way she does it.

                           SILK VO

               I can actually recommend Crete

               at this time of year. A bit

               populous, but there are places

               where one can escape the hordes.

Elle drops the phone.

4.99 INT. BOARD ROOM, FACILITY - CONTINUOUS

Boothy and Parker laugh at/with Silk. Uri's face is stone.

                            BOOTHY

               Oh Lord, Michael; if we left it

               to you we'll all be holidaying

               on the Norfolk Broads!

Silk pulls a `well actually' face. There is some laughter

until Boothy stops laughing and re-focusses on their agenda.

Boothy reads from his laptop again, then removes his glasses.

                            BOOTHY

               What we're left with is

               something of a mess. I'm sure

               you agree.

He looks at Uri and waits. The others do the same.

                             URI

               Sorry sir I don't suppose we

               could get some . . . I'm . . .

Uri makes a thirsty gesture. Mildly irritated, Boothy presses

a button on an intercom. It buzzes the other end, then

                            BOOTHY

                     (into the intercom)

               Sharon could we get some more

               coffee please. (to the others)

               Biscuits? (the others nod except

               Uri) And some biscuits. The

               usual. Actually if there are

               any chocolate digestives.

                          SHARON OS

                      (on the intercom)

               Certainly sir.

65 | P a g e

                            BOOTHY

                     (into the intercom)

               Thanks Sharon.

Boothy scratches his head, refocuses. Uri waits.

4.100 INT. COUNTRY HOME  DAY

Dressed like an accountant, Uri writes on his desktop.

                             URI

               My desire to meet with you

               arises from a strong urge to

               inform you of the circumstances

               under which your husband

               actually passed away. The fact

               is, Mrs Pentane, that you have

               certainly been misinformed.

Uri looks up, out of the window. He looks at his hands. They

seem so ordinary, so dull, and so average. He drinks more JD.

4.101 INT. BOARD ROOM, FACILITY - DAY

Uri accepts the coffee Sharon pours for them all. She puts a

plate of digestives down on the table and leaves the room.

                            BOOTHY

               Thanks Sharon.

Sharon smiles a response. She closes the door behind her.

Parker reaches out and grabs a digestive, which he eats.

                            PARKER

                         (mouth full)

               Never can resist the bloody

               things.

                            BOOTHY

                         (to Parker)

               Make yourself at home, minister.

Boothy and Silk grab a biscuit.

Uri sips his coffee. He REACTS.

The coffee is scalding. He has SCALDED his tongue.

                                URI

               Bloody hell!

SMASH CUT TO

4.102 INT. FACILITY  DAY (FLASHBACK)

In the last moments of his life, Nicholas screams and writhes

under the onslaught of agony delivered by Uri with his

surgical instruments. Nicholas is a pulped mess of blood.

4.103 INT. ELLE'S APARTMENT  NIGHT

Elle's face is contorted by grief. She is curled in the foetal

position on the floor. She weeps desperately. She staggers to

her feet. She goes to a built-in wardrobe. She opens his side

of it. His suits and shirts hang in quiet rows. She presses

into them, embraces them, sobbing and screaming her agony.

4.104 INT. COUNTRY HOME  DAY

Uri thinks a moment and then click `Send' with his mouse.

He takes a deep breath.

4.105 EXT. ELLE'S APARTMENT  DAY

Uri gets out of the taxi and pays the driver.

He then turns to face the address. He tries to move naturally,

but his body is stiff with misgiving. He takes a breath to try

to calm himself. He manages to walk to the front of the

apartment block. He starts to walk up the steps to the front

door; but then he retreats. He steps backwards, then begins to

walk away. He can't do it. His hands are shaking. He makes

fists to stop them. He takes another breath, looks up at the

apartment block. He is sick with stress. He forces his limbs

to obey him. He manages to walk back to the steps. He manages

to walk up the steps. Eventually he manages to press the

BUZZER

4.106 INT. ELLE'S APARTMENT  DAY, SAME TIME

Elle hears the door buzzer. She is pale and underweight.

She gets up, walks to the apartment door. She presses the

intercom button with trepidation. Her mouth is dry.

                                ELLE

               Yes?

The crackle of electric silence. Nothing.

67 | P a g e

Exasperated, she takes her finger off the button, turns away.

The buzzer sounds again.

Elle curses and turns back to it.

She hesitates, and then presses the answer button.

                             ELLE

               Hello?

                             URI

               Mrs Pentane? It's Uri Tallow

               from the ministry. We spoke

               earlier?

It's hard to do this. It takes everything that's left of her.

                             ELLE

               Ah  yes. Come in.

She presses the buzzer door release. The front door opening

sound, OS. Elle turns away from the door. She gathers herself.

She looks at her apartment door. She steps backwards from it,

as if dreading what might be approaching it. Eventually she is

in the middle of the large, open plan room staring at the

door. A shadow is visible under the door. A shape. A man. The

KNOCK

On her door makes her jump. She gathers herself.

She goes to the door. Eventually she opens it.

Uri stands there. He smiles thinly, extends a hand. As she

takes it he looks at his hand. This hand killed her love.

                             URI

               Mrs Pentane very good of you

               to see me like this.

                             ELLE

               Come in Mister Tallow.

She wants anything but this dull little man in her apartment.

Uri enters. He wipes his feet excessively, over and over.

She closes the door behind him. He looks around.

68 | P a g e

                             URI

               Lovely, just lovely. This is

               yours? Goodness.

He goes to a piece of art hanging on the wall. A nude.

                             URI

               It's amazing. Such talent. Me . . .

He shrugs as if worthless. Elle tries to hold it together.

                             ELLE

               Can I get you anything?

                             URI

               No  really I'm fine. Thank you.

He has trouble meeting her eyes. That unsettles her even more.

                             URI

               Such platitudes! Here we are

               trapped inside a Terrence

               Rattigan three act . . .

He laughs. It sounds unnatural.

Wary of him in the extreme, he gestures to a seat reluctantly.

She sits down opposite him. Her body language is pure defence.

                             URI

               Mrs Pentane. A delicate subject

               of course. Your husband.

She blinks. He can see the unimaginable depth of her grief.

Uri gets some correspondence out of his briefcase.

                             URI

               Good, old fashioned paper.

               Nothing like it.

He waves the sheets of paper around. She can't even react.

                             URI

               Firstly I'm so very sorry for

               your loss. I know the ministry

               has informed you that your

               husband  Mr Nicholas . . .

She puts her hand across her slightly swollen belly.

69 | P a g e

She's pregnant. My God. Uri frowns slightly, struggles.

                             URI

               Misses Pentane the fact is that . . .

She looks at him with exhausted, beautiful eyes.

                             URI

               The truth is Misses Pentane

               that . . . I'm here to tell you

               that . . . Well this may not

               be what you want to hear but . . .

He looks at her, looks away. He can't meet her gaze.

                             ELLE

                      (get the fuck out)

               If you'd kindly hurry. Please.

Her phone bleeps a message alert. An isolated sound.

                             URI

               Misses Pentane I . . .

He can't speak. Why did he come here? This is impossible.

                             URI

               Misses Pentane . . .

                             ELLE

               Oh for God sake!

She gets up, stands, walks away from him. He stands.

                             URI

               The fact is that your husband

               did not die in the manner in

               which you have been told he

               died. As I alluded in my

               letter, my email. . .

She opens the door for him to leave. He wants to die.

                             ELLE

               I can't do this now. I'm sorry.

He follows her to the door. His hands are shaking.

                              URI

               Misses Pentane please hear me.

               Why did I come here today?

               Well, the truth is I believe

               you should have the facts. The

               facts are that. . .we believe

               your husband was wrongfully

               arrested and . . .

She looks at him. No shit!

A family walking in the hall outside the door draw her

attention. A mother and her two sons. They smile at her.

She tries to smile, closes the door slightly.

Uri is almost hyperventilating by now.

                             ELLE

               You need to get the hell away

               from me. Sorry, but. . .

                             URI

               Misses Pentane the fact is that

               your husband was subjected to

               rendition. Not as you may have

               heard of it but in a form. . .

She has to lean against the wall.

                             URI

               Whilst in this instance your

               husband wasn't transported

               abroad because of logistics.

                                 ELLE

                             (a whisper)

               Logistics?

                             URI

               He was subjected here, in the

               United Kingdom to a process

               designed to get him to confess.

4.107 INT. BOARD ROOM, FACILITY - DAY

Uri feels his burnt tongue. Boothy, Silk and Parker observe.

                            BOOTHY

               What we need to establish, Uri,

               is whether, having found out

                            (more)

71 | P a g e

                           (cont'd)

               that you had made a mistake,

               you killed Nicholas Pentane

               deliberately, or whether his

               death was merely a product of

               of the processes to which he

               was being subjected.

                             URI

               He was no longer any use. By

               that stage his body was, his

               mind. . .He would never have

               been able to lead an ordinary

               life: work, have relationships.

                            BOOTHY

               So you did the judicious thing

               and disposed of the suspect

               accordingly?

4.108 INT. ELLE'S APARTMENT  DAY, SAME TIME

Elle stands by the door. She buckles. He wants to help her.

                             URI

               Your husband was tortured,

               Misses Pentane.

His voice has an unnatural edge to it. It sounds weird.

She starts to laugh hysterically. It's all a joke. Of course.

                             URI

               These are measures taken

               occasionally and in conditions

               of the utmost secrecy against

               certain suspects accused of

               terrorism  I'm sure you're aware.

She stops laughing.

She stares at him, tries to form words.

Her knees give out. He goes to her, helps her.

                             ELLE

               DON'T TOUCH ME!

She pushes him away in panic. He recoils.

72 | P a g e

                               ELLE

               Get out. Now.

Another text message bleeps ludicrously from her phone.

                             URI

               This isn't exactly what I came

               here to tell you, Misses . . .

               Not entirely. . .

She leans again the wall. He shuts the door softly.

He seems to reach a critical mass. Emotion leaves him.

                             URI

               What I came here to tell you

               today that it was me. I oversaw

               the torture and tortured your

               husband. It was under my

               ministrations . . .

She is incredulous of the use of the word.

                             URI

               It was me, you see. I killed

               him. An accident. Only so much.

Her world has become a nightmare. Nothing is real.

                             URI

               I know this is a lot to take

               in, Misses Pentane.

The words don't seem like hers:

                               ELLE

               What are you?

Uri almost smiles. Little old me.

As if in a dream she looks around, searching for something.

                             ELLE

               I'm calling the police.

                             URI

               That won't help much today.

But she dials. He grabs the phone from her with polite force.

He puts then phone down like a 5 star hotel receptionist.

73 | P a g e

                             ELLE

               What the fuck do you think. . .

               Get out  now!

She grabs the phone again and redials. He grabs the phone from

her, this time with slightly more force. She is pushed away.

                             ELLE

               Fucker! GET THE FUCK OUT!

But he just stands near her, breathing.

                             ELLE

               What do you want from me?

He opens his arms slightly, looks at her. The eyes of a child.

                             URI

               I want. I want. . .

He can't say it. Can't say forgiveness, can't say death.

She SUDDENLY grabs an ornament from the dresser near her.

                             URI

               Wait. Wait please.

He drops to his knees. Gets ready.

                              URI

               OK.

But she has swung and CONNECTED before he has spoken.

He reels from the impact, but she is weak with shock.

                             ELLE

               Piece of shit-mould. Get out. . .

She swings again  stronger this time. The blow hurts him.

                             ELLE

               This is what you fucking want?

               Fuck. . .(sobbing) Oh Jesus. . .

She changes. Adrenaline kicks in. She starts to pound him with

the ornament, which breaks. Then she grabs a stone stature and

HITS

Him with it. That sends him flying. He grovels on the carpet.

74 | P a g e

                             ELLE

               Motherfucker . . .

She lays into him. He accepts it all. Blow after bloody blow.

                             URI

               Yes (blow) Yes (blow) Yes (blow).

After a while she slows, exhausted.

                             ELLE

               Piece of dogshit . . .

She grabs her belly, grimaces. Uri's face is now pulped.

                             URI

               Misses Pentane . . . the

               exertion. Please . . .

He means her belly, her unborn child.

                             ELLE

               What? (incredulous) WHAT?

She is sobbing, broken, exhausted.

4.109 INT. BOARD ROOM, FACILITY - DAY

Uri looks at Booth, Silk and Parker. Coffee and digestives.

                             URI

               I relieved him of his pain.

4.110 INT. ELLE'S APARTMENT  DAY

Elle gasps for breath, stares at Uri through tears.

She drops the bloody stone statue. Uri is badly injured now.

                             ELLE

               Am I expected to admire . . .

               Leave me alone.

She tries to open the door, to haul him out.

                             URI

               It's OK. I don't want you to

               be . . . I'll make up a story.

               Don't worry. (beat) Actually

               I hate it all. (beat) I do as

               I'm told, actually. Sometimes . . .

75 | P a g e

She grabs the stone statue again and SWINGS.

Primal, she SCREAMS at him as she does it, and now the statue

CONNECTS

Uri is thrown sideways by the adrenal force of the blow.

He falls on the expensive carpet, barely conscious.

He glimpses a WHITE feather displayed as an ornament among

other artefacts in a lit, glass fronted display cabinet.

Elle drops the stone statue again, stumbles away.

                             ELLE

               Get out.

Uri begins to crawl towards the door. Leaves a trail of blood.

                             URI

               Don't worry. Mum's the word,

               Mrs Pentane. I'll take care of

               everything. Everything. I promise. . .

He reaches the door, grabs it with a bloody hand as we

CUT TO

4.111 INT. FACILITY  DAY

His face scarred, Uri sits among the instruments of torture.

Done thinking, he suddenly snaps his rubber gloves on.

Better get to it.

SUPER

                       `Jeremy Bentham'

FADE IN ON

5.112 EXT. SOUTH LONDON STREET  NIGHT

In urban winter darkness a hoodie walks down an alley. He uses

the deep shadows to conceal himself. He scopes out the back of

the houses he walks past, as if looking for an opportunity.

A radio advert ends OVER:

                            AD VO

               . . .not that you'll be needing

               one now that your house

               assurance is on the house. Cheers!

As the VO ends there is the sound of drinking glasses knocking

together in a busy pub, then an inane radio ad jingle, then:

5.113 INT. RADIO STATION  DJ BOOTH  NIGHT

                         FEMALE DJ VO

               So welcome back and if you've

               just joined us welcome: I'm

               talking to Chris Marlow, the

               barrister who represented

               decorated Afghanistan para

               veteran Shona Barnes earlier

               this year. If you recall, Shona

               was sentenced to seven years

               in Wormwood Scrubs for the

               murder of Caleb Rounds  the

               man who broke into her house,

               shot and held her hostage for

               several hours on the night of

               March the twelfth last year.

               Chris  so . . . in your

               opinion Shona's Post-Traumatic

               Stress Disorder, a condition

               she suffered following action. . .

               an incident with an IED in

               Helmand Province in Afghanistan

               in May two thousand and ten,

                            (more)

77 | P a g e

                           (cont'd)

               an incident that killed a

               close colleague of hers and

               resulted in Shona being

               pensioned, invalided out of

               the army. In your opinion Chris,

               this - the PTSD - should have

               been crucial to the decision

               not to prosecute Shona for

               murder, a charge you now feel

               should have been reduced to

               what: manslaughter? She didn't

               seem like much of an invalid

               in the way she dealt with Rounds

               did she? So for you - was this

               a travesty of justice? Really?

                          MARLOW VO

               My sense of it is, Christie,

               as I've said, and the reason I

               feel I failed, really, is that

               the state must find a way

               to take responsibility.

The hoodie climbs over the back fence of a house. He then

proceeds up the garden  again hugging the shadows for cover.

                         FEMALE DJ VO

               But now you're considering

               retiring? With a future as

               QC certain. A Law Lord perhaps.

               You're regarded by many as a

               (laughs) legal wunderkind!

                          MARLOW VO

               Well I don't know about that.

               But yes, I'm looking to move

               out of the legal profession now.

                         FEMALE DJ VO

               Because of this case, specifically?

               As Queens Council you could help

               people like Shona. Lots of Shonas.

                            MARLOW

               I know. But look. For me it's

               this: we send her out to

               Afghanistan. We tell her to kill

               people who resisted our invasion.

               (as the DJ starts to speak) But

                            (more)

78 | P a g e

                           (cont'd)

               anyway  look: we make her

               an expert. A killing machine.

               And then war breaks our machine.

               So then our machine needs

               Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder

               drugs in order to function in

               normal life. To make a cup of

               tea, for God sake. (silence a

               beat, then) She's a broken

               child, Chrissie. We broke her.

               So then when she kills a known

               psychotic child molester and

               murderer in her home in the

               middle of the night  in her

               home - in self-defence  we,

               the state, we call that murder,

               and we throw her to the dogs. We

               screw her up in the name of a

               cause in some country some

               people - and lets' face it,

               in a part of the world not

               many British people know or

               give a damn about - and then we

               finish the job. We prosecute her

               for murder and lock her up.

The hoodie chooses a ground floor window. He jemmies it open.

                         FEMALE DJ VO

               But ultimately the only

               alternative is that we don't

               have a professional, a standing

               army. We rely on . . .

                          MARLOW VO

               I understand. I understand

               that when you sign up, you

               take your chances. You become

               an organ of the state, and if

               that state tells you to kill

               people in its name, it chooses

               not to call that murder. It

               chooses then to call you a

               hero  especially if you die.

                         FEMALE DJ VO

               So these young people, the

               soldiers who give their lives

               in the defence of our liberty

               don't deserve the label hero.

               Is that what you're saying?

The hoodie climbs through the window he has jemmied open.

                          MARLOW VO

               Nation states have always

               protected themselves from their

               own imperial absurdities. What

               would be left if there was no

               chance of glory? Why would anyone

               sign up? Look: in war, anywhere,

               people do what they can to

               survive. All I can say is that

               personally, I mean as Shona's

               brief, I failed to make the court

               see sense. For me, you know, it's

               like you can murder in the so

               called defence of the state but

               if you kill in the defence of

               yourself . . .You know it's

               like, I mean as Shakespeare

               said `if his cause be wrong,

               our obedience to the king

               wipes the crime of it out of us.'

His voice dissolves and fades away as we

CUT TO

5.114 INT. SHONA'S HOME, BEDROOM  NIGHT

SHONA (20s, black) is awoken by a sound  the dull clunk of

something giving under strain. She lifts her head up, listens.

Another clunk, but this followed by other sounds downstairs.

Shona is quickly out of bed, standing. She moves in a way that

suggests combat training: with controlled power and assurance.

She is not afraid.

5.115 INT. SHONA'S HOME, KITCHEN - NIGHT

CALEB (20s, white) breaks in through the kitchen window. He's

young and hooded. His thin face is haunted by addiction.

Caleb climbs through the window he has just jemmied open. He

stands in the kitchen a moment, listening. He hears nothing.

80 | P a g e

He starts to move quietly through the kitchen towards the

5.116 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Caleb enters. He looks around, sees the usual living room

stuff: a settee, some ornaments, a TV and iPod and iPod dock;

a shelf bearing a few ornaments  OK, but Caleb wants more.

What Caleb doesn't seem to see are the mantelpiece photos of

Corporal Shona smiling with her Para mates in Afghanistan.

Caleb turns and heads towards the door. He goes out into the

5.117 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Caleb emerges from the living room.

CRACK

A fist connects with his jaw, sending him staggering.

CRACK, CRACK

Another two blows  a fist and a kick. Caleb sprawls, and then

manages to stand as Shona attacks him. She moves fast and with

focus  a shape in the darkness moving very fast. Caleb lashes

out with his right fist. He misses. She lands another two

punches to his neck and face. He yells and lashes out again.

This time he connects with the side of her head. She goes

sprawling. He dives towards her and pounds her with his fists.

                               CALEB

                  What the fuck  easy-peasy, ho!

She fights him: the focussed power of a trained soldier; but

he's too strong and doesn't seem to feel blows that should be

causing him a lot of pain. He PUNCHES her in the head twice.

She goes still.

Caleb now pulls the SILENCED GUN he's been trying to get his

hands on throughout the fight from his jacket pocket. He

stands, gasping for breath. He aims the gun at her.

                               CALEB

                  A bitch. I been had by a bitch!

                  (starts to laugh) Stand, bitch.

She just maintains her guard, balled up on the floor.

81 | P a g e

                            CALEB

               I said stand up. No way we're

               gonna have chats with you

               sprawled. Less you wanna fuck me

               now that is.

She looks up at him. Her evulsion is obvious.

He gestures up with the gun. Slowly, carefully, she stands.

                            CALEB

               Well shocky-shocky-shock. Wasn't

               expecting quite such a welcome.

Shona could be a statue.

                            CALEB

               What the fuck.

Caleb still points his gun at her. He looks at her. Nice.

                            CALEB

               It's Christmas, ho, ho, ho . . .

Keeping his gun on her, Caleb turns a lamp on. He sees her:

average height but athletic, powerful: attractive, damaged.

                            CALEB

               Way  ho. Choice. Smile for

               the camera. You got names?

He comes closer to her, examines her  but keeps his distance.

She seems calm, but he sees the storm beneath the surface.

                            CALEB

               All fucked up now ain't ya, babe.

               Who did this to ya?

All that moves is her eyes: she watches the gun  nothing

else. Caleb moves the gun deliberately, making her eyes move.

                            CALEB

               Notable: Lara fuckety Croft.

He moves the gun erratically. He can't outpace her eyes.

                            CALEB

                         (game over)

               Well shit, bitch: ain't you the

               self-same night owl. Name. I

               said what's your fuckin' name?

82 | P a g e

Still her eyes on the gun. Suddenly annoyed, he

LASHES OUT

He goes to hit her in the face with his gun but she ducks. He

swings at her again, and again she ducks. She assumes a combat

position: fists up, body ready again. She looks at his eyes.

                            CALEB

               Well ain't you the pocket

               battleship. We gonna have another

               swingers, you an' me? Don't

               think so, bitch. Think you an'

               me we gonna have chats, get

               under each other's skinny,

               maybe get some cosy. Howzat.

Fighting some inner battle, she just waits for his next move.

He's impressed, but suddenly he's bored by this game.

He aims the gun at her head.

                             CALEB

               OK. Let's play the you-kneeling

               -on-the-floor-now game. I liked

               you down there.

                      (she doesn't move)

               Yesterday, bitch.

He starts to squeeze the trigger. She doesn't move.

He aims the gun at her left shoulder and

SHOOTS HER

The bullet NICKS shoulder. It's just a flesh wound  but

enough to shut her up and make her drop to her knees in AGONY.

                            CALEB

               Now we got some kind of

               understanding. Some kind of

               parity goin' down. Name, ho.

He stands over her, looks down at the booty. She grabs her

left shoulder with her right hand and squeezes. The pain makes

her cry out, but she immediately bites her lip silent.

                             CALEB

               Well well. Now I'm more than

                            (more)

83 | P a g e

                           (cont'd)

               somewhat. Don't know that I

               could take one like that.

He looks away from her, sees the photographs on the mantle:

Shona the soldier with her squaddie buddies in Afghanistan.

                            CALEB

               Well that explains. A bona fide

               fuckin hero. Heroine. Which

               makes me wonder, actually:

               where's your stash? The gear?

He looks at her, waits. She grimaces in controlled agony.

                            CALEB

               Don't make me spell it out. You

               know why we in `ere `aving this.

Losing it, he suddenly goes to her, grabs her and drags her to

the settee. He throws her on it. The pain makes her wince. She

muffles her scream with pride. She now knows he is psychotic.

                            CALEB

               DON'T PLAY ME, BITCH. Where's

               your fuckin' gear. Everybody

               got gear round this green

               and pleasant land.

He points his gun at her head. She shakes her head no.

                            CALEB

               What the fuck. You the only

               bitch I picked in this whole

               postie with no gear? Fuck.

               Trust Caleb to pick a soldier.

He glances at the photographs again, grins.

                            CALEB

               You got that uniform still? I

               like a woman in uniform.

She just looks at him through the fog of bloody agony.

                            CALEB

               How come you so hot, babes?

               You leave the central heating

               on all night to keep you snuggles?

               Nothing like a man for that.

84 | P a g e

He removes his jacket, and then the hoodie he wears beneath

it. She can see his prison tats and scars on his neck. She can

see the injection marks on his dirty, skinny forearms.

                            CALEB

               Hey  what you lookin' at?

               Look at me. At me eyes, ho.

She won't meet his eyes. ON her eyes in ECU:

The SOUNDS of war until

                            CALEB

               I said look at me you fuckin' . . .

He jabs the gun into her crotch, leans close to her.

She looks him in the eyes. She sees everything that's wrong.

                            CALEB

               You know what I am  huh? You

               know what I am, really? (leans

               close, looks deep into her eyes)

               I'm hungry. Starved. (stands up,

               moves towards the door) Wot you

               gonna give Caleb tweet  apart

               from laters?

He grins, looks at her crotch and licks his lips.

Her eyes are glass. She closes them to make it all go away.

                              CALEB

               Hey    no: none of that. You stay

               front   and fucking centre. On the

               ball.   Keep your soldier eyes

               on me   no matter what. Hear me?

She opens her eyes. The SOUNDS of war. Her war. Her hell.

                            CALEB

               That's better, soldier soldier.

               Now don't be going for no

               walkies  `kay?

Backing towards the door he looks and points his gun at her.

                            CALEB

               Not a muscle, ho. You stay

               like a good doggie  period.

85 | P a g e

He doesn't trust her, but he's going to take a chance.

He heads out of the room quickly and goes into the

5.118 INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Caleb goes through cupboards - fast.

                             CALEB

               Not a move, babes. I'm watching.

                     (searches cupboards)

               Where you keep the cake, ho?

               Me and Victoria sponge, we're

               tight as a schoolgirl's twat.

Going from cupboard to cupboard, he sees the usual food and

crockery etc. In one cupboard he sees bottle of prescription

pills: benzodiazepine, diazepam, and methylphenidate.

                            CALEB

                       (a low whistle)

               And I thought I was fucked up.

               What they do to you out there,

               babes? Turn you into a raghead?

He grabs a bottle of benzodiazepine and goes back into the

5.119 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Reading the bottle label he doesn't notice that she has gone

for a brief moment. But when he does, he throws the bottle

aside and starts moving. He runs out of the room and heads

5.120 INT. UPSTAIRS - NIGHT

Caleb runs up the stairs onto the landing, his gun up.

                            CALEB

               Hey  fuck, bitch. Hey!

He hears a noise from the

5.121 INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

He runs in, sees her trying to make a call on her mobile. With

his peripheral vision and for the briefest moment he sees a

WHITE feather on the dresser beside her bed. Without stopping

he rushes her, as she desperately thumbs the buttons. He

SMASHES the phone from her hand and shoves her. But she

manages to keep on her feet and run out of the room. He

86 | P a g e

SHOOTS

The bullet THUDS into the wall by her as she sprints onto the

5.122 INT. LANDING - NIGHT

Shona emerges from the bedroom and rushes down the stairs, her

left hand holding her wounded and bleeding right shoulder.

                            CALEB

               Come here you fuckin' slag . . .

Caleb runs down the stairs after her.

DOWNSTAIRS

Shona sprints full speed into the

5.123 INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

She goes to a drawer, rips it open. She grabs a knife and

turns to face him just as he reaches her. His face contorted,

he CRAMS his gun into her face as she SLASHES at him

CUTTING HIM

Caleb staggers backwards, his face pouring blood.

                            CALEB

               Fucking slippery bitch! SHIT!

Caleb points the gun at her. She freezes. He indicates drop

the knife with the gun while he holds his cut, bleeding face.

She puts the knife down. Her eyes never leave his gun.

                            CALEB

               You stupid fucking slut! Jesus!

Shocked by the CUT on his face he aims his gun at her head.

                             SHONA

               Do it.

                             CALEB

               She speaks.

She means shoot her.

                            SHONA

               Go for it. Serious.

87 | P a g e

                             CALEB

                Don't fuckin' tempt me.

His finger squeezes the

TRIGGER

Tighter and tighter. The trigger starts to move. But then she

SMILES AT HIM

He stops, thrown by her smile.

                             CALEB

                What the fuck? No one smiles

                at Caleb.

She still smiles at him.

                             CALEB

                Stop. (spells) D-O-N-T. I said. . .

He shoves the gun at her. But she keeps smiling. Bizarre.

                              CALEB

                           (panicked)

                Stop. Fucking don't smile. `Kay?

But she won't stop. He lunges at her, swipes with the gun.

She lashes out at him with her fist  HITS his face.

He staggers backwards. He's had enough.

He aims the gun at her head again, sure and steady.

                             CALEB

                Your choice, bitch.

She stops smiling.

                             SHONA

                Wrong.

She drops her guard, stands very still, waiting. The bleeding

gunshot wound in her shoulder is draining the life from her.

They look at each other a moment, breathing hard.

She looks away from him, disgusted.

88 | P a g e

                             CALEB

               That's what I thought. (beat)

               OK. So now what we gonna do is

               you gonna make me a sarnie. Go.

                      (she doesn't move)

               Go!

She holds his eyes defiantly, and then she moves.

5.124 INT. KITCHEN  LATER, NIGHT

Caleb eats a cheese sandwich. His gun is on the kitchen table

near his right hand. Shona sits opposite him; she's in bad

shape: he shoulder wound is pulling her down fast. She holds a

kitchen towel against it, which is SOAKED in dark red blood.

Caleb watches her.

                            CALEB

               Solider girl needs a hospital.

He eats a while. She won't even look at him.

                            CALEB

               So what's with all the shit?

               (indicates the cupboard with

               the drugs in it) They fuck you

               up in ragland or something?

               Wonder why you can't lead a normal

               fuckin' life? Wankers. You do

               what they tell ya an' you're

               all cool, babes. Do what you

               wanna do an' you're . . .

               (pulls his finger across his

               throat) You decorated and all

               that? I should be scared.

               (laughs) If you just knew what

               Caleb has done. Bad things,

               babes, worse than bad. Then

               you'd be scared, trust.

He eats, watches her, and waits.

                            SHONA

               What do you want?

                            CALEB

               What you think I fuckin' want?

               A teensy weensy respect would

               be nice. Failing that, this

               sarnie is really rather nice, ta.

89 | P a g e

He eats, watches her, and waits. She's bleeding to death.

She closes her eyes.

ON Shona: SOUNDS of an explosion, shouting, and Shona

screaming `Sandy!' followed by automatic weapons firing.

This BUILDS until Shona's eyes suddenly OPEN.

                             SHONA

                       (strangely calm)

               I need a doctor.

He breaks down in a fit of laughter.

                            CALEB

               She needs a doctor. Well you

               might yet, babes. We not done

               partying yet. Then maybe you

               need a doctor. First. . .

He finishes the sandwich, wipes his hands on the chair.

He looks at her body.

                            CALEB

               First I'm going to see what's

               what (indicates the house, her

               possession). Then we gonna see

               what's what (looks at her body

               suggestively). Ain't never done

               black, but there's always a first

               time  no? Say there's no goin'

               back. That right?

He laughs again, and then suddenly goes very serious.

                            CALEB

               You wan' it first, or you wanna

               sit tight while I go foray,

               then we get acquainted?

She fights for control. She's losing the battle.

Caleb suddenly stands, pushing the chair back. The sudden

SOUND of the chair scraping on the floor makes her start.

                            CALEB

               Oh for fuck's sake.

He goes to the medicine cupboard, gets her drugs out.

90 | P a g e

                            CALEB

               What do ya need?

He grabs various drugs and dumps them on the table in front of

her. Then fills a glass with tap water and gives her that.

                            CALEB

               Get fixed up, babes, I ain't

               got all night.

She doesn't move.

Irritated, he pours DOZENS of pills from various bottles out,

savagely, and CRAMS them into her mouth. He then forces the

glass of water to her lips and makes her take the pills.

She gasps for air. He stands over her.

                            CALEB

               She swallows. He knew she would.

                            SHONA

               You have to go now.

                            CALEB

               Fuckin' what? (laughs) Fuckin'

               what? I'll leave when it's time

               to leave, babes. First is you

               gonna show me some hospitable

               time  just the two of us. The

               shit (her belongings) can wait.

He goes round the table to her. The drugs start to hit her:

she fights them. She's shaking and sweating with pain from her

wounded shoulder. He caresses her cheek with his gun.

                            CALEB

               Babes  come on. We can be

               fuck buddies or whatever.

                            SHONA

               Friends with benefits. Yeah.

                            CALEB

               Friends with benefits. Gotcha.

               You watch all the right shows.

               No strings, no comebacks. So

               the things is: however we do

               it, Caleb's getting' horny, so . . .

He grabs her right hand and puts it on his crotch.

91 | P a g e

The drug OD begins to win the war inside Shona.

                            CALEB

               Slow and steady wins the race,

               babes. We take it easy steps.

               That's right  beautiful. . .

She jerks her hand away. It has to be now.

                            SHONA

               Get the fuck out of my house.

                             CALEB

               Say what?

He GRABS her by the hair, starts forcing her head towards his

crotch. With his gun hand he starts to unzip his fly.

                            CALEB

               An' me been so fuckin' la-de-

               dah with ya, and now this.

               Do what Caleb says, bitch, an'

               do it NOW . . .

As he goes to pull his pecker out she stands. As if she's had

enough of the game, she looks at him like a bug, dead already.

                            CALEB

               Sit the fuck . . .

Lightning fast, she POUNDS her index and first fingers into

his EYES, blinding him. At the same time she snap PUNCHES his

THROAT, collapsing his oesophagus completely. In less than a

second, Caleb goes from being in charge to being a grovelling,

screaming piece of crap on the floor at her feet. But now he

FIRES

His gun wildly up at her  anywhere. Succumbing to the drugs

she dodges as the bullets THUD into the walls and furnature.

                            SHONA

               Stop! Please . . .

She KICKS at his gun hand. It's inaccurate because now the

drugs are overwhelming her. He keeps hold of the gun 

screaming and gasping for breath he will never draw again.

A bullet SLAMS into the wall beside her. Reluctantly she

Forces herself to FOCUS, to hold the drugs back as she

92 | P a g e

SMASHES

The back of his neck with the side of her fist. A loud

CRACK

Caleb stops moving, instantly DEAD.

Shona stands there breathing hard, trying to focus.

And then, slowly, surely the tears come. The drugs win.

A radio ad, OVER

                            AD VO #1

                             (male)

                I should cocoa, Betty.

                            AD VO #2

                            (female)

                Me too, Bill. Nighty-night. . .

The sounds of polite kissing and an inane radio ad jingle as

Shona collapses. As she loses consciousness, BLACKNESS and

the SOUND of distant, hallucinatory police SIRENS as we

DISSOLVE TO

5.125 INT. POLICE HOLDING CELL  DAY

The radio ad jingle and bullshit fades to SILENCE as

A year later: Shona sits looking at CAMERA. She is handcuffed.

Her face bears the scars. Her eyes in ECU: they are dark,

damaged, strong and sad. She is searching for our affirmation.

Slowly, surely we

FADE TO BLACK
