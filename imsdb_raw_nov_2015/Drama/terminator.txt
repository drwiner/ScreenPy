1       EXT. SCHOOLYARD - NIGHT                                1

        Silence.  Gradually the sound of distant traffic becomes

        audible.  A LOW ANGLE bounded on one side by a chain-link

        fence and on the other by the one-story public school build-

        ings.  Spray-can hieroglyphics and distant streetlight sha-

        dows.  This is a Los Angeles public school in a blue collar

        neighborhood.

        ANGLE BETWEEN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, where a trash dumpster looms

        in a LOW ANGLE, part of the clutter behind the gymnasium.

        A CAT enters FRAME.  CAMERA DOLLIES FORWARD, prowling with

        him through the landscape of trash receptacles and shadows.

        CLOSE ON CAT, which freezes, alert, sensing something just

        beyond human perception.

        A sourceless wind rises, and with it a keening WHINE.

        Papers blow across the pavement.

        The cat YOWLS and hides under the dumpster.

        Windows rattle in their frames.

        The WHINE intensifies, accompanied now by a wash of frigid

        PURPLE LIGHT.  A CONCUSSION like a thunderclap right over-

        head blows in all the windows facing the yard.

        C.U. - CAT, its eyes are wide as the glare dies.

1A/FX   ANGLE - DUMPSTER                                       1A/FX

        ELECTRICAL DISCHARGES arc from the dumpster to a water

        faucet and climb a drain pipe like a Jacob's Ladder.

2       EXT. SCHOOLYARD - NIGHT                                2

        SLOW PAN as the sound of stray electrical CRACKLING subsides.

        FRAME comes to rest on the figure of a NAKED MAN kneeling,

        faced away, in the previously empty yard.

        He stands, slowly.

        The man is in his late thirties, tall and powerfully built,

        moving with graceful precision.

        C.U. - MAN, his facial features reiterate the power of his

        body and are dominated by the eyes, which are intense, blue

        and depthless.  His hair is military short.

        This man is the TERMINATOR.

        He glances down, taking calm inventory of himself, and

        notices that a fine white ash covers his skin.  He brushes

        at it unconcernedly as he walks toward the fence, scanning

        his surroundings.

                                              CUT TO:

2A/FX   CRANE SHOT - SCHOOLYARD/CITY - NIGHT                   2A/FX

        CAMERA MOVES UP as Terminator approaches the schoolyard fence

        beyond which is an embankment rolling down in darkness to the

        cityscape below.  The school is perched at the edge of a pro-

        montory offering a respectable view of the urban sprawl teem-

        ing and glistening under a sullen sky.  The night clouds are

        shot through with occasional flashes of LIGHTNING, presaging

        a thunderstorm.

        Terminator stands, hands on hips in prefect symmetry, gazing

        down at the city as the CAMERA REACHES FULL HEIGHT.

                                              CUT TO:

3       EXT. PLAYGROUND - NIGHT                               3

        A beer bottle SMASHES on the ground.  PULL BACK to include

        its ex-owner and his two compatriots, YOUTH GANG MEMBERS,

        lounging on the jungle gym of a deserted playground.  They

        sport nondescript PUNK REGALIA...torn T-shirts, fatigue

        pants, combat boots or high-top sneakers, leather jackets.

        The leader notices something and sits up.

                                LEADER

                           (pointing)

                     Hey, hey...what's wrong with

                     this picture?

        ANGLE - REVERSE, seen past the lounging toughs, Terminator

        walks naked into a pool of streetlight, striding purpose-

        fully toward them.

        ANGLE - OVER TERMINATOR'S SHOULDER, as he approaches them.

        They slide from their perches and drop easily to the ground

        liquid shadows.

                                LEADER

                     Nice night for a walk, eh?

        Terminator stops right in front of them.

                                TERMINATOR

                           (without inflec-

                           tion)

                      Nice night for a walk.

        They surround him, all swagger and malign good humor.

                                SECOND PUNK

                      Washday tomorrow, huh?  Nothing

                      clean, right?

        Terminator eyes them without expression, unhurried.

        Reptilian.

                                TERMINATOR

                      Nothing clean.  Right.

                                LEADER

                      This guy's a couple bricks

                      short.

        Terminator turn to the second punk, ignoring the

        others.

                                TERMINATOR

                      Your clothes.  Give them to me.

        The punks exchange glances, dismayed.

                                TERMINATOR

                           (coldly)

                      Now.

                                SECOND PUNK

                           (bracing)

                      Fuck you, asshole.

        Without warning Terminator hammer-punches him in the temple

        with blinding speed.  The blow flings him with a CLANG into

        the jungle gym.  He drops to the ground in a still heap,

        eyes open, twitching.

        The leader whips out his SWITCHBLADE and slashes in one

        motion.  Terminator ducks back and catches the knife-

        wielder's wrist in an inhuman grip.  Then he punches the

        leader with piledriver force just below the breastbone.

        ANGLE - PAVEMENT, as the knife clatters down.  The punk's

        combat boots are on tiptoe, barely touching the ground.

        ANGLE - TWO SHOT, Terminator and the leader are close

        together as if dancing, but motionless.  Their bodies are in

        total shadow.  The punk's eyes are wide, his veins distended

        with an agonizing pressure.  Terminator jerks his fist back

        with a WET SOUND and the other drops OUT OF FRAME.

        The last tough is stumbling away, gaping with terror.  He

        backs into a chainlink fence, turns to run along it, finds

        he is in a corner.

        Terminator takes a step toward him, his gaze ominous.

        The punk begins shakily stripping off his clothes.

        Thunder peals overhead.

                                               CUT TO:

4       EXT. STREET/NEARBY - NIGHT                             4

        A light RAIN begins to fall.

        Terminator emerges onto the street from the playground,

        pausing in the pool of light under a streetlight to hike

        the collar of the punk's jacket.

               The rain streams down over his face, running into

        and over his eyes.  They do not blink.

                                               CUT TO:

5       EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET/ALLEY - NIGHT                     5

        Another part of the city.  Seedy apartments and storefronts.

        The streets glisten, hissing with sporadic late night traffic.

        SLOW PAN AND DOLLY into the mouth of a narrow alley lined

        with trash containers and fire escapes.  From a recessed

        doorway, two filthy legs sprawl out onto the wet pavement.

        An angry, inarticulate DRUNKARD'S MONOLOGUE rises occasionally

        above the rain sounds.

        ANGLE - DOORWAY,  The derelict rouses from his bitter stupor

        as a brilliant purple glare lights up the wet brickwork

        around him.  A shockwave hurls trash into the air.

        Painted over windows shatter.

        Rat scurry, blinded.

        A FIGURE drops INTO FRAME as if out of the sky and smacks

        the pavement with a muddy splash.

        C.U. - DERELICT, as he blinks at the fading glare, amazed.

        A NAKED MAN, compact and muscular, rises in a defensive

        crouch.  KYLE REESE is 22, but his face has been aged by

        ordeal, the mouth hard, eyes grim.  A crinkled burn scar

        traverses one side of his face from chin to forehead.  Other

        scars, from burns and bullets, mar his hard-muscled body.

        The rain washes a fine coating of white ash from his skin

        as electrical ARCS lace back and forth between the fire

        escapes behind him, HISSING and SPUTTERING.  The sound

        fades, then stops altogether, to be replaced by a rising

        scream of animal agony.

        Reese lurches to his feet and sprints across the alley.

                                               CUT TO:

5A/FX   OMITTED                                                5A/FX

7       EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT                               7

        CAMERA MOVES WITH REESE as he leaps to the fire escape and

        clambers up to the first landing to crouch beside another

        NAKED MAN who appears to be entangled in the ironwork.  The

        man is contorted with pain as his screams die to a shivering

        gasp.  CLOSER ANGLE reveals that he has been skewered through

        the abdomen by the horizontal iron slats and through the

        shoulder by a railing.  He has materialized in the same

        space occupied by the fire escape structure.  The figure

        slumps, motionless.

        Reese quickly checks for signs of life.  The man is dead.

        Reese descend to the alley floor and crosses to the drunk

        huddled in the doorway.

        A pair of flamboyantly dressed women, obviously working

        girls, passes by the alley mouth.  They do a double take

        when they see Reese, but walk on without breaking stride,

        completely jaded.  He's certainly not a potential customer.

        Reese crouches down as if to speak to the drunk.

                                DERELICT

                      Say, buddy...did you see a

                      real bright light?

                                               CUT TO:

8       EXT. ALLEY/SAME - NIGHT                                8

        A brilliant white glare stabs into the alley mouth as an

        LAPD cruiser glides slowly by on the street.  The search-

        light illuminates the figure of Reese, crouching over the

        sprawled drunk, just pulling on the other's trousers.

        The cruiser chirps to a stop.  The doors fly open and two

        cops leap out.

                                FIRST COP

                      Hold it, right there!

        Reese hitches his pants and bolt like a shot.  The cops

        draw their guns and race into the alley after him.

        HANDHELD CAMERA or PANAGLIDE, rushing with Reese along the

        narrow alley.  He vaults a pile of tumbled trashcans.

        Whips around a corner.  Leaps the hood of a parked car in

        the cross alley.

        PANAGLIDE PRECEDING COPS, as they snake through the night

        maze.

                                               CUT TO:

9       EXT. CROSS ALLEY - NIGHT                               9

        PANAGLIDE WITH REESE as he hits a chain link gate at a

        dead run and scrambles over it.

10      EXT. ALLEY JUNCTION - NIGHT                            10

        WHIP PAN ON COPS, skidding to a stop at the corner in time

        to see Reese vault the fence.  They separate.

        DOLLY WITH SECOND COP, as he runs to the gate.

                                               CUT TO:

11      EXT. ALLEY/NEARBY - NIGHT                              11

        LOW PANAGLIDE WITH REESE, running full tilt, displaying

        incredible agility.

        REESE'S POV, the alley walls blur by.  The view of a hot-

        wired rat in an urban maze.

        C.U. - REESE, CAMERA hugging him as he sprints and turns,

        alternately front-lit, side-lit and silhouetted as the

        electric glare of the city wheels about him.

        ANGLE - ALLEY MOUTH, Reese flashes though intermittent

        cross-lighting in the B.G.

        Another unit arrives out front and Reese melts back into

        the alley, only to see a cop round the corner behind him.

        Sandwiched.  Reese crashes into a steel door, rending the

        lock, and vanishes into the darkness within.

        The newly arrived cops are a K-9 unit.  They open the back

        door of the squad car to release a large black Doberman.

                                               CUT TO:

12      INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT                          12

        Reese finds himself among the display racks of a discount

        department store.  A searchlight stabs in the front

        window as he dashes into the maze of aisles.

        Three cops enter behind him through the shattered door.

        FAST PANAGLIDE WITH REESE, as he crab-runs low among the

        moving shadows where flashlights quarter the darkness.  He

        bolts the open space behind a display window.  Sees the

        outside searchlight sweep toward him.  Freezes.

        ANGLE - REESE, his feral face frozen among the smooth-

        featured, smiling mannequins.  As the light passes, Reese

        silently moves on.

        ANGLE - COP, passing the end of a long aisle B.G. while in

        the F.G. a hand ENTERS FRAME, removing a knit shirt from a

        hanger.  Reese slips the shirt on quietly and does a fast

        crab-walk across the aisles to melt into the other racks

        and shadows, CAMERA MOVING LOW with him.

                                               CUT TO:

13      INT. DEPARTMENT STORE/AISLE - NIGHT                    13

        With a shocking GROWL the police dog hurtles out of the

        shadows, LEAPING RIGHT AT CAMERA.

        ANGLE - REESE AND DOG, a dark blur with teeth, extremely

        Doberman, flies toward Reese.  He spins.  Catches it by

        the throat in mid-air. Arcs it to the floor with unflinching

        precision.

        C.U. - DOBERMAN, suddenly on its back and held by the throat,

        THE DOG YELPS and stares at Reese, who leans very close.

        Inches from its eyes he fixes it with a gaze of uncompromis-

        ing dominance.  Some ancient communication seems to pass

        between the two.

        Reese releases the animal and turns his back on it, selecting

        a long overcoat from a rack.  The dog backs away from him,

        stiff-legged and confused.

                                               CUT TO:

14      INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT                          14

        TRACKING WITH REESE as he rounds a corner on the run, still

        shrugging into his long coat.

        Running smack at him is another cop, gun aimed.

        Without slowing, Reese leaps toward him, twisting in mid-air

        like a cat.  The cop FIRES. Misses.  Goes down under Reese's

        tackle and they slide together on the polished floor.

        Before they even come to rest Reese snatches the cop's gun,

        aiming it at the other's face two-handed.

                                REESE

                      What day is it?  The date...

                                COP

                      Thursday...uh...May twelfth.

                                REESE

                           (viciously)

                      What year?

        A SHOT whines off the metal side of an escalator behind

        Reese's head.  He vaults the escalator rail, leaving the

        amazed cop lying on the floor.

        Reese bounds up the frozen steps, pocketing the .38 Police

        Special in his coat.

        Cops dash through the maze of aisles, converging at the

        escalators.

                                               CUT TO:

15      INT. DEPARTMENT STORE/SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT             15

        WHIP PANNING WITH REESE, as he hurtles between displays.

        He stops for a moment beside a rack of shoes.  Slaps one of

        a pair of tennis shoes sole-to-sole against his bare foot.

        Too small.  Another.  Holding the shoes he runs on.

                                               CUT TO:

16      EXT. SECOND FLOOR FIRE ESCAPE LANDING - NIGHT          16

        A door opens quietly and Reese slips out.

        CAMERA TRACKS WITH HIM as he moves like a panther along the

        narrow catwalk.  TILT DOWN to include the first LAPD cruiser

        parked at the mouth of the alley.

                                               CUT TO:

17      EXT. ALLEY/STREET - NIGHT                              17

        Reese drops cat-like beside the unattended police car.

        Cautiously, he opens the door of the cruiser, removes the

        RIOT GUN, an Ithaca pump model, from the dash rack and slips

        it under his coat.  Cradled in a vertical position, the

        shortened weapon is virtually invisible.

        He walks out onto the street and away,  unhurriedly, an

        innocuous pedestrian soon lost in the rain.

                                               CUT TO:

18      EXT. STREET/NEARBY - NIGHT                             18

        Reese enters a telephone booth.  Harsh light rakes across

        his face, outlining the long scar.  He opens the directory,

        leafs through it.

        ANGLE - MACRO ON PAGE, Reese's finger slides down a column.

        Stops beside the following listings in the big metropolitan

        white pages:

        CONNOR, SARAH

        CONNOR, SARAH ANN

        CONNOR, SARAH J.

        The night's rain has given way to a typical L.A. morning

        of diffuse sunlight.

        MOVING WITH A GIRL on a MOPED as she zips through traffic.

        SARAH CONNER is 19, small and delicate-featured.  Pretty in

        a flawed, accessible way. She doesn't stop the party when

        she walks in, but you'd like to get to know her.  Her vulner-

        able quality masks a strength even she doesn't know exists.

        Sarah maneuvers nimbly, apparently in a hurry.

        Sarah buzzes into the parking lot of Big Bob's Family

        Restaurant and chains the moped to the icon of Big Bob

        himself.  The fiberglass cherub holds up his mammoth

        hamburger in perpetual homage to whatever deity watches

        out for fat kids.

        Sarah removes a stack of college textbooks from the luggage

        carrier and tuns to go into the restaurant.

                                SARAH

                           (to Big Bob)

        The office is closet-like, lit by the glow of several

        security monitors.  CHUCK BREEN, day manager, pimply and

        officious,watches Sarah in an overhead view of the service

        corridor.  He punches a switch and reaches for a microphone

        on a studio gooseneck.

                                BREEN (V.O.)

                      Sarah?

        She answers the empty hallway.

                                SARAH

                      Yes, Chuck?

        She turns back toward the office door at the end of the

        corridor.

                           up)

                      You're late.

        Sarah is undaunted.

                                SARAH

                      Aren't I worth waiting for?

                                BREEN

                      Not really.  Do you think you

                      can get here on time if I put

                      you on the floor as a waitress?

                                SARAH

                           (grinning)

                      I don't know.  I kinda had

                      my heart set on being a

                      cashier the rest of my life.

                                BREEN

                      The pay's the same but you'll

                      make more in tips.

                                SARAH

                      Thanks, Chuck.  I need the

                      money.  Can I still work the

                      hours around my classes?

        Breen turns to punch up a display on the restaurant's

        small accounting computer.  Sarah looks over his shoulder

        as he modifies the week's schedule.

                                BREEN

                      Mmm.  Same schedule's okay.

                                SARAH

                      Alright!

                                BREEN

                           (gravely)

                      Can you handle it?

                                SARAH

                      It's not brain surgery,

                      Chuck.

        Breen hands her an apron ceremoniously.

                                BREEN

                      Here you go.  You're a

        White blouse.  Short flared skirt and apron with a bow.

        She resembles a suburbanized peasant maid looking for a

        Sarah confronts her reflection in the mirror, pondering

        its absurdity.

        She pinches her sheeks.

        Smiles vacuously.

        the ignition assembly and strips the wires with a brutal

        Terminator passes the appliance section, and the pictures

        on a row of TV sets distort and break-up sequentially as

        he walks by, returning to normal behind him.

        He enters the store.

        back as he steps in to take the man's place.

        Sarah is bustling about, trying to service the start of

        the dinner rush.  In waitress parlance, she's 'in it'.

        She runs the gauntlet between tables, precariously balancing

        two full dinner plates on one arm and hand-carrying a

        third.  A customer tugs on her apron for attention and she

        barely averts contributing the chili size to his wardrobe.

        She gasps and stops in her tracks as Terminator smoothly

        pulls the .45 from under his jacket and snaps the cocking

        slide.

        WRONG SARAH CONNOR.  ELECTRODE PADS exercise her doughy

        thighs as the 35 year old divorcee watches "GENERAL HOSPITAL".

        She calls out distractedly:

                      What is it, Mom?

        She jumps as the door BANGS open.  And stares in dumb

        amazement as the good-looking, intense-eyed man in the

        strange clothes raises a pistol.

        And aims it at her face.

        It all seems less real than "GENERAL HOSPITAL" in that

        half-second before he FIRES.

        the SHOT.  The silence stretches for several BEATS.  Then

        FIVE MORE SHOTS are heard.

        The woman screams and drops the phone as she stares upward.

        ANGLE ON CEILING above her.  With each successive shot a

        chuck of plaster explodes off the ceiling.

        down at the dead woman, just OUT OF FRAME on the floor.

        He unhurriedly removes the spent clip, reloads the weapon

        and replaces it under his jacket.

        Crouching down, he turns the woman's body over, confirming

        that she is dead.

        door open.

        Terminator stands at the head of the stairs.

        His hand is bloody where he grasped the dead woman's

        shoulder.

        He starts down the stairs.

        The mother stands paralyzed, unable to breathe.

        He reaches the main floor and walks toward her.

        She edges into a corner, eyes wide.

        He reaches out.

        And wipes his hands clean on her apron.

        Terminator walks out, without expression, leaving the

        woman to sag to the floor in a faint.

        strokes with a hacksaw to sever the wooden stock from

        stump, like a pistol grip.

        CUT WIDER as Reese hefts the weapon.  He is crouched in

        an underground service tunnel below a busy street.  Shadows

        of people walking across a grating in the sidewalk above

        him flicker past.  They can't see him in the darkness below

        their feet as he checks the gun's action carefully.  He

        slips it under his overcoat where it hangs from a jerry-

        rigged sling.

        Reese emerges from a stairwell behind a service station,

        his overcoat done up to the top button.

        He walks through the sparse morning crowd on the cluttered,

        overbuilt commercial street.

        He is out of sync.

        A stranger in a strange land.

        He holds himself tightly reined, cautious and feral as he

        moves among the unconcerned pedestrians.

        His eyes flick rapidly about.

        He is seeing this Babylon for the first time.

        Reese stops at a hole-in-the-wall take-out stand.  He

        watches people walk away with food.  Moves closer.

        Scrutinizes the next man as he orders.

                      Gimme a falafel with yogurt

        The counterman hands him his food and change wordlessly

                      That'll be one-sixty.

                      Aha!  Is she young?

        Mr. Miller lowers his menu and glares at her.

        shorts out and peers down.  She shakes her head.

                      Let's go.

        She grabs Sarah by the arm and pulls her out the door.

        Sarah catches a glimpse of Marco's expression over her

        In F.G., two Conan-esque arms thrust upward, glistening.

        Ginger's boyfriend, MATT McCALLISTER, the assistant manager

        enormous weight on the Nautilus machine.

        people you'd ever want to meet.

        His face is contorted, muscles knotted for the last push.

        He heaves it up with a guttural cry.

        Lowering his weights with a CLANG, Matt lies panting, arms

        dangling at his side, eyes closed.

        A pair of female legs appear.

        Ginger pulls the pin on Mat's weights and re-inserts it

        beneath the entire stack, the maximum weight.

                      'Bye beautiful.  You too,

                      Ginger.

        Two weightlifters nearby look at each other, than at Matt.

        Sarah lurches away from the curb on her moped, almost

        spilling Ginger who is attempting to ride double.  They

        swing out onto a main thoroughfare and careen through

        the bumper-to-bumper traffic.

        Sarah maneuvers deftly though overloaded and unstable.

        Ginger doesn't know whether to laugh of scream at the

        near-misses.

        She does both.

        On a side street the girls pass an excavation site  between

        high-rises.  They pass OUT OF FRAME as CAMERA HOLDS on the

        construction area and Ginger's shrieks fade.

        In the F.G., under an overpass, Reese sits is a car watching

        the powerful machines moving earth.

        He's in a late-model non-descript GREY SEDAN, one of a row

        of cars gathering dirt beside the construction site.

        Crab-armed back-hoes and massive caterpillars ROAR through

        a curtain of dust, under intense floodlights.  A power-shovel

        moves its great arm, lighting its own way with an arc-light.

        Reese sits motionless in the dark.  Waiting.  The clock in

        the dash ticks quietly.

        He flips on the radio.  A fatuous POP ROCK STATION.

        Reese fishes a magazine off the dirty floor.  His over-

        coat is off, draped over the shotgun on the seat beside

        him.

        His bare arms are sinewy and scarred.

        Reese flips the page of COSMOPOLITAN.

        He look at the glossy photos, the glossy women.

        Fantasy women.  Svelte and seamless.

        The ads fascinate him too: Caribbean vacations and blended

        whiskeys.

        His head sags against the door.

        He gazes dully at the tracks of a passing CATERPILLAR as they

        chew through the dirt.

        The ROAD and CLATTER of treads intensifies as his eyes close.

        TIGHT ON A GLEAMING STEEL TREAD as it grinds through debris.

        The debris is ferroconcrete, girders, and jackstraw heaps of

        HUMAN BONES, burned black.

        There is the sound of EXPLOSIONS, distant, and an intermittent

        electronic WHINE.  Incredibly bright searchlights play over

        the ground.  PANNING with the moving treads through twisted

        wreckage, F.G.

        The screen WHITES OUT with a BLAST, very close.  As the

        debris clatters down, a helmetted head snaps up into FRAME,

        EXTREME F.G.

        The visor of the HIGH-TECH HELMET is shattered, presumably

        by the explosion.  The wearer rips it off, revealing a

        younger Reese, minus his burn scar.

        His face is bathed in sweat, lit by the glow from a CRT

        SCOPE-SIGHT on a strange-looking rifle.

        The sound of SCREAMS and HOARSE SHOUTS not far off, and a

        continuous low murmuring of RADIO CHATTER, grid coordinates,

        casualties, unit placements, medic requests.

        Reese looks over his shoulder at his teammate, a GIRL

        of about sixteen, gaunt, dirty, heavily armed like himself.

        DOLLYING as they start to belly crawl through the bones

        and wreckage.

        Reese looks up.

        Through spires of a collapsed building a terrifying

        SPHINX-LIKE SHAPE moves against the sky...obscured by dust

        and blinding sweeps of its searchlights.

        Though we see little, this is an H-K,Hunter-Killer

        mobile ground-unit.

        Reese crawls, pacing the H-K, under and through, on elbows

        and knees, past mounds of charred skulls.  They

        pass the BODY OF A CHILD, a boy of about 10, center-

        punched with a smoking hole.  The boy clutches a rifle.

        More bodies.  Some in rags, some in uniforms like theirs.

        WOMEN. OLD MEN. CHILDREN.  They're all dirty and gaunt,

        scabrous.  And still bleeding.  Reese scrabbles past a

        dark rat-hole and there are human rats in it.  Some of them

        are sobbing, or screaming.

        Another EXPLOSION.

        The GLARE lights the huddled few.

        Human vermin with mud-caked weapons that haven't been

        invented yet.  Soldiers in a nightmare war.

        Reese and his teammate stop behind a blasted wall, having

        outflanked the massive H-K.  Its flashing blue lights flick

        across the walls, its searchlights sear through the

        debris.

        WIDER, showing the H-K more clearly...a blast-scarred

        CHROME LEVIATHON, with hydraulic arms folded mantis-like

        against its 'torso', and huge underslung GUN TURRETS.

        Reese leaps up and straight-arms a satchel-charge into its

        path.  One tread rolls over the explosive.

        Guns and searchlights swivel.  The head turns ponderously.

        Reese's partner rises, poised to throw hers.

        A POWER-BOLT catches her at the top of her arc, BLOWING

        HER INTO RED MIST.

        Reese is knocked down by the concussion.  Gets up, running,

        as the charges blow.

        The H-K's tread carriers are RIPPED APART.

        It lurches to a stop, burning.

        The following SEQUENCE is extremely FORESHORTENED.

        CUT FAST.  IMPRESSIONS ONLY.

        Running.

        Explosions light the ruins like flashbulbs.

        ENERGY WEAPONS criss-cross the night like tracers.

        LOW ANGLE, up past the burning H-K as its flying counter-

        part, an AERIAL H-K, arcs into view with a TURBOJET WHINE.

        Reese hauls two survivors of his unit into a PERSONNEL

        CARRIER, a CHEVY CAMARO with steel plate welded over it and

        the roof cut away to access the 50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN.

        It's stripped and rusted and bullet-riddled, glassless.

        The TIRES are OFF-ROAD and very gnarly.

        They're driving through the ruins, up and over and through.

        Reese drives like a demon.  Under other circumstances it

        would be considered insane.  Here it is merely very good.

        The machine gun CHATTERS.

        A BLACK SHAPE descends, a demon with searchlights.

        A BOLT OF LIGHT.

        Reese's car flips like a kicked beer can, rolling and

        crumpling.  He's pinned in the wreck, bloody, screaming

        despite his training.  The only other survivor, an

        emaciated BOY of twelve, is pulling for all he's worth

        to drag Reese out before it burns.

        is a SHOTGUN MUZZLE AIMED RIGHT AT US.

        Reese quivers with a curious spasm, similar to the tremors

        of his arrival, and blinks at the boy.

        The boy is white-faced, staring down the bore.  He backs

        away.  We see that he is straddling a bicycle.

        Sarah and Ginger are crammed into the tiny bathroom,

        becoming inextricably tangled in each other's cords as

        they blow-dry, curl hair, and apply make-up.  Ginger

        has her headphones inverted under her chin but in place,

        and is bouncing to music as she dries her hair.  She is

        wearing a short terry-cloth bathrobe that reveals the

        greater part of her legs.  Sarah is in a skirt and bra.

        The phone rings and Sarah goes out into the living room

        to get it.

                                SARAH

                           (on phone, deep

                           and breathy)

                      First I'm going to rip the

                      buttons off your blouse, one

                      by one...then run my tongue

                      along your neck, down to your

                      bare, gleaming breasts...

        Sarah cups her hand over the mouthpiece and calls out

        matter-of-factly:

                                SARAH

                      Ginger!  It's Matt.

        She resumes listening.

                                MATT (V.O.)

                      ...and then slowly pull your

                      jeans off inch by inch and

                      lick your belly in circles,

                      further and further down...

                      then I'll pull off your panties

                      with my teeth...

        Sarah is repressing laughter.

                                SARAH

                           (crossly)

                      Who is this?

        Silence.  Then Matt realizes to his horror who he's been

        talking to.

                                MATT (V.O.)

                      Oh my God!  Sarah!  Oh, shit.

                      Jesus, I'm sorry.  I thought

                      you were...Can I talk to Ginger?

                                SARAH

                      Sure, Bunky.

        As Ginger approaches, Sarah hands her the receiver and

        goes into the bedroom.

                                GINGER

                      Hello?

                      off your blouse...

        Sarah gathers up the blouses and walks out.

        screeches to the curb behind two marked black-and-whites

        in front of a funky Venice apartment building.  A small

        crowd  is gathered around the front steps.  LIEUTENANT

        ED VUKOVICH, Homicide Division, gets out of the car and

        strides through the crowd.  He's fiftyish, short, but

        square and solid, a human bulldog gone a little to paunch.

        He chews Juicy Fruit gum like a maniac: a chain-chewer.

        He's homely as an old boot.  And he's not a smart cop, he's

        a wise one; rarer still.  The onlookers, gathered patiently

        for their ten second glimpse of something under a sheet,

        separate for him to pass.

        back staircase two steps at a time.  He passes TWO UNIFORMED

        COPS at the doorway of a second-floor apartment, and enters

        to find a quiet flurry of activity.  Several DETECTIVES and

        a PHOTOGRAPHER prowl around, taking evidence, taking pictures.

        In the center of the living room floor is the body of a

        young woman, crumpled face down in a small lake of blood.

        Two bags of groceries lie split open on the floor in front

        of her.

        Vukovich glances up as he is joined by DETECTIVE SGT.

        TRAXLER.  Traxler is black, lean and very jaded.

                                VUKOVICH

                      Give me the short version.

                                TRAXLER

                      Six shots at less than ten

                      feet.  Weapon was a large

                      No shit.

        Traxler turns to a passing DETECTIVE.

        Ginger enters, stopping beside their phone answering machine.

                      Not lately.  Did you check

        C.U. - PUGSLEY, as the GREEN IGUANA cocks its head, blinking

        vapidly.

        RESUME WIDE, Sarah lifts the three foot long lizard from his

        perch on the windowsill.  She gives the complacent reptile

        a kiss on its blunt snout.

                      Totally nauseating.

        Sarah drapes the lizard across her shoulders where it sits

        contentedly as she looks for her purse.  Ginger has been

        rewinding the message tape.  She punches PLAY and a MALE

        VOICE is heard.

                      Uh, something's come up and

                      it looks like I won't be able

                      to make it tonight.  I'm really

                      sorry.  Call you in a day or so.

                      Sorry.  'Bye.

        Sarah stands still, crestfallen.

                                GINGER

                      That bum.  So what if he has

                      a Porsche, he can't treat you

                      like that...it's Friday night

                      I'll break his kneecaps.

        Sarah resignedly slips Pugsley off her shoulders.

                                SARAH

                      You still love me, don't

                      you, Pugsley?

        She places Pugsley in a large terrarium with a 'BEWARE OF

        DOG' sign taped on the side.

        garage.

        ON SARAH - C.U., inexplicably nervous.

        She stows the chain and starts the bike.  It whines

        reassuringly.

        Sarah jumps on and whirs out of the garage.

        The book slips out of her fingers.

        Sarah turns and scans the crowd.

        She's getting looks, covert and otherwise, like any unaccom-

        panied girl on a Friday night.  But is that all they mean?

        Sarah back into the women's restroom.

                                               CUT TO:

69      INT. RESTROOM                                          69

        Sarah stumbles numbly to the sink.

        She splashes her face with cold water.  In the mirror

        her terrified reflection looks back.  Why me?

        She hears a loud clatter and spins around.

        It's just a drunken woman fumbling with a toilet stall door.

        Sarah edges back out into the corridor.

                                               CUT TO:

        Sarah walks stiffly to the pay phone.

        It's OUT OF ORDER.

                                               CUT TO:

71      EXT. STREET/SIDEWALK - NIGHT                           71

        Sarah exits the pizza place into the sparse crowd on the

        sidewalk.  As she passes a figure leaning against the wall

        just outside, the man turns his head to watch her.

        It is Reese, his gaze impassive.

        Streetlight catches the burn scar on his cheek.

        He is motionless, sinister in his long coat.

        Sarah shudders.

        She walks on.

        POV - SARAH, ON CROWD, moving toward and through approaching

        groups of pedestrians.  They seem to be glancing at her.

        Was it always like that and she just never noticed?

        C.U. - SARAH as she look over her shoulder.

        POV - SARAH, ON PIZZA PARLOR DOORWAY.  Reese is gone.

        She resists the urge to run.

        On the opposite side of the street an  LAPD cruiser glides

        slowly by.  Sarah is about to call out but a bus blocks

        her view and when it had passed, the car is turning away

        down a side street.

        She passes a large window with STOKER'S written on it, and

        ducks quickly through the door.

                                               CUT TO:

        ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW, SARAH F.G., as Reese approaches.

        Her knuckles clench white as he reaches the entrance and

        walks by, unhurriedly, without a glance inside.

        She turns and scan the gloomy interior, which reveals itself

        to be less than savory.  Pool tables and upper-middle lowlife

        in submarine depths of smoky haze.

        Sarah draws stares, menacing in their own right, as she

        weaves between the pool tables to the back of the bar.

        her hands are trembling as she drops a dime in the pay

        phone and dials.

                                VOICE (V.O./RECORDED)

                      You have reached the Los Angeles

                      Police Department Emergency Number.

                      All lines are busy.  If you need

                      a police car sent out to you, please

                      stay on the line...

        Sarah holds the receiver pressed to her ear, glancing

        around, fear feeding on frustration.

73      EXT. SARAH'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT                73

        An LAPD black-and-white sits at the curb in front of Sarah's

        building with two cops inside, drinking coffee.  Through

        the open window we hear the dispatcher's voice on the

        radio.

                                DISPATCHER (V.O.)

                      ...two eleven in progress at

                      Seven-Eleven market, Third and

                      Tamarac.  One suspect believed

                      to be armed...

        The car pulls out with lights and siren on.

        A moment later, Terminator rounds the corner of the building

        and climbs the stairs to the entryway.

        He surveys the bank of call buttons, then turns to consider

        the barred security gate.

                                               CUT TO:

74      INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                         74

        PANAGLIDE WITH GINGER as she ties her terry-cloth robe and,

        leaving Matt in a dead sleep, pads through the dark apartment.

        Down the hall, past the phone with Traxler's message.

        Through the dark living room.

        She has her Walkman in the pocket of her robe and bops to

        herself in the silent gloom as she enters the kitchen.

        When she opens the refrigerator to remove snack fixings, the

        light briefly illuminates the kitchen and in that moment,

        SOMETHING MOVES in the F.G.

        TIGHT ON GINGER, MOVING WITH HER as she backs toward the

        counter with her arms full of snack stuff.

        A SUDDEN CRASH.  A flurry of motion behind her.

        She spins, dropping half her load.

        Ginger fumbles for the lightswitch.

        Revealing Pugsley, sitting there blinking innocently among

        overturned spice bottles on the counter-top.

                                GINGER

                      Shoo.  Go on.  I'll make a

                      belt out of you.

        Pugsley disappears into a large fern by the window and Ginger

        sets about her task, slathering crunchy peanut butter on

        stalks of celery.

                                               CUT TO:

75      INT. BEDROOM                                           75

        MEDIUM ON MATT, as rustling curtains play patterns of street-

        light over his sleeping face.

        The sound of a faint breeze.

        In the B.G. is the balcony, empty.  The sliding door is open.

        TIGHT ON MATT, as his eyes open at the sound of a quiet,

        repeated CLICKING.

        UP ANGLE - PAST MATT, as the five-inch blade of an industrial

        razor-knife reaches full extension in Terminator's hand,

        right above him.

        It slashes viciously downward.

        Matt rolls and the pillow is SLIT OPEN where his throat had

        been.

                                MATT

                      Whoah!

        Terminator catches him by the hair and slashed down again.

        Matt grabs the wrist in both hands.

        The enormous muscles of his arms, which seem capable of bench

        pressing a Chrysler, strain and knot against the pressure of

        the killer's single arm...

        And still the blade moves closer to his throat.

        With a final heave Matt deflects the down-pressure sideways

        and the blade snaps with a CLINK against the headboard.

        HANDHELD WITH MATT as he rolls off the bed, spins and slams

        his fists together into Terminator's temple.  He picks up a

        brass deco lamp and brings it down with piledriver force.

        Unperturbed, Terminator knocks the lamp away and hurls Matt

        over the bed.

                                               CUT TO:

        Matt crashes through the glass doors and slams against the

        balcony railing.

        Oblivious to the noise, Ginger croons in rock-and-roll

        ecstasy, singing to a celery stalk as if it were a micro-

        phone.

78      EXT./INT. BALCONY AND BEDROOM - NIGHT                  78

        Matt heaves himself up, powerful body gleaming with sweat

        and hurls himself upon the intruder.

        The titans CRASH INTO A DRESSER, reducing it to kindling.

        Then into the closet door, EXPLODING THE FULL-LENGTH MIRROR.

        Terminator places one hand on either side of Matt's barrel

        chest.  SINKS HIS FINGERS INTO THE FLESH.  An inhuman grip.

        Matt is raised off the floor, contorted with agony, above

        the other's head.

        DOLLY PRECEDING GINGER as she returns from the kitchen with

        a plate full of celery stalks and a glass of milk.  CAMERA

        passes the closed bedroom door and STOPS, as Ginger pauses

        to set the plate on top of the glass, freeing one hand to

        open the door.

        AN EXPLOSION OF SPLINTERS in close F.G. as a shape smashes

        through the door right in front of her...Matt's body

        propelled halfway through the door by enormous force.

        Ginger shrieks and leaps back, flinging milk and all into

        the air.

        The door begins to open the pressure of Matt's body

        creates resistance.

        Ginger SCREAMS and back away.

        The door is wrenched open and Terminator steps through with

        the massive .45 drawn.

        HANDHELD WITH GINGER, the walls blur by as she runs.

        TIGHT ON TERMINATOR as the pistol RISES INTO FRAME, aligning

        with his eyes.  BOOM!

        LOW FAST DOLLY WITH GINGER as the bullet punches into her

        shoulder, pitching her on her face outside the bathroom door.

        LOW WIDE ANGLE as she crawls forward, gasping, drowning.

        The implacable figure looms behind her.

        Her expression is agony and reeling, nauseating terror.

        And incomprehension: Why am I suddenly dying?

        Her eyes roll, showing the whites, like a horse tethered in

        a burning stable.

        Ginger scrabbles pathetically for a grip on the tile floor

        as she pulls herself into the bathroom.

        She clutches the rim of the toilet.

        LOW ANGLE PAST HER, ON TERMINATOR, as he stands behind her.

        PAN UP, off her.  He takes aim.

        And empties the clip.

        He calmly reloads.

        CLOSE ON PHONE MACHINE, as the telephone rings loudly in the

        ensuing silence.

        Terminator spins, drawing an instantaneous bead on the source

        of the sound, but doesn't fire.

                                GINGER'S VOICE

                           (recorded)

                      Hi there.

                           (pause)

                      Ha ha ha, fooled you.  You're

                      talking to a machine...

        C.U. - TERMINATOR, motionless, listening.

                                GINGER'S VOICE

                           (recorded, continuing)

                      ...but don't be shy, it's okay.

                      Machines need love too...

        Terminator turns abruptly back to Ginger's body.  He turns

        it over, assuring himself that she is dead.

                                GINGER'S VOICE

                           (continuing, recorded)

                      ...so talk to it and Ginger, that's

                      me, or Sarah will get back to you.

                      Wait for the beep.

        There is a loud tone and the incoming call is heard.

                           (on machine)

                      Ginger, this is Sarah...

        Terminator's head snaps back and he freezes, listening.

        He rises slowly as Sarah's voice continues.

        TIGHT ON HIS UNBLINKING EYES.

                                SARAH'S VOICE

                      It's Stoker's on Pico. Bye.

        Terminator is rapidly and methodically rifling the contents

        of Sarah's small desk.  SIREN'S WAIL, approaching.

        He picks up a small card.

        E.C.U. - CARD. It is Sarah's college I.D. card, complete with

        color photo of her.

        MACRO ON PICTURE.

        E.C.U. - TERMINATOR'S EYES as he tosses the card down,

        after a fraction of a second's scan.  Picks up something else.

        TIGHT ON SARAH'S ADDRESS BOOK, Terminator pockets this and

        slips out the balcony door.  Climbing over the railing, he

        is gone.

89      EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                    89

        The yellow Maverick hurtles along an empty street.

        CLOSER ANGLE as streetlight glare slashes across Terminator's

        face in flaring pulses.

                                               CUT TO:

90      INT. PLAIN CAR - NIGHT                                 90

        Vukovich draws his Colt Python .357 Magnum and check the

        load.  Traxler is driving.

                                VUKOVICH

                      Let's see how this guy likes

                      playing hard-ball.

                                               CUT TO:

91      INT. STOKER'S BAR - NIGHT                              91

        The waitress set a cup of coffee in front of Sarah.

                                WAITRESS

                      Anything else?

        Sarah shakes her head "No" and contemplates her trembling

        hands.  She half-turns, catching a glimpse of herself in

        the mirror behind the bar.

        TIGHT ON SARAH, reflected in the mirror.  In the F.G. a

        man at the bar looks up from his beer, straight into her eyes.

        It is Reese.

        He gazes at her coolly for a moment, then glances away.

        C.U. - SARAH, feeling trapped, frantic.

        ANGLE ON FRONT DOOR as it opens and a figure stands silhou-

        etted briefly against a streetlight.

        Reese turns, his eyes flickering to the mirror, the figure.

        C.U. - REESE as he mechanically raises his beer.  His knuckles

        are white.  He slowly undoes the top button of his overcoat.

        There is a glint of metal in the shadows within.

        Reese turns slowly on his barstool as the figure brushes past

        him, out-of-focus F.G.

        Sarah looks up.

        E.C.U. - REESE'S HAND sliding slowly along polished steel,

        a caress.  His finger slips through the triggerguard of the

        riot gun.

        MEDIUM ON SARAH, as the man stops in front of her in close F.G.

        He sits slowly in the booth opposite her.  The angle is OVER

        HIS SHOULDER.

                                SARAH

                           (uncertainly)

                     Lieutenant Vukovich?

        REVERSE ANGLE - It is not Lt. Vukovich.

        Terminator sits motionless for a BEAT.

        Blue eyes so pure and deep.  The eyes of a saint, perhaps.

        The .45 is out and cocked and AIMED DIRECTLY AT CAMERA, almost

        in one motion.

        The bore seems enormous.

        BACK ON SARAH, over the gun barrel, her eyes go wide.  We hold

        a BEAT, like a frozen slice of nightmare.

        MEDIUM ON REESE as he whips the riot-gun to a hip-firing posi-

        tion, his overcoat falling back with a snap.  HE FIRES.

        ON TERMINATOR, as the shotgun blast hits his arm and he FIRES,

        simultaneously.  Sarah screams as the .45 round blows stuffing

        out of the booth seat inches from her face.  Her hair is

        singed by burning gunpowder.  An involuntary cry is punched

        out of her by the double concussions.

        Reese is stroking up another shell as Terminator half-rises

        from booth.

        OVER REESE'S SHOULDER, as he fires, cocks the slide, fires

        again, advancing on Sarah's booth.

        Terminator is blown backward over the center divider,

        crashing through the glasses and pitchers of beer on the

        table opposite, and onto the floor.

        Sarah is screaming, scrunched down in the booth.

        Terminator is lying on his back at the feet of a table-

        full of drunk patrons.

        He has two rifled 12 gauge slugs in his chest and one

        in the arm.

        The bar customers are frozen in the weird tableau, cowering,

        gaping.

        Sarah stops screaming.

        Reese stand motionless, gun aimed.

        In the sudden silence, the sound of him cocking the shotgun

        is abnormally loud.

        ON TERMINATOR, very still.

        Then he smoothly rolls to a crouch and slips the UZI machine

        pistol from beneath his overcoat, where it has been hang-

        ing on a shoulder strap.

        He doesn't seem too impaired as he swings around to fire.

        Reese rolls like a cat and comes up firing.

        A burst from the UZI rakes the bar where he stood.

        An orgy of shattering glass.

        Total pandemonium.

        SEVERAL ANGLES  as patrons of the bar run, scream or dive

        for cover, depending upon their level of intelligence.

        Reese slides through the glass to Sarah's booth and seizes

        her wrists.

        ON TERMINATOR, kneeling amid the chaos, raising the UZI

        one-handed.

        Reese tugs viciously on Sarah's arm and she sprawls across

        the booth seat a moment before the divider and seat cushion

        erupt with hits from the UZI.

        ANGLE ON A RUNNING PATRON as a burst of 9mm fire catches

        him in the chest.  He pitches into Sarah's booth, pinning

        her.

        Reese fires, ducks, fires again.

        Tables crash over.

        A window is blown out.

        A table candle rolls into a pool of high-proof alcohol

        behind the bar.

        It ignites with a WHOOSH.

        Reese feed two shells into the riot-gun.

        TIGHT ON TERMINATOR, an island of slow, precise movement

        amid the confusion.  He drops a spent clip.  Reaches for

        another with his bloody hand.

        MOVING WITH REESE as he vaults the row of booths and starts

        firing.  At point blank range he unloads the shotgun into

        Terminator's belly.

                                               CUT TO:

92      INT./EXT. STOKER'S/STREET - NIGHT                      92

        Terminator crashes backwards through two tables and a plate

        glass window into the street.

                                               CUT TO:

93      INT. STOKER'S BAR - NIGHT                              93

        The roaring fire behind the bar is spreading very quickly.

        The air is thick with smoke.

        Reese tosses the UZI, for which he has no ammo, into the

        fire.  He hauls the dead man off Sarah and reaches for her.

        TIGHT ON SARAH, shrinking away from Reese, hysterical.

        When he grabs her wrist she struggles, eyes wide.

        C.U. - REESE, very intense.

                                REESE

                     Come with me if you want

                     to live.

        She looks where he is pointing.

94      EXT. STOKER'S BAR/STREET - NIGHT                       94

        Terminator is rising unsteadily to his feet.  Shattered

        glass rains from him, except where it sticks to his blood-

        drenched shirt and coat.

        C.U. - TERMINATOR, as he slowly look up, his blue eyes

        riveting STRAIGHT INTO THE CAMERA.

                                               CUT TO:

95      INT. STOKER'S BAR - NIGHT                              95

        C.U. - SARAH, feeling a lightning blot of terror greater

        than she could ever imagine as the cold gaze fixes on her.

                                SARAH

                           (awed whisper)

                     Oh my God...

96      INT./EXT. STOKER'S BAR - NIGHT                         96

        PANAGLIDE PRECEDING TERMINATOR as he clambers back through

        the window and starts through the burning bar.

97      INT. STOKER'S BAR - NIGHT                              97

        PANAGLIDE MOVING IN ON REESE AND SARAH as he runs, drag-

        ging her with him, toward the back.

        REVERSE ON TERMINATOR, DOLLYING as he crashed through the

        wreckage in the swirling smoke, hurling burning tables out

        of his way.

                                               CUT TO:

98      INT. KITCHEN/HALLWAY/EXIT CORRIDOR                     98

        PANAGLIDE FOLLOWING REESE AND SARAH, running headlong

        through the cluttered kitchen, then down a narrow back

        hallway.  Sarah stumbles and Reese brutally pulls her to

        her feet without slowing.

        He hits a closed door, which crashes open.

        Hauls Sarah through, into another corridor.

        Slams and blot-latches it.

        An instant later an impact from the far side tears the

        latch-screws half out of the wall.

        They run on.

                                               CUT TO:

99      INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                   99

        Terminator takes a step back from the closed door and

        slams into it again.  It starts to give way.

        behind him the flames engulf a CAN OF CLEANING SOLVENT.

                                               CUT TO:

100     INT./EXT. EXIT CORRIDOR/ALLEY - NIGHT                  100

        Reese and Sarah pelt down the narrow corridor, fling open

        the outside door and spin out into the alley.

        TIGHT ON DOOR at far end.  It splinters open and Terminator

        sprints down the corridor.

                                               CUT TO:

102     INT. EXIT CORRIDOR - NIGHT                             102

        DOLLYING AHEAD OF TERMINATOR, very fast, as he runs full-

        throttle.  Behind him a fireball of superheated gas hurtles

        down the narrow hallway.  He clears the outer door an

        instant before the tongue of flame roars out into the alley.

                                               CUT TO:

103     EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF STOKER'S - NIGHT               103

        Vukovich's plain car arrives, slewing to a stop in the

        glass-littered street in front of the blazing building.

        He leaps out, Traxler right in behind him.

                                VUKOVICH

                           (shouting)

                     What the fuck is going on?

        TWO LAPD UNITS arrive behind them.  He motions to the

        nearest one.

                                VUKOVICH

                           (continuing)

                     Cover the alley in back.

        He heads for the inferno at a run.

104     EXT. ALLEY BEHIND STOKER'S - NIGHT                     104

        DOLLYING WITH REESE AND SARAH as they run through the

        dark alley.  Sarah stumbles over trashcans.

        Reese pulls her along mercilessly.

        WHIP-PANNING as they clear a corner.

        The B.G. is a blur.

        The night-maze is a blur in all of these shots.

        No static angles.

        Relentless forward motion.

105/FX  EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                     105/FX

        Behind them Terminator is moving with inhuman speed,

        bounding like a panther, leaping trash cans and other

        obstacles.

        TRACKING C.U. - TERMINATOR, catching the faintest glimpse

        of a red glow in the pupils of his eyes as he passes through

        total shadow.

                                               CUT TO:

106/FX  EXT. ALLEY/POV - TERMINATOR (HANDHELD) - NIGHT         106/FX

        We know this is Terminator's POV because Sarah and Reese

        are just ahead of us.  But the image is bizarre, alien.

        Bright and hyper-real.  There is a hint of digitization,

        and the fleeing figures ahead are more luminous than the

        background, suggesting infra-red.

        The margins of the FRAME are crammed with columns of CRT-

        type characters: columns of numbers and acronyms.  The

        data changes more rapidly than any human eye could follow.

        There is no doubt that we are seeing as a machine would see.

        The sound effects are bright and clear, as if they are

        digitized and enhanced as well.

                                               CUT TO:

107     EXT. ADJOINING ALLEY - NIGHT                           107

        Reese and Sarah turn a corner by caroming off the wall

        without slowing and pelt down a narrower alley.  This

        one is lined with a row of parked cars and connects to

        the street.  There is little room to run.

        Reese is reloading on the run, dropping shells.

        Behind them Terminator enters the alley, gaining.

        LOW ANGLE, FAST PANAGLIDE ahead of the fleeing pair.

        As they breast the last car Reese shoves Sarah hard,

        pitching her on her face to the pavement.

        He flings open the car door...a shield.

        Drops to the ground.

        Fires into the gas tank of a car further back in the row

        just before Terminator reaches it.

        The car EXPLODES, filling the alley with fire.  An inferno

        funneled between the enclosing walls.

        ANGLE ON REESE AND SARAH behind the car door as flames

        roar over the hood.

        ON TERMINATOR, as he slides to a stop, cut off by the

        wall of flame.

        Reese doesn't waste any time stuffing Sarah into the car.

        Climbing in after and over her he twists two wires together

        and we recognize it as his stolen GREY SEDAN.

        The engine catches.

        A SILHOUETTE rockets out of the flames.

        Terminator, leaping from the roof of the blazing car ahead,

        impacts on the hood of Reese's car.  His hair and coat are

        burning.

108     INT./EXT. GREY SEDAN/ALLEY - NIGHT                     108

        Reese jams reverse and nail the throttle.

        The car backs down the alley.

        Terminator draws back his fist.

        Punches into the windshield.

        Inside, Sarah is sprayed with glass as the killer's fist

        shoots through.

        The lacerated fingers grope for her.

        WIDE as the car shoots backwards out of the alley onto the

        street, narrowly missing an arriving LAPD CRUISER.

        Sarah plasters herself tightly into the seat as the

        fingers grasp her blouse and pull.

        Reese cranks the wheel hard.

                                               CUT TO:

109     EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                    109

        The sedan skids, slewing sideways into a parked car.

        Terminator rolls down off onto the pavement.

        Reese's car shoots forward.

        PANNING WITH SEDAN as it roars past Vukovich, the gathering

        minions of the burning building, an arriving fire

        truck...shoots through a red light and continues to accel-

        erate.

        Terminator gets to a kneeling position, then slowly stands.

        He pats out his smoldering clothing as he watches his quarry

        escape.

        ON VUKOVICH as he runs to his car, exhorting the nearby

        LAPD guys to give pursuit, while Traxler grabs the radio.

                                VUKOVICH

                           (shouting)

                     Go!  Go!  He's got her.

        LOW WIDE ANGLE on the empty street, which is narrow and

        tightly lines with parked cars.

        The ROAR of an engine builds.

        The sedan, like a night-demon, hurtles out of the shadows

        with its lights off, doing ninety plus.

                                               CUT TO:

112     INT. GREY SEDAN - NIGHT                                112

        Sarah is in a daze.

        Paralyzed.  Face bloodless.

        She is shivering silently, uncontrollably.

        Her eyes are wide, and it seems likely that she doesn't

        quite comprehend the roaring blur outside her window.

                                REESE

                           (calmly)

                     Hold on.

113     EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT                              113

        WIDE ANGLE, CLOSE TO SEDAN, and following it as it hurtles

        around a corner in an expertly controlled slide.

        Then a high speed sprint down the cross-street.

        Reese squirrels the vehicle between a slow-moving car

        Reese drives with total, nerveless absorption.  His eyes

        flick to the mirror, to the road, over his shoulder, back

        ...and the world spins outside.

        With occasional glances to Sarah, he speaks to her in a

        clipped, military voice.

                                REESE

                     Are you injured?  Are you

                     shot?

        No response.

        He reaches over and runs his hands over her arms, legs,

        chest.  Sarah flinches.

        She feels the BLIND PANIC BOILING UP WITHIN HER.

        She pushes his hand away and opens the door.

        Reese slams her back in the seat and slaps her.  Hard.

                                REESE

                           (continuing)

                     sound unless I say.  Do

                     you understand?

        As he speaks he is locking the door and fastening Sarah's

        seatbelt over her, cinching it very tightly, like you would

        for a child.  She doesn't answer.

        Sarah stares numbly at his outstretched hand.  With zero

        strength she automatically returns his handshake.

        The walls of a narrow alley, inky black, frame a police

        cruiser parked on the street beyond.  Firelight from the

        back of Stoker's lights the street garishly.

        A young cop  stands beside the car talking via radio with

        the mike cord pulled through the side window.  He speaks

        with a distinctive twang--a displaced southerner.

                                COP

        The sweeping headlights of a turning car momentarily illuminate

        the face of Terminator, motionless in the dark right in

        front of us.

        Eyes open.  Listening.

                      Better get another truck

                      round to this side.

        Terminator's silhouette emerges from the blackness and

        strides purposefully toward the cop, CAMERA following.

        The officer whirls and reaches for his gun but Terminator

        flings him brutally into the side of the car, steps over

        him and opens the door.

        Before getting in he notes the unit number on the roof: 143.

        Then he slides behind the wheel, slips the squad car into

        gear, and pulls out.

        rapidly, until the lines across the street are flashing

        Sarah is slumped way down in the seat, turned away from the

        window, trying not to see the landscape reeling outside.

        Slowly, without releasing her, he reaches across with his

        other hand and shuts the door.  His face shows no reaction.

        Sarah draws back and stares at the blood running down his

        arm from the bite, that at his grim, scarred face.  The

        light turns green and Reese drives on.

        Sarah tastes blood and wipes her mouth.

129     EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT                               129

        Reese's car turns into the parking lot of a large hospital,

        acres of pavement dotted with sporadic parked cars.

        ANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD, ON TERMINATOR, as he searches.

        Streetlights flare across rhythmically.

        It moves between two buildings, searchlight sweeping back

        and forth.  DOWN ANGLE, past the chopper, as the circle of

        light moves across a row of parked cars.

        It passes a grey sedan with a shattered windshield.

        Flicks back.  Holds.

        TIGHTER ON CAR, GROUND LEVEL, in the glare and propwash.

        It looks empty.

132     EXT. PARKING LOT/NEARBY  - NIGHT                       132

        LOW ANGLE DOLLY, MOVING WITH REESE AND SARAH as they crawl

        behind a row of parked cars.

        He has firm hold of her arm but she seems to be cooperating.

        In the B.G., the chopper hovers, on the far side of the lot.

        Reese approaches the door of a late model brown Buick which

        has been left with its window partway down.

        He unlocks it and they slip inside.

                                               CUT TO:

133     EXT./INT. TERMINATOR'S CRUISER - NIGHT                 133

        TIGHT ON TERMINATOR, through the windshield of the black-

                      parking lot, Cedar and Glen-

                      haven...

        FULL SHOT as Terminator's cruiser slews in a radical turn

        and roars off in the opposite direction.

                                               CUT TO:

134     INT./EXT. BROWN BUICK/PARKING LOT - NIGHT              134

        Reese uses the butt of the shotgun to smash loose the

        ignition assembly.  He begins working on the wires.  A

        police cruiser appears, moving slowly between the rows of

        cars.

        Reese grabs Sarah and pulls her down to huddle below dash

        level.  A moment later a spotlight flashes across the seats

        above them.  They hear the helicopter circling closer.

                                SARAH

                      Reese...why me?  Why does

                      it want me?

        They are lying very close, a forced intimacy.  Reese's voice

        is an urgent whisper, almost in her ear.  A cruiser passes

        so close they can hear its radio clearly.

                                REESE

                      There's so much...

                                SARAH

                      Tell me.  Just start at the

                      beginning.

        Reese musters his thoughts.  And starts.

                                REESE

                      There was a war.  A few years

                      from now.  Nuclear war.  The

                      whole thing.  All this--

        His gesture includes the car, the city, the world.

                                REESE

                           (continuing)

                      --everythingis gone.  Just

                      gone.  There were survivors.

                      Here.  There.  Nobody knew who

                      started it.

                           (pause)

                      It was the machines.

                                SARAH

                      I don't understand...

                                REESE

                      Defense network computer. New.

                      Powerful.  Hooked into everything.

                      Trusted to run it all.  They say it

                      got smart...a new order of intelli-

                      gence.  Then it saw all people as

                      a threat, not just the ones on the

                      other side.  Decided out fate in a

                      microsecond...extermination.

        Reese pauses, and when he continues it's less like a military

        briefing, quieter.

                                REESE

                           (continuing)

                      Didn't see the war.  I was born

                      after, in the ruins.  Grew up

                      there.  Starving.  Hiding from

                      the H-K's.

                      camps...for orderly disposal.

        He pushes up the sleeve of his jacket and shows

        her a ten digit number etches on the skin of his forearm.

        Beneath the numbers is a pattern of lines like the auto-

        matic-pricing marks on product packages.

                      Some of us were kept alive...

                      to work.  Loading bodies.  The

                      disposal units ran night and day.

                      We were that close to going out

                      forever...

        The helicopter moves overhead.  Its searchlight illum-

        inates the car interior, moves on.  Before the rotor

        sound fads, Reese starts the car.

        Several black-and-whites are moving among the parked

        cars, slowly.

        ANGLE ON TERMINATOR'S CRUISER rolling along just above

        idle.  He peers into the row of cars, listening and

        seeing on level we can't.

        appears behind it, moving slowly.

        C.U. - TERMINATOR, scanning.

        LOW ANGLE, past the back of the Buick, as Terminator

        cruises by.  The tailpipe, F.G., puffs quietly.

        Terminator's head snaps around.

        His eyes lock on Reese's car.

        He reaches for his shotgun.

        spinning as Terminator fires from the window of the

        Reese and Terminator race along opposite sides of a

        row of cars, approaching the exit.

        The cruiser pulls ahead and closes diagonally as they

        clear the last car.

        Reese sees the other's shotgun leveled.

        He ducks, steering blind, keeps it floored.

        The windshield and side window EXPLODES INWARD.

        The Buick slams into the black-and-white, spinning it into

        a parked truck.  TIRES SCREAM as the two cars slew around

        heading for the exit.

        SEVERAL ANGLES, as the police react.

        The chopper banks tight and dives across the tops of

        the parked cars.  Cruisers race to converge.

        street, accelerating.  Terminator's cruiser slides out

        behind it, fishtails, races forward.

        Engines roar as the cars go flat out.  Buildings lining

        the street become a blur.

        The chopper arcs in behind them.

        Legitimate police, lights blazing, enter the pursuit

        one by one.

        LOW ANGLE, MOVING WITH TERMINATOR'S CAR as Reese dodges

        across all lanes ahead of it.

        Terminator gaining.

        They run an intersection at a hundred plus.

        Sarah grabs the wheel, fighting to control the car.

        shotgun, buffeted by the windstream.

        Terminator's car, B.G., overtakes rapidly.

        MOVING WITH BOTH CARS as the Buick skids with rear tires

        locked.  Reese and Terminator FIRE simultaneously.

        TIGHT ON REESE as the doorpost next to his shoulder is

        torn out by the other's blast.

        ON TERMINATOR, leaning to see around his shattered wind-

        shield.  Too late.

        He hurtles into the intersection, past the skidding Buick.

        Clips the back of the semi.

        Spins radically.

        Vaults the curb in a screeching front-end roll.

        WHIP-PANNING WITH THE CRUISER as it crashes upside-down

        through the counter area of an A & W.

        LOW ANGLE as Reese and Sarah slide to a stop in a cloud

        of tire smoke.

        Transmission fluid pours out of the car like blood.

        An instant later they are surrounded by an assortment of

        LAPD, SHERIFF'S DEPT., and CHP CARS.

        The helicopter hovers overhead.

        MEDIUM ON SARAH AND REESE, he raises his hands, through

        the side window, in plain sight. A phalanx of cops, guns

        drawn, approaches the car warily.

        Sarah looks at Reese.  Then at the cops.  She opens the door

        and runs, staggering, toward them.  Vukovich steps forward

        and pulls her away to safety.

        They shine their flashlights inside.

        It is empty.

        A sign which reads 'DRIVE IN' detaches from an awning and

        crashed down across the crushed auto.

        Sarah, huddles in a blanket, is siting on a bench opposite

        Vukovich's desk.  Motionless.  Her eyes are fixed on the

        middle distance.  She's been crying.  Now she's emptied out.

        The door opens.

        At the sound of the latch Sarah jerks as if struck, and cringes

        involuntarily.  Vukovich enters with Traxler and DR. PETER

        SILBERMAN, a criminal psychologist.  Silberman is smooth

        of skin and manner, young, ambitious and...fat.  He is

        enthusiastic about the workings of the human psyche, as

        emotionally involved as someone pulling the wings off a fly.

        Vukovich sits beside Sarah and hands her a cup of coffee.

        He puts a paternal arm around her shoulders.

        Sarah  begins to cry again, slowly and very quickly.

        Vukovich takes the coffee cup from her as her arms sag and

        it starts to spill.

        The room costs five dollars a night and that's steep, but

        the FIRE ESCAPE outside the window adds an element of

        strategic value.

        A silhouette slips in through the window and click on the

        single BARE LIGHT BULB.

        It's Terminator, and he's a mess.

        A bloody scarecrow with bullet wounds in stomach, chest,

        shoulder and right wrist.

        MEDIUM ON TERMINATOR as he sits at a ratty folding table

        under the light.

        His eyebrows are singed off.

        Hair a charred stubble.

        Left eyes glistening with imbedded glass shards.

        Before him on the table is an array of SMALL TOOLS.

        He removes the charred remains of his jacket and props.

        one elbow on the table.

        ANGLE PAST HIS NON-FUNCTIONAL RIGHT ARM, F.G., as he exam-

        ines it.  He picks up an X-ACTO KNIFE and cuts deeply into

        the skin of his forearm.

        His expression is one of mild concentration.

        E.C.U. - FOREARM, as he pulls back a large flap of skin to

        reveal a complex trunk of SHEATHED CABLES AND HYDRAULICS.

        They slide as he moves his fingers.

        RESUME MEDIUM, as Terminator uses a rag to wipe away the

        blood.  With small screwdrivers he begins to patiently dis-

        assemble the damaged mechanism around the 12-guage hit.

                           (glancing around)

                      Sorry.

        C.U. - SARAH staring at the empty screen.

                                SARAH

                           (turning)

                      So Reese is crazy.

                                SILBERMAN

                      In technical terminology,

                      he's a loon.

                                SARAH

                      But...

        Vukovich hands her something that looks like umpire's

        padding.

                                VUKOVICH

                      Sarah, this is body armor.

                      Out TAC guys wear it.  It'll

                      stop a 12 gauge round.  This

                      other individual must've had

                      one under his coat.

        Sarah want to believe him.  God help her if he's wrong.

                                SARAH

                      But what about him punching

                      through the windshield?

                                TRAXLER

                           (shrugs)

                      Probably on PCP, broke every

                      bone in his hand and won't feel

                      it for hours.  There was this

                      guy once that...

        Vukovich cuts him off with a gesture and sits beside Sarah

        on the bench.

                                VUKOVICH

                      Why don't you just stretch out

                      here and get some sleep.  It'll

                      take your mom a good hour to get

                      here from Redlands.

                                SARAH

                      I can't sleep.

                                VUKOVICH

                      Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're

                      thirty cops in this building.

                                SARAH

                      Okay.

        She lays her head on a wadded up blanket as everyone

        Silberman can be seen through a glass partition next to

        the bullet-proof glass booth enclosing the NIGHT DESK

        SERGEANT'S counter.  The Sergeant hits a button and there

        is a loud BULL-CLACK.  The electric bolt on the security

        door opens and Silberman steps out.

        As he exits the station, he passes Terminator just coming in

        the front door.  He glances at the pale apparition in cap

        and dark wrap-arounds, but goes on.

        Terminator approaches the Desk Sergeant who barely glances

        up when he speaks.

                                TERMINATOR

                      I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.

                      I was told she is here.  Can

                      I see her, please?

                                SERGEANT

                      You can't see here.  She's

                      making a statement.

                                TERMINATOR

                      Where is she?

                      Look.  It's gonna be a while.

                      You wanna wait.  There's a

                      bench.

        Terminator steps back, scanning the booth, the electric

        door, the rooms beyond.

                                TERMINATOR

                      I'll come back.

        He turns and walks out through the front doors.

        ANGLE PAST DESK SERGEANT, F.G. - ON FRONT DOORS, the officer

        is absorbed in paperwork, not watching as a pair of lights

        get BRIGHTER outside the doors.  RAPIDLY.  He glances up

        at the last second as the glare falls fully on him.  CRASH!

        Several cops and late night loiterers scatter as a car

        smashes into the foyer.  It blasts through the sergeant's

        booth, crushing him in the wreckage.

        leap out of the car.

        He vaults the hood and smashes through the debris of the

        wall.

        Leaps to the corridor floor in a shower of plaster fragments.

        He brandishes the AR-180 like a pistol in one hand, the

        .38 in the other.

        The shotgun dangles at his side on a shoulder sling.

        LOW ANGLE DOLLY, preceding him as he starts down the

        explode, showering sparks and glass.

        trundles down crashing through the underbrush to dis-

        appear among the trees.

        Reese looks out across the valley and the lights of L.A.

        A helicopter circles in the distance, searchlight on.

                                REESE

                     Let's get off the road.

                                               CUT TO:

182     INT./EXT. DRAINAGE CULVERT - NIGHT                     182

        ANGLE LOOKING OUT from the mouth of an enclosed concrete

        storm drain that passes under the road.  Reese, followed

        by Sarah, trudges down the slope and ducks inside.

        The floor is wet but he doesn't seem to mind.

        They both hunker down with their backs to the concrete,

        facing each other.

        They look beaten, grimy, exhausted.

        She huddles under the blanket, waif-like.

                                REESE

                      You cold?

                                SARAH

                      Freezing.

                                REESE

                      Come here.

        She sits beside him and they wrap their arms around each

        other with the blanket covering both of them.

                                SARAH

                      Reese...you got a first name?

                                REESE

                      Kyle.

                                SARAH

                      Kyle, what's it like when you

                      go through time?

                                REESE

                      White light.  Pain.  Like

                      being ripped inside out...

                      slowly.  Like being born,

                      maybe.

        Sarah scowls and draws her hand out from under his jacket.

                                SARAH

                      You're wet.  Oh my god.

        In the beam of the flashlight her hand is glistening

        with blood.

                                REESE

                      I caught one, back there.

                                SARAH

                           (incredulous)

                      Caught one?  You mean you

                      got shot?

        Reese shrugs.

                                REESE

                      It's not bad.

        Sarah sits up and turns toward him.

                                SARAH

                      We gotta get you to a doctor.

                                REESE

                      It's okay.  Forget it.

                                SARAH

                      Forget it?  Are you crazy?

                      Let me see it.

        Sarah opens his jacket and the flashlight beam shows his

        shirt bloodsoaked at the shoulder.

                                SARAH

                           (continuing)

                      Jeez.  You idiot.  Take

                      this off.

        She cradles the flashlight between her knees and opens

        the first aid kit as he removes his jacket.

                                REESE

                           (looking at the

                           wound)

                      See.  Missed everything.

                      Passed through the meat.

        Sarah starts swabbing the flesh wound.

                                SARAH

                      This is gonna make me puke.

                      Talk about something.

                                REESE

                      What?

                                SARAH

                      Just talk.  Tell me about

                      my son.  Is he tall?

        She places a gauze pad in place and starts to wrap it.

                                REESE

                      About my height.  He

                      has your--

                           (winces)

                      ...damn...he has your

                      eyes.

        Sarah glances at his face for a second and then goes back

        to work.

                                SARAH

                      What's he like?

                                REESE

                           (thoughtful)

                      You trust him.  He's got that

                      strength.  You'd die in a

                      second for John.

                                SARAH

                      Well, at least I know what

                      to name him.  I don't suppose

                      you'd know who the father is?

                      So I don't tell him to get

                      lost when I meet him.

                                REESE

                      John never said much about

                      him.  He dies.  Even before

                      the war...

                                SARAH

                           (interrupting)

                      Stop!  I don't want to know.

                      Hold still.  So...it was John

                      that ordered you here?

                                REESE

                      I volunteered.

                                SARAH

                      You volunteered?

                                REESE

                      It was an honor.  A chance

                      to meet the legend.  Sarah

                      Connor.  Who taught her son

                      to fight...organize, prepare.

                      From when he was a kid.  When

                      you were in hiding, before

                      the war.

        She stops taping.  She seems lost, her bravado dissipated.

                                SARAH

                      You talk about things I haven't

                      done yet in the past tense.  It's

                      making me crazy.  I can't think.

                           (pause)

                      Are you sure you've got the

                      right person?

        Reese appraises her coldly.

                                REESE

                      I'm sure.

                                SARAH

                      Come on, me? The mother

                      of the future?  Am I tough?

                      Organized?  I can't even balance

                      my checkbook.  I cry when I see

                      a cat that's been run over...

                      and I don't even like cats.

        She pulls the bandage tight with a knot.

                                REESE

                      Ow!  No, it's okay.  It's

                      better tight.

                                SARAH

                      And anyway, what do I know

                      about guerrilla warfare?

                                REESE

                      You'll learn.

                                SARAH

                           (angry)

                      Look, Reese, I didn't ask for

                      this honor and I don't want it.

                      Any of it.

                                REESE

                      John gave me a message for

                      you.  Made me memorize it.

                      'Sarah"...this is the message...

                      'Sarah, thank you.  For your

                      courage through the dark years.

                      I can't help you with what you

                      must soon face, except to tell

                      you that the future is not set...

                      there is no such thing as Fate,

                      but what we make for ourselves

                      by our own will.  You must be

                      stronger than you imagine you

                      can be.  You must survive, or I

                      will never exist.'  That's all.

        Sarah stares at him as the enormity of it all becomes real

        to her.  Reese moves his arm, testing the bandage.

                                REESE

                           (continuing)

                      Good field-dressing.

                                SARAH

                           (brightening)

                      You like it?  It's my first.

        He rebuttons his shirt and they return to the warmth-

        conserving embrace.  Sarah gazes out the entrance, into

        the night.

                                REESE

                      Sleep.  It'll be light soon.

                                SARAH

                           (closing her

                           eyes)

                      Okay.  Talk some more.

                                REESE

                      About what?

                                SARAH

                           (murmuring)

                      About where you're from.

        Kyle watches the helicopter circling far in the distance.

                                REESE

                      Alright.

                           (pause)

                      You stay down by day, but at

                      night you can move around.

                      The H-K's use infra-red so you

                      still have to watch out.

                      But they're not too bright.

                      John taught us ways to dust them

                      them.  That's when the infiltra-

                      tors started to appear.  The

                      Terminators were the newest,

                      the worst...

        During his monologue we have PANNED into the darkness outside

        and to the helicopter, which flies OUT OF FRAME, leaving

        black.  A ROTOR ROAR fades up.

                                               CUT IN BLACK TO:

183/FX  EXT. CITY RUINS, 2029 - NIGHT                          183/FX

        Black sky.  Stars.

        With a roar an AERIAL PATROL CRAFT enters close overhead.

        It has flashing red and blue lights and powerful search-

        lights which stab down.

        TILT DOWN

        to a vista of moonlit devastation.

        White ash blows in drifts among fire-gutted ruins.

        Blackened bones lie everywhere in heaps.

        Searchlights sweep the night.

        Another aerial unit hovers several blocks away, firing

        tracers into the ruins.

                                               CUT TO:

184/FX  EXT. RUINS/STREET - NIGHT                              184/FX

        LOW ANGLE

        as a gleaming chrome H-K grinds through the debris of the

        shattered street on its tank-like tracks, crushing burnt

        skulls.

        Its head turns slowly, playing high-intensity lights over the

        buildings.

        Its hydraulic arms are folded, mantis-like, against its

        'torso'.  After it passes a number of human figures dart

        from shadow to shadow, B.G.

185     INT. TUNNELS - NIGHT                                   185

        Reese is among a SQUAD OF MEN in black fatigues, carrying

        equipment and energy rifles, who enter a debris-littered

        tunnel.

        PANAGLIDE WITH THEM as they trot through a labyrinth of

        tunnels, pass several guard-posts.  Reese has a GERMAN

        SHEPHERD on a short leash.

                                               CUT TO:

186     INT. PARKING STRUCTURE - NIGHT                         186

        The platoon enters a cavernous chamber, an old parking

        structure, in which a large group is gathering.

        As the entrance, ARMED SENTRIES with dogs are passing in

        new arrivals: men wearing mismatched uniforms or rags and

        carrying all types of weapons from lasers to shotguns.

        Weapons are left at the sentry post.

        FOLLOWING REESE as he patrols the perimeter.

        He walks along a row of CARS, models from the eighties and

        nineties, now stripped, rusty and modified to carry weapons.

        There are conventional military vehicles as well.

        He passes several family groups.

        Gaunt kids are huddles around an old TV SET.

        Its glow bathes them.

        REVERSE ANGLE reveals that the set has been gutted and a

        small cookfire crackles inside the shell.

        Nearby a kid has a LARGE RAT cornered and is whacking it

        with a stick.

        Reese pauses at the end of the row of vehicles and unsnaps

        a pocket in his tunic, removing a small paper rectangle,

        a worn photograph.

        C.U. - REESE, gazing down.  His head snaps around at the

        sudden sound of BARKING.

        ANGLE ON SENTRY POST as the dogs go crazy.

                                SENTRY

                           (shouting)

                      Terminator!

        An innocuous, RAG-DRESSED MAN flips back his poncho to

        reveal a powerful PLASMA-RIFLE.  He opens FIRE, running

        forward.  ENERGY BOLTS rip into the crowd.

        MOVING WITH REESE, running toward the Terminator.

        RAPID CUTS:

        POWERBOLTS EXPLODE among the fleeing people.

        Beams sear the darkness.

        A running CHILD is BURST by a plasma hit.

        ANGLE ON REESE running.  He levels his energy-rifle and

        starts firing.  A powerbolt grazes his cheek, EXPLODING

        a support column behind him.  Part of the ROOF COLLAPSES

        as Reese tumbles.

        Everything is lit as if by lightning.

        C.U. - REESE, semi-conscious.  Burned.  Bleeding.

        Impressions implode on him: running feet, flashes, energy

        beams raking the ground leaving molten worm-tracks, scream-

        ing, a burning dog howling.

        DETAIL - The picture Reese has been looking at has fallen,

        forgotten.  It catches fire and starts to curl.  Before

        the image vanishes we see that it is a picture of Sarah.

        Reese looks up.

        A figure looms above, a silhouette in the smoky, hellish

        glare.  THE TERMINATOR.  Its  eyes glow red.

        A brilliant EXPLOSION WHITES OUT THE SCREEN.

                                               CUT TO:

187     INT. CULVERT - DAWN                                    187

        C.U. - SARAH, brightly lit by daylight.  Asleep.  She grimaces

        and groans.

        In the distance a dog is barking.

        Reese, still holding her, lightly lifts her hair from her

        face.  An uncharacteristically tender gesture.  He gently

        caresses her cheek with the backs of his fingers.  When

        she awakens suddenly he snaps his hand away.

        Sarah looks around, momentarily disoriented.  Looks up at

        Reese.

                                SARAH

                      I was dreaming about dogs.

        Reese extricates himself from her and steps out of the

        culvert.

                                REESE

                      We used them to spot Terminators.

        Sarah groans as she straightens her legs.

                                SARAH

                      Your world...it's pretty

                      terrifying.

189     EXT. HIGHWAY - DAWN                                    189

        Sarah catches up to him just as he is about to try and

        stop an approaching car.  She pulls his gun hand down with

        both of hers.

                                SARAH

                      Put that away.  I'll get one.

        She hold out her thumb to passing traffic.

        Reese watches this incomprehensible ceremony skeptically.

                                SARAH

                           (continuing)

        Reese and Sarah are crammed into the cab of a beat-to-hell

        PICKUP TRUCK with the DRIVER, obviously a surfer.  Laid-

        back, long-haired and well-tanned.

        Reese glowers and watches the scenery through slitted eyes.

                                DRIVER

                      ...and when it breaks right

        They pull off the highway toward a gas station/rest area.

190     EXT. SERVICE STATION - DAY                             190

        The gas station is like an oasis of clutter in a rolling

        stretch of meadows and woods.  It consists of a bunker-

        like building with restrooms and a flanking PICNIC AREA,

        beyond which are WOODS.

        People sit under the trees, enjoying the beautiful day

        while children tear around after the forced inactivity of

        a long trip.

        The three of them get out on unsteady legs.

                                DRIVER

                      You can still ride if

                                SARAH

                      Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.

        She heads for the WOMEN'S RESTROOM and Kyle follows her

        inside.

                                REESE

                           (pushing him out)

                      Yours is over there.

        Instead of following her directions to the Men's Room,

        Kyle wanders toward the drinking fountain.  A bunch of

        kids are running around and throwing water at each other

        with paper cups.

        Reese shambles through them like a zombie.

        He stands among the children, an alien in this land without

        fear.  He watches people at picnic tables laughing and

        listening to portable music.  Kids squeal.  Dogs bark.

                                LITTLE GIRL (V.O.)

                      Can you get my balloon?

        DOWN ANGLE on an achingly beautiful LITTLE GIRL of about

        four.  She points above his head.

        Reese looks up to see a helium-filled mylar balloon stuck in

        the foliage of a tree just above him.  He pulls it down by

        the string and holds it, turning it over dully.

        He crouches down to her eye-level.  She smiles.

                                REESE

                      Aren't you afraid to be out in

                      the open like this?

                                LITTLE GIRL

                      Huh?

        Reese whirls reflexively at a SCREAM behind him.  The

        mylar balloon bursts in his tense hands.  A teenage girl

        is being doused with water by the boys with plastic jugs.

        The little girl looks at the broken balloon, then glares

        at Reese.  She punches him soundly on the shoulder and

        storms off.

        At this moment she is bowled over by an IRISH SETTER that

        licks her face while she shrieks with laughter.

        Reese seems about to smile but doesn't quite know how to

        go about it.

        Sarah has been idly leafing through the DIRECTORY.  On

        a whim she looks up something.

        She freezes for a moment when she finds the listing.

        Then with a triumphant expression she rips the page out

        of the book.

        It reads:

        completely.

        PANNING WITH SARAH

        as she runs down the path.

        Reese tackles her from behind and they fall together in

        the long spring grass.

        She struggles violently to get away.

                                SARAH

                      Let...go...bastard...

        She gets one arm free and whacks him hard in the face.

        Reese reacts instinctively, leaping back in a defensive

        crouch.  Sarah freezes when she sees the .357 in his

        hand.

                      brilliant.

        Reese is trembling as he lowers the gun.

        Sarah too is shaking with emotion.  Tears roll down her

        cheeks and her voice cracks.

        Reese doesn't respond.

        The gun slips from his fingers.

        His will seems to drain from him and he sags to his knees.

        The moment stretches.

        There is only the sunlight moving in shafts through the

        leaves, the sound of a small stream nearby, birds chirping.

        Sarah puts her arm around him.

        She sniffs and wipes at her nose with the back of her hand.

                                SARAH

                      We can change it, Kyle.  We

                      have to try.

        She takes his shoulder in her hands.

        A patch of SCALP is blown away, revealing CHROME underneath.

        A flap of skin dangles from his cheek, which exposes some

        of the DRIVE CABLES which move the lips.

        He is scanning Sarah's address book, turning a page every

        two seconds.

        GANGRENOUS in places.  He ignores the FEW FLIES crawling

        on his face.

        heading back to the Interstate.  The driver answers her wave

        out the side window.  Reese stops for a moment outside the

        motel office to pet a GERMAN SHEPHERD sitting on the porch.

        The dog wags its tail and licks his hand.

        She takes it without thinking as he leaves then realizes

        that she has A LOADED GUN IN HER HAND, without the slightest

        idea of how to use it.  She lays it gently on the dresser.

        As an afterthought, she turns it with one finger so that it

        is pointing the other way.

        out for her hand and it seems he may be taking it to

        comfort her.

                                REESE

                      Probably.  Sarah, if I get

                      zeroed...

                                SARAH

                      Don't say that.

                                REESE

                      If I do, you have to get away,

                      disappear without a trace.

                      Different country, different

                      name, everything.  In case they

                      send another one.

                                SARAH

                      It'll never be over, will it?

                      Look at me, I'm shaking.

                      Some legend, huh?  You must

                      be pretty disappointed.

                                REESE

                      No.  I'm not.

        Several beats before Sarah speaks again.  Her eyes seem

        luminous in the dark.

                                SARAH

                           (softly)

                      Kyle, the women in your

                      time...what were they like?

                                REESE

                      Good fighters.

                                SARAH

                      That's not what I meant.

                      Was there someone special?

                                REESE

                      Someone?

                                SARAH

                      A girl.  You know.

                                REESE

                           (mechanically)

                      No.

                           (pause)

                      Never.

        He looks away, outside the window

                                SARAH

                           (softly)

                      I'm sorry.

        Sarah studies him for a moment.

        She's sitting slightly behind him and she puts her hands

        on his shoulders and back, tracing the lines of his scars

        with her fingertips.

                                SARAH

                      So much pain.

                                REESE

                      Pain can be controlled.

                      You disconnect it.

                                SARAH

                      And so you feel nothing.

                                REESE

                      It's better that way.

                                SARAH

                           (with great

                           sympathy)

                      Oh, Kyle.

        Reese takes a long, slow breath before he answers, and when

        he does his voice has a new quality, an unfamiliar tenderness.

                                REESE

                      John Connor gave me a picture

                      of you once.  I never knew

                      why.  It was very old. Torn.

                      Faded.  You were young, like

                      you are now.  You weren't

                      smiling...just a little sad...

                      I always wondered what you

                      were thinking at that second.

        He closes his eyes, reaches toward her.  His fingertips

        trace the contour of her nose, chin, cheeks.

                                REESE

                           (continuing)

                      I memorized every line, every

                      curve...

        He opens his eyes, looking right at hers.

                                REESE

                           (continuing)

                      Sarah, I came across time

                      for you.  I love you.

                      I always have.

        Sarah is quietly overwhelmed.

        Reese looks away.

                                REESE

                           (continuing)

                      I'm sorry.  I shouldn't

                      have said...

                                SARAH

                      Kyle...

        She leans forward and kisses him.

        His face is frozen.  A mask.

        She continues, tenderly.

        He begins to respond.

        The dam breaks and he holds her in a tight, trembling

        embrace, clinging to her like life itself.

        Kyle picks her up and carries her to the bed.

        She kisses his neck and chest, tracing his scars with

        her lips.

        He unbuttons her blouse very slowly.

        Sarah guides his powerful hands over her.

        A SEQUENCE OF CUTS.  DETAILS.  IMPRESSIONS.

        Sarah, a very close angle, as she grimaces in divine agony.

        Reese, his face rapt.

        His hand, clutching the pillow as if to kill it.

        It is explosive, torrential.  A confluence of fate and will.

                                               CUT TO:

212     INT. MOTEL ROOM/LATER - NIGHT                          212

        TIGHT ON SARAH AND REESE in each other's arms.  Lying

        across his chest, she surveys his face as his eyes close

        drowsily.

                                SARAH

                      I bet you're ticklish.

                           hending)

                      Ticklish?

        Sarah's hand moves OUT OF FRAME.  After a moment Reese

        looks down, puzzled.

                                REESE

                      What are you doing?

                                SARAH

                           (continuing

                           doggedly)

                      You'll beg for mercy in

                      a second.

        Reese seems unperturbed.  Finally he begins to squirm.

                                REESE

                      I don't think I like this.

                                SARAH

                      You're not supposed to.

        Now Reese is becoming desperate.  A grimace spreads across

        his face.  It becomes a grin.  Then he's laughing, trying

        to escape but she won't let him, and they collapse, laughing

        together.

        Sarah gazes at his grin, a glimpse of the Reese that might

        have been, in another life.

        A moment later the grin vanishes at the sound of dogs barking

        outside.

        Reese is off the bed in an instant, crouched tense, eyes

        alert.  Feral as ever.

                                REESE

        as a lunar landscape.  PAN OFF the lunging dog to the row

        of rooms facing the parking lot.

        HANDHELD as we approach the doors.

        It is WIDE ANGLE and the barrel of the AR-180 is visible at

        the bottom of FRAME.

        The nearest vehicle parked in front is a LARGE PICKUP TRUCK

        WITH TWO DIRT BIKES lashed in the bed, seen prominently as

        The POV approaches a door.  Number 14.

        The door is KICKED OPEN.

        Moving inside.

        The assault rifle sprays the room, exploding the indistinct

        forms on the bed.  Staccato glare.  Approaching the bed.

        Nothing there put the shredded remain of sheets and pillows.

        The POV shifts to the BACK DOOR, which is ajar, and moves

        toward it.  Through the door.  Revealing an EMPTY YARD.

        Sarah lies on the seat, clutching the nylon satchel, which

        bulges with the explosive charges.  She has dressed hastily

        and is barefoot.

                      Light it now.

        Sarah has been holding a BIC LIGHTER near the tip of a fuse.

        the wires and the engine starts to turn over.

        FAST PANAGLIDE WITH HIM as he runs the

        length of the suite, stops outside the front door.

        Whips the AR to his shoulder.

        The truck is BACKING WILDLY across the lot B.G.

        Terminator turns, looking into CAMERA as a SIZZLING SOUND

        becomes audible.

        DETAIL - PIPE CHARGE, lying just inside the door, in the

        shadows.  The fuse is burning.

        WIDE SHOT - On doorway, from the parking lot, as Terminator

        takes two leaping strides forward and the CHARGE EXPLODES.

        The front of the building is BLOWN TO KINDLING.

        Terminator is flung forward by the blast.

        18-wheelers.  The truck tops out at 110 and he holds it.

        They flicker rapidly through pools of light and shadow.

        ANGLE OVER REESE'S SHOULDER as they hurtle forward.  An

        interchange flashes by in an instant.

        tucked, getting as much speed as possible out of the 750.

        the pickup, B.G.  The truck swerves suddenly, diving around

        a TRACTOR-TRAILER.  Terminator leans hard to follow.

        LOW WIDE ANGLE preceding the pickup and Terminator as they

        swerve as high speed.  Reese uses the slow semis as static

        obstacles.  He misses them by inches, TIRES SQUEALING.

        ANGLE OVER SARAH'S SHOULDER, through the front window as

        the back of a SEMI-TRAILER hurtles toward them, straight ahead.

        HIGH ANGLE, following both vehicles as Reese feints RIGHT

        and then skids LEFT.  He slides toward the trailer in a

        FOUR-WHEEL DRIFT as Terminator commits to the right.

        M.C.U. - TERMINATOR, over the barrel of the AR, as he FIRES.

        SIDE ANGLE - PASSING TRUCK-TRAILER, bullets strafe across

        it as the pickup vanishes behind.  Terminator skids the

        bike, barely missing an abutment, and is forced onto an

        OFF-RAMP.

        LOW SIDE ANGLE preceding Terminator as he roars down the

        off-ramp without slowing.  Runs the red light at the bottom

        as a hundred miles an hour.  Climbs the ON-RAMP.

        handed.  He FIRES.  ONCE.  TWICE.  AGAIN.

        They enter an interchange.  Ahead lies a LONG, SWEEPING

        CURVE, two lanes wide and elevated.

        Terminator rocks back from a round between the eyes that

        bares metal, the FIRES.

        Bullets rake the pickup.

        The windows are blown out.

        The side mirror explodes.

        Reese is hit.  Drops the .357.

        Sarah screams and weaves, barely in control.

                      Kyle...oh God...

        He has a bullet in the chest.  Another has broken his arm.

        He FIRES.

        Sarah shrieks as the doorpost next to her head CLANGS WITH

        HITS.

        The short burst EMPTIES THE GUN.

        It CLATTERS TO THE PAVEMENT a moment later, discarded.

        Terminator draws the .38.  Takes aim.

        Sarah SCREAMS.  HITS THE BREAKS HARD.  CRANKS THE WHEEL.

        GLASS behind her EXPLODES with gunfire.

        SWERVING VICIOUSLY the truck SLAMS THE BIKE, sending it

        FLYING INTO A GUARDRAIL.  Terminator goes over the handle

        bars at a hundred miles per hour.

        Terminator hits the pavement, tumbling, rolling, sliding

        with a CHATTERING SCREECH and spraying sheets of SPARKS

        as flesh strips away and steel screams on concrete.

        The pickup SWAPS ENDS violently, smashing into the guardrail.

        Terminator hits the guardrail, bounces up, tumbles along the

        top and then pitches OUT INTO SPACE.

        lies there, face-down.  Still.

        Sarah is slammed hard as the truck grinds to a stop against

        the guardrail.  She checks Kyle.  He is barely conscious.

        Sarah heaves open the door.  Runs to the guardrail. Looks down.

        LOW ANGLE as he rises into FRAME, a mass of blood.  Clothing

        and skin in tatters.

        HEADLIGHTS FLARE behind him and an AIRHORN BLARES.

        FULL SHOT as a DOUBLE-TRAILER KENWORTH GASOLINE TANKER smashes

        him down and under with a METALLIC CRASH.

        ANGLE UNDER TANKER as Terminator rolls, clattering, and the

        mass blurs above him.  He RICOCHETS between the pavement and

        the speeding undercarriage until a stray bounce flings him

        up into the rear suspension.

                     Don't stop.

        They lock eyes for a moment.

        Terminator clings with inhuman strength to the rear suspen-

        Beneath the braking  semi, Terminator CRAWLS UPSIDE DOWN,

        hand over hand like a HUMAN FLY, toward CAMERA.  The

        left eye GLOWS LIKE A COAL in the dark.  As the pavement

        stops beneath him he drops off and rolls out from under

        the truck.

        The driver looks around in astonishment as his door is

        ripped open.

        Terminator appears.  A grisly apparition.

        FLINGS THE DRIVER OUT and takes his place behind the wheel.

        Ignoring the terrified partner, he examines the controls.

        From the railing Sarah sees the tanker below as

        a body falls beside it, rolling.

        The truck swings in a slow arc.

        TEARS THROUGH THE DIVIDING FENCE.

        Heads back toward her on the wrong side of the freeway.

        She stares in numb horror.

        The nightmare refuses to end.

        She runs to the crippled pickup and sees a front tire flat,

        shredded by a crumpled fender.

        She searches the cab frantically for the KEYS TO THE

        MOTORCYCLES.  Finds them above the sun visor.

        Sarah leaps into the bed of the pickup and attacks the

        motorcycle strap-downs frantically.

        Panting with terror she rolls the bike off the truck.

        It crashes on its side and she falls on it painfully.

        Straining until she CRIES OUT INVOLUNTARILY, she lifts

        it upright.

        KICKS the engine over.

        LOW ANGLE

        as the tanker crashes back through the divider and starts

        UP THE OVERPASS.  Sarah is trapped in that concrete corridor.

        She kicks for her life.

        The bike catches for a moment.  Dies.

        The truck BELLOWS, down-shifting on the curving grade.

        Sarah kicks again and again, crying out with each stroke.

        Again and again, furiously.

        The engine CATCHES.

                                SARAH

                           (rapidly)

                     Come on, come on, come on

                     ...run, you...

        The bike runs with a healthy roar.

        LOW ANGLE

        up the face of the tractor-trailer, the retaining wall blur-

        ring by.  Terminator's red eye can be seen through the wind-

        shield.

        Sarah drags Reese, stumbling,to the bike, props him on the

        seat behind her.  He clutches the satchel weakly.

                                SARAH

                     Hold on real tight, okay?

        She guns the engine and roars off.

        LOW ANGLE

        as the tanker demolishes the pickup a moment later, TOSSING

        IT OVER THE SIDE LIKE A BEER CAN.

        tanker, distant B.G., but the little bike is overloaded

        and she can't coax it above seventy-five.

        ANGLE ON TANKER roaring forward, shifting up through

        the gears.

        CLOSE ON SARAH AND KYLE, his head lolling on her shoulder.

        He starts to fall sideways.

                                SARAH

                           (shouting)

                     Hold on, goddamnit!

        He rouses slightly, gripping her tighter.

        HIGH ANGLE - MOVING WITH BOTH VEHICLES as Sarah starts to

        ZIGZAG desperately across all four lanes.  The truck stays

        with her, closing, its trailer WHIPLASHING VIOLENTLY.

        A half-mile of exitless concrete and strobing fluorescent

        lights.

        M.C.U. - SARAH AND KYLE (PROCESS SHOT) - He blinks and looks

        back at a SOLID WALL OF METAL AND LIGHTS looming behind them.

        Sarah hunches down.  They hit eighty.

        FULL SHOT - The leviathan dwarfs them, its big tires ROARING

        like the hubs of Hell.

        tunnel.  Sarah dodges to one side and LOCKS THE BRAKES.

        The bike slides, fish-tailing.

        The truck roars past, hitting the air-brakes.

        The trailers force her closer and closer  to the guardrail

        as Terminator tries to sandwich her.

        The bike slides to a stop.

        The rearmost set of trailer wheels slams into the guardrail

        right in front of Sarah.

        Sarah emerges from a cloud of tire smoke, cutting across

        all four lances behind the stopped semi.

        control, spilling the bike.  She and Kyle tumble down

        the slope.

        MOVING WITH HER as she scrambles, half-dragging Kyle, through

        a row of trees at a chainlink retaining fence.  She crawls

        under the fence, tugs Kyle and the satchel through after.

        Sarah looks up at the source of a SUDDEN THUNDEROUS ROAR.

        of a MODERN FACTORY COMPLEX of LOW BUILDINGS.  Kyle struggles

        to keep up, holding the satchel.

        LIKE A JUGGERNAUT the truck follows, smashing through parked

        cars and FLATTENING A PRE-FAB STORAGE BUILDING.

        They enter an alley-like space between two buildings.

        Kyle is fumbling to open the satchel.

        ANGLE BACK as the tanker enters the alley.  It TEARS THE

        CORNER OFF ONE BUILDING as it turns in.  Terminator looks

        down from his mountain of steel.

        of clearance as the trailers pass by.

        He lights a PIPE CHARGE, jumps up and wedges it under the

        tank-cylinder of the second trailer.

        He ducks as it rolls on.

        Sarah is stumbling in the glare of the truck's lights.

        E.C.U. - PIPE BOMB, the fuse burning.

        The dumpster is enveloped by fire and hurled, rolling, down

        the alley.

        Sarah makes it around a corner as the FORWARD TRAILER

        EXPLODES and an OCEAN OF FLAME rolls forward, blasting by her.

        The dumpster topples and Kyle rolls out, surrounded by fire.

        In the center of the inferno Terminator struggles violently.

        His FLESH FIRES AND SIZZLES.  He tears loose from the

        TWISTED WRECKAGE and collapses to the ground.  Sinks into

        a CHARRED MASS.  STOPS MOVING.

        C.U. - TERMINATOR, mouth open, skull-like, motionless

        She sees Kyle crumpled face-down near the dumpster, sheltered

        from the heat by its mass.

        She drags his away.  Rolls him over.

        C.U. - REESE, his head lolls.  He opens his eyes

                                REESE

                           (weakly)

        It would be a wonderful final image.

        Except...TERMINATOR STAGGERS OUT OF THE BLAZE BEHIND THEM.

        M.C.U. - TERMINATOR, the last flakes of flesh are falling

        from him like burning leaves.  His gleaming structure is

        revealed in all its intricacy.  No longer a 'He', but an 'It'.

        It looks like Death rendered in steel.

        A CHROME SKELETON with HYDRAULIC MUSCLES and TENDONS OF

        FLEXIBLE CABLE.  In the sockets of the metal skull, the

        eyeball swivels with a WHIR of tiny servos, both glowing

        red now.

        It turns slowly and fixes its gaze directly INTO CAMERA.

        dragging one MALFUNCTIONING LEG.

        PANAGLIDE WITH KYLE AND SARAH as they stagger to their feet

        and run to the nearest building.  They come to a glass door.

        Kyle kicks it in.  Unlatches it.  They enter dark OFFICES

        to the sound of ALARMS and DISTANT SIRENS.

        Through a door, which they close and lock.

        They move off down a cross-corridor.

        The Terminator BLASTS THE DOOR OFF ITS HINGES, F.G., and

        staggers through.  It starts after their receding figures

        as they round the corner at the end of the hall.

        Flings desks out of the way.

        are acres of machinery in darkness.  Silence.

        CRASH!  The Terminator hits the door from the far side.

        Hinges SQUEAL.

        Kyle goes to a LARGE BREAKER PANEL and opens it.  Starts

        throwing switches.  Behind them, machines START UP ONE BY ONE.

                                SARAH

                           (panting)

                      What are you doing?

                                REESE

                           (weakly)

                      Cover...our footsteps...

        He sags, sliding down the wall.  She pulls him up.

        Half-carries him into the maze of machines.

        The dark gallery is filled with WHIRRING, CLANKING SHAPES,

        SHATTERING CONVEYER BELTS and improbable mechanisms lashing

        mindlessly.

        Reese slips to the floor and Sarah is no longer able to

        support him.

                                REESE

                           (faintly)

                      Leave me here.

        Sarah crouches beside him.

        Grabs his shirt front.

        Yells over the machines.

                                SARAH

                      I'm not leaving you anywhere

                      you jerk.  Haven't you figured

                      it out?  Kyle, John is our

                      son.

        Reese's eyes refocus.

                                SARAH

                           (continuing)

                      There isn't going to be

                      anybody else...I don't want

                      anybody else.  Listen to

                      me!

        She pauses, then resumes in a commanding, military shout.

                                SARAH

                           (continuing)

                      Move!  Reese! Let's go.

                      Move you ass!

        She drags him to his feet and he staggers on.

        Hinges SHATTER and the firedoor is hurled inward.

        The Terminator scans the darkness.

        ANGLE - PANNING WITH SARAH AND KYLE as they move through

        the machines.

        The cyborg steps forward, scanning methodically.

        Sarah and Kyle move in a crouch through the treacherous

        tangle of pipes and machinery.  Kyle picks up a length of

        pipe to use as a weapon.  As they climb out onto a cat-

        walk between the two huge mechanisms, Sarah clambers over

        an innocuous CONTROL PANEL.

        Her knee inadvertently hits a RED PUSH BUTTON.

        With a ROAR the stamping-plate of a HYDRAULIC PRESS slams

        down an inch from her hand.

        Startled, she tumbles to the catwalk.

        The Terminator's eyes swivel as he hears the single non-

        rhythmic sound.

        Kyle and Sarah run to the end of the catwalk, but find the

        door there locked.

                                SARAH

                      Come on!

        They double back to escape the cul-de-sac.  The Terminator

        steps in front of them, cutting them off.

                                REESE

                           (shouting)

                      Run!

        He pushes Sarah roughly and she stumbles away.

        Kyle raises the pipe with his good arm as the Terminator

        advances.

                                REESE

                           (over his

                           shoulder)

                     Run, damn it!

        She hesitates, backing away.

        The cyborg swings at Reese

        STEEL CLANGS ON STEEL.

        Kyle strikes and parries but is sledgehammered back.

        ANGLE ON CATWALK as Kyle lands in a heap, smashed against

        a stanchion of the railing which prevented him falling to

        the factory floor twenty feet below.

        Sarah turns and runs.

        LOW ANGLE PAST REESE, F.G., as the cyborg approaches him.

        E.C.U. - A FUSE BURNING.

        C.U. - KYLE'S FACE streaked with blood, pressed to the

        floor as a metal foot CLANGS DOWN, F.G.   His eyes snap open.

        Sarah falls, gets up, runs on.

        The Terminator draws back for a death blow.

        And Kyle rolls with the last of his strength, raising

        the pipe bomb he has been cradling.  He jams it between two

        hydraulic cylinders just beneath the cyborg's armored  rib-

        cage.  Then rolls off the catwalk.  Terminator has an instant

        to react, reaching for the bomb, before it EXPLODES.

        Sarah is pitched forward by the blast and slides on the

        floor.

        Slams up against one wall.

        A withering spray of shrapnel strafes the walls around her.

        Pieces of scrap metal clatter throughout the factory, rain-

        ing down.

        C.U. - SARAH, very still.  She winces and opens her eyes.

        Slowly looks up.

        POV - SARAH, as the smoke clears.  The Terminator is GONE.

        Unrecognizable clumps of BURNING DEBRIS lie scattered about.

        Looking down through the grating floor she sees Kyle's

        body.

        LOW ANGLE ON KYLE F.G., Sarah on catwalk above.  Kyle's eyes

        are half-open.  Still.  His face peaceful.

        ANGLE ON ONE OF THE FIRES climbing some plastic tubing and

        triggering a SPRINKLER HEAD.  It begins to rain.

        C.U. - SARAH sitting up as the water runs over her.

        She looks down.  Protruding from her right thigh is a TWISTED

        PIECE OF METAL.  Shrapnel.  Part of the cyborg.  She pulls

        it out, grimacing.  Her leg is broken.

        It is a long time before she can gather the will to move.

        SARAH'S POV - She sees a WALL PHONE several yards away,

        beyond the debris from the explosion.

        She starts to crawl toward it.

        She passes A LARGE CLUMP OF DEBRIS, F.G.

        ANGLE ON DEBRIS (FX) as it rolls over suddenly!

        Now recognizable as the TERMINATOR'S HEAD AND ARMS, with

        half of the scattered torso trailing wires and twisted

        metal.

        IT LUNGES FOR HER!

        Sarah wants to scream this time, from the depths of her

        soul, but there is no scream, only a dry shivering sob.

        The Terminator drags itself SCRAPING over the floor, steel

        fingers clutching.

        Sarah is shaking and whimpering as she scrabbles away,

        crawling in agony.

        ANGLE ON CONVEYOR BELT as Sarah flops from the catwalk

        onto the MOVING STRIP.  She is carried into the intricate

        lattice of equipment.  Sarah rolls off weakly before going

        under a set of sorting rollers.

        ANGLE THROUGH MACHINERY - ON THE TERMINATOR (FX) as it crawls

        after her, dragging its body.  It tracks her unerringly,

        EYES GLOWING.

        Sarah moves deeper into the DARK, CLASHING JUNGLE of machinery.

        Around her is a rain-drenched tangle of CABLES, PIPES and

        unforgiving mechanisms of steel.

        The Terminator clambers through after her.

        C.U. - SARAH - Water pours into her eyes as she catches

        sight of something.  A familiar CONTROL BOX.

        She drags herself toward it.

        C.U. - THE TERMINATOR (FX) - It spots her wedged in a tiny

        crawl space.  No way out.

        It crawls the last few feet,EYES RED IN THE DARK.

        Hypnotized, Sarah watches the Terminator REACHING TOWARD HER.

        She is jammed in a corner.

        Sarah's hand claws around to the front of the control panel,

        seeking the RED BUTTON.

        E.C.U. - HER WET FINGERTIPS FEEL THE BUTTON.

        ANGLE ON THE TERMINATOR (FX), his steel hand reaching out.

        E.C.U. - SARAH, her face inexplicably calm, eyes steady in

        that infinite instant.  She clenches her teeth to keep

        from screaming as she WAITS.

        The Terminator's hand reaches for her throat to crush

        the life out of her and end its long mission.

                                SARAH

                           (voice icy)

                      You're...terminated...fucker!

        E.C.U. - BUTTON, as her bloody finger stabs it down.

        FULL SHOT, showing how the cyborg has been led into the

        MAW OF THE HYDRAULIC PRESS.

        THE STAMPING PLATE THUNDERS DOWN!

        Tons of mechanical pressure flatten the Terminator's head

        and body like tin-foil.  The PRESS SCREAMS, jamming solid.

        Lightning snaps out in one brief blaze, leaping to surround-

        ing machinery, arcing to Sarah's wristwatch.  All the

        Terminator's energy is released in one second.

        ANGLE on the narrow gap between the upper and lower plates:

        a pinpoint of red light DWINDLES AND GOES OUT.

        TIGHT ON SARAH, shivering uncontrollably.  The steel fingers

        are frozen an inch from her throat.  She can only stare as

        water runs over her.

                                               CUT TO:

257     INT. FACTORY - DAWN                                    257

        CLOSE ON the side rail of an ambulance gurney SNAPPING UP

        into position.  Sarah's eyes are closed and she is moved

        OUT OF FRAME.

        WIDE SHOT, showing the gurney being rolled by TWO ATTENDANTS

        past the site of the last explosion.

        SEVERAL POLICE OFFICERS are picking through the debris.

        PANNING WITH THE GURNEY as it is wheeled out, holding on

        TWO FACTORY EMPLOYEES, F.G.

        One, the PLANT MANAGER, bends to examine a piece of the

        cyborg lying at the base of the hydraulic press.

        A COP, B.G., notices this.

                                COP

                      Look, I told you not to

                      touch anything until we're

                      done.  You got that?

                                MANAGER

                      Sure thing, officer.

        He stands and palms a small object to HIS ASSISTANT.  They

        step around the corner.

                                ASSISTANT

                      What is it?

                                MANAGER

                      Microcomputer chassis.  But

                      I've never seen stuff like

                      this anywhere.

                                ASSISTANT

                      Weird.  Jap stuff, maybe?

                                MANAGER

                      Keep it out of sight and

                      get it down to R and D

                      Monday, first thing.

                                ASSISTANT

                      Good idea.

                                               CUT TO:

258     EXT. BUILDING - DAWN                                   258

        Sarah is being lifted into the ambulance.  She looks

        up as the doors are latched shut.

        TILT UP to follow her gaze.

        The sign above the entrance of the building reads:

        CYBER DYNAMICS CORPORATION

                                               SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

259     INT./EXT. LANDROVER - LATE AFTERNOON                   259

        MACRO ON CASSETTE RECORDER, the center capstans of a

        tape turning.

                                SARAH (V.O.)

                      ...and the hardest thing is

                      deciding what I should tell

                      you and what not to.  Well,

                      anyway, I've got a while yet

                      before you're old enough to

                      understand the tapes.  They're

                      more for me at this point...

                      to help get it all straight.

        COVER SHOT reveals Sarah as the wheel of a dusty landrover

        parked at the pump island of a tiny gas station.  All of

        its signs are in hand-lettered Spanish.  Beyond lies an

        expanse of scrub desert.  The sky scowls with an impending

        storm.

        Sarah speaks quietly into a hand microphone as a dark-

        complected attendant laconically fills her tank.  She

        cradles the cassette recorder in her lap, in the lee of

        her SWOLLEN BELLY.

        She looks to be about SIX MONTHS ALONG.

        Under her down vest she wears a leather shoulder holster

        and the butt of a .357 REVOLVER presses against her

        breast.  She tugs the vest closed as the attendant glances

        her way.  A German Shepherd sits in the back among taped

        boxes and suitcases.

                                SARAH

                           (continuing)

                      Should I tell you about your

                      father?  That's a tough one.

                      Will it change your decision

                      to send him here...knowing?

                      But if you don't send Kyle,

                      you could never be.  God,

                      you can go crazy thinking

                      about all this...I suppose

                      I'll tell you...I owe him that.

                      And maybe it'll be enough if

                      you know that in the few hours

                      we had together we loved a

                      lifetime's worth...

        CLICK.  WHIR.  Sarah jumps at a sound nearby, breaking

        her reverie.  A small MEXICAN BOY has snapped her picture

        with a beat-up Polaroid camera.  He holds it out to her,

        speaking rapid Spanish.

                                ATTENDANT

                      He says you are very beautiful,

                      Senora, and he is ashamed to ask

                      five American dollars for this

                      picture, but if he does not,

                      his father will beat him.

                                SARAH

                      That's a pretty good hustle,

                      kid.  Four.  Quatro.

        The boy takes her four dollars and she watches the

        snapshot develop.  It is a good photograph of her,

        the wind lightly ruffling her hair, expression thought-

        ful, slightly sad.

        We recognize it as the one Reese carried in 2029.

        She slips it into her short pocket.

                                ATTENDANT

                      Mil trescientos...fifteen dollars

                      American.

        As she pays him, distant thunder rolls.

        The boy yells something in Spanish as he runs off.

                                SARAH

                      What did he say?

                                ATTENDANT

                           (accented)

                      There is a storm coming in.

        Sarah gazes at the thunderheads building up out over the

        desert.  Heat lightning pulses in their depths.

                                SARAH

                           (quietly)

                      I know.

        CAMERA CRANES UP as she pulls away, driving across the

        flat desert on a ribbon of highway.  A brilliant flash

        crescendos from horizon to horizon out at the rim of the

        world.
