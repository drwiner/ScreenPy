          Exile is not a material thing, it is a spiritual thing,

          all corners of the earth exactly the same. And anywhere

          one can dream is good, providing the place is obscure,

          and the horizon vast.

          1 EXT. TEHRAN, IRAN - MORNING 1

          The minarets of Shi'a mosques dot the skyline. The sun

          rises through the smog. Keening SIRENS call the faithful.

          A GROUP of bearded, turbanned MEN in white robes carrying

          Korans walk down an empty street.

          As the religious men pass a nondescript metal door, a

          THUMPING SOUND rises...

          The door cracks open and THREE MUSLIM WOMEN in full black

          sack emerge. The door shuts quickly behind them.

          Stay with the THREE MUSLIM WOMEN as they walk away. CLICK

          CLICK CLICK on the cobblestone. We hear GIGGLES.

          SUPERTITLE: TEHRAN, IRAN

          One of them reaches down and removes stiletto high-heels,

          which disappear under-the black cloth.

          2 INT. PRIVATE NIGHTCLUB - MORNING 2

          Down two flights of crowded stairs, there's a bar, dance

          floor, low couches, minimal lighting, wasted PEOPLE.

          Wealthy young IRANIANS sit at a table littered with ice-

          buckets and bottles of Absolut and Johnnie Walker.

          And with them is BOB BAER, 40's, professionally

          nondescript, he could be anything, a salesman, a high-

          school teacher. His face is ever-changing and his eyes

          miss nothing. Bob is the only American in the place and

          still you almost wouldn't notice him.

          ARASH AMIRI, 20's, a confident young Iranian, yells over

          the music. Beside him is his BROTHER.

                         ARASH AMIRI

          Have you ever tried liquid MDMA?

          Bob's forehead is sweating and his hair is sticking to

          it, which he wipes away as he sips his scotch.

                         BOB

          Liquid MDMA? No, I never tried it.

          The music is louder. Arash proudly shouts over it --

                         ARASH AMIRI

          Tehran is the world capital!

          Bob doesn't respond. Arash shouts again --

          ABASH AMIRI (CONT'D)

          So, how's the kid?

                         BOB

          Great. He's great.

          Arash just stares. Bob sips his drink.

                         BOB (CONT'D)

          Are we gonna do this?

          A girl begins to dance in front of Arash.

                         ABASH AMIRI

          After prayer --

          3 EXT. TEHRAN ROOFTOP - DAY 3

          DISTANT POV down to the street as TWO CARS pull up. Bob

          gets out of one, walks to the rear, opens the trunk --

          4 EXT. TEHRAN STREET - DAY 4

          The trunk SLAMS. Bob carries a worn ATTACHE CASE. The

          Amiris get out of their car, oblivious Shiite party boys.

          Bob walks, happy. Dour MEN at cafe tables miss nothing.

          5 INT. KEBAB SHOP - DAY 5

          Corrugated metal shutters CLOSE, sealing out the light.

          Arash ushers Bob through the gloom toward TWO MILITARY

          CASES. Bob expertly flips one over and opens it.

          Inside: A STINGER MISSILE, neatly disassembled. He finds

          the serial number: 3j16w4921.

          A SMILEY FACE is scratched into the metal of the Stinger.

          Bob tries to activate the Stinger. It's dead. Arash and

          his brother perspire. Bob is perspiring.

          Bob thinks he hears faint MOUTH BREATHING from behind the

          curtain closing off the rear of the shop.

          Bob opens HIS ATTACHE CASE. He removes a pouch. The pouch

          holds a battery. The battery has a serial number.

          Bob finds: 3j16w4921. A perfect match. He removes the

          dead battery and replaces it with the live battery. He

          activates the missile. It works. Everyone is relieved.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         3

                         5 CONTINUED: 5

          Bob moves to THE NEXT MILITARY CASE. He replaces the next

          battery and activates the second missile.

          Arash and his brother share a celebratory glance. Arash

          suddenly takes ONE CASE and drags it through the curtain.

          Bob hears LOW VOICES. He turns questioningly to Arash's

          brother who just stares and smiles like an idiot.

          Then Arash reappears, passing by Bob.

                         BOB

          You said they were both for you.

          Arash tosses an envelope at Bob --

                         ARASH AMIRI

          What do you care?

          Bob glances in the envelope. Behind him, the Amiris are

          picking up the other case. Bob moves toward the curtain.

          IN THE BACK OF THE SHOP Bob's eyes adjust. Several robed

          shapes, ghosts in grey light, carry the case out a door.

          The BARREL OF A GUN touches the side of Bob's head. The

          SOUND of a SHELL CHAMBERED and a MOUTH BREATHER.

          Bob raises his hands. The barrel slides around to his

          forehead and Bob is staring into the blue eyes of

          MOHAMMED SHEIK AGIZA, 40's, bearded, and calm.

                          BOB (FARSI)

          I was looking for the bathroom.

          MSA seems remarkably serene, then he screams in Arabic.

          BOB (FARSI) (CONT'D)

          You don't speak Farsi, do you, you

          son of a goat?

          MSA screams again, tightening his finger on the trigger,

          then he backs out the door, never losing aim on Bob.

          6 EXT. TEHRAN ROOFTOP - DAY 6

          The HIGH POV down to the street. The Amiris exit the

          kebab shop carrying the REMAINING MILITARY CASE.

          CAMERA ADJUSTS to incorporate SOMEONE'S HAND on the

          rooftop. And next to it, a remote-control TRIGGER DEVICE.

                         4

          7 EXT. TEHRAN STREET - DAY 7

          As the Amiris carry the case toward their car, Bob

          appears in the doorway and heads up the street toward us.

          Behind Bob, in the distance, the Amiris get into the car.

          Bob glances up at the roof and NODS ONCE, continuing to

          walk toward camera as --

          The car EXPLODES. Bob walks on as if nothing happened.

          8 INT. TEHRAN CAFE - DAY 8

          Tight on the game of Asteroids. The version from the

          70's. Black and white triangle "spaceship" spinning,

          shooting white dots at drifting "rocks," breaking them

          up, only to create more rocks.

          A hand rapidly hits the firing button. ROBBY BAER, 16,

          concentrates, hits hyper space, smiles, remembers he has

          a retainer, hides his smile.

          He glances over at a cafe table where Bob and MARGARET

          BAER, 40's, frank and guarded in a way that is

          compelling, are having morning coffee. We realize that

          all around them are IRANIANS, that a crowd is massing in

          the street outside, and that Bob clearly doesn't want to

          have this conversation.

                         MARGARET

          If you go back you get promoted.

          Which could open doors later. For

          consulting.

                         BOB

          Those people back there don't know

          what's going on. They don't wanna

          know.

                         MARGARET

          Have you thought about college?

          Has that made it onto the radar

          screen?

                         BOB

          And it's not like anybody else

          could roll in here. It's not like

          it's just reading reports.

                         MARGARET

          I took Pakistan because of the

          hardship pay. The private school

                         8 CONTINUED: 8

          Bob's expression, not unkind, but familiar to her, says

          he knows exactly why she took Pakistan.

                         MARGARET (CONT'D)

          I believe in what I'm doing, too.

          They look at each other.

                         BOB

          Well, then here we are.

                         MARGARET

          Here we are.

          In the street it's turning into a full-blown protest.

                         BOB

          Let's say, somehow, I get a Branch

          or even a Group, then what? Will

          you come? Will you bring Robby?

          Now, Margaret looks away. A STUDENT-LEADER is up on a

          platform brandishing a Coke bottle, SHOUTING in Farsi

          into a bullhorn.

                         MARGARET

          What's he saying?

                         BOB

          He's against the ban on Coca-Cola.

          He says you have to fix your soul,

          which is not something you can put

          on a soft-drink.

          We see the faces of the protesters, silently staring,

          their mouths covered by black tape.

                         CUT TO:

          9 INT. WOODMAN HOUSE - MORNING 9

          At a kitchen table, RILEY, almost 3, puts his hand in a

          bowl of dry Cheerios, squishes it around, then throws a

          handful on the floor.

          BRYAN (O.S.)

          You are a Cheerio dissemination

          device. Yes, you are --

          Pull back to find his father, BRYAN WOODMAN, American,

          late 20's, in a shirt and tie. Blonde and blue-eyed like

          a modern T.E. Lawrence, he's lost in the child, sharing

          his sense of wonder.

          Don't let him do that, please.

          His wife, JULIE WOODMAN, 28, sleepy American, very fit in

          sweats, cooks bacon at an older range. They have the

          worst house in the best neighborhood and have yet to

          properly furnish it.

          machine for the spreading of

          imported Cheerios to all corners

          of the kitchen.

          The toddler smiles at him. Julie puts four plates down.

          They both notice the empty place setting. Just then, a

          golden boy, MAX, 6, enters the kitchen.

                         MAX

          Mommy, I want bacon.

                         JULIE

          You have bacon.

          Max sits at the table.

                         MAX

          I want real bacon.

                         JULIE

          You have real bacon, only it's

          made from soy beans.

          Max looks at his plate.

          OIL EXECS. The LEADER eats ribs with tiny teeth.

                         BENNETT

          Are you a director or executive of

          this company?

          The leader gnaws on a bone. Bennett points down to a mess

          of contracts and legal papers in front of him.

                         BENNETT (CONT'D)

          Is this your fax number?

          The leader speaks rapidly in RUSSIAN. Bennett is baffled.

          Finally, an UNDERLING translates.

                         UNDERLING

          He says, we eat every part of the

          pony!

          Ask him if he's been receiving

          faxes'at this number? Ask him if

          this is his phone number?

          (to the leader)

          Is this a number to reach you?

          Again, the leader speaks in rapid Russian.

                         UNDERLING

          He says, the weather in Siberia is

          very cold!

                         BENNETT

          I'm asking you about this payment.

          Who is this person on the account?

          Bennett notices a Russian, OSKAR WERNER-TYPE, wearing

          THICK-FRAMED GLASSES, smoking and staring at him. Another

          RUSSIAN glances at the paperwork.

                         UNDERLING

          Bank is no more.

                         BENNETT

          I know bank is no more. I'm trying

          to find out where the assets went.

          The Russians nod to the MUSIC coming from the poles. Now

          the leader speaks in surprisingly good English.

                         LEADER

          This is marching music composed

          for Stalin. Inspiring for workers.

          The leader smiles at Bennett. It's a scary smile. The

          THICK-FRAMED GLASSES GUY is still staring.

                         LEADER (CONT'D)

          The investment dollar that matters

          is one that has army behind it. We

          are very good friend of United

          States. Who you want arguing for

          you in The Hague? Argentina?

          The leader spreads his arms expansively to take in the

          miles of empty tundra around them.

                         LEADER (CONT'D)

                         (PROUDLY)

          17 INT. CONNEX OIL BOARDROOM - DAY 17

           TOMMY (O.S.)

          You're not taking this seriously.

          You don't think this is a problem.

          One wall is a map of the world except where there should

          be jagged country boundaries are perfectly straight

          resource lines. It's color coded: the world divided into

          energy corporations: EXXON/MOBIL, BRITISH PETROLEUM,

          SHELL, CONNEX, KILLEEN, TOTAL, GAZPROM, LUKOIL...

          TOMMY (O.S.) (CONT'D)

          A U.S. Attorney is looking into

          your relationships in Kazakhstan

          and the U.S. Government is holding

          up approval of our merger...

          At one end of a long table in a corporate boardroom

          President TOMMY BARTON, 50's, a hatchet-man of Zen-like

          corporate efficiency, heads a group of EXECUTIVES. A

          small placard labels this faction - CONNEX.

          SUPERTITLE: CONNEX WORLD HEADQUARTERS - HOUSTON, TEXAS

                         TOMMY (CONT'D)

          The Board thinks it's a problem.

          Mr. Janus certainly thinks it's a

                         PROBLEM --

          JAMES "JIMMY" POPE, 50's, a powerful presence leavened by

          Connecticut minor chords, speaks from the far end where

          an opposing faction is labeled: KILLEEN.

                         JIMMY

          Is the Caspian a lake or a sea,

          Thomas?

                         TOMMY

          That's an important legal point --

                         JIMMY

          Oh give me another lecture on

          subsurface rights, Thomas.

          Jimmy stands. He is imposing in a Lyndon Johnson visits

          Congress sort of way.

                         JIMMY (CONT'D)

          If the Caspian is a sea, you can

          make deals with the Stans, but if

          it's a lake, then the rights are

          shared equally by all countries,

          including Iran. And by an act of

          our Congress it is illegal to

          trade with Iran, so we can't be in

          business with any of those

          countries, even though they have

          oil and we sell it. This is our

          business, Tommy, selling oil, not

          finding it. Anyone can find it.

          It's everywhere.

          Jimmy motions out the window --

                         JIMMY (CONT'D)

          A monkey can stick a straw in the

          ground, slurp it out and boil it,

          right, Thomas? But you wanna make

          it commercial, you wanna turn it

          into a commodity, then you gotta

          be able to move it and to move it,

          you gotta have relationships.

                         (BEAT)

          Take The Gulf --

                         TOMMY

          That's enough, Jimmy.

                         JIMMY

          No, I want to talk about The Gulf

          and how a goddamn E-mir, what is

          an E-mir anyway --

                         TOMMY

          King. It's a king --

                         JIMMY

          How some podunk King tossed you

          out on your ass.

          Jimmy pulls out a sharpie, walks to the Resource Map and

          defaces it, drawing the outline of an actual country,

          Kazakhstan, in Central Asia, home of the Tengiz Field.

                         JIMMY (CONT'D)

          Every company in the world wanted

          into Kazakhstan, into the Tengiz,

          but Killeen got it and then Connex

          wanted Killeen and here we are. I

          made investments. Investments that

          will bear fruit for this company.

          Hell, Tommy, we've all got the

          Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

          committed to memory. I've got a

          little copy taped to the wall of

          my head... Up here.

                         TOMMY

          Thank you, Jimmy. You know how

          much we appreciate hearing your

          point of view; however, Mr. Janus

          and I have asked Connex's

          Washington counsel, Sydney Hewitt,

          to come down here and talk about

          strategy for the next thirty days.

          The eyes all shift to SYDNEY HEWITT,. 60's, Alabama smooth

          accent and ever-so-certain.

                         SYDNEY

          In a way I feel like Switzerland

          and I'd like to remind everyone in

          this room that they've signed

          confidentiality agreements.

          Polite LAUGHTER.

                         SYDNEY (CONT'D)

          And allow me to introduce my

          associate, Bennett Holiday, who

          will be, how should I put it,

          building consensus day to day.

          Bennett, the only African-American in the room, takes in

          the faces now all staring at him. All the white faces.

          18 INT. PLANE - DAY 18

          POV of clouds and farmland and the Mississippi River.

          Sydney emerges from First with a scotch and sits.

          You just visited what someday soon

          could be the most profitable

          corporation in America.

                         BENNETT

          Provided the government approves

          the merger --

                         SYDNEY

          Provided we don't start running

          cars on water. Provided there's

          on your belt from your time over

          there - Enron, World Com - but now

          the job is find the problem, fix

          the problem. And if you don't find

          a problem, then there is no

          problem.

          Bennett notices that Sydney wears a Mickey Mouse watch.

                         SYDNEY (CONT'D)

          And WHEN the government approves

          this merger it's gonna buy a lot

          of houses out on the Vineyard,

          maybe even yours, so, of course,

          it's delicate all around. Who's

          this U.S. Attorney, Donald Farish

          the 3rd? What's his agenda? Who's

          behind him? Is it a political

          force? Another corporation? Is he

          a glory boy making a name?

                         BENNETT

          I know him. He taught a class of

          mine at Georgetown Law.

          Sydney knew this, of course. Sydney looks Bennett over,

          then he chuckles, the effect of which is unsettling.

                         SYDNEY

          Well, there you go, he taught a

          class of yours at Georgetown Law.

          Mr. .Whiting did say to me, I have

          a feeling about this young man. He

          said, he can position himself.

          Sydney stands.

                         SYDNEY (CONT'D)

          Hold these guys in a circle. Ask

          the careful questions. I don't

          need to tell you this is a hell of

          an opportunity for you to catch

          those peers who have spent, how

          should I put it, less time on the

          government dole.

          And get rid of that fancy watch,

          If oil goes to a hundred a barrel,

          the U.S. turns into a third-world

          I know that, Marilyn. In fact, we

          just pulled one of our officers

          out and I took the initiative to

          ask him to come down here. He

          infiltrated Hezbollah in Beirut in

          this. It's like the Godfather.

          Emir, I come to you on this

          special day. Vincent is riding

          motorcycles through Cambodia,

          through land-mines. Some charity

          thing.

                         JULIE

          That's guilt not charity. He's

          Catholic and can't view himself as

          a shallow model f.u.c.k.e.r, which

          he is. And when war breaks out in

          some energy producing country,

          he's the first one into work.

          Bryan looks at her.

                         JULIE (CONT'D)

          Honey... you're a man who supports

          his family, not a boy.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         BRYAN

          I thought you like him. Vincent.

                         JULIE

          I do, honey. For you, I like him

          very much.

          She takes his hand as they walk.

          VOICE (O.S.)

          Please, attention please, your

          host, his majesty, the Emir...

          ON A TV MONITOR: the Emir, HAMAD AL-SUBAAI, 60's,

          bearded, overweight, sitting in front of greenery, his

          TWO SONS behind him, addresses his party guests.

          EMIR (ON TV)

          It is my pleasure to personally

          welcome each of you to the Casa De

          Las Palmas, our oasis of palms in

          the south of Spain.

          38 INT. EMIR'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY 38

          The EMIR, his two sons, PRINCE MESHAL, late 20's, weak-

          chinned, effeminate, with longish hair, and PRINCE NASIR,

          30's, handsome, with large expressive eyes, close-cropped

          hair, powerful and serious, are across a table from

          CHINESE OIL EXECUTIVES.

          The Emir's PRERECORDED SPEECH drones on --

          EMIR (ON TV)

          And symbolic of the affection of

          my people for each of you. At nine

          o'clock, we will have wonderful

          music from the London

          Philharmonic. Please eat and

          socialize and enjoy.

          The Emir ignores himself on TV and turns to business. He

          recently had a stroke and was filmed from his good side.

                         EMIR (CONT'D)

          (a slight slurring)

          I am happy to welcome the Chinese

          to my country and optimistic you

          will not be nearly as greedy as

          the Americans.

          Assiduous nods from the CHINESE oil executives as the

          King's young Japanese SECRETARY slides contracts across.

          39 EXT. POOL PAVILION - DAY 39

          Bryan and Julie watch Max tentatively approach the pool.

          Nearby, Riley has introduced himself to an Arab family.

                         JULIE

          Arabs are very family oriented, as

          a people. Is that racist?

          Max, a book-oriented, rather than water-oriented, child

          is afraid to jump in.

                         BRYAN

                         (WATCHING-MAX)

          Not if what you're saying is

          positive.

          A bigger BOY fakes like he might push him in. Bryan

          starts to his feet --

                         JULIE

          Don't. Let him work this out. It's

          important for his autonomy.

          Max finds his courage, jumps, and disappears beneath the

          surface, then bobs up happily. Julie smiles.

                         BRYAN

          Hedge strategies are tough for

          these guys. Oil goes up the people

          wonder why those extra billions

          aren't in the treasury. Prices go

          down, no one's thanking them for

          saving a few bucks.

          Julie looks at her husband to determine whether he's

          testing his "pitch" or in need of encouragement.

                         JULIE

          Make a game of it. Pretend they're

          six year-olds and you have to get

          them to eat carrots and all they

          want is dessert. Make it about

          good parenting.

          40 INT. EMIR'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DUSK 40

                         EMIR

          The house is a Genius-Home. One of

          my sons had it wired by experts

          from the United States.

          The Emir sort of wilts, fading out. Prince Meshal foists

          a remote control on his father. The other son, Prince

          Nasir observes his father and brother.

          The Emir rouses. He presses a few buttons. The monitors

          show the estate: lawn; squash court; guard house.

                         PRINCE MESHAL

          watch...

          ON TV: the image of a rear guard house. Suddenly, the

          gate slides back, stops, slides the other way.

          CHINESE OIL EXECUTIVE

          Your Highness, that is incredible.

          (to Prince Nasir)

          Prince Nasir, isn't that amazing?

                         PRINCE NASIR

                         (DISMISSIVE)

          Fascinating.

          The Emir presses the remote. ON TV: seven swimming pools.

          Meshal proudly shares the moment with his father.

                         PRINCE MESHAL

          Oh, look, it's getting dark,

          better turn on the lights --

          ON SIX OF SEVEN MONITORS: pool lights turn on, shimmering

          turquoise. One pool remains dark.

          The Emir notices the dark pool. He presses the device.

          ON THE MONITOR: The lights go off. He presses again. Six

          pools light up, but one is still dark.

          The Emir ignores his son and speaks for the room.

                         EMIR

          Send a fool on a fool's errand.

          Meshal frantically tries to make the pool light come on.

          ON THE MONITOR: ONE IS STILL DARK --

          41 EXT. POOL SIDE - DUSK 41

          CHILDREN SCREAM, shouting, playing tag in the crepuscular

          light beside the dark pool. Max is among the children.

                         30

          42 EXT. UNDER WATER - DARK POOL - DUSK 42

          The SOUND of ELECTRICITY. We push toward a darkened pool

          light. The cover is cracked and the light is filled with

          water. Closer. Blue light arcs inside the cover. The

          SOUND of ELECTRICITY is LOUDER.

          43 INT. EMIR'S ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT 43

          Pictures of the Emir with Nixon, Carter, Ronald Reagan,

          Poppy Bush, Clinton, Bush II.

          TWO GULF BUSINESSMEN, reps of the Emir, appear and

          address Bryan who is waiting.

                         GULF BUSINESSMAN

          We regret that His Highness will

          be unable to see you. However, we

          are authorized to hear your

          proposition on his behalf.

                         BRYAN

          Here?

          They nod. Bryan looks around. It's awkward.

                         BRYAN (CONT'D)

          Well, okay... The real worry

          facing you guys is another year of

          record pricing. There are no more

          elephant fields. Not even in

          Natural Gas. As structural

          alternatives are more fully

          realized you'll need a new

          strategy to maximize every penny

          from your existing resources,

          particularly in a climate of

          falling prices.

          One businessman turns to the other --

          GULF BUSINESSMAN (ARABIC).

          There are two kinds of people in

          the world: those who control

          subsurface mineral rights and

          those who want to steal from them.

          Bryan didn't understand a word.

          44 EXT. POOL - DUSK 44

          The kids are organizing a game of "shark and minnows." An

          OLDER KID explains to Max --

          You're the shark and you try to

          tag us as we swim across.

          Max is uncertain, eyeing the dark water. From somewhere

          distant the LONDON PHILHARMONIC begins to play.

          OLDER KID (CONT'D)

          You jump in and count one, two,

          three, then we all try to get to

          the other side.

          Max stares at the dark water. It's not inviting. Finally,

          he jumps.

          He hits the water and goes rigid, almost skittering

          across the surface, flopping uncontrollably.

          45 EXT. ESTATE LAWN - NIGHT 45

          Bryan walks back across the lawn when SCREAMS come from

          the pool area ahead. Bryan hurries, then runs.

          46 EXT. POOL - NIGHT 46

          The VOLTAGE is audible as Max rolls onto his back,

          floating lifelessly. SECURITY prevent people from diving

          in. A bystander yells --

                         BYSTANDER

          Cut the power! Cut the power!

          Bryan enters the area. He sees Julie being restrained.

          And a body in the water.

          As the estate goes dark, Bryan dives and holds Max,

          wading to the side with the lifeless body.

          wall in the foreground. He wears his best clothes and

          looks freshly scrubbed as he picks his way along.

          He ducks down an alley, stops. Nervous, he catches his

          reflection in a shard of glass of a boarded-up window.

          You don't have to pay me. Let me

          show you how hard I work. And then

          decide whether to pay.

          For a moment it seems like this offer may win the day.

                         ABU KHALIFA

          I'm sorry. I already have a long

          list for that, too.

                         (GRUFF AGAIN)

          And if you want to work in this

          country, learn how to speak the

          turns to the officer, already apologizing, but Wasim

          steps between them. The cop pushes Wasim with his baton.

          Tough guy? Is that right, tough

          guy? What's your name, tough guy?

          Wasim doesn't say anything. Yunus watches his father and

          I've been airlifted out of foreign

          countries and I speak three

          languages because I have to.

          They'll feel sorry for me.

          An ADMISSIONS OFFICER signals to Robby who disappears

          through the door.

          56 INT. KEBAB RESTAURANT - DAY 56

          A college dive restaurant. The workers are all Lebanese

          immigrants. Bob and Robby eat at a small table.

                         ROBBY

          I know it's a year away but I'll

          have to have a car. A decent car.

          Nothing fancy, but it has to run.

          So I can get into Boston and New

          York. They have a great crew.

          That's what they told me. I said,

          crew of what? Ha, ha. They said,

          rowing. So...if I want to row...

          Bob quickly finishes a glass of cheap, white wine.

                         BOB

          Robby, you know, I live... Where

          do I live? Maryland. I live in

          Maryland. Meaning you have

          residency there. In Maryland. For

          the University. Of Maryland.

          Robby liberally uses the hot sauce. Two LEBANESE MEN at

          another table nod in approval. Robby fires off Arabic.

                         ROBBY (ARABIC)

          Lebanese is like Vanilla. You want

          hot, try Pakistan.

          The men can't believe this kid speaks Arabic. Robby turns

          back to Bob and says what's really on his mind.

                         ROBBY (CONT'D)

          I just want a normal senior year.

          I want to live in a normal house.

          I want Cinemax and prom. You know

          what prom is like in Pakistan?

          Prom sucks in Pakistan.

          Bob looks at his kid with love, the real thing.

          have really screwed up at work.

                         ROBBY

          How?

                         BOB

          I was supposed to keep my mouth

          shut and didn't.

          Robby is disappointed and angry.

                         ROBBY

          What does Mom do again that we

          have to live in Islamabad?

                         BOB

          She's a secretary.

          Robby turns back to the Arab men --

                          ROBBY (ARABIC)

           Both of my parents are

           professional liars.

           building. The FBI looms just down the street.

          58 INT. DONALD FARISH'S OFFICE - DAY 58

           DONALD FARISH III, 60's, longer hair than you would

          expect, talks on his cell phone, feet kicked up on the

          desk. Two Assistant U.S. ATTORNEYS stare at Bennett.

          FARISH (INTO PHONE)

          Hey, how bad is it? Ouch. When a

          Volvo dealer says that. Okay,

          you're honorable decent guys.

          Farish clicks off the cell phone, turns to Bennett.

          That's not good, kiddo. That's

          suffering quietly. Married? Kids?

          Bennett shakes his head. Farish looks him over like a

          good diagnostician inspecting a patient. Then --

                         FARISH (CONT'D)

          There is no way a company like

          Killeen pulled off a deal like

          this without paying somebody off.

          Bennett shrugs. Looks at the Assts. They don't smile.

                         BENNETT

          Why don't you tell me what you

          have so I can respond?

          Farish looks at his guys. They all choke back laughs.

                         FARISH

          I used to think something was

          wrong here. Now, I know

          something's wrong here.

          He stands, tall, imperious. Walks around his desk.

          Either you don't find anything

          because you don't know how to

          out and light you on fire.

          (to his guys)

          That's gotta be the play, right?

          Bennett doesn't say anything. Farish picks up a file,

          scans it: Bennett's particulars therein.

                         FARISH (CONT'D)

          You're so under-qualified it's

          laughable. Sydney Hewitt's new

          boy. How many of those have I

          59 INT. SQUASH COURT - DAY 59

          The SHARP SOUNDS of SQUASH. Looking through the opaque

          square of Plexiglas in the door to a squash court, Sydney

          and Bennett grunt and lunge and sweat.

                         SYDNEY

          I took a bit of a temperature

          reading. The other associates seem

          to like you. That's not really a

          good sign.

          I'm sorry, Sir.

          HIGH ANGLE - down to the fishbowl aspect of the court.

          Sydney has a very good serve. As they talk he wins three

          points in a row, Bennett lunging at the spinning ball.

          children will, and shimmies out of his dad's arms.

          Happy hour at a mall pub. Bob and STANLEY "STAN" GOFF,

          50's, moustache, glasses, windbreaker, ex-number three in

          CIA, smarter than he looks, drink beer and watch TV.

          How's Margaret? Divorced yet?

                         BOB

          We're not getting divorced.

          number three is the charm.

                         BOB

          My goal was always to own a bar in

          Macau, before Macau got ruined

          like everywhere else.

          There's nowhere left in the world

          to own a real bar, Bobby my boy,

          but I'll tell you one thing, you

          could quit right now, I'll get you

          hired back tomorrow as a. private

          consultant. You'll be doing the

          Bob and Stan drunkenly exit T.J. O'Toole's into the

          multiplex sign. FAMILIES and TEENAGERS stroll.

          private business is efficient.

          Is the Caspian a lake or a sea?

          A herd of zebra trots across a field and distant GUNSHOTS

          crack through the pine forest. This is a private game

          preserve, 10,000 acres of "conservation."

          Man, I mean to tell you, by the

          end, you got blood of lions,

          baboons, rhinos on your dungarees.

          Bennett, wearing an orange vest over his casual clothes,

          seems uneasy. Jimmy yells down to his friend.

                         JIMMY

          That's Kenya, Danny, not one of

          these turkey shoots.

          DANNY D.

          Bred animals kill, too, Jimmy.

          Jimmy continues his thought to Bennett.

                         JIMMY

          Fuck Connex. Fucking slant-

          drillers. Don't know why I ever

          sold 'em my company in the first

          place. Here, take your pick.

          He hands Bennett a thick catalogue.

          ANGLE ON CATALOGUE: Pages of animals you can shoot with

          pictures and description.

          ADDAX -- "this large African antelope is white with a

          gray masked face. It's horns corkscrew up making multiple

          twists in both sexes. Large males can weigh 275 lbs. Both

          males and females make handsome trophies.

          The Tengiz is the Holy Grail. You

          get into that stream, nobody in

          your family will ever have to

          clean a toilet again.

                         BENNETT

          Attorney has a source.

                         JIMMY

          Like somebody who didn't get into

          Tengiz and is pissed off about it.

          What's your fancy?

          Bennett randomly picks an animal from the list.

                         JIMMY (CONT'D)

          The Kudu. Good choice.

          (calling to driver)

          Floyd. Kudu.

          Bennett sees in the distance "Beater Boys," Mexican men

          in orange jackets, flushing quail for a party of hunters.

          I'm not sure --

                         JIMMY

          Jesus H. Christ. Kudu is rare. Get

          that gun up.

          Bennett lifts the rifle. THROUGH THE CROSS-HAIRS the Kudu

          is gigantic and unaware of the hunters.

           DANNY D. (O.S.)

          He's got 52 inch horns. Maybe 54.

          The Kudu looks at Bennett. An uncomfortable beat --

          JIMMY (O.S.)

          Come on, son. He won't wait all

          day.

          Finally Bennett PULLS THE TRIGGER. The gun is LOUD. He

          stares, then slowly pulls back from the scope.

          DANNY D. (O.S.)

          Lung shot. He's gonna run a bit.

          If you feel like Shee-iteing your

          The driver glances at Bob in the rearview.

          OUTSIDE a MAN has a gun stuck in his waistband. Another

          MAN on a roof has a rifle. A paranoid, guarded place.

          They turn and suddenly a metal gate is across the road.

          MEN pour out around the car. Flannel shirts, olive drab

          army shirts, beards, no beards, guns in waistbands.

          Bob's door is opened and he is yanked from the cab.

                         BOB (CONT'D)

          I'm here to see Said Hashimi.

          They roughly frisk Bob.

          Hashimi. Said Hashimi.

          They take his pen, remove his belt, check his passport:

          it's Canadian. Bob's picture. The name is SEYMOUR RISEN.

          They check his license: the name is SEYMOUR RISEN.

          Bob is pushed into another vehicle. Someone pulls bills

          from Bob's wallet and flips them to the cabbie.

          The gate rises. The car pulls away. The gate drops. The

          cabbie is left standing there holding the bills.

          Drab. Both have guns in their waistbands. They talk

          quietly, then laugh.

          Bob sits on a low couch. Opaque glass separates two rooms

          and shadows move behind it. SOMEONE offers Bob hot tea.

          A door opens and a man signals for Bob, who gets up,

          holding his pants.

          Bob sits in a high-back chair near Hashimi. The young men

          revere Hashimi and guard him carefully.

          I have a good feeling about

          American people, Bob. A good

          Thank you for this audience. I

          have a business proposal for

          Mussawi. One that benefits

          everyone.

          Hashimi nods magisterially.

                         SAID HASHIMI

          Mussawi is an energetic young man.

                         (BEAT)

          Your Arabic is very good.

          It's near dark in the room. The guards move nervously

          toward Bob and Said Hashimi.

                         BOB

          I thought it would also be prudent

          to say, I have no interest in

          Hezbollah. This is business and it

          doesn't concern Hezbollah.

          In the distance a dog barks and chickens cluck. After a

          beat, Hashimi turns his rheumy eyes on Bob.

                         HASHIMI

          If what you say is true, consider

          yourself welcome in Lebanon.

          The generator comes on with a distant WHIR. The lights

          come on. A man crosses to the air-conditioner, reaches up

          An ancient grotto where the early Christians used to

          hide, be discovered, and executed. A tourist attraction,

          it's a cool, vast, dimly lit, subterranean space.

          Bob reads a description of a stalactite formation. He is

          alone, waiting for someone. The grotto ECHOES.

          In the distance, TWO ARAB SCHOOL CHILDREN, playing with

          the echoes, do a little dance step and rap out, in broken

          English, a well-known American SONG.

                         MUSSAWI

          I gotta ask you one question. Amin

          Shehab... car accident?

          Bob turns to look at MUSSAWI, 30's, closely-shaved bullet

          head, seemingly good-natured, a businessman, he speaks

          English with a New Jersey accent.

                         BOB

          Yeah, sure. Only one of them was

          propelled by gas and the other by

          C-4.

          This settles a beat.

                         MUSSAWI

          Rumors of Bob, but never Bob. It

          is Bob, right? What is it you tell

          people you do these days, Bob?

                         BOB

          I'm between State Department and

          Defense.

          Bob surreptitiously looks around to see if Mussawi is

          alone. It's clear Bob makes him nervous as well.

                         MUSSAWI

          Just me, buddy, as requested.

          Bob reaches inside his jacket. Mussawi reaches in his.

                         BOB

          I'm getting some information,

          Jimmy.

                         MUSSAWI

          My name is Mussawi.

          Bob hands a picture to Mussawi.

                         BOB

          Okay, Jimmy.

          Mussawi glances down at the picture. It surprises him.

          ANGLE on the picture of PRINCE NASIR crossing a street.

          Bob has a small pad on which he scribbles a dollar

          figure. Mussawi glances at the number. He's impressed.

                         MUSSAWI

          He's traveling to Beirut. It's

          dangerous to travel. He'll

          disappear.

                         BOB

          I want you to drug him, put him in

          the front of a car and run a truck

          into it at fifty miles an hour.

                         MUSSAWI

          tents and sails a SUPPLICANT beseeches a favor from

          Prince Nasir who reads a newspaper and watches TV.

                         SUPPLICANT

          Your generosity is bigger than a

          mountain that shades us from the

          burning sun. I humbly ask for my

          citizenship expiry date to be

          extended.

          The Prince nods his assent. Across the deck Bryan sits

          with the PRINCESS AL-SUBAAI, 30, a Westernized young

          woman with dignity beyond her years.

          They watch as Nasir is served coffee by SERVANTS who make

          sure not to block his view of the financial news. The

          supplicants stare at the Princess.

                         PRINCESS AL-SUBAAI

          They hate me being here, dressed

          she's a medical doctor, she'll

          examine your children, but only

          without a veil.

          A SECRETARY checks a list and ushers another supplicant

          The money given for my children's

          camels, but your benevolence is

          like the shade of palm trees in an

          talks in hypnotic cadence, making eye contact with each

          boy in turn.

          THE CLERIC (CONT'D)

          The pain of living in the modern

          world will never be solved by a

          liberal society.

          The Cleric's sympathetic gaze falls on Wasim who is

          bruised with black eyes from his beating.

          THE CLERIC (CONT'D)

          Liberal societies have failed.

          Christian theology has failed. The

          West has failed.

          He serves more lamb and vegetables to Wasim's plate.

          Wasim begins hungrily eating again.

          87 EXT. MADRASSA COMMUNAL FARM - DAY 87

          Boys pull a plow in the fields. The sound of BEES.

          THE CLERIC (V.0.)

          The divine and the worldly are but

          a single concept and that concept

          is Koran.

          They walk past bee hives spaced across the desert. Farooq

          and Wasim and two OTHERS are with him.

          THE CLERIC (CONT'D)

          No separation of religion and

          state - Koran. Instead of Kings

          legislating and slaves obeying -

          Koran.

          They stand in a corn field growing in the desert. The

          boys are impressed with themselves as only young,

          uneducated men can be when discussing philosophy and

          politics with a learned man.

          THE CLERIC (CONT'D)

          The true confrontation is over

          Islam. They must eradicate Islam

          in order to rescue their own

          doctrine from extinction. True

          Islam will end up partial Islam.

          And partial Islam cannot exist.

          The cleric bends down to pull a weed.

          THE CLERIC (CONT'D)

          Do you believe me when I tell you

          this?

          Wasim watches Farooq nod emphatically. They are full and

          The Cleric seems to know everything in the world.

          The Cleric surveys the boys with quiet exaltation, his

          tenderness and compassion begins to affect Wasim.

          THE CLERIC (CONT'D)

          MEN, including Prince Nasir, sweep down the marble stairs

          to microphones. The PRESS snaps photos.

                         PRINCE NASIR

          a new generation of Arabs with the

          Bryan claps dutifully. But he's on the phone, the cord

          dangling from ear to Blackberry which reads "work."

          BRYAN (INTO PHONE)

          He invited me to come with him. I

          Bryan's phone vibrates again - JULIE HOME. He turns the

          phone off.

          PRINCE NASIR (CONT'D)

          However, unlike Washington's

          Greater Middle East Initiative, we

          respect each country's right to

          move at its own pace.

          APPLAUSE. One leader after another solemnly shake hands

          with Nasir as a photographer records the moment.

          ANGLE - A WEATHERED MAN

          In the crowd with a student's backpack at his feet.

          PRINCE NASIR moves down the steps. Bryan and the rest of

          his entourage join him heading toward black limousines.

          WEATHERED MAN picks up his pack, moves around the crowd,

          slips past a barrier.

           WEATHERED MAN (ARABIC)

           (to Prince Nasir)

           You are a good man. I want to

          shake your hand.

                          GUARDS (ARABIC)

          Stop. Don't move --

          WEATHERED MAN wears a serious expression heading straight

          for Nasir who turns and sees him --

          WEATHERED MAN (ARABIC)

          You are good man. Like Sadat, you

          will shake my hand. Good man.

          BODYGUARDS grab Nasir, hustling him toward a limo. Bryan

          lunging after them --

          The weathered man is tackled and pummeled.

          The limos race away, sirens blaring, flags flying.

          The weathered man is held and searched. They find pens

          and pads. His spilled bag held books.

          90 INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY 90

          Nasir and Bryan in a stretch with bodyguards as they race

          away with sirens blaring and flags flying.

          Bryan is pale. He watches Prince Nasir settle back into

          his seat. An AIDE fires Arabic at him.

                         AIDE (ARABIC)

          Your highness, do you still want

          to meet and greet?

          PRINCE NASIR (ARABIC)

          Everything as scheduled.

          Nasir looks out the window. He switches to English for

          Bryan but is speaking more to himself.

          PRINCE NASIR (CONT'D)

          Respect the right to move at their

          own pace. Respect the right to do

          nothing is more like it. Except

          condemn Israel and strengthen the

          conservative religious movements.

           Prince Nasir and his party enter the hotel and sweep

           through the lobby. They approach the elevators. Bryan and

           Prince Nasir and one bodyguard enter an elevator.

          The elevator TONES at another floor. The elevator stops,

          days.

          Bob doesn't say anything.

          PRINCE NASIR (CONT'D)

          It's too bad.

          Bob nods again. As the elevator moves higher more light

          floods in through the wire mesh. Bob's eyes meet Nasir's.

          Prince Nasir, Bryan, and bodyguards sit with a larger

          party across the rooftop garden.

          Bob sits by himself eating a sandwich. From below there

          is the distant THUMPING of a car stereo.

          A little bird dances along the railing watching for

          crumbs. All of Beirut is spread out below.

          PUSH past the bird over the railing where seven floors

          below a Toyota Land Cruiser pulls around the hotel.

          now completely empty, except for the Toyota Land Cruiser

          with dark tinted windows and five antennae. The stereo is

          thumping some odd AMERICAN SONG.

          Bob puts down bills for his check. The waiter is nowhere

          waiter's station.

          Bob glances over at Prince Nasir who is laughing at

          something in the Wall Street Journal.

          He's slammed against the door. Duct tape around his

          On a wooden table is a generator, a homemade shocking

          device the size of masonry brick with a long wire to the

          generator, and a thick pair of rubber gloves.

          Bob is duct-taped tightly to a chair. His face is

          battered. His mouth is cracked. He's severely dehydrated.

          His hands and feet are dark purple and swollen.

          A door opens. FOOTSTEPS. Mussawi's VOICE --

          MUSSAWI (O.S.)

          Bob, what do you know about

          torture methods used by the

          Chinese on the Falun Gong? Number

          one method? What's your guess?

          Water dungeon? Did-you guess water

          dungeon? Impractical here.

          Bob's POV of Mussawi crossing to the generator. He uses

          the hand crank, which makes a grinding SOUND.

          Number two method? Number two:

          twisting arm, putting face in

          feces. Not interested in two.

          call pulling nails from fingers.

          What do you think, Bob? Does

          Number three sound good to you?

          He lets go of the generator and picks up an evil-looking

          pair of pliers the size of bolt-cutters. Bob's POV over

          his own hands as Mussawi approaches.

                         MUSSAWI (CONT'D)

          The purpose is to get them to

          recant their beliefs.

          Mussawi circles behind Bob who tries to speak but his

          throat is too dry. Other MEN hold the chair steady.

                         MUSSAWI (CONT'D)

          What if I had to get you to'

          recant? That would be difficult,

          right? Because if you have no

          beliefs to recant, then what?

          Bob wiggles his hands as if they could escape. SOMEONE

          mashes Bob's right hand flat, splaying the fingers.

          You're fucked is what.

          Slowly Mussawi pulls with the pliers. Bob's eyes half-

          close. Mussawi jerks away. There's a fingernail in the

          pliers. Mussawi retches.

                         MUSSAWI (CONT'D)

          Ugh. That's disgusting.

          Bob is dazed. They throw water in his face.

          Come on, Bob. Help me out here.

          As water drips down Bob's face he holds his tongue out

          and drinks. His voice returns.

          From Bob's POV Mussawi loses his shit. He starts

          battering Bob, blood flying in ropes, the chair sliding

          across the floor. The men watch without expression.

          Bennett wanders over to the desk of another PARALEGAL. On

          one side there's a big stack of a papers he's moving to

          another stack. In the corner of the desk is a tiny stack.

                         BENNETT

          What are these?

          Orphans. Stuff that doesn't make

          any sense.

          Bennett idly fingers a piece of paper - a receipt.

          doesn't pertain to VIDAK LIMITED.

          Everyone groans. Someone tosses a file in the air.

          Bennett goes to his desk, looks up a number, dials the

          number. A voice answers in RUSSIAN.

          Does anyone here speak Russian?

          121 INT. HOTEL PRESIDENT WILSON - DAY 121

          Arabs stare out windows at the rain. Doors are open.

          People mingle. Smoke is in the air.

          A young WOMAN walks by, holding the hand of a much older

          MAN, laughing at something he's saying.

          122 INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT 122

          Bryan plays Monopoly with a group of young Arab MEN. They

          are using real money. The "bank" is stacks of hundreds

          and fifties and twenties. They smoke and drink. An Arab

          youth moves the silver top hat.

                         ARAB YOUTH

          Shit. Park Place. Shit --

          Park Place with hotels. Bryan holds Park Place. The Arab

          Youth takes off his diamond encrusted Rolex and tosses it

          toward the bank.

          El Segundo is like Saudi Arabia

          They hoot and protest. They don't believe him.

                         BRYAN (CONT'D)

          It's a desert town on an ocean

          controlled by an oil company.

          Tankers lined up offshore. There's

          this smell in the air. They pass

          out flyers to families moving in.

          This town is a quiet town where

          everyone works and our families

          are happy. If you have a problem

          with it or if you don't like the

          smell, you can leave.

                         ARAB YOUTH

          If anyone works, it can't be Saudi

          Arabia.

          They all LAUGH LOUDLY, then the laughter fades as they

          realize Julie and Riley are in the hotel room.

          Julie eyes the money and the Asian girl in the corner.

                         JULIE

          He wanted to say good night to his

          A middle-class suburban neighborhood so new the

          where a car with two MEN are following him. Bob pops a

          book on tape in and waits. It's Anna Karenina in Farsi.

          Fred Franks pulls into his driveway and gets out of the

          car. His WIFE appears at the front door and his kids

          gambol around -- exactly the tableau Bob has never had.

          Fred doesn't see Bob until Bob is right on him.

          This bureaucratic defense sends Bob over the edge --

                         BOB

          I was almost killed, Fred. My

          hands were mutilated. And they're

                         FRED FRANKS

          You gotta understand. This wrecks

          Reps of Halliburton, Bechtel, Danny Dalton, Dean Whiting.

          SECRETARY OF DEFENSE (CONT'D)

          A new regime would bring

          deliverance for Iran. Iranian

          resources are abundant, its

          culture is rich, its citizens are

          talented. And given a chance,

          there is no limit to what the

          Iranian people can achieve.

          What are they thinking? They're

          running out and ninety percent of

          what's left is in the Middle East.

          progression from Versailles,

          Gulf War II, it's really shaping

          146 INT. DOWNSTAIRS STUDY - NIGHT 146

          Whiting's study, unlike the standard, upper-crust,

          decorating of the rest of the home, has a specific Middle-

          Eastern flair. Persian antiques. Pictures of Whiting on a

          camel, with Persian friends at oxford in the sixties.

          Whiting is an Arabist.

          The motion sensor light is on. Whiting tries a window.

          How're we doing, Mr. Why-Teeng?

          It's secure. He tries another one. It's secure.

          Everything's fine.

          There's a sliding glass door that leads to a patio and

          pool. Whiting tries it and it slides open.

          The sliding door is unlocked.

          He turns slowly. The room looks different. There is an

          alcove with a wet-bar and walk-in closets.

          Did you leave it unlocked?

          Send a car, you imbecile.

          He looks at the alcove and closet. Just then, the desk

          phone RINGS, startling him. The phone rings and rings.

          on the wall behind Whiting's head are beautifully framed

          photos with Kissinger, Clinton, King Fahd. Rack focus off

           Hello.

          147 INT. DENNY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT 147

          It's early morning. A couple of drunks at the counter.

          Bob is at a booth with a mug of coffee. Dean Whiting

          appears outside the window, enters the restaurant, sits.

                         BOB

          You were in Beirut in '84.

                         WHITING

          I lost friends there as I'm sure

          you did.

                         (BEAT)

          I got a peek at your file. You're

          a good man, one whose experience

          is narrow and deep. Your entire

          career you've been used and

          probably never even known what

          for.

                         BOB

          I didn't used to need to know.

          A Grand Slam Breakfast is set in front of Bob.

                         WHITING

          In this town, you're innocent

          until you're investigated.

          Bob looks up and squints at the waitress' name-tag.

                         BOB

          Bacon looks perfect, Deborah.

          Bob puts syrup on the pancakes. Eats a piece of bacon.

                         BOB (CONT'D)

          Innocent until investigated.

          That's nice. It has a nice ring to

          it. I bet you've worn some miles

          on little sayings like that. Very

          wise, gives the listener the sense

          of law being written as it's

          spoken.

          If anything happens to me or my

          accusation, anything, then first

          your son will disappear, his body

          will never be found. Then your

          wife. Her body will never be found

          either. This is guaranteed. Then,

          whatever is the most dangerous

          thing you do in your life, it

          might be flying in a small plane,

          it might be walking to the bank,

          you will be killed.

          Do you understand what I'm saying?

          I want you to acknowledge that you

          do understand so that we're clear

          and there won't be any mistakes.

          After a beat, Whiting nods.

                         WHITING

          Beirut rules, Mr. Baer?

          Whiting loves the game. Bob looks tired, maybe a little

          sad.

                         BOB

          I've made decisions that resulted

          in deaths, but I never lost a

          nights sleep. Never. I killed

          people, but I always had about 500

          pages of U.S. law behind me, law

          that I believed in, and that was

          good enough.

                         WHITING

          You still do, Mr. Baer. You still

          do.

          Bob stares at him.

                         BOB

          I want my passports back.

          148 EXT. D.C. - DAY 148

          Tight on Bennett as he runs through a downtrodden

          neighborhood. Sweat dripping, breathing heavily, he runs

          faster and faster. People on stoops watch him go.

          He's oblivious to the UNMARKED CAR following him. Finally

          the car races up beside him. The window rolls down and

          Donald Parish III's face appears.

          Bennett keeps jogging.

                         FARISH (CONT'D)

          Bennett, I know you know about the

          crime fraud exception to attorney

          client privilege?

                         BENNETT

          I do, Don. Very well.

                         FARISH

          Then, you also know your client is

          into some shady stuff and it's

          starting to look like you could be

          involved in hiding the true nature

          of the transactions.

          Bennett stops. Farish's car stops. Bennett is panting.

                         BENNETT

          That's quite a statement, Don.

          149 INT. UNMARKED CRUISER - DAY 149

          Bennett rides with Farish. A long beat. Finally --

                         BENNETT

          One word. Dalton.

                         FARISH

          Danny Dalton?

                         BENNETT

          Defrauded the Government of

          Kazakhstan of funds to which it

          was entitled, defrauded the people

          of Kazakhstan of the right to the

          honest services of their elected

          and appointed officials. Seven

          years, does three, maybe two point

          seven, on your recommendation.

          out the window the bad neighborhood is giving way back to

          the developing neighborhood where Bennett lives.

                         FARISH

          And let me guess: this was a solo

          act, without the knowledge of

          Connex or Killeen Oil, of Mr. Lee

          Janus or Jimmy Pope.

                         BENNETT

          Dalton's a bit of a rogue, it's

          true.

                         FARISH

          And he'll have a nice little trust

          fund waiting when he gets out.

                         BENNETT

          Not so little, I imagine.

                         (BEAT)

          Don, we can spend the next five

          years in court to get back to this

          very place we are right now. They

          will fight tough. They will fight

          dirty. They will pressure your

          boss. They will pressure the

          people who appointed your boss.

          They will pressure the wives of

          the people who appointed your

          boss. You won't ever hit 'em any

          harder than this. And you know it.

          Bennett waits. After a beat Farish shakes his head.

                         FARISH

          I'm sorry, Bennett. I don't think

          Dalton's enough.

          Bennett uses the claw end of a hammer to pry the front

          off a large wooden crate. His father sits across the room

          reading the paper. The side of the box comes down.

          Bennett stares --

          ANGLE - THE STUFFED HEAD OF A KUDU.

          Bennett Sr. stares, then lights a cigarette.

                         BENNETT

          (re: the cigarette)

          I'm not doing: I'm not running a

          shelter. You going back to work?

          No answer.

                         BENNETT (CONT'D)

          What happened at your job anyway?

          Another jerk? Another white

          asshole? What? You think you get

          where I've gotten and there are

          less of them? You think I don't

          want a fucking drink? You have no

          idea what I'm doing, what is

          actually going on with me. The

          only way you can change this shit,

          all this shit, is from the inside.

          I'm trying to get inside. Which a

          fucking loser like you will never

          understand.

          Bennett Sr. puts down, his paper, stubs out his cigarette

          and starts for the door.

                         BENNETT (CONT'D)

          Good.

          The door shuts behind his dad --

          I love this country. It's a great

          country, if you're not a quitter.

          AND DON'T COME BACK!

          Slowly Bennett calms. He turns, looks at the Kudu. He

          thinks and the sound of a GRILL SIZZLING begins to RISE

          Ribs on a fancy BBQ grill. A wide expanse of lawn. No

                         BENNETT

          Dalton's not enough. So they will

          sit on him until he explains the

          how and why and the who, and they

          will be forced to unravel this

          light and warm and my house is

          light and warm, but what if it was

          that way half the week, or none of

          the week. Hell, China's economy

          ain't growing as fast as it could

          because they can't get all the oil

          they need. I'm damn proud of that

          above you. We'd have to have an

          understanding.

                         BENNETT

          If he's as big as you say then

          when he goes down the merger will

          be approved.

          Despite himself, Jimmy is impressed --

                         JIMMY POPE

          Just like that.

                         BENNETT

          We're looking for the illusion of

          due-diligence. Two criminal acts

          successfully prosecuted gives us

          that illusion.

          A group of twenty or thirty BOYS, including Wasim and

          Farooq, watch the video in a makeshift shed.

          this will remind me of God and his

          forgiveness. Two: I don't want

          anyone to rip their clothes or

          slap their faces because this is

          an ignorant thing to do.

          Mohammed Sheik Agiza watches the boys watch the video.

          MOHAMMED SHEIK AGIZA

          His influence on those left behind

          grows. There is no sense of loss,

          since he continues to live and

          inspire, his fame spreading.

          Wasim impassively stares at the video.

          Golden honey flares in sunlight dripping off a comb into

          a collection jug. Wasim replaces the comb into a hive.

          In a line of square wooden hives, Farooq removes a comb

          and begins draining the honey.

          Wasim pulls out another comb.

                         PRINCE NASIR

          For centuries Islam has been ruled

          by people with no respect for law,

          monopolies handed out for the

          things that people want, commerce

          stifled, young people unable to

          find jobs, critics jailed or put

          to death, women are second-class

                         CITIZENS --

           Tomorrow is the coronation. Your

           brother has the support of the

           United States. And 10,000 of their

           troops are stationed in our

          country.

                         PRINCE NASIR

          This is true. My father is ill and

          weak and unwilling to fight the

          Americans. But others are willing.

          And when a country has five

          percent of the world's population

          but does fifty percent of its

          military spending, then the

          persuasive powers of that country

          are on the decline.

          The crowd is unmoved. Rallying the men will not be easy.

          The crowd of Chiefs and Technicians erupts into

          celebration, handshakes and high-fives.

          ANGLE - MONITOR

          The tendril of black smoke is spreading into a black

          cloud. The vehicles are stopped.

          The room is silent. Mr. Janus stares into the crowd.

          MR. JANUS

          I accept this award on behalf of

          the employees of Connex-Killeen,

          our people, the finest in the

          world...

                         (MOVED)

          Guys, could I get you to stand up

          for a moment?

          At the CONNEX table, Tommy and Jimmy and the others get

          to their feet. The crowd APPLAUDS. Bennett applauds Jimmy

          who sees him clapping and applauds him right back --

          The Prince Nasir convoy is scattered like toys. People

          broken with shock and awe.

          Debris is still falling. Find Bryan moving forward

          through smoke and overturned vehicles, the only sound the

          BUZZING/RINGING in his ears.

          Bryan's POV of a burning crater in the road. Nasir's car

          and family are completely incinerated. And nearby Bob's

          car is a massive ball of flame.

          Mr. Janus'holds out his hands to still APPLAUSE.

          MR. JANUS

          I want to thank our strategic

          friends from around the globe who

          are here tonight.

          More APPLAUSE. Emir Meshal Al-Subaai gives a little wave

          to both sides of the room.

          MR. JANUS (CONT'D)

          I hope I'm not giving away trade

          secrets when I say Liquefied

          Natural Gas truly is the fuel of

          the future.

          Mr. Janus raises his crystal derrick in a toast.

          MR. JANUS (CONT'D)

          And to everyone else who helps

          make this the most exciting and

          important and profitable industry

          on earth.

          The crowd again begins CLAPPING for itself. Light catches

          the crystal oil derrick and refracts --

          Bryan staggers away. We're ON HIS BACK as he slogs, then

          WE COME AROUND...

          Bryan's face is TIGHT in half the frame while behind him

          the wreckage and people and smoke trail away.

          Bryan wipes at a tear, and another. Then suddenly, he's

          weeping, losing it completely. He stumbles blindly on.

          Bryan wanders through the desert, a hazy form merging

          with the heat shimmering horizon.

          206 EXT. FISHING BOAT - DAY 206

          Tight on Farooq's eyes. Farooq is terrified. He stares at

          Wasim who is watching the tanker where workers and

          touring dignitaries pay no attention.

          On another boat a father and son fishermen going about

          their business. The father smiles briefly at Wasim.

          Wasim sees that Farooq is frozen. Wasim shouts at him in

          Urdu. Farooq hesitates a moment longer, then his hand

          pushes the throttle forward.

          The dhow accelerates, breaking free of the flotilla,

          heading straight for the CONDOLEEZA RICE (LNG CARRIER).

          At the bowsprit, Wasim has the wind and sunlight and

          spray in his face.

          WASIM'S POV of the CONTAINMENT BUBBLES which have a

          covering of frozen, sparkling condensate and look exactly

          like SNOW COVERED MOUNTAINS.

          On Wasim's face a slow, almost beatific smile begins to

          spread. He seems completely at peace as he passes into

          the shadow of the tanker.

          On the CONDOLEEZA RICE sailors become alarmed, running in

          different directions, but it's too late

          The little boat speeds for the side of the tanker and

          just as it makes impact --

          Wasim appears against a plain background. He looks very

          During the funeral I want everyone

          Riley plays with a Thomas Train set. Julie reads in a

          You should throw dust on my body

          three times while saying, from the

          dust we created you and to dust

          you will return.

          Riley sees his mother looking past him. He turns, sees

          his father, and runs toward him. Bryan gathers his son up

          in his arms.

          WASIM (V.0.) (CONT'D)

          From the dust a new person will be

          created.

          Bryan looks through the rooms at his wife who has taken a

          few steps toward him. She hesitates --
