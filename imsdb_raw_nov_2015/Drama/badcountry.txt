            A rusted Chevy El Camino drives against dissolving Louisiana

            landscapes - broad, barren, pounded by the rain.

            I/E. EL CAMINO, TRAVELING - DUSK

            Occasional oncoming headlights illuminate the driver's face:

            Tense, course features, thick beard... He's BUD CARTER, 31.

            AN INTERSTATE SIGN PASSES ON THE RIGHT: "WHISKEY BAY"

            Bud pulls onto a dirt road, into a TRAILER PARK and stops.

            INT. DOUBLE-WIDE TRAILER - DUSK

            TITLE IN: Denham Springs, Louisiana. 1983.

            We're staring at three sacks of sample unmounted EMERALDS,

            set on a filthy counter.

                                SOUTHERN MAN'S VOICE O.S.

                      Now these here are Brazilian, from Bahia.

                      Deep cuts. Damn good. These is India,

                      paler, but also good. And this is

                      Columbia. From them limestone caves up in

                      Muzo.

            WIDEN to reveal NADY GRACE, 35. A tattooed man with thinning

            hair, leading Bud through the sale...

                                GRACE

                      Now them first two, you gonna get your

                      money's worth.

                          (re: COLUMBIA EMERALDS)

                      This one here's more expensive, but

                      that's 'cause there ain't a nigger flaw

                      in one of 'em. They hard as steel and

                      emerald green as emerald green fuckin'

                      comes. Lookit that.

                                BUD

                      That's nice.

                                GRACE

                      That's the real McCoy. That's what that

                      is.

                                BUD

                      Tell you what... Bag 'em all. The

                      market's got a hard-on for this shit.

                                GRACE

                      I hear that.

                          (across the room)

                      Jake, get on it.

            ACROSS THE ROOM are two other men -- JAKE and DOUG. Ex-cons

            at a table, riffing through Bud's cash.

            A CURTAIN YANKS BACK and RAY WHEELER, 29, enters. Dope-thin,

            bloodshot eyes. He looks at Bud. Bud looks at him... Ray

            clicks on the TV and opens a beer. 

            TV IN: Evening news. The storm outside alters the reception.

                                NEWSCASTER

                      ...And today, thirty-one year old Gary

                      murder in the slaying of accused sex

                      offender, Jeffrey Doucett.

            Bud watches Ray empty a gram of coke onto the bar. Using a

            credit card, Ray starts chopping lines. The SOUND continues

            throughout the scene... 

                                NEWSCASTER (TV)

                      ...District Court Judge Frank Salia,

                      after Doucett was first arrested.

            Grace hefts a lock box to the counter, removes a drawer of

            emeralds. Bud SEES packed carelessly underneath, uncut

            DIAMONDS.

                                BUD

                      What do you got there? Diamonds?

                                GRACE

                      That's thirty grand. Out the door. You

                      interested?

                                BUD

                      Ain't got the scratch right now. But I am

                      interested.

            And the volume of the TV now becomes more apparent...

                                NEWSCASTER O.S.

                      ...As a result of numerous threats made

                      weeks ago, tight security surrounded the

                      courthouse. However, missing from today's

                      hearing, was the arresting officer.

            Bud has been tuning out the TV distraction... until that last

            statement. He sneaks a look.

                      From East Baton Rouge Sheriff's office...

            A wave of static scrambles the picture. When it clears...

                      ...Police Lieutenant, Bud Carter.

            Bud is stunned. HIS OWN FACE APPEARS ON THE SCREEN. A younger

            photo of Bud, clean shaven - DRESSED IN POLICE UNIFORM.

            EXT. TRAILER PARK - SAME 

            Rain pours. A beat-up PLUMBER'S VAN is parked in the distance.

            INT. GRACE'S TRAILER - SAME 

            TV IN: Signal wavers. It's archive footage of Baton Rouge

            Airport. A prisoner, JEFFREY DOUCETT, escorted by police.

                                NEWSCASTER

                      Doucett was being extradited to Baton

                      Rouge.

            Ray does a line of coke, keeps chopping. Watches the TV.

            Grace is bagging emeralds.

            Jake and Doug count cash.

            Bud keeps the TV in sight. Quick glances. Mind racing.

            TV IN: The procession moves past a row of pay phones. At one

            phone, a discreet figure, GARY PLAUCHE, turns...

                                NEWSCASTER

                      The victim's father, Gary Plauche, stood

                      waiting at the terminal. As Doucett

                      walked by, Plauche turned, raised a

                      handgun...and fired.

            Bud's vision is suddenly obscured when Grace steps forward

            with the emeralds in a satchel.

                                GRACE

                      Here you go. Fifteen three-karat blues.

                      Wholesale. Twenty large.

            Sudden GUNSHOTS and SCREAMS on the TV. Everyone turns...

            TV IN: Jeffrey Doucett lies dead as POLICE wrestle Gary

            Plauche to the ground amid chaos.

                                NEWSCASTER

                      Lieutenant Carter was unavailable for

            TIGHT ON RAY'S EYES, intense, watching the footage. 

            As Bud stuffs the satchel in his coat, WE SEE what Ray

            sees...

            TV IN: Bud, POLICE BADGE AROUND HIS NECK, arresting Plauche.

            ON RAY, slow burn realization as he looks from the tv to Bud.

            And again. EYES LOCK, THEY BOTH KNOW.

                                RAY

                      Motherfucker, he's a cop.

            Bud yanks a .45.

            And everything happens at once.

            A SUDDEN GUNSHOT and Jake FIRES again.

            Wood splinters as Bud FIRES back.

            Jake is HIT in the throat. A SECOND SHOT in the forehead - he

            SLAMS against the window, cracking it...

            INT. PLUMBER'S VAN - SAME 

            Among surveillance equipment, sits Bud's crew: TODD SHEPARD,

            DAVID MARANDINO and DALE COBB.

            Gunshots ECHO.

                                SHEPARD

                      Fuck! Go! Go!

            Marandino, behind the wheel, SLAMS his foot on the gas.

            INT. GRACE'S TRAILER - SAME 

            A SHOT ZIPS across Bud's back; he SPINS off the table.

            On his knees, Doug is firing a .32. BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM.

            Bud FIRES a burst through Doug's chest, dropping him.

            A HOLE EXPLODES beside Bud's head -- Grace FIRING a .45 -- as

            Ray SCREAMS and runs out the door.

            EXT. TRAILER PARK, VAN - SAME 

            Marandino winds through gears, as Ray hits the yard

            running... 

            POV THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: Marandino swings the wheel hard,

            SLAMS INTO RAY -- launching him through trash bins, into the

            mud.

            Cobb jumps from the van and pounds Ray into handcuffs.

            Simultaneously, Shepard sprints for the trailer door...

            EXT. GRACE'S TRAILER PARK - SAME 

            Grace explodes from the back door, bolting across the yard.

            I/E. GRACE'S TRAILER - SAME 

            Bud scrambles on the floor of the demolished trailer. .45

            held tight, he runs out after Grace.

            ACROSS THE YARD

            the chase rages. 

            MOVING WITH GRACE

            as he jumps a link fence, lands and trips into a roll of

            chicken wire. His sleeve catches, rips as he pulls free...

            MOVING WITH BUD

            at a searing pace. He slips in the mud. Staggers up. SEES

            Grace disappear in the shadows.

            Grace throws himself against the side of a power unit. Eyes

            darting. Wheezing hard... Tries to slow his breath. Then

            turns the corner...

            GRACE'S POV: A SHOVEL swings from around the corner, WHAM!!!

            The blow sends Grace sailing back. He SLAMS on the ground,

            with a blood-covered broken face. As he tries to get up...

            Bud's gun is there. And like that, it stops.

            INT. SOUTHDOWN'S BAR - AFTER HOURS

            At a table, the METRO SQUAD: Bud, Shepard, Marandino, Cobb

            are drinking. A bartender (SHERRY) is wiping down glasses...

                                COBB

                      Think I broke a knuckle on that guy's

                      tooth.

                                SHEPARD

                      He only had one tooth.

                                COBB

                      Well I got it, didn't I?

                                MARANDINO

                          (to the bartender)

                      Another round, Sherry.

                                SHERRY

                      Comin' up.

            Bud blows smoke, distant from the others.

                                MARANDINO

                      Bud, we all supposed to be celebratin'.

                      'Been workin' this case for months. And

                      you ain't said shit.

                                BUD

                      They had a lot of weight. Too much.

                                COBB

                      It's a ring. Organized burglary. 

                                BUD

                      You saw them guys. You think that half

                      ass crew was organized?

                                MARANDINO

                          (laughs)

                      They shit their pants in unison.

                                COBB

                      What are you gettin' after, Bud?

                                SHEPARD

                      You think it was someone else's score. 

            Sherry arrives with shots of whiskey, moves on.

                                BUD

                      I think its a part of somethin' bigger.

            Bud takes his shot.

                                BUD

                      Tomorrow morning we put our friends under

                      the lamp. If they know this "someone

            A dark, stone monolith off the 110 highway.

            INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH JAIL - DAY

            Bud smokes, standing with Shepard in semi-darkness. They're

            looking through a two-way mirror into an INTERROGATION ROOM,

            where Cobb interviews Ray Wheeler.

                                RAY

                      I told you... I keep tellin' you... I

                      don't know nothin'. That's it.

                                COBB

                      That's not it. We've been here all

                      morning. We'll stay here all night.

            Bud paces to a neighboring INTERROGATION ROOM where Marandino

            is questioning Grace (bruised face, swollen, broken nose).

                                MARANDINO

                      The stones you were fencin' belonged to

                      an Amsec wall safe in "Kay's Jewelers".

                      The rest from a vault in Bocage. Both

                      owners can verify their belongings, and

                      have. 

                          (beat)

                      Who you fencin' for?

                                GRACE

                      Man, I ain't sayin' fuckin' shit.

                                MARANDINO

                      Then your name's on a dozen other jobs,

                      just like it.

                                GRACE

                      That's bullshit.

                                MARANDINO

                      No, that's a promise.

            Bud, sipping coffee, paces back to Ray's interview...

                                COBB

                      We got a series of burglaries in the

                      area. All over the last six months. All

                      still open. You don't talk, it's on you.

                                RAY

                      Well I ain't got nothin' to do with that.

                                COBB

                      Any idea who does?

                                RAY

                      No! Okay? Fuck no.

            Bud sets down his coffee, calm.

            INT. GRACE'S INTERROGATION ROOM

            Marandino sits across from Grace, clearly frustrated.

                                MARANDINO

                      ...Answer the question.

                                GRACE

                          (exploding)

                      MAN FUCK THIS! AND FUCK YOU! Y'ALL CREW'S

                      JUST FAGGOTS IN MATCHING JACKETS!

            The door blasts open. Bud charges in, throws Grace against

            the wall, then slams his face onto the table, pushing down.

                                BUD

                      Try this. I know you're too fuckin' dumb

                      to be any more than a courier. I know

                      you're coverin' for someone else. NOW

                      TELL ME WHO THAT SOMEONE IS!

                                GRACE

                      I ain't a rat!

                                BUD

                      YOU AIN'T A RAT?!

            Bud twists his broken nose. Grace SCREAMS.

                                MARANDINO

                      Easy, Bud. Go easy.

                                GRACE

                          (to Marandino)

                      STOP THIS SHIT! STOP HIM!

            Marandino puts a hand on Bud's shoulder; Bud shoves him off.

                                BUD

                      LOCK THE DOOR!

            Marandino locks it. Bud turns Grace's nose even harder,

            nearly rips it off his face.

                                BUD

                      I'll teach you what commitment is... I'll

                      throw you in an eight by nine and have

                      you fucked in the ass by every inmate in

                      the state of Louisiana-- AND THAT'S THE

                      REST OF YOUR LIFE!

            Grace, spitting blood now. Choking. Bud twists. Bone cracks.

                                BUD

                      GIVE ME A NAME!

                                GRACE

                          (hacking)

                      He's from Whiskey Bay--!

                                BUD

                      --GIVE ME A NAME!!

            EXT. CLAYTON STREET - NIGHT

            Raining.

            An unmarked chevy is staked down the block from a tract home.

                                BUD V.O.

                      Jesse Wheeler. Thirty-one.

            INT. CHEVY - NIGHT

            Bud's in the front seat, looking through a file. Shepard at

            the wheel. Coffee cups and junk food litter the dash.

                                BUD

                      Two tours in 'Nam. '69 and '71. He's a

                      jump marine. Weapons trained, explosives.

                          (turns the page)

                      Seven and a half out of a twelve year

                      stint for federal robbery. Two in Angola.

                      A year in DeQuincy. Three in El Reno with

                      a transfer to Lewisburg. Then Marion with

                      a brief stopover in Leavenworth. Released

                      from Oxford, 1981.

                                SHEPARD

                      Jacket's the size of the bible.

            Through the windshield, across the street, a tract home

            they're watching.

                                BUD

                      His stay at Marion, they kept him in "H"

                      block.

                                SHEPARD

                      H block? That's home to forty top murder

                      one inmates...

                                BUD

                      Yeah, life sentences. Jesse only had

                      twelve years.

            Bud likes it.

                                BUD

                      He ain't just woodwork.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

            Night passes and the dawn arrives...

            EXT. WHEELER'S HOUSE - DAWN

            Front door opens and the shadowy figure of JESSE WHEELER,

            whose face we cannot see, emerges.

                                SHEPARD

                          (waking Bud)

                      Target's out.

            Jesse fires up his '74 battered green PICK-UP TRUCK. He backs

            from the driveway and proceeds down the street.

                                BUD

                          (into radio)

                      Alright. Give him room.

            Bud's car starts and we move off with them...

                                BUD

                          (into radio)

                      We're mobile.

            EXT. STREETS - MINUTES LATER

            In the rain, Bud and Shepard tail Jesse from a distance.

            They pass an alley where a waiting BUICK falls in behind the

            Chevy; Marandino and Cobb are inside.

            INT. CHEVY - CONTINUOUS - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD:

            We see the truck slowing, angling into a TEXACO STATION.

                                SHEPARD

                      He's turnin' off.

                                BUD

                      Let's take him in the car.

                          (into radio)

                      Wait'll he's stopped. Watch your

                      backgrounds.

            INT. JESSE'S PICK UP - MOMENTS LATER

            Jesse stops at a pump. Suddenly, Bud appears at the window

            and jams a SHOTGUN against Jesse's head.

                                BUD

                      Don't move. You motherfuck, I'll blow

                      your head clean off.

            Reflecting in the side-view: Bud's BADGE swings from his

            neck. Jesse's eyes resign to relief. Bud SEES this...

                                BUD

                      Shut the car off slowly.

            With several law enforcement shotguns now leveled at him from

            all directions, Jesse turns off his engine.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. JESSE WHEELER'S HOUSE - MORNING

            Bud, Shepard, Cobb and Marandino, vests and shotguns, move in

            unison around the house.

            Bud and Cobb stay to the shadows, down a side yard...

            Shepard, Marandino reach the front door. Locked. A tv plays

            quietly inside. No one in the windows. 

            Shepard signals to Marandino...

            INT. JESSE WHEELER'S HOUSE

            THE FRONT DOOR IS KICKED DOWN. Shepard and Marandino spill

            in, guns ready...

                                SHEPARD

                      POLICE! WARRANT!

            A pregnant woman in the kitchen... LYNN WHEELER, 30s. She

            SCREAMS, curses. Hurling dirty dishes fly like frisbees. 

                                LYNN

                      GET OUT! GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE!

                                MARANDINO

                      MA'AM, CALM DOWN! CALM DOWN!

                                SHEPARD

                      WE GOT A WARRANT!

                                LYNN

                          (more dishes)

                      FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU!

            Lynn suddenly gasps agitatedly, sinks to the floor. A GUSH OF

            FLUID soaks through her dress. 

                                LYNN

                      Help... My baby...my baby...

            Bud and Cobb enter from a back door, hurry towards Lynn. Bud

            lowers Lynn to the floor.

                                BUD

                          (to Cobb)

                      CALL AN AMBULANCE! NOW!

            BEDROOM - TIME CUT

            A door slams open to reveal...

            A NAZI IRON EAGLE BATTLE FLAG. Draped across the far wall.

            Windows taped over. Walls painted black.

            Military surplus on every shelf and surface. Helmets.

            Uniforms. Body armor. Bayonets.

            Bud in the doorway. Shepard joins him.

                                BUD

                      Toss everything.

                                                           SMASH CUT TO:

            Several COPS(now on scene) ransack the house. Ripping open

            cabinets, drawers, tossing everything to the floor...

            GARAGE

            Cobb flips a switch. A lamp illuminates a workbench.

                                COBB

                      Alright, I want everything seized!

            Cabinets, lockers and tool boxes slam open. Cops stop cold,

            blown away by what they see: GUNS. Everywhere.

            LIVING ROOM

            COP #1 feels behind a couch. He finds a .38, then a COLT .25

            below a chair cushion.

            BATHROOM

            COP #2 removes the toilet's basin cover. With a pen, he

            removes a dripping .357.

            KITCHEN

            Several STATE TROOPERS lead Jesse in, cuff him to a table.

            ATTIC

            Floor peels back. Flashlights illuminate: AMMUNITION BOXES.

            ASSAULT RIFLES. GRENADES. BONDS and COUNTERFEIT PLATES.

                                MARANDINO

                      Motherfucker's got a general store.

            LIVING ROOM

            Cops talk excitedly over one another. Shepard leans over a

            mounted A.C. He finds a string and very slowly pulls up a

            ziploc bag filled with DIAMONDS.

                                SHEPARD

                      God damn...there's some weight.

            KITCHEN

            Bud takes a seat at the table...

            For the first time, we get a good look at Jesse Wheeler: Cold

            eyes. Handlebar mustache. Covered in tats. With a

            boilermaker's build, he looks what he is... DANGEROUS.

                                BUD

                      I'm Detective Lieutenant Bud Carter, of

                      the East Baton Rouge Parish Precinct.

                          (smiles)

                      So how you like Baton Rouge?

            Jesse's stare drifts to Bud. It's deadly.

            Cabinets slam open and closed. Dishes hit the floor.

                                JESSE

                      What happened to my wife?

                                BUD

                      Water broke. She's en route to the

                      hospital.

            COP #3 is searching the refrigerator. Jesse watches as if

            he's seen something we haven't... Cop #3 moves on...

            Jesse sees Bud's eyes. They connect with his own...

            Bud opens the fridge. He scans condiments then stops. From

            inside a bag of HOT DOG BUNS, several sealed VIALS.

                                BUD

                      This is new.

            Bud examines a vial's label: "CYANIDE."

                                BUD

                      What's the cyanide for, Jesse?

                                JESSE

                      Extracting impurities.

            Bud, right with him, grins.

                                BUD

                      Impurities from what?

            Jesse, calm. Deadpan.

                                BUD

                      You're in a bad situation here, pal.

                                JESSE

                      I'll make bond.

            Bud looks in Jesse's eyes and believes it.

            BEDROOM

            Shepard, searching the room. Drawers, cabinets. Then leans

            down to peer under the bed... 

            ...stops, stunned when he SEES: a row of live Goex charges in

            packing, boldly marked: EXPLOSIVES

                                SHEPARD

                          (top of his lungs)

                      OUT! EVERYONE OUT! GET THE FUCK OUT!

            INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRECINCT - DAY

            MIKE BRADDOCK (40s), Captain of Detectives, enters his

            office. Bud tows, carrying files.

                                BRADDOCK

                      What more do you want? You got a two time

                      felon on multiple counts. You got

                      robbery, B&E, you got an all-you-can-eat

                      felony fuckin' possession. All on top of

                      an organized burglary ring.

                                                               INTERCUT:

            ON A CAMERA FLASH. Mug shots of Jesse's front and profile.

                                BRADDOCK V.O.

                      The man's in custody, Bud. Fucked for

                      life. It's finished.

            Jesse's inked fingers are rolled onto an exemplar sheet.

            INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRECINCT - DAY

                                BUD

                      There's more, I know it.

            Bud slaps a file on Braddock's desk, to a crime scene photo:

            An Asian JUDGE sits dead in the front seat of his car.

                                BUD

                      Remember him? Ten months ago, a judge

                      gets popped with a .357. Well I got a

                      Ruger from Wheeler's toilet and rushed it

                      through ballistics.

                                BRADDOCK

                      And?

                                BUD

                      It's a solid match! Dead on. 

                                BRADDOCK

                      There's a dozen ways Wheeler could've got

                      that burner. It don't prove a thing. 

                                BUD

                          (drops another file)

                      A stack of bonds taken from the home of a

                                BUD

                      Murdered. He and his wife. Looked like a

                      robbery gone to shit then; I want it

                      opened back up.

            A nude Jesse steps before a DOCTOR and gets a cursory exam.

                      I still got tests pending. More guns.

                      More cases. This guy ain't crazy, Mike.

                      So who's backin' him?

                                BUD

                      I don't know; I do know they'll post his

                      bond. That's why I need a price they

                      can't come up with overnight.

            Braddock listens. Bud keeps it on track...

                                BUD

                      I'm right about this, Mike.

                          (leans close)

                      When a guy's lookin' at two hundred years

                      and he ain't upset... It's like when your

                      wife is accusing you of fuckin' the

                      neighbor, but she don't know you're

                      fuckin' her sister too. You're pretty

                      calm about it, right?

            Braddock smiles slightly.

                                BUD

                      It's 'cause we hit the wrong nerve. The

                      guns, the other shit, the time... He can

                      have that conversation. And he is. And he

                      ain't upset. He's makin' eye contact,

                      'cause we're fallin' short.

                          (the bottom line)

                      This guy knows things. He knows where

                      bodies are.

            Braddock, thinks; Then--

                                BRADDOCK

                      I'll bounce it up to the D.A.

            Bud grins, SLAMS his hand on the desk.

            INT. HOLDING AREA, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DUSK

            Two GUARDS escort Jesse. He's bound in chains, orange scrubs. 

            INT. HOLDING CELL

            End of the hall. A BLACK PRISONER waits, arms slung over the

            crossbars with a cigarette. Jesse is brought forth.

            A Guard unlocks the cell. The Black Prisoner steps back,

            joining TWO OTHERS: All black, looming in the darkness.

            Jesse steps in. Guards unlock his shackles. Chains hit the

            floor. Behind him, the bars slam home.

            SILENCE...LONG, DRAWN SILENCE. THEN:

                                JESSE

                      My name is Jesse Wheeler... I'm now in

                      charge of this cell. Any y'all don't like

                      it, step your black ass forward, line up.

            A MOMENT. Cued by Jesse's challenge, each of the prisoners

            slowly rise, vehemently approaching...

                                                          CUT ABRUPT TO:

            And the phone RINGS...

                      Bud? Charlie Bowers.

            WIDEN. Bud's house is sparsely furnished. Books on firearms

            and police work in stacks. As he reaches for a file...

                                BUD

                          (into phone)

                      named Jesse Wheeler.

            CHARLIE BOWERS, on an official phone. At Jesse's name, he's

            DEAD QUIET...

                                BUD

                      Charlie, you there?

                                CHARLIE

                      What's your interest in this guy, Bud?

                                BUD

                      Well, we got him on weapons and burglary.

                      But I got a feelin' there's more.

                                CHARLIE

                      Damn straight, a lot more. Race riots.

                      Smuggling. Extorting a guard. I had a few

                      run-ins with him myself.

                                BUD

                      What else?

            INT. BEDROOM, BUD'S HOUSE - PRE DAWN

            Bud lies in bed, wide awake. The PHONE CONVERSATION carries

            over...

                                CHARLIE V.O.

                      You could say this is where he peaked.

            KITCHEN - DAWN

            Coffee pours into a mug. Then a shot of Irish Whiskey.

                                CHARLIE V.O.

                      He's a white supremacist. The worst kind,

                      if there is one.

            Bud, dressed now. The table is covered with various reports

            and photos from Jesse's file. BUD'S EYES guide us through...

                                CHARLIE V.O.

                      Came in on armed robbery and assault...

            Bud picks up a photo: Jesse's Angola mug shot, age 23.

                                CHARLIE V.O.

                      But word in the system said, he's a

                      contract killer for the Aryan

                      Brotherhood.

            Photos of Jesse's tattoos: SUN-WHEEL on the shoulder; HELL

            HOUNDS around the biceps, THOR'S ELAPID covering his back.

                                CHARLIE V.O.

                      In here, the guy became an organizer...

            INT. BUD'S CAR, TRAVELING - MORNING

            Bud's face goes in and out of light and shadow.

                                CHARLIE V.O.

                      Controlling hits and movements inside the

                      system. Prison to prison. State to state.

            INT. LOWER FLOOR, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - MORNING

            Bud is walking with MURPHY, captain of the guards...

                                CHARLIE V.O.

                      Between the Aryan Brotherhood and Neo

                      Nazis, he unified the front...

            Bud and Murphy descend steps to a grim CORRIDOR.

                                CHARLIE V.O.

                      All them prison gangs in the world...

                      Black Panthers, Mexican Mafia, forget it.

                      The AB is deadly as it gets. And Jesse

                      Wheeler was their ring leader.

            The PHONE CONVERSATION fades out... Presently:

                                BUD

                      So what the fuck happened?

                                MURPHY

                      Processing ain't open till morning. We

                      threw him in holding last night. 'Fore we

                      even turn around, it's like we're back in

                      the fuckin' Alamo.

                                BUD

                      He attack the guards?

                                MURPHY

                      Guards are fine. But he took on three

                      niggers like they stole from him.

            Murphy stops outside a solid steel door.

                                MURPHY

                      I'll tell you somethin', Bud. After it

                      happened, our block was the quietest it'd

                      ever been. Wish we had ten just like him.

                                BUD

                      Open the door.

            INT. ISOLATION CELL - CONTINUOUS

            Bud enters. Murphy shuts the door and a series of locks BOLT.

            We're in a stone closet. No bed or sink. No light.

                                BUD

                      Heard you refused a public defender.

            Jesse's bruised face moves through shadow.

                                BUD

                      At the gas station...When you were

                      arrested, I put a gun to your head.   

                      You expected someone else.

                                JESSE

                      You don't look like cops.

                                BUD

                      And your house? Guns. Mass supply tells

                      me, intent to sell. Cyanide in the

                      fridge, explosives...tells me you're

                      scared.

            Jesse's eyes emerge from the dark. Bud, looking right at him.

                                BUD

                      I know who you are.

                                JESSE

                      If you knew that much, you wouldn't be in

                      here alone.

            Bud smiles and walks to the door.

                                BUD

                      One more thing, pal. I saw the judge this

                      morning.

                          (grins)

                      There is no bond.

            HOLD on Jesse.

            Bud BANGS on the door. Locks UNLATCH. The door opens and Bud

            steps calmly out to the hall...

            The door shuts with a BOOM, locking Jesse in. And the nail in

            the coffin resonates.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

            EXT. GREYHOUND STATION - LATE NIGHT

            Dim and desolate.

            INT. LOBBY, GREYHOUND STATION - LATE NIGHT

            Grace buys a ticket, crosses the lobby to the men's room.

            INT. MEN'S ROOM

            Grace at the sink. He pats running water on his damaged face

            and straightens the bandage. 

            A TOILET FLUSHES

            the stall door opens and a man emerges. Lean and fierce, like

            an electric charge... CATFISH STANTON, 30.

            Grace FREEZES at the sight of Catfish, tightening his belt.

            Lets the water run...

                                CATFISH

                      Grace? That you?

                                GRACE

                      Hey there, Catfish...

            Catfish steps close, reaches a hand to Grace's face.

                                CATFISH

                      'The hell happened?

            Grace flinches. Catfish pauses, then SNIFFS his hand.

                                CATFISH

                          (smiles)

                      Oh... Excuse me.

            Catfish steps to the sink. Begins washing his hands.

                                CATFISH

                      So where you off to?

                                GRACE

                      Goin' to visit my mother. She's real

                      sick.

                                CATFISH

                      That's too bad. So you'll be gone a long

                      time then.

                                GRACE

                      Yeah...

            Another MAN suddenly enters. Large and imposing, neck tattoos

            ...BUZZ MCKINNON, 32.

                                GRACE

                          (swallows hard)

                      Buzz.

            Catfish turns off the water. THE BATHROOM IS SUFFOCATED WITH

            SILENCE.

                                GRACE

                      What can I do y'all for?

                                CATFISH

                      How come the Wheeler brothers, is locked

                      up? And you ain't?

                                GRACE

                      Wheeler brothers is locked up? I don't

                      know nothin' about that. 

            Catfish GRINS. It's harsh. Blood curdling.

                                CATFISH

                      I heard different.

                                GRACE

                      Well there ain't no "different" to hear,

                      Catfish. 'Cause I ain't talked to neither

                      of 'em.

                                CATFISH

                      But you did talk to someone.

            Buzz moves. Grace turns to look...

            ...In a blink, Catfish's gun comes up: ONE QUICK POP. A .45

            with a thick, barrel silencer. The mirror shatters. Grace's

            knees hit the floor. His head hits the sink, HOLDS. As blood

            runs from one small hole.

            Catfish straightens up in the next mirror. Tucks his shirt.

            Grace's body sags to the floor. Catfish and Buzz walk out.

            INT. EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY

            LOUD BUZZER. Two GUARDS #1 and #2 march Jesse down the tier.

            On his left, PRISONERS in cells, TURN, STARE and WHISPER. 

            Jesse arrives at a cell.

                                GUARD #1

                          (calls out)

                      Open ninety-six!

            BARS slide back. Jesse walks in. His CELL-MATE steps

            cautiously from the shadows... 

            IT'S RAY. Pale and nervous. Jesse stands over him. The

            brothers' eyes connect. And there's a moment...

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. EXERCISE YARD, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY

            High stone walls topped with concertina wire. Looming guard

            towers. Thick FOG blankets the yard filled with CONVICTS.

            Jesse takes hold of a metal bar, lifts it from a bench press.

            He does two reps. The weights BANG down and Jesse sits up.

                                RAY O.S.

                      This place is bad...

            Ray adds weight to the already excessive amount. He sweats as

            he talks nervously over Jesse's shoulder... 

                                RAY

                      There's eyes everywhere. Like I got a

                      sign on my back, Jesse, they all think I

                      talked.

            Jesse scans numerous WHITE CONS watching the Wheeler brothers.

                                RAY

                      Just the other day... some spic fish got

                      hit with a weight. Ten other cons, they

                      beat him and stabbed him till there

                      weren't nothin' left. And the guards let

                      it happen.

            Ray fastens the safety collars and Jesse leans back.

                                RAY

                      His brains were on the wall, Jesse. Like

                      somebody painted 'em.

            Jesse does another set. Weights BANG down. He slowly sits up.

                                JESSE

                      They come at you?

                                RAY

                      Not yet... But it's in the mail. I can

                      feel it fuckin' coming.

            Ray shoots a look at a group of ARYAN BROTHERS across the

            yard. CZAPP, their "leader," and ROACH. Jesse turns. Czapp

            looks at him. Eyes meet. Jesse leans back.

            The press shakes as Jesse does a last set. His red strained

            face as the bar lands with a CRASH.

            INT. YARD CORRIDOR, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY,

            LATER 

            A long line of prisoners are filing back through the gate.

            Ray, behind Jesse. Says low:

                                RAY

                      Hey, Jesse... 

                          (silence)

                      Sorry I put you back here. I never meant--

                                JESSE

                          (turns)

                      "Sorry", Raymond...? You ain't sorry.

                          (pause)

                      I took you into my home. I tried to clean

                      you up. And you steal from me...? You

                      take my fuckin' diamonds? 

                          (dead to rights)

                      'Cause of you, I missed the birth of my

                      son. 

            Ray swallows hard. Nothing he can say.

            INT. METRO OFFICE, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRECINCT - DAY

            CLOSE ON numerous files of ARYAN GANG MEMBERS. Arrest sheets,

            paperwork and photos.

                                BUD O.S.

                      Alright, let's work this...

                          (beat)

                      In prison, Wheeler is credited for the

                      expansion of the Brotherhood. When

                      Federal split up members, they had to

                      reorganize. So they tattooed their blood

                      types and serial numbers on one another.

                                COBB O.S.

                      Recede and multiply.

                                BUD O.S.

                      Exactly...

            REVEAL NOW Bud and Shepard with Cobb and Marandino around a

            table, used as a converted eating area. 

                                BUD

                      Put 'em in prison, they get stronger.

                      Everywhere you send one, they recruit in

                      numbers. Within five years, their numbers

                      were over ten thousand.

                                MARANDINO

                      Wheeler directed all that, huh?

            Shepard is flipping through a worn, thick file.

                                BUD

                      What do you got there, Shep'?

                                SHEPARD

                      Interpol wired us files on three known

                      Aryan leaders in the state of Louisiana:

                      Edgar Bingham. Harold Kay. And this

                      man... Lucian Adams.

            He opens the file, revealing mugshots of LUCIAN ADAMS, 51.

            Dark eyes. Sharp, gun metal features. 

                                SHEPARD

                      High priest of the Aryan National Party.

                      His "ministry" of Christian Identity and

                      Paramilitary Order has stood for over a

                      decade. Check this out...

            Shepard pulls an old, faded surveillance photo: (Long shot)

            Lucian talking to a young Jesse outside a compound.

                                SHEPARD

                      Wheeler was just seventeen when he met

                      Lucian at the Patriotic Congress.

                                MARANDINO

                      No shit.

                                SHEPARD

                      Today, Lucian's one hell of an

                      entrepreneur. Owns surplus stores.

                      Demolition. A piping business. Got trucks

                      runnin' all across the God damn country.

            Bud's been quiet; says now:

                                BUD

                      Stay focused. Get back to Wheeler... I

                      need an angle.

                                COBB

                      For what? If Wheeler ever flipped, news

                      would spread like wildfire. The AB's

                      gonna know about it. They'd gonna know

                      about it nationally.

                          (re: his coffee)

                      Pass the sugar.

            Marandino does.

                                BUD

                      That's if he was a surface informant. I

                      don't want him to testify. I want to keep

                      him on the street.

                          (to the group)

                      Look, this guy's been in it a long time.

                      He's up to his elbows; wants to shake his

                      hands free. I can feel it.

                                MARANDINO

                      Braddock ain't gonna go for this.

                                BUD

                      I'll handle that.

            Everyone looks to Bud.

                                BUD

                      We got one chance here. 'Cause if this

                      falls short... Jesse Wheeler's worth more

                      dead than alive.

            INT. CAFETERIA, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - EVENING

            A sea of tables divided by race as far as the eye can see.  

            Jesse and Ray, trays in hand, find an island of ARYAN

            PRISONERS. They quickly part to make room for Jesse to sit.

            Suddenly Czapp and Roach arrive with their trays and abruptly

            sit across from the Wheeler brothers.

                                CZAPP

                      How you doin', Ray?

                          (off Ray's look)

                      We was just over there wonderin' why you

                      ain't got the courtesy to introduce us to

                      your kin.

                                RAY

                      I was gonna.

                                CZAPP

                          (grins)

                      I'm sure you was.

            Czapp locks on Jesse, who calmly eats, not looking up.

                                CZAPP

                      Jesse Wheeler. Heard of you...

                                ROACH

                      Fuckin-A, heard a lot.

                                CZAPP

                      Name's Czapp... You can call me,

                      "Bossman."

                          (beat)

                      I kept an eye on your brother the past

                      few days for you. Ain't that right, Ray?

                                RAY

                          (low)

                      Yeah...

                                JESSE

                      My brother ain't none of your business.

                                CZAPP

                      Ain't none of my business, "Bossman." And

                      everything in this fuckin' place is my

                      business.

            Ray nervously glances down at several Aryans watching...

                                CZAPP

                          (to Jesse)

                      Listen to me, you sonofabitch. I'm gonna

                      make one God damn thing God damn clear.

                      Your reputation is smoke. Whatever they

                      say you is or once was, I don't give a

                      flyin' fuck. 'Cause it's my say-so now.

                      And your fuckin' brother's up for grabs.

            Czapp looks away from Jesse and shouts down the table:

                                CZAPP

                      Y'all got that?!

            Suddenly Jesse SPRINGS. A headbutt EXPLODES Czapp's nose and

            throws him back.

            Czapp's head hits linoleum, echoing with a CRACK!! He lies

            still. Bloodied and unconscious.

                                ROACH

                          (stumbles away, shocked)

                      Fuck...

            A DEAFENING SILENCE SPREADS OVER THE CAFETERIA.

            Jesse calmly resumes eating. Czapp's blood covers his face.

            SUDDENLY AN ALARM BLARES. GUARDS pour in, led by Murphy.

            INMATES HIT THE DECK, arms behind their heads. All except

            Jesse, who continues to eat.

                                MURPHY

                      WHEELER!!! Stand the fuck up! Hands

                      behind your head! 

            Jesse rises.

                                MURPHY

                      Hands behind your head! Get on the

                      fuckin' floor!

            Jesse puts his hands behind his head, but does not kneel.

            Restraints are slammed on Jesse's wrists. And we...

                                                           CUT TO BLACK.

            INT. ISOLATION, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - LATE NIGHT

            The door unlocks and drags open. Jesse turns, blinking

            painfully into the light ...Sees an imposing DUTY GUARD.

                                DUTY GUARD

                      Phone call.

            INT. GUARD STATION

            Jesse is led in. Duty Guard hits an extension button on a

            desk phone and offers the receiver...

            Jesse doesn't move.

                                DUTY GUARD

                      It's a secure line.

            Duty Guard walks out. Alone now, Jesse picks up the line...

                                JESSE

                          (into phone)

                      Yeah.

            A low, whiskey voice is HEARD over the line: LUCIAN ADAMS.

                                LUCIAN V.O.

                      Been a long time...

            Jesse shuts his eyes. There's a moment before he opens them.

                                LUCIAN V.O.

                      Read about the arrest, Jesse. There's a

                      lot of heat on this one.

                                JESSE

                      I don't want my brother touched.

                                LUCIAN V.O.

                          (laughs faintly)

                      I ain't callin' about your brother. I'm

                      callin' about you...

            Jesse turns SLOW to find the Duty Guard watching him from the

            hall. Lights a cigarette, stares.

                                LUCIAN V.O.

                      You should have come to me sooner, Jesse.

                      None of this would have happened.

                                JESSE

                      I'm askin' you, Lucian. My brother ain't

                      a problem.

                                LUCIAN V.O.

                      Your brother's a fuck up.

            And Jesse's quiet... Dead quiet...

                                LUCIAN V.O.

                      And Jesse... We may know what you can do.

                      But you know what we can do. Understand?

            Jesse hesitates, then Lucian hangs up. DIAL TONE.

            INT. BRADDOCK'S OFFICE - LATE NIGHT

            Room strewn with piles of casework. Bud, agitated, paces.

            Braddock, behind a desk. 

                                BRADDOCK

                      You're reachin', Bud. The leverage ain't

                      there.

                                BUD

                      It's there. It's gotta cook a little

                      longer, that's all.

                                BRADDOCK

                      Jesse won't so much as blink at doin'

                      life. The fuckin' guy didn't rise in the

                      ranks 'cause he skirts under pressure.

                          (beat)

                      There's no deal to be had.

                                BUD

                      C'mon, Mike, you know what's goin' on.

                      Ray Wheeler compromised Jesse. By that,

                      he compromised the Brotherhood. Don't

                      tell me there ain't no fuckin' leverage.

            Bud pours himself a cup of coffee.

                                BRADDOCK

                      We need somethin' more.

                      for the God damn phone to ring.

            Jesse is silent.

                                LYNN

                      You said we were done with this. That

                      they were out of our lives.

            The baby begins to CRY.

                                LYNN

                      We have no money, Jesse. Which means we

                      have no fucking food. ...Say something,

                      would you?

                                JESSE

                      It's gonna be okay.

                                LYNN

                      I'm afraid. I'm afraid for my life...

            The baby WAILING now.

                                LYNN

                          (quietly crying)

                      ...For our baby.

            TIGHT ON JESSE, for the first time, appearing powerless.

            As Lynn wipes tears, trembling in her seat, Jesse looks away

            from his son, and glances up...

            Behind a glass partition outlying the room, a MAN is watching

            them...

            BUD. Stark still. Fixing Jesse with a hard stare.

            INT. PROPERTY ROOM, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - LATER

            A CLERK passes Lynn her belongings through chain link. She

            wipes her eyes, holding the baby.

            The back bay doors open. Bud enters. Sleepless, wrinkled

            clothes.

                                BUD

                      Lynn Wheeler. We haven't been properly

                      introduced. I'm Detective Bud Carter.

                                LYNN

                      I know who you are.

                                BUD

                      You have a ride home?

                                LYNN

                      We took the bus.

            Bud peels a few bills from a fold, puts it on the counter.

                                BUD

                      Take a cab.

            Bud lays his card atop the bills, looks at Lynn.

                                BUD

                      'You need anything...anything at all. Be

                      sure to call me.

            They look at each other. She pulls her baby close. There's an

            unspoken moment. And Bud walks away... 

            Lynn waits till Bud is out of view. Then takes the money. And

            the card.

            INT. CELLBLOCK, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY

            A Guard buzzes Jesse through.

            PRISONERS line the tier. Smoking cigarettes. Looking out.

            Jesse walks past, enters...

            HIS CELL

            ...where Ray sleeps in shadow on the bottom bunk.

            Jesse pulls a Polaroid from his pocket: His infant son. He

            gazes at the photo for a beat, then brings it to Ray...

                                JESSE

                      Ray...

            No response. Jesse nudges his brother's shoulder. 

                                JESSE

                      Raymond, take a look.

            Jesse rolls him over. Ray is limp. A filthy SYRINGE imbedded

            his arm. Jaw slack. Eyes wide and vacant.

            THE PHOTO FLUTTERS FROM JESSE'S HAND TO THE FLOOR...

            Jesse lowers, pulling Ray to his arms. He shuts his eyes.

            Teeth clench. And as Jesse feels the bile rising, his massive

            frame begins to shake... Then we realize, he's crying... 

                                                               TIME CUT:

            EXT. LOADING DOCK, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DUSK

            Pouring rain. Ray's corpse is loaded onto an ambulance.

            INT. JESSE'S CELL - DUSK

            Jesse sits in shadow. Alone. And it's still...

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

            AFTER HOURS

            Jesse sleeps. Hand under the pillow. When there's a sound...

            His eyes SNAP OPEN to discover the silhouettes of SIX MEN,

            rushing into his cell...

            A LOADED SOCK swings out from Jesse's pillow, slams MAN #1 in

            the jaw with a CRACK!!

            On his feet, Jesse whips the sock around and whacks MAN #2's

            head against the concrete wall. He slumps down unconscious.

            A BLUNT OBJECT is rammed into Jesse's sternum. Another shot

            bangs his neck. The sock drops and a PADLOCK clatters out.

            With a final burst of energy, Jesse turns, SCREAMS and rushes

            MAN #3. Man #3 slams into the cell bars. CLANG!! Lights out.

            The remaining three Men attack. A series of blows rain down

            and Jesse sinks into their grip.

            HALL LIGHTS BUMP ON: NOW WE SEE, THESE "MEN" ARE GUARDS.

            More GUARDS pour in, led by Murphy. They yank Jesse from his

            cell and take him down the tier.

            Guards toss the cell in a thorough search. Mattress

            overturns. Shelves crash.

            INT. TIER

            PRISONERS move to their bars, SHOUTING and JEERING as Jesse

            is wrestled down the STAIRS to...

            THE LOWER TIER

            Jesse thrashes violently as the Guards slam him through a

            door into...

            A TUNNEL

            between cell blocks. The ROAR of prisoners recedes as Jesse's

            dragged into darkness getting darker.

            A DOOR SLAMS OPEN...

            INT. READY ROOM, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON

            ...THERE'S A FLASH OF LIGHT. We're in a windowless room.

            And Bud pouring coffee for two...

                                BUD

                      Want a cup of coffee?

            Jesse is handcuffed to the table. Guards are breathing hard.

                                JESSE

                      MOTHERFUCKER! This how you do things?

                                BUD

                      Yeah... When I want to talk to someone,

                      without giving the impression he's

                      cooperatin'.

            Jesse pauses, caught by Bud's tactics. The Guards file out

            and shut the door.

            Jesse's eyes are fierce and watching Bud's every movement as

            he hands him a coffee, then takes a seat...

                                BUD

                      You got a problem.

                                JESSE

                      Yeah, what's that?

                                BUD

                      To start with, you're lookin' at two

                      hundred years.

                                JESSE

                      I've done the time. I'll do it again.

                                BUD

                      I know you can do it. But can your

                      family?

            Jesse's face is tense. Unyielding.

                                BUD

                      Your brother's dead, Jesse. As we're

                      sittin' here now, he's on a slab at St.

                      Gabriel's Morgue. The coroner's callin'

                      it, "suicide". You and I both know that's

                      a load of shit.

                          (beat)

                      You do the time-- sure. And you never see

                      your kid. 'Cept in here. You can recruit

                      him. Your wife...plans...everything...

                      Gone.

                          (beat)

                      'Less you talk...to me.

            Jesse silent, a dark internal pause. He meets Bud's eyes

            across the table; then...

                                JESSE

                      Do you hate?

                                BUD

                      What?

            Jesse's sudden directness has caught Bud off-guard.

                                JESSE

                      Who do you hate the most? Blacks you

                      throw in prison?

                                BUD

                      ...I dislike what they represent in the

                      system. Not as a whole.

            And Jesse begins to consciously or unconsciously "preach."

                                JESSE

                      And you believe that by overthrowin'

                      Aryan nationalism and integratin'

                      races...polluted creeds, with us...You

                      believe you're solvin' somethin'?

                                BUD

                      I believe we survive by integrating

                      safety. Understanding hate, and how to

                      stop it.

                                JESSE

                      It ain't evil to fight it. It's evil to

                      tolerate it.

                          (leans in)

                      Maybe you forget that, to justify what

                      you do for a living...

                                BUD

                      Are we still in prison, or we back at the

                      compound, havin' mass?

                                JESSE

                      You don't get it.

                                BUD

                      No, don't dictate to me what put you in

                      here, or question my intentions with your

                      overcooked revolution!

                          (beat)

                      'Fact, I think you wanted out 'fore I

                      even got to you! That's why you distanced

                      yourself. That's why you're out there

                      crackin' safes. Lookin' to live a life

                      that ain't AB.

                                JESSE

                      In who I am, there's pressure! I work for

                      you, I won't need a lawyer, I'll need a

                      priest! My outside finance is gone... My

                      wife and son, their heads wind up

                      somewhere their bodies ain't! So tell me,

                      why the fuck should I get involved with

                      you?!

                                BUD

                      How about personal warranty?

                                JESSE

                      Warranty?!

                                BUD

                      Yeah, that's right! You've been a part of

                      the problem so long, you've forgotten

                      what the fuck that is!

                          (boaring in)

                      "Finance..." Your wife came here on a bus

                      to see you. I sent her home in a cab. Is

                      that your outside fuckin' finance?!

            Beat. Jesse, taken back.

                                BUD

                      Let me give you a little insight, pal. As

                      to what I know... And what you think you

                      know.

            Bud flips open a file and shoves a series of grainy B&W

            SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS in front of Jesse.

                                BUD

                      This is today...

            Photo #1: Outside Jesse's House. A distressed Lynn and the

            baby being led into a car by Catfish.  

                                BUD

                      Is that your house? That's your wife,

                      right? Who's this guy?

            Photo #2: Tight-shot of Catfish.

                                BUD

                          (off Jesse's look)

                      Know where he's takin' them? Takin' your

                      family? I got a pretty good fuckin' idea.

            Photo #3: An anonymous duplex. Catfish escorting Lynn and the

            baby inside, past several surly Aryans looking on.

            Jesse finally averts his eyes... 

                                BUD

                      Look at your wife, Jesse. Look at her

                      face. And your son. They look safe to

                      you?  

                          (a moment)

                      I'm all you've got! I'm all your family's

                      got! And the longer you're in here,

                      they're up for grabs.  

            ON JESSE. The wheels turning. Burning. THE CAMERA MOVES IN...

                                BUD

                      So either you let that happen... Or I get

                      the judge to allow bond. This never sees

                      trial. And you work for me. 

            And that's where it hangs...

                                                                  BLACK.

            FADE IN:

            INT. COURTROOM, BATON ROUGE - DAY

            Jesse rises, wearing a suit. JUDGE PONDER, at the bench,

            presides over this arraignment hearing:

                                JUDGE PONDER

                      You stand accused of forty counts of

                      burglary, twenty nine counts of felony

                      theft, possession of illegal firearms,

                      possession or dealing in unregistered

                      weapons, possession of a controlled

                      incendiary devices, and seventeen counts

                      of receiving stolen goods... How do you

                      plead?

            CUT TO DANIEL KIERSEY, 40s, sharp, confident, expensively

            dressed. Jesse's attorney, rising:

                                KIERSEY

                      Not guilty, Your Honor.

                                JUDGE PONDER

                      Let's hear the arguments for bail.

            The DISTRICT ATTORNEY rises from his seat:

                                DISTRICT ATTORNEY

                      Your honor, this man is an habitual felon

                      as well as a flight risk. Our office has

                      overwhelming evidence that Mr. Wheeler is

                      not only guilty, but also a serious

                      threat to the community. The State

                      recommends that bail be denied.

                                KIERSEY

                      Your honor, my client deserves a

                      reasonable bail. He has every intention

                      of appearing and answering to all these

                      false charges. In addition, he is the

                      sole provider for his wife and newborn

                      child, who would suffer undo hardship if

                      this man were incarcerated.

            CUT TO Judge Ponder:

                                JUDGE PONDER

                      Bond is set at one million.

            THE GAVEL BANGS DOWN. Kiersey shakes Jesse's hand. Smiles:

                                KIERSEY

                      Congratulations.

            REVEAL BUD -- seated in back, watching the proceedings.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. BEDROOM, JESSE'S HOUSE - PRE DAWN

            Lynn, asleep in bed... 

            INT. HALLWAY

            Jesse stands, holding his son, quietly comforting him. When

            Jesse turns, WE SEE a .45 tucked in his back.

            AND THE PHONE RINGS...

                                JESSE

                          (answers)

                      Yeah...

            STATIC; he listens, then:

                                JESSE

                          (into phone)

                      Okay.

            EXT. BACKYARD, JESSE'S HOUSE - PRE DAWN

            Jesse steps through his fence into deep WOODS, to find a CAR

            waiting idyll on a dirt road. 

            INT. CAR - PRE DAWN

            A HEAVY-SET MAN at the wheel. Jesse gets in as the headlights

            spin on and the car pulls away... 

            EXT. SHIPYARD - PRE DAWN

            Dark. Eerie and desolate. The car arrives. Jesse steps out

            and disappears into the shadows of a towering crane.

            On the jetty, a nondescript MAN stands alone against the calm

            Mississippi. His back is to us. 

            Jesse approaches, stands quietly beside him.

                                MAN'S VOICE

                      How's your family?

            We realize now...It's Bud.

                                JESSE

                      Let's get somethin' straight. I ain't

                      here 'cause I'm scared. I done what I

                      did, 'cause certain people crossed the

                      line. They didn't keep their word.

                                BUD

                      Well my word counts.

            They stand together, facing the liquid horizon...  

                                BUD

                      I want a body, Jesse.

                                JESSE

                      How many you want?

            Bud finally looks at Jesse.

            EXT. BORROW PITS - DAWN 

            A swamp area used as a mud retrieval source for the levy.

            Amite River. FOG OBSCURES NEARLY EVERYTHING.

            Jesse slowly emerges... Then Bud and Metro, on all sides, MAG-

            LIGHTS, FLAK JACKETS and SHOTGUNS. A DUFFEL BAG of SHOVELS.

            The sounds of the swamp are terrifying. Herons and bobcats.

            Boots hitting water. The buzz of a million mosquitos.

            SUDDENLY A RUSHING SOUND -- An ALLIGATOR shoves off the mire.

                                COBB

                      'The fuck is that?

            Cobb's light catches the tail whipping into the swamp.

                                BUD

                      Yard dog. Relax.

                                SHEPARD

                      Where's this motherfucker taking us?

            Jesse suddenly STOPS. LISTENS. BREATHES. Bud and Metro stare.

                                JESSE

                          (directly to Bud)

                      Dig here.

            Metro exchanges looks, ANXIOUS. Bud nods "okay".

                                                                TIMECUT:

            EXT. JESSE'S BORROW PIT

            Metro engulfed in fog. Picks and shovels rise and fall.

                                MARANDINO

                      Bud! We hit something!

            Bud excitedly descends the pit to scrape gravel from metal.

                                BUD

                      Clear it off! Come on, find the edges!

            Jesse watches as a pair of STEEL DRUMS emerge.

            INT. STATE POLICE AUTOPSY ROOM - MID MORNING

            The "cold room". Bud and Braddock watch as two PATHOLOGISTS

            hose down the drums. The stench is horrible.

                                BRADDOCK

                      How long they been down there?

                                BUD

                      Jesse tells me six months.

                                BRADDOCK

                      Six months? Bud, they're biodegraded by

                      now. Fuckin' worm food.

                                BUD

                      We'll get an ID. Remember, we got the guy

                      who put 'em there.

            BLOW TORCHES ROAR as Pathologists burn through the drums.

            Sparks fly. The lids CRASH. Swamp water floods out... And

            immersed within: two sore-covered, DECOMPOSING BODIES.

            The room recoils from the fumes.

            INT. KITCHEN, JESSE'S HOUSE - DAY

            Lynn is putting dishes away. The baby nearby, sleeps quietly

            in a swing. Lynn gazes out the window...

            EXT. DRIVEWAY, JESSE'S HOUSE

            Jesse is under the hood of his truck, fixing the engine...

            When a '71 Mustang, white-on-white, roars up the street. 

            Jesse glances over as the car pulls alongside the driveway.  

            It's CATFISH, at the wheel. A wolfish grin.

                                CATFISH

                      'Bout time to get a new truck there,

                      Jesse.

            Jesse tightens a nut with a torque wrench, says nothing.

                                CATFISH

                      Good to see you out. A free man now.

                                JESSE

                      What's goin' on, 'Fish?

                                CATFISH

                      On a Sunday drive, that's all. The good

                      Lord ridin' shotgun, through another

                      glorious Louisiana mornin'.

            Jesse EYES his .45 atop the engine block, within reach. 

                                CATFISH

                      Say, Jesse... Lucian's askin' about you.

                      Fact, a lot of people are.  

            Jesse stays on the engine, never turns around.

                                JESSE

                      You tell him I'll come by.

                                CATFISH

                          (no longer smiling)

                      That's good. I'll see you real soon then.

            As Catfish drives away... We HEAR a series of photos being

            taken at high-speed. FREEZE FRAME to BLACK & WHITE.

            PULL BACK to a distant CONSTRUCTION TRAILER. Bud with a long

            lens camera, triggers snapshots. 

            INT. DINER - DAY

            Greasy spoon, soul food joint. Trucker and labor patrons.

            Bud walks in, perplexed to find Braddock sitting with   

            MARTIN FITCH (30), Deputy Chief of Staff for US Attorney

            General. Pressed suit. Young face. Out of his element.

                                BUD

                      Hey, Mike.

                                BRADDOCK

                      Bud, this is Special Agent, Martin Fitch.

                      He's down from Washington. With the

                      Attorney General.

                                FITCH

                      Martin. Just call me Martin.

            Fitch offers his hand, smiles. Bud shakes.

                                BRADDOCK

                      Martin's gonna be soliciting Jesse's case

                      for a Federal sponsor.

                                BUD

                      How long you been with the Attorney

                      General, Fitch?

                                FITCH

                      Just over a year.

            Bud looks at Braddock.

                                FITCH

                      I want to assure you my education and

                      experience is more than adequate to

                      handle a case of this potential.

                                BUD

                      Is that right...

            Fitch's smile drops as Bud stares him down.

                                BRADDOCK

                      Why don't we get to the particulars?

                                FITCH

                      Right. Alright.

                          (clears throat)

                      To get Jesse a federal sponsor, we need

                      something substantial. A bait. In the

                      Justice Department, we have this mission

                      statement... We decide who the target is,

                      what's the threat assessment, the cost

                      value, over what time table it's gonna

                      take place... Which target do we go after

                      first. We don't want to miss a big target

                      hitting a smaller target, you understand?

                                BUD

                      No.

                                FITCH

                      Well, exposing bodies has limitations.

                      Those people are dead. We can't retrieve

                      their lives.

            Bud blinks.

                                BRADDOCK

                      He means there might not be enough to

                      back Jesse.

                                BUD

                      Keep him on the street without

                      protection, he winds up dead.

                                FITCH

                      What I'm saying is, we need fresh leads.

                      He'll need to present something that

                      separates him from those we're going to

                      arrest. If Jesse can't offer something

                      continuous... I'm afraid we can't be of

                      much help.

            Bud stares at Fitch. 

            A WAITRESS in her 50s approaches. 

                                WAITRESS

                      Ready to order?

                                FITCH

                          (cuts in)

                      Yes. I'll take a garden salad. Roquefort

                      on the side.

                                WAITRESS

                      You'll take what?

                                FITCH

                          (curt)

                      It's a dressing. 

                                WAITRESS

                      Well...we got ranch, thousand island and

                      oil. Which one you want?

            Bud's chair SCRAPES back as he stands, stares hard at Fitch:

                                BUD

                      Lost my appetite.

            And walks out.

            EXT. PARKING LOT OUTSIDE DINER - DAY

            Bud stalks out to his car. Braddock follows, agitated. They

            say nothing till they reach the car.

                                BUD

                      I set this up. Me and Jesse. If the Feds

                      want to help, that's fine. But not him.

                                BRADDOCK

                      What do you mean, "me and Jesse?" He's

                      not your partner, Bud. This case is

                      beyond our capacity. It requires

                      resources we don't have.

            Bud unlocks the car. They stand, talking across the roof.

                                BUD

                      They ain't takin' us serious, Mike. They

                      send us some kid with a year under his

                      belt?! He don't even know what state he's

                      in... You want him in charge?!

                                BRADDOCK

                      You're God damn right I do! You're out on

                      a limb on this already, Bud! It's my job

                      to make sure you get back!

                                BUD

                      This is bullshit.

                                BRADDOCK

                      That may be. What it ain't, is open for

                      discussion.

            Braddock walks away. Bud simmers a moment, gets in his car.

            INT. A ROOM - FOLLOWING MORNING

            A bare room; nothing to tell us where we are. Jesse's on a

            stool. He runs his fingers down his mustache, grits his teeth.

                                JESSE

                      Y'all wanna talk about crime? Well I

                      could tell y'all things. Names.

                      Locations. What boat is movin' what

                      drugs, which one is guns. Who's gonna get

                      cut up and why. ...But what I got to know

                      is, if 'n when I do this... If I wear

                      your dog collar... Y'all gonna do what's

                      right by me and keep my head from gettin'

                      shot the fuck off? 'Cause the truth is,

                      you need me. You ain't got enough cops

                      with enough sense or enough time, to

                      clear them crimes that already been

                      committed and will be.

                          (pause)

                      Y'all need me... I got the devil's

                      address.

            REVERSE: We're in a HOTEL SUITE.

            Shades down. Full of AGENTS: FBI, ATF, DEA, SECRET SERVICE.

            Law enforcement everywhere. On the furniture, against the

            wall, sitting on the floor. Staring at Jesse in silence.

            Bud stands by the door with Braddock. And Fitch steps

            forward, laughs nervously...

                                FITCH

                      Okay, great... Thanks. Thank you, Jesse,

                      for that. And thank you, everyone for

                      attending...

                          (tight)

                      Uh, we all know why we're here. To solve

                      a matter of custody--

                                FBI #1

                      We'll protect you and your family, Jesse.

                          (to the room)

                      It's a federal matter, gentlemen. Those

                      bodies were transported over state lines.

            An ATF AGENT #1 imposes:

                                ATF #1

                      Not so fast. Ammunition, grenades? This

                      man's house was a factory, for Christ's

                      sake. ATF is taking this.

                                DEA

                      Those murders were drug related. DEA's

                      got to do follow ups.

                                SECRET SERVICE

                      He was printing counterfeit money. 

                      That's Secret Service.

            ARGUING ENSUES, Agents' voices step over one another. Fitch

            tries to take control. Jesse's been silent, until...

                                JESSE

                      There's a hit list.

            Fitch hears this. He turns, loudly to the room...

                                FITCH

                      Wait! Wait a minute, quiet! Everyone

                      quiet!

            And EVERYTHING stops. Fitch moves to Jesse:

                                FITCH

                      A what?

                                JESSE

                      A hit list. There's much as twelve. Might

                      be one or two less now, I ain't sure.

                      Some could've already been gotten.

                                BUD

                          (to Braddock)

                      Now we're talkin'.

            FBI #2 approaches Jesse...

                                FBI #2

                      Why these twelve, Jesse?

                                JESSE

                      Different reasons. It ain't so much why

                      or what they done that matters. Pick any

                      one of 'em off that list, AB puts you on

                      salary.

            Everyone is suddenly interested. Bud sees this.

                                JESSE

                      And you, sir, if I ain't mistaken...

                      You're Mr. Nokes, right?

            Agents part, revealing JOHN NOKES(50s), black, an emminent 

            figurehead in a plush suit. Surprised to be pointed out...

                                JESSE

                      First U.S. Attorney, John Nokes?

                                NOKES

                      That's right.

                                JESSE

                      Well, last time I seen it...you was

                      number two on that list.

            It's quiet. Nokes thinks. Then LAUGHS and approaches Jesse.

                                NOKES

                      Can you fill us in on the rest of those

                      names, Jesse?

                                JESSE

                      Yes, I can. But there's something I gotta

                      make clear 'fore that happens.

                                NOKES

                      What's that?

                                JESSE

                      I've listened to you, Mr. Nokes. And I've

                      listened to these suits here, on who's

                      gonna take me in...

                          (beat)

                      I will die, go to hell and take all y'all

                      cocksuckers with me, if he--

                          (motions to Bud)

                      --tells me to.

                          (beat)

                      I want y'all to know that.

            Jesse is explosive under the low projection delivery and a

            CHILL falls over the room.

                                NOKES

                          (to Bud)

                      How's that fly by you, Lieutenant?

            Bud simply nods.

                                NOKES

                      I'll sponsor him. Jesse's welfare will

                      come out of our budget. Anyone has

                      pending cases or leads for Jesse, see me.

                      I'll loan him out.

            Jesse stares at Nokes. As the meeting settles back to a

            comfortable level...

                                NOKES

                      And, Jesse... I'm a little pissed I'm

                      number two on that list. Who the fuck is

                      number one?

            The room erupts with LAUGHTER. Everyone except Bud and Jesse.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

            EXT. GRAND COUTEAU - DAY

            Jesse's truck moves over an old wooden bridge through

            sweeping fields that stretch to a vast, wooded area.

            EXT. FRONT GATES, PRIVATE PROPERTY - DAY

            Jesse stops at a long drive protected by locked iron gates.

            A surveillance camera zooms in. Jesse looks up. A second

            camera pans on Jesse, staring...

            MOVE IN as crackling, electronic pixels FILL THE FRAME and... 

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. GUARD STATION - SAME

            A BANK OF MONITORS showing Jesse at the gates. A GUARD sits

            in shadow, hits a button: We see the gates unlock and open.

            INT. JESSE'S TRUCK

            pulls down the private road.

            Shafts of light mottle then burst, REVEALING an elegant

            VICTORIAN HOME. 

            Jesse parks -- walks up the porch, where Catfish is relaxing,

            shoulder holster, revolver. And Buzz, cleaning a pistol.

                                BUZZ

                      Jesse.

            Jesse nods, eyes Catfish.

                                JESSE

                      I'm here to see Lucian.

            Catfish grinds out his cigarette, gets to his feet.

                                CATFISH

                      He's busy right now; You can come in and

                      wait.

            INT. LUCIAN ADAMS' OFFICE - DAY

            CLOSE ON: A SNIFTER

            as Louis XIII pours to the rim. From elsewhere in the room:

                                MALE VOICE

                      This operation of your's has become big

                      business. You need relationships now more

                      than ever...

            THE VOICE belongs to RICHARD MORRIS, 40s. He sits in a

            leather chair, facing Lucian Adams, who's face we cannot see. 

            Seated next to Morris, is Daniel Kiersey.

                                MORRIS

                      ...We've done business successfully

                      before, Mr. Adams. But it's a larger

                      scope now. I'm here today because I want

                      to represent you exclusively. You need

                      someone lobbying at a state level, as

                      well as in Washington. My organization

                      can provide both. We've got contacts that

                      you don't have and other people can't

                      get. Now, I'm aware that you have

                      multiple businesses... However you need

                      one go-to guy, so that all your ventures

                      stay coordinated and all transactions and

                      contracts are realized. I am that person,

                      Mr. Adams. That's what I do.

            LUCIAN'S HAND lifts the cognac out of frame, drinks.

                                KIERSEY

                      What's this going to cost us?

                                MORRIS

                      As a retainer, I want an advance of three

                      hundred-fifty thousand, along with ten

                      percent of whatever economic benefit I

                      bring to this organization.

                                KIERSEY

                      Three-fifty? C'mon, Dick. That's out of

                      line.

                                MORRIS

                      If you want a quality global economic

                      plan, that's what you pay for-- 

                                LUCIAN O.S.

                      We'll give you two, Mr. Morris...That's

                      what it's worth.

            Morris goes suddenly silent, looks across at Lucian.

                                LUCIAN O.S.

                      The advance is a drop in the bucket. The

                      real money is the percentage. It's in

                      your interest to see it my way.

            Morris stares across the desk, several tense moments. Then:

                                MORRIS

                      You've got a deal.

            INT. LIVING ROOM, LUCIAN ADAMS' HOUSE - DAY

            Morris emerges from the office. He glances at Jesse, then

            shrugs on his coat and leaves... 

            Jesse looks back at the office doorway. FOLLOW Jesse in...

            INT. LUCIAN ADAM'S OFFICE

            ...past Kiersey, behind a massive desk in this impeccable

            room, we finally SEE LUCIAN ADAMS.

            Jesse is not invited to sit.

                                LUCIAN

                          (to Kiersey)

                      Give us a minute.

            Kiersey walks out and shuts the door... 

            ON LUCIAN

            he crosses slowly to a credenza, selects a clean shirt.

                                LUCIAN

                      You have a son now, right?

                                JESSE

                      Yeah...

            As he removes the shirt he's wearing, REVEAL tattoos: BLACK

            SUN on his back. GERMAN RUNES, SS BOLTS, HRUNGNIR'S HEART.

            And around his stomach, a belt of NORSE GODS with the words,

            "INVISIBLE EMPIRE." Prison tats, dark and aged.

                                LUCIAN

                      What'd you name him?

                                JESSE

                      I named him Ray.

            Lucian, no emotion, puts on a pressed dress shirt, fastens

            cuff-links.

                                LUCIAN

                          (over his shoulder)

                      Heard the cops smacked you around inside.

                                JESSE

                      'Wasn't too bad.

            Lucian checks his hair.

                                LUCIAN

                      You've been a busy man, Jesse. More ways

                      than one.

                                JESSE

                      Looks like you done just fine without me.

                      Business rollin' through the door.

            And Lucian finally turns; looks at Jesse, eyes measuring...

                                LUCIAN

                      Last I saw you, you asked for time. Time

                      to raise a family.

                      Time to straighten things out. 

                          (pause)

                      I gave you that time... Then safe jobs

                      start poppin' up. Lafayette. New Orleans.

                      Clinton. Baton Rouge. All over. The boys,

                      they think it's niggers, gone widespread

                      on a hunt for pig's feet. But they all

                      professional. Burn jobs. Hot-weld oxygen.

                      Laid out, burned, laid back, perfect.

                          (locked on Jesse)

                      I knew right then and there, only a white

                      respectable burglar could've done this.

            Jesse smiles slightly. They know each other well...

            ...When Lucian's smile suddenly drops. There's a flash of

            controlled anger across his face; and WE FEEL a curtain of

            tension fall heavily on the room.

                                LUCIAN

                      Jesse... With all the work you been

                      doin': Diamonds. Emeralds. A dozen safe

                      jobs, behind my back...

                          (predatory)

                      Where's the tribute to the greater cause?

            Jesse he pulls from his pocket, a tiny pouch. Sets it on the

            desk...

            He pours the contents into Lucian's palm: DIAMONDS and

            EMERALDS.

                                JESSE

                      Like I said, I just needed time.

            Lucian approaches the desk, opens the pouch: DIAMONDS and

            EMERALDS... A slow smile spreads across his face.

                                LUCIAN

                      Well, even prophets stumble once in a

                      while.

            Lucian embraces Jesse. Tight. Then, softly in his ear:

                                LUCIAN

                      It's a shame about your brother.

            As they part, their eyes meet. Something passes between

            them...

            I/E. JESSE'S TRUCK, TRAVELING - BACK ROAD - NIGHT

            Jesse at the wheel, glances nervously in the rearview. Lynn

            in the passenger seat, baby in her lap. They're driving under

            the cover of darkness... 

                                LYNN

                      I don't understand. Why do we have to

                      leave the state? You're not tellin' me

                      something. You're not tellin' me a lot.

                                JESSE

                      It ain't safe here no more. You wanted

                      out? This is out.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. PRIVATE AIRSTRIP - NIGHT

            Marandino looks through BINOCULARS: As an electric fence

            slides back. Jesse's truck approaches, drives through.

            EXT. RUNWAY - NIGHT

            A twin-engine PLANE idylls. Lines of blue lights, strobe like

            rivers, air traffic above... And Bud, leaning against a

            nearby car with Shepard and Cobb.

            Jesse helps Lynn and the baby from his truck. Together, they

            walk toward the plane...

            Bud, watching from a distance, nods to Lynn.

            OUTSIDE THE PLANE

            Jesse and Lynn stare at each other. She's crying as he pulls

            her close, one arm around the baby. He says something to them

            we cannot hear...

            Then with the baby, Lynn boards her plane. An AGENT shuts the

            door. The engine SCREAMS to life, taking off...

            Jesse turns to shield his face. Lights STROBE and BLAST...

            Then, ABRUPT DARKNESS AND SILENCE... 

            ON JESSE

            now alone on the tarmac. Bud approaches; then...

                                JESSE

                      Lucian took the stones. Talked about

                      jobs. High-end, boxcar.

                                BUD

                      Your family's safe now.

                          (beat)

                      Let's go to work.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. JEWELRY STORE BASEMENT - NIGHT

            Several AB SOLDIERS stand watch as Jesse pushes a heavy, 10"

            drill through a jeweler's vault door... Jesse throws tumbler

            and relock mechanisms aside, reaches in... jewels, gems.

            EXT. PARKING LOT - BETWEEN CARS - NIGHT

            Bud and Jesse parked next to each other, trading info.

            E/I. VARIOUS HIDEOUTS - NIGHT

            AB counterfeiting bills... Printing press and metal plates...

            Hands stain bills with coffee grounds and cigarettes, then

            industrial dryers... Jesse at a table behind tall stacks of

            cash, inspecting, approving...

            INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT

            Bud with Jesse. Info, names and written amounts.

            INSERTS: HANDS file serial numbers off guns... HANDS building

            silencers... loading guns in suitcases below false bottoms...

            EXT. PAY PHONES - NIGHT

            Jesse on the line... Bud on the other end, taking notes...

            INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

            AB Soldiers unload crates from trucks, "Chrysler Corp."...

            "Remington Firearms"... Antique furniture... Machinery...

            INSERT: A MONEY MACHINE counts large denominations of cash.

            EXT. BELOW AN OVERPASS - NIGHT

            Parked under the interstate. Bud looks over Jesse's info.

            EXT. NEW ORLEANS PORT - NIGHT

            A large fishing boat arrives. Numerous Fisherman load marlin

            onto refrigerated trucks... Catfish, Buzz, numerous AB start

            up the trucks... Jesse hands the Head Fisherman a canvas bag

            of cash... 

            PULL BACK to reveal Shepard, Cobb and Marandino on the roof

            of a neighboring port, snapping photos. Taking notes.

            E/I. ISOLATED BARN - NIGHT

            Trucks arrive. AB bring the marlin inside... Atop a crate,

            Jesse slices a marlin open, revealing kilos of cocaine. More

            marlins are cut. More cocaine.

            INT. METRO OFFICE - DAY

            Bud on the typewriter, hammering out Jesse's contacts and

            movements. Files piling on his desk.

            INT. METRO OFFICE - NIGHT

            An organizational chart, as Bud pins AB mug shots, arrest

            sheets and surveillance photos wall to wall.

            Bud steps back, observes. His case building. Getting huge.

                                                         MONTAGE OUT/TO:

            EXT. BACK PATIO, LUCIAN'S HOUSE - DAY

            Wood secluded. Lucian, Jesse and Kiersey sit around a table.

                                KIERSEY

                      There's a variety of matters to discuss

                      today, gentlemen. Eddie Moran's trial

                      starts next week. One of the jurors

                      reached out. He's asking six thousand up

                      front plus a job at four hundred a week.

                      That guarantees a hung jury with a push

                      for an acquittal.  

                                LUCIAN

                      Three hundred. Give him a no-show at the

                      trucking firm.

                                KIERSEY

                          (as he writes)

                      Construction on the building Morris

                      brought us, in south-east Florida, is

                      complete. Every unit sold. We should see

                      revenues of one point four million over

                      our original projections. 

            Lucian lights a cigar, smoke curls from his lips.

                                KIERSEY

                      Lastly, our "friends" from the Middle

                      East. They put a final offer on the

                      table. They'll fund our operation in

                      Louisiana if we agree to act on their

                      behalf. Political targets mostly, on the

                      basis of our approval...

                          (beat)

                      I advise we do a test case. Perhaps a

                      sample of their resources.

                                LUCIAN

                      "Final offer?" Demands... 

                          (beat)

                      Close the deal. We'll cook the cash for

                      it. By the time they realize, we'll have

                      our return.

                          (laughs to Jesse)

                      You believe they're travelin' all the way

                      to Louisiana just to get fuckin' robbed?

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. LUCIAN'S BACK YARD - LATER

            Jesse and Lucian walk together through green, expansive

            countryside. A pair of Arabian mares graze nearby.

                                LUCIAN

                      I want you runnin' point on this one...  

                                JESSE

                      I'll be honest, I was hopin' for

                      somethin' bigger.

                                LUCIAN

                      What do you got in mind?

                                JESSE

                      How 'bout a few of them heads off the

                      list?

                                LUCIAN

                      We got guys for that now. Catfish, Buzz.

                      What do you want to go back to that for?

                                JESSE

                      The money's worth twice this. Bring back

                      a head it's fifteen grand; Bring a heart,

                      it's thirty, right?

            Lucian looks at Jesse, who feels Lucian's scrutiny.

                                LUCIAN

                      Tell you what. Do this other thing we got

                      lined up...

                          (beat)

                      Then I'll give you that taste.

            EXT. HENDERSON INDUSTRIAL ZONE - ESTABLISH - NIGHT

            Dark, factory skyline. Burnt out cars sit before a WAREHOUSE.

            INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

            HEADQUARTERS for the Baton Rouge operation. A beehive of

            government activity. TECHNICIANS listen to tapes... PHONES

            ring off the hook... Bud and Fitch going over the case:

                                FITCH

                      There's pressure from Washington. They

                      send compliments for Jesse's work. But

                      our primary concern is that list. I need

                      names we can protect.

                                BUD

                      We know that, Fitch. He's workin' on it.

                                FITCH

                      If Jesse can just get a direct order...

                      from Lucian to him, on a wire--

                                BUD

                      --A wire?! He just went back to work, you

                      want him to wear a fuckin' wire?

                          (beat)

                      Put a tap on that God damn lawyer's

                      phone, that's what you should do.

                                FITCH

                      He's an attorney, Carter. Anything we get

                      would be inadmissable.

                                BUD

                      It's information, Fitch. 

            Fitch, annoyed, but staying on track.

                                FITCH

                      Bud. We need Jesse to engage Lucian on

                      the record. Otherwise it's just hearsay.

                      He's disconnected from everything, like a

                      ghost. 

            Bud, cooling his heels. As the phones RING and RING...

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

            A violent rainfall.

            AERIAL SHOT swooping along the HIGHWAY, then rising above the

            deep woods to reveal a TRUCK STOP ahead.

            EXT. TRUCK STOP - NIGHT

            Closed for construction. A VAN arrives. A blinking barricade

            is pulled back, allowing entrance...

            Generators light the scene: A group of SHIITE MUSLIMS wait by

            a pair of idle FREIGHT TRUCKS. A crew of five AB SOLDIERS

            exit the van: Jesse, Catfish and Buzz among them.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. LUMBER STORAGE, TRUCK STOP - NIGHT

            The door to one Freight truck rolls to the top, revealing a

            converted ASSAULT WEAPONRY SHOWCASE.

            Below covered scaffolding, both crews stand. Guns bulge

            through their coats. No talking. No sudden movement. 

            Shiites watch Jesse and Catfish examine the merchandise: SEMI

            AUTOMATICS, SHOTGUNS, CARBINES, SUB-MACHINE GUNS...

            Everyone looks at each other. Jesse acknowledges worth.

            Catfish pulls a large CANVAS BAG from the van, filled with

            cash. As he carries it toward a bench, a large Shiite (OMAR)

            reaches for the bag before Catfish can set it down... 

            ...Both men hold tight. Neither letting go. And there's a

            moment.

                                JESSE

                          (low)

                      Catfish.

            Catfish and Omar are eye-to-eye. Then, Catfish lets go with a

            smile:

                                CATFISH

                      Go 'head. Count it.

            The Shiite leader, NASEEM, sees the strife.

                                NASEEM

                      There a problem?

                                JESSE

                      No problem. Money's all there.

            Omar hands the bag to Naseem. The count starts. Both crews

            watch closely...  

            ...All except Catfish, fixated on Omar, who stares back.

                                CATFISH

                      'The fuck you lookin' at...?

            The count stops. Naseem looks to Omar. Questions in Arabic go

            back and forth. The pressure getting to the group...

                                JESSE

                          (low)

                      Catfish, would you shut the fuck up? This

                      ain't the time.

                                NASEEM

                          (to Catfish)

                      Yes, listen to your boss.

                                CATFISH

                      What?! What fuckin' "boss?" You best

                      watch your ass, sand nigger.  

                                NASEEM

                      Piece of shit--!

            Everyone reaches for their guns. Threats SHOUTED in Arabic

            and English.

                                JESSE

                      Take it easy! Take it easy! 

            SUDDENLY ARC LIGHTS BEHIND A DISTANT BARRIER IGNITE, flooding

            the scene. Everyone turns.

                                A VOICE

                          (over a loud speaker)

                      ATF! THE PERIMETER'S SURROUNDED!

            Omar reaches for the bag of cash...

            BLAM! Catfish FIRES, point blank, shooting Omar in the face.

            And World War III erupts.

            AB's FIRE. Shiites RETURN FIRE. From several stakeout

            locations, ATF AGENTS deploy and OPEN FIRE.

            Jesse is grazed in the shoulder, slips, staggers-runs.

            SHIITE #1 FIRES THREE SHOT BURSTS at AB #1, who's blown

            apart. A generator and ATF #1 collapse.

            ATF #2 and #3 with pump shotguns OPEN UP on the AB's van.

            Naseem, over a Mercedes roof, FIRES A BURST at ATF, then

            swings onto AB #2 and FIRES, killing him. Naseem jumps into

            the Mercedes, yells at the DRIVER to go.

            Buzz RAPID FIRES, hits Shiite #1 in the back. Shiite #1 is

            spun around and Buzz shoots him in the head.

            Catfish FIRES into the lot... Hitting SHIITE #2.

            IN THE MERCEDES, Driver floors it. ATF re-emerges, kneels and

            PUMPS SHOTS into the Mercedes.

            Jesse has taken off, past the lumber storage. Catfish and

            Buzz follow, breaking for the Freight truck.

            IN THE MERCEDES, Driver is blown apart by ATF. The car

            CRASHES into a dumpster, knocking Naseem out.

            Jesse, Catfish and Buzz jump into the Freight. ATF FIRES.

            WINDOWS EXPLODE. SHIITE #3, trying to climb in is shot down.

            Jesse, behind the wheel... BURNS rubber pulling out of the

            stop, over and through a scaffold, collapsing it.

            The Freight truck draws everyone's FIRE. Jesse pilots it

            through the CHAOS. Scaffold DRAGGING behind. Sparks fly.

            JESSE'S POV: Where he's going. An opening in the

            construction, leads back to the HIGHWAY and ONCOMING TRAFFIC.

            ATF CARS speeds in, the opposite way...

            AS THE VEHICLES PASS: JESSE AND ATF

            lock eyes. And the Freight makes the highway, scattering

            traffic, to the sound of ongoing GUNFIRE...

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. DESOLATE FIELD - LATE NIGHT

            The moon hangs low as Jesse parks the Freight truck among

            tall grass, where a vacant BREAD TRUCK is waiting.

                                                                TIMECUT:

            As Catfish exits the truck...

            ...Jesse takes Catfish's gun, grabs him by the neck and SLAMS

            him against the cab. FACE TO FACE.

                                JESSE

                      You're a piece of work, Catfish.

            Buzz grabs at Jesse; Jesse HURLS him to the ground.

                                CATFISH

                      Them niggers crossed the line...I had to

                      burn 'em--

                                JESSE

                      --You had to keep your mouth shut! On a

                      job, you don't do fuckin' shit 'less I

                      say!

                                CATFISH

                      'The fuck off me--!

            Jesse slams him back again. HOLDS his throat.

                                JESSE

                          (low, deadly)

                      Fuck me up again, you hear me? I'll leave

                      you where I find you. Got that?

            PAUSE. Catfish glares, then concedes. 

                                JESSE

                      Unload the fuckin' truck.

            Jesse starts moving crates from the Freight onto the bread

            truck. Catfish and Buzz watch for a moment, then join.

            INT. FBI WAREHOUSE - LATE NIGHT

            Televisions broadcast news coverage of the shoot-out. AGENTS

            work, uncomfortable, as Bud and Fitch argue. Explosive...

                                FITCH

                      Keep your voice down! This was out of my

                      control!

                                BUD

                      I'm telling you, your agents best pull

                      their shit together! Who the hell y'all

                      trying to protect?!

                                FITCH

                      Look, Carter. This is a joint task force

                      with multiple agendas, that run up the

                      chain of command through me. Intel came

                      forth at the eleventh hour that Naseem

                      Kazuri - an international arms dealer -

                      would be present at this meet. ATF was

                      tasked to observe and report. 

                                BUD

                      That ain't what they did--!

                                FITCH

                      --No! Because your informant--

                                BUD

                      My informant, that's right!--

                                FITCH

                      --Your informant and his psychopath crew

                      greased half our political interests --

                      over a bag of fake cash! You weren't

                      informed, so what?

                                BUD

                      Well I better be informed! 'Cause this

                      ain't fallin' short! Now, any of y'all

                      got a collaborative agenda in the works?

                      I want to see it. These other agencies,

                      what time-lines they lookin' at? What

                      deadlines and why?

                                FITCH

                      Above your pay-grade--

                                BUD

                          (overlapping)

                      And is there a purposeful lack of

                      communication between competing agencies,

                      who are right now charting future

                      mistakes, as we fuckin' speak?!

                                FITCH

                      That's not your concern, Carter!

            Braddock suddenly arrives, steps into the room...

                                BUD

                      We're not talkin' about me!!

                                BRADDOCK

                      Bud!

                                BUD

                          (spins)

                      What?!

                                BRADDOCK

                      You're over-involved here.

            And Bud's taken off stride. Braddock looks Bud right in the

            eyes, so there's no doubt...

                                BRADDOCK

                      I'll handle this.

            Bud, red with anger, walks out. 

            Braddock watches him go. Fitch comes over, relieved...

                                FITCH

                      Thanks for coming down, Mike. He's been

                      berating my agents for the last hour.

            Braddock pours a cup of coffee.

                                FITCH

                      We're trying to band-aid a situation

                      here, and frankly, Carter's preference

                      for thug tactics isn't helping. It'll all

                      be in my report...

                                BRADDOCK

                          (interrupts)

                      "Isn't helping?"

            A big mistake. Now Braddock turns on Fitch, zeroing in...

                                BRADDOCK

                      "Isn't helping?" Let's not miss what

                      happened here, Fitch. We work for the

                      same cause doesn't mean we work for you.

                      What are you gonna do now? Send Jesse

                      back out? Earn his trust? Bud Carter

                      delivered the biggest informant in the

                      history of this state to your lap, and

                      you and the people you work for are gonna

                      let it go to shit.

                          (beat)

                      You can expect that will be in my report.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. STEEL MILL - PRE DAWN

            STEELWORKERS warped in heat waves swing ingots into troughs.

            The seven story furnace is deafening.

            ENTRY AREA

            Lucian is met by Kiersey. They walk together through glassed

            in hallways to a closed office door. 

            Lucian keys in, REVEALING a disheveled Morris seated in a

            chair with two large AB Soldiers on either side.

            INT. STEEL MILL OFFICE - PRE DAWN

            Lucian shuts the door and sits before an ill at ease Morris.

                                MORRIS

                      Look. I had no previous knowledge of any

                      business with Muslims. So if stealing me

                      here in the middle of the night, is some

                      kind of accusation--

                                LUCIAN

                      I'm not accusing you, Mr. Morris. But I

                      do find it interesting that right about

                      the time I employ you, my operation

                      starts having problems.

                                MORRIS

                      Yes, but--

                                LUCIAN

                      That is interesting...isn't it?

            Morris swallows hard as Lucian stares intensely.

                                LUCIAN

                      I want to know if this was an isolated

                      incident. If the ATF impeding on my work

                      is the result of a deeper threat.

                                MORRIS

                      What are you suggesting?

                                LUCIAN

                      I'm suggesting you contact your friends

                      in Washington.

                                MORRIS

                      With all due respect, Mr. Adams, that's

                      not what I was retained for.

                                LUCIAN

                      Well now it is.

                                MORRIS

                      That sort of information requires

                      clearance I don't have. If I start

                      sniffing around, people are going to ask

                      questions.

                                LUCIAN

                      I'm asking questions, Mr. Morris. And I'm

                      getting impatient.

            Morris gets stone quiet. Lucian hands him a phone.

                                LUCIAN

                      You don't leave here till I get answers.

            And like that, this conversation is over.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. LIQUOR STORE + PHONE BOOTH - DAWN

            Off a deserted street. A DENSE FOG resides, far as the eye

            can see. And Jesse, in a PHONE BOOTH, drops a dime and

            dials...

                                LYNN V.O.

                          (clearly asleep)

                      Hello...

                                JESSE

                      It's me.

                                LYNN V.O.

                      You okay?

                          (off Jesse's silence)

                      Honey, you alright?

                                JESSE

                      I'm okay. Just need to hear your voice.

                      How's little Ray...?

                                LYNN V.O.

                      I'll put him on.

            SILENCE for a moment...then a quiet baby's voice. 

                                LYNN V.O.

                      It's daddy on the phone, say hello.

            Emotion rises to Jesse's face. He holds it in, barely.

            ANGLE: DOWN THE STREET 

            a lone CAR is parked in the shadows, fog rolling past... 

            ...Jesse sees it, can't see who's inside it. 

                                LYNN V.O.

                      Jesse?

            He hangs up. 

            A LONG MOMENT... Jesse stands there, watching the car... He

            slowly makes his way toward the back of the store, where his

            truck is parked. Pulse pounding, he tries the door...it's

            locked. Eyeing the car, he unlocks his truck.   

            THERE'S SUDDEN MOVEMENT. Jesse spins. And out of the darkness

            -- steps Bud -- ready to pounce... 

                                BUD

                      Where the hell you been?

                          (Jesse's look)

                      Two days missin', you broke protocol.

                      Three, and you're a flight risk.

                      Agents'll hunt your ass down.

                                JESSE

                          (anger spiking, pacing)

                      I can't keep doin' this. I can't fuckin'

                      breathe. Even the shadows got eyes.    

                                BUD

                      This is the job. If I don't hear from

                      you, I can't protect you.   

                                JESSE

                          (in his face)

                      Protect me?! I about got my head fuckin'

                      shot off, 'cause your guys was

                      "protecting" me!

                                BUD

                      Those ain't my guys!

                                JESSE

                      I don't give a fuck-- I don't want your

                      protection! I want out!

                                BUD

                      There is no "out." Not for either of us.

                      Not till it's done...

                          (low, definitive)

                      Get me that list.

            Jesse STARES -- a malevolence in his eyes that freezes Bud to

            the spot. Then, Jesse climbs in his truck and drives off.

                                                                 CUT TO:

                      There's an investigation underway, funded

                      by the U.S. Attorney. And you're the

                      target.

            Morris opens his briefcase and hands over a pair of dossiers.

                                MORRIS

                      They're receiving assistance from both

                      the ATF and FBI, who are stationed right

                      here in Henderson.

                          (pause)

                      How long they been active?

                                MORRIS

                      My sources tell me three months.

            Lucian puts on his reading glasses, opens a dossier.

                                LUCIAN

                      Three months...

            Lucian peruses surveillance photos: Images of AB activity

            goes by in a blur. Lucian's eyes absorbing, rigid, unerring. 

                                KIERSEY

                          (reading)

                      This is U.S. Attorney John Nokes, at the

                      helm. He's been after us for years.

                                LUCIAN

                      Who they got for a mouthpiece?

                                MORRIS

                      A "mouthpiece"?

                                LUCIAN

                      Who's the rat in the woodpile? Who the

                      fuck's giving 'em information?

                                MORRIS

                      I couldn't dig that deep. But it's

                      someone close.

                          (pause)

                      I suggest you gentlemen disband.

                      Immediately.

                      Yeah.

                                KIERSEY

                      The investigation's local point is a

                      detective out of East Baton Rouge.

                          (beat)

                      His name's Bud Carter.

            ON LUCIAN. Thinking...Thinking...

            INT. JESSE'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

            Jesse, alone in the dark, seated on the couch... There's a

            SOUND outside... 

                                                                 CUT TO:

            Jesse moves soundlessly through the house, gun ready, toward

            the back door.

            JESSE'S POV: as the door opens slow, HE/WE SEE ON THE PORCH: 

            LUCIAN

            seated comfortably in a chair... 

                                LUCIAN

                      Couldn't sleep.

            Jesse looks to the darkness. Dogwood trees. Thick growth.

            EERIE SILENCE...

                                JESSE

                      Got somethin' on your mind? 

                                LUCIAN

                          (without looking at him)

                      There's been an adjustment to the list,

                      Jesse...

            Jesse's silent. YOU CAN CUT THE TENSION WITH A KNIFE...

                                LUCIAN

                      We got this...heathen. A whore of an

                      Irishman...down in Baton Rouge.

                      He's protected. Got a lot of guys around

                      him. That's why it pays. That's why

                      nobody wants the job... That's why we're

                      here talkin'.

                                JESSE

                      Who is it?

            Lucian sets a photo on the table, face down with an address

            written on back. 

            Jesse flips over the photo: It's Bud, in uniform. 

                                LUCIAN

                      This cop... he's got a mouthpiece...

                      somewhere. Ain't yet figured out who.

                      In the meantime, shut him down.

            ON JESSE, a frozen moment. He forces out the words:

                                JESSE

                      It's done.

            With that, Lucian gets up and leaves, disappearing into

            darkness.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. JESSE'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

            Jesse climbs into his truck and pulls out to the street... 

                                                                 CUT TO:

            JESSE'S TRUCK heading up the INTERSTATE, crossing into EAST

            BATON ROUGE, then driving through dark RESIDENTIAL STREETS of

            Bud's neighborhood...

            I/E. JESSE'S TRUCK - LATE NIGHT

            He pulls to the curb, parks. Jesse racks a MOSSBERG SG, loads

            it with solid shot, then lays the gun on his lap. 

            THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: Bud's house in the distance.

            And Jesse sits there, several moments...WAITS...BREATHES...

            Then he exits the truck...

            EXT. BUD'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

            Jesse moves -- fast, soundless -- toward the house. With his

            shotgun, scales the fence, as we--

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. DOWN THE STREET, BY JESSE'S TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

            A VAN arrives, stops. No headlights, two hundred yards from

            the house. INSIDE THE VAN: Catfish and Buzz. Several AB

            SOLDIERS in back, armed to the teeth.

                                BUZZ

                      That's his truck.

                                CATFISH

                          (nods)

                      Let's see what he does.

            The motor ticks and ticks and...

            EXT. SIDE YARD, BUD'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

            It's dark, quiet; but the muted glow of a tv in the living

            room. JESSE MOVES IN SHADOW, shotgun leading... He stops.

            LISTENS... 

            WE HEAR THE SOUND OF HARD WATER FROM A SINK OFF-SCREEN

            ...Jesse moves toward it...

            INT. CATFISH'S VAN - LATE NIGHT

            Catfish, Buzz, the soldiers watching Bud's house intently.

                                CATFISH

                      The fuck's takin' so long? 

                          (beat)

                      I would've shot that pig dead already...

                      'made a pulled-pork sandwich.

                                BUZZ

                      Give him a minute. That's a cop, lives

                      there. 

                                CATFISH

                          (checks his watch)

                      I'll give him two.

            Catfish, loading his gun, as--

            EXT. YARD, BUD'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

            Through a window, WE SEE Bud washing dishes. Then, slipping

            INTO FRAME...

            JESSE

            watching him. Pulse pounding, his mind on overdrive, trying

            to untangle identity and consequence... Then...

            He taps the window, and Bud looks up...

                                                                 CUT TO:

            THE BACK DOOR

            Bud opens it:

                                BUD

                      Jesse. 'The hell you doin' here?

                                JESSE

                      You been made, Bud. We gotta skin out.

                                                                BACK TO:

            INT. CATFISH'S VAN - LATE NIGHT

            Catfish, anxious now, racking his gun again and again.

                                CATFISH

                      Somethin's wrong... 

                                BUZZ

                      Relax, Catfish. You said two minutes.

                                CATFISH

                      Fuck you, man! This don't feel right.

                                BUZZ

                      Just give it a second. 

                          (to soldiers in back)

                      A few more seconds, right guys?

            Catfish, breathing hard, bent on bloodshed...

                                CATFISH

                      Let's kill 'em both. Let's do it now,

                      right now, let's go--

                                BUZZ

                      Catfish--

                                CATFISH

                          (erupts)

                      LET'S GO!!!

            INT. BUD'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - LATE NIGHT 

            Bud quickly dials the phone --

                                SHEPARD V.O.

                          (over phone, answers)

                      Yeah.

                                BUD

                          (into phone)

                      Hey. Meet me at the office in ten

                      minutes. Cobb and Marandino too.

                                SHEPARD V.O.

                          (over phone)

                      Why, what's up?

                                BUD

                          (into phone)

                      I'll explain later. Just get there. Now.

            QUICK CUTS as Bud hangs up, shoves a .38 in his waistband.

            Slams a clip and holsters a 9MM.

                                BUD

                          (to Jesse)

                      Let's hit it.

            Bud and Jesse start for the door...

            INT. CATFISH'S VAN - LATE NIGHT 

            AB Soldiers loading their guns. 

            CATFISH

            starts the engine; POV THRU THE WINDSHIELD: Jesse and Bud,

            leaving the house.

                                CATFISH

                      That's them! Together, you see?!

                                BUZZ

                      I see 'em--

                                CATFISH

                      You see?! They're fuckin' dead!

            EXT. BUD'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

            Jesse hurries down the lawn. Bud to his Chevy.

            SUDDENLY THE SOUND OF TIRES BURN... CATFISH'S VAN SEARS DOWN

            THE STREET...

            ...THE DOOR SLIDES OPEN AS AB SOLDIERS OPEN FIRE FROM SUB

            MACHINE GUNS. 

            Jesse drops behind a neighbor's sedan.

            Bud dives behind the Chevy. ROUNDS SLAM through sheet metal,

            interior, and out the other end. 

            AB Soldiers exit the van, spread and keep FIRING. Jesse's

            sedan takes hits. WINDOWS AND TIRES EXPLODE. 

            Bud and Jesse aim over their roofs. Take and RETURN FIRE. 

            Catfish emerges, kneels and pumps SHOTS into Bud's Chevy.

            The WINDSHIELD is BLOWN APART -- Shattered glass covers Bud.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. SHEPARD'S CAR, TRAVELING - LATE NIGHT 

            Shepard at the wheel. We hear dispatch on the police scanner:

                                DISPATCHER V.O.

                          (filter)

                      All units: 10-17 in progress. 1825

                      Hyacinth. Multiple shots fired--

                                SHEPARD

                      What the fuck?

                                DISPATCHER V.O.

                      --Units please respond...

            Shepard hits the BRAKES, peels a hard U-turn and SLAMS the

            gas toward Bud's house...

                                                                BACK TO:

            EXT. BUD'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

            Buzz rounds the van and OPENS FIRE.

            Jesse and Bud cover. Their eyes connect. Bud signals towards

            the house. Jesse nods...

            ...then lays cover fire with the Mossberg. AB #3 is spun and

            thrown. 

            Bud, under fire and firing back, races back into the house.

            Jesse keeps FIRING.

            I/E. BUD'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

            Bud YANKS an M-16 from the closet and slams the door.

            OUTSIDE

            Jesse, on his knees, pulls a secondary .45 from his waistband

            and fires over the hood of the sedan.

            CATFISH FIRES HIS SHOTGUN AND JESSE'S HAND EXPLODES IN HALF.

                                JESSE

                          (crumbles hard)

                      Fuck!

            Jesse hits the dirt, WRIST PUMPING BLOOD.

            AB #4 and #5 move in for the kill, when out of nowhere --

            SHEPARD'S CAR SPEEDS ON SCENE -- His door kicks out; SHEPARD

            PUMPS SHOTS, EXCHANGING.

            Buzz comes up from behind, aims -- BULLETS FLASH AND PUNCH

            THROUGH SHEPARD.

            INSIDE THE HOUSE 

            Bud swings the M-16 through the glass and BLASTS AWAY,

            killing AB #4, as Jesse staggers toward the house, holding

            his wrist...

            ...and DIVES inside, then kicks the door shut.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. BUD'S HOUSE - SAME

            Catfish, Buzz and AB Soldiers flank the house.

            INT. BUD'S HOUSE - SAME

            On the floor, Jesse rips out his belt, a tourniquet around

            the armpit. He holds it with his teeth and ties his arm.

            Bud reloads and slides Jesse a .357 Python. Jesse takes it up

            with his good hand.

            Suddenly in the darkness beyond, MUZZLE FLASHES DISCHARGE.

            THREE TRIPLE-AUGHT ROUNDS EXPLODE. Bud ducks, scrambles, as

            rounds splinter the wall. 

            A BACK KITCHEN DOOR is bashed open and AB #5 steps in,

            BLAZING SHOTS.

            Bud lets fly -- FIRING. Big bore rounds punch through AB #5.

            His insides hit the wall. 

            WE NOW HEAR DISTANT POLICE SIRENS APPROACHING...

            EXT. BUD'S HOUSE + STREET - SAME

            A LONG-HAIRED AB on the lawn fires dozens of shots from an  

            M-1.

            Catfish and Bud exchange CROSSFIRE as...

            ...Buzz starts up the van and Catfish jumps in, followed by

            Long-Hair...

            I/E. BUD'S HOUSE + STREET

            Bud runs out to the street, M-16 FIRING at the fleeing van.

            Bullets shatter the back window as the van speeds around the

            corner through garbage cans and a residential fence...

            ON BUD

            standing there. He turns, and STOPS when he SEES...

            SHEPARD

            inert, bullet-ridden.

                                BUD

                      Shepard!

                          (runs over)

                      No...

            Bud holds his partner, horrified. Around them, bodies on the

            lawn. Disabled vehicles. Doom overlays the property.

                                                                TIMECUT:

            EXT. BUD'S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

            Pandemonium as the street is clogged with POLICE VEHICLES and

            MEDIC UNITS. Braddock arrives with Cobb and Marandino.

            Bud moves alongside a PARAMEDIC wheeling a gurneyed Jesse,

            with a pressure bandage and splint, onto an ambulance.

                                BUD

                          (turns to Braddock)

                      We run 'em now, Mike. Right fuckin' now!

                                BRADDOCK

                          (nods)

                      What do you need?

                                                               SMASH TO:

            E/I. LUCIAN'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - PRE DAWN

            A huge BATTERING RAM knocks it right off the hinges. SWAT,

            Bud rush in with rifles...

            ...Room by room. Everyone clears. The house is empty.

                                SWAT #1

                      Nothing.

            E/I. STEEL MILL - PRE DAWN

            SWAT TEAMS have secured the premises. Two HELICOPTERS sweep

            the grounds via SPOTLIGHT. A manhunt for Lucian Adams.

            INSIDE, Cobb on his radio: 

                                COBB

                      No one here, Bud...

            INT. LUCIAN'S HOUSE - PRE DAWN

            Bud listens on his radios as SWAT OFFICERS file out of the

            vacant house.

                                COBB V.O.

                          (radio filter)

                      Empty. 

            Bud stands there, infuriated...

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. TRAUMA CENTER, OUR LADY OF THE LAKE HOSPITAL - DAWN

            Jesse, unconscious in bed, with IV lines re-infusing plasma.

            Bud is with a DOCTOR, who washes his hands in a sink...

                                DOCTOR

                      His bleeding's under control. There's

                      tissue damage. Projectile fragmentation

                      in the right forearm. We have most of it

                      removed. Two fingers are gone. A portion

                      of the palm. There's no chance of

                      reconstruction.

                          (Bud's silence)

                      I'll be monitoring his vitals.

            Doctor walks away. Bud turns as a NURSE dims the lights and

            pulls the curtains, obscuring Jesse...

            I/E. OUR LADY OF THE LAKE HOSPITAL - DAWN

            Bud, absorbed, walks past crowded emergency room activity...

            OUTSIDE

            Braddock is waiting. 

                                BRADDOCK

                          (stares for a moment)

                      You have to let go now.

            Bud says nothing.

                                BRADDOCK

                      It's over.

                                BUD

                      It's not.

                                BRADDOCK

                          (in his eyes)

                      The cover's blown. Lucian's gone. There

                      ain't nothin' left on this one.

            Bud, hearing it. Feeling every bit of it.

                                BRADDOCK

                      Get to a safe-house, Bud. 

                          (hands Bud a set of keys)

                      'Squad car over there is your's.

            Braddock walks off. Bud watches him go.

            INT. SQUAD CAR, TRAVELING - DAWN

            Bud drives in dark silence. As the hospital recedes, Bud

            pulls a flask from his coat, takes a drink...

                                                                  BLACK.

            FADE IN:

            Sunlight rises through a gap in the dark sky. 

            EXT. CEMETARY - MORNING - DAYS LATER

            SHEPARD'S FUNERAL. UNIFORMED POLICEMEN saluting as a PRIEST

            gives the eulogy. 

            BUD 

            at the gravesite, with Braddock, Cobb and Marandino. A salute

            is FIRED with rifles.

            LATER

            Bud stands alone. Dry-eyed, vacant stare.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. EAST BATON ROUGE STREETS - DAY

            Flashbulbs burst rapid-fire as coroner crews and police

            secure a crime scene: Richard Morris sits dead at the wheel

            of his car, a plastic bag over his head filled with blood.  

            IN THE FOREGROUND, lit by police lights, is Bud and Cobb.

                                COBB

                      ...His cranium was smashed with a lead

                      pipe. Then the plastic bag. He choked to

                      death while it filled up with blood.

                                BUD

                      Got I.D.?

                                COBB

                      'Name's Richard Morris. He's a top dog

                      lawyer-lobbyist out of Washington.

            Cobb proffers Morris' wallet. Bud sifts through cards --

            Several businesses, out of state -- Then stops cold at one:

            "Daniel J. Kiersey, Attorney at Law" 

                                BUD

                      Put a tap on that line.

                                COBB

                      Braddock ain't gonna like it.

                                BUD

                      Do it.

            Braddock arrives on scene. Disturbed expression:

                                BRADDOCK

                      Bud. I just got off with Nokes. 

                                BUD

                      And?

                                BRADDOCK

                      We got a problem.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. SUBACUTE CARE, REHABILITATION WARD - AFTERNOON

            A PARTITIONER bandages Jesse's swollen and stitched hand. Two

            fingers and thumb remain.

            There's a KNOCK O.S.

            Jesse looks up to see Bud enter from the hallway.

                                BUD

                      Give us a minute, Doc.

            Partitioner exits. Jesse, raw nerves raked. Looks to Bud. 

                                JESSE

                      Where you been?

            Lynn emerges from the grocery, looking sad and prematurely

            aged. Her baby in the cart, tucked between bags of food. 

            FBI #3 (TOM) helps Lynn and the baby into an Unmarked Car.

            INT. FBI UNMARKED CAR, TRAVELING

            Lynn sits in back with the baby. Tom, at the wheel.

                                TOM

                      Anything else while we're out, Mrs.

                      Wheeler?

                                LYNN

                      No thank you.

            THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: FLASHING CONSTRUCTION LIGHTS come

            into view. A DETOUR. And a team of LABORERS at work. 

                                                                BACK TO:

                      hell's goin' on?

            Bud stares intently, waits for his cue, can't find it...

            INT. FBI UNMARKED CAR - FLASHBACK

            LABORER #1 steps INTO FRAME with a STOP SIGN.

                                LABORER #1

                          (approaches Tom's window)

                      Wait here a moment, sir.

            A crane moves past, hoisting steel. Tom IDLES the engine.

            Then:

                                LABORER #1

                          (gestures)

                      Thanks for waiting. Go ahead.

            Tom drives onward, glancing in the REARVIEW: at Laborer #1

            watching them pull away, receding in the distance...

                                JESSE

                      family.

            Bud, the pit in his stomach widening, struggles to say:

                                BUD

                      There is no family.

            INT. FBI UNMARKED CAR - FLASHBACK 

            Tom - calm and alert - looks to his right - SEES a child's

            BICYCLE parked on the sidewalk. A BACKPACK affixed to the

            handlebars... 

            EXPLODES

            A MASSIVE GOEX BLAST IN TWO DIRECTIONS. HITS THE CAR'S REAR

            DOOR, CUTTING STEEL.  

            WINDSHIELDS OF PARKED CARS SHATTER. NEIGHBORHOOD HOMES. THE

            CAR IS BLOWN SIDEWAYS AND WRAPS AROUND A LIGHT POST. 

            THE CAR'S FRONT DOOR DROPS OPEN AND TOM CRAWLS OUT. CHARRED.

            BURNING. LAST GASP OF LIFE.

            EXT. ANOTHER RESIDENTIAL STREET - MOMENTS LATER

            A CARGO VAN pulls up and parks. The Labor Team abandons it,

            dumping gloves and outer clothing into plastic bags,

            REVEALING: A CREW OF AB SOLDIERS LEAD BY CATFISH. 

            The bags go in the back of a waiting SUBURBAN. Catfish takes

            the wheel. The crew climbs in, drives away. 

                                                                BACK TO:

            ON JESSE. Absorbing this. His face begins to tremble. Eyes

            press shut. They fill with moisture as he looks away.

            HOLD ON BUD. Quiet. Struggling to hide his own emotion. 

                                BUD

                      I'm sorry...

            And he walks out.

            INT. HALLWAY, REHABILITATION WARD

            MOVING WITH BUD, as he heads for the exit. Under harsh

            fluorescents...

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. SOUTHDOWN'S BAR - NIGHT

            Pouring rain.

            It's a madhouse outside. A crowd is gathered around a police

            action in progress. MEDICS are tending to the broken nose of

            a bartender (PETE) in his 30s. METRO COP #1 stands by. 

            A car pulls up and Cobb gets out with Marandino. They

            approach the bartender.

                                BARTENDER

                          (to Metro #1)

                      He's out of his mind. 'Asked him to slow

                      down; and he punched me in the face.

            Cobb and Marandino approach.

                                COBB

                          (to bartender)

                      Hey, Pete. You alright?

                                BARTENDER

                      I'm alright. The bar ain't. 

                                MARANDINO

                          (to Metro #1)

                      We'll smooth it out. Clear the street.

            Cobb and Marandino start toward the bar.

            INT. SOUTHDOWN'S BAR - NIGHT

            The place is A MESS. Chairs broken, tables overturned. Music

            BLARES on the jukebox. And empty except Bud... three sheets

            to the wind, drunk. Pacing the ruins with his 9MM in hand...

                                BUD

                      Y'all fuck with me? Huh? You want to fuck

                      with me?

            Cobb and Marandino peer in the doorway to see Bud, shouting

            and threatening a vacant chair.

                                COBB

                      Jesus Christ.

            Bud flips another table. Continues talking to the chair as if

            someone were in it. 

                                BUD

                      'Look at me when I talk to you.

                          (aims his 9MM)

                      You try and kill me? You like killin'

                      women and kids?

            Bud holsters his gun and beats the shit out of the chair.

                                COBB O.S.

                      Bud...

            Bud spins, glass-eyed and red-faced. His wavering vision can

            barely make out Cobb and Marandino approaching...

                                MARANDINO

                      Easy, Bud... Easy...

                      We got you here, Bud... It's just us.

                      Hear me?

            Bud stands his ground, tries to keep his balance...

                                COBB

                      Let's go home...

            There's a long moment. Bud stares at his crew, gone. Then

            he's suddenly overwhelmed with emotion...

            INT. REHABILITATION WARD - MORNING

            Two FBI AGENTS #4 and #5 walk together down this sterile

            corridor. They stop outside Jesse's closed door. A uniformed

            POLICE OFFICER is posted there, reading a newspaper.

            FBI #4 signs the chart. The two agents enter...

            INT. JESSE'S ROOM

            Jesse's bed is empty. The window open. Curtains billowing.

                                FBI #4

                      Check the bathroom.

            FBI #5 opens the bathroom door. Empty. Both Agents hurry to

            the window, SEE OUTSIDE: A large TREE six feet out from the

            ledge and a broken branch at street level. A seemingly

            impossible escape route.

                                FBI #4 (CONT'D)

                      Sonofabitch. This guy's crazy.

            INT. FBI WAREHOUSE - MORNING

            A badly hung-over Bud sits with Braddock, Fitch and numerous

            agents around a conference table. 

            NOKES

            walks the room, says to all:

                                NOKES

                      This is an atrocity, gentlemen.

                      Incompetence at it's highest level. I

                      gave you my name. My resources. My

                      trust...Carte blanche. And now this

                      handsome face of mine...can't step foot

                      in Washington, for fear of being laughed

                      off the Hill.

            Nokes circles behind Bud...

                                NOKES

                      Now, I'd love to point to Local on this.

                      But truth is, they've carried their

                      weight. We are federally fucked... 

                          (looks right at Fitch)

                      Because Federal fucked up.

            Fitch wipes sweat, swallows hard.

                                NOKES

                      So. Best idea wins, gentlemen. Chain of

                      command? Point of procedure? I don't give

                      a fuck. That's out the window, just like

                      our informant... 

                          (beat)

                      I want Jesse Wheeler found. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. HALLWAY, FEDERAL BUILDING

            As everyone files out. Braddock says low to Bud:

                                BRADDOCK

                      You smell like a fuckin' distillery, Bud.

                      Clean up... 'find your boy.

            ON BUD. Tired eyes. Everything else, and now this...

            INT. STORAGE GARAGE - DAY 

            A metal door rises up. Jesse, in silhouette, steps in.

            A BARE BULB comes to light. Mottled with fly excrement.

            Jesse unlocks and opens several SAMSONITE SUITCASES. Stacked

            in grey packing foam are rows and rows of GUNS.

            Jesse hefts his choices. Checking line and breach: A 12 Gauge

            Shotgun. A Colt .357 Magnum. A Remington sawed-off with

            pistol grip. Les Baer Tactical .45. Glock Semi-auto 9MM. Buck

            Knife. Duct tape. 5-Gallon gas cans. He loads up a gym bag.

            Jesse pulls scissors from a grooming kit and stands before a

            grimy mirror. He cuts off his hair. Then using clippers,

            shaves his scalp and mustache. 

            Jesse yanks a tarp off a '75 beat-up Chrysler. Pops the

            trunk. Throws in the gym bag. Then drives away. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. BAYOU GHOULA - NIGHT

            A lone, dilapidated HOUSE BOAT sits heavily in the bayou.

            Lights on inside. Dense FOG overlays.

            INT. HOUSE BOAT - NIGHT

            Long-Hair on the couch, watching tv, drinking liquor. SPEED

            METAL MUSIC blasts from a stereo somewhere.

            There's a METALLIC BANG O.S.

            Long-Hair looks up.

            The screen door rattles. Long-Hair grabs an aluminum bat,

            slowly approaching...

                                LONG-HAIR

                      Who's there?

            Sudden surprise as the screen SNAPS OFF and a SILHOUETTE

            breaks the glass, opens it.

                                LONG-HAIR

                      What the fuck?!

            Long-Hair RUSHES for the door as THE BUTT OF A 12-GAUGE SLAMS

            DOWN LIKE A TOMAHAWK.

            Long-Hair collapses with a shattered knee and muted scream.

            Jesse steps in, racking the gauge with one hand, takes aim on

            the helpless Long-Hair writhing on the floor.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. HOUSE BOAT - NIGHT

            The front lights go out. A terrible darkness.

            INT. HALLWAY, HOUSE BOAT - NIGHT

            A door flies open. Jesse, eyes darting, pushes Long-Hair in.

            Bandaged hand clamped to the collar. Shotgun at the neck.

            They move down a dark hallway. SPEED METAL throbs, growing

            LOUDER... Long-Hair, gash gushing, leg crunches with each

            step... They turn another hallway... Light spills from under

            a door, shadows behind it... Jesse edges Long-Hair forward,

            reaches the doorway, creeps through...

            INT. BEDROOM

            The door swings wide on the room, REVEALING: Buzz, on the

            bed, furiously fucking a dark-haired HOOKER, over a bureau.

            As Long-Hair rounds the corner... Buzz looks up, SEES Jesse.

            Dives for a gun. CHROME FLASHES. Everything EXPLODES at once.   

            The WALL DETONATES and Buzz goes down. Shocked. Choking.

            Blood juts from his side. He tries to get up. Can't.

            The HOOKER SCREAMS and cowers terrified in the corner.

            Jesse pumps, aims through the haze and fires again. Stereo

            explodes. MUSIC CUTS OUT, plunging us into silence.

            Jesse tosses clothes to the Hooker.

                                JESSE

                      Get out.

            The Hooker does.

            INT. BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

            Two chairs. Buzz and Long-Hair back to back. Hands and feet

            tied. Blood spigoting. Jesse circles them with the shotgun.

            The boat rocks gently.

                                JESSE

                      We got some shit to discuss.

            Buzz, to Jesse, unintimidated:

                                BUZZ

                      Ain't got nothin' to say to you, Wheeler.

                                LONG-HAIR

                          (top of his lungs)

                      I need a doctor! I need a fuckin' doctor!

            In one motion, Jesse racks the shotgun, thrusts the barrel to

            Long-Hair's chin AND BLOWS HIS HEAD OFF.

            Buzz screams, REARS UP, chair collapses beneath him, DRAGGING

            a dead Long-Hair along the floor, still tied together.

                                BUZZ

                      FUCK! FUCK! OH, FUCK!

                                JESSE

                      House call.

            Jesse YANKS Buzz up. His chair rocks upright, into place.

                                JESSE

                      Where's Lucian?!

                                BUZZ

                      I don't know!

            Jesse punctuates, shotgun butt against Buzz's head. Neck

            snaps. Teeth rattle.

                                BUZZ

                      NO ONE KNOWS WHERE LUCIAN IS! NO ONE

                      KNOWS-

            Jesse strikes again, connects. Buzz goes down in a heap, eyes

            swollen purple slits. His skull gushing red.

                                BUZZ

                      ...fuck...

            Jesse steps over Buzz, pins the shotgun to his jaw.

                                JESSE

                      Who killed my family?

                                BUZZ

                      Ah shit, man!

            Jesse shifts his aim an inch, pulls the trigger. SHOT REVERBS

            HARD. Buzz SCREAMS, hysteria. 

                                JESSE

                          (racks another shell)

                      WHO KILLED 'EM?! CATFISH?!

                                BUZZ

                      CATFISH, YES, YEAH! FUCKIN' CATFISH!

            Jesse puts down the shotgun. Pulls from his gym bag, two CANS

            OF GASOLINE, one of which, he splashes over Buzz's face.

                                BUZZ

                          (flinches)

                      The fuck is that?

                          (sniffs, realizes)

                      WAIT, WAIT! WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?!

            Jesse pours the rest over Buzz and the lifeless Long-Hair.

                                BUZZ

                          (thrashing)

                      NO! NO, NO, NO, DON'T!! DON'T!!

            As Buzz pleads for his life, Jesse unloads the shotgun, dead

            aim...FIRES.

            THE MUZZLE FLASH. GASOLINE IGNITES. BUZZ GOES UP IN FLAMES.

            Instantly, a FIRE ERUPTS. Buzz and Long-Hair's corpses BURN.

            Jesse empties the other can of gas, FEEDING THE FLAMES. THE

            FIRE SPREADS. BURNING THE WALLS. THE FLOOR AND CEILING.

            Jesse stands there, the heat reflects the intensity in his

            face. For a moment, it's a vision in hell.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. HOUSE BOAT, BAYOU GHOULA - PRE DAWN

            Engulfed in flames. SIRENS and LIGHTS as FIRE TRUCKS and FIRE

            BOATS douse the burning boat with hard water.

            Among a crowd of SPECTATORS, the shaken Hooker is being

            questioned by Marandino.

            Bud and Cobb stand apart. 

                                COBB

                      We've had a tap on Kiersey's line forty

                      eight hours now. It's clean. Whatever's

                      he's up to, Bud, it ain't comin' through

                      the front door.   

            Bud starts leaving the scene. Suddenly FITCH and two AGENTS

            barge forward.

                                FITCH

                      Carter! We need to talk. 

                                BUD

                      Get out of my way, Fitch.

                                FITCH

                          (following Bud)

                      This is my investigation. Jesse's cowboy

                      bullshit is not how it's done!

                                BUD

                      While your agents build their cases and

                      set for court, he'll erase the debt owed

                      to all of you. Overnight.

                                FITCH

                      So you're implying I should thank him?

            Bud shakes his head in disgust, keeps walking...

                                FITCH

                      Look, Carter, whether we like it or not,

                      you and I have to work together on this.

                      We entice Jesse back. I'll get him full

                      protection, if he agrees to testify. 

                                BUD

                      That'll never happen.

                                FITCH

                      Why the hell not?!

                                BUD

                          (turns)

                      'Cause it's over, Fitch. It's done. He

                      has nothing. Why do you think he lit that

                      fire? To plant a flag. To let us know he

                      doesn't need our protection. Doesn't want

                      it. He would've just left 'em for dead.

                                FITCH

                      For God sakes, listen to me! I'm not

                      taking the fall for this! The plan is--

                                BUD

                      No, the truth is, Fitch, you ain't got

                      balls big enough to relate to this guy.

                      If you had listened to me, we wouldn't be

                      in this situation. Jesse wouldn't be in

                      this situation. And you wouldn't be

                      askin' stupid fuckin' questions!

                          (walking away)

                      I'll bring him in myself. Just keep your

                      agents off my ass.

            Bud storms off.

                                                                  BLACK.

            FADE IN:

            EXT. WHISKEY BAY (BLEACH BYPASS) - DAWN - IMAGINATION

            Lynn stumbles through the woods, holding her baby. Scared.

            Lost. Their skin bleached-out. Eyes hollow. Like apparitions.

            We're in a dream. A sadistic enhancement.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

            JESSE'S EYES

            His family's image dissolves inside them.

            WIDEN to reveal Jesse before a cracked mirror in a SERVICE

            STATION BATHROOM. Perspiring, he re-bandages his hand as

            blood swirls down the drain. 

            INT. CORRIDOR, COURTHOUSE - MORNING

            An expensively dressed Kiersey emerges from a courtroom,

            flanked by a pair of well dressed AIDES.

                                KIERSEY

                      Get back to the office. Follow up on the

                      Arthur Bierce case. I need names and

                      numbers on my desk by three pm.

            The Aides scurry down another corridor, as Kiersey exits the

            building through the glass front doors...

            INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - MORNING

            Kiersey moves to a parked Cadillac pops the trunk and sets

            his briefcase inside, when...

            A RUSHING POV FROM BEHIND: Slams the trunk on Kiersey's hands.

            Kiersey SCREAMS, drops to his knees. His wrists wedged in the

            trunk. And standing over him...is Bud.

                                KIERSEY

                      OH, CHRIST! JESUS CHRIST! MY HANDS!

                                BUD

                      You know who I am?

                                KIERSEY

                      OPEN THE TRUNK! PLEASE! OPEN THE TRUNK!

            Bud kicks him in the stomach, doubles him over.

                                BUD

                      You know who the fuck I am?!

                                KIERSEY

                      YES!

                                BUD

                      Who's Richard Morris?! Why was he killed?

            No answer. Bud pounds on the trunk. Kiersey CRIES OUT.

                                BUD

                      I'll break every fuckin' bone you got.

                      Start talkin'.

                                KIERSEY

                          (hyperventilating)

                      I can't-- I can't--

            Bud slams both fists on the trunk. All his weight.

                                BUD

                          (off Kiersey's SCREAM)

                      Can't what?! What can't you do?!

            Bud, enraged, kicks Kiersey's ribs in. Again.

                                BUD

                      You piece of shit, talk!

                                KIERSEY

                          (hysterical)

                      He made Jesse...The investigation...

                      Everything...

                                BUD

                      His family?

                                KIERSEY

                      Everything! After that, he was just a

                      loose end!

            Bud opens the trunk. Kiersey crumbles to the ground, shaking.

                                BUD

                      Where's Lucian Adams?

                                KIERSEY

                      I don't know!

            Bud jams a foot in Kiersey's neck. Grabs his hands and bends.

            We HEAR bones snap.

                                BUD

                      Lucian's goin' down. You either go down

                      together, or you give him to me.

                                KIERSEY

                          (a mile a minute)

                      I never talk to him directly! I swear,

                      they page me-- 

            Bud roughly searches Kiersey.

                                KIERSEY

                      --Every night at five, for a six o'clock

                      call! They page from different numbers!

            Bud finds a PAGER on Kiersey's slacks, yanks it off. Then

            leans down with a smile, venomous:

                                BUD

                      You're a dead man, Kiersey.

            Bud storms off. Kiersey on the ground, a trembling mess.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. CATFISH'S HIDEOUT - DAY

            Catfish does a rail of meth off the counter.

            He lights a cigarette and sits down in a re-upholstered lazy

            boy where a TATTOO ARTIST is setting up... 

            Catfish proffers his forearm, displaying a row of notches

            (kills). And Tattoo Artist begins to outline two more...

                                TATTOO ARTIST

                      'Bout out of room, Catfish. You best

                      start collectin' scalps.

            Catfish smugs. Drags on his cigarette...

            WHEN A SUDDEN GUNSHOT SPRAYS CATFISH WITH BLOOD. Tattoo

            Artist drops dead on the floor.

                                CATFISH

                          (looks up)

                      What the fuck?!

            Jesse, standing over Catfish. A .45 comes down twice fast

            with a CRACK! Catfish is knocked cold.

            INT. BUD'S CAR - DAY

            Bud, on police radio, driving high-speed.

                                BUD

                      What do you got? 

                                                               INTERCUT:

            INT. METRO OFFICE - SAME

            Bud's VOICE over speaker phone. Marandino on the line with a

            sheaf of paperwork. Cobb enters.

                                MARANDINO

                      He's in the French Quarter. All numbers

                      paging Kiersey between five and six p.m.,

                      the last seventy-two hours, are pay

                      phones within a three mile radius.

                                BUD

                      Alright.

                                COBB

                      Bud, you gotta talk to Braddock. He's

                      lookin' for you, he's fuckin' pissed. 

                                BUD

                      Hold him off. I'll square it with him

                      when I get to the Quarter. 

            Bud punches the gas, traveling 90 mph.

            INT. CATFISH'S HIDEOUT - DAY

            CATFISH'S EYES blink awake - pinpoint dilated. WIDEN TO

            REVEAL he's stripped to his boxers, tied to the lazy-boy.

            And Jesse is seated beside him.

                                JESSE

                      I'm gonna ask questions... 

            Jesse rolls a tattoo tray of various HARDWARE towards him:

            Needles. Rusted pliers. An electric tattoo drill.

                                JESSE

                      When I'm satisfied with your answers, I'm

                      gonna kill you. How long it takes and how

                      much blood you want to spill...that's up

                      to you.

            Catfish grins. A wide, Amphetamine smile.

                                CATFISH

                      What do you want to know? Want to hear

                      about your brother? How we had him shot

                      up with strychnine? How he died slow

                      death?

            Without warning, Jesse grabs the PLIERS. A flash of movement,

            and there's a TERRIBLE SCREAM AS CATFISH'S FRONT TOOTH IS

            RIPPED OUT. He bucks violently in his chair.

            Jesse jams the DRILL into Catfish's gums, high speed. BLOOD

            SPRAYS. Loud, electric pain and Catfish CRIES OUT IN TERROR.

            Jesse sets down the drill, deadpan.

                                CATFISH

                      OH, YOU SONOFABITCH!!!

                                JESSE

                      Four days ago, my wife and son were

                      killed.

                          (pause)

                      I hear you took the contract?

            Catfish smiles. Lips quivering with hate.

                                CATFISH

                      Forty-four pounds, Miznay-Schardin. Like

                      you taught me. Fuck yeah, I took it. Blew

                      your bitch and kid sky high.

            Jesse grabs the pliers, YANKS another tooth. Catfish HOWLS.

                                CATFISH

                      MOTHERFUCKER!!!

            BLOOD SPEWS as the drill digs in. Catfish SCREAMS. Jesse

            tosses teeth on the tray.

                                CATFISH

                          (thrashing wildly)

                      OH, YOU'RE GONNA DIE! YOU'RE GONNA

                      FUCKIN' DIE!

            Jesse grabs Catfish's rapidly swelling jaw and yanks hard.

                                JESSE

                      Where's Lucian?

            Jesse TIGHTENS his grip. Vice-like. Blood fills Catfish's

            mouth. He gurgles, then SPITS in Jesse's face... 

            ...FLASHES OF STEEL and two more teeth rip out at the root.

            Catfish SCREAMS then passes out. Jesse slaps him awake.

                                JESSE

                      Where's he hidin' out?

            Catfish, last ounce of spite, cracks a blackened grin: 

                                CATFISH

                      Get fucked.

            THE DRILL STRIKES. Bone deep. Gum line splays open. Teeth

            crack and split. Catfish SCREAMS UNCONTROLLABLY. Blacks out.

            Jesse stops. A brief reprieve. He gets up and looks around

            the apartment. SEES: Magazines. A few revolvers. Empty liquor

            bottles. Meth on the counter. And on the stove:  

            A HYPODERMIC NEEDLE. Beside a pie tin, speed base boiling.  

            Jesse stares. He lowers the syringe into the tin, plunger up,

            drawing fluid...

            ...then very deliberately sticks Catfish's arm with the tip

            of the needle, pops a cc.  

            Catfish bolts awake, EYES WIDE. A long, wet WHEEZE.

                                JESSE

                      Where's Lucian?

            Catfish's head lulls. Jesse grabs him by the hair. Leans in.

                                JESSE

                      Where's Lucian?

                                CATFISH

                          (barely audible)

                      New Orleans...

                                JESSE

                      New Orleans. Where in New Orleans?

                                CATFISH

                      New Orleans...

            Jesse looks Catfish dead in the eyes. And death is there...

            Begging.

                                JESSE

                          (softly)

                      I believe you.

            With that, Jesse pushes the plunger down...ever...so...slowly.

            Blood burps and bubbles from Catfish's throat. Lungs convulse

            and spasm. Eye go wide then roll back. A suicide dose. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

            JESSE'S CAR racing up I-10, along the roaring Mississippi,

            toward a blood red horizon of a Louisiana sundown.

            EXT. FRENCH QUARTER, NEW ORLEANS - ESTABLISH - DUSK

            Cars line crowded streets in the heart of New Orleans. 

            I/E. BUD'S CAR - LOWER FRENCH QUARTER - DUSK

            TIGHT ON A DASHBOARD CLOCK: 5:04 p.m.

            Bud, waiting, parked outside a POLICE PRECINCT in the Lower

            French Quarter. Kiersey's pager on the dash. Waiting. Then:

            THE PAGER BUZZES.

            Bud grabs it, hurries out to a nearby pay-phone. Dials... 

                                BUD

                          (into phone)

                      It's Bud. I got a number. 

                                                               INTERCUT:

            INT. COMPUTER LAB, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRECINCT - DUSK

            Cobb on a database, phone cradled...

                                BUD V.O.

                      504-767-8092

                      Governor Nicholls Wharf. Between St. Ann

                      and Toulouse. You're a half mile south.

                                BUD

                      Get your ass down here.

            Bud slams down the phone. Jumps in his car. Hits the gas.

            EXT. GOVERNOR NICHOLLS WHARF - DUSK

            A busy promenade near the down river end of the Mississippi.

            Bud waits low in his car, parked in a distant lot. Through

            the windshield, WE SEE the subject of his surveillance...

            A PAY-PHONE

            on a crowded sidewalk. Faces pass. A Man in a JACKET arrives

            at the phone. He waits. Checks his watch...

            ...Bud checks his clock: 6:10

            The "Jacket" picks up the phone and dials...

            KIERSEY'S PAGER GOES OFF. 

                                BUD

                      Here we go.

            Jacket waits. No call. Walks away. Bud FOLLOWS on foot...

            EXT. FRENCH MARKET - DUSK

            A sprawling swirl of humanity, live jazz and bars. The Jacket

            passes through. Twenty feet back, Bud keeps pace...  

            ANOTHER PHONE BOOTH

            Jacket enters. Pumps coins into the PAY-PHONE. Dials... 

                                RECEPTIONIST V.O.

                          (recording)

                      You've reached the law offices of Daniel

                      J. Kiersey--

            Jacket hangs up. More coins. Another number...

                                KIERSEY'S VOICE V.O.

                          (recording)

                      Hello, you've reached the Kiersey

                      residence. No one's home right now--

            Jacket hangs up. Exits east onto BARRACKS STREET. Glances

            over his shoulder, then ahead, as Bud rounds the corner...

            EXT. DECATUR AVENUE

            Jacket crosses into a LIQUOR STORE. 

            Bud stalls at the corner, casing the street. Takes everything

            in. He reaches for his cigarettes, finds a crumpled back.

            Then crosses the street to...

            A NEWSSTAND

            outside the liquor store. Bud buys cigarettes and a newspaper.

            He opens the paper, glances at the headlines. At the same

            time, peers into the LIQUOR STORE WINDOW... 

            ...The Jacket walks toward the back of the store and out a

            door to an ALLEY.

            Bud heads south on Decatur. Lights a cigarette, as he passes

            various stores on the block. A private two-story building

            with blacked out windows at the far end: "TIBEDAUX'S TAVERN".

            Bud turns into... 

            EXT. A COBBLESTONE ALLEY

            Lined with boutiques on one side. Back of Tibedaux's on the

            other. A cargo gate is up and MEN are hoisting crates into a

            truck...  

            The Jacket is there, talking to them:

                                JACKET

                      Should've been on the road twenty minutes

                      ago. Hurry it up. 

            Bud pauses at a DRESS SHOP. Stares into the storefront glass,

            reflecting the Jacket and Men...   

            Jacket walks off. Bud flicks his cigarette, enters...

            INT. THE DRESS SHOP

            ...and peers out the window, watching the Jacket leave the

            alley and enter a FRENCH COLONIAL.

            INT. FRENCH COLONIAL, LOBBY - DUSK

            A SECURITY GUARD behind a desk. As Jacket walks in... 

                                SECURITY GUARD

                      What's goin' on, Jack?

            Jacket moves through a warren of CORRIDORS. Hardened MEN

            shuttle in and out of private offices. Plates on the doors:

            "Material Management." "Plating & Metal". "Demolition"...  

            Jacket knocks on a door. Opens it to...

            INT. PRIVATE OFFICE

            A bulked-out man at his desk... MILLS. Looks up as Jacket

            enters:

                                MILLS

                      Talk to me.

                                JACKET

                      Got nothin' to tell. Kiersey didn't call.  

                                MILLS

                      Try his office?

                      How long till you make an arrest in your

                      Why do you think? I'm afraid for my life.

                          (and the hammer)

                      I'll confirm whatever Jesse Wheeler's

            GUARD emerges with a rifle, posts.

                                BUD V.O.

                          (radio filter)

                      Talk to me.

                                MARANDINO

                          (into radio)

                      I've got a man on the south balcony.

                      Armed.

            The door below opens and a second GUARD steps out, posts.

                                MARANDINO

                          (into radio)

                      Second man at the door now. Street level.

                      Possibly armed.

            SUDDENLY HEADLIGHTS FLOOD MARANDINO'S REAR WINDSHIELD.

            Marandino ducks, a reflex action.

            EXT. DECATUR

            Lights from a CADILLAC and a GRAND MARQUIS appear and come

            down the street - past Cobb - SLOWLY. Blacked out windows...

            INT. COBB'S CAR

            POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD: as the cars turn into the alley...

                                MARANDINO

                          (into radio)

                      A Cadillac and a Grand Marquis, just

                      pulled in the alley.

            ...and stop behind Tibedaux's. 

            Passenger doors of both cars open, two AB SOLDIERS emerge.

            They open the rear door of the Cadillac and shadow the man

            they're escorting: LUCIAN.

            Balcony Guard looks on as Door Guard allows Lucian and his

            Soldiers to enter the building.

                                MARANDINO

                          (tense, into radio)

                      Bud... we got Lucian Adams...

            INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATE NIGHT

            Bud, pulse building to a boil.

                                BUD

                          (into radio)

                      Hold position. Give me a head count. 

                                MARANDINO V.O.

                          (filter)

                      Two men flanking. Drivers have not left

                      the cars. Initial perps still on post.

                      Lucian's entering the building...

            Bud pulls on a KEVLAR VEST, holsters a .45. Extra clips on

            the waistband. Checks a loaded PUMP SG.

            Ready.

            INT. VAN - LATE NIGHT

            Marandino, fastens on a vest, loads a 12-Gauge, locks.

            Suddenly, through the side window... A LONE FIGURE, IN A

            QUARTER TRENCH, MOVES PAST. It happens in a flash.

            Marandino LOOKS, SEES only a quick profile as the Figure cuts

            between parked cars and walks across the street... 

                                MARANDINO

                          (into radio)

                      I need eyes on a single, white male

                      crossing Esplanade. Possible intent...

            EXT. CAFE - LATE NIGHT

            Cobb looks over his shoulder, SEES the Figure 75 yards away,

            moving briskly across Esplanade...

            We still can't see his face.

            INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATE NIGHT 

            Bud grabs the rifle, eye on the scope, aims out the window. 

            POV THROUGH THE SCOPE: as the CROSS-HAIRS find the Figure

            walking. SEE the BODY. Then the FACE... IT'S JESSE. 

            ON BUD, spinning now.

                                BUD

                          (beat, into radio)

                      It's Jesse...

                                COBB V.O.

                          (quickly, radio filter)

                      He's heading toward the alley, Bud. We

                      take him down?

            BUD'S POV THROUGH THE SCOPE: THE CROSS-HAIRS FIXED ON JESSE'S

            HEAD - TRACKING - RACK FOCUS... This decision... He HAS to

            decide... And he does:

                                BUD

                      Let him go.

                                COBB V.O.

                      What?! 

                                BUD

                          (firm)

                      Let him go.

                                COBB V.O.

                      Bud, that's crazy! Jesse goes in first,

                      he's gonna blow this whole thing. We

                      can't let that happen. 

                                BUD

                          (intense, into radio)

                      That's exactly what we're gonna do! We

                      got no way inside. Let Jesse go in hard

                      and draw fire. He pushes Lucian out to

                      us. Stand the fuck down. I'm on my way.

            Bud throws down the rifle, grabs the pump SG, runs out the

            door...

            INT. VAN - LATE NIGHT

            Marandino, sweeps the alley with his binoculars. No Jesse.

                                MARANDINO

                          (into radio)

                      I don't see him. I got nothin'...

            POV THROUGH BINOCULARS: (PAN UP) to the balcony. MUZZLE

            FLASHES SUDDENLY IGNITE. Balcony Guard is shot dead. 

                                MARANDINO

                      Fuck! 

            JESSE STRIDES INTO VIEW. Draws a silenced Tactical .45 and

            FIRES, putting TWO HARD ROUNDS into Door Guard. Both DRIVERS

            get out. Jesse pivots, HAMMERS two rounds to their heads.

            They drop cold. It happens in seconds.

                                MARANDINO

                          (into radio)

                      Shots fired! Shots fired! 

            INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - LATE NIGHT

            Bud, charging through a FIRE EXIT, bounding down steps...

                                MARANDINO V.O.

                          (over radio)

                      Jesse hit four men! What do you want me

                      to do?!

                                BUD

                          (into radio)

                      Call it in! Local and SWAT! Get the place

                      surrounded!

            EXT. ALLEY + TIBEDAUX'S - LATE NIGHT

            Jesse slaps a clay plastique with a DETONATOR onto Tibedaux's

            back door, then covers.  

            There's a loud EXPLOSION as the DOOR BLOWS OPEN.

            INT. TIBEDAUX'S 

            FOLLOW JESSE through billowing smoke, into...

            A LONG HALLWAY

            as he pulls a REMINGTON SAWED-OFF, slung on a strap, to his

            left hand, .45 to his right.

            Mid-hall, AB #6 looks over, freezes.  

            JESSE'S SHOTGUN ROARS, REVERBERATING DOWN THE HALL, AND TWO

            HOLES ARE BLOWN INTO AB #6.

            INT. BACK ROOM

            Lucian with Kay and Bingham. They HEAR the explosion.

            Exchange looks.

            INT. HALLWAY

            Jesse steps over the dead AB #6 without breaking stride.

            Comes to a door. Kicks it in... 

            INT. PAYROLL OFFICE

            ...And Mills FIRES a gun, burning Jesse's ear -- Blood pours

            down his neck -- and Jesse's Tactical FIRES.

            Mills is HIT IN THE THROAT. He falls into a chair. And his

            eyes - at the fierce face of death - are filled with Jesse,

            who FIRES TWO ROUNDS. One to the head. That fast.   

            INT. BACK ROOM

            Two AB SOLDIERS #7 and #8 hurry in. Lucian, Kay and Bingham

            stand up. 

                                AB #7

                      Let's go. We're gettin' you out of here.

            All three bosses draw GUNS. Lock and load. 

            INT. CAFE - LATE NIGHT

            Outside, the sound of gunfire is heard. Jacket turns to the

            BARKEEP. Alarmed:

                                JACKET

                      Give me that fuckin' shotgun!

            Barkeep lays a shotgun on the bar. Jacket reaches. When...

                                COBB

                          (boaring in, 9MM aimed)

                      POLICE! TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF THE GUN! STEP

                      FUCKIN' BACK!!

            Jacket looks at Cobb. Steps back. Hands in the air.

            EXT. MOTEL + STREET - SAME

            Bud bursts outside, full throttle. Shouts into the radio:

                                BUD

                      Jam the alley! No one goes in or out!

            EXT. STREET + ALLEYS AROUND TIBEDAUX'S - SAME

            Marandino hits the gas. TIRES SCREECH as he slides sideways

            and secures the mouth of the alley. Door kicks out. 12-gauge

            levels.

            EXT. FRONT OF TIBEDAUX'S + DECATUR AVE

            Doorman #1, HEARING the commotion turns...

            ...SEES INSIDE THE CAFE, Cobb cuffing Jacket and Barkeep.

            Doorman #1 draws a Para-Ordnance .45, FIRES. A VOLLEY OF

            SHOTS SLAM INTO THE CAFE.  

            Cobb can't make it through INCOMING FIRE and covers.

            Remaining PATRONS SCREAM, drop under tables.  

            Doorman #1 KEEPS FIRING, advancing towards the Cafe, when--

            BOOM! A SHOTGUN BLAST takes his head off -- REVEALING BUD --

            behind him, running toward Tibedaux's.  

            I/E. TIBEDAUX'S, DOWNSTAIRS

            PATRONS stampede for the door. Lucian, Bingham and Kay with

            AB #7 and #8 follow...

            OUTSIDE TO THE STREET

            ...and Bud is coming right for them.

            CLOSE ON LUCIAN. The shock of seeing Bud. 

            Lucian FIRES.

            Bud kneels and PUMPS SHOTS - hits AB #7 and #8 - killing them.

            Lucian, Kay, Bingham flee back inside.

            INT. TIBEDAUX'S, MAINTENANCE ROOM

            Jesse yanks off the cover of the main electric panel. He rips

            out incoming lines and FIRES into the lighting circuit. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

            VARIOUS ROOMS INSIDE TIBEDAUX'S

            Fluorescent units explode, plunging us into DARKNESS. Arcs

            SPUTTER and FLARE, the corridors now strobe-lit. 

            EXT. TIBEDAUX'S - SAME

            Cobb runs out of the cafe, pushing through civilians. 

                                COBB

                      Down! Get down!

            Bud pursues Lucian...

                                BUD

                      Stay on the door! I'm goin' in!

            INT. TIBEDAUX'S

            Bud enters-

            Split-second and DOORMAN #2 OPENS FIRE from the waiter's

            entrance.

            Bud drops and FIRES BACK. Doorman #2 goes down. Bud runs

            across overturned tables and up a STAIRWELL...

            INT. DOWNSTAIRS, TIBEDAUX'S

            Jesse emerges. AB #9 steps out, FIRES. The bullet hits

            Jesse's vest, knocking him backwards.

            Jesse levels the sawed-off. FIRES. AB #9 falls in a heap.

            Jesse rises, keeps moving...

            INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAYS, ROOMS - TIBEDAUX'S

            MOVING WITH BUD entering, KICKING down doors, sweeping rooms

            with his shotgun... No sign of Lucian.

            INT. DOWNSTAIRS, BACK ROOMS

            Jesse is coming... 

            ...and the SLAUGHTER BUILDS. 

            He throws open a door to a BAR AREA.  

            AB #10 and #11 FIRE SMGs WILDLY, running from the room. Jesse

            UNLOADS the sawed-off. MISSING. Plaster throws and crumbles.

            A GUNSHOT rips through Jesse's left arm. The sawed-off drops

            to his side. Jesse turns - EDGAR BINGHAM is FIRING a SERVICE

            REVOLVER - SHOTS MISS as Jesse dives behind the bar.

            HAROLD KAY is moving down the stairwell. FIRING an Automatic

            wildly. Bottles and glasses explode.

            Bingham keeps firing. Mirrors SHATTER.

            BEHIND THE BAR

            bullets splinter wood, Jesse slams another magazine into the

            .45. Above him, strays catch lights, glass filaments EXPLODE. 

            INT. UPSTAIRS, HALLWAYS + ROOMS

            Bud KICKS down a door. AB #12 charges out. Grabs for Bud...

            who breaks the grab, pulls AB #12's neck down, slams his knee

            into his forehead twice, knocked cold. Grabs his gun.    

            A HALLWAY DOOR SWINGS OPEN

            AB #13 emerges, HAMMERING GUNSHOTS. Bud covers. SHOTS BLOW

            HOLES in the wall.

            A SECOND DOOR OPENS

            ...and AB #14 steps out, draws. Bud throws him in the way of

            CROSS-FIRE. AB #13 takes AB #14's SHOTS. 

            Bud aims past. FIRES ONCE.

            AB #14 is hit dead center and drops like an oak.

            Both men dead. That fast, and Bud is on the move... 

            EXT. ALLEY, TIBEDAUX'S - CONTINUOUS

            AB #10 and #11 run out and swing their SMGs, FIRING onto the

            alley and KILLING MARANDINO... Then charging to the front--

            COBB FIRES. AB #10 is BLOWN APART, as AB #11 FIRES back,

            hitting Cobb in the vest. His ribs broken, he sits down

            stunned.

                                COBB 

                          (into radio)

                      I'm hit. I'm fuckin' hit.

            AB #11 running past as several BLACK AND WHITES now arrive.

            TAKE AND RETURN FIRE -- AB #11 is shot dead.

            Police shouting. Civilians running, as...

            INT. BACK BAR AREA, DOWNSTAIRS

            GUNFIGHT ENSUES. 

            Jesse rises over the bar, FIRING BURSTS into Kay, who tumbles

            down the stairwell like a rag doll. 

            Bingham shoots Jesse in the hip. He staggers, then falls and

            rolls to his back... 

            Bingham rounds the bar just as Jesse, somehow, lifts the .45

            and FIRES two slugs into Bingham's chest.

            Bingham collapses on top of Jesse. The .45 hits the floor.

            Both men, bleeding profusely, thrash along the floor...

            INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

            Bud, racing toward a stairwell, LEAPS down a flight, turns,

            and RUNS down another. 

            INT. BACK BAR AREA

            Jesse, trapped under the heavy Bingham, pulls the buck knife

            from his holster and sinks it into Bingham's kidney. TWISTS.

            Blood POOLS. Bingham MOANS...

            ...Jesse rolls the big man over, hoists himself high and

            impales Bingham through the throat. Dead.

            Jesse exhales, struggles up...rising to his feet...

            BLAM! - A SUDDEN GUNSHOT

            out of nowhere. JESSE COLLAPSES, A BUNDLE OF TWITCHING

            NERVES, BLOOD POOLING FAST OUT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD...

            ...AND LUCIAN STANDS OVER HIM, HIS .357 SMOKING.

            Lucian turns slow. Toward a cracked MIRROR. Suddenly...

            IN THE REFLECTION: BUD EXPLODES DOWN THE STAIRS, AND SLAMS

            INTO LUCIAN WITH THE IMPACT OF A TRUCK. BOTH HIT THE FLOOR. 

            Lucian points his gun at Bud's head, who reaches for the

            trigger guard, shifts the barrel an inch -- A ROUND GOES OFF,

            BLOWING THROUGH BUD'S SHOULDER -- HE YELLS OUT, HOOKS HIS

            FINGER IN THE TRIGGER, STOPPING THE NEXT SHOT.

            Bud flips Lucian over, rips the gun away. Lucian tries to

            break free. Bud grabs him - smashes the gun over and over

            against Lucian's face.

            Lucian's head BOUNCES. Eyes roll, then right.

            Lucian quarter rolls, then CRACKS a forearm into Bud's head.

            Again, and Bud is knocked back with a gash over his eye. 

            Lucian REARS BACK and KICKS HARD into Bud's sternum.

            Lucian scrambles. Bud tackles him into a table, which goes

            down. A chair breaks. Bud lands a thunderous hook and

            Lucian's nose shatters. Another and his cheekbone caves.

            Lucian drops like a rock. Tries to crawl under another table.

            IN A MANIACAL RAGE, Bud flips the table and stomps down on

            Lucian with furious blows that come one after another.

            Lucian tries to cover up. BUD IS ALL OVER HIM. Grabs Lucian

            by the throat and presses down.

            Lucian, fighting to breathe, digs his nails into Bud's face,

            tearing skin. 

            Bud's face twists with hate as he chokes the life out of him.

            Lucian's eyes BULGE...His mouth stretches WIDE...clutching at

            Bud's fingers, trying to pull away...

            Bud SNORTS, tightens his grip... bearing down... And at the

            last moment, the cop in him reemerges...

            Bud lets go.

            Lucian rolls to his side and coughs up a thick ribbon of

            blood and vomit. Bud slams on restraints.

            Bud staggers to his feet...breathing hard...Spots Jesse on

            the floor...And he slows...

            Jesse lies in shadow. Perfectly still. We cannot see his face.

            Only the dark pool of blood around him.

            Lucian passes out.

                                BUD

                          (into radio)

                      I got him... I got Lucian.

            SLOWLY PULL AWAY AND TRACK OVER THE MASSACRE...

            ...as POLICE come in...over bodies and blood and guns, and up

            the stairs and out a broken window, to the CROWDS in the

            street held back by POLICE, past flashing lights and

            emergency vehicles... 

            ...to where life goes on in New Orleans.

                                                           DIP TO BLACK.

            FADE IN:

            EXT. EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRECINCT - DAYS LATER

            The sun is out. The sky above is clear.

            INT. EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRECINCT - DAY

            ON BUD, as he leads Lucian through the bowels of city lock-up. 

            Lucian - in prison garbs, haggard, dark bruises - looks up as

            they pass a two-way mirror of an INTERROGATION ROOM, SEES...

            KIERSEY

            ...seated, making statements to Shepard, who is taking notes.

            Stacks of Jesse's reports surround them.

            Bud walks Lucian past, into...

            INT. INTERROGATION ROOM #2

            ...and Lucian sits at a table. Bud across from him. Silence

            hangs, several moments. 

            ON BUD                                                             

            starting again, knowing... There's something bigger. A slow

            smile spreads...

                                BUD

                      Want a cup of coffee?

                                                         THE END
