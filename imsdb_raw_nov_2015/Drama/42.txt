           bottom. Pluming off into dust. White, white, white. We 

           move toward it even as it recedes, always out of reach. 

           Finally we pop out wide and high to reveal... 

           The white is chalk. An old BLACK GROUNDSKEEPER lays down the 

           right field line on a baseball diamond.

          Blinds closed. Dust motes in the air. A large GOLDFISH TANK

          bubbles. BRANCH RICKEY at his desk. Two photos on the wall:

          Abe Lincoln & Leo Durocher. CHALKBOARDS covered with 100's

          OF NAMES, every player in the Dodger organization.

          CLYDE SUKEFORTH and HAROLD PARROTT sit across from Rickey

          who stares at them. Sukeforth stares back. Parrott nervous.

                         RICKEY

          Gentlemen, I have a plan... As of

          now, only the Board of Directors

          and my family know.

          Sukeforth and Parrott exchange a look.

                         SUKEFORTH

          A plan's always good, Mr. Rickey.

          And you always got one.

                         RICKEY

          My wife says I'm too old, That my

          health isn't up to it. My son says

          that every one in baseball will be

          against me. But I'm going to do it.

          Parrott looks to Sukeforth who keeps his eyes on Rickey.

                         SUKEFORTH

          Do what, Mr. Rickey?

                         RICKEY

          I'm going to bring a Negro

          ballplayer to the Brooklyn Dodgers.

                         PARROTT

          With all due respect, sir, have you

          lost your mind? Imagine the abuse

          you'll take from the newspapers

          alone. Never mind how it'll play

          on Flatbush. Please, Mr. Rickey.

          Rickey looks dismissively at Parrott, over to Sukeforth.

          There's no law against it, Clyde.

                         SUKEFORTH

          There's a code. Break a law and

          get away with it, some people think

          you're smart. Break an unwritten

          law though, you'll be an outcast.

          So be it. New York is full of

          Negro baseball fans; every dollar

          is green. I don't know who he is,

          or where he is, but he's coming.

          The big Birmingham Black Barons CATCHER behind the plate as

          Kansas City Monarchs JOHN SCOTT stands at bat. The catcher's

          attention on the RUNNER DANCING off first. Stomping a foot,

          feinting, hard to see clearly in the glare of the lights.

                         CATCHER

          Where'd you learn to move like

          that, runner?! At dime a dance

          night?! Stay quiet!

          INSERT: Birmingham, Alabama. April 8, 1945. 

          On the first pitch the runner takes off. The catcher fires to

          second. See it from his POV as the runner slides in aSAFE!a

          A foot on the bag, the runner dusts off, heckles the catcher:

                         RUNNER

          Is that the best you got?! Huh?!

          I'm going to steal nine, ten bases

          today! You better start counting!

          The catcher frowns. Standing, we see he is a big, big man.

                         CATCHER

                         (ALABAMAN)

                         CATCHER

          He's got a mouth on him.

          Shaking his head, the catcher gets back in his crouch,

          signals the PITCHER. On the wind-up, the Runner is off

          again. The catcher fires to THIRD: aSafe!a

                         RUNNER

          You got a rag arm, catcher!

                         CATCHER

          Steal home! You'll find out what

          kind of arm I got!

          DBL. BLUE REV 7-9-12 3.

                         RUNNER

          Okay, I'm coming!

          The Catcher looks over at Scott who chuckles.

                         CATCHER

          California, huh?

                         (SCOTT NODS)

          Well California here he goes, if he

          comes down here.

          The Catcher gets back down in his squat. Signals the

          pitcher: fastball. Scott digs in, ready. The runner dancing

          off third. Here comes the wind-up...

          The Runner takes off even as the pitcher fires it in. The

          Birmingham Catcher receives it. As the Runner slides --

          The Catcher intentionally drives his glove, the ball and both

          hands into the runner's face -- WHALLOP! Sound drops as

          we're knocked flat senseless along with the runner.

          ON HIM now as he tries to push himself up from the dirt. A

          close look at JACK ROOSEVELT ROBINSON. A born battler, he

          shakes out the cobwebs, finally lurches to his feet, looks to

          the UMPIRE. He never heard the call.

                         JACK

          What was I?

          The umpire passes one hand over the other: Safe. Jack looks

          over at the catcher, gives him a pointed look as he goes --

          The catcher shoves him in the back. Jack turns, shoves back.

          As the two men wrestles each other to the ground --

           Rickey reviews one, Sukeforth tries to hand him another.

          Sukeforth holds it out; Rickey won't take it. 

                         RICKEY

          A heck of a player. But too sweet,

          they'll eat him alive.

          As Parrott sets them on the desk, they start to slide off, 

          spilling to the floor. Helpless to stem the tide, Parrott

          looks down, surrounded by black faces...

          (flips through file)

          A four sport college man, out of

          UCLA. That means he's played with

          white boys.

          Twenty-six years old, now with the

          Kansas City Monarchs. Batting over

          350 even as we speak. 350! And he 

          was a commissioned army officer!

                         SUKEFORTH

          He was court-martialed. A trouble

          maker. He argues with umpires. A

          quick temper is his reputation.

          Rickey is obviously keen on him. 

                         PARROT 

          What was he court-martialed for? 

                         RICKEY 

          For refusing to sit in the back of 

          a military bus. 

          (checks the file) 

          Ft. Hood, Texas. The driver asked 

          him to move back. The MPs had to 

          take him off.

          Do you see? 

                         RICKEY

          I see he resents segregation. If 

          he were white, we'd call it spirit! 

                         PARROT 

          If he were white, sir, we wouldn't 

          be looking for him.

          Rickey ends the debate...

          Robinson's a Methodist. I'm a

          A BLOODHOUND watches as a BUS pulls into a SERVICE STATION,

          the tires RING the bell hose. A million miles easy on this

          road rumbler. The BANNER reads: KC Monarchs.

          Insert: Interstate 24, Missouri - August 24, 1945.

          The DRIVER steps off. The fellas follow, getting off to

          stretch their legs. Hot and tired. A WHITE ATTENDANT

          saunters out. The driver steps over to meet him.

                         ATTENDANT

          Fill her up?

                         DRIVER

          Yes, sir.

          The attendant starts unscrewing caps on two 50-GALLON TANKS.

          Where you all headed?

                         DRIVER

          As the attendant shoves down a pump, starts filling, Jack

          steps off. He spots and heads for a restroom. White Men

          Only lettered on the door. The attendant roused as he sees.

          I'm going to the toilet.

                         ATTENDANT

          Shit, boy, c'mon. You know you

          can't go in there.

          Jack does a slow burn, then suddenly strides toward the

          attendant. The air rife with tension.

                         JACK

          Take that hose out of the tank.

                         ATTENDANT

          Take it out. We'll get our ninety-

          nine gallons of gas someplace else.

          The attendant blinks. He takes a look from Jack to up and

          down the deserted highway. No business in sight.

                         ATTENDANT

          Okay, use it. But don't stay in

          there too long.

          I think so.

          You think so?

          I don't make much money. Between

          the army and now baseball I've been

          away a lot. And Rae, Rachel, she

          wants to finish school. Considering

          all that, I say I think so.

          Don't you know?

                         JACK

          Yes, sir, very much.

                         RICKEY

          Marry her.

          What? Rickey stands, walks to a window. Jack looks at

          Sukeforth who raises a hand as if to say: Give it a chance.

          RICKEY (CONT'D)

          Baseball's a hard life; a man needs

          a good woman by his side. You

          don't want the only person waiting

          for you at home to be a catcher.

          Sukeforth chuckles at that. Rickey fingers open a slat on

          the blind and peers out. Jack looks hard at him.

                         JACK

          Coach Sukeforth here said you were

          starting a new Negro League. That

          doesn't make sense to me.

          MR. RICKEY

          It doesn't, huh? Are you calling

          us liars, Jack?

                         JACK

          What's this about, Mr. Rickey?

                         RICKEY

          This is about baseball.

          Rickey opens the shade. Sunlight floods in. Rickey follows

          it to the chalkboard, to the list of players under Montreal.

          RICKEY (CONT'D)

          I see you starting in the spring

          with our affiliate in Montreal. If

          you make it there, we'll try you

          I'll pay you $600 a month and a

          $3,500 bonus when you sign the

          contract. Is that agreeable?

          Believe it or not that's a lot of money to Jack on this day

          in time. This is all becoming a bit overwhelming.

                         JACK

          Yes, sir. That's fine.

                         RICKEY

          There is one condition. I have a

          pile of scouting reports. I know

          you can hit behind the runner, that

          you can read a pitch. The question

          is can you control your temper?

                         JACK

          My temper?

                         RICKEY

          Yes your temper! Are you deaf?! 

          Rickey furious, the avuncular old man gone. Jack sits there, 

          fists now balled. Rickey to Sukeforth like he's not there: 

          RICKEY (CONT'D)

          He looks proud. Willful. 

                         SUKEFORTH

          He'll need to be.

          Rickey looks back to Jack who is as angry as he is confused.

                         RICKEY

          I want to win! I want ballplayers

          who can win! Are you one of them?!

          Yes.

          A black man in white baseball.

          Imagine the reaction. The vitriol.

          Rickey strides forward, gets in his face.

          The Dodgers check into a hotel. A

          decent good hotel. You're worn out

          Answer me, you black sonofabitch!

                         JACK

                         (MASTERS HIMSELF)

          Do you want a ballplayer who

          doesn't have the guts to fight

          back? Is that what you want?

                         RICKEY

          I want one who has the guts not to

          fight back! There are people who

          will not like this. They will do

          anything to get you to react. If

          you echo a curse with a curse, they

          will only hear yours. Follow a

          blow with a blow and they will say

          a Negro lost his temper; that the

          Negro does not belong. Your enemy

          will be out in force, but you can

          not meet him on his own low ground.

          We win with hitting, running and

          fielding, nothing else. We win if

          the world is convinced of two

          things: that you are a fine

          gentlemen and a great ballplayer.

          Like our Savior, you must have the

          guts to turn the other cheek.

          Jack considers Rickey. Rickey looks worn out.

          RICKEY (CONT'D)

          Can you do it?

          Jack poised at what will be his Rubicon. He crosses.

                         JACK

          Mr. Rickey, you give me a uniform,

          you give me a number on my back,

          Who's the best shortstop you ever

          saw?

                         SMITH

          Rabbit Tavener.

                         RICKEY

          Rabbit Tavener? And you call

          yourself a sports writer?

                         SMITH

          Yes, a sentimental one. I'm from

          Detroit. He was the Tiger

          shortstop when I was a boy. How

          about you? Who's your best?

                         RICKEY

          Pop Lloyd.

          Not Honus Wagner?

                         RICKEY

          Wagner is number two. And Rabbit

          Tavener would not break my top 25.

          Where do you suppose Jackie

          Robinson will end up on that list?

                         SMITH

          He won't break it. He doesn't have

          a shortstop's arm. Robinson

          belongs on second base.

                         RICKEY

          Alright then, where would he rate

          at second?

                         SMITH

          best second baseman in the majors.

                         RICKEY

          High praise. He'll have to be the

          best in the minor leagues first.

          You're aware in the past six months

          I have a business proposition.

          What's your salary at the Courier?

                         SMITH

          Fifty dollars a week.

                         RICKEY

          I will pay you an additional fifty

          dollars a week plus expenses if you

          will attend spring training with

          Jackie Robinson. You will watch

          harm that could come if he were to

          do or say anything out of turn.

          You will act as his chauffeur, you

          will secure accommodations for him

          wherever the team may be, help him

          find restaurants, etc...

                         SMITH

          What do you say, Mr. Smith?

                         SMITH

          I say yes, sir. If a Negro is good

          enough to stop a Nazi bullet in

          France; he's good enough to stop a

          line drive at Yankee Stadium.

           Look, Jack, right now it's just me 

           asking you. But you get on that 

           field and it's going to be the New 

           York Times and the Sporting News. 

           You should think about it. 

                          JACK 

           If they ask something, I'll answer. 

                          SMITH 

           Alright, but you know when you're 

           at the plate, you want to feel like 

           you see the pitch come in slow? 

           Well, you want to see the questions 

           come in slow, too. 

           Jack just looks at him. Gets out. Smith sighs.

          As PLAYERS (Brooklyn, St. Paul & Montreal) warm up, practice,

          Rickey sits on the bench, angry as he reads a NEWSPAPER.

          Harold Parrott hurries over, something urgent on his mind.

          Rickey on a rant; Parrott can't get a word in.

                         RICKEY

          Listen to this, Harold. Whenever I

          hear a white man - yours truly -

          broadcasting what a Moses he is to

          the Negro race, then I know the

          latter needs a bodyguard.

          (Parrott tries to

                         INTERJECT)

          It is those of the carpetbagger

          stripe of the white race - me again

          - who under the guise of helping,

          in truth are using the Negro for

          their own selfish interest, thereby

          retarding the race!

          Parrott tries to interrupt again, but Rickey is furious.

                         RICKEY

          The minor league commissioner of

          baseball said that! I pay part of

          his salary! You wouldn't stab me

          in the back like this, would you?

          He's fine with me, so long as you

          keep him up in Montreal.

          We ain't doing much today. Just

          Higbe and Bragan call out from the door of the Dodger bus.

          He thought the last two words of

          the National Anthem were Play Ball!

          Jack forces a smile, but the joke comes off a bit harsh. And

          they seem like they're laughing at him as...

                         HIGBE

          How about the shortstop making all

          the errors, tried to kill himself

          by jumping out on the highway?

                         BRAGAN

          A bus just missed him. Drove right

          between his legs!

          As the bus passes by, Jack sees the impassive faces of Dixie

          Walker, Reiser, Stanky, Pee Wee Reese and finally 20-year-old

          Branca. Branca smiles, offers an awkward little wave.

                         SMITH

           must've read a joke book. If he 

          can read.

          I'm just a ballplayer, Mr. Brock.

          Tell that to all the little colored

          boys playing baseball in Florida

          today. You're a hero to them.

          The look on Jack's face says that's a heavy burden.

          Sit down, have something to drink.

          Second base is his spot.

          I agree. And I'll state another

          obvious, Clay, I need the players

          pitch as a LOW LINE DRIVE shoots for the gap between 1st and

          2nd. Robinson turns himself inside out to dive on his belly

          and catch it before it hits the ground.

          He spins himself around, pivots on a knee to throw the runner

          out before he can get back to first. A  Rickey is astounded.

                         RICKEY

          That was superhuman.

          Superhuman? Don't get carried

          away, Mr. Rickey, that's still a

          Nigger out there.

          Rickey takes a moment to process. It's Hopper's light

          admonishing tone that really halts him. Finally...

                         RICKEY

          Clay, I realize that attitude is

          you can manage Robinson fairly and

          correctly or you can be unemployed.

          leave, that you would fight.

          As it becomes clear, Jack starts to LAUGH.

                         SMITH

          What the hell are you laughing at?

                         JACK

          I thought you woke me because I was

          cut from the team.

          Jack LAUGHS harder. Wendell LAUGHS as well. As it fades,

          Jack looks back over his shoulder. Jesus...

          44 EXT. CITY ISLAND BALLPARK - DAYTONA BEACH - DAY 44

          A stadium SIGN boasts Brooklyn Dodgers vs. Montreal Royals.

          PINK REV 4-19-12 35.

          Daytona Beach's black community is turning out to see Jackie

          Robinson. Hundreds of people line up, mass at the: Colored

          Entrance. In their Sunday best. Families. Couples. The

          old. The frail. Young boys chase after each other. One

          MOTHER stands on her toes to spot her son.

                         MOTHER

          Ed! You stay where I can see you!

          13-year old ED CHARLES turns, waves his baseball glove over

          his head so she can see him. Then to no one in particular:

                         ED

          I'm thirteen years old.

           WHITE PEOPLE enter at several gates around them.

                          CUT TO:

          45 CLOSE ON BRANCH RICKEY - THE DODGER DUGOUT 45

          He sits watching as the segregated bleachers in right fill

          with BLACK FANS. All else is white. Rickey pops a PEANUT in

          his mouth, confides to someone alongside him we don't see.

                         RICKEY

          I've spoken to the mayor. I've

          explained how much money we'll

          spend in Daytona. But still, when

          this fine young Negro man steps on

          that field today, he and the

          Dodgers will technically be

          breaking the law. A law which says

          white and black players cannot

          enjoy the same field at the same

          time. Does that make sense to you?

          Does Jim Crow make any sense when

          placed against the words of the

          United States Constitution? When

          placed against the word of God?

          POP OUT to reveal he sits beside the DODGER BATBOY, so short

          his feet don't touch the ground. Rickey offers his peanut

          bag. As the batboy takes one...

                         RICKEY

          I'll tell you, it does not make

          sense to me.

          Jack swinging two bats to get loose. Watches as the Montreal

          BATTER hits a LINE DRIVE which -- Pee Wee Reese nearly leaps

          out of his socks to bring down. Wow...

          As the CROWD claps in appreciation, Jack takes a deep breath.

                         PA ANNOUNCER

          Now batting the second baseman --

          Jackie Robinson!

          Jack wincing as he steps forward to both cheers and boos from

          the white sections. As a a go home, coon' drifts over -- A

          BIG OVATION from the black section in right drowns it out.

          COLORED SECTION - RIGHT FIELD 

          Rachel sits with Smith. They react to some of the INVECTIVE 

          coming from the white section. 

                         RACHEL 

          Jack's got a thick skin. He'll be 

          okay. 

                         SMITH 

          How about you?

                         INFIELD 

          Higbe watching from the mound as Jack steps into the batter's

          box. Two well wishing voices from the infield stands.

                         SPECTATOR ONE

          Come on, black boy, you can make

          the grade!

                         SPECTATOR TWO

          They're giving you a chance! Do

          something about it!

          Jack heartened at the words. Concentrates as Higbe's first

          pitch is fired. High and tight, Jack jerks out of the way.

          YELLOW REV 4-24-12 37.

          Bragan, behind the plate, chucks the ball back, grins up at

          Jack who does not look down at him as he settles back in.

                         ED CHARLES

          The 13-year-old holding his hands together in prayer.

                         ED

          Please, God, let Jackie show them

          what we can do.

                         HOME PLATE

          Here comes the next pitch. Even tighter. Jack nearly hit.

                         UMPIRE

          Ball two!

          Jack glaring, crowds the plate more. Bragan shows 1, taps

          his right thigh signalling outside. Jack watches it sail,

          doesn't bite. The umpire: aBall Three!a Higbe's fun

          slipping away as he can't find the strike zone.

                         HIGBE

          Come on, Rook! Ain't you gonna

          swing at something?!

          Jack takes a practice swing, waits as Bragan sets up right

          over the plate. Here comes the pitch. Low. aBall four!a

                         RACHEL & SMITH

          A big, over-reacting CHEER from the Colored section.

                         SMITH

          It's just a walk.

                         RACHEL

          Who can blame them?

                         HIGBE

          Looks ill-tempered over to first where Jack gives the same

          look back as he sidesteps an enormous, defiant lead off the

          bag. Higbe incredulous. Did he just do that?

                         DUROCHER

                         (FROM DUGOUT)

          Well throw over there for crying

          out loud!

          Higbe fires to LAVAGETTO at first. Jack dives back in time.

          YELLOW REV 4-24-12 38.

          Higbe gets the ball back, settles. Jack takes a lead, but a 

          modest one this time. Here come the pitch -- And Jack goes.

          You knew he was fast; but not this fast. Bragan's throw to 

          Pee Wee is late and high. Pee Wee throws back to Higbe. 

          Higbe sets. Bragan gives him a sign. Jack takes a lead. On 

          the wind-up, Jack goes. Bragan stands -- it's a PITCH OUT. 

          Bragan fires to third and Jack is caught in a RUN DOWN. It 

          seems like half the team gets involved with Higbe finally 

          getting the ball by third and Jack ducking under the tag. 

          Safe! A BUZZ goes through the stadium now as people start to 

          realize they are not watching something or someone ordinary.

                         RICKEY

          Watching from a seat behind third.

                         RICKEY

          Thataway, Jackie! Thataway!

                         HIGBE & JACK

          Higbe looks home for the sign, Jack dancing off third, 

          pounding his right foot toward home. He feints hard home. 

          Higbe steps off the rubber. Jack stays where he is. 

                         HIGBE

          Hell! You're supposed to go back

          to third when I step off! Don't

          you know nothing?!

          He throws over. Jack back to the bag. Higbe gets the ball

          back, looks in. Jack bouncing, pounding off third. His 

          movements carry violence within them. Like a piston 

          exploding in an engine. 

          Higbe into his motion, stops his delivery, accidentally drops 

          the ball to the ground. The umpire signals BALK, points Jack

          home. Higbe is furious.

          ED CHARLES - IN THE COLORED SECTION

          CHEERING, joyous. His mother joins in, happy despite...

                         MOTHER

          I don't understand. What happened?

                         ED

          It's a balk, Mama. The pitcher

          can't start toward home and then

          stop. Jackie scores.

          Oh, mama, yes he did, he

          discombobulated the man.

          Durocher looks to Branca, impressed.

                         DUROCHER

          He didn't come to play; he came to

          kill.

          Durocher starts out to the mound to talk to Higbe.

          Watching from right field, the black crowd still cheering.

          COLORED SECTION is packed solid, accentuated by the many

          empty seats in the sections on either side of it.

          INSERT: De Land, Florida.

          No score, top of the first as -- Jack drops a BUNT down the

          line. The FIRST BASEMAN fields, throw to the SECOND BASEMAN

          covering. Too late. Only Jack doesn't stop.

          Realizing the SHORTSTOP isn't covering the bag, Jack bolts

          for second. The second baseman has to wait on the throw and

          when he makes it -- The UMPIRE signals safe. A bunt double!

          Spider Jorgensen settles in the batter's box. The pitch.

          Crack, Jorgensen laces a single to left.

          Jack motors to third where Sukeforth is WAVING him home.

          We're with him at hip level as he tears down the basepath.

          The CATCHER bracing for the throw - they COLLIDE - he's SAFE! 

          As Jack gets to his feet, however, a Jim Crow POLICEMAN steps

          up to meet him, grabs him by the shoulder.

                         POLICEMAN

          It's against the law is why. No

          niggers don't play with no white

          boys. Git off or go to jail.

          Jack shrugs the policeman's hand off his shoulder. That

          sends him reaching for his nightstick and --

          Sukeforth is there to get between them.

                         JACK

          You swing that thing you better hit

          Robinson. Finally, he stops, heaving for breath, watching

          the train disappear around the bend. A lonely beat. Then --

          Ed gets down on his hands and knees. He sets his ear on the

          rail, closes his eyes. A thrum comes off the rail. A huge

          He may stay there or he may be

          brought to Brooklyn. But if Jackie

          does come up to the Dodgers, the

          biggest threat to his success, the

          one enemy most likely to ruin that

          success, is the Negro people

          themselves!

          There is shocked silence in the room. Rickey notices a group 

          of KIDS watching from a raised running track, soldiers on:

          I say it as cruelly as I can to

          make you all realize the weight of

          responsibility that is not only on

          myself and the Dodgers, but on

          Negroes everywhere. For on the day

          Jackie enters the National League,

          if he does, I have no doubt every

          one of you will form parades and

          welcoming committees. You'll

          strut. You'll wear badges. You'll

          hold Jackie Robinson days and

          Jackie Robinson nights. You'll get

          drunk, fight and be arrested.

          is fat and futile. You'll

          symbolize his importance into a

          national comedy and yes, a tragedy!

          So let me tell you this!

          (pounds his fist)

          If any group or segment of Negro

          society uses the advancement of

          Jackie Robinson in baseball as a

          triumph of race over race, I will

          regret the day I ever signed him to

          a contract, and I will personally

          see that baseball is never so

          abused and misrepresented again!

           down the walk. She watches. Something not quite right. 

           A tug as Jack stops, looks back at her. Fighting back her 

           emotion and then impelled forward, she runs to him. They 

           come together. She practically disappears in his arms. They

          Robinson be brought up from

          accept him? Once they see how he

          plays, how he can help them win.

          I'm not saying they won't accept

          us. He's hoping it'll get us more

          comfortable being around Robinson.

          Higbe clears his throat, reads what he's written:

          We, the undersigned Brooklyn

          Dodgers will not play ball on the

          same field as Jackie Robinson.

          Higbe signs it. He hands the pen to Bragan who adds his own

          name. Casey signs with a flourish. Casey holds out the pen

          to Walker who doesn't take it right away. An odd beat.

          Jack exits with his luggage. Looking for a cab, he sees

          Smith waiting. Smith offers a salute. Jack looks grumpy as

          he steps over. The Buick waiting beyond.

                         JACK

          You again.

          Smith leans back, blinks.

                         SMITH

          That's right. Me again. Something

          wrong with that, Jack?

                         JACK

          Come on.

           Jack continues past. As Smith follows...

          Traffic heavy. A glum silence in the car until...

                         SMITH

          They can't keep you on Montreal for

          long. After these exhibition

          games, they've got to bring you up.

                         (NO REPLY)

          You don't have two words to rub

          together, do you?

                         JACK

          Do I have to entertain you?

          More silence, then...

                         SMITH

          You ever wonder why I sit out in

          right field with my typewriter on

          my knees? Does that ever cross

          your mind?

          Jack stares out the passenger window, not in the mood. As he

          looks up at some of the taller buildings they pass...

                         SMITH

          It's because Negro reporters aren't

          allowed in the press box.

          Jack doesn't answer, doesn't look over. Finally Smith starts 

          talking to himself. Pretending to be Jack.

          SMITH a AS JACK' 

          You know, Wendell, I never asked

          you where you were from?

                         SMITH

          Why I'm from Detroit, Jack.

          SMITH a AS JACK'

          You don't say? Tell me more.

                         SMITH

          My daddy used to work at Fair Lane.

          That was Mr. Ford's estate. My

          daddy was Mr. Henry Ford's cook.

          SMITH a AS JACK'

          I did not know that.

                         SMITH

          Cooked for him for years, but never

          once broke bread with him. I'd go

          to work with daddy sometimes. Play

          baseball out on the lawn with Mr.

          Ford's grandchildren. We all had a

          real good time. But it was

          understood, if they got tired of

          playing ball and moved inside to

          the bowling alley or swimming pool,

          I was not invited or allowed. The

          grass was as far as I got. So

          guess what? You're not the only

          one with something at stake here.

                         JACK

          (after a beat)

          If I start talking, will you stop?

                         SMITH

          I'd be happy to.

          Smith stops at a red light. 

                         JACK

          I apologize. You've been there for

          me through this more than anyone

          besides Rae and Mr. Rickey. But I

          guess that's what bothers me.

                         SMITH

          How do you mean?

                         JACK

          I don't like needing someone to be

          there for me. I don't like needing

          anyone but myself. I never have.

                         SMITH

          You are a hard case, Jack Robinson.

          Is it okay if I keep driving you or

          should I let you out so you can

          walk?

          Jack bursts out laughing. So does Smith. 

                         JACK 

          You remember the last time we were 

          at a red light? Down in Florida? 

                         SMITH

          Branch Rickey cannot afford to

          upset team chemistry and so the

          only thing keeping Robinson off the

          Dodgers now, plainly, is the

                         BRANCA

          Hey, man. Ralph Branca.

          Last, but not least, Spider Jorgensen, his Montreal teammate.

                         JORGENSEN

          We made it, Jack, huh? Good luck.

          That's it. Everyone else is too busy to come over. As Jack

          scans for a locker with his name on it, BABE HAMBURGER, the

          clubhouse manager, steps over.

          WHITE 3-14-12 69.

                         BABE

          You're looking for your locker,

          huh, kid? Follow me.

          They walk over to a hook on the wall. A uniform hangs from

          it. A FOLDING CHAIR below.

          BABE (CONT'D)

          I just got the word. Best I could

          do. I'll get you straightened out

          tomorrow though, huh?

          Jack nods, unbuttoning his shirt... Stanky is suddenly there.

          All pugnacity as he gives up 4 inches and 40 pounds to Jack.

                         STANKY

          You're putting on that uniform, it

          means you're on my team. But before

          I play with you I want you to know

          how I feel about it. I want you to

          know I don't like it. I want you

          to know I don't like you.

          Jack regards him. Stanky doesn't flinch. Maybe he should.

                         JACK

           That's fine. That's how I prefer

           it. Right out in the open.

          Yeah, it's a shame about Leo.

                         RICKEY

          Inevitable I suppose. I asked him

          if she was worth it and he said

          yes. How's the retirement?

          uniform again. Roses look great 

          and I sleep a whole lot better.

          Roses and sleep are two wonderful 

          things, Burt. But sleep you can

          Baseball's the only life for an old

          my wife, Branch.

                         RICKEY

          Brooklyn vs. Philadelphia. The bottom of the first. The

          Eddie Stanky safe at first as

          Robinson steps to the plate.

          Jack walk to the plate, digs a cleat into the batter's box...

          CHAPMAN'S VOICE

          Hey! Hey you black Nigger!

          Jack looks to the visitor's dugout where the Phillies Alabama-

          born manager BEN CHAPMAN stands at the top of the steps.

          DBL. BLUE REV 7-9-12 75AA.

                         CHAPMAN

          Why don't you go back to the cotton

          fields where you belong!

          GREEN REV 4-27-12 76.

          The bear baiting has begun. Jack is in a kind of temporary

          shock. That's the Phillies manager! In uniform.

                         CHAPMAN

          Or did you swing your way out of

          the jungle?! Bring me a banana!

          124A RED BARBER - IN THE BOOTH 124A

                         BARBER

          Chapman the Phillies manager up on

          the top step, seems to be chirping

          something out to Robinson. Chapman

          a hothead during his playing days

          with the Yankees.

          125 RICKEY - IN THE STANDS 125

           Sitting next to Parrott. He leans forward, unsure.

                          RICKEY

           What's he saying?

                         126 VISITOR DUGOUT 126

           Chapman joined by two of his PHILLIE BENCH PLAYERS.

           PHILLIE ONE PHILLIE TWO

           Go home, Nigger! Go back to Africa!

          Phillie pitcher DUTCH LEONARD looks in. Jack has to try to

          concentrate on the pitch. Here it comes. A fastball well

          inside. Jack hits the deck to keep from getting beaned. 

                         CHAPMAN

          Bojangles! You sure can dance,

          snowflake!

                         STANKY

          On first, mouth hanging open. Almost forgets to take a lead.

          It's an instant Rorschach test.

                         DODGER DUGOUT

          Shotton and the players look stricken. Even Walker doesn't

          quite know what to make of it. No one enjoys it, but Higbe.

                         STANDS

          CONCESSION MEN walk closer to listen. The fans range from

          horrified to some mildly pleased. Rachel looks stricken.

          PINK REV 4-19-12 76A.

                         JACK

          A fastball inside. He leaps back again. This one was even 

          closer to hitting him. As Jack glares at Dutch...

                         UMPIRE

          Ball two!

          CHAPMAN'S VOICE

          Hey, black boy! Hey, shoe shine!

          WHITE 3-14-12 77.

          Jack doesn't want to look over, but he is compelled. The

          bench players flanking Chapman look furious, but Chapman is

          doing this with a sick sort of glee.

                         CHAPMAN

          You like white girls?! Huh?!

          Which one of them Dodger boys'

          wives are you climbing on tonight?!

          Chapman looks toward...

                         DODGER DUGOUT

          They don't like that one.

          CHAPMAN (CONT'D)

          Oh, I think I got it. Dixie, I

          believe I know!

                         JACK

          Grips the bat. Watches for the next pitch with bloody

          mindedness. He hacks at it, lofts a routine fly into left.

          He's about halfway down to first when the left fielder

          catches it and Jack can mercifully return to the dugout.

                         127 RICKEY 127

          Rickey watches as he disappears inside. Finally exhales.

                         128 BENCH 128

          Jack sits down. No one says anything to him. No one comes

          near him as he stares ahead, trapped in a kind of void. The

          closest player to him is Bobby Bragan. Bragan finally

          manages to glance over at him, then looks quickly away.

                         CUT TO:

                         129 RACHEL 129

          As the Dodgers take the field, Jack heads to first. Almost

          wincing, wondering if it's going to start again.

                         RACHEL

          (under her breath)

          Look at me, baby. Look at me.

          Finally, Jack glances up to her. She offers her eyes: I'm

          with you. He looks away. Her witnessing makes it worse.

                         130 BEN CHAPMAN 130

          Settles back in the shadows of the dugout. Finished for now.

                         INFIELD

          Spider Jorgensen takes a lead off first. At the plate,

          Stanky lines a single to right. Jorgensen holds at second.

                         JACK

          Steps to the batter's box, starts digging in that back foot.

          VISITOR'S DUGOUT

          As Chapman emerges with his two bench players. 

          PHILLIE ONE PHILLIE TWO 

          Hey, Nigger lips! Party's over, jungle bunny! 

                         CHAPMAN

          Hey, Pee Wee! Dixie! What's this

          Nigger doing for you all to let him

          drink from the same water fountain

          as you?! I hope it's worth it!

                         JACK

          Waiting for the pitch. Takes a mighty swing -- CRACKS a

          towering POP-UP between home plate and the mound. Dutch

          watches his catcher Seminick settle under it. Waiting.

                         DUTCH

          Hey, is that a home run!?

                         SEMINICK

          Yeah! If you're playing in an

          elevator shaft!

          Jack veers off the first baseline. Heads for the dugout.

                         CHAPMAN

          You don't belong! Look in a mirror!

          This is a white man's game. Get it

          through your thick monkey skull!

          Jack stops short looks at him. Chapman stands his ground.

                         RICKEY

          Stands, watches. Praying this doesn't go south. As Jack

          finally continues on, Rickey closes his eyes in relief.

                         RACHEL

          Sick for her husband.

          WHITE 3-14-12 79.

                         THE DUGOUT

          Jack stalks down past the team. No one looks at him. Bragan

          is ashamed. Dixie tries to look disinterested. Stanky and

          Reese exchange a helpless glance as Jack continues into:

                         132 THE TUNNEL 132

          Like a bull on his way to slaughter, he revolts. WHAM-WHAM!

          He proceeds to turn his bat into SPLINTERS. Concrete chips,

          wood flies. Jack drops the handle of the bat, pounds his

          fists. Heaving for breath, framed by the empty tunnel. Raw,

          electric, ungovernable. All the anger on display, the fury.

          FEET SCRAPE. Jack looks up to see Rickey standing there,

          watching, afraid to get too much closer.

                         JACK

          To hell with this. The next white

          son of a bitch who opens his mouth,

          I'll smash his goddamn teeth in.

          Rickey stands there until finally, opening his mouth...

                         RICKEY

          You can't, Jackie. You know it.

                         JACK

          I'm supposed to let this go on?

                         RICKEY

          These men have to live with

                         THEMSELVES --

                         JACK

          I have to live with myself, too!

          And right now I'm living a sermon

          out there. I'm through with it!

          Jack is at the end of his rope. All Rickey has are words.

                         RICKEY

          You don't matter right now, Jack.

          You're in this thing. You don't

          have the right to pull out from the

          backing of people who believe in

          you, respect you and who need you.

                         JACK

          Is that so?

                         RICKEY

          If you fight, they won't say

          Chapman forced you to; they'll just

          say that you're over your head.

          That you belong where you are.

          That every downtrodden man who

          wants more from life is over his

          head.

          Jack's either going to explode or break into tears.

                         JACK

          Do you know what it's like, having

          someone do this to you?!

                         RICKEY

          No. You do. You're the one living

          the sermon. In the wilderness.

          Forty days. All of it. Only you.

                         JACK

          And not a damn thing I can do about

          it.

                         RICKEY

          Of course there is! You can stand

          up and hit! You can get on base

          and you can score! You can win

          this game for us! We need you as

          well! Everyone needs you.

          (a beat; exhausted)

          You're medicine, Jack.

          Rickey reaches out, touches the wall to stay standing. Jack

          just breathes as familiar sounds reverb down the tunnel.

                         JACK

          They're taking the field.

                         RICKEY

          Who's playing first?

          Jack considers him. Everything hangs in the balance. Then:

                         JACK

          I'm gonna need a new bat.

           As Jack heads back down the tunnel for the field.

          Steps into the batter's box. Chapman and his sidekicks step

          from the Stygian abyss of the visitor's dugout.

          you know where you'd be right now?!

          On a bus headed down to Newport

          News cuz you can't play for shit!

          Here comes the pitch. Jack nonchalantly sticks his bat out,

          pokes a soft hit past second. A nothing hit, but he's

          standing on first. And he looks, well, ferocious in fact.

          As Pete Reiser steps up into the batter's box...

          Jack stares at Dutch Leonard. Assassin's eyes as he takes an

          insolent, in-your-face lead off first.

          Dutch fires to first. Jack dives back safe!

          Back on his feet, he spits out a piece of grit he picked up

          sliding back on his belly. Not bothering to dust himself

          off, he's turning into something elemental before our eyes.

          Dutch throws. Jack on the run as Reiser swings and misses -

          STRIKE THREE! - and Seminick comes up throwing.

          Jack slides into second, the throw high, ends up in center.

          Half a dozen Dodgers impulsively on their feet and waving him

          on as Jack gets to his feet and motors into THIRD. The throw

          well late. Phillies third baseman HANDLEY throws the ball

          back to Dutch. Handley then looks to Jack.

                         HANDLEY

          I'm sorry. I want you to know what

          goes on here, it don't go for me.

          We treat him the same way we do

          I'm going in that Phillie dugout

          When I first told you about Jackie,

          you were against it. Now all of a

          Well, any decent minded person --

                         RICKEY

          Sympathy, Harold, is a Greek word.

          It means to suffer. I sympathize

          with you means I suffer with you.

          This Philadelphia manager has done

                         RICKEY

          Is there an echo in here? Yes,

          he's creating sympathy on Jackie's

          No matter how fast you run, you'll

          never hit as much as you weigh.

           What is it, Rae?

           Nothing. It's just, sometimes when

           I sit up there with those bastards, 

           those loudmouths in the stands, I 

           know you can hear them.

          Isn't that dumb?

          Closing the space between them, he takes her hand.

          It worked. I didn't hear a thing.

          Is that so?

                         RACHEL

          It was the very first thing I

          noticed about him.

          How did you two meet?

                         RACHEL

          I saw him at a UCLA football game.

          Even in uniform with a helmet on,

          his vanity was awful. It was the 

          way he held his hands on his hips.

          I hated him!

                         (RICKEY LAUGHS)

          And on campus he always wore crisp

          white shirts and I'd think his skin

          is so dark, why would he do that?

          Then I got to know him, his pride

          and confidence, and I realized he

          was showing off his color. I was

          wrong. He wasn't conceited; he was 

          proud. Always, of who and what he 

          is. I'd never met another man like

          that. What about you? How did you

          meet your wife?

          For what?

                         RICKEY

          Everything. I can't apologize to

          him. He and I both knew what we

          were getting into. But you. A

          newlywed, trying to blossom a

          marriage under all this pressure.

                         RACHEL

          Your husband has humbled me. When

          this all began I thought I was

          changing the world and that Jackie

          was my instrument. Can you

          imagine? I wish I could help him,

          but I'm just a spectator.

                         RACHEL

          You help him plenty. Believe me.

          They watch him rip into another pitch.

                         RICKEY

          Is he able to get things off his

          chest? So he doesn't burn up?

                         RACHEL

          Yes. I have to let him have that

          silence at first, let him come to

          me. But he opens up eventually.

                         RICKEY

          Good. It's too much to carry

          inside. Does he have any friends

          on the team?

          (she gives him a look)

          They're spectators, too. They do

          admire him though.

          Rachel looks out to where Reese and Stanky play catch.

                         RACHEL

          Do you think so?

                         RICKEY

          Even the worst of us recognizes

          courage. Moral courage especially.

          I have to think they see it.

          Jackie's a man on trial. He's

          responding with glory and grace.

          No one can take their eyes off him.

                         RACHEL

          He's had himself on trial since the

          day I met him. No man is harder on

          himself or gets to himself worse

          than Jack. But I hope his team-

          mates know, they're on trial too.

                         RICKEY

          I suppose we all are. You're an

          astute woman, Mrs. Robinson.

           Finally, he comes around the corner where Jack sits at his 

          locker talking to Smith. 

                         PARROTT

          Jackie, excuse me, um, a request 

          came in. The Phillies manager Ben

          Chapman, he'd like his photo taken 

          with you.

          Jack pretends to sniff the air around Parrott.

          You been drinking, Harold?

                         PARROTT

          Mr. Rickey thinks it's a good idea.

          He says it'll be in every sports

          page in the country. An example

          that'll show everyone even the most

          hardened man can change.

                         JACK

          Chapman hasn't changed. He's just

          trying to take the heat off.

                         PARROTT

          Mr. Rickey says it doesn't matter

          if he's changed. As long as it

          looks like he's changed. Chapman 

          said he'd come down here. Or meet 

          you in the runway. 

          As Jack slow burns...

                         SMITH 

          See the ball come in slow. See the

          Chapman makes a little speech. Hypocrisy at its best.

          Jackie's been accepted in baseball

          and the Philadelphia organization

          wish him all the luck we can. I

          only hope in some small way our

          You want a picture? Sure.

          Jack steps to the on-deck circle, grabs a BASEBALL BAT.

          Chapman's eyes widen as he starts toward him with it.

          We'll hold the bat. That way we

          don't have to touch skin.

          Chapman nods, looks relieved. A photographer hands over a

          bat. Chapman has two hands on the handle. Jack puts one

          hand on the barrel, the other stays on his hip.

          I got this letter, sir. I guess

          some people aren't too happy about

          me playing with Robinson.

          Rickey is not liking where this is going; he motions for the

          It's not typical to me.

          Does Jackie know?

                         RICKEY

          Of course he knows. And the FBI.

          They're taking a threat in

          Cincinnati pretty seriously. So

          I understand. I bet Jackie just

          wants to play ball. I bet he wishes

          he wasn't leading the league in hit

          by pitch. I bet he wishes people

          didn't want to kill him. But the

          -- High on Jack's right calf. Slaughter's spiked him

          something wicked. Jack goes down in a heap clutching his

          leg, blood already seeping through his high socks.

          Slaughter, head down, on his way to the visitor's dugout as

          Dodger players pour out of their own to protest. As the UMP

          raises his hands, motions them all back... Jack pulls up his

          sock, a bloody mess. Stanky looks to Casey.

                         STANKY

          Next batter, throw right at his

          head. Clean his clock --

                         JACK

                         (FIERCE)

          Just get him out. Understand?

          Game's too important.

          As Casey nods, Jack reaches up to Stanky and Reese.

          They pull him to his feet. Jack looks, finds Rachel in the

          stands. As he gives her a little wave: a I'm okay.'

          The top of the 12th and Kurowski at

          the plate. He hit his 20th home

          run on Monday so Casey's going to

          want to be careful with him.

          The stadium electric as Jack steps in, his left leg bloody.

          He takes an inside pitch at the knees. Bastards!

          Here comes the next one. WHACK - He singles hard up the

          middle, nearly takes the pitcher's head off.

                         FIRST BASE

          He rounds hard, returns to the bag. Reiser stepping up to

          the plate as Musial holds Jack on at first. Jack in a fury.

                         JACK

          I don't care what happens, I don't

          care what kind of play it is, when

          I get to second I'm gonna knock

          Jack running on the pitch. Reiser bunts. The play is to

          first. Reiser is out and Jack slides safe into second.

          SCHOENDIENST has the sense to vacate before he gets there.

                         JACK

          Bouncing up and down, wearing that badge of potential

          violence and action. The crowd buzzing, the electricity

          practically hits you in the face. Jack's going to score.

          Coming up out of his seat along with the fans around him.

                         JACK

          Walker at bat. Jack steps out, checks on MARION the

          shortstop. He takes another step out, looks to Schoendienst.

           Munger sets. Robbie back and forth

           deals a pick off throw to Marion at 

           second and Robinson is out! 

           Marion breaks for the bag and Munger turns and fires a 

           strike. Marion brings down the tag -- Out! 

           He is and he knows it. The crowd stunned into silence. Jack 

           frozen a moment, head down, furious with himself. Low.

           BARBER'S VOICE

          Get out. Let me talk to my first

          baseman. Go. He's getting

          stitched up for Pete's sake.

          The reporters move off for other interviews. Reporter Two

          hesitant to let it go, finally drifts off. Rickey watches.

          Sticking up for yourself is what

          you'd expect of any man. Some find

          Sorry? Sorry for what?

                         JACK

          I lost my cool out there. It

          probably cost us the game.

          Do you know what I saw this

          Sitting on a fastball?

           Wiping his hands on his pants,

          Why are you doing this, Mr. Rickey?

                         RICKEY

          We had victory over fascism in

          Germany; it's time for victory over

          racism at home.

          Why are you doing this? Come on

          now.

          A long moment between them. Finally, Rickey looks away.

                         RICKEY

          I love this game. I love baseball.

          I've given my life to it. Forty

          odd years ago I was a player coach

          at Ohio Wesleyan University. We

          had a Negro catcher, best hitter on

          the team. Charley Thomas.

          Rickey starts slowly rubbing the baseball in his hands.

                         RICKEY

          A fine young man. I saw him laid

          low. Broken because of the color

          of his skin and I didn't do enough

          to help. I told myself I did, but

          I didn't. The game I loved had

          something unfair at the heart of

          it. I ignored it. But a time came

          when I could no longer do that.

                         (LOOKS UP)

          You let me love baseball again.

          Thank you.

          Jack's eyes gentle on Rickey's.

          You're a force of nature, Jackie,

          you've complicated everything but

          yourself. You're changing the

          world, and refusing to let it

          change you. I for one am in awe.

          Jack reaches, takes the baseball from him. A beat as they

          consider each other. Finally, a promise... 

                         JACK

          I won't get picked off second base

                         JACK

          And what'll happen then?

          She clucks a 'hit' sound, makes an 'ahhhhhh' crowd sound.

                         JACK

          We win enough of these next games

          and we'll bring home the pennant.

                         RACHEL

          Pennant? Where are we going to put

          a pennant? All these baby diapers

          hanging everywhere.

          Jack looks around the room, at the diapers hanging.

                         JACK

          We got room right over there.

           We did it, Boss! We did it! We

           swept Cincinnati! That puts us 

           seven games up. 

          Joyous, Rickey grabs a sheet showing the NL standings.

                         RICKEY

          And eliminates the Giants and 

          Boston.

          He puts an a X' through Boston and the Giants. The rest of

          the NL are already crossed out. Only the Cardinals remain.

          At the same time, Parrott X's the same out on his notebook.

          We'd have to lose nearly every game

          for the Cardinals to catch us now.

          One more win may do it. Who's

          pitching tomorrow for the Pirates?

           moves, the RADIO BROADCAST of the Dodgers' game can be heard 

           from one house to the next. In a gap, a passing car picks it 

           up and we hear it from the window. Then another house. 

          BARBER'S VOICE

          A very big game today here in

          Pittsburgh. A win and the Dodgers

          You don't belong! You'll never

          belong!

          Jack waits. Ostermueller pitches.

          Ostermueller winds and throws, low

          and away ball two. Fritz seems to

          be pitching around Jackie. Or

          trying to get him to chase.

                         RACHEL

          3 and 0 now. Robinson waiting on

          something he can swing on.

          As catcher Kluttz throws it back...

          Give me something I can hit!

          Careful what you wish for boy...

          Ostermueller nods at the sign. Jack about to slay the dragon

          as the pitch comes in - WHACK! The ball is going for a ride.

          BARBER'S VOICE

          That is a deep fly ball to left.

          He runs toward first and we run with him. The smile starts

          somewhere in his body. His heart most likely. By the time

          it reaches his face, his joy has erupted. The weight of the

          BLUE REV 4-07-12 120.

          Branch Rickey was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1967. 

          Pee Wee Reese was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1984.

          Bobby Bragan retired the following year and became a manager

          in the Dodger minor leagues. He is credited with mentoring

          several African American minor league players.

          Wendell Smith became the first African-American sportswriter 

          to join the Baseball Writers Association in 1948.

          Ben Chapman was fired in 1948 and never managed again.

          Eddie Stanky went on to manage the St. Louis Cardinals, the 

          Chicago White Sox and the Texas Rangers. 

          Ralph Branca lives and works in Rye, New York. 

          Dixie Walker was traded the following season to Pittsburgh.

          Ed Charles grew up to become a professional baseball player.

          He won the World Series in 1969 with the Miracle Mets.

          Rachel Robinson splits her time between Connecticut and

          Manhattan where she runs the Jackie Robinson Foundation.

          Jackie Robinson was named Major League Rookie of the Year in 

          1947. He won the World Series in 1955 against the New York 

          Yankees, stealing home in Game One. He was elected to the 

          Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962. 

          We end on a montage of Jackie Robinson Day in present time.

          Every year in April, all MLB players wear the number 42 as a

          reminder of Jackie's accomplishments on and off the field.

          The number 42 is the only number retired by all of baseball.

          We see 42s leaving their dugouts, 42s at bat, 42s in the

          field, 42s signing autographs, 42s stealing bases, 42s lined

          up for the National Anthem.

          FREEZE FRAME on a 42.
