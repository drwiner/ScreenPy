1.          Small, student's     French-type    garret    decorated

in deep-red, suitcase on bed.         Anthony to his desk,

hurriedly examining his thick papers and books, and

throwing them on the floor.          Takes a book (closeup

                                (Pause)

                         Yes.

Shot of father and son, son in jeans, boots and vest,

long hair, early     twenties, his hair getting longer with

the progress of the movie, his features, icily handsome,

becoming more and more expressive and tender.

                         You quit.

          A :* :                (Inwardly)

                        Yea.

(A.'s small pocket knife is out, playing the edge with his

nail, shot close of his hands slightly quivering with

inner tension.)

                        I can see you're on acid,

             Father:

                        my mind is blown.

(Gently out of tension rubs the inside of his upper leg)

                                (Looking at him as he

             Father:

                               does this)

                        I think you're sick.

A. striking match, watches it burn.            Telephone      rings.

Father picks up phone.         Pause.

Strange voice hissing over the phone:

                        sssssss.

Hanging up.

Father, bothered, hanging up.            The match in A.'s hand

burns out.      Father sees it go out.

A; rising, not looking at his Father, walking to elevator

which opens directly on the luxurious apartment.

                      I need a woman, Dad. I'm

                      going out and find a woman, Dad-

F. startled, very distant, slowly wondering aloud:

                      You really are sick . . . You

                     have no idea      really of what

                      reality is.

A, turning around at entrance to elevator which opens

as he talks.                                 Then softer:

                Looking at Father hard.

                                           Right here.

                      Reality I have.

                            (Gesturing with his

                           hand to his genitals)

                      Right here.

                            (Head)

                      Right here.

                            (Heart)

                      So man . . .

                            (Softly)

                      Dad . . . don't ever tell

inside the Temple and two of the Brothers are dancing

softly to the sound of soul music.

            The white world is for the most part outside the

Temple, sprawled about it in the thick grass, relaxing.

Some have beards, others have shaved, but their faces are

hard and dirty, dust and dirt is deeply ingrained in the

cracks of skin,    Anthony is an exception, he has kept him-

self clean, his beard barely visible, although there are

small lines of fatigue under his eyes and a small scar

under his left eye, the result of a previous wound, not

serious.    He tends to rub it occasionally.    Ironically,    in

the war, he has become even softer. Time has crumbled:

he is spacing himself.

            The contrast is made then, by camera CloseuPs,

of the black and white features,     The Blacks are tenderer,

softer.     The Whites are tired, cruel.   The blacks Sing-

Dance.     Although inside they are as blue as the sky, and

scared.

as he walks, the sun gleaming through the trees, almost

moving with him, seen and then not seen and seen again.

From a distance, inside the temple, on the radio, Sam

Cooke's song "Cupid" is playing loud, and sort of sad like

all Cooke's songs , giving a texture of music and sunlight

to his walk.

             He breaks through the thicket into the crystal

clear sun shining over the tiny clearing around the

Temple.     The Whites sprawled about.

             As he breaks through the thicket, Anthony, wear-

ing silver bracelets and a Buddhist medallion around his

neck and a ruffled dirty shirt, his hair unkempt, longer

than before, is taking his picture from a distance through

a telephoto-lensed        camera, which for the first time, he

is playing, and as the two brothers dance, Francis, who

has a very high singing voice, though not as good as

Smokey's whom most people mistake for a woman he sings so

'tenderly,   starts to sing with the radio:

             People say I'm the life of the party

             As he sings, the rest do not look at him sing,

they know he can sing, they've heard this song a hundred

times, they know it too.      They lie where they are, look at

what they do, and deep inside, where it's blue, they listen.

some relationship to the surrounding dream world of The

Forest, but isn*t really significant and like the singing,

              Rhah:     If you're going to do it, do it right.

            Werner, raising his head:

                       Oh it doesn't bother me what Rhah says.

He can't even begin to bother me.                    see I know what he

to search for new interpretations, there is a real feeling

for love, which is really a source without words.

               The screen slowly comes to light and we see a

young tribe, maybe a dozen, dancing freely in the forest by

a stream.        Perhaps they are the enemy, it is not made clear

children, white and black.                  They dance hugging each other,

their long hair jumping, in all sorts of love contortions

that display their freedom.                     They are all in love with each
