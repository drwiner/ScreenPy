                         WALL STREET: MONEY NEVER SLEEPS

                                   Written by

                                   Allan Loeb

          A BLACK SCREEN

          Onto which is written in white letters...

          "When business in the United States underwent a

          contraction... the Federal Reserve created more paper

          reserves.

          The excess credit spilled over into the market triggering a

          fantastic speculative boom... "

          EXT. CLINTON CORRECTIONAL FACILITY - DAY

          It's a summer day. The heat floats above the pavement.

          A cab waits in the lot.

          The large gates of New York's largest prison open and today's

          group of newly released emerge.

          They pass a guard who lifts up a copy of The USA Today to

          reveal the headlines and date that tells us it's 2002.

          Amongst this group we find a man carrying a small duffel.

          And we know this man. He is Gordon Gekko.

          But he is not as slick as we remember... he doesn't have that

          gleam in his eyes or that gel in his hair. No, this is a

          very different version of the man we remember... because now

          there's nothing behind those eyes... nothing we can read

          anyway.

          And he just stands there... coldly watching his recently

          freed brethren greet their wives and children... reuniting

          with the people who waited for them... the people who love

          them.

          The cab slowly pulls up and Gordon holds up a finger... wait

          a minute. He glares over to the entrance of the lot...

          waiting for his people... but they don't come.

          And the cab waits... Gordon stands there... in the heat...

          completely disappointed... and completely alone.

          And we...

          SLAM BACK INTO

          As the white letters reappear on the screen...

          "As a result... the American economy collapsed...

          Taken from an article about the pre-crash 1929...

          ... written by Alan Greenspan."

                          JACOB (V.O.)

           It's funny, the more we find ourselves

           slaves of chance... the more

           superstitious we become.

           2.

          SLAM INTO: A MANHATTAN MORNING

          A gorgeous June Friday.

                          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           And that would make Andrew Zabel one

           superstitious motherfucker.

          Find ANDREW ZABEL, mid 50s, shaved-head and in good shape.

                          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           He started every day the same exact

           way. He would walk his dogs then

           leave his Gramercy Park condo at seven

           am on the dot.

          As Andrew leaves 36 East Gramercy Park East, an impressive

          building made of white stone.

          Andrew wears a suit and holds an umbrella.

                          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           And he would take an umbrella with him

           even when there was no chance of

           rain...

          As Andrew heads to a newsstand and throws the INDIAN CLERK a

          familiar nod. And without saying a word, the clerk knows

          exactly what to give him.

                          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           He'd buy a journal, a tin of chocolate

           Altoids and a cold bottle of Poland

           Springs water.

          23RD ST SUBWAY STATION

          As Andrew bounds down the stairs and through the gate...

                          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           He had timed it out so he wouldn't

           have to wait more than three minutes

           for the uptown five train.

          As Andrew emerges out to the platform and sees the headlight

          from the 5 train coming down the tunnel.

                          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           I guess you could say that day was

           like every other...

          And as the train approaches... holding that Wall Street

          Journal... the bottle of water and that tin of Altoids...

                          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           Except for one thing...

          ... Andrew Zabel simply steps forward and falls onto the

          track.

           3.

          And as the train SLAMS into US...

                         DARKNESS

          Which holds for an uncomfortably long moment, then...

          "Money Never Sleeps" graces the screen... and we move down

          below the letters to find...

                         A CHART

          Now filling the screen. It's of the Dow Jones Industrial

          Average. It's for the year 2008 and it's down to the

          right... not good.

          A circle marks Friday June 13th. Follow a blue line back

          three days and stop. Another circle is now formed and

          Matthew Good's "Giant" rings out...

          CARD: JUNE 6th 2008... 8 DAYS EARLIER...

                         MIDTOWN

          Opening titles... the workplace throng... listening to their

          iPods, checking their Blackberrys and sipping their

          Starbucks.

          Move with this throng, to the Matthew Good tune, under the

          opening titles, past 745 Seventh Avenue, the Lehman Brothers

          building... with that giant ticker that rounds the building

          posting Dow 12,579.76 -- +119.86

          And keep moving... all is normal in the financial center of

          the universe.

          Land on a impressive modern building made of glass and steel

          then climb up it to the top... to the penthouse office

          suites.

          And push in through the window to be in...

          INT. KELLER, ZABEL INVESTMENTS/ANDREW ZABEL'S OFFICE - DAY

          An impressive office with a 180 degree view of southern

          Manhattan. Zabel sits behind his desk.

                          ZABEL

           Go ahead, open it.

          And across from Andrew Zabel sits JACOB L. MOORE... who holds

          his bonus check.

                          JACOB

           Really?

          On the wall over Zabel's shoulder runs an electronic ticker

          with the major indices and just one stock... ticker KZI...

          Keller Zabel Investments.

           4.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           I thought that because of the problems

           with the credi--

                          ZABEL

           Screw the credit derivative desk, I

           don't understand half the shit they do

           anyway.

          Zabel forces a smile. But Jacob can tell something's wrong

          with him.

                          JACOB

           Are you okay?

          Zabel doesn't answer... he just nods to the envelope.

                          ZABEL

           Open it.

          He opens the envelope and looks down at the check.

          $1,450,000. And he can barely contain his excitement.

                          JACOB

           Thank you.

          And we get a good look at Jacob now... boyish features that

          display humility with a trace of mischievousness thrown in.

          He's definitely sexy, definitely cerebral and definitely

          winning.

                          ZABEL

           I'm proud of you, Jacob.

          And Jacob tries to play it cool as he looks up at the

          electronic ticker on the wall... 12,592.46 -- +132.46... KZI

          $71.67... +$3.12.

          CLOSE ON A RING

           SALESMAN (V.O.)

           Princess cut, platinum banded, five

           carat, completely colorless round

           center stone with a medium girdle and

           excellent polish.

          Pull back to be in...

          INT. TIFFANY'S - DAY

          Jacob inspects the ring then looks up to the fey salesman.

                          JACOB

           Yeah, it's nice. But here's the

           thing...

          He looks around the store for a moment, then...

           5.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           I want to see the "fuck you" room.

                          SALESMAN

           The "fuck you" room?

                          JACOB

           Yes. The room where you sell me a

           fuck you ring for fuck you money.

                          SALESMAN

           The private client foyer.

          And with a big smile...

                          JACOB

           What did I say?

          INT. JACOB'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Two bedroom in a Murray Hill high rise. Jacob watches Fox

          Business on his tv. A much nicer, much bigger, much flatter

          plasma sits against the wall under it waiting to be

          installed.

          A promo plays for a magazine show being narrated by Cody

          Willard.

           CODY WILLARD (ON TV)

           Tomorrow night we explore the excesses

           of hedge fund managers.

          Different pictures flash on the screen of private jets,

          massive mansions, expensive watches and wines.

           CODY WILLARD (ON TV) (CONT'D)

           Whether they're spraying $5000 a

           bottle champagne at Voile Rouge in

           Saint-Tropez, ordering a $10,000

           Martini at The Algonquian Hotel with a

           diamond on the bottom or eating a gold

           dusted $175 hamburger at the Wall

           Street Burger Shoppe...

          Now the flashes are of some of the top HEDGE FUND MANAGERS in

          the business that we'll see later... one of them is a man

          named BRETTON WOODS... maybe we hold a little longer on him

          to get a good look... Mid 40s, good looking and refined.

           CODY WILLARD (ON TV) (CONT'D)

           ... these cowboys of finance always

           seem to land on their feet.

          Jacob lets out a little laugh and mutes the tv.

          He grabs the phone and makes a call...

           6.

                          JACOB

                          (INTO PHONE)

           I know you're at the fund raiser

           tonight but I wanted to say hi.

                          (BEAT)

           Okay, best part... getting my bonus

           check. Worst part...

          He grabs a framed picture of her and looks at it.

          She's in workout gear, wearing earbuds, obviously just off a

          run, caught off guard and thus flipping him the finger...

          it's adorable.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

                          (INTO PHONE)

           ... it was right after I ordered lunch

           and I remembered that we're not seeing

           each other this weekend.

          And he finishes his message to her...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

                          (INTO PHONE)

           Okay, text me yours and I'll read them

           in my sleep. I love you.

          As Jacob disconnects and looks out the window... looking out

          at Third Avenue twinkling up into Midtown.

          AND WERE BACK ON THE CHART

          Where the blue line travels down the Dow trend line, down and

          to the right then stops on Thurs June 12th.

          CARD: 6 DAYS LATER

          INT. KELLER, ZABEL INVESTMENTS/TRADING FLOOR - MORNING

          A large space lined with long desks that hold five TRADERS

          each. Each trader has two phones and three huge monitors in

          front of them.

          It's loud and frenetic. Most of the traders are under thirty-

          five, it's a young person's game.

          Jacob heads in and takes his seat at his desk. It's larger

          than the others and anchors the room... this is his domain.

          Fox Business plays on each of the screens that line the space

          ubiquitous. (A note, when possible, business news will be

          droning from television sets throughout this movie in bg...

          as it is the current soundtrack of New York these days)

          A trader named WILLY shouts out...

                          WILLY

           Jake, Glass Works is up nine points on

           earnings, you want to unload some?

           7.

          Jacob confirms...

                          JACOB

           Yeah, let's get closer to home.

          A trader named AUDRY turns to Jacob.

                          AUDRY

           (to Jacob, re Willy)

           Where's his hat?

          Willy glares at her.

                          WILLY

           Mind your own business, Audry.

                          AUDRY

           I had to wear Pfizer on my forehead

           for a full week... so post it up,

           bitch.

          Willy pleads with Jacob...

                          WILLY

           C'mon Jake, it's embarrassing.

          Jacob just shrugs...

                          JACOB

           The stock goes down, you wear the

           crown... them's the rules.

          Audry grins in victory.

          Willy shakes his head, grabs a marker, scribbles something

          down on a post-it then places it on his forehead. It reads

          "I bought Toll Brothers at $24" and he has to wear it all

          week.

          And Jacob laughs... now looking up at the electronic

          ticker... KZI $60.21... -$2.25...

          INT. ONE OAK - NIGHT

          An ultra exclusive club reserved for Wall Street money-men,

          Hollywood players, gangstas and supermodels.

          TI's "Whatever You Like" blares.

          The dance floor is packed with New York's privileged draped

          in Prada and dripped in sweat.

          Jacob heads a table of five men who are all in suits. They

          are all in various areas of finance... a HEDGE FUND Portfolio

          Manager, a DERIVATIVES TRADER, a PRIVATE EQUITY CFO and a

          QUANT ANALYST.

          The quant stares at a HIGH CLASS CALL GIRL working the room

          across the way. He then turns back to the guys with...

           8.

                          QUANT ANALYST

           Girl like that cost a thousand bucks

           last year... now it's up to five.

                          JACOB

           Getting priced out of the hooker

           bubble?

          Confirming in frustration...

                          QUANT ANALYST

           Goddamn bull market's killing my sex

           life.

          They all laugh.

           HEDGE FUND PM

           Don't worry... it's not such a bull

           market anymore. She'll be trading at

           five hundred soon enough.

          The laughter dies down.

                          DERIVATIVES TRADER

           (turning to Jacob)

           It's true. I'm actually shocked KZI

           gave you a bonus of that size.

                          JACOB

           Why?

          Private Equity CFO nudges Hedge Fund PM in reference to the

          woman who just took the seat at the next table...

           HEDGE FUND PM

                          (DISMISSIVE)

           Yeah, I'm going long Boeing.

           PRIVATE EQUITY CFO

           Oh, I didn't notice.

          Confused...

                          QUANT ANALYST

           Really? The 787 is having problems.

          As Hedge Fund PM opens a bottle of Krug, Clos du Mesnil 1995

          and pours it into the flutes.

                          JACOB

           (to Derivatives Trader)

           Why? Why are you so shocked?

          Offering Jacob a flute...

           HEDGE FUND PM

           Because they're in serious trouble.

          Declining the champagne...

           9.

                          JACOB

           We're not in serious trouble.

           It's a rumor.

          A woman takes the table next to them and this makes

          Derivatives Trader perk up and say.

                          DERIVATIVES TRADER

           I think Goodyear Tire is definitely a

           buy.

          Hedge Fund PM checks out the woman.

           HEDGE FUND PM

           Totally. And those tires are real.

          Even more confused...

                          QUANT ANALYST

           Goodyear? The chart is horrible.

           PRIVATE EQUITY CFO

           Somebody color the quant in here.

          Hedge Fund PM leans into Quant and explains...

           HEDGE FUND PM

           Boeing, ticker BA... Big Ass.

           Goodyear, ticker GT... Great Tits.

                          QUANT ANALYST

           (realizing...)

           Oh, it's like a code.

          And Private Equity CFO turns to Jacob with...

           QUANT ANALYST (CONT'D)

           You guys were down three points in an

           up market today.

                          JACOB

           Whatever, somebody was adding to their

           short.

          As a supermodel now joins the next table.

           HEDGE FUND PM DERIVATIVES TRADER

          Going long Starwood. Starwood's a buy!

                          QUANT ANALYST

           (figuring it out)

           Starwood, ticker HOT. Yeah but... I'm

           more a buyer of...

          The guys just shake their heads...

          EXT. LOWER BROADWAY - NIGHT

          Jacob and Derivatives Trader enjoy the summer night. Out of

          all the guys, he's closest to Jacob. His name is Robby.

                          JACOB

           Can I ask you something, Robby?

          Robby nods.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           What's your number?

                          ROBBY

           Huh?

                          JACOB

           You know what I mean. The amount of

           money you would need to fuck it all

           and walk away... if you wanted to.

                          ROBBY

           Do you want to walk away?

                          JACOB

           Not now. But one day... I don't know.

           When I have a family. It's just so

           consuming... so many marriages get

                          FUCKED UP--

                          ROBBY

           Wall Street divorce lawyers do great

           in any market.

                          JACOB

           Exactly.

                          (BEAT)

           I've thought about it. What I would

           need... to raise a family, live a good

           life, be secure. It's not as much as

           we would think if you move out of New

           York.

          And it dawns on Robby...

           11.

                          ROBBY

           Aha... when did you buy the ring?

          Jacob smiles at his friend's perception.

                          JACOB

           Last week.

                          ROBBY

           So when are you going to ask her?

                          JACOB

           I'm going to DC this weekend.

                          ROBBY

           Good. I like her for you. She's one

           of the good ones...

                          (BEAT)

           Did you hear what her father said on

           Charlie Rose?

          Jacob shakes his head.

                          ROBBY (CONT'D)

           Something about Bear Stearns being the

           first rain drop of the impending

           mother of all storms.

                          JACOB

           Sour grapes.

                          ROBBY

           He's speaking at Columbia on Friday.

           If it's slow enough, a few of us might

           play hookie and check it out... he's

           the best show in town.

          And they continue to walk, until...

                          JACOB

           Tell me what you hear.

          Robby slowly nods...

                          ROBBY

           I don't think you want to hear it,

           bro. You worship Zabel and it's not

           good.

                          JACOB

           I don't worship him. He's done a lot

           for me and I've known him a long time.

           But he's been acting strange lately.

                          (BEAT)

           Just tell me what you hear.

                          ROBBY

           That Keller Zabel is holding toxic

           waste they can't find a market for.

           12.

          Jacob shakes his head...

                          JACOB

           It's not true. It's rumors. There

           are hedge funds with huge short

           positions...

                          ROBBY

           Jacob, you know better. You know it

           doesn't matter if they're rumors or

           not.

          And Robby stops walking.

                          ROBBY (CONT'D)

           Senior year I couldn't get my mind

           around how all those dot coms with no

           earnings were worth billions of

           dollars and you were the one who said

           something that made it all clear for

           me.

                          JACOB

           I don't remember.

          Turning to Jacob with...

                          ROBBY

           "An asset's value can only be priced

           at its perception."

                          JACOB

           I said that?

          Robby confirms... then...

                          ROBBY

           So buddy -- it don't matter if the

           rumors are true or not. Because in

           this climate... if they exist at

           all... then most likely...

          Looking his friend head on...

                          ROBBY (CONT'D)

           ... you're going to cease to.

          EXT. 533 THIRD AVENUE - MORNING

          Jacob leaves his Murray Hill building apartment and nods to

          his doorman, DIEGO.

                          DIEGO

           J to the Acob -- morning to you,

           brother.

          Jacob smiles...

                          JACOB

           Diego...

           13.

          And Jacob waits for the morning joke.

                          DIEGO

           Okay, what's the best aphrodisiac on

           Wall Street?

                          JACOB

           I don't know.

                          DIEGO

           Jet fuel.

          Diego cracks up. Jacob just shakes his head and moves on.

          And Jacob walks uptown... deep in thought. It's a gorgeous

          June Friday.

          Suddenly, Jacob just stops walking and stands there for a

          long moment... coming to a decision.

          And as Jacob turns around and starts heading the other way...

          INT. 36 GRAMERCY PARK EAST/LOBBY - MORNING

          Jacob smiles to the doorman.

                          JACOB

           I'm here to see Andrew Zabel.

                          DOORMAN

           Is he expecting you?

                          JACOB

           No.

          INT. LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

          The elevator opens and Andrew Zabel appears with two adorable

          Bichon Frise puppies. Jacob stands.

                          ZABEL

           Jacob...

                          JACOB

           Andy. I'm sorry to come by like this

           but the rumors are now hitting a fever

           pitch and I wanted to make sure

           everything was okay.

          Zabel nods and heads for the door.

                          ZABEL

           Come on...

          EXT. GRAMERCY PARK - MORNING

          As they enter through the gates of the park and walk...

           14.

                          JACOB

           Is everything okay?

          And Andrew Zabel doesn't seem all there... introspective and

          blank.

                          ZABEL

           I remember when the starter gave me

           this bushy hair twelve year old kid

           and I said; "Donny, what the fuck --

           give me a real caddy." And he said;

           "This kid's the best."

                          JACOB

                          ANDY--

                          ZABEL

           And you were. You had the wind down,

           the grade of every green.

                          JACOB

           What's going on?

                          ZABEL

           But you wouldn't shut up about stocks.

           Twelve years old and you blabbed on

           and on about companies and sectors and

           earnings.

                          JACOB

           Andy, are we going under?

                          ZABEL

           What was that piece of shit you loved?

           That airline equipment supplier who

           was branching out into car airbags--

                          JACOB

           Flour Controls. Are you okay?

          Zabel laughs.

                          ZABEL

           Flour Controls... what a dog.

                          JACOB

           Why did you give me that bonus?

          Zabel stops walking and faces Jacob with...

                          ZABEL

           Because I know you, Jacob. And I know

           you've been holding off because you

           didn't think you had enough. We all

           do that... postpone life until we

           believe we have what it takes to

           actually live it.

           15.

                          JACOB

           There isn't a better money-runner on

           the street... we'll get through this.

                          ZABEL

           Marry her, Jacob. And have children

           with her and spend as much time as you

           can with them... and never forget that

           that's what's important.

          And Jacob L. Moore... looking his boss head on...

                          JACOB

           Andrew, if there's anyway I can help --

           give back the bonus -- whatever... all

           you have to do is say the word.

          And Zabel just looks away...

                          ZABEL

           There's just so much you don't know,

           Jacob.

          INT. KELLER, ZABEL INVESTMENTS/TRADING FLOOR - DAY

          The normally very loud and frenetic place is very quiet and

          sober today. They all watch Alexis Glick report...

           ALEXIS GLICK (ON THE TVS)

           Rumors of insolvency have hit the

           street concerning KZI's books and

           they're shooting first then asking

           questions later. The stock is now

           trading just a bit over thirty one

           dollars a share, down almost forty

           four percent on the session.

          And standing in the center of the floor, watching this...

                         JACOB

          Stunned... horrified... his universe becoming unglued.

          And he turns to Audry... helpless and in shock.

                          JACOB

           Who did this to us?

          She can only shrug... tears in her eyes.

          Jacob shifts his gaze over to the trading floor's electronic

          ticker on the wall... KZI $26.34... -$29.57.

          And he moves for the elevator banks... unable to take it

          anymore.

          EXT. MIDTOWN -DAY

          Furious, Jacob walks down 6th ave with his phone to his ear.

           16.

                          JACOB

           Andrew, call me back. I'm going to

           find out who did this to us. I swear

           to God... if it's the last thing I do.

                          (BEAT)

           We're going to bounce back from this.

           And we're going to find out who spread

           the rumor... and then we're going to

           destroy them.

          He disconnects the call and keeps walking.

          After a beat, with his anger brewing... Jacob SLAMS his phone

          down on the ground and it shatters.

          INT. JACOB'S APARTMENT - DAY

          Jacob lays on his couch vacantly pondering the ceiling.

          Fox Business plays on the new plasma tv on the wall...

          footage of THE GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK, a tough looking man in

          his 40s, speaking to the press outside of The State Capitol.

                          GOVERNOR (FOOTAGE)

           I don't know anything about the

           solvency of Keller Zabel. I do know

           that what's bringing down the stock at

           this precise moment are rumors. And

           this practice of short selling

           American financial institutions then

           floating rumors in order to profit

           from them must be stopped. The uptick

           rule must be reinstated.

          Jacob glares over to the tv.

           GOVERNOR (FOOTAGE) (CONT'D)

           And once again, I will point to

           largely unregulated world of hedge

           funds... an ever-growing and

           increasing powerful area of the market

           that I repeatedly tried to regulate as

           Chairman of the SEC...

          And there's a loud knock on the door. Jacob ignores it.

           GOVERNOR (FOOTAGE) (CONT'D)

           And the collapse of this legendary New

           York financial institution is why I

           continue to fight that battle as

           Governor of this great state.

          Another knock... this time louder. Jacob mutes the tv.

                          JACOB

           What?

          From the door...

           17.

                          ROBBY

                          (SHOUTING)

           Jacob... answer the door.

          Jacob gets up, moves slowly and answers the door.

                          ROBBY (CONT'D)

           You weren't answering your phone.

                          JACOB

           It broke.

          Robby sharply nods.

                          ROBBY

           Dude...

          He stops short... swallows...

                          JACOB

           What?

                          ROBBY

           I just found this out and it hasn't

           hit the press yet.

          Once again... he stops short and looks away in frustration.

                          JACOB

           What? Robby, what are you trying to

           say?

                          ROBBY

           Andrew Zabel threw himself in front of

           the subway this morning.

          Jacob just stands in that doorway. No reaction at all.

          Absolutely frozen.

          INT. JACOB'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

          Jacob now stands in the center of his apartment. Completely

          in shock. As he looks to the plasma... Fox Business on mute.

          Brian Sullivan reporting under the graphic KZI $19.34... -

          $37.28.

          He glares at it for a long moment, then... almost calmly

          picks up a chair and throws it into the tv... which shatters.

          And Jacob... not sure what to do. Until... he turns and

          sees... on the dresser... a gorgeous engagement ring sitting

          in an open box... a fuck you ring.

          EXT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY/CAMPUS - DAY

          As Jacob bounds the steps of the Business School and heads

          into the old stone building.

           18.

          INT. COLUMBIA SCHOOL OF BUSINESS/URIS LECTURE HALL - DAY

          The lecture hall is packed with wall to wall students. Jacob

          stands at the back.

          A PROFESSOR is at the podium.

                          PROFESSOR

           Our speaker today has quite a

           checkered background in the world of

           finance.

          Some laughter from the room.

                          PROFESSOR (CONT'D)

           He graduated from City College in 1966

           and became a securities broker at

           Hudson River Bank then moved on to

           Smith Barney. In 1973 he went out on

           his own to establish a spectacular

           career as a independent trader then an

           active participant in the LBO craze of

           the 1980s.

                          (BEAT)

           In 1988, he was indicted for insider

           trading and then charged with other

           various forms of securities fraud and

           IRS violations. In one of the most

           harshest sentences ever given to a

           white collar criminal... he served

           fourteen years in a maximum security

           prison and he wants me to stress that

           it was not a country club.

          Again laughter from the floor.

                          PROFESSOR (CONT'D)

           Since his release in 2002, he has

           written and has spoken publicly about

           what he refers to as the current state

           of the world economy. He is not

           allowed to trade on the US exchanges.

           His new book "Moral Hazard! Why Wall

           Street Has Finally Gone Too Far."

           comes out in October.

                          (BEAT)

           Please welcome... Gordon Gekko!

          The room applauds... and out to the podium slowly walks...

                         GORDON GEKKO

          No swagger in his step... not in a suit... hair not slicked

          back... but still looks fucking good.

          As he waits for the applause to wind down... and even a

          little longer... surveying every corner of the large room...

          commanding its full attention... getting it... holding the

          silence... until finally... he leans into the mic and says...

           19.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           You're all pretty much fucked.

          The room breaks into laughter... Gordon smiles and waits for

          it to die down.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           What's not funny is what's happening

           out there. I don't think people get

           it. And I know the financial center

           of the world doesn't get it... which

           happens to be Washington DC now.

          As he takes to a pace...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           To understand where we are, we need to

           understand how we got here. No good

           deed goes unpunished, all fires start

           with a well meaning spark and we

           wanted Americans to be able to afford

           homes. Sounds nice enough... lets try

           to get the middle and lower classes

           into homes they can own. So we made

           money cheap and lowered restrictions

           on mortgage lending.

          As he takes a moment and looks over the room...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           Somebody reminded me the other night

           that I once said "greed is good." I

           swear I don't remember it but it

           sounds like something I would say in

           the Eighties.

                          (BEAT)

           And I was right then. Greed was good.

           America needed greed and risk-taking

           and leverage to get to become the

           superpower we are... or were. And

           capitalism needed greed and risk and

           leverage to become the economic

           platform it has become... but those

           same attributes that got us there are

           now the liabilities that threaten to

           destroy us.

          Jacob's blackberry vibrates and he checks it. He has a text.

          "KZI!!! -- wtf?"

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           So greed has been redefined. Who

           knows -- maybe it was always like this

           and like everything else in this

           world, it's good and it is evil.

          Taking a moment to survey the room...

           20.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           Because people -- it's greed that

           caused someone who aspires to own a

           seven-hundred thousand dollar house

           they can't afford, to take on a loan

           they'll never be able to pay back...

           and it's greed that caused their

           mortgage lender to give them that loan

           then sell it right away... and it's

           greed that caused the buyer of that

           loan to slice it into a million little

           pieces then spit them all over the

           world... and it's greed that caused

           the rating agency to give that toxic

           loan a triple-A rating just because it

           was mixed in with some good loans...

           and it's greed that caused the

           insurance company to insure that loan.

          Jacob quickly glances down again at his blackberry and checks

          the quote, KZI $14.53.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           They were insuring the end of the

           world; "When the world explodes...

           just find us in the rubble and we'll

           be sure to pay your claim."

          Drawing in a deep breath...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           CMO's, CLO's, CBO's, CDO's, CDS's,

           SPE's, ABCP's,SIV's, REMIC's, CMBS's,

           toxic traunches, ninja loans, credit

           default swaps, affinity marketing,

           stapled financing, synthetic

           securitization.

                          (BEAT)

           Maybe I was in prison too long but I

           have no idea what half that shit

           means.

          The room laughs in agreement.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           And I'm considered a pretty smart guy

           when it comes to finance!

          And Jacob's blackberry vibrates again. This time he removes

          it from his pocket, doesn't check it and simply turns it off.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           And if I know our central bank --

           which I do -- I predict it's going to

           throw gasoline on this fire with more

           cheap money and federal bailouts and

                          HEAD-IN-THE-SAND MANIPULATED

           statistics on productivity and

           inflation.

          And Gordon stops pacing... takes a moment for effect.

           21.

          Then sums it all up with...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           So no good deed goes unpunished and

           all fires start with a well-meaning

           spark and when you take free money and

           no lending standards then add it with

           unaccountable risk and ungodly

           leverage and unbridled greed... what

           you end up with is cancer.

          And Gordon takes in a deep breath...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           Systemic, malignant and global.

          Now the room is completely silent.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           Do they still have the V&T restaurant

           on Amsterdam? Is that still there?

          A stunned girl in the front row shakes her head.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           (with a smile)

           God, I loved their pizza.

          INT. URIS HALLWAY - DAY

          Jacob looks on as Gordon is surrounded by professors and

          students alike...

                          GORDON GEKKO

           (announcing to the throng)

           I'll give you six minutes then I

           really have to go.

          EXT. URIS HALL - EXACTLY 6 MINUTES LATER

          Gordon quickly walks out with his PUBLISHER, a woman in her

          40s and heads into the quad. Jacob immediately matches their

          stride.

                          JACOB

           Mr. Gekko, can I speak to you for a

           moment?

          As he keeps walking...

                          GORDON GEKKO

           You're too late, Sport... Q&A's over.

                          JACOB

           My name is Jacob Moore and I'm dating

           your daughter.

                          (AND THEN)

           I'm going to ask her to marry me.

          And this makes Gordon stop and finally face Jacob with...

           22.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           I'll give you nine minutes.

          EXT. 112TH STREET - MOMENTS LATER

          As Gordon and Jacob leave the campus and take to the street.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Keller, Zabel? Then you have my

           apologies.

                          JACOB

           Yeah...

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Stock's in a free fall. My guess is

           that it just lost its Bar Mitzvah...

          Jacob quickly takes out his blackberry, turns it on and

          checks to see Gordon's right... KZI... $12.54.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           By the end of the day it might not

           even be potty trained.

          And Jacob looks at him.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           I might not be allowed to trade, Jake,

           but I still love to watch from home.

                          JACOB

           Andrew Zabel took me under his wing

           when I was in high school. He

           basically got me my scholarship to

           Yale then hired me right out of

           business school.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Andrew's smart, he beats the

           benchmarks consistently. He'll land

           on his feet.

                          JACOB

           He's dead.

          And Gordon stops walking and regards Jacob. Who confirms...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           He killed himself this morning.

          As that registers...

                          GORDON GEKKO

           I'm sorry to hear that.

                          JACOB

           He was a father to me.

           23.

          And Jacob coldly shakes it off then sucks in a deep breath

          and looks into Gordon's eyes... genuine and lofty...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           I love your daughter very much and I

           would be honored if...

          And realizing what this is... Gordon starts to laugh... which

          throws Jacob off.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           ... you would bless-- I really don't

           understand what you find so funny.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           My daughter hasn't spoken to me for

           eleven years and you know it. She

           blames me for her brother's overdose

           and every other disaster that's fallen

           upon the world since the mid-nineties.

                          (BEAT)

           And by the way, isn't it strange that

           Winnie would date a guy from the

           street?

                          JACOB

           What?

                          GORDON GEKKO

           She hates me. And she hates Wall

           Street and everything it represents...

           so don't you find it curious that she

           would fall in love with you?

          And that slams into Jacob... who's frozen for a beat.

          Jacob finally snaps out of it then joins Gordon.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           So you want my blessing?

                          JACOB

           Yes.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           I guess I should know a little about

           you first. Where did you grow up?

                          JACOB

           Matinecock.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           I'm impressed.

                          JACOB

           It wasn't like that. I mean we didn't

           have much money. My mother was a

           tailor.

           24.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           And your father... what did he do?

                          JACOB

           Disappear.

          And Gordon regards Jacob for a long moment, taking him in,

          until...

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Clever.

          Jacob looks down the street.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           What are you looking for?

                          JACOB

           Your town car.

          With a laugh...

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Well, pal...

          As Gordon pats Jacob on the back...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           ... then you're going to be looking

           for quite awhile.

          ... and heads for the subway.

          INT. 110TH STREET SUBWAY STATION - DAY

          Gordon takes out his wallet and produces his metrocard.

          Jacob notices a picture of Winnie in the wallet.

                          JACOB

                          (RE PICTURE)

           Can I see that?

          Gordon shrugs and shows the picture to Jacob.

          It's of a young Winnie and younger Gordon on the back of a

          gorgeous white horse.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           She was eight in that one. It was

           taken in Egypt.

                          JACOB

           Can I... have it?

                          (EXPLAINING)

           She doesn't keep pictures from her

           childhood.

          Gordon slowly nods.

           25.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           What do I get in return?

                          JACOB

           You... wanna make a trade?

          And Gordon thinks about, then...

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Yes. I'll give you this picture and

           in return... I'd like a picture of

           Winnie... taken recently... without

           you in it.

                          JACOB

           I don't have one on me.

          Gordon sighs, takes the picture out of his wallet and hands

          it to Jacob.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Then I'll give you this one on margin.

                         PLATFORM

          As they wait for the train...

          Jacob produces the ring box and opens it to show Gordon the

          ring.

                          JACOB

           I really did come to ask for your

           blessing.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           No, you didn't. Nice ring...

          As the train arrives...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           It's so typical.

           (inside of an ironic laugh)

           Levered to the hilt... and with the

           ship going down...

          As he gets on...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           ... they still gave you a bonus.

          INT. THE DOWNTOWN 3 TRAIN - DAY

          Gordon stares at a one sheet advertisement on the wall.

          And he doesn't look at Jacob when he says...

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Don't play me, Jake. You don't think

           I can see it in your eyes? You don't

           think I know that look?

                          (BEAT)

                          (MORE)

           26.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           I know it by sight, Kid... because I

           lived it for years. Christ, I can

           even smell it on you.

                          JACOB

           Smell what on me?

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Revenge.

          Jacob just looks away.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           Some hedgehog said bad things about

           your company. It caused the stock to

           plummet and made those bad things

           become true.

          And Jacob now sees the poster that has Gordon's attention.

          It features a pile of money being blown out the window under

          the caption that reads... "If this looks familiar to you...

          it's because you're renting!"

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           The man you loved like a father threw

           himself in front of the uptown five

           this morning and you want to bring

           that hedgehog to their knees.

                          JACOB

           You knew he was dead?

          "Guardian Mortgage... Low down payments... Adjustable rates."

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Like I said -- I still love to watch

           from home.

          And now Gordon turns to face Jacob with...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           So don't insult me by pretending to

           ask for Winnifred's hand when what you

           really want to know is who to bring

           down to their knees and how to do it.

          And Jacob swallows that back... doesn't argue it.

                          JACOB

           I know who.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Really?

                          JACOB

           It was either Nassim Tariq from the

           Frontier Fund, Bretton Woods from

           Locust or Karen Molina from ESL.

           27.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Does Winnie even know you came to see

           me?

                          JACOB

           Well, not exactly.

                          (THEN)

           But I'm going to tell her.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Not such a grand idea, Pal.

          Off Jacob's confusion...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           See, I have a feeling you're going to

           want to see me again. And if you tell

           her we had this little pow-wow...

           she's not going to let that happen.

          As Jacob considers that... the train slows to a stop.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           Look, you seem like a smart kid.

                          (BEAT)

           Walk away, dust off your resume and

           get another job...

          As he steals one last glance at that Guardian Mortgage ad...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           ... but do it quick.

          And with that, Gordon moves for the doors.

          But Jacob steps in front of him.

                          JACOB

           I'm going to bring them down. Whoever

           floated the rumor for a quick buck.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           It's not worth it. It's a waste of

           energy and time. See, Jacob, nobody

           gets it... they never did.

          As the subway doors open...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           If there's one thing I learned in

           prison it's that money is not the

           prime commodity in our lives... time

           is.

                          (BEAT)

           And your nine minutes are up.

          And Gordon Gekko gets off the subway... leaving Jacob on the

          train. But right before the doors close, Gordon stops and

          turns with...

           28.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           There are worse ways to go than

           jumping in front of a train. For

           instance, could you imagine taking

           something for your diabetes...

          As the doors close...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           .. and end up having it cause you to

           die of acute pancreatitis?

          And as the subway pulls out of the station, Jacob Moore just

          stands there... holding the pole and wondering what the hell

          that was supposed to mean.

          EXT. ANDREW ZABEL'S MATINECOCK, LONG ISLAND HOME - DAY

          A Victorian Estate on a bluff. Zabel's funeral in progress.

          Hundreds of people made it out from the city. All types.

                          PRIEST

           Andrew didn't have children, so he

           made all you -- all of us -- his

           children.

                          (BEAT)

           And to list Andrew Zabel's many

           accomplishments would take me far too

           long to enumerate, but if you just

           look around you, you'll see those

           accomplishments in the faces of the

           many people gathered here today.

          And we pan the procession of mourners... past...

                          PRIEST (CONT'D)

           The alumni of the Morris High School

           class of 1997... who -- through the

           pledged to pay the college educations

           of every member who graduated and got

           accepted into a University.

          ... past...

                          PRIEST (CONT'D)

           The members of the Saint Helena

           Symphony, who Andrew provided

           emergency funding for when they were

           facing extinction.

                          (BEAT)

           And the many, many, other recipients

           of Andrew Zabel's generosity.

          ... and past...

                          PRIEST (CONT'D)

           Those who were left behind... those

           who were overlooked... those who

           otherwise would never have stood a

           chance.

           29.

          And we land on Jacob L. Moore...

           PRIEST (CONT'D)(O.S)

           Above being just a great financial

           mind... or a great husband...

          He wears a dark suit... and a blank expression...

           PRIEST (CONT'D) (O.S.)

           ... or a great father... or a great

           neighbor... or a great friend...

          ... with nothing but cold retribution in his eyes.

           PRIEST (CONT'D) (O.S.)

           ... Andrew Zabel was a great man.

          INT. POOL HOUSE - DAY

          Most of the guests across the pool eat and quietly mill about.

          We're with Jacob, Willy, Audry and another trader named

          DANIEL.

                          AUDRY

           Two dollars a share?

                          WILLY

           The Fed didn't give us a choice.

          Jacob walks around the room... taking in the pictures of

          Andrew Zabel's life...

                          AUDRY

           Does that include the building?

                          DANIEL

           What about the Zabel's institutional

           managed fund? How much is in that?

                          WILLY

           Eight billion.

                          AUDRY

           And that's all intact.

                          DANIEL

           Jesus, United Bancorp made out like a

           bandit.

                          WILLY

           We could've handled it at $60 a share

           or even $50.

          He just shakes his head...

                          WILLY (CONT'D)

           It was that fucking rumor. It was so

           well timed. And the market doesn't

           care... shoot first, ask later.

           30.

                          DANIEL

           Lemmings.

                          AUDRY

                          (OMINOUSLY)

           United has a huge trading desk.

                          DANIEL

           Yeah, we're all out of a job.

          Jacob pulls away from the wall of pictures...

                          JACOB

           My mother was a tailor.

          They all look at him.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           Out of our house less than five miles

           from here.

                          AUDRY

           You're from Matinecock? I thought you

           didn't grow up with mon--

          Jacob confirms...

                          JACOB

           We weren't rich. Everyone else was.

                          (BEAT)

           She altered their clothes and I

           carried their golf clubs.

          And Jacob looks at a picture of Andrew Zabel one more time...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           He gave me a seat at the table.

          ... and goes.

          EXT. ANDREW ZABEL'S HOME - DAY

          Jacob heads for the main house. He sees BARBARA ZABEL,

          Andrew's wife, sitting next to the some friends.

          Jacob slowly walks over and when she sees him... she

          stands... wobbly and full of tears.

                          BARBARA

           Jacob...

          Jacob takes her into his embrace...

                          BARBARA (CONT'D)

           (through her sobs)

           You were a son to him...

          Squeezing her tight... fighting back a rush of emotion.

           31.

                          JACOB

           I was a fucked up kid, I was angry, my

           mother couldn't control me. He was

           the only one who cared. I wouldn't be

           anywhere right now if it wasn't for...

          And Jacob Moore stops short... finally breaking down...

          allowing his own tears to stream down his face.

          He pulls away...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           If you need anything.

          She nods.

          And Jacob moves away from the people and moves across the

          lawn. But he stops when he sees a woman standing across the

          way... we've seen pictures of her.

          She's in her late-twenties with a natural beauty that might

          take two glances to notice. But after that second glance...

          it's unforgettable. She's WINNIE GEKKO.

          As she rushes to him...

                          WINNIE

           Jacob, I'm so sorry.

                          (BEAT)

           Why didn't you tell me?

                          JACOB

           Lehigh had the committee hearings and

           I knew he would need you and I didn't

                          WANT TO--

                          WINNIE

           That's not how this works.

          And she looks into his eyes.

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)

           Jacob, that's not how this works.

          He nods. Regards her for a beat, then...

                          JACOB

           Will you marry me?

                          WINNIE

           What?

                          JACOB

           I got a ring. Not on me, but--

                          WINNIE

           Are you proposing to me at a funeral?

                          JACOB

           Yeah.

           32.

          And then...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           I had a whole thing I was going to do

           in DC but seeing you... the words just

           kind of fell out of my mouth... I

           don't know.

                          WINNIE

           He would've loved you doing this here.

          Jacob agrees. And she softly kisses him and squeezes him

          tight... tears in her eyes.

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)

           Yes... I'll marry you, Jacob.

          Hugging her back.

                          JACOB

           By the way, I don't have a job

           anymore.

                          WINNIE

           Awesome.

          AND THAT FUCK YOU RING

          Glittering in all its glory. Pull back to be in...

                         JACOB'S APARTMENT

          Winnie looks up from the ring.

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)

           It's beautiful.

                          JACOB

           Yeah...

                          WINNIE

           It's too expensive. We'll return it.

                          JACOB

           No.

                          WINNIE

           Jacob I don't care about what ring you

           give me. You know that.

                          JACOB

           We're not taking it back. I worked

           hard for that ring and I want you to

           wear it.

          She regards him... he's serious.

                          WINNIE

           Okay.

           33.

          He moves to her... takes the ring and places it on her

          finger.

          Then Jacob pulls her into his kiss... it's almost violent.

          She's taken off guard.

          And as they fall into each other then back onto the bed...

          INT. KELLER, ZABEL INVESTMENTS/TRADING FLOOR - DAY

          The whole floor is dead. The tvs are off.

          Jacob cleans out his desk, Audry cleans hers out as well

          across the way.

          Jacob wipes his forehead and glances up at the large letters

          on the wall "Keller, Zabel Investments."

          And he shakes his head in anger and frustration...

                          JACOB

           Hey Audry.

          She looks up.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           You cover pharm and biotech.

                          AUDRY

           I did.

                          JACOB

           Who are the big players in diabetes

           treatments?

                          AUDRY

           Lilly, Abbot, OSI, Inverness.

                          JACOB

           Is anyone riding on something in phase

           three?

                          AUDRY

           Few midcaps maybe. You want me to

           check?

          He nods. She turns on her computer and takes a seat.

                          AUDRY (CONT'D)

           Oh, this takes me back to when I had a

           job...

          He stands over her shoulder.

                          AUDRY (CONT'D)

           Yeah, Amlyn pharmaceuticals has Byetta

           going in front of the FDA next month.

           I remember this...

                          (MORE)

           34.

                          AUDRY (CONT'D)

           they pulled it during phase two

           because some of the test subjects died

           but they've obviously solved those

           problems now.

                          JACOB

           How did they die?

                          AUDRY

           I don't remember.

                          JACOB

           Pancreatitis?

                          AUDRY

           Yeah. That was it.

          Jacob shakes his head...

                          JACOB

           How did he know?

                          AUDRY

           Who?

          Without answering her...

                          JACOB

           Can you look up large institutional

           ownership?

                          AUDRY

           Mutual or hedge?

                          JACOB

           Hedge.

                          AUDRY

           Locust Fund owns a shitload.

          And she looks over to Jacob with...

                          AUDRY (CONT'D)

           Bretton Woods.

          As he takes in that information...

                          JACOB

           Want your severance, Audry?

          And he kisses her on the forehead...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           Short Amlyn pharmaceuticals.

          ... and goes.

           A doctor that's very close to the

           trials... and that's all I can say.

                         CHRISTIES

          As they move on from the Polke...

           36.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           But listen, I'm out of work now so I

           can't afford to get behind size on

           this trade... I'm only telling you

           because you've helped me in the past.

                         EVOLUTION STUDIOS

          As he removes his head gear and wipes away the sweat.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           This is completely off the record. So

           please...

                         LOFT

          As they receive the next glass of wine...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           ... don't tell anyone.

          EXT. UNION STATION WASHINGTON DC - NIGHT

          Jacob gets off the train and sees her across the platform...

          Winnie.

          And as he brings her into his embrace...

          INT. WASHINGTON DC/15 RIA RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Jacob and Winnie have dinner with her boss, SENATOR KATHERINE

          LEHIGH, 50's.

                          JACOB

           Your boy's coming up in the polls.

          Senator Lehigh nods.

                          SENATOR LEHIGH

           They're blaming this mess on the

           current administration... it's helping

           us. And some people say that the

           worst isn't over.

                          JACOB

           Her father. What's the word he

           uses... systemic.

          Winnie looks over to Jacob.

                          WINNIE

           When did he say that?

          And Jacob takes for an extra long moment... holding her

          look... then comes to a decision and lies...

                          JACOB

           On Charlie Rose.

           37.

          But Winnie continues to glare at him... until...

                          SENATOR LEHIGH

           (with a smile)

           Okay -- so when's the big date?

          EXT. MANHATTAN - MONDAY MORNING

          As New York opens for business...

          INT. STREETACCOUNT.COM OFFICES - MORNING

          The prevalent pay site for all hedgefunders, trading desk

          cowboys and large individual players. Looks like a scrappy

          internet start-up with mismatching cheap office furniture.

          As our blogger from the gym sips his coffee, fires up his

          computer and starts to type...

          INT. WINNIE'S APARTMENT/WASHINGTON DC - MORNING

          A small well appointed two-bedroom in Cleveland Heights.

          Jacob wakes and leans up. He regards Winnie sleeping next to

          him. He softly kisses her neck. She smiles in her sleep

          then rolls over.

          As their bodies intertwine...

          INT. THE CAPITAL FUND/NEW YORK OFFICES - MORNING

          A huge industrial space in the highline district that houses

          this eight billion dollar hedge fund.

          Find a meeting in progress with all of the fund PORTFOLIO

          MANAGERS. This is known as the weekly idea storm session...

          where each PM pitches new trade ideas.

          As Hedge Fund PM stands up to present to the team with a

          confident smile...

          INT. WINNIE'S APARTMENT/WASHINGTON DC - MORNING

          Dressed for work, Winnie heads into the bedroom and regards

          Jacob still laying in bed.

          She kisses him on the forehead, lays a section of The

          Washington Post on his chest with a little laugh then goes.

          As Jacob looks down to see... it's the classified jobs

          section.

          INT. MORGAN STANLEY/PRIVATE CLIENT GROUP OFFICES - MORNING

          Midtown, corporate, high-floor.

          Find the private client portfolio manager we remember from

          the wine tasting.

           38.

          He sits at his computer in a big corner office with a

          beautiful western view to the river behind him and types in

          an IM window "AMLN short -- FDA to deny Byetta" then hits

          send.

          As he receives the digital receipt... "1209 instant messages

          sent."

          INT. WINNIE'S APARTMENT/WASHINGTON DC - MORNING

          As Jacob munches toast and watches Fox Business in his

          underwear...

           JENNA LEE (ON TV)

           ... another stock that's getting

           beaten before the bell is Amlyn

           Pharmaceuticals. The stock's down

           nine percent in premarket trading on

           no news.

          Jacob smiles.

           JENNA LEE (ON TV) (CONT'D)

           When we come back we have Blue star

           Airlines' CEO Bud Fox discussing how

           he turned his once small regional

           airline into the country's third

           largest carrier.

          INT. AMLYN PHARMACEUTICALS/PRESS ROOM - DAY

          A select group of Financial JOURNALISTS sit in small metal

          chairs in front of a podium with the Amlyn name and logo

          behind it.

          As the INVESTOR RELATIONS OFFICER heads up the podium and

          opens his prepared statement...

          INT. WINNIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Jacob watches "Happy Hour" on Fox Business as Winnie opens a

          bottle of wine in the kitchen. She pours a glass of wine and

          another of water.

                          WINNIE

           If he wins... she has a real chance

           for a cabinet position and I'm pretty

           sure she'll take me with her if she

           can.

                          JACOB

           He's going to win.

          As she hands him the glass of water...

                          WINNIE

           Don't jinx it.

          And Jacob sees Amlyn Pharmaceuticals graphic on the screen

          and turns up the tv.

           39.

           ERIC BOLLING (ON THE TV)

           Big drop in Amlyn as negative rumors

           on the street forced the company to

           admit there are still internal

           concerns about Byetta and

           pancreatitis. They now may be forced

           to pull the phase three drug from FDA

           review and retool.

                          (BEAT)

           The stock takes a twenty-eight percent

           haircut.

                          WINNIE

           Can we watch something else?

          Jacob brings her in and kisses her...

                          JACOB

           Whatever you want.

          Her phone rings. As she goes to answer it...

                          WINNIE

                          (KIDDING)

           Project Runway.

                          JACOB

           Not Project Runway.

          Picking up the phone...

                          WINNIE

           Hello... who is this? Hold on.

          As she pulls the phone away from her ear and looks over to

          Jacob...

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)

           It's for you... someone named Bretton

           Woods?

          EXT. 15 CENTRAL PARK WEST - NIGHT

          Jacob rounds West 62nd street and stares down the hottest new

          address in Manhattan. A little nervous, he sucks in a deep

          breath then heads into the building.

          INT. 15 CENTRAL PARK WEST/ PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

          A BUTLER lets Jacob in. Jacob takes in the massive space

          with an insane view of Central Park. He can hear a beautiful

          sonata playing in the next room.

                          JACOB

           I'm here to see Bretton Woods.

          The butler nods then leads Jacob through the full floor unit

          and into the...

                         PARLOR

           40.

          A huge chandelier hangs over the all marble room. A

          fireplace on one wall and a twelve foot wall of glass

          featuring that park view on the other.

          And Jacob realizes that sonata is live. He's walked into a

          recital of some sort.

          About twenty people sit watching a YOUNG GIRL play on a very

          unique looking silver grand piano.

          The girl can't be a day over thirteen. She's playing

          Mozart's "Ronda Alla Turca"... her fingers gliding across the

          keyboard in precision, her eyes closed in inspiration. It's

          as spectacular as it is moving.

          Jacob takes it in for a moment then looks over the room. All

          ethnicities and types...

          The AFRICAN LEADER in full tribal gear, the DISHEVELED ARTIST

          with his GAY NOVELIST LOVER, the NEW YORK KNICK with his

          MODEL WIFE, the MOVIE STAR with her TEENAGE SON.

          And BRETTON WOODS...

          Mid 40s, slicing jawline, deep set eyes, in great shape,

          refined, composed and masculine.

          He's the owner of this penthouse and he's looking right at

          Jacob. Jacob looks away.

          And the young girl finishes the last movement of the sonata

          to applause.

          The guests all stand, some go talk with the girl. Bretton

          heads over to Jacob.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           As you can see, I'm having a little

           dinner party here but I thought it was

           important we speak right away.

          He speaks with a British accent.. Jacob nods.

          Bretton looks over the room for a moment, scans his guests

          then back at Jacob...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           Please... if you don't mind waiting in

           my office, I'll be in a minute.

          And the butler is already at Jacob's side, motioning him to

          follow him.

          INT. BRETTON WOODS'S OFFICE - NIGHT

          Jacob waits for Bretton. He looks over the place. The view

          of the park. The classic furniture.

          AND THE HUGE PAINTING ON THE WALL

           41.

          Of a giant man-like monster eating a much smaller naked

          human. The smaller man's head's been bitten off and blood

          drips down the body.

          Jacob holds on the painting.

           BRETTON WOODS (O.S.)

           Saturno devorando a sus hijos.

          As Jacob turns to see Bretton standing in the doorway.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           Saturn devouring his son. Francisco

           Goya.

          Bretton heads in and closes the door behind him.

                          JACOB

           Do you collect?

                          BRETTON WOODS

           No.

          Sitting behind his desk...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           Only the obsessive compulsive or the

           insecure egotistical feel the need to

           collect things.

          Jacob nods. Bretton just looks at him... making him nervous.

                          JACOB

           Your daughter's an amazing piano

           player. That was quite a show.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           That wasn't my daughter. That was

           Isabel Patrovsky, she's the world's

           greatest living piano prodigy.

                          (BEAT)

           And that wasn't a show... that was a

           very expensive private recital.

          There's a long beat of silence with Jacob just looking at

          Bretton... taking him in.

          And it's unmistakable -- the one thing that this man exudes

          above all else... is composure.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           You cost my fund three hundred and

           forty million dollars today.

          Off of Jacob's slight smile...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           Yeah, kills my year, pushes my

           watermark higher and might cause

           redemptions.

                          (MORE)

           42.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

                          (BEAT)

           I hope you're happy. My fund's in

           trouble now.

          Jacob just shrugs.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           You don't want to deny it?

                          JACOB

           No.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           Who told you?

                          JACOB

           A doctor I know.

          Bretton nods... regards him.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           I checked with all the desks in

           town... you didn't make money off it.

                          JACOB

           That's right.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           Then why did you do it?

                          JACOB

           You destroyed my firm.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           Your firm destroyed itself.

                          JACOB

           You killed Andrew Zabel.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           Andrew Zabel killed himself.

          And Bretton sighs...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           The rumors were true.

                          JACOB

           You made them true.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           No, Jacob, being levered thirty-eight

           to one in toxic debt made them true.

                          (BEAT)

           Institutional money-running was

           Zabel's talent... he didn't have a

           down year in the last twenty.

          Jacob just glares at him.

           43.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           His fatal flaw was allowing the

           children on his mortgage security desk

           to talk him into the deadly game of

           hot potato everybody's been so fond of

           playing recently.

          And Jacob holds Bretton's look for a moment, then... heads

          for the door without saying a thing...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           Come work for me.

          Jacob stops and turns...

                          JACOB

           What?

                          BRETTON WOODS

           I run three billion dollars. Come

           help me run it.

          And Jacob takes a beat... processing this...

                          JACOB

           Why me?

                          BRETTON WOODS

           Because your loyalty desired revenge,

           your balls actually attempted it and

           your skills pulled it off.

          As he stands...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           And as for Andrew Zabel... there

           really is no telling why he did what

           he did.

                          (BEAT)

           As far as I'm concerned, it was just a

           bit of money... and there are surely

           more important things in the world.

          And Jacob sucks in a deep breath -- containing his anger.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           Now I'm going on Safari with my

           family. Think about the offer and get

           in touch after the July 4th holiday.

          ... heading for the door...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           You got my attention, Jacob... and

           that's one of the rarest commodities

           out there.

          And Jacob just regards him, then...

           44.

                          JACOB

           You can have my answer now, Bretton...

           I have no interest in working for a

           fund that's in trouble.

          Bretton smiles...

                          BRETTON WOODS

           Touche.

          Jacob nods... holding Bretton's look. Then...

                          JACOB

           What's your number?

                          BRETTON WOODS

           Excuse me?

                          JACOB

           The amount of money you would need to

           be able to walk away from it all and

           just live happily-ever-after.

                          (BEAT)

           Everybody has one -- it's an exact

           number -- what's yours?

          And Bretton takes a moment to think about that, then simply

          says...

                          BRETTON WOODS

           More.

          ... and disappears into his penthouse.

          EXT. 533 THIRD AVENUE - MORNING

          Jacob heads out of his building to be greeted by...

                          DIEGO

           You know what I overheard a guy say

           yesterday?

                          JACOB

           I know you're going to tell me...

          Diego smiles...

                          DIEGO

           "This market's just like a divorce.

           I've lost half my money... only I

           still have my wife!"

          As he goes into the hot summer day...

                          JACOB

           Not bad...

           45.

          EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE/ATLANTIC GRILL - DAY

          Jacob heads up to the restaurant to find Gordon Gekko waiting

          outside.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           There's a wait.

                          JACOB

           Oh...

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Fifteen minutes she said.

                          JACOB

           Okay.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           No, that's not okay. Because it means

           they're crowded so every tier in the

           service chain will be extended. The

           sixteen minutes we would normally wait

           to order will now be twenty six, the

           standard twenty four minutes waiting

           for our food to arrive will turn into

           thirty nine, the eight minutes to get

           the check will become seventeen and

           the four minutes to process the credit

           card will take nine.

                          (BEAT)

           I told you I'd have lunch with you...

           not give you a hundred and six minutes

           of my time.

          Jacob just stands there.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           Let's go to Whole Foods.

          INT. WHOLE FOODS - DAY

          Gordon and Jacob share a little table out front of the market.

          Gordon enjoys a turkey burger from the deli while Jacob doesn't

          eat.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Did you eat before?

                          JACOB

           Just not hungry.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Yeah... I used to not eat lunch too.

          Jacob nods and slides something across the table. The

          picture of Winnie in workout gear, flipping the finger.

          Gordon looks at it and laughs.

           46.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           Fitting.

          As he places it in his pocket...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           That'll make it a round trade for us.

                          JACOB

           I actually owe you one now.

          Off Gordon's look...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           I crushed him.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Did you?

                          JACOB

           His fund is bleeding. I wouldn't be

           surprised if the redemptions finish

           the job.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Well, Chief... you seem awfully proud

           of yourself.

                          JACOB

           How'd you know about Amlyn?

          Gordon shrugs.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           It's amazing what information you can

           find out when people know you're not

           going to trade on it.

                          JACOB

           So, you didn't use me to make a little

           money?

          And never to look up from his lunch...

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Naw. I prefer to write about the

           action now than be apart of it.

                          JACOB

           Why'd you give it to me?

                          GORDON GEKKO

           You're out of a job and most likely

           going to marry my daughter... I

           figured you could use the money.

                          JACOB

           I didn't make any money off of it.

           47.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           You didn't trade it?

          With a smile in and over-the-top faux innocence.

                          JACOB

           That would've been insider trading,

           Mr. Gekko.

          Gordon just shakes his head.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           And not "most likely."

                          (BEAT)

           Winnie and I are engaged.

          As Gordon finally looks up from his burger... impressed.

          EXT. PARK AVENUE - DAY

          As they walk up Park Avenue...

                          GORDON GEKKO

           So did you take my advice and not tell

           your new fiance about our little

           friendship.

          Jacob doesn't say anything. And Gordon doesn't press.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           So, I'm guessing she's not going to

           take your last name.

                          JACOB

           Good guess.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           That's my Winnie. I knew she was a

           feminist when she was five and furious

           that Mrs. Claus didn't get enough

           credit.

          And this makes Jacob smile... then...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           My brother has two daughters. I had

           Winnie and Rudy.

           (sucking in a deep breath)

           And since Rudy... you know... well,

           I've worried about the name. It's

           something you don't really think about

           until you hit sixty or so but it's

           important.

          As they walk some more in silence, until...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           I want you to get my daughter to

           accept me back into her life again,

           Jacob.

           48.

          Jacob slowly nods... not surprised.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           Because save for the extremely

           precious and depreciating asset of

           time... she's all I have.

          As Gordon stops in front of a Georgian-style, pre-war

          building and turns to Jacob...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           C'mon, I'll show you some more

           pictures of your fiancee that she

           doesn't want you to see.

          INT. 655 PARK AVENUE/ELEVATOR - DAY

          Gordon and Jacob get into the elevator, Gordon pushes "4."

          The doors begin to close but someone gets on at the last

          moment.

          He's a hedge fund type, real SLICK, reminds us of Gekko

          twenty years ago. Oh... and he's about 29 years old.

                          SLICK

           Gordon...

          Gekko nods. Slick hits his floor... "PH."

                          SLICK (CONT'D)

           Sky still falling?

                          GORDON GEKKO

           You know it.

                          SLICK

           (inside of a derisive sigh)

           Sells books I guess.

          INT. GEKKO'S APARTMENT/LIVING ROOM - DAY

          No doubt about it, this is a nice place. Worth three million

          dollars, maybe four at the beginning of the year.

          Sparsely decorated. Large framed photographs line the walls.

          Gordon shows Jacob pictures of Winnie's childhood.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           She refused to take that cowboy hat

           off. She actually slept in it.

          Smitten, Jacob looks at some more of the pictures then

          stands... taking in the large framed pictures on the wall.

          As Jacob checks out a framed chart for "Gouda Tulip Bulbs Dec

          1 1634 to Feb 5 1637." The chart goes straight up and to the

          right then straight down in a single line.

           49.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           Tulip mania... the art of a bubble.

                          JACOB

           Bretton offered to hire me.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           And did you accept?

          As Jacob moves over to an another piece.

                          JACOB

           Fuck no.

          Jacob now finds himself looking at a political cartoon from

          the early 1900s.

          It's of two men rowing a boat in a lake of dollars. One of

          the men is Uncle Sam dressed in US flag colors. But Sam's

          very small in this cartoon... can't really row the boat.

          The other man is much bigger and clearly doing the heavy

          rowing. He is...

                          GORDON GEKKO

           JP Morgan... he single-handedly

           stopped the Panic of 1907 by stepping

           in and buying up shares in all the

           companies that were crashing.

           Everyone else quickly followed like

           lemmings.

           (re political cartoon)

           See -- people had stopped looking to

           their government or trusted advisors.

           They looked to JP Morgan. It was all

           about simple psychology -- every crash

           should have a JP Morgan to step in and

           save it.

          As they walk the hardwood floor...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           See Jacob... the best opportunities

           are found where angels fear to tread.

          And they arrive at the next piece on the wall... a small

          framed bond.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           That's a bond issued by the Central

           American country of Poyais. Gregor

           McGregor made a fortune dealing these

           to the British elite in 1820.

                          (BEAT)

           The country didn't exist.

          And now Jacob notices a very strange picture across the

          room... he goes over to look at it.

           50.

          It's very old... black and white... of a woman filling her

          stove with money.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           Weimer Republic of Germany 1922.

           Inflation turned to hyper-inflation

           and it was more efficient to burn the

           money for heat than spend it.

                          JACOB

           That's horrifying.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           I know.

          As they both hold on the picture...

                          JACOB

           What caused it?

                          GORDON GEKKO

           A country in debt... that took on even

           more debt to fund a war... then

           printed mountains of money to avoid a

           depression and other financial

           imbalances...

          As he turns to face Jacob...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           ... sound familiar?

                          JACOB

           And you honestly think this is where

           we're heading?

          Looking Jacob head on... deadly serious...

                          GORDON GEKKO

           If we don't take our heads out of the

           sand... yes. It's going to get bad

           out there, Champ, I'm not going to

           lie. Even the small regional bank I

           started out at might go under.

                          JACOB

           Hudson River Bank...

                          GORDON GEKKO

           That's right.

          And then...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           And I've got some news for you... he

           ain't bleeding. He's not even cut.

                          JACOB

           What are you talking about?

           51.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           What I'm talking about, Jake... is

           that I'd bet dollars to donuts that

           Bretton Woods unwound most of his

           position in Amlyn last week. That he

           knew about the pancreatitis.

          Off of Jacob's confusion...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           The only reason you think you hurt him

           is because he wanted you to think

           that.

                          JACOB

           How do you know that?

                          GORDON GEKKO

           I don't. But it's not Bretton's first

           rodeo... and my instincts for this

           sort of thing don't often disappoint.

          Jacob can't believe it. And with each passing moment of

          realization... shock turns into rage.

                          JACOB

           I can't believe it.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Believe it, Princess... he's beating

           your ass all over the court.

          As Jacob tries to calm himself.

                          JACOB

           And you think I should take the job --

           bring him down from the inside?

          Gordon confirms that with a simple shake of the head and...

                          GORDON GEKKO

           I don't know, Jake... what you kids

           think is pay-back these days is really

           incredible. When I was coming up, we

           slaughtered men.

                          (BEAT)

           There are guys still working at penny

           ante brokerages in the Poughkeepsie's

           of this country because they crossed

           me.

          While Jacob processes that...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           So I'll make you another trade, Jake.

           I'll help you bring him down, if you

           help me get her back.

          As Jacob just looks away... non committal.

           52.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           ... then you both can have a father.

          EXT. PARK AVENUE - NIGHT

          As Jacob walks... on the phone with...

                          ROBBY

           Jacob, I could lose my job.

          ... who holds his sleeping infant in his hands.

                          JACOB

           Robby, I need to know. Now nobody

           moves size in this town without using

           your desk.

                          (BEAT)

           We'll play twenty questions only it'll

           be two questions and all you have to

           do is say "yes or no."

          Capitulating with a sigh...

                          ROBBY

           Fire away...

                          JACOB

           Bretton Woods... The Locust Fund...

           did they make any major moves in the

           last few weeks?

                          ROBBY

           Yes.

                          JACOB

           Was it unloading Amlyn

           pharmaceuticals?

                          ROBBY

                          (NERVOUS)

           Jacob...

                          JACOB

           Robby, I got you the fucking the job!

          And after a long moment.

                          ROBBY

           Yes.

          Jacob stops walking... sucks in a deep breath...

                          JACOB

           I'm sorry to make you do that.

          With that, he disconnects and shakes his head in frustration.

          And after a moment, Jacob sucks in a deep breath then makes

          another call.

           53.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           (into the phone)

           Okay Gordon... you've got yourself a

           trade.

          AND WERE BACK ON THE CHART

          As a circle forms on June 19th then travels down the trend

          line to early July and stops.

          And as a circle is formed around July 4th, we...

                          CUT TO:

                         FIREWORKS

          Exploding over the Capitol building.

          EXT. SENATOR LEHIGH'S GEORGETOWN HOME - NIGHT

          A BBQ for the political set and their families. Paper plates

          and plastic cups are being thrown away by HELP Children and

          parents lay on blankets watching the fireworks.

          Jacob holds Winnie as they look up at the sky...

                          WINNIE

           My parents would always throw this

           huge party in the Hamptons on the

           fourth. The city of South Hampton

           would have its firework show at 8pm

           then my father would wait until it was

           over then put on his... which, of

           course, was always twice as

           spectacular.

          She leans up, sips her wine, then...

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)

           Then one year the city passed an

           ordinance that their firework show had

           to be the last of the night... they

           were sick of getting shown up by

           Gordon Gekko.

          Jacob laughs...

                          JACOB

           What'd he do?

                          WINNIE

           He rented a barge and shot the

           fireworks off of it a mile off the

           coast... out of jurisdiction.

           (then... almost to herself)

           The show was even more amazing over

           the water.

          And Jacob looks at her.

           54.

                          JACOB

           I think he should be invited to the

           wedding.

                          WINNIE

           No.

                          JACOB

           Winnie, he's your father...

          As the fireworks explode into their finale...

                          WINNIE

           You don't know him.

                          JACOB

           I know he's unhappy. Look at him out

           there... trying to scare everybody.

           He's desperate for attention.

                          WINNIE

           This is none of your business.

                          JACOB

           "That's not how this works."

           Remember?

          She just looks away...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           He's got nothing.

          The firework show ends and everyone applauds...

                          WINNIE

           And that's what he deserves.

          Suddenly, everyone begins to look over to the house where

          something is happening...

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)

           The things that came out after he was

           convicted. The affairs... the things

           he was recorded saying...

          SECRET SERVICE PERSONNEL, wearing ear pieces, start walking

          the lawn.

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)

           This wasn't the man we knew, Jacob.

           It was... sociopathic.

          She stands up and looks across the lawn to where all the

          action is.

                          JACOB

           It was a long time ago.

          He stands and kisses her...

           55.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           Just consider it, okay? That's all

           I'm asking.

          She holds his look for a long moment, then... nodding over to

          all the excitement...

                          WINNIE

           C'mon, you can meet the next President

           of the United States.

          INT. THE LOCUST FUND FOYER - DAY

          A massive foyer of black marble with wall to wall views of

          Manhattan. There's much more space than furniture here.

          Jacob waits patiently in a white suede chair... he checks his

          watch and sighs. He's been sitting here quite awhile.

          Finally, the SIX FOOT TALL RECEPTIONIST, leaves her desk...

          her heels clicking as she walks over.

                          SIX FOOT

           Jacob... are you ready?

          Jacob stands and she leads him toward a bank of elevators.

          The doors open and Jacob gets on.

          INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

          Jacob stands there with Six Foot.

                          SIX FOOT

           Do you have everything they said you'd

           need?

          Jacob nods... holding a folder of his previous tax forms, his

          passport and other documents obviously needed for the job.

          And the elevator doors open... but not to an office...

          Jacob shields his eyes to the wash of daylight... then looks

          to realize that he's on the roof of the building.

          And in front of him is... An Augusta A109E Helicopter with

          "The Locust Fund" written on the side.

          INT. AUGUSTA HELICOPTER - DAY

          As Jacob looks down to the city below, wondering where the

          hell they're going...

          EXT. TETERBORO AIRPORT - DAY

          Jacob emerges from the Augusta and looks across the tarmac to

          see a Boeing 727 with "The Locust Fund" written on the side.

          And now Jacob knows why he needed his passport.

           56.

          EXT. LONDON - NIGHT

          As the 727 dives down toward Biggin Hill airfield... the

          lights of London twinkling to the north.

          EXT. CHELSEA - NIGHT

          The Black Maybach limousine pulls up out front of a 19,000-

          square-foot Victorian home with the perfectly restored brick

          exterior.

          As Jacob gets out of the car and sizes down this incredible

          home...

          INT. BRETTON WOODS'S CHELSEA HOME/THE BLACK SWAN HOUSE - NIGHT

          The design is much different that Woods's New York CPW

          penthouse. It's more classical... with dark woods and worn

          leathers and thick rugs and commanding views along the River

          Thames.

          And Jacob is lead into the...

                         DINING ROOM

          Where Bretton eats alone at the head of the long table.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           Jacob.

          As Jacob walks through the expansive space...

                          JACOB

           Mr. Woods.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           (Call me...)

           Bretton.

          ... and sits.

                          JACOB

           Okay... Bretton. I thought we were

           going to meet in New York.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           And I thought you had no interest in

           working for a fund that was in

           trouble.

                          JACOB

           I was emotional. I was angry.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           And what changed?

                          JACOB

           I caught a glance of my portfolio.

           57.

          And Bretton laughs.

          Jacob notices two huge chocolate brown French Mastiffs

          sitting at Bretton's feet.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           Cute dogs.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           Dogue de Bordeaux... bred to kill.

           But Contango and Backwardation here

           are socialized since birth so they're

           harmless.

          Jacob laughs...

                          JACOB

           You named your dogs after technical

           futures market terms?

          And Bretton stands...

                          BRETTON WOODS

           Of course not...

           (with a wink)

           My children did.

          As he heads into...

          THE LIVING ROOM

          A fire burning in the fireplace. Jacob follows Bretton in...

                          JACOB

           And where are your children?

          Bretton moves toward a table with a classic phonograph player

          on it.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           Greece with my wife. My boys are

           studying The Iliad now.

          While Bretton looks through the various sleeves of records,

          Contango and Backwardation slowly find their way into the

          room and sit by the fire.

          Bretton finds what he's looking for... removing the record

          from its sleeve.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           Here it is... one of the most

           beautiful pieces of music you'll ever

           hear.

          Bretton places the record on the phonograph and The Rolling

          Stones "Let It Loose" rings out...

           58.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           "Exile On Main Street," without a

           doubt The Stones greatest album.

          Jacob laughs. He was expecting Beethoven.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           It was all outtakes. Throwaway

           tracks. And the critics hated it.

           And it didn't sell well at first.

                          (BEAT)

           But now it's universally known as

           their best release. I asked Mick once

           how he thought that happened. How

           something could go from so worthless

           to so valuable. He just looked at me

           and said... "it never went from

           worthless to valuable... just the

           opinions of it did."

          Taking a seat...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           And that was the greatest lesson I

           ever learned about investing.

                          JACOB

           An asset's value can only be priced at

           its perception.

                          BRETTON WOODS

                          (IMPRESSED)

           Exactly. There is no intrinsic.

          Then... simply...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           You'll work out of the New York

           office. I wouldn't want to pull you

           away from your fiancee in Washington.

                          JACOB

           Thank you.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           She's Gordon Gekko's daughter.

                          JACOB

           That's right.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           He was a legend at one time. It's

           quite sad how he publicly cries out

           wolf now.

          Bretton stands and stretches.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           You see, for a legend...

           59.

          Inside of a tired sigh...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           ... the only thing worse than death is

           becoming irrelevant.

          And Bretton just sits there... enjoying his scotch while

          taking in the Stones tune...

          INT. LONDON/SAVOY HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

          Jacob stands at the window of his suite... looking out onto

          the Victoria embankment and on the phone with...

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Good work, kid -- you're on the inside

           now.

                          JACOB

           He's going to Dubai to raise some

           money then meeting me in New York to

           set me up.

          Gordon sits at the dining room table at his apartment.

          Papers scattered about and his EDITOR waiting patiently.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           No.

                          JACOB

           What?

                          GORDON GEKKO

           He's not meeting you in New York.

                          JACOB

           Why not?

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Because you need to go to Dubai with

           him.

                          JACOB

           I don't understand.

          EXT. LONDON - DAY

          As the 727 takes off ...

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.)

           You need to do something that will

           earn his trust... you need to make

           yourself a hero...

          INT. 727 - DAY

          Jacob sits across from Bretton who enjoys a slice of Pizza

          and a Coke.

           60.

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.)

           Jacob... you need to help him get this

           money.

          And Jacob glares at Bretton like he might kill him.

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           But be cautious. Your relationship

           with Bretton is still fragile -- you

           fuck it up here and you're done.

          Bretton looks up and Jacob immediately replaces his glare

          with a smile.

                          JACOB

           Looks better than meals I get on

           United.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           John's Pizza on Bleeker. It crossed

           the Atlantic with you yesterday.

           Would you like a slice?

          Jacob declines... then...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           I appreciate you wanting to help with

           this part of the business even though

           it's not your expertise.

                          JACOB

           Well -- there's a lot I can learn from

           you.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           For this trip just stay in the

           background and observe.

          As Bretton tosses some pizza to Contango and Backwardation...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           We're going to meet with Oleg Bakunin.

           He's a Russian oligarch on the run

           because Putin wanted to steal

           everything he owns. He already has a

           few hundred million with us but I'm

           looking to get half a billion more.

           Our maintenance fee on that alone

           would be ten million a year.

                          (BEAT)

           My father didn't make half of that in

           his twenty-six year career.

          And he looks out the window...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           He worked in a mid-level job for

           United Bancorp actually...

           61.

          Never to look from the window... with just a trace of

          disdain...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           Got a fishing kit when he retired.

          EXT. DUBAI/AERIAL VIEW - DAY

          The most bizarre, stunning city in the world -- outlandish

          skyscrapers, marinas, archipelagos...

          And the 727 is now flying over...

          THE WORLD OF ISLANDS

          A collection of man-made islands that make out a one-

          dimensional map-like depiction of Earth.

          As we fly over this archipelago...

           BRETTON WOODS (V.O.)

           Richard Branson purchased Great

           Britain, Rod Stewart bought Germany,

           Tommy Lee bought Greece.

          BECKER JETVAN LUXURY COACH

          It's custom outfitted Mercedes-Benz van that's completely

          decked out like the inside of a private jet. Full

          entertainment system, recessed LED lighting, tray tables,

          fine leather, blacked out windows that "defog" with the push

          of a button, designed by Phillipe Starck and made custom for

          $450,000 (once you get to the top of the waiting list.)

          Jacob and Bretton ride into the city. Bretton takes a call

          on his Vertu.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

                          (INTO PHONE)

           Yes... you have to be kidding me.

          He disconnects the call with a mischievous smile and turns to

          Jacob.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           Looks like a bit of news broke while

           we were in the air...

          And Bretton turns on Fox Business to see footage of... The

          Governor of New York standing at a podium next to his WIFE.

          He doesn't look happy as he says...

           GOVERNOR (ON THE TV)

           The remorse I feel will always be with

           me. Words cannot describe how

           grateful I am for the love and

           compassion they have shown me. From

           those to whom much is given, much is

           expected..

           62.

          Jacob's confused... Bretton's enjoying every second of

          this...

                          BRETTON WOODS

           He's been after us for years...

           GOVERNOR (ON THE TV)

           I have been given much -- the love of

           my family, the faith and trust of the

           people of New York, and the chance to

           lead this state

          Laughing with delight...

                          BRETTON WOODS

           Oh Jacob... you don't want to live in

           a glass house if you're gonna play

           this game.

                          JACOB

           I don't understand. Is he resigning?

                          BRETTON WOODS

           Yes sir.

                          JACOB

           What'd he do?

          And Bretton simply turns to him and says...

                          BRETTON WOODS

           Outsourced.

          EXT. BURJ AL ARAB HOTEL - DAY

          1,000-foot-tall feat of modern design, perched on the edge of

          the Persian Gulf.

          As the Jetvan pulls out front...

           BRETTON WOODS (V.O.)

           There's a big party for Oleg tonight

           at a club called The Left Bank. It's

           Roaring 20s themed so I've had

           original suits from that era delivered

           to our rooms.

          INT. BURJ AL ARAB/LOBBY - DAY

          As Jacob and Bretton walk through the ridiculously opulent

          lobby plated in gold leaf.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           Remember. Hedge funds are not banking

           and this isn't Ivy-league-geography-

           ninth-hole deal making.

           63.

          INT. HALLWAY - DAY

          As they walk down the hall to their suites... Contango and

          Backwardation tagging along.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           Oleg's a brute, he's has A.D.D. and he

           likes to party.

          As they stop in front of large double doors... the BELLMAN

          opens the doors to reveal...

          THE BURJ AL ARAB PREMIERE SUITE

          Makes the Rainman Suite at Caesar's look like a standard room

          at a Motel 6. 7000 square feet, 360 degree view, 70 inch

          plasmas share the walls with Picassos and Monets.

          Bretton nods over to the double doors across the hall...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           I'm just down the hall.

           (with a smile)

           I hope you don't mind I took the nicer

           one.

          INT. JACOB'S SUITE/BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Now dressed in a tightly-fitting suit over a white shirt with

          wing collars and stove-pipe skinny trousers, Jacob stands in

          front of the mirror.

          As Jacob throws on a top hat and admires the 1928 version of

          himself....

          INT. THE LEFT BANK - NIGHT

          A Roaring 20's party is taking place... it's full-on

          speakeasy vibe. It's right out of 1928, only with Europeans,

          Russians and Middle-Easterners.

          Smoke fills the room. A jazz band roars. Drinks flow.

          As Jacob and Bretton head in...

                          BRETTON WOODS

           If he offers you a drink -- take it.

          And with that, Bretton points across the room where OLEG

          BAKUNIN sits.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           If he offers you a line of coke --

           snort it.

          He's in his mid-40s, overweight, sweaty, draped in tight

          black Prada and smoking a cigarette.

           64.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           If he offers you a child -- raise it.

          And it seems A MODEL BOMB has recently exploded at Oleg's

          table... leaving the skinny shards everywhere.

          Oleg sees them, stands and opens his arms.

                          OLEG

           Bretton Woods has arrived.

          Bretton smiles. They head over. Oleg turns to one of the

          MODEL GIRLS next to him.

                          OLEG (CONT'D)

           I want you to meet one of the only men

           in the world who might be as rich as I

           am. Wait a minute... Bretton what did

           oil close at today?

                          BRETTON WOODS

           A hundred and twenty-nine dollars a

           barrel.

                          OLEG

           (to Model Girl)

           Forget what I said -- I'm much richer

           than him.

          Oleg then looks at Jacob.

                          OLEG (CONT'D)

           Who the fuck is this?

                          JACOB

           Oleg, I'm Jacob Moore. It's nice to

           meet you.

          Oleg regards Jacob for a beat, then back to Bretton and asks

          again...

                          OLEG

           Who the fuck is this?

          Bretton smiles...

                          BRETTON WOODS

           Jacob has recently come over from KZI

           to work with me.

          And now Oleg turns to Jacob.

                          OLEG

           KZI? You worked with Andrew Zabel?

          Jacob takes a beat. Then...

                          JACOB

           That's right.

           65.

                          OLEG

           He was a legend.

          Jacob just nods, not showing any emotion. Oleg motions for

          the girls to make room and they all sit...

                          OLEG (CONT'D)

           It was that mortgage shit. He

           should've just focused on managing

           money and not fuck around with that

           crazy mortgage shit.

          Bretton just looks away. Jacob stays cool.

                          OLEG (CONT'D)

           It was a shame his fund was only for

           institutions... I would've liked to

           have invested.

          Oleg motions to a WAITRESS who immediately pours vintage

          champagne.

                          OLEG (CONT'D)

           In honor of the theme tonight, have a

           glass of 1927 Heidsiek champagne...

          Oleg hands Jacob a flute before he can decline.

                          OLEG (CONT'D)

           This is one of two hundred bottles

           discovered on a shipwreck off the

           coast of Finland... thirty grand a

           bottle.

          And Oleg aggressively puts his arm around Jacob, bringing him

          into a drunken half-bear hug and spilling most of the

          champagne out of Jacob's flute.

          EXT. DUBAI HARBOR - NIGHT

          Oleg and some of his crew lead Jacob, Bretton and three

          beautiful, giggling model girls down a trail to a secluded

          mooring.

          Fishing boats bob violently in the water -- and next to them

          is Oleg's Phoenix 1000, his personal, 65-meter SUBMARINE.

          As a boatman helps them all climb aboard:

                          OLEG

           Phoenix 1000.

          INT. SUBMARINE - NIGHT

          As they walk through the ornate deck saloon:

          Oleg beckons Jasper toward a huge panoramic window looking

          out at the city of Dubai.

           66.

          And then the view starts to MOVE. The surface of the water

          RISES before them, Dubai recedes and the submarine descends

          spectacularly into the depths.

                          OLEG

           5000 square feet, 30 days of oxygen

           capacity.

          INT. THE DECK SALOON - NIGHT

          Lights illuminate the dark waters as curious fish flit past.

          Jacob, Bretton and Oleg are on divans, the girls undulating

          around them.

                          OLEG

           Bretton, I have... what?... two

           hundred million with you.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           And hopefully that's just a start.

           Oleg, there are so many opportunities

           out there right now I feel like a kid

           in the candy store.

          Oleg waves him off.

                          OLEG

           You know I like to spread it around...

           I'm like my own fund of funds. I

           don't like to have too much with one

           manager.

          As Oleg shakes cocaine out of an envelope...

                          OLEG (CONT'D)

           You never really know who to trust in

           this world.

          Jacob takes a beat, swallows nervously, then...

                          JACOB

           I couldn't agree more, Oleg. It's one

           of the first things that Andrew Zabel

           taught me. I worked very closely with

           him. It's why Bretton hired me. To

           get behind the Andrew Zabel curtain.

          Bretton flashes Jacob a look... "What the hell are you

          doing?" Jacob swallows back some nerves then continues...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           You said before that you always wanted

           to invest with Zabel but couldn't

           because he only handled institutional

           money. Well here's your chance.

           Zabel taught me everything he knew.

          Oleg looks up to Jacob from the line of coke with interest.

           67.

                          OLEG

           Such as... ?

                          JACOB

           Well, I'm not going to give you the

           whole cake, Oleg...

          He looks over to Bretton who still glares at Jacob...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           But I can give you a little bite...

                          (BEAT)

           It involves building positions in high

           yielding stocks new to volatility then

           writing calls with split strike

           prices.

          And Oleg regards Jacob for a long moment, a jury determining

          the verdict... Jacob holding on to that sly smile... Bretton

          looking away... playing it cool.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           It's complicated but like Bretton said

           -- right now there are more

           opportunities than ever.

          Oleg simply nods... with a simple...

                          OLEG

           Interesting.

          ... then does another line.

          INT. JACOB'S SUITE - NIGHT

          Jacob sleeps. There's a knock on his door. He stirs. The

          knock's louder. Then... Jacob finally wakes, moves to the

          door and opens it to see...

          TWO BEAUTIFUL RUSSIAN WOMEN, PAULINA and NADIA

                          NADIA

           We're here for the party.

          Confused...

                          JACOB

           What party?

                          PAULINA

           Oleg said you needed a party...

          Cozying up to her friend with a smile...

                          NADIA

           ... and we're it.

          Jacob nervously thinks, then...

           68.

                          JACOB

           Come in.

          INT. JACOB'S SUITE - LATER

          We pan across the suite... past the roaring fire...

           PAULINA (O.S.)

           Right there... ?

          ... past the empty bottle of champagne...

           JACOB (O.S.)

           No... not there...

           NADIA (O.S.)

           How about there? I bet you want me to

           do it there.

          ... past the plate of half-eaten chocolate strawberries...

           JACOB (O.S.)

           No... I want you to hold it.

          And find the three of them...

           NADIA (O.S.)

           But it's gone up so much.

          ... sitting at Jacob's computer... looking over a chart for a

          Russian oil company.

                          JACOB

           I know... but if you're going to

           correctly utilize this technical head

           and shoulders strategy, you need to

           hold the stock until...

           (pointing on the chart)

           ... right here.

                          PAULINA

           I always sell too soon.

                          JACOB

           Very common mistake. You need to cut

           your losers short and let your winners

           run.

          She looks to her friend with a smile...

                          NADIA

           Good advice for everything... no?

          Her friend agrees with a laugh. And Jacob checks the clock.

                          JACOB

           Okay. I think enough time has passed.

           I appreciate you guys keeping our

           little secret.

           69.

          As he walks them to the door...

                          NADIA

           You must love her very much.

                          JACOB

           I do.

          Jacob opens the door to let them go but he hears a door open

          across the hall... Bretton's.

          And they all witness a YOUNGER AMERICAN WOMAN leave Bretton's

          room then head down the hall right by them.

          Jacob's stunned.

                          PAULINA

           The most famous hooker in the world.

          Off Jacob's confusion...

          THE YOUNGER AMERICAN WOMAN

          that had just left Bretton's room looks right at us under the

          caption "The Governor's $5000 Mistake"

          Pull back to be on Perezhilton.com

          Jacob Moore sits in front of his computer. And he turns to

          Paulina.

                          JACOB

           Is she a gift from Oleg?

                          PAULINA

           No. She's Bretton's go-to.

                          NADIA

           He flies her in wherever he's at.

          And Jacob slowly takes that in... absolutely floored.

          INT. BURJ AL ARAB/LOBBY - MORNING

          Wearing sunglasses, Jacob greets Bretton at the elevators.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           You look like crap.

          They walk for the exit.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           Let me ask you something... was that

           speech about split strike prices and

           stocks new to volatility for real?

                          JACOB

           No Bretton. That was all bullshit.

           70.

          Bretton smiles.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           Well, it worked. Oleg's wiring us

           five hundred million dollars today.

          And Bretton turns to Jacob... impressed.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           Good job, Jacob...

          And as they head out into the Dubai heat...

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.)(PRE-LAP)

           So he trust you now.

          EXT. BOWLING GREEN PARK - DAY

          The iconic charging bull of Wall Street.

           JACOB (V.O.)

           I think so.

          Travel the park to find... Jacob and Gordon stopping at the

          food vendors.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Well, I'm happy to help.

                          (AND THEN)

           What about your end of the trade,

           Sport?

                          JACOB

           Oh... I'm still working on it.

                          (BEAT)

           I'll talk to her. I promise.

                          GORDON GEKKO

                          (TO VENDOR)

           Hot dog.

                          (TO JACOB)

           What do you want?

                          JACOB

                          (TO VENDOR)

           I'll take a pretzel.

          As they get their food and walk...

                          GORDON GEKKO

           So you're a hedge fund cowboy now?

          Shaking his head...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           Goddamn hedge funds -- what a racket.

           Playing the world casino, betting

           other people's money with leverage.

           And it's completely legal and

           completely unregulated.

                          (MORE)

           71.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           The hustles they get away with make

           insider trading seem like a parking

           ticket.

          SLAM INTO THE FRONTIER FUND/TRADING PIT

          Rows and rows of computers in a large dark room....

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           Nassim Tariq and his Frontier Fund.

           With their slews of MIT grads who

           become glorified millionaire robots

           pushing buttons...

          ... with casually dressed ASIANS and INDIANS in their 20s

          working the keyboards like zombies.

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           ... slaves to top-secret propriety

           elegant algorithms that work until

           they don't.

          AND SLAM INTO ESSEX CAPITAL ADVISERS/CONFERENCE ROOM

          A stuffy conference room half-filled with bored MEN in their

          40s watching a presentation...

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           Or the baby cub funds like Sammy

           Rosen's Essex Advisers... filled with

           Goldman Sachs and Julian Robertson

           pedigree.

          Most of the men type on their blackberrys... one is actually

          asleep.

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           Men who are way too rich, lazy and

           tired to run money properly anymore.

          THEN SLAM INTO THE DANIELS ACTIVIST FUND/ALLAN DANIELS'S

                         OFFICE

          A small cluttered office with papers strewn about...

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           Or Allan Daniel's and his bully

           operation.

          ALLAN DANIELS, a small bull-dog of a man, paces back and

          forth... dictating in anger. His SECRETARY types down every

          word he's shouting.

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           ... with his angry letters to company

           boards that are nothing but veiled

           threats in the name of activism.

          AND RIGHT BACK TO BOWLING GREEN PARK

          Where Gordon stops walking...

           72.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           So you're inside... you have his

           trust... and now you want to know

           what's next.

          And Jacob's look over to Gekko confirms this.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           Here's the thing about Bretton. He

           puts all of his money into his own

           fund which makes him stupid,

           egotistical, and most importantly...

           vulnerable.

                          (BEAT)

           And he chases. He doesn't take losses

           well and he chases with leverage. He

           thinks he's a trader, he thinks he's

           an investor but he's not. He's a

           gambler.

          Regarding Jacob...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           That pretzel looks good.

          Jacob just shrugs.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           Care to make a trade?

                          JACOB

           Whatever.

          And they trade. The hotdog for the pretzel.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           As for your end of our trade.

                          (BEAT)

           Find a way for me to reunite with my

           daughter, Jake. Because we both know

           how she would react to the fact that

           you've been lying to her about bonding

           with your future father-in-law.

          Just standing there... holding that hot dog...

                          JACOB

           Is that a threat?

          Looking Jacob dead on...

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Absolutely.

          Jacob just shakes his head with a laugh... now realizing that

          Gekko talked him into this position for this exact leverage.

                          JACOB

           You're priceless, Gordon.

           73.

          With a smile...

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Just be happy I'm on your team.

                          (AND THEN)

           Get him into a bad position and watch

           him chase it.

                          JACOB

           What bad position?

                          GORDON GEKKO

           What have I been saying all along,

           Kid?

                          JACOB

           Financials.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           They're a death trap -- mark my words.

          INT. THE LOCUST FUND/JACOB'S OFFICE - DAY

          As Jacob takes in his new view... it's spectacular.

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.)

           But he won't fall for a brokerage or

           bank play this late in the game.

           Everyone knows they're poison.

          AND TIME LAPSE

          As the office grows furniture... a plasma on the wall...

          a computer on the desk...

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           Sell him on insurance. There's a case

           to be made for those stocks... ill-

           fated as they may be.

          ... books on the shelves... pictures on the walls...

          a couch and table... a paper shredder and waste baskets...

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           But take your time... make him think

           you've been doing your due diligence.

          Find Jacob at his desk... working away at his computer...

          it's late at night.

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           Make it look like you're working your

           ass off to find him this genius

           trade... come in early, leave late and

           don't bring up the idea for at least a

           few weeks.

          And Jacob finally gets up from his desk... goes to the

          window... looking across midtown Manhattan...

           74.

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           And then Jacob...

          ... eyes pasted on a building made of glass and steel... a

          building he once called home...

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           ... sell him hard... then watch him

           bite... then watch him chase...

          ... KZI Investments.

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           ... then watch him come undone.

          EXT. 533 THIRD AVENUE - DAY

          Holding his suitcase, Jacob emerges from the elevator and

          heads for a waiting town car.

          Jacob sees Diego...

                          JACOB

           Bring it.

          Diego smiles... loves this new one...

                          DIEGO

           What's the most dangerous question on

           Wall Street?

                          JACOB

           Tell me.

                          DIEGO

           "How are you?"

          And Jacob agrees whole-heartedly as he heads on his way.

          EXT. WASHINGTON DC - MORNING

          As the sun rises over our nation's capital.

          EXT. ROCK CREEK PARK - MORNING

          Winnie and Jacob jog the park through the humid July haze.

          It's very early.

          And Jacob stops jogging. Catches his breath. She keeps

          running.

                          JACOB

           Why are you with me?

          She stops and turns back to him.

                          WINNIE

           What?

           75.

                          JACOB

           You hate finance. You hate Wall

           Street. Why are you with me?

          Winnie nods. It's a valid question. And she thinks about it

          for a moment, then...

                          WINNIE

           Repetition compulsion.

                          JACOB

           Huh?

                          WINNIE

           It's Freud.

                          JACOB

           And what does it mean, psych major?

                          WINNIE

           Well, it's when people repeat the same

           dysfunctional relationships from

           childhood in their adult life in hopes

           of trying to master them.

                          JACOB

           Like when children of alcoholics fall

           in love with alcoholics.

                          WINNIE

           Yeah.

          He turns away... upset.

                          JACOB

           That's great, Winnie.

                          WINNIE

           Jacob, that might be why I was

           initially attracted to you... but it's

           not why I love you.

          She moves to him.

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)

           I love you because you're

           compassionate and you care so deeply

           about what you do and you have like no

           ego, it's crazy.

          She reaches to him... turning his face to meet hers.

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)

           And you're the smartest person I've

           ever met... and there's nobody I trust

           more in the world.

          Jacob looks away... almost ashamed. And Winnie can sense

          something's not right.

           76.

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)

           What's wrong?

                          JACOB

           Nothing...

          As Jacob draws in a deep breath, collects himself and finally

          turns back to her with...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           I just wish you would master that

           relationship from childhood so you can

           move forward with this one.

          AND WERE BACK ON THE CHART

          As a circle forms on July 20th then travels down the trend

          and stops.

          And as a circle is formed around August 11th, we...

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. WESTSIDE HIGHWAY- DAY

          And Manhattan... as it sweats through the heart of summer.

          Two jetvans ride uptown...

          INT. JETVAN - DAY

          As Jacob rides with Bretton...

                          JACOB

           Bretton... I found something I like.

          Bretton looks over to him.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           I've been wondering when my new

           portfolio manager was going to come to

           me with something special.

                          JACOB

           I just wanted to make sure I would be

           bringing you the smartest idea

           possible. I know you don't go light.

          Confirming...

                          BRETTON WOODS

           That's right. If I commit to this...

           we go large and we don't back down.

                          JACOB

           It might be better to do this in the

           office. I have color and support to

                          PRESENT--

          Waving him off...

           77.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           C'mon Jacob, you know that's not how

           we do.

          EXT. ADIRONDACK FOREST PRESERVE - DAY

          2.7 million acres of State protected majestic land. All

          nature... rivers and lakes... cypresses and maples. Clean

          air. And trails. Many trails that go on for miles.

          As the two Becker jetvans arrive at a restricted area, a

          STATE RANGER opens the gate and allows them to drive through

          then park.

          Jacob and Bretton emerge from the jetvan.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           This is how we do.

          And with a nod, the DRIVER of the other jetvan opens it to

          reveal two motorcycles inside. Bretton's MTT Turbine

          Superbike and an Agusta, these bikes are handcrafted works of

          art as much as they are demons of speed.

          Jacob laughs in disbelief and excitement.

                          JACOB

           And we're allowed to ride these

           through here?

          Sucking in the fresh summer air...

                          BRETTON WOODS

           No.

          AND JACOB AND BRETTON

          Now decked out in leather riding gear... on the bikes... at

          the mouth of the trail... revving the engines...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           Follow me...

          And with that, shoots into the forest. Jacob quickly

          follows.

          AND THEY RIDE

          Winding through the trees... along the side of a river...

          Bretton riding extremely fast with Jacob trying to keep up.

          Bretton reaches a clearing and waits for Jacob to catch up.

          Once he does...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           You're going to have to keep up.

                          JACOB

           Okay. I'm just getting used to it.

           78.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           Tell me your idea.

                          JACOB

           Here?

                          BRETTON WOODS

           Where else?

                          JACOB

           Right. Okay.

                          (COLLECTING HIMSELF)

           Are you still short any of the

           financials?

                          BRETTON WOODS

           No. After KZI, I took profits.

                          JACOB

           I think it's time to go the other way.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           Banks?

                          JACOB

           Insurance companies. I'm talking the

           old school insurers that have become

           the babies thrown out with the bath

           water.

          Jacob waits for a reaction from Bretton. But all he gets

          is...

                          BRETTON WOODS

           Keep up!

          And with that, Bretton rips into the clearing. Jacob rides

          just as fast. They're neck and neck... it's definitely a

          race.

          Bretton pulls ahead but Jacob doesn't give up.

          As they move quickly toward a patch of forest with a only

          narrow trail entering it, Jacob focuses on the horizon and

          revs the bike into more speed. He pulls up next to Bretton

          as they approach the trail.

          If Jacob doesn't slow down, and fall in line behind Bretton,

          he's going to hit the trees. But he doesn't.

          Instead, Jacob blasts the bike into its final dose of speed,

          narrowly avoiding impact by zipping into the trail... pulling

          ahead of Bretton and taking the lead.

          A TRANQUIL LAKE

          As it sits still in the setting sun. Untouched by man.

          Bretton and Jacob get off the bikes and walk to the shore.

          As they catch their breaths and enjoy the beauty...

           79.

                          JACOB

           The basket of stocks I'm putting

           together focuses on reinsurance

           brokering and management services for

           businesses. They're trading below

           book and have large dividends.

                          (BEAT)

           I say we buy them here.

          Bretton thinks about it. He's not sure.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           Financials are a falling knife.

          Jacob nods...

                          JACOB

           I'm not arguing that... but the best

           opportunities are found where angels

           fear to tread.

          Jacob can see... he has Bretton on the hook.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           So yeah -- they are falling knives.

           But Bretton...

          And with confidence... driving it home...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           ... what's life without a little blood

           on your hands?

          INT. JACOB'S OFFICE - DAY

          As WORKERS install an electronic ticker that wraps around the

          top circumference of the whole office... similar to the one

          Andrew Zabel had.

           BRETTON WOODS (V.O.)

           Okay. Then I want you to build

           positions in your favorite three

           names.

          Jacob picks up the phone and...

          THE SCREEN SPLITS IN TWO

          With Jacob on top and Robby on the bottom.

          As Robby takes the order and starts typing into his

          Bloomberg...

           BRETTON WOODS (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           I want you stealth. Use all six

           trading desks we're in business with.

          NOW ROBBY'S HALF OF THE SCREEN SPLITS INTO 6 SMALL BOXES

           80.

          Six different trading desks... six different BROKERS taking

          calls from Jacob who still owns the whole top half of the

          screen.

           BRETTON WOODS (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           And if they go down... we increase our

           size.

          AND BACK TO JACOB

          Leaning back... feet on desk... staring at the ticker...

          which only has three stocks on it...

           BRETTON WOODS (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           See Jacob -- I don't believe in

           "wrong."

          MCC at $21.65, ACN at $16.24 and ISS at $7.23.

           BRETTON WOODS (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           I only believe in "not right yet."

          EXT. UPPER WEST SIDE - NIGHT

          A rainstorm takes over the city. A cab pulls out front of

          Shun Lee Cafe.

          INT. TAXI - NIGHT

          Winnie sucks in a deep breath.

                          WINNIE

           He chose this restaurant.

          Jacob confirms.

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)

           We used to come here every Sunday

           night.

          He takes her hand.

                          JACOB

           You're going to be fine.

                          WINNIE

           I'm only doing this for you.

                          JACOB

           No. You're doing this for you.

          She just glares at him.

                          WINNIE

           We're never having sex again.

                          JACOB

           Then what my friends say about

           marriage will be true.

           81.

          And she nervously fights back a smile...

                          WINNIE

           Oh, shut up.

          INT. SHUN LEE CAFE - NIGHT

          The HOST leads Winnie and Jacob through the grand dining

          room. Gordon sees them and stands up. We can tell he's

          anxious as well.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Hi.

          Fighting back the nerves...

                          WINNIE

           Hey.

          They just stand there. Jacob holds out his hand.

                          JACOB

           Mr. Gekko, I'm Jacob Moore, we spoke

           on the phone. Nice to finally meet in

           person.

          Gekko just looks at him for an extra long beat, then...

          shakes his hand.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Yes.

          They all sit.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           Jacob, shall we get some wine?

                          JACOB

           I don't drink.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Oh... okay.

          Then Gordon attempts a smile over to his daughter.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           Let me guess... the ginger garlic

           lobster.

                          WINNIE

                          (TO JACOB)

           I used to order that every time.

          She closes her menu.

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)

           I'm not really hungry.

           82.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           I've been following your career,

           Winnie. Senator Lehigh said some very

           nice things about you in The American

           Prospect interview.

                          WINNIE

           Yeah. She's really been... very...

           supportive of my...

          And it trails off... as she just glares at Gordon.

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)

           I can't do this.

          She exhales, stands and looks down to Jacob.

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)

           I'm sorry. I can't do this.

          And she quickly walks off. Jacob frozen. Until Gordon looks

          over to him with...

                          GORDON GEKKO

           It's okay. This is a long term

           investment.

                          (BEAT)

           Go after her. She needs you.

          And Jacob does. As Gordon looks down... disappointed.

          INT. WEST 65TH - NIGHT

          Pouring rain. Jacob runs after her.

                          JACOB

           Winnie... Winnie...

          He turns her around.

                          WINNIE

           You don't understand.

          Her tears being washed away by the rain.

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)

           My mother couldn't handle Rudy. He

           was so out of control. I couldn't

           help him.

          Jacob takes her into his hold...

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)

                          (RE GEKKO)

           If he wasn't in prison... if he had

           been there. I know it would've been

           different.

                          JACOB

           Your brother's dead, Winnie.

           83.

          Squeezing her tight...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           Your father isn't.

                          WINNIE

           He's not the person people think he

           is.

                          JACOB

           It was a long time ago.

          She pulls out of his embrace...

                          WINNIE

           He'll hurt us. Can't we just go home?

           Please... Jacob. It's raining.

          And he just looks at her for a long moment... soaking wet and

          shivering... crying and exposed.

                          JACOB

           (what am I doing?)

           I love you. You don't have to do

           this.

                          (AND THEN)

           Let's just go home.

          INT. JACOB'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Darkness. The phone rings. Jacob answers it.

                          JACOB

           Yes.

          INTERCUT WITH...

                          BRETTON WOODS

           Your insurance companies are down.

          He's working a coffee in the master suite of The Black Swan

          Home...

                          JACOB

           Bretton.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           I want to increase our size.

          Glancing at the LCD, 12:23am...

                          JACOB

           Okay. Good. It's just a matter of

           time before they turn. I'll call the

                          DESKS TOMORROW--

                          BRETTON WOODS

           Jacob, I want you to triple our

           positions on all three.

           84.

          Jacob takes a beat.

                          JACOB

           Okay.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           And they better fucking go up.

          Click. And as Jacob just looks at the phone...

           GORDON GEKKO (PRELAP)

           The instant you know you're in trouble

           is the exact moment when a sound

           investment thesis turns into blind

           hope.

          INT. NORMA'S - MORNING

          Jacob sits across from Gordon at this well-known breakfast

          spot in the Parker Meridian hotel.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Tripling the size... that's a very

           aggressive move.

          Jacob nods.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           And I promise you he's using leverage

           to do this.

                          JACOB

           He's chasing.

          Suddenly, a MAN approaches the table. He's in his thirties.

                          TOM

           Mr Gekko, I'm Tom Sanders. I write

           for Barrons.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           I've heard of it.

          Letting out a little laugh...

                          TOM

           I'm sure you have.

                          (BEAT)

           Well, I'm doing a piece of Wall Street

           moguls who ended up going to prison.

           I've already talked to Boesky and

           Milken and would love to sit down with

           you.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Can you give me the cover?

          Tom isn't sure if Gordon's serious. Either is Jacob.

           85.

                          TOM

           Well, I... um... don't make those

           decisions.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Get me the cover and I'll give you

           seventy minutes.

          Tom politely smiles.

                          TOM

           I'll... take that as a no.

          ... and goes. Gordon looks down to his breakfast and quietly

          asserts...

                          GORDON GEKKO

           (almost to himself)

           Both those assholes got the cover when

           they were convicted.

          And after a moment...

                          JACOB

           How do we know the insurance companies

           are going to continue going down?

          As he casually places his egg on a piece of toast...

                          GORDON GEKKO

           It's all going down.

          ... and takes a bite.

          AND THREE CHARTS NOW FILL THE SCREEN

          Side by side... above the charts are written respectively

          MCC, ACN and ISS.

          And we follow all the three trend lines from Aug 17th forward

          to the right... and they all move down.

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           Just wait.

          And we stop in September. And as a blue circle is formed

          over Sept 13th on all three charts, we...

                          CUT TO:

          TIME WARNER CENTER/BALLROOM

          This is The Financial Follies... an annual event held by the

          financial writers association.

          500 people sit at tables, enjoying this dinner and live show

          that pokes fun at people in the world of finance.

          Everyone who's anyone in high finance is here.

           86.

          On the stage, the spotlight finds BILL MAHER and the applause

          breaks out...

                          BILL MAHER

           Welcome to the 2008 Financial Follies!

                          (APPLAUDS)

           I'm Bill Maher and I'm getting paid in

           Euros.

          Jacob shares a table with Bretton, Bretton's wife and a few

          other FINANCIAL PLAYERS. Winnie is not here.

           BILL MAHER (CONT'D)

           When The Financial Writers Association

           asked me to host an event for the

           world of finance, I was shocked. I'm

           known in Washington not Wall Street...

                          (BEAT)

           ... but then they informed me that

           Washington is actually in the process

           of buying Wall Street, so it all makes

           sense.

          Laughter...

           BILL MAHER (CONT'D)

           I asked them if anything's off limits.

           And they said to stay away from the

           brokerages, banks and insurers...

           (pause for effect, then...)

           ... where the fuck was that advice

           five months ago?

          More laughter.

           BILL MAHER (CONT'D)

           I see Sammy Rosen's here.

          The spotlight finds SAMMY ROSEN, billionaire hedge funder.

           BILL MAHER (CONT'D)

           Sammy, how are you?

          From his table...

                          SAMMY ROSEN

           Doing well.

                          BILL MAHER

           (to the room)

           Of course he is... in the amount of

           time it took for us to have that

           exchange, he made three hundred and

           nine thousand dollars.

           (back to Sammy)

           Sammy, let me give you some free

           advice, the next time someone with bad

           eyesight wants to sell you a hundred

           and fifty million dollar painting...

           don't let them personally deliver it.

           87.

          It's an inside joke that this room gets...

           BILL MAHER (CONT'D)

           Somebody told me Gordon Gekko is here.

           Gordon... ?

          Across the room, a spotlight finds Gordon...

           BILL MAHER (CONT'D)

           There you are. I have some inside

           information for you, Gekko... sex

           sells books, not bread lines.

          Gordon smiles and raises his glass up to Bill.

           BILL MAHER (CONT'D)

           Talk about your sour grapes.

           Seriously Gordon -- just because the

           SEC doesn't let you make obscene

           amounts of money by being wrong and

           nefarious doesn't mean you have to

           ruin it for all of these hard working

           people.

          The room applauds...

           BILL MAHER (CONT'D)

           Okay, we have a video to show now.

           It's a very detailed and academic

           account of the current mortgage

           crises. Let `er rip!

          And the room goes dark... and on the screen plays a childlike

          roughly illustrated stick-figure skit being narrated by

          children.

                         FIRST FRAME

          Under the caption "Main Street National Bank" is a drawing of

          a Poor Man sitting across from a Banker Man behind his desk.

                          POOR MAN

           I'd like a mortgage... I don't really

           have any money though... is that cool?

                          BANKER MAN

           Totally cool. Since housing prices

           are always going up it won't be a

           problem.

                          POOR MAN

           You guys are awesome!

                         NEXT FRAME

          Under the caption "A few weeks later at the bank..."

          Banker Man now stands over a pile of steaming shit.

           88.

                          BANKER MAN

           Wow, these mortgages are really

           beginning to smell. I better sell

           them to smart people.

                         NEXT FRAME

          Under the caption of "Smart People Investment Bank" Smart Man

          stands over the same steaming pile of shit.

                          SMART MAN

           Wow, these mortgages we just bought

           really smell. I better sell them to

           foreigners.

                         NEXT FRAME

          Under the caption of "The CDO Factory" our smart man oversees

          an assembly line of stick figure workers.

           SMART MAN (CONT'D)

           Mix those crappy mortgages in real

           good with the clean ones so the rating

           agencies won't smell them.

                         NEXT FRAME

          Under the caption of "Rich Man Hedge Fund" a stick figure

          named Rich Man sits behind his desk and holds a phone to his

          ear.

                          RICH MAN

           Good news, Smart Man, not only did

           foreigners buy those traunches, but so

           did school boards and charities and

           big pensions.

                          (BEAT)

           Why did they buy them you ask? Well,

           they were looking for a really secure

           risk-free investment and they were all

           triple A, so...

                         NEXT FRAME

          Under the caption "Norwegian Village Pension Fund" a

          Norwegian Man sits behind his desk and shouts into his phone.

                          NORWEGIAN MAN

           Hey man! What the fuck? We're not

           receiving our monthly payments!

                         NEXT FRAME

          Under the caption "Rich Man Hedge Fund," Rich Man at his desk

          on the phone.

                          RICH MAN

           Yeah, we fucked up.

           89.

          And it now shuffles between the last two frames... the

          Norwegian Man and Rich Man.

                          NORWEGIAN MAN

           What about the rating agencies?

                          RICH MAN

           Yeah, they fucked up too.

                          NORWEGIAN MAN

           What about the investment bank that

           put these CDO's together?

                          RICH MAN

           Fucked up.

                          NORWEGIAN MAN

           What about the bank that made the

           original loan?

                          RICH MAN

           Totally fucked up.

                          NORWEGIAN MAN

           What am I supposed to tell my

           villagers?

                          RICH MAN

           That you fucked up.

          The final frame

          Just the rendering of that steaming pile of shit under the

          caption... "The End."

          And the lights go on to a some subdued laughter and a

          smattering of applause.

                          BILL MAHER

           What a year -- enjoy the night!

          INT. FINANCIAL FOLLIES - LATER

          Desert is served. Jackets are off, cigars are lit, Bretton's

          wife has gone home. The group at the table is a little drunk

          and having a good time.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           It's a good question... what do you

           think, George?

          GEORGE, an investment banker at the table, thinks about it.

                          GEORGE

           The definition of rich... flying

           private.

          The table reacts... some agree, other don't. George turns to

          Jacob.

           90.

                          GEORGE (CONT'D)

           Jacob... ? What do you think?

                          JACOB

           To be rich... is to have the love of a

           good woman.

          They all boo...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           (with a smile)

           For real... I truly believe that.

          And Jacob turns to Bretton...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           Bretton... what's your definition of

           rich?

          An approaching voice answers it for him.

           VOICE (O.S.)

           To have twice as much money as you

           currently do.

          As he takes a seat...

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Isn't that what you always say,

           Bretton?

          Then... announcing to the table...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           He brings up the question, runs it

           round the table then finishes with

           that. It's an old bit.

          Also announcing to the table...

                          BRETTON WOODS

           Be careful Gordon...

           (looking at Jacob)

           ... your daughter's financial health

           is in my hands now.

          Jacob loses his smile... suddenly becoming uncomfortable.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           That's right.

                          (BEAT)

           And the way The Locust Fund has been

           buying up the insurance companies

           lately makes me worried about my

           future grandchildren's college

           educations.

                          JACOB

                          (TO BRETTON)

           I didn't tell him.

           91.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           No, I don't suppose you did.

          Bretton looks over to Jacob.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           Go ahead, Jacob, preach your book...

           defend your names.

          And Jacob turns to Gordon...

                          JACOB

           We have a proactive central bank, the

           charts show a clear bottom on July

           15th and these companies are trading

           at half of what they were six months

           ago.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Just cause it's low don't make it

           cheap, Sport.

                          JACOB

           I read your book.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           It's not out yet.

                          JACOB

           I have a friend in publishing.

                          (BEAT)

           25% unemployment... stagflation...

           bread lines... Martial law...

           government seizures of assets and

           gold... end of democracy...

          Bretton leans back... taking in this sparring match.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           Really Gordon? Do you really need

           attention that badly?

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Since I have forty-four seconds to

           spare, I'm going to tell you a story.

           It's about a guy named Sam.

          And we go close on Gekko...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           Sam used to work a job, he made things

           and he grew things and he sold those

           things. Until one day Sam got a

           credit card and was amazed how easy it

           was to buy things with it. So Sam got

           another card and then another. Then

           he used the credit card money to make

           it look like he had an income... and

           he used that "income" to secure a

           loan.

                          (MORE)

           92.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           And with that loan Sam bought a fancy

           BMW car and rented a fancy penthouse

           apartment.

                          (BEAT)

           Now, the credit cards hit their limit

           and the bank needed him to service

           that loan, so Sam went to his friends.

           His Chinese friend... and his Japanese

           friend... and his British friend and

           so on. And his friends loaned Sam

           money.

                          (ANOTHER BEAT)

           And that brings us to today... where

           Sam owes the credit cards and Sam owes

           the banks and Sam owes his friends and

           eventually they're going to take away

           Sam's fancy BMW car and his fancy

           penthouse apartment.

          And Jacob can now see... in Gordon Gekko's eyes... he truly

          believes every word he's saying.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           And Sam doesn't make anything anymore

           and Sam doesn't grow anything anymore

           so Sam doesn't sell anything anymore.

          As he stands...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           Our favorite Uncle Sam's desperate,

           Jake... and he just found a printing

           press in his basement.

                          (BEAT)

           So you tell me -- where do we go from

           here?

          And with that, Gordon Gekko goes.

                          BRETTON WOODS

                          (RE GEKKO)

           It is sad isn't it? That he can't

           just take his ball and go home.

                          (BEAT)

           That he has to piss on the whole game.

          EXT. 533 THIRD AVENUE - MORNING

          Rushed, Jacob heads through the lobby of his building. Diego

          catches his stride.

                          DIEGO

           (doing his best Howard

                          COSELL)

           Down goes Lehman! Down goes Lehman!

           Down goes Lehman!

          And Jacob just keeps walking...

           93.

          INT. THE LOCUST FUND/JACOB'S OFFICE - MORNING

          Jacob heads into the office to find Bretton sitting behind

          his desk.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           They're not going to save it. They're

           just going to let it bloody die!

          And sure enough... on the tv... Fox Business runs footage of

          Lehman Brother's demise. On the screen, the chyron screams:

          $700 BILLION GOVERNMENT BAILOUT TO THE BANKS!

           ALEXIS GLICK (ON TV)

           And as another US banking institution

           collapses, Congress is working quickly

           on a bailout package that will

           distribute over three hundred billion

           dollars to other banks in trouble.

          Bretton turns off the tv and looks to Jacob with...

                          BRETTON WOODS

           We're getting fucking killed.

          And Jacob looks up to his electronic ticker...

          MCC $18.53 -2.34, ACN $12.04 -1.35, ISS $7.03 -.65.

                          JACOB

           It's capitulation.

          Bretton holds Jacob's look... fighting to keep his composure.

          Until... he simply stands and offers Jacob his desk back.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           Then buy more.

          Jacob takes his chair and reaches for the phone.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           Cost us down to current levels.

          Jacob looks up, surprised.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           It's just a question of time before

           this turns around... right?

          And he glares at Jacob.

                          JACOB

           Right.

          Bretton just stares nervously at the electronic ticker... a

          frazzled gambler talking himself into his bet.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           Fuck it.

           94.

          As he goes...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           Leverage is sexy.

          AND WERE BACK ON THE CHART

          As a circle forms on Sept 16th then travels down the trend

          line and stops.

          And as a circle is formed around the Sept 24th, we...

                          CUT TO:

          INT. JACOB'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          LCD reads 4:43 am. Jacob lays awake... staring at the

          ceiling.

           WINNIE (O.S.)

           I would hear him in the kitchen.

          Jacob turns to see she's awake.

                          JACOB

           I'm sorry, you have an early train.

           I'm going to just go to the office

           now.

          She leans up.

                          WINNIE

           He didn't want to keep my mother awake

           so he'd go into the kitchen and sit

           there. I could hear him because my

           room was right up the back stairs.

           I'd go and sit with him sometimes.

           We'd eat ice cream.

          Jacob gets out of bed and throws on his robe.

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)

           I was only eight but I could tell he

           was worried about something and that

           made me worried.

           (softly, almost to herself)

           Then the market would go back up and

           he would sleep through the night

           again.

                          JACOB

           It's not the market, Winnie.

          As he sits on the edge of the bed...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           It's just that I haven't been able to

           sleep through the night since...

          The thought trails off... she leans up and kisses him.

           95.

                          WINNIE

           I wish I could tell you something was

           going to come along that would make it

           better but I can't. It's just going

           to take time, Jacob. A lot of time.

          And she looks into his eyes...

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)

           Have you been counting Fridays?

          He slowly nods.

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)

           I still count Tuesdays.

                          (BEAT)

           All seven hundred and twenty eight of

           them.

          He leans over and kisses her forehead.

                          JACOB

           Go back to sleep.

          And he goes...

          After a beat, she sees Jacob's wallet.

                          WINNIE

           (calling out after him)

           Jacob, you forgot...

          She jumps out of bed, grabs the wallet and goes after him,

          but... it opens up and Winnie notices the picture inside.

          And she stops, staring at that picture.

          Her and her father on that white horse... taken years ago.

          A picture she knows she never gave to Jacob.

          INT. THE LOCUST FUND/JACOB'S OFFICE - MORNING

          Jacob heads in and turns on Fox Business...

           BRIAN SULLIVAN (ON TV)

           It's a complete unmitigated bloodbath

           out there. The S&P tried to rally at

           about 10am but it was met with yet

           another brutal wave of selling and

           people... we're now at our lows for

           the day, the week, the month and the

           year.

          Jacob looks up at ticker on the wall.

          MCC $15.13 -3.40, ACN $10.10 -1.96, ISS $5.14 -1.89.

           96.

          And he stares at that ticker... at the The Locust Fund's

          methodical death.

          Suddenly...

           BRETTON WOODS (O.S.)

           Are you happy?

          He stands in the doorway holding a drink.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           We're done.

          And Bretton CHUCKS the drink against the wall and the glass

          shatters. Jacob takes a step back.

          Bretton's in a complete state as he walks over to Jacob's

          desk and SWIPES it clean... papers flying about.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           Finished...

          Now he picks up the chair...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           Bank notices...

          ... throws it against the window... which cracks.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           Margin calls...

          As he punches the monitor of Jacob's Bloomberg...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           Redemptions...

          And Jacob just stands there... wide-eyed. Just looking at...

                         BRETTON WOODS

          Face full of sweat... blood all over his hand... hair strewn

          about... completely out of breath... bloodshot red eyes... a

          beaten down mess of a man.

                          JACOB

           What happened to composure, Bretton?

                          BRETTON WOODS

           Well, I suppose it went to hell with

           your fucking insurance stocks.

          And Bretton calms down, walks to the window.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           It's not making sense to me anymore.

           The market always made sense to me and

           for the most part... I was better than

           it... quicker than it.

                          (MORE)

           97.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

                          (BEAT)

           But it's moving too fast now and it

           looks like the world is going to shit

           anyway.

          And he faces Jacob Moore.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           If I unwind the fund now I'll still

           walk with six hundred million or so.

          And Jacob's face falls... this is news to him.

                          JACOB

           What?

                          BRETTON WOODS

           It's time to call it a day. Spend

           more time with my family. I suppose

           this moment comes for all of us.

                          JACOB

           You still have six hundred million?

          Bretton vacantly nods.

          And Jacob Moore... trying his best to hide his

          disappointment...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           (almost to himself)

           That's a fortune.

          With a shrug...

                          BRETTON WOODS

           I guess it's all relative.

          Bretton then takes a moment... confirming to himself that

          this is the right decision... then finally looks over to

          Jacob with...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           And Jacob -- you're the worst

           portfolio manager I've ever seen.

          INT. CENTRAL PARK - DUSK

          Sheep's meadow... painted in the soft light of sunset. Fresh

          off his morning run, Gordon wears a sweat suit and works a

          vitamin water. Jacob approaches in his suit.

                          JACOB

           He wants to close the fund... he wants

           to ride off into the fucking sunset...

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Okay...

           98.

                          JACOB

           No, it's not okay... because we're so

           fucking close... and he's going to

           walk with six hundred million dollars

           and that's unacceptable.

          And Gordon sighs in defeat...

                          GORDON GEKKO

           I don't know what to tell you, Pal.

           You wanted to make him bleed, I wanted

           my daughter back...

          As he walks...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           ... looks like life brings

           disappointment to us all.

          And Jacob... as he matches Gordon's stride... in a complete

          state.

                          JACOB

           What happened to slaughtering men,

           Gordon? What happened to turning them

           into penny-ante brokers in

           Poughkeepsie?

          Gordon stops walking.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Look at you. This can't possibly be

           the man my daughter fell in love with.

          Jacob turns away.

                          JACOB

           I want to finish the job.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Why?

                          JACOB

           Because nobody gave a shit about me

           before Andrew Zabel came along.

           Because he didn't deserve what he got.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           The universe is an efficient market,

           Kid... we all get what we deserve.

                          JACOB

           Did you?

          Now it's Gordon who looks away.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           I know you cared about him... and I

           know how that motivates. But Jacob...

           he wasn't such a Saint.

           99.

          And with that, Gordon Gekko heads on his way...

                          JACOB

           What's that supposed to mean?

                          GORDON GEKKO

           You don't want to know.

          Jacob steps forward... shouting out after him...

                          JACOB

           I'm sorry she doesn't want anything to

           do with you, Gordon -- I'm sorry she

           doesn't love you!

          Gordon stops walking. Turns...

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Okay Jake... you want to know.

          Jacob sharply nods.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           Did you ever think about it? I mean

           really think about it? How someone

           could make money year after year...

           even through bear markets?

          Jacob just stands there... listening...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           On November 15th, 1903 an Italian man

           arrived aboard the S.S. Vancouver in

           Boston. He had two dollars and fifty

           cents to his name. Yet just a few

           years later he was millionaire. You

           wanna know how? He had invented a

           scheme... it was quite simple

           actually.

          And Jacob now steps forward... piecing it together...

                          JACOB

           No...

                          GORDON GEKKO

           He would get people to invest with him

           by offering larger than normal returns

           then pay the old investors with the

           new investors money. As long as there

           was fresh money, he could keep going.

           Do you know what his name was, Jacob?

           It was Charles...

                          (BEAT)

           Charles Ponzi.

          FLASH TO AN OLD BRICK BUILDING

          "Jenkov Foundation For Brain Research" above the door...

          RESEARCHERS in lab coats coming in and out of it.

           100.

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           Research facilities...

          THEN TO A COLLEGE CAMPUS

          STUDENTS walking the quad... wearing backpacks and

          socializing...

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           And scholarships...

          THEN TO A BIKE PATH

          Somewhere in Florida. A COUPLE in their 70s enjoying a

          beautiful day... riding bicycles side by side...

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           And retirees...

          AND RIGHT BACK TO CENTRAL PARK

          Gordon steps forward...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           All of them went to bed thinking they

           were perfectly fine... are going to

           wake up to find they're completely

           wiped out...

                          JACOB

           You're lying.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           I'm not, Son. I wish I were.

          Jacob just stands there... stunned with what he's hearing.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           See Jacob, you knew how to get that

           out of me. By playing me off of what

           I really want... my daughter back.

                          (BEAT)

           So you need get Bretton back in the

           game... play him off of what he really

           wants.

          And off Jacob's reaction...

          INT. 15TH STREET DINER - NIGHT

          Jacob shares a table with our Morgan Stanley Portfolio

          Manager.

           MORGAN PORTFOLIO MANAGER

           It's ugly out there dude. I wake up

           everyday wondering if today's the day

           we're going under.

           101.

                          JACOB

           I know. But I do have something for

           you...

          And as Morgan Portfolio Manager leans forward in

          anticipation...

          INT. TOYOTA DEALERSHIP - DAY

          As Jacob and Hedge Fund PM walk the floor... checking out the

          new 2009 Prius.

           HEDGE FUND PM

           I was going to get the new Maserati,

           but... you know...

          Jacob slowly nods. Then...

                          JACOB

           So I heard something earlier today...

          EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - DAY

          As Jacob jogs with our blogger from Streetaccount.com.

                          BLOGGER

           It's so much better working out

           outdoors... that gym was so stuffy.

                          JACOB

           Not to mention expensive.

                          BLOGGER

           Right.

                          JACOB

           So, you've obviously heard the rumor?

          And Blogger looks over to Jacob... he hasn't.

          INT. STREETACCOUNT.COM OFFICES - MORNING

          As our blogger from the gym sips his coffee, fires up his

          computer and starts to type...

          INT. THE CAPITAL FUND/NEW YORK OFFICES - MORNING

          As Hedge Fund PM stands up to present to the team with a

          As Morgan Portfolio receives the digital receipt... "1209

          As the cab stops outside of the building...

           102.

          INT. BRETTON WOODS'S OFFICE - NIGHT

          As the thunder claps outside. Jacob stares at the Goya

          painting... Saturno Devorando a sus hijos Saturn. The man

          being eaten alive.

           BRETTON WOODS (O.S.)

           I don't like unannounced visits.

                          JACOB

           United Bancorp is going under. Wells

           Fargo has stepped up but the offer is

           insanely low.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           I know all this.

                          JACOB

           You still have the fund and you still

           have the leverage that comes with it.

           You want out of the game... buy a

           bank.

          Bretton skeptically regards Jacob.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           Why are you doing this?

                          JACOB

           Because I got you into those insurance

           companies... because I let you down...

          And Bretton... biting his lip in thought...

                          BRETTON WOODS

           I don't like the mortgage toxic waste.

           It can't be quantified... and it

           spreads...

                          JACOB

           I worked it out already. You wouldn't

           have to take it.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           How'd you do that?

                          JACOB

           Well, Wells won't insure the Zabel

           institutional money. It's against

           their policy.

          And then...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           I told them you would.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           Then who would take on the mortgage

           securities?

           103.

                          JACOB

           Uncle Sam.

          Bretton slowly nods... taking all this in...

                          BRETTON WOODS

           So, I'd get the bank, the KZI assets

           including the institutional fund yet

           none of the mortgage securities.

          As Jacob leans forward... going in for the kill...

                          JACOB

           You could actually own the bank your

           father toiled away at his whole

           career. Think about that, Bretton.

          Bretton just shakes his head.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           We're going to lose our credit. I'm

           facing margin calls.

                          JACOB

           So in order to stay in the game... we

           need fresh money.

          Bretton nods...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

                          OLEG--

                          BRETTON WOODS

           (not going to work)

           Oil's crashing.

          Jacob thinks for a moment, then...

                          JACOB

           And how much do we need?

                          BRETTON WOODS

           Fifty, sixty million minimum... and

           that's just to hold off the current

           margin calls.

          And Bretton just sighs...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           God, de-leveraging is a bitch.

          Standing...

                          JACOB

           Sit tight. I'm going to get us the

           money.

          And Jacob goes... Bretton calling out after him...

           104.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           From who... ?

          EXT. UNION SQUARE BORDERS BOOKS - DAY

          "Moral Hazard! Why Wall Street Has Finally Gone Too Far" is

          now everywhere.

          In large cut outs and piles on tables and in the store's

          windows.

          Jacob arrives at the end of the line... New York's newest

          best selling author is having a book signing.

          AND GORDON GEKKO

          Signs a book and looks up at the LADY who gave it to him.

                          LADY

           I have a question... what exactly is

           "moral hazard?"

          With a smile...

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Short version -- taking risks you're

           not accountable for with other

           people's money.

          And the next person steps up and hands Gordon a copy.

                          JACOB

           He's going for it. We're almost home.

          As he signs it...

                          GORDON GEKKO

           There you go.

                          JACOB

           But he needs fresh money to serve the

           leverage. A hundred million.

          Gordon just shrugs.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           I'm a writer now. We don't make that

           much.

          As the line of people holding their new books start to get

          impatient...

                          JACOB

           I know that, but I figured you might

           know how to get it.

          Handing Jacob back the signed copy...

           105.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Well, if you need money that badly,

           Jake... you might want to check closer

           to home.

          Off Jacob's confused reaction...

          As they walk the mall... the Nation's Capitol behind them...

                          WINNIE

           It's a lot.

                          JACOB

           How much?

                          WINNIE

           I don't know, Jacob. I never really

           considered it mine.

                          JACOB

           But it is... right? It's your money?

          And she faces him... regarding his urgency...

                          WINNIE

           (glaring at him)

           You might want to wipe some of the

           drool off your face...

                          JACOB

           I'm not kidding. This is important.

          As they continue to walk...

                          WINNIE

           Yes, it's mine. When he went to

           prison, my father put a lot of money

           in our names. And when Rudy died it

           all became mine.

                          (BEAT)

           But it's in a trust. I can't get to

           it until I'm thirty-five and even then

           I was planning on giving it to

           charity.

                          JACOB

           Let's say I can figure out a way for

           you to get it. Take a loan against it

           -- something like that. Will you do

           that for me?

                          WINNIE

           Why are you doing this, Jacob?

          Jacob takes a moment... looking away with...

           106.

                          JACOB

           This is my only chance to make things

           right, Winnie.

          And she just regards him... not sure...

          INT. MILBANK,TWEED,HADLEY & MCCLOY LAW OFFICES - DAY

          As Jacob walks down the hall with KEN HADLEY, estate lawyer

          to Manhattan's elite.

                          HADLEY

           Gordon couldn't invest any of his

           money so he put most of it into the

           children's names with directions on

           how it was to be invested.

                          (BEAT)

           He definitely knew what he was

           doing...

                          JACOB

           And how could Winnie get it now?

          Hadley stops walking and thinks about it.

                          HADLEY

           Well, she'd have to sign a reversion

           of trust document. That way the funds

           would revert back to their pre-trust

           posture and regulations.

                          JACOB

           So all she has to do is sign a piece

           of paper?

                          HADLEY

           Basically.

          As that registers...

                          JACOB

           How much is in there?

                          HADLEY

           It's complicated. There's private

           equity ownership, real estate, a very

           large position in a bank... all sorts

           of investment vehicles.

                          JACOB

           Ballpark it for me.

                          HADLEY

           I don't know. Assuming immediate

           liquidity... over three hundred

           million.

          And with that, Jacob sets to go. But...

           107.

                          HADLEY (CONT'D)

           Of course... Gordon would have to sign

           the document as well.

          AND GORDON GEKKO

          In the make-up chair of the Fox Business channel green room,

          speaks into his phone.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           You also would need the trust's

           executor to sign it.

          INTERCUT WITH...

          Jacob as he walks down 5th avenue...

                          JACOB

           Who is that?

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Sammy Redding. He's a lifelong

           friend. It won't be a problem.

                          JACOB

           What about you?

                          GORDON GEKKO

           I would love to sign it, Jacob.

           Consider it done.

          Walking down 5th avenue...

                          JACOB

           Thank you. Thank you, Gordon.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Just after you agree to two things.

                          JACOB

           Anything.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Before Bretton buys the bank, he must

           use all of Winnie's money and all the

           Locust Fund's leverage to go against

           the market. They're about to pass

           this bailout and I want to be on the

           other side of it.

                          (BEAT)

           This thing's going to hell in a bucket

           and I'm sick of being on sidelines,

           Pal.

                          JACOB

           But what about--

                          GORDON GEKKO

           It's just for a few weeks then it's

           right back to our plan.

           108.

          Accepting that...

                          JACOB

           Okay.

                          (AND THEN)

           What's the second thing... ?

          And as that hangs...

                         WINNIE GEKKO

          As she starts to sign the forms... we're in...

          INT. MILBANK, TWEED, HADLEY & MCCLOY/CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          Silence. A clock ticks. A large table. Three LAWYERS sit

          on one side. Winnie and Jacob on the other and Gordon at the

          head.

          Winnie finishes signing the forms then slides them back to

          Hadley who hands them to Gordon.

          Jacob takes her hand but she pulls it away.

          And after Gordon signs the papers, they all stand.

          Gordon just looks at Winnie, who's now looking back at him.

          Tears beginning to well.

          And he slowly opens his arms...

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Winnie... come here... you're all I

           have left now.

          And she slowly walks over to him... to his embrace...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           He was my only son. And I messed that

           up. I messed it all up, I know that.

          She's now crying.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           But please... forgive me...

          And confirming through her tears...

                          WINNIE

           You always get what you want, Dad.

          And Jacob Moore... witnessing this strange reunion...

          realizing how right she is...

          INT. JACOB'S OFFICE - DAY

          Jacob's on the phone in his office, watching coverage of a

          vote on the Senate floor...

           109.

                          JACOB

           (into his phone)

           Okay, it looks like this bailout's

           going to pass...

          SPLIT THE SCREEN

          Robby, with a phone to his ear...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           (into his phone)

           ... there's going to be an initial

           bounce...

          SPLIT THE SCREEN AGAIN... AND AGAIN... AND AGAIN...

          Each time to another broker with a phone to their ear... our

          six brokers from before...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           (into his phone)

           We're going to sell that bounce.

          AND THEN FOX BUSINESS NEWS COVERAGE

          Day by day... Alexis Glick starting off the day's coverage.

          And each new day finds Alexis in a different outfit with a

          different headline above her head.

          We don't hear her, it moves quickly and it's ugly.

          "BAILOUT PASSED -- MARKET RALLIES"

           JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           First we're going to unload all of our

           positions in the insurers.

          "DOW REVERSES COURSE TRADES BELOW 10,000"

           JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           Then we're going to go the other

           way... we're going to bet against this

           market... aggressively.

          "DOW LOSES 2400 POINTS IN 4 SESSIONS

           left, all the froth from the last two

           years...

          AND WERE BACK ON THE CHART

          As a circle forms on October 10th then travels the trend line

          down even further to late October and stops.

           JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           Gentlemen, anything that can be

           sold... we're going to sell.

          And as a circle is formed around the date of October 27th,

          we...

                          CUT TO:

          INT. 533 THIRD AVENUE/LOBBY- MORNING

          Jacob gets off the elevator and sees Diego who doesn't say

          anything.

                          JACOB

           What? No market joke today?

          Diego just shrugs...

                          DIEGO

           It stopped being funny.

          Jacob softly nods and heads on his way.

          INT. JACOB'S OFFICE - DAY

          Jacob heads in to find Bretton waiting for him.

                          JACOB

           I thought you were in London.

          Jacob nods.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           The United Bancorp deal is going to go

           through. I've begun unwinding all our

           positions.

                          JACOB

           But our deal with Gordon was that we

           have to stay short until November 5th.

          Bretton just looks at him.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           What?

           111.

                          BRETTON WOODS

           Jacob, Gordon redeemed all his money

           yesterday. We're clean with him.

          And this hits Jacob like a ton of bricks...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

           Is something wrong?

                          JACOB

           No. No, everything's great.

          Forcing out a smile...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           Let's go buy a bank.

          INT. 655 PARK AVENUE/HALLWAY - NIGHT

          As the LANDLORD walks down the hall with Jacob and Winnie.

                          JACOB

           Thank you, he hasn't answered his

           phone and we're very worried.

          The landlord nods and unlocks the apartment door for them...

          INT. GEKKO'S APARTMENT - DAY

          And they walk in to find the place completely empty.

          Everything's gone save for one thing... that framed picture

          of the woman filling her stove with money.

          Jacob slowly walks over to the it and stares it down...

                          JACOB

           He played me...

          She joins his side...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           He played us.

                          WINNIE

           I don't give a shit about the money.

          And she turns to face him.

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)

           This is who he is.

          He sucks in a deep breath, then...

                          JACOB

           I lied to you. I contacted him. I

           spent time with him. Without you

           knowing.

           112.

                          WINNIE

           I knew.

                          JACOB

           You knew?

                          WINNIE

           I saw the picture in your wallet.

                          JACOB

           Then why didn't you say anything?

                          WINNIE

           Because I wanted to give you a chance

           to say something first.

                          (BEAT)

           Because I love you, I really do.

          She takes off the "fuck you" ring...

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)

           And because I desperately wanted to

           find something in you to believe in.

           (shaking her head in

                          DISAPPOINTMENT)

           But Jacob... you've become that exact

           thing I've been trying to master...

          ... and places it into his palm.

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)

           ... you've become him.

          INT. MILBANK, TWEED, HADLEY & MCCLOY OFFICES - MORNING

          Hadley sits behind his desk.

                          HADLEY

           It's completely legal, Jacob. The

           funds reverted back to the pre-trust

           posture... that means the money was

           technically Gordon's again.

          Hadley just shrugs...

                          JACOB

           But he's not allowed to trade.

                          HADLEY

           He didn't trade.

                          JACOB

           He put the money into the hedge fund,

           that's considered capital investment.

                          HADLEY

           Jacob, Gordon never put the money into

           a hedge fund. He simply took control

           of the bank.

           113.

                          JACOB

           Bank? What bank?

                          HADLEY

           Hudson River. I told you about the

           position in the bank.

          Jacob's stunned...

                          JACOB

           Hudson River... ? I don't understand.

          SLAM INTO/BUCHANAN NEW YORK

          A sleepy town...

           HADLEY (V.O.)

           Well, Gordon had placed his Hudson

           River shares into the trust before he

           was convicted. You do know he started

           out there?

          A rental car parks out front of a small bank. Jacob emerges

          and heads for the bank...

           HADLEY (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           Okay, then the trust aggressively

           acquired more shares about two years

           ago... enough to have a controlling

           position in the bank.

          And Jacob stops walking when he sees... a group of angry

          depositors forming outside and a sign hanging in the

          doorway... "Closed."

          AND RIGHT BACK TO

          Jacob and Hadley...

                          JACOB

           But how? Gordon wasn't allowed to

           control the trust.

                          HADLEY

           That's right. All of the trust's

           moves were made by its executor.

                          JACOB

           Sammy Redding?

          Confused...

                          HADLEY

           Sammy Redding? Who the hell is Sammy

           Redding?

                          (BEAT)

           Jacob, the executor of Winnie's trust

           has always been Bretton Woods.

          And as that slams into Jacob Moore...

           114.

          INT. BOEING 767 - NIGHT

          As Jacob takes his seat and settles in for the long flight.

          He's flying commercial... and in coach.

          EXT. LONDON - DAY

          It's raining and gray.

          INT. REDMAYNE AND BENTLEY BROKERAGE - DAY

          As Jacob walks the hallowed halls of this old school stock

          brokerage with the MANAGER...

                          JACOB

           So we're throwing Bretton's birthday

           party at Balmoral.

                          MANAGER

           Well, we're very proud to have such a

           resounding success hail from these

           hallowed halls I assure you.

                          (BEAT)

           We've been trying to get Bretton to

           come back and speak to our younger

           brokers, but... he's a hard man to

           reach.

                          JACOB

           That's funny because he often speaks

           about his days here at Redmayne and

           Bentley... anyway, what I'm hoping you

           can help me with were records of his

           early trades. Years ago.

                          (BEAT)

           We think it'll be fun to bring up some

           of Bretton's real losers from when he

           was starting out... you know we all

           have dogs.

                          MANAGER

           Of course... but it is against policy

           to allow just anyone to see those

           records.

                          JACOB

           I completely understand. How about

           this? I'll make you a trade.

                          (BEAT)

           You let me see the records for

           Bretton's party...

          And with a killer smile...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           ... and I'll make sure Bretton gives

           your young brokers a speech that will

           blow them away.

           115.

          INT. REDMAYNE AND BENTLEY BROKERAGE/RECORDS HALL - LATER

          As Jacob looks over the old documents... trading ledgers from

          twenty-five years ago.

          Down the list we see him circle all the unusually large

          successful trades. And then follow them to the client # on

          the right side of the ledger.

          And Jacob realizes it's the same client # every time. Client

          #41.

                          JACOB

           Wow, Bretton -- you really kicked some

           ass for client forty one.

          Finally Jacob turns to the back of the ledger, to the client

          key, where he moves the pencil down to client #41 and it

          says... Gordon Gekko.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           (all making sense now)

           Bud Fox wasn't the only one.

          INT. IMPRESSIVE TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

          Jacob waits in the large entry hall... holding a cheap

          umbrella he bought at Heathrow.

          And down from the stairs walks...

                          OLEG

           It's been a bitch of a month, my

           friend... tell me this visit does not

           bring bad news.

          INT. OLEG'S LIBRARY - NIGHT

          Oleg sips his vodka and looks at Jacob.

                          OLEG

           You want me to audit The Locust Fund?

                          JACOB

           That's right. I want you to tell

           Bretton you need the official records

           of all the fund's activity starting

           with when you gave him the original

           two hundred million. You need this

           because The Russian Federal Tax

           Service is up your ass and you have to

           play ball with them.

                          OLEG

           And if he declines... ?

                          JACOB

           You'll have no choice but to pull your

           money.

           116.

          Oleg lights a cigarette... exhaling the smoke with...

                          OLEG

           And why would I do that?

          And Jacob leans forward...

                          JACOB

           Because if you do this for me, Oleg,

           I'll teach you the Andrew Zabel magic.

           I'll explain to you, in detail, all of

           his techniques... I'll give you all

           his secrets... it's less complicated

           than you might think.

          INT. LONDON MOTEL ROOM - DAY

          Darkness, until... a phone rings. Jacob wakes up and takes

          it.

                          JACOB

           Hello... Okay, thank you.

          He moves to the curtains then opens them.

          And the daylight spills in.

          INT. OLEG'S LIBRARY - DAY

          Oleg slides four encyclopedia-sized bounded stacks of

          printouts across his desk.

                          OLEG

           All the Locust Fund's trades for the

           last two years.

          Jacob nods, placing them into his bag.

          And Oleg lights a cigarette... looks right at us...

          excited... leaning forward with...

                          OLEG (CONT'D)

           Now give it to me. Let me behind the

           Andrew Zabel curtain...

          INT. 767 - DAY

          As Jacob flies back to New York. He flips through the Locust

          Fund trading ledgers, shaking his head in disbelief.

          INT. WINNIE'S APARTMENT - MORNING

          Winnie answers the door to find...

                          JACOB

           They were working together. Your

           father and Bretton.

          Walking back into the apartment...

           117.

                          WINNIE

           Jacob, what are you doing here?

          Following her in...

                          JACOB

           Gordon wanted the trust the whole

           time. And when I came to him seeking

           revenge... he saw his window.

          Upset, she looks for her keys.

                          WINNIE

           I have to go to work.

                          JACOB

           Bretton owed him a favor because he

           fed your father information twenty

           three years ago when he was a young

           broker in London and your father never

           ratted him out.

          She just looks at him... shaking her head... and not in

          disapproval... but in pity. But he keeps going.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           And he never put the money into

           Bretton's fund. Turns out your trust

           had built up a controlling position in

           Hudson River Bank.

                          WINNIE

           That's the bank he worked at when I

           was born.

                          JACOB

           Well, now he owns it. Or shall I say

           pilfered it before he went AWOL.

                          (BEAT)

           And that money wasn't even the

           bank's... it was taxpayers'... bailout

           money.

          As this washes over a stunned Winnie Gekko...

                          WINNIE

           Jesus...

          And Jacob confirms...

                          JACOB

           He saw this coming years ago... from

           his cell. I'm guessing he made off

           with billions.

          And he throws something on the table.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           And now look?

           118.

          It's a copy of Portfolio Magazine with a picture of Gordon on

          cover under the headline... "Guess Who's Back and Getting

          Rich Betting Against You?"

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           He's in London... giving interviews

           and being hailed as a genius.

           Everyone's buying his book and waiting

           to see his next move.

          Desperately trying to get her mind around this...

                          WINNIE

           But what about the SEC, the regulatory

           agencies-- ?

                          JACOB

           The government is flying this 700

           billion dollar airplane by the seat of

           it's pants. They don't know where

           half of the fucking money is going.

           And even if they did, do you think

           they want this out there?

          As this all washes over her...

                          WINNIE

           This is his revenge.

                          JACOB

           Yup... sure beats the hell out of

           insider trading, doesn't it?

          And Winnie finds her keys and heads for the door...

                          WINNIE

           I can't hear anymore of this.

          ... but Jacob steps in front of her.

                          JACOB

           I'm done. I sold everything. The

           ring. Everything. I gave back the

           KZI bonus. I'm out and I'm broke and

           I deserve it.

          And she just looks at him...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           But Winnie, the one thing I can't

           accept -- is losing you.

          And before she reacts...

          WERE BACK ON THE CHART

          As a circle forms on Nov 6th then travels quite a ways then

          finally stops. Unfortunately, this slope down the S&P

          trendline is quite pronounced.

           119.

          And as a circle is formed around Jan 24th 2009, we...

                          CUT TO:

          THE CABIN OF A BOEING 777

          As Jacob opens up a copy of Barron's... Gekko on the cover

          under the caption "What's His Next Move?"

          AND BRETTON WOODS

          In an official office of our Federal Reserve Bank, proudly

          signing the documents...

          AND ALONG THE BANKS OF THE PERSIAN GULF

          Dubai in the background. Jacob waits against a bench.

          And across the way he sees... approaching him... Gordon

          Gekko.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Did you see Barrons?

                          JACOB

           You finally got the cover.

          Gordon nods.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           Everybody thinks you got rich of

           betting against the system. If they

           only knew...

                          GORDON GEKKO

           The powers that be will never let that

           happen.

          Jacob's not arguing it...

                          JACOB

           How much is enough, Gordon?

          Gordon laughs with a shake of the head.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           I've been asked that before...

                          (AND THEN)

           They took a hundred, twenty two

           thousand, six hundred and forty hours

           from me... for a goddamn victimless

           crime. All the while I sit in my 8 by

           12 and watch real crooks by the

           thousands give out mortgages like

           candy, package them into unexplainable

           derivatives and spit the cancer out

           into the world.

          And he just shakes his head...

           120.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           And when I get out... who's there

           waiting for me? Nobody.

                          (BEAT)

           You better believe I'm going to get

           mine.

                          JACOB

           You're not going to miss America?

                          GORDON GEKKO

           I'll always have America... it's why

           I'm here. I'm buying the island.

                          (BEAT)

           I know it's kitschy but it's fun and

           good for business.

          Looking over the water...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           I have a lot business abroad now.

           Interests in an Australian copper

           mine, a German solar company, some

           Russian oil pipelines, a casino in

           Macau... see Jake, America just isn't

           where the action is anymore.

                          JACOB

           What happened to the precious

           depreciating asset of time?

                          GORDON GEKKO

           It still trades...

          And he turns to Jacob with a smile...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           ... but I'm a billionaire now, Pal.

                          JACOB

           I'm out, Gordon, I'm done trading.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           I don't know why. You pulled it off,

           Kid, you took him down -- granted with

           my help -- but you atoned for Zabel's

           sins with Bretton's money.

                          (BEAT)

           As I see it, you're just getting

           started.

          And Jacob stops walking then slowly turns to Gordon with...

                          JACOB

           Did you ever really want to reconcile

           with her?

                          GORDON GEKKO

           (of course I did)

           I'm human.

           121.

          Glaring at him...

                          JACOB

           Then why did you do it?

          And Gordon... strongly holding Jacob's glare... simply

          replies...

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Same answer.

                          JACOB

           But it didn't work.

          Gordon sadly shrugs...

                          GORDON GEKKO

           I've been trying to wire two hundred

           million into her bank account but she

           won't accept it.

                          JACOB

           I know. She doesn't want it... we

           don't want it.

                          (BEAT)

           Because it's not about what you

           have... it's about what you do. And

           Gordon -- it's never about the money.

          Gordon shakes his head.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           That sounds good. I bet you can even

           wrap it in a pretty red bow. But

           Champ, it's idealistic... and idealism

           kills every trade.

                          (BEAT)

           Winnie will realize that at some

           point... and then we'll be fine.

          And Jacob finally looks away... in pity.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           See Jacob -- the hustle we all fall

           for is actually thinking we can fight

           what's inherent, what's inevitable...

           that we can somehow undo what

           genetics, or God, or whatever name you

           wanna tag it, has placed deep inside

           of us. Because whether it's greed or

           revenge or the compulsion to chase...

           it all amounts to the same thing...

           loss of control. And it's always

           going to be there and it's always

           going to be stronger than you, Pal.

          Now walking again...

           122.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           It's why bubbles will always exist and

           it's why we're all currently in this

           mess.

          Joining Gordon's stride...

                          JACOB

           Winnie's pregnant.

          And Gordon stops walking.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           It's going to be a boy.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           What do you want?

                          JACOB

           It's bad out there, Gordon, people are

           panicked. They're not looking to

           their government. They're not looking

           to their trusted advisors. They're

           looking to you.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           You want me to buy?

          And Jacob Moore... slowly confirming...

                          JACOB

           Publicly and aggressively.

          Gordon just looks at him.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           But they're all lemmings. Simple

           psychology. You once said every crash

           should have a JP Morgan to step in and

           save it.

                          (BEAT)

           Well Gordon -- this is your chance to

           be JP Morgan.

          And now Gordon shakes his head...

                          GORDON GEKKO

           We're far from the bottom. It'll be a

           dead cat bounce.

                          JACOB

           It'll buy us time. That's all I'm

           asking for... time.

                          (BEAT)

           Time for the new administration to put

           their plan into action.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           What do I get in return?

           123.

          As Gordon turns... takes in the city of Dubai... in all of

          its ridiculous splendor...

                          JACOB

           Full clemency.

                          GORDON GEKKO

           You can offer that?

                          JACOB

           Your daughter can. She works with the

           new Secretary of Treasury now.

          Considering that...

                          GORDON GEKKO

           What else?

                          JACOB

           Winnie. Me. Your grandson.

           Something money can't buy... a family.

          And Gordon looks at him for the longest moments, allowing it

          all to register, then...

                          GORDON GEKKO

           Sorry son -- that's simply a trade I

           cannot make.

          And as Gordon Gekko walks off... leaving Jacob Moore

          behind...

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           You wanna know what the mother of all

           bubbles was? Us. The human race.

           Scientists call it the Cambrian

           Explosion, from the Cambrian fauna.

          AND RONALD REAGAN NATIONAL AIRPORT

          As Jacob heads into the baggage claim area to see Winnie

          waiting for him...

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           It happened 530 million years ago...

           when all of the sudden, there was the

           seemingly rapid appearance of most

           major groups of complex animals.

          And as they embrace...

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           And from it was born humanity.

          AND GORDON GEKKO

          Being led through a massive empty space... office space...

           124.

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           It was an explosion of life.

           Scientists will tell you it was

           unprecedented, excessive and by the

           standards of evolution-time...

           happened in a flash.

          The City of London outside the large windows...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           Suddenly the world had millions of new

           species... just like that.

          This will be the home of his new international empire.

          AND BRETTON WOODS

          At his desk in his 15 CPW penthouse...

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           See -- bubbles are the purest form of

           Darwinism.

          ... looking over pages and pages of destruction... Andrew

          Zabel's legacy that he now has to pay for...

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           They teach us what we didn't know and

           they remind us of what we forgot...

          And Bretton completely loses it... just starts ripping out

          the pages then tearing them in two...

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           They kill excess and they lean out the

           herd.

          ... methodically... page by page... over and over again...

          AND GORDON GEKKO

          Sitting in his massive London office.

          It's empty. It's night. He's completely alone.

          He looks up at the wall... at the framed picture of JP Morgan

          and Uncle Sam rowing that boat.

          Then he looks down at an old picture of Winnie... she's

          probably three or four years old... and lovingly holding her

          baby brother, Rudy.

          And Gordon holds on this picture for a long moment, before

          finally...

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           They actually bring us back to the

           necessary simple...

           125.

          ... picking up the phone.

          AND GORDON GEKKO

          Now in the back of a Town Car... we don't know where...

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           Because Jacob...

          As the door opens, daylight spills in and we see the charging

          bull of Bowling Green Park across the way...

          Gordon is escorted out of the car and led to the doors of the

          New York stock exchange.

          And Gordon stops at the famed doors, takes a moment to regard

          the exchange, sucks in a deep breath, readies for his hero's

          welcome and finally... opens the doors then disappears

          inside.

          AND WINNIE AND JACOB

          Greet the morning in their small Washington DC apartment.

          Winnie pouring coffee, Jacob turning on the TV.

          And on the screen is a picture of Gordon Gekko walking the

          floor of the New York stock exchange under the graphic...

          "Gekko Now Betting On A Recovery."

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

           ... you'd be amazed what can rise from

           the ashes.

          Sam Cooke's "A Change Is Gonna Come" kicks in.

          And we go close on the Fox Business Channel's coverage of the

          market's huge rally of an opening... with Gordon Gekko

          ringing the bell... until the channel suddenly changes... to

          the cartoon network... while we...

           FADE OUT.
