          ON A BLACK SCREEN, THE FOLLOWING CRAWL:

          MOSCOW, 17 JULY 1991. THE KREMLIN

          ANNOUNCED THE 'RETIREMENT' OF

          MIKAHIL, GORBACHEV AS WELL AS

          POLITBURO MEMBERS YAVOLEV,

          MENDVENDEV AND BIRKOVO.

          THE ROLE OF CHAIRMAN. KGB HEAD

          "A RESTORATION OF DISCIPLINE."

          WESTERN LEADERS BRACED FOR

          A NEW ROUND OF COLD WAR.

          FOUR MONTHS LATER...   

                         FADE IN

          A BARREN LANDSCAPE

          beneath slate-grey sky. Frigid rock and stunted trees fall to an

          ice-choked coast. Congealed sea on a desolate beach.

          MARKO ALEXANDROVICH RAMIUS

          bare-headed in cold wind, studies the inclement coast. Bottomless

          eyes move slowly across the landscape, missing nothing.

          SUPER: POLWARNY INLET

          Soviet Submarine Base on the Barents Sea

          500 mi north of Murmansk

          Ramius wears a tar black winter uniform of Captain First Rank in

          the Soviet Navy. Behind him, out of sight, someone SPEAKS:

                         VOICE (OS)

          Cold this morning, Captain.

          Ramius shivers. When he replies, he speaks not about the weather,

          but of the land:

                         RAMIUS

          It is cold.

                         (BEAT)-

          And hard.

          Turning his back on the icy coast, Ramius smi-I fondly at the man

          who just spoke to him

          CAPTAIN SECOND., RANK VASILY BORODIN

          Ramius' executive officer, also in black uniform. Borodin's rigged

          with a mike. , Brass .buttons gambol in his Nubian cap like money.

                         RAMIUS (CONT'D)

          e your head a bit. No need to

          crowd him.

                         BORODIN

                         (INTO MIKE)

          Come left three degrees. Make your

          course three-four-zero. Sonar, let

          me know when we pass fifty, fathoms.

          A HELMSMAN responds on a SPEAKER in the SAIL. Nautical CROSS

          TALK. Orders GIVEN and AFFIRMED. Pulling back, Ramius and

          Borodin are revealed standing atop

          THE RED OCTOBER

          a huge submarine, trading a gigantic rudder a hundred yards aft

          her sail. A patrol BOAT and ICEBREAKER escort her to sea. On

          SPEAKERS in the SAIL:

          Granted.

                         BORODIN

          (under his breath)

          Think of it, Comrade.. .son of only a

          humble mM worker...

                         RAMIUS

          block-faced, forties, pink-necked, political officer assigned to Red

          October, clambers through the hatch into the air, wheezing:

                         PUTIN

          Ah,, Captain, every time I climb that

          ladder, I realize what an over-fed

          ox rve become.

          Put in smiles. Ramius smiles back, but his eyes are cold. Suddenly,

          there's not a lot of Lave on the bridge:

                         PUTIN (CONT'D)

                         (EXPANSIVELY)

          father was only a mill. worker. Think

          of it, comrades, a mill worker.

          Borodin CHUCKLES. Putin stares at him. Borodin covers with a

          COUGH. Putin keeps starring. Flushed, Borodin looks away. Putin

          turns porcine eyes on Ramius:

                         PUTIN (CONT'D)

                         (TURNING)

          You know he was.

                         PU TIN

          nothing like him. Pefmisrdon to go

          below?

          Smirking, Putin leaves. Ramius watches him go. SPEAKERS in the

          St M dealing with Putin's exit, Ramius turns away from the hatch,

          contemplating the shore. After a beat, softly:.

          Ramius and. Borodin disappear. Red October prepares to dive. All

          that remains is icy .sea and the Sand. Then, faintly at first, from

          the frozen coast:

          A RED ARMY CHORUS

          rises into the swirling sky. It seems to come from everywhere, the

          rocks, the trees, the sea itself. Red October dives. The screen

          fades to black and a giant title appears:

          CHORUS BOOMS. Male VOICES ring in thundering tribute to the

                         A LITHOGRAPH

          of John Paul Jones fighting the Serapis appears. It's on the wall. in

          and nautical memorabilia, everywhere.

          THROUGH A WINDOW

          an English suburb in drizzling rain. Red Army CHORUS SINGS

          SOFTLY. In a driveway, a late model ROVER waits, lights on,

          engine running. At a messy desk

                         JACK RYAN

          early-thirties, good-Looking, disheveled and harried, stuffs papers

          into a brief case. Slamming it shut, he reaches for his raincoat.

                         BEHIND HIM

          A LITTLE GIRL

          appears in the doorway. Her name is Sally. She's Ryan's

          daughter. Wearing a nightgown with butterflies on it, she's

          carrying a well-worn Koala bear:

                         SALLY

          Daddy?

                         RYAN

                         (TURNING)

          Hey.., What are you doing up?

          You're suppose to be sleeping.

                         SALLY

          I can't.

          Kneeing beside: her, Ryan talks in a steady unpatronizing way. He

          loves her to death:

                         RYAN

          What's the matter?

                         SALLY

          Where are you going?

                         RYAN

          I have to go on a business trip and you

          have to go to sleep or when you grow up

          you'll only be two inches tall.

                         SALLY

          Stanley keeps waking me up.

          Stanley is Sally's bear. Ryan talks to it like it was alive.

          it makes Sally grin.

                         RYAN

          What's the matter, Stanley? Are you

          nuts or something?

                         SALLY

          He's not, nuts. He's lonely.

                         (SLYLY)

          He needs a brother. If he had a brother

          then he could go to sleep better.

          Before Ryan can answer, a ravishing woman in her ..late-twenties

          marches into the study. She is

                         MARGARET RYAN

          English, intelligent features, in tweed suit and raincoat. A matronly

          woman hovers in the doorway behind her:

                         MARGARET

          We are never going to make it.

          Daddy has to go, cricket. You and

          Stanley go upstairs with Mrs. Wheeler

          and go straight to sleep. When I'm

          away, I'll see if I can find Stanley

          a brother.

          One of yours?

                         RYAN

          Yes, sir. I did the bio on him last

          year. He's taken out the lead boat in

          each new sub class for ten years. Fairly

          good political connections. He's also

          trained most of their attack boat skippers.

          They can him the Vilnius schoolmaster.

          Greer studies one of the photos with a magnifying glass. Something

          captures his attention:

          What are these doors?

                         RYAN

          The doors, Admiral, are the problem.

          I don't know what they are and neither

          do the English.

          He was Captain on an attack boat. Got

          clipped by a drunk driver and lost a leg.

          Now he's teaching at the Academy and

          doing some consulting for Underwater

          Right now if it's OX with you? 've.

          never met him personally, but -

                         GREER

          Ryan retrieves his photographs. Getting Up, Greer watches him,

          choosing his words carefully:

          eardrums.

          The black screen is moving. A massive cylinder glides over the top

          SEAMAN CHARLES BEAUMONT

          mammal that knows a fuck of a lot more

          about sonar than you do.

          Beaumont frowns. Appearing in the sonar shack door, directly

                         BEHIND JONES

                         THE COB

          Chief of the Boat, a barrel-chested bear, smiles at Beaumont:

          He gets to raggin you too bad, kid,

          you can always ask him about Pavarattt..

          Jones sinks into his chair. Beaumont grins. Sea story coming.

          From the look on Jones' face, it promises to be a good one:

                         BEAUMONT

          Tell me, Chief.

                         COB

          (taking his time)

          Well, Jonesy here, he's a music freak,

          right? And he figures this sonar system

          is basically just a big old 300 million

          ddllar stereo unit. So he gets this

          piece of Pavarmt3i --

                         JONES

          it was Paganini.

                         COB

          Whatever. It's this piece of music he

          likes so much he wants to share it,

          right? So he re-wires the computer and

          figures how to put it in the water with

          a gigawatt of juice behind it.

                         (BEAT)

          Now, the Captain, he don't much care.

          starts hearing Pavarotti Doming out their

                         (LAUGHING)

          And all of a sudden we got an Admiral

          Beaumont's LAUGHS. Even Jones sm Ies. Then, a flashing light on

          the. sonar display catches his eye. He starts flipping switches.

          Beaumont sobers:: up:

                         BEAUMONT

          What should I --

                         JONES

          Be sti 1, I got it.

          Jones works in silence, then punches the intervom:

                         JONES

          Distant contact, submerged bearing zero-

          nine-seven. It's a wild guess, but I'd

          say we had a Boomer headed out of the barn.

          IN THE COMMAND CENTER

          forward of sonar, sailers drive the ship beneath a maze of pipes and

          equipment. At the center of the Conn, surrounded by fire control,

          quartermaster, helm :

          CAPTAIN BARTOLOMO MANCUSO

          skipper of the DaZa, early-forties, muscular body encased in a blue

          jumpsuit, works the intercom on the periscope plat6arm:

                         MANCUSO

          Start a plot, Jonesy. IM be there

          in a second.

          Leaving the deck, Mancuso glances at his executive offker

          LIEUTENANT PHIL THOMPSON

          thirties, dark complected, standing at fire control:

                         MANCUSO (CONT'D)

          I'91 be in sonar, PhiL

                         IN SONAR

          Jones is already working on the plot. In font of him on the sonar

          display, the flashing light is starting to move. Mancuso sticks his

          head in.

                         MANCUSO

          What do you have?

                         CUT TO:

                         RAMIUS

          in Red October's Conn. Much larger than the control center on the

          Dallas. Leaving the deck, Ramius heads aft, glancing at Borodin:

                         RAMIUS

          When you see Putin, tell him that when

          it's convenient, 191 be in my stateroom.

          Leaving the Conn, Ramius enters

                         A HALLWAY

          Moving past a radio compartment on his left, Ramius stops at a door,

                         ENTERING THE

                         CAPTAIN'S STATEROOM

          C3osing the door behind him, Ramius turns into the room.

          Surprised, he sees

                         PU TIN

          seated at a desk, reading a bible. Startled, Putin looks up:

                         RAMIUS

          What are you doing?

                         PT TIN

          It's my responsibility to oversee the

          stability of the crew, Captain. You

          know that.

                         RAMIUS

          And you accomplish this by searching

          through my papers and invading my

          privacy?

                         PUTIN

          There is no such thing as privacy in

          the Soviet Union, Comrade. It's

          antithetical to the oal]ective good.

          Suppressing his anger, Ramius moves to a locker, changing into

          dungarees. He can fiee]. Putin's weasel eyes crawling up and down

          his back. Holding the bible, Put in muses:

                         PUTIN (CONT'D)

          You. surprise me, Captain. A man in your

          Did you underline these passages?

                         RAMIUS

          The book belonged to my wife. I

          keep it only for sentimental value.

                         PUTIN

          Your wife was a beautiful woman. A

          tragedy her life was cut so short.

                         RAMIUS

                         (TURNING)

          I assure you, Comrade. There's

          nothing wrong with my mind.

                         PUTIN

          (trying to joke)

          Given the amount of fire power on Red

          October, I'm sure the whole world will.

          breathe a cm1 eotive sigh of relief.

                         RAMIUS

                         (LKE ICE)

          How many more agents does the KGB

          have on my boat?

                         PUTIN

                         (STANDING)

          Captain, this is not your boat. It

          belongs to the Union of the Soviet

          Socialist Republics. You would be

          well advised to remember that.

                         (RAMIUS BLANCHES)

          Anyway, I am only a political odfioer.

          If the KGB has an agent on board,

          I would be the last to know.

                         RAMIUS

          I suggest we open our orders.

                         PUTIN

          As you wish.

          There's a safe on the wall. Ramius spins the combination. Inside,

          another safe with four locks. Both Ramius and Putin have keys.

          Inside the second safe, a large envelope.

          it has an ornate. scarlet seal, marked 'Top Secret'. Ramius cracks

          the seeal, removing four pages of operation orders. Glancing at

          Putin; he reads:

                         RAMIUS

          We are to proceed to grid 54-90 and

          rendezvous with the Akula submarine,

          Konovalov.

                         PUTIN

          Captain Tupalev's boat.

                         RAMIUS

          You know Tupolav?

                         PU TIN

          I know that he is descended from a long

          line of aril rats and that he was a

          student of yours. it is rumored, he

          has no love in his heart for you. Why

          is that?

          Ramius pours two cups of steaming tea from a silver pot on a

          serving tray, offering it to Putin.. Putin takes the cup.

                         RAMIUS

          There is no room in Tupolev's heart

          for anyone or anything except Tupolev.

                         (READING)

          Having made contact, we are ordered

          to run a series of drfl1 . Tupolev

          w2l hunt us while we test our ship.

          Putting down his tea, Putin stands, suddenly formal, awkwardly

                         OBSEQUIOUS:

                         PUTIN

          Captain, this is an historic moment

          for all. of us. I should like to make

          a request.

                         RAMIUS

          Before you do, I want to talk to you

          about something important.

                         PUTIN

                         (NOT HEARING)

          I know that it is not aooording to

          protocxrl, but would you permit me to

          post the orders and inform the crew

          of our mission?

                         RAMIUS

                         (RESIGNED)

          As you wash, Comrade.

          Putin grins, heading for the door. He never makes it. In a sudden

          violent motion,, Ramius kicks Putin's left leg from under him.

          Surprised, the; big man tumbles sideways.

          Leaping to his feet, Ramius catches Putin, slamming him into a

          headlock, driving his thick neck downward, CRACKING his SKULL

          in the SHARP corner of the DESK.

          Putin gags. Cupping his chin, Ramius forces his entire bulk onto

          the man's chest. Putin struggles. His eyes bulge. Ramius strains,

          using all of his strength until..

          PUTIN'S NECK SHATTERS

          and his face goes slack. With surprising gentleness, Ramius lowers

          the shuddering body to the deck. Carefully, he checks the pulse in

          Putin's neck. Dying, Putin stares into Ramius' face.

                         RAMIUS (CONT'D)

          I an sorry my friend. But it is

          cyear to me now. Where I would

          walk, you cannot fallow.

          Whatever his destination, Putin's on his way. Getting up, Ramius

          goes to the desk. Returning with the teapot, he drenches the body

          with scalding tea.

          Replacing the pot on the tray, Ramius puts the orders in a

          wastebasket and sets them on are. Removing a duplicate set of

          orders from his safe, he' places them on the floor by the dead man.

          Satisfied everything is the way he wants it, he moves to an intercom

          and takes a deep breath. Pushing a button, he BELLOWS:

          Jones is starting to sweat. He runs his tests. Nothing. urning,

          he stares blankly at Mancuso:

                         JONES (CONT'D)

          Sonar is working, sir. The Russian

          just disappeared. One minute he was

          steady four thousand yards off our

          bow and then he was gone. And r

          To what purpose?

                         BONAVIA

          To inform them Red October has not

          appeared.

                         TUPOLEV

          What makes you think she hasn't?

          Tupolev glides to a quartermaster's station. Following him,

          Bonavia's stomach growls.

                         TUPOLEV

          Has it occurred to you that Red October

          may already be in position? That Ramius

          is merely hiding behind his silent drive?

          Waiting for me to break radio silence

          and make a fool of myself?

                         BONAVIA

          I will not break radio silence. We

          wilt lie here quietly for a few more

          hours. If Ramius hasn't arrived by

          then, I'll contact Red Fleet Command.

                         BONAVIA

          Captain, I am concerned that -

                         TUPOLEV

          I Care little for your concerns, Comrade.

          Tupolev leaves. Bonavia glances at the quartermaster. His stomach

          Padorin lights a morning cigarette. The orderly brings tea things

          Mancuso at the door. Beaumont is at his station next to Jones.

          Wearing a headset, Jones concentrates on his sonar display.

          Suddenly, he rips the headset off:

                         JONES

          Jesus Christ. Somebody just stepped on

          the gas.

          THE WHITE HOUSE

          in the background as Ryan springs from his car, racing up the

          steps to the Executive Office Building. At the top of the stairs,

          waiting for him, Greer is already in motion:

                         GREER

          Come on.

          Ryan follows him past a security guard and into

                         A LOBBY

          decorated with secretaries and suits, all, in quiet motion. At speed,

          I got a line on the doors. You

          know what they are?

          He hands Ryan a sheaf of message flimsies. The descending elevator

          stops. Doors open. Ryan reads. Greer leaves. Realizing he's

          been left behind, Ryan takes off, entering

          A SUBTERRANEAN CORRIDOR

          Reading and walking, Ryan does his best to keep up with Greer:

          Look. No one knows this material better

          than you do. Give him a rundown on the

          Ryan takes a deep breath.

          JUMP CUT TO:

          RYAN FOLLOWING GREER

          into the White House Briefing Room. Joint Chiefs are gathered

          around a thirty foot conference table. Greer introduces Ryan to a

          GENERAL and an ADMIRAL, then mingles.

          Left alone, Ryan spot, a lectern at the foot of the tabl. Nearby, a

          yeoman tends a slide machine, an overhead projector and a large

          bulletin board. Ryan heads for the lectern.

          The yeoman has a list of slides, some photos and mustrations.

          Trying to gather his thoughts, Ryan steps behind the lectern.

          Let's get started.

                         GREER

          Yes, sir. The preliminary briefing

          today w M be handled by Dr. Jack Ryan.

          You may begin.

                         RYAN

          Gentlemen, the last twenty four hours

          have seen some extraordinary Soviet

          naval activity. The first to sail was --

                         (SLIDE)

          this ship, the Red October. A variant

          of the typhoon class, she's some six

          hundred fifty feet long. Thirty-two

          thousand tons submerged displacement,

          roughly the size of a World War II

          aircraft Carrier.

                         (BEAT)

          Unlike the standard typhoon, equipped

          to fire long-range missiles from Russian

          waters, Red October carries fifty-six

          SS-311s, which is a short-range attack

          mis it with eight independent warheads.

          That's four hundred forty-eight warheads

          all spedfically designed to fire close in.

                         (ANOTHER SLIDE)

          We believe these doors on the bow, and

          here again on the stern, enclose a

          magneto-hydrodynamic drive, or caterpillar,

          which may allow the sub to run totally

          silent.

                         (ANOTHER SLIDE)

          it is possible this new drive system

          allowed the captain, a man named Marko

                         RAMIUS -

          Ryan points out two photos on a bulletin board. One is of Ramius

          alone. The other is a wedding photo of Ramius and a beautiful

          woman.

                         RYAN (CONT'D)

          to elude one of ' our attack boats,

          the Dallas, which trailed Red October

          f r om harbor this morning.

                         (POINTKUY)

          This drive, if it's working, could

          render Red October invvsihl8 to our

          SOSUS warning nets in the Atlantic.

                         PELT

          You would characterize this as a first

          Ryan glances at Greer. Greer smi reassuringly.

          There's no doubt about that, sir. She

          is designed to approach by stealth, and

          fire on a target with little or no warning.

          Precisely, Admiral..

          if I may continue. Shortly after the

          Dallas lost contact, there were additional

          Soviet mailings from Pa tjarny, Leningrad

          and the Mediterranean. The Soviets have

                         SOME --

          fifty-eight nuclei submarines headed at

          high speed into the Atlantic. And this

          afternoon's satellite pass over Policjarny

          found head blooms in the engineering plants

          of the Kirov, the Minsk and more than

          twenty cruisers and destroyers,, indicating

          that the bulk of their surface fleet is

          also preparing to sail.

          Flushed, Ryan sits beside Greer. Pelt turns to Greer:

                         PELT

          Conclusions?

                         GREER

          Absence of activity in the Pacific suggest

          this is probably just an exercise having

          nothing to do with the Red October.

          A General starts to object. He's cut off by JUDGE MOORE, a

          white-haired civilian near the top of the table:

                         MOORE

          NSA can speak to that, Mr. Pelt.

          I must emphasize the extremi ' sensitivity

                         (PELT NODS)

          Before sailing, Captain Ramius sent a

          letter to Admiral Yuri Padorin, Chairman

          of Soviet Naval Deployment.

          Painting at Ramius' wedding picture, Ryan whispers to Greer:

                         RYAN

          That's her uncle!

                         GREER

          Whose uncle?

                         (WHISPEG)

          Ramius' wife. Padorin's her uncle!

          Greer has no idea what Ryan's saying. Moore's still talking:

                         MOORE

          The contents of the letter are unknown,

          but Admiral Padorin immediately demanded

          a meeting with Premier Ligachev and

          within minutes of that meeting, the

          Soviet Fleet sailed with orders to find

          Red October --

          And sink her.

          Audible intake of breath round the room. Pelt is the first to

                         RECOVER:

                         PELT

          My god. They've got a madman on

          their hands. He's gonna start a war.

          A spirited discussion ensues. Tuning it out, Ryan stares at the

          picture of Ramius and his wife. Urgently, he whispers to Greer:

                         RYAN

          This is the twenty-gird, isn't it?

          Greer nods. Order in the room has broken down. Generals and

          Admirals argue vehemently about appropriate. responses. Staring at

          the photos, a light goes off in Ryan's brain:

          SljenCel. Ryan realizes everyone in the room is staring at him.

          Uhhmm...I was just thinking there

          was perhaps another possibility we

          ought to consider.

          Ryan takes a deep breath.

                         RYAN (CONT'D)

          Ramius might be trying to defect.

          Nobody moves. Ryan glances at Greer. Greer rolls his eyes. Too

          far out. Ryan's on his own. The.General bristles:

          Well, Ramius trained most of their Officer

          Corps. He'd be in a position to sect

          men willing to help him. And he's not

          Russian.

                         JESUS --

          shaking his head, Greer pats Ryan's shoulder and leaves. Ryan's

          You heard the Captain. Dismissed!

          One by one, the men file out of the wardroom. When they are gone,

          SHOUTING SAILORS batten down the plane.

          A door opens. Ryan climbs down a ramp on shaky legs. Taking his

          arm, Davenport SHOUTS:

          Charles Davenport, commanding officer

          of the Kennedy! The Admiral is

          You gonna tell me what all this activity

          is about?

          Ryan hands Painter a lettew. Opening It, Painter studies the

                         -47-

          contents. Davenport leans on a bulkhead, staring at Ryan. Painter

          returns the letter:

                         JONES

          at a translucent status board in the quartermaster's station on the

          Dalla. Behind the status board, projected on a screen, a nautical

          map of the North Atlantic. Mancuso and Thompson enter.

                         JONES

                         (TO MANCUSO)

          I know you're busy, Captain. But I

          may have something here.

                         MANCUSO

          Go ahead.

                         JONES

          I've been working on a sound I heard

          when the typhoon disappeared. I washed

          it through the tape machine several times

          and managed to isolate it. But when I

          asked the computer to identify it, the

          answer I got. was magma displacement.

                         MANCUSO

          Magma displacement?

                         JONES

          Yes sir. See, the system we are

          using was originally- designed to look

          four seismic events and although we

          adapted it. to hunt for submarines -

                         MANCUSO

          utto the chase, Jonesy._:.,

                         JONES

          Aye, aye, sir. Anyway,; I got curious,

          and. started tracking. the sound on our

          lateral array. I located it four

          different times. The fifth time it

          was gone and I couldn't find it. But

          I want to show you what I worked up.

          Picking up a grease pencil, Jones makes calculations on the status

          board overlaying the nautical map:

                         -48-

                         JONES (CONT'D)

          The first contact was at zero-nine-Been

          hours and the bearing was two-six-nine.

                         (DRAWING LINE)

          Then at zero-nine-thirty hours it was

          bearing two-six-zero. And at zero-nine-

          forty-eight is was two-ive-zero.

                         (ANOTHER LINE)

          I came back to it at about ten-hundred

          and the bearing was two-four-two. The

          last signal was real faint and I didn't

          have a very good lock on it.

                         MANCUSO

          So?

                         JONES

          Well, I figure it couldn't be very far

          away from us, right? Let's say it was

          halfway between us and Iceland. That

          would put it on a course like this.

          Jones makes more calculations on the. status board. Mancuso

          recognizes a pattern:

                         MANCUSO

          Headed directly into Red Route One.

                         JONES

          Exactly. Sir, I believe the sound I

          heard is the acoustical signature of some

          kind of super-quiet Russian submarine and

          he's taking the inshore track off the

          Iceland coast.

                         THOMPSON

          What do you think, captain?

          Mancuso stares-at the status board, then turns to Jones:

                         MANCUSO

          Let me see if I got this straight. The

          three minion dollar computer tells you

          you're chasing after an earthquake and

          you aren't convinced. So you get curious

          and came up with this theory: on your own?

                         JONES

                         (UNCERTAIN)

          Yes, sir.

                         MANCUSO

          Relax, Jonesy. You sold me.

          Jones grans.

                         MANCUSO (CONT'D)

          Let me ask you this. If we get close

          to this supers lent sub again, you

          think you can track him down?

                         JONES

          Yes, sir. Now that I know what to

          listen for, I'1 bag the sucker cold.

          For the sake of argument, let's assume

          you're right and Ramius intends to defect.

          What are you gonna do with the boat?

          You cant keep it. The Russians will.

          want it back. And theyRl know you've got

          IN THE SKY

          the Foxtrot levels off. Bomb bay doors inch open, revealing a

          torpedo, sixteen inches in diameter and eight feet long. As the

          plane's nose dips, the torpedo relaasee.

          parachute opening behind, a thousand pounds of doomsday device

          dive earthward at dizzying speed, splashing into choppy sea.

          Beaumont grins. The C O 8 and Jones are everything he hoped the

          Navy would be:

                         (M AY)

          What Hustler magazine?

                         JONES

          For many months, seaman Beaumont,

          there was a Hustler magazine located

          in the crew's head. it was community

          property.

                         (WORKING SONAR)

          Then one day, it disappeared. The

          ..COB. here was the last person seen

          entering the head before it vanished.

                         BEAUMONT

          Where'd it' go?

                         COB

                         (SQUIRMING)

          Come on, Jonesy.

                         JONES

          I have a theory, seaman Beaumont.

          I believe the CO B Is like a black

          widow, spider. After he has sex

          with a magazine, he eats it.

          Beaumont HOWLS. The COB turns pink.

                         -65-

                         COS

          Jones the tunes a dial. In the distance, barely di i nguishahle

          through transient NOISE, the sound of RUSTLING WATER followed

          by a fleeting HUM.

                         CUT TO:

                         PAINTER

          Leaning over a status board in the Combat Information Center on the

          Kennedy. Replete with lights, the status board reveals details of

          force deployment. Ryan enters, carrying copse:

                         RYAN

          Morning, Admiral.

                         PAINTER

          Our friends have been busy.

                         PAINTER

          During the night, they positioned most

          of their front line submarines at barrier

          stations between Greenland and Iceland.

          Here, here and here.

                         (PIG)

          The majority of their Northern Fleet

          surface vessels are moving in a line

          abreast through here.

                         (BEAT)

          It's an old anti submaxlne tactic. Like

          beaters in the jungle making a lot of

          noise, driving the prey into the guns

          of waiting hunters.

                         (PIG)

          One of our submarines, the Da71as, reports

          intermittent contact with Red October and

          is positioned here at the bottom of Red

          Route One. With luck, the Dallas will

          inte pt her.

                         RYAN

          Could you get me aboard the Dallas?

                         -66-

                         PAINTER

          We could fly you out there in a helicopter.

          But I don't think you'd like that much.

                         RYAN-

          No other way?

                         PAINTER

          That's all there is, I'm afraid.

          Putting down his coffee cup, Ryan stares at the status board. A

          sal]ci r arrives with a message. Reading it, Painter glances at Ryan:

                         PAINTER (CONT'D)

          DaIlas found Red October and is

          backing her now.

          Locking eyes with Painter, Ryan grits his teeth.

                         (BEAT)

          Your average skipper might get caught

          We stop all engines and turn with him.

          Staying in his baffles. Quiet as a mouse.

          Beaumont frowns. Seconds pass. Working his equipment, Jones

          The Dallas picked up Red October and

          Ryan, listen to me. Getting someone

          Ryan's back.

          Ryan peers down. Wind from the rotors crushes the waves.

          Between his feet, Ryan can see the small white wake from a

          periscope.

          ON THE DALLAS

          in the Conn, Mancuso spins the scope. Thompson watches him.

          Both he and Mancuso wear life jackets:

          A flurry of activity in the Conn. The Dallas prepares to surface.

          Mancuso and Thompson move to a hatch by the helm.

          IN THE CHOPPER

          the saftors i nish strapping Ryan into the sling. One of them leans

          forward, painting to a ]ever on Ryan's chest, SHOUTING:

          Pull this to release!

          Fighting. panic, Ryan glances down. A mitlion miles below, the sea

          ON THE DALLAS

          sail in the Conn work like lightning in cramped quarters. A

          petty afa'lcer straps Mancuso and Thompson into harnesses.

                         MANCUSO

          You got a man dangling at the end of

          a line with no paint of reference and

          helicopter rotors generating enough

          static electak ty that we have to

          a hot wire and if he falls in the water

          the only way to get him out is with divers

          Why I joined the Navy.

          A sager hands Mancuso a phone for the bridge.

                         THOMPSON (CONT'D)

          I put Jonesy in the forward escape

          hatch in case he goes in the drink.

                         MANCUSO

          Good. We got no idea who this guy

          is or why the Navy wants his on

          our boat so bad.

          IN THE CHOPPER

          Teeth chattering, sta:ugg g with deja vu, Ryan is transfixed by, the

          sub-zero ocean. HOWLING WIND and CRASHING ROTORS. Eyes

          wide, he watches

          THE DALLAS RISE

          First the sail, then the foredeck EXPLODE high into the air, finally

          CRASHING back to the WATER.

          ON THE DALLAS

          The COB helps Jones climb into an escape trunk aft of the sail. It's

          cramped and brightly lit. Jones checks his equipment.

          IN THE CHOPPER

          Ryan watches Mancuso and Thompson climb out of the sail onto the

          lurching bridge.The sailer leans close, HOLLERING:

                         SAILOR

          Hang on!

          He trips a laver on the winch. Cable feeds out a few feet Holding

          his breath, Ryan inches into the abyss.

          ON THE BRIDGE

          Mancuso lays binoculars on Ryan. Thompson ties both of them to

          the sail The sub pitches and rolls. Forward and aft are buried

          beneath waves.

          Fingers freezing, Thompson clamps one end of a jumper cable to a

          metal lip on the bridge to ground the sub against static generated

          by the helicopter's rut

          IN THE AIR

          savage WINDS from the chopper's ROTORS start spinning Ryan like

          a top. Desperately, he trams to control the dizzying motion.

          Above, caught in an unexpected wind sheer, the chopper plummets

          seaward. Ryan's line goes slack. Angry sea rushes up at him with

          blistering speed.

          IN THE CHOPPER

          the pilot struggles for control. Behind him, loose equipment SLAMS

          into the WINCH, JAMMING the CABLE. CURSING, the pilot regains

          control. The chopper stabilizes.

          IN THE AIR

          CRACKING like a WHIP, the CABLE goes TAUT. Ryan feels like

          he's been hit with a sledgehammer. Unable to breathe, he RIPS off

          his HELMET.

          A rock in a sling, he tries to get his bearings. Everything's grey.

          Above, the chopper's rotors CHEW the SKY. Help] s, Ryan starts

          swinging like a pendulum.

          ON THE BRIDGE

          Mancuso and Thompson watch Ryan rocket by at Mach 10. A huge

          arc carries him way out over the angry sea. Slowing down, Ryan

          starts to spin again.

                         MANCUSO

                         (SCREAMING)

          See if you can get a ground on his line.

          I'm gonna try and catch the bastard!

          Way out on the horizon, Ryan reaches the end of his arc and starts

          a comet-like ride back at the ship.

          IN THE CROPPER

          the pilot FEATHERS. CONTROLS trying to reduce Ryan's

          mind-boggling-ride. over his shoulder, he BELLOWS:

                         PILOT

          Reel him back in!

                         SAILOR

                         (TRYING)

          The cable's jammed!

                         PILOT

          If they don't pick him up this time,

          we have to cut him Ioxe!

          The sailor keeps trying to rewind the cable. No go. sweating, he

          wraps gloved fingers around the emergency release on the drum.

          IN THE AIR

          Ryan watches the Dallas' saw rush at him with unbelievable speed, a

          towering black monolith on an ubiquitous canvas of grey.

          ON THE BRIDGE

          Thompson readies the ground, holding one end in the air. A wave

          BLASTS the DALLAS.

          THE GROUNDING CABLE

          rips free of the bridge. Surprised, Thompson goes overboard.

          Caught in his harness, he dangles helplessly above the water.

          Mancuso and Ryan reach for each other as Ryan hurtles at the

          bridge. All hell breaks loose:

          A BOLT OF ELECTRICITY

          arcs between their oohed hands. BLITZED, Mancuso is

          KNOCKED hard to his KNEES.

          IN THE CHOPPER,

          the sailor pulls. the release lever, CUTTING the cable. it SLAMS

          back inside like a two ton rubber band.

          IN THE AIR

          unhooked, Ryan sling-shots fifty yards over the pitching bow of the

          Dalyas, disappearing beneath the ice-cold water.

          UNDER THE. WATER

          Bubbles trailing from his mouth, Ryan struggles to free himself from

          the harness.

          ON THE BRIDGE

          a vision of hell, hair blowing in all diYectlons, Mancuso eyeballs the

          spot where Ryan went down, SCREAMING:

                         MANCUSO

                         (INTO PHONE)

          Man overboard!

          Thompson drags himself back onto the bridge.

          IN THE ESCAPE TRUNK

          Jones hears Mancuso's voice BOOMING over SPEAKERS:

                         MANCUSO (VO)

                         (ON SPEAKERS)

          Man overboard! Twenty yards off

          the starboard bow!

          The COB SLAMS the HATCH, turning the trunk into an iron tomb.

          Jones pulls a mask over his eyes, activates his oxygen and drags

          open the exterior hatch.

          SEA WATER THUNDERS

          in, submerging him in Icy stillness. Securing a line to the

          bulkhead, Jones swims out into the swirling brine.

          IN THE AIR

          the chopper banks hard to the left, climbs Into the mist and starts

          circling the Dams.

          IN THE WATER

          free of the harness, Ryan bobs like a cork in the waves. Fifty

          yards away, the keeness sub p bahes violently.

          A ' DIVER

          surfaces next to Ryan. Removing his mouthpiece, Jones BELLOWS

          over the CRASHING SEA:

                         JONES

          Are. you injured!?

                         JONES

          I'm gonna take you in through an

          escape trunk!

          Jones hooks Ryan to the line. Salt stings Ryan's eyes. His,

          breathing's ragged.

          ON THE DALLAS

          BEDLAM in the CONN. STACCATO orders. Mancuso helps

          Thompson through the hatch. Hell on wheels, Mancuso disappears

          down a passageway.

          IN THE WATER

          Jones and Ryan ride waves by the curved hull. of the ship. Jones

          offers Ryan his mouthpiece.

                         RYAN

          Wait a minute!

                         JONES

          Listen, you son-af-a-bit h. I'm only

          gonna tell you once. Stick this fucking

          thing in your mouth and breathe!

          Ryan takes the mouthpiece, inhaling and exhaling rapidly. The

          helicopter circles above. Jones drags Ryan

          UNDER THE WATER

          into bruised silence. Pulling themselves downward along the Dalla

          rolling hull, Ryan and Jones share oxygen.

          IN THE ESCAPE TRUNK

          Ryan and Jones pull themselves inside. Blazing light ignites a fire

          storm of one-caned organisms. Eyes wide, Ryan watches Jones c3 se

          the hatch.

          Jones starts draining the trunk. Everything slows down. Echoes

          REVERBERATE. The water level in the trunk drops and the

          SHRIEK OF PRESSURIZED AIR

          ASSAULTS Ryan's EARDRUMS. Hurling the mouthpiece. away, he

          gulps air in the rapidly draining trunk like a banked trout.

          IN THE HALLWAY

          outside the trunk, Mancuso and crew open the hatch. Tumbling

          out, Ryan stands; on shaky legs, excited, babbling:

                         RYAN

          Jesus Christ! I cant believe it!

          Jesus Christ --A

          When I hit the water, it was like Ice.

          I thought I was going to freeze --

                         MANCUSO

          Slow down. You're hypervent it sting.

                         (RYAN BLINKS)

          Now, who are you?

                         RYAN

                         (DISORIENTED)

          Sorry. I'm Jack Ryan. Are you

          Captain Mancuso?

          Mancuso nods. The radioman appears with another message.

          Mancuso rips it open and starts reading it. Ryan rockets into

                         PRESENT TIME:

                         RYAN (CONT'D)

          I'Il be in the Conn.

          JUMP CUT TO:

          at the entrance of the sonar shack, fifteen minutes later. Behind

          him, in the Conn, the crew is preparing to man battle stations.

          Jones has returned to sonar.

                         MANCUSO

                         (TO JONES)

          Any sign that he's alerted to our

          presence?

                         JONES

          No, sir, captain. operating as before.

          Ryan appears in dry clothes. Mancuso ignores him. The of5cer of

          the deck turns to Mancuso:

                         OOD

          Captain. Battle stations are manned.

                         MANCUSO

          Very well.

                         RYAN

          What do you mean battle stations?

                         (URGENTLY)

          Look, I've been authorized by the

          President of the United States to

          talk to the Captain of Red October.

          Mancuso takes the last message from his pocket:

                         MANCUSO

          And I have been ordered to blow him

          out of the water if he stays on a

          course to the United States or

          demonstrates any hostile intentions.

                         RYAN

                         (STUNNED)

          I don't understand.

                         MANCUSO

                         (RE: MESSAGE)

          According to this he's gone bughouse

          and intends to fire his missiles. So

          much f= your defection theory.

          Mancuso hands Ryan the message.. Ryan stares at. it. Mancuso

          turns back to the officer of the deck:

                         MANCUSO (CONT'D)

          Officer of the deck. Make,

                         RYAN

                         (RE: MESSAGE)

          Think about this a second. Naturally

          the Soviets would tall us he is insane.

          They want us to sink him before he has

          an opportunity to defect.

                         JONES

                         (TO MANCUSO)

          Captain, crazy Ivan.

          All. stop i Come left and stay in his

          baffles. Rig for quiet running.

          The officer of the deck repeats Mancuso's orders. Mancuso and

          Ryan are eyeball-etc-eyeball.. Ryan whispers:

                         RYAN

          Listen to me, Captain. There must

          be some way you can establish contact

          without violating your orders. I'm

          telling you, he wants to defect.

                         (MANCUSO FROWNS)

          If there's ever going to be peace in

          the world somebody has to take a risk.

          Give the man a chance. He's defecting.

          I know it.

                         (MANCUSO HESITATES)

          AIL back two-thirds.

          Nobody moves. Jones glances at Mancuso. Mancuso stares at Ryan

          do you want to say?

          Ryan chooses his words carefully. As he does, Mancuso hits a

          periscope light in morse:

                         RYAN

          American government told you intend

          to launch mis. lc s. Do not approach

          U.S. coast, or you .w>7 . be attacked.

          If you understand, ping once.

                         (TO MANCUSO)

          He can do that, can't he?

                         MANCUSO

          He can do that. But is he gonna do

          that?

          ON RED OCTOBER

          in the Conn, Ramius is still at. the scope, watching the light in the

          Dalla' periscope. After a moment, he, glances at Borodin:

                         RAM=S

          Verify the range again.

                         (BEAT)

          Ping one time only.

          ON THE DALLAS

          in the Conn, Mancuso's at the scope. Ryan is scribbling something

          on a pad. Sailors hear a PING. Thompson grins.

                         MANCUSO

          I'D. be dammed.

                         (TO RYAN)

          Now what?

                         (RE: PAD)

          Send him this.

          Are you out of your mind?

                         RYAN

          Just send it.

                         (THINKING)

          And ten him to ping again if he agrees.

          ON RED OCTOBER

          in the Conn, Ramius is at the scope, watching the flashing light.

          After a second, he steps back, face white. Finally, he turns to

                         BORODIN:

                         RAMIUS

          Verify the range one more time.

                         RAMIUS

          Give me a sounding, ' Vasily! Ping

          once only.

          Borodin goes to work. Ramius stares at Melekhin. Melekhin frowns.

          What the hell is happening?

          ON THE DALLAS

          in the Conn, Mancuso, Ryan and the crew hear another PING.

          Ryan's ecstatic. Mancuso Isn't.

                         MANCUSO

          Ryan, what's going on?

                         (9 G)

          If the Soviets want us to sink Red

          October. We just might have to oblige.

                         CUT TO:

                         THE DEEP

          black as night, reverberating with eerie nightmares. From the

          cloying dark, Red October rises, a shimmering phosphorescent giant.

          THE REYKJANES RIDGE

          Off the coast of Iceland

          Morning of the fourth day

          in engineering, Petrov and Melekhin stand at a sink on the reactor

          bulkhead. Valves and tubing hang over the sink. Technicians in

          the background.

          Melekhin's in rubber apron, gloves and plastic face shield. Dressed

          identicaMy, Petrov halls a book. Signs on the wall indicate

          radiation danger.

                         MELEKHIN

          Valve three shut.

          He shuts a valve with a large wrench. Turning a page, Petrov

                         READS:

                         PETROV

          Placing flask under valve four. Drawing

          sample.

          A tiny stream of fluid fa]ls into the flask. Unexpectedly, an ALARM

          GOES OFF. Technicians freeze.

                         PETROV

          Shut the valve and secure the sink!

          Melekhin shuts the, valve. Petrov stares at the alarm. Below it, a

          meter is flashing red:

                         PETROV (CONT'D)

          Seal that sample in a plastic bag and

          take it to the lab. I'I1 get the Captain!

                         CUT TO:

          RAMIUS AND BORODIN

          drinking tea and munching black bread in Red October's wardroom.

          Nobody else around. Borodin smiles at Ramius fondly:

                         BORODIN

          Do you think they will let me live in

          Montana?

                         RAMIUS

          I think they w91 let you live wherever

          you want, my find.

                         BORODIN

          Good. Then I will raise rabbits in

          Montana and marry a round American

                         I

          woman who will cook them for me.

                         (SMILING)

          And she will have friends who are

          Indians and we wiin ride horses on

          Sunday.

          Ramius laughs. Petrov barges in, talking as he enters:

          PET RO V

          Captain, there are high Esaosion product

          levels in the primary coolant!

                         (BABBLING)

          I knew we should have checked the

          reactor before we started it. When

          the caterpillar broke down the vare

          must have been damaged!

                         RANIUS

          Keep your vcadoe down, Doctor. There

          are several explanations -

                         PETROV

          Listen to me. Radioactive fuel is in

          the water. If it gets into our air,

          it could ' loll us all!

                         RAMIUS

          I said, keep your voice down. The

                         CREW -

                         PETROV

                         (SHRILL)

          I will not! We have a level four

          radiation leak. And if something

          isn't done, we're all going to die! -

          Ramius stands. Suddenly, Petrov remembers where he is. Ramius'

          eyes are bullet holes. Wilting,, Petrov stammers:

                         PETROV (CONT'D)

          Forgive me, Captain. But -

                         RAMIUS

          it's probably a piece of corrosion in

          the pipes. That happens. Now let's

          take' another sample. But quietly.

          We don't want to panic the crew.

          JUMP CUT TO:

                         ENGINEERING

          minutes later. Melekhin and Petrov prepare to draw another sample

          at the sink. Ramius stands behind them. Technicians to the rear.

          Melekhin struggles with the valve:

                         MELEKHIN

          I may have shut it too hard.

          Grabbing the wrench, Ramius leans his weight on it. Suddenly, the

                         -87-

          valve CRACKS. HOT water SPRAYS Ramius in the FACE. Melekhin

                         FREAKS:

                         MELEKHIN (CONT'D)

          Secure the valve before the water

          turns to steam !

          Desperately, Ramius tries to plug the hole. The VALVE BREAKS.

          BOILING WATER pours out, turning to STEAM, SPLATTERING

          Melekhin. ALARMS GO OFF. Ramius BELLOWS:

                         RAMIUS

          Evacuate the compartment-'

          Technicians scramble for the door. Searing hot steam chokes the

          compartment. Melekhin SCREAMS:

                         MELEKHIN

          in try and stop the leak. Everybody

          get the hen out of here!

          IN THE CONN

          Crew members are panicking. ALARMS are GOING OFF. Dripping

          water, Ramius charges in. On the deck, Borodin SHOUTS:

                         (ON HEADSET)

          Captain, radiation alarms are activating

          in all compartments. Engineering is

          heavily contaminated. Radiation is

          Sailors in the Conn stare at the Captain. Ramins BELLOWS:

                         RAMIUS

                         (TO BORODIN)

          Alright. Pass word to abandon ship.

          ON THE SURFACE

          Red October rises in angry sea. An emergency door on the sail

          opens. Seconds later, a hatch on the missile deck opens also. The

          sea RAGES.

          Climbing out on the deck, Tblllsi and a half a dozen sailors try to

          inflate rafts. Red October PITCHES and ROLLS. Wind HOWLS.

          Frurated, Tbilisi SCREAMS into a headset.

          IN THE CONN

          through the open emergency door, the sea CRASHES. Frightened to

          death, shivering sailors in life preservers line up to leave. Petrov

          counts them. Ramius stands by Sorodin.

                         BORODIN

          Captain. L,ieubenant Tbi3JsJ reports the

                         RAMIUS

          All right. Instruct the crew to secure

          the rafts to the deck. When all. personnel

          are aboard the rafts, we will scuttle

          the ship out from under us!

          ON THE DECK.

          Ocean, ROARS. Fighting gale farce WINDS, sailors Me out of the

          hatch and tie down the rafts. Around them, the hounds of hell are

          loose on the face of the deep.

          IN THE CONN

          the last of the crew leaves. Borodin is at the periscope, Kamarov

          stands by Ramius. Only offfcers are left.

                         KAMAROV

          Captain, Major Tbilisi reports the crew

          are secured in rafts and rafts are tied

                         (TO PETROV)

          There's only one thing we can do. Go

          topside and take care of the crew. I

          and my officers wall submerge the ship

          and take her elsewhere to scuttle. The

          Americans must never have this boat!

          All Petrov wants do to is get his ass off the boat. At the door,

          Ramius stops him:

                         RAMIUS (CONT'D)

          Petrov splits. Borodin slams the hatch behind him and seals it.

                         RAMIUS (CONT'D)

                         (TO BORODIN)

          Submerge the ship.

          ON THE DECK

          the ocean RAGES. Red October sets to submerge. GEYSERS of

          WATER and air EXPLODE hundreds of feet in the sky as she dives.

          The BLOWBACK is STAGGERING.

          Wild-eyed sailors in rubber rafts hang on for their lives. On the

          horizon, Petrov spots the American frigate hurtling forward, light

          flashing.

          A puff of smoke appears, fbnowed by a muted EXPLOSION. The

          frigate's FIRING. As the round comes in, there is an

          EARSPLITTING SHRIEK.

          A hundred yards beyond Red October's bow, the SEA EXPLODES.

          The CONCUSSION and the STORM are mind-bending. Petrov thinks

          the world's coming to an end.

          In the rafts, men slash at ropes binding them to the deck. One by

          one, they drift free of the submerging ship into foaming sea. One

          sailor can't cut his rope. His raft's dragged under.

          Wind HOWLS. The frigate FIRES AGAIN. Another EARSPLITTING

          SHRIEK. Another EXPLOSION. Tons of icy saltwater cascade over

          Petxov's head. -

          Gulping air, Petrov spots the raft and sail r pop back to the

          surface. Red October's sail disappears. Sailors haul freezing men

          from raging water. Hell on earth.

                         CUT TO:

                         THE FRIGATE

          IN THE COMBAT INFORMATION CENTER

          aboard the frigate, thirty sailors work various consoles replete with

          IN THE HELICOPTER

          on the fwltml of the frigate, PILOT and copilot are strapped into the

          Copy that. We're on our way.

          IN. THE AIR

          the helicopter rises from the fantail of the frigate. In seconds, it

          passes over Petrov and his companions floating in rubber rafts in

          choppy sea.

          IN ATHE HELICOPTER

          the pilot glances over his shoulder at a SENSOR OPERATOR working

          a computer behind the copilot:

          IN THE WATER

          the life rafts converge on the frigate like insects hovering round an

          oversized queen. In one of the rafts, Petrov watches as a net is

          thrown down at him.

          IN THE HELICOPTER

          aboard the fcigate, Curry turns to one of the shadows:

                         CURRY

          Seahawk One reports torpedo armed

          and ready to fire. Requests final

          authorization to drop.

          IN THE RAFTS

          Petrov and the others climb the nets. Halfway up, the doctor stares

          back at the helicopter hovering in the distance.

          IN THE AIR

          thirty feet above the water, the helicopter releases a torpedo in the

          area where Red October went down.

          ON THE FRIGATE

          Petrov climbs onto the fantail. U.S. sailors are waiting with coffee

          and blankets. Fuming, Petrov confronts an officer:

                         PETROV

          I protest! What authority do you

          have to fire? I protest!

          IN THE CIC

          Curry coordinates information. AIL around him, men work intensely.

          Curry turns to one of the shadows:

                         CURRY

          Seahawk One reports torpedo is launched

          and running normally at forty knots.

          I have it on sonar.

                         (TURNING)

          Four hundred yards from drop paint.

          Eight hundred yards. Twelve hundred

          yards.

          One of the shadows leans forward and presses a button on Curry's

          console. The button is marked Command Control Detonate. The

                         SHADOW IS

                         ADMIRAL GREER

          in a white uniform and cap. Beside him, Skip Tyler, leans on his

          cane, concentrating on Curry's display.

          IN THE HELICOPTER

          Pilot studies the sea. Suddenly, it BULGES. Loud CONCUSSION.

          Shock WAVE. A giant mushroom cap rises from the depths as gas

          bubbles vent.

          ON THE FANTAIL

          Petrov watches in horror as a huge concave impression vents below

          the helicopter. A huge plume of gas and water erupts skyward.

          IN THE CIC

          aboard the frigate, Curry turns to Greer:

                         CURRY

          Torpedo has detonated.

                         GREER

          And you understand, Lieutenant. I

          was never here. That torpedo did not

          self-destruct. It hit the target. Right?

                         (CURRY NODS)

          Now, Contact the Dallas and tell them

          to proceed.

          Curry nods.

                         CUT TO:

                         MANCUSO

          in the Conn aboard the Dallas with Thompson. Mancuso has a .45 in

          a holster on his belt. Thompson reads a message:

                         THOMPSON

          Frigate reports phase one completed,

          Captain. We are ordered to proceed.

                         MANCUSO

          OK. Now comes the weird part.

          Thompson fo lows Mancuso out of the Conn into

                         A PASSAGEWAY

          running aft. Mancuso and Thompson move at speed. Mancuso is far

                         FROM HAPPY:

                         MANCUSO

          I don't like leaving the boat, Phil.

          But the orders are specific.

                         THOMPSON

          We're gonna be f ne.

          Rounding a corner, they start

          DOWN A LADDER

          Thompson will never get over how fast Mancuso can move. Aren't

          guys that big supposed to be slow?

                         MANCUSO

          This has got to be the craziest stunt

          I've ever heard of. There's only about

          two ml]]k n things that can st]l. go wrong.

          At the bottom of the ladder, they enter

                         A PASSAGEWAY

          Ahead of them Jones and Ryan wait by a ladder beneath an open

          hatch. Like Mancuso, Jones is armed. Jones starts up the ladder.

          Ryan follows. Mancuso turns to Thompson:

                         MANCUSO

          Listen. If anything --

                         THOMPSON

          Captain. We'll be all right.

          Mancuso climbs up the ladder, disappearing through the hatch.

          Thompson closes it.

                         CUT TO:

          WARRANT OFFICER STEINER

          sitting before a wheel at a brightly lit panel, just as cocky as when

          we last saw him in the mini sub at Tyler's lab. Next to him, a

          COPILOT checks a clipboard.

          Behind them, Jones, Ryan and Mancuso climb up through a hatch.

          Jones shuts it. Steiner speaks into a headset::

                         STEINER

          OX. Passengers are aboard. Check-off

          complete. Request clearance to lift-off.

                         (TURNING)

          Gentlemen, we have clearance. Fasten

          your belts and grab your nuts. We're

          taking a ride.

          Ryan sits opposite Mancuso. Jones is to Mancuso's right. The

          bulkhead rocks slightly. Steiner turns a yoke.

                         STEINER (CONT'D)

          Battery sperm?

                         -95-

          Roger. Coming right to course zero-seven-

          ive. Make initial preparations to land.

          The copilot starts toggling switches. Behind him, Mancuso checks

          the .45 in his holster. Ryan watches.

                         COPILOT

          Contact is two hundred yards below.

          One hundred yards ahead.

          Roger.

                         (BEAT)

          Hit the running lights.

          IN THE WATER

          -black on black. Then, in a single blinding flash of light

          THE RED OCTOBER

          is revealed. Hovering above it, floodlights blazing, the DSRV.

          Descending, it locks onto a hatch by the sail.

          IN THE DSRV

          Copilot turns to Steiner:

                         COPILOT

          We have a seal. Skirt is dry.

                         STEINER

          Roger. Open the hatch.

          Getting up, the copilot heads for the hatch.

                         MANCUSO

          Wait.

          Copilot stops. Reaching into his jacket, Mancuso offers Ryan a .45.

                         RYAN

                         (EYEING PI- )

          He's defecting.

                         MANCUSO

          And he can't change his mind?

                         RYAN

          He's not going to change his mind.

                         MANCUSO

          Willing to bet your life on that.'

          Ryan stares at the pistol. Sighing, he puts it in his jacket.

          Copilot opens the hatch. In the gloom below, another hatch.

          Copilot raps on it. Somebody opens the lower hatch. Mancuso,

          Jones and Ryan climb down into

          THE RED OCTOBER

          on a ladder at the forward end of the Conn. Waiting for them,

          Ramins, Borodin and all the other of Awkward silence.

          Nervous, Borodin drags out a cigarette and lights it. Unexpectedly,

                         RYAN- SMI1 :

                         RYAN

          Russian Cigarette?

                         (BORODIN NODS)

          Could I try one?

          Mancuso frowns. Borodin offers Ryan a cigarette. Kamarov has a

          light. Ryan inhales and COUGHS:

                         RYAN (CONT'D)

                         (GAGGING)

          Jesus...

          Poking fun, Ryan rolls his eyes. Borodin grins. Ramius

          The ice is broken. Men shake hands.

                         RAMIUS

          Gentlemen, I am Marko Ramius. I and

          my offers request political asylum in

          the United States.

                         (BEAT)

          Before I go any further, I want to know

          whose idea is this impos.ih18 plan?

                         MANCUSO

                         (RE: RYAN)

          His.

                         RAMIUS

                         (TO RYAN)

          Amazing. our intention was to publicly

          surrender this boat and request asylum.

          it never occurred to us there would be

          a way you could keep it. The idea to

          stage a radiation leak was inspired --

                         (FROWNING)

          You look familiar. Do I know you,

          Commander?

                         RYAN

          You have a good memory, Captain. We

          meet briefly years ago. But I'm not

          a naval commander. I work for the CIA.

                         RAMIUS

          CIA?

                         RYAN

          Easy, Captain. I'm not an agent. I'm

          just an analyst.

                         (SMRNNG)

          I write books.

          Suddenly, HIGH SPEED SCREWS passing over the HULL:

                         KAMAROV

          Torpedo! Americans are shooting at us.

                         JONES

          Wrong. Ours growl. Yours whine. It's

          Russian!

                         CUT TO:

                         GREER

          leaning over Curry's console in the CIC aboard the frigate.

          Agitated, Curry works his computer.

                         GREER

          What do you mean there's another torpedo?

          Where in hell did it come from?

                         CUT TO:

                         TUPOLEV

          in the Conn aboard the Konovalov. His crew's at battle stations.

          Bonavia mans fire cost 'aL opening a mike, Tupolev SHOUTS:

                         (ON SPEAKERS)

          The weapon enabled on the other side

          before it armed.

                         TUPOLEV

                         (TO BONAVIA)

          You had the wrong range, idiot! Fire

          again with the right settings. And

          reload both tubes.

          ON THE DALLAS

          Thompson stands outside the sonar shack. To his left, the COB is

          behind fire control. Beaumont has taken Jones' position.

          What's the status of Red October?

                         BEAUMONT

          Dead in the water.

                         THOMPSON

          They can't maneuver with the goddam

          DSRV stuck to them.

                         (WHISPERING)

          Come on, Mancuso, move it. Get the

          hell out of there.

          ON RED OCTOBER

          BEDLAM in the Conn. Tba'lisi and Jones are on their way to sonar.

          Ramius SHOUTS at Melekhin:

                         RAMIUS

          Get back to engineering and give me

          some power!

                         (TO MANCUSO

                         RE: DSRV)

          Get that damn thing off my boat.

          Mancuso's halfway up the ladder. He spots Steiner peeking down at

                         HIM:

                         STEINER

          I think somebody just shot a torpedo

          at us!

                         MANCUSO

          No shit, buckwheat. Get the hell. out

                         (STUNNED)

          Where am I supposed --

          Mancuso SLAMS the HATCH. Scrambling down the ladder, Mancuso

          hears Ramius bel]Dwing at Borodin who is manning the helm:

                         -99-

                         RAMIUS

          No, Vasily. I need you in fire control.

          We must track whoever's out there.

          Borodin heads for fre control. Ramius tosses Ryan into the chair

          behind the helm :

                         RAMIUS (CONT'D)

          You sit here!

                         RAMIUS

          Do exactly as I tell you!

          Stunned, Ryan grabs the helm. Jones and Tbilisi, must have made it

          to sonar. Speakers CRACKLE:

                         (ON SPEAKERS)

          Torpedo in the water. High speed screws.

                         RAMIUS

                         (TO RYAN)

          Turn the helm to the heft. Steer course

          zero-two-zero.

                         MANCUSO

                         (TO RAMIUS)

          Wait a minute! That's heading into the

                         JONES (VO)

                         (ON SPEAKERS)

          Steady bearing to the weapon. Still

                         (TO RYAN)

          Turn that helm to the left until the

          dial says course zero-two-zero.

                         MANCUSO

          No! That's wrong. Ryan, don't turn

          that goddam wheel!

          Ryan stares at Mancuso then at Ramius. Deciding, he turns the

          helm left, coming to course zero-two-zero.

                         RYAN

                         (TOO MANCUSO)

          You're heading straight into that torpedo.

                         RAMIUS

          I know.

          IN THE CIC

          aboard the frigate. Helms, Greer and Tyler lean over the

          Your conclusions were wrong, Ryan.

          Halsey acted stupidly.

          CRASH. The Conn ROCKS. Sound of TORPEDO BREAKING UP.

          Metal SCRAPES along the SHIP. Realizing what's going on:

                         - MANCUSO

          I'll be dammed.

                         RYAN

          What happened?

                         MANCUSO

          Combat tack, Mr. Ryan. By turning

          into the torpedo,, Ramius closed the

          distance before it could arm itself.

          I never would have thought of it.

                         RYAN

          So we're safe?

                         RAMIUS

          Not yet. Right now, the Soviet Captain,

          a man named Tupolev is removing the

          safety features on all his weapons.

          He won't make the same mistake twice.

          Behind Ramius, Ryan spots a SHADOW at the rear of the Conn. He

          can't believe his eyes. The goddam shadow has a pistol in hand.

                         SUDDENLY:

          A FIRE STORM

          of GUNFIRE sprays the CONN. Everybody scatters. Borodin is

          HIT. SLAMMING into the bulkhead, he falls in a seated position,

          eyes wide.

          Fire control panel EXPLODES. Behind a console, Mancuso drags out

          his .45 and RETURNS FIRE. The shadow disappears.

          ON THE DALLAS

          Beaumont rips off his headgear, turning to Thompson in the sonar

          shack's door, breathing hard:

                         BEAUMONT

          Gunfire?

          ON THE KONOVALOV

          in the Conn, Tupa]av is furious. He YELLS at Bonavia:

                         TUPOLEV

          Hurry up goddammit! I want all the

          enabling devices disconnected!

                         BONAVIA

          Captain, I cannot go any faster.

          ON RED OCTOBER

          in the Conn, cars crawl from hiding. Sparks ERUPT from

          WIRES. Fire contra is history. Ramius leans over Borodin:

                         BORODIN

          I would have like to have seen Montana.

          And the Indians.

          He dies. RAGING, Ramius POUNDS the BULKHEAD. Kamarov

          notices a light on a panel:

                         KAMAROV

          He's in the missile compartment!

                         RAMIUS

          The ship is yours.

                         MANCUSO

          But the control is blasted to hell.

          I can't shoot.

                         RAMIUS

          Then get behind him and stay there.

          Don't let him put you in his sights

          or we're all dead.

          Mancuso tosses Ramius his .45. Catching it, Ramius splits. Ryan

          follows.

                         CUT TO:

                         TUPOLEV

          a caged tiger in the Conn on the Konovalov. Bonavia turns, looking

          back at him :

          Left full rudder. T11 shake him loose.

          ON RED OCTOBER

          in a passageway outside a door to the missile compartment, Ramius

          and Ryan hug the bulkhead:

                         RAMIUS

          He'll break into a panel and short

          -circuit the wiring on a missile. We'll

          be blown to pieces.

          Taking a deep breath, Ryan follows Ramiais into the

                         MISSILE COMPARTMENT

          coming face-too-face with a BARRAGE of GUNFIRE. Ramius is HIT.

          Ryan drags him into a space behind an electrical panel. Mercifully,

          the shooting STOPS.

          Ryan checks Ramius. His shoulder's a mess. Mind riling, Ryan

          studies his surroundings. He's never felt so alone.

          The compartment is vast, dominated by twenty tussle tubes six feet

          in diameter. Overhead, a catwalk. At the aft end, somebody's

          working with a wrench.

                         RAMIUS

          We must stop him before he gets into

          a panel..

          Ryan stares at Ramius. Ramiii isn't gonna stop anybody.

          Resigned, Ryan finds the .45 Mancuso gave him in his pocket,

                         MUMBLING:

                         RYAN

          Next time memos. Only memos.

                         RAMIUS

          Be careful what you shoot at in here,

          Ryan. The compartment is very sensitive.

          In a daze, Ryan starts walking aft, still MUMBLING:

                         RYAN

          Be careful what you shoot at, Ryan.

          Very sensitive.. .in here...

          Sensitive stuff...in here ...I have

          to... be careful... of course.

          The ship turns. Wall becomes cuing. Grabbing the catwalk, Ryan

          hangs at a ninety degree angle. GUNFIRE. Bullets RIP into the

          BULKHEAD inches from his HEAD:

          the DAIlas heads for the surface. Counter-measures head for the

          ON THE SURFACE

          The Da11a ERUPTS from the WATER at THIRTY DEGREES, her

          bottom exposed well aft of the sail. A broaching behemoth, she

          ON THE FRIGATE

          neither Soviet nor American sailors on the fantail can believe their

          insane?.

          ON RED OCTOBER

          in the missile compartment, blood pounding, Ryan leans flat against

          a missile tube. On the other side of the tube, METAL fans on

          CONCRETE.

          Rounding the tube, Ryan holds the .45 at arm's length. Kneeling

          before him, directly in front of an open panel on the missale bay is a

          Sovvet sail or with crazy eyes:

                         IT'S LOGINOV

          the cook's assistant who witnessed the Putin key exchange. He's

          got a hot wire in each hand. Time stands sthl. Ryan stares at

          Loginov. Loginov stares back.

          There's something in the Loginov's eyes, an uncompromising,

          irrational vi lainy that asks no forgiveness. For a moment, Ryan's

          paralyzed, a rabbit before a cobra.

          Deliberately, Loginov begins to move his hands together, bringing

          the wires closer. Ryan tri es to speak. He can't. Loginov's grin

          cracks wide like a rotten egg.

                         RYAN FIRES

          Flame LEAPS from the BARREL of the .45. The pistol KICKS like a

                         RYAN

                         (NODDING)

          Wreckage.

                         CUT TO:

                         PELT

          in his office seated across from Lysenko:

                         PELT

          With the depth of the water and the

          wreckage scattered over such a wide

          area, it we]. be a long time before

          anything is recovered. Your people

          are already interviewing the crew and

          making arrangements for their r turn.

          (Lysenko nods,

                         SOBERLY)

          This has been a terrible tragedy, Mr.

          Ambassador. I can only stress that if

          you'd come to us earlier, it might have

          been avcdded.

                         LYSENKO

          I appreciate your candor in the matter.

                         PELT

                         (SMOOTHLY)

          And I yours, Andrei..

                         LYSENKO

                         (PROBING)

          Perhaps in the future, the technology

          will be available for a more thorough

          I n vestigation of the wreckage...

                         PELT

                         (STEADY)

          Perhaps.

          A long beat as the two men stare at each other. Lysenko finally

          breaks it off:

                         LYSENKO

          There is another matter... One I am

          reluctant to -

                         PELT

          No. Please go ahead.

                         LYSENKO

          One of our submarines, an Akula, was

          last reported in the Reykjanes Ridge.

          We have not heard from her for sometime.

          Pelt stares at him blankly, time hangs suspended. Finally, Peat

          reaches far the bridge of his now as if to stave of a ]dtler

                         HEADACHE:

                         PELT

          You've lost another submarine?

                         (BEAT)

          Andre...

          Lysenko sits, hat in hand. Finally, he averts his gaze.

          JUMP CUT TO:

                         A DRIVER

          standing beside a limousine outside the Executive Office Building.

          Fuming, Lysenko approaches. The driver smiles. Not a good idea.

                         LYSENKO SNARL:

                         LYSENKO

          Shut up! Don't speak to me Boris. Don't

          ever speak to me unless I speak to you

          first. And wipe that smile off your face!

          Lysenko pBe into the limo, slamming the door as hard as he can.

          Locked inside, he starts shouting and hitting things.

                         CUT TO:

                         BRIGHT MOONLIGHT

          on the tree studded bank of a large coastal river. A gentle breeze

          touches the trees and punctuates the silence. Crickets and frogs

          sing on the shore:

          SUPER: ORICOKE RIVER

                         PAMLICO SOUND

                         NORTH CAROLINA

          THE RED OCTOBER

          glides quietly up the river's surface. Ramius and Ryan stand on

          the sail. Behind them, two junior officers, one American and one

          Russian, Conn the ship:

                         RYAN

          We're two hundred miles from the nearest

          naval base.

                         RAMIUS

          Interesting notion, hiding a submarine

          in a river.

                         (EYEING SHORE)

          How do you know this place?

                         RYAN

          I grew up not far from here.

                         (PAINTING)

          My grandfather taught me to f5sh right

          over there on that rock.

          Ramius spots a large rock on the shore. So warm and inviting, this

          land, when compared to the bitter cold coast he ]eft a ]ifetl,me ago.

          Ram hl studies Ryan in the stillness:

                         RAMIUS

          There is one question you have not

          asked me.

                         RYAN

          Why?

                         (RAMIUS NODS)

          I assumed you would speak when you were

          ready.

                         RAMIUS

          We. are standing on part of the reason.

          I've spent my life preparing to fight a

          war I hoped would never happen. This

          ship was not built to fight such a war.

          it was built to start one.

                         (BEAT)

          And there were personal reasons.

                         RYAN

          Your wife?

                         RAMIUS

                         (NODDING)

          it started there, perhaps.

          Ramius glances at the rock. Beside it, a muskrat drops quietly into

          the water.

                         RAMIUS (CONT'D)

          Or perhaps it was something that started

          long ago...

                         RYAN

          Fishing?

                         RAMTUS

          Fishing.

          Taking a deep breath, Ramius studies the surrounding hills. Lights

          from farms twinkle in the night air.

                         RAMIUS (CONT'D)

          "The sea will, grant each man new

          hope, as sleep doth dream of home."

          (on Ryan's look)

          Christopher Columbus.

          Ryan smilm.

                         RYAN

                         (QU`EDY)

          Welcome to the new world, sir.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

                         A STEWARDESS

          walking down the aisle of an airplane, checking passengers.

          Stopping near the front of the cabin, she glances down at

                         RYAN

          sound asleep in his seat, empty tea cup on a tray beside him. A

          blanket hangs on one log. In the seat next to him

          A TEDDY BEAR

          smi> out at passing clouds. The bear's got a red ribbon round his

          neck-and a seat belt fastened over his bulging tummy.

          Covering Ryan with the blanket, the stewardess leaves. Tea cup

          RATTLES. Ryan doesn't even twitch. Turbulence is a thing of the

          past.

                         FADE OUT

                         THE END
