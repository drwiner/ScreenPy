       MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD

                        Written by

                 John Collee & Peter Weir

   1. THE OCEAN - DUSK

   From blackness, a pattern slowly emerges - shimmering,

   abstract lines form into waves cresting above steep-sided

   valleys of water.

   Finally the picture settles into a high, wide shot of the

   ocean and an adjacent coastline.

   In a corner of the screen, the last rays of sunlight touch a

   small, dark shape causing it to glow in the gathering

   darkness: A three-masted sailing vessel.

   2. THE SHIP - DUSK

   [   ] She passes close enough to touch: hawsers as thick as a

   man's trunk, massive black-painted timbers, muzzles of her

   great guns projecting from every gun-port.

   As the ship glides past and away from us, her name is

   visible, picked out in dull gold on the transom - Surprise.

   3. ANOTHER ANGLE - DUSK

   The ship in silhouette - RUN CAPTION:

           HMS Surprise

           Armament: 28 guns Crew: 197 souls.

           Location: Coast of Brazil, November 1806

           Mission: Intercept and destroy French

           Privateer, Acheron

   5.   THE GREAT CABIN - DUSK

   CAPTAIN JACK AUBREY, with his back to us, bends over the

   table, studying charts.

   His servant, KILLICK, a pig-tailed, ear-ringed man of

   indeterminate age, refills the glass at his elbow.

   JACK drinks. The glass catches the setting sun as it drops

   below the great casement windows.

   KILLICK lights a lamp, places it next to his captain and

   retires.

                    JACK

          (Absently) Thankee Killick

   4. THE CHARTS:

   a beautifully drawn chart of the South American coastline.

   Jack's hands place a second chart on top of the first,

   bringing the north-east coast of Brazil into view. Then

   another, each one enlarging the view of the preceding one.

   On the final chart we can read navigational symbols and

   detailed information in fine copperplate script:

          6 fa. Shoals suddenly to half fa. Rocks

          (exact position unknown). Hidden reef.

   6. BELOW DECKS - NIGHT

   Another lamp illuminates 1st lieutenant TOM PULLINGS, his

   pleasant open face marred by a diagonal sabre scar running

   from brow to chin.

   He is making a final tour of inspection before lights out.

7. THE DOCTOR'S CABIN - NIGHT

Dr STEPHEN MATURIN, a keen naturalist, sits at his desk

surrounded by specimen jars, books and scientific

instruments.

[   ]

TOM PULLINGS glances in as he moves past the cabin door, but

the doctor, placing weights on some finely-balanced

structure, is too engrossed to notice him.

8. MIDSHIPMAN'S BERTH - NIGHT

In the quarters for the 'young gentlemen', boys trained from

an early age to become officers, four lads play at marbles.

PETER CALAMY (16) and LORD BLAKENEY (13) are arguing about

whether a marble was inside outside the circle as their berth

mates BOYLE (15) and WILLIAMSON (14) wait for the game to

resume.

                    BLAKENEY

          In

                      CALAMY

          Out.

                    BLAKENEY

          In. It was here. The line is in.

                    CALAMY

          It was there. It was out. Out

                    BLAKENEY

          In. Tell him Boyle. It was in I say.

The lamp moves on, illuminating a fifth midshipman, much

older than the rest. This is HOLLOM, aged 24. He's a

sensitive-looking fellow, idly strumming a guitar, glancing

up briefly as TOM PULLINGS passes.

9. GUN-DECK - NIGHT

By the galley stove at the forward end of the gun-deck a few

of the foremast hands enjoy a last smoke and a mug of grog.

Faster Doudle passes his mug to Higgins who guzzles it down

greedily

One man, BECKETT, sits shirtless while another, AWKWARD

DAVIES, brow furrowed with concentration, tattoos the first

link of what will be a great chain round BECKETT's waist.

JOE PLAICE, at 45 one of the oldest men on board, stops in

the middle of a story as PULLINGS passes, everyone knuckling

their foreheads in deference to the officer.

10.    BETWEEN TWO GUNS - NIGHT

Boys no more than eight or nine years old play a game of

'jacks' with some sheep bones. ADDISON, RYE and SWIFT are the

powder-monkeys who ferry powder from the hold to the guns

during action.

11.    BERTH DECK - NIGHT

A hundred hammocks swing like strange pods, close packed

under the immense beams. Most of the occupants are already

asleep: here an arm, there a lolling head

                    HOLLAR

          Lights out!

On the bosun's command, the last of the off-duty men climb

into their hammocks.

The last lights are extinguished. Only PULLINGS' lamp

remains, moving up the ladder to...

12.   WEATHER DECK - NIGHT

The uppermost or weather deck consists of two parallel

gangways linking the forecastle (forward) to the quarterdeck

(aft).

The lead is dropped from the bows. As PULLINGS walks aft to

the quarterdeck as each man lets go his coils of the deep sea

line.

                     CREWMEN

           Watch there! Watch

Somewhere a bell sounds and the silent figures of the watch

call from their stations.

                     WATCH CAPTAINS

           - Lifebuoy all's well!

           - Starboard gangway all's well!

           - Starboard bow all's well!

Over this, the splash of the lead and the repeated cry of

"Watch there! Watch!"

13.     QUARTERDECK - NIGHT

Pullings has joined the officer of the watch, 2nd Lieutenant

MOWETT, a short tubular man in his early 20s.

JACK climbs up a ladder and we see him properly for the first

time: a heavy-set man in his thirties, thick blonde hair

clubbed at the back

At the binnacle, by the ship's great wheel. The helmsman,

BONDEN - a London cockney with a boxer's face - gives JACK

their current course.

JACK nods, then moves to the gunwale with PULLINGS. Jack

sniffs the air and speaks in a low voice.

                     JACK

           How I do hate a lee shore

                     PULLINGS

           You think we'll have long to wait?

                    JACK

              (shrugs)

          Intelligence reports had her leaving

          Boston on the 12th, that should put us at

          least a week ahead.

                    PULLINGS

          She'll be in for a surprise, Sir.

The pun on the name of their ship was unintentional, but JACK

lets out a great hoot of laughter, shattering the tense,

expectant silence.

                    JACK

          In for a "Surprise". Now that's wit. "In

          for a Surprise". 'Pon my word I shall

          have to tell the Doctor.

He leaves, still laughing. Those on the quarterdeck are more

amused by JACK's unique sense of humour than by the feeble

joke itself.

                    JACK (CONT'D)

              (calls back)

          Don't put her on the reef, Tom.

                    PULLINGS

          I'll try not to, Sir.

13A    INT. STEPHEN'S CABIN

Jack looks around the door

                    JACK

          What do you have there, Stephen?

He enters. Stephen has wired together the thorax of a bird's

skeleton and is suspending lead weights from it

                    STEPHEN

          The breastbone of a frigate bird. Do you

          remark its prodigious strength.

Jack bends forwards into the candle-light, sharing his

friends keen interest in this strange assembly

                    JACK

          I do and I am not in the least surprised,

          for it reminds me of nothing so much as a

          ship under sail. See here the bowsprit.

          Here the mast, and here the backstays

          running aft.

                    STEPHEN

              (adds another weight)

          Ten pounds sixteen ounces. I am preparing

          a paper for the Royal Society.

Jack straightens, moving with care between the bottled

specimens, open books and brass measuring instruments

                    JACK

          I was thinking when our business here is

          finished, we will have to put in to

          Recife for provisions. You may care to

          take a tour round the forests of Brazil,

          botanizing and collecting specimens. An

          anaconda or two. A giant cassowary.

                    STEPHEN

          I should like it of all things, Jack.

          Thankyou.

14.     WIDE ON THE SURPRISE - NIGHT

Time passes. The fog intensifies. White coils of mist drift

and eddy over the glassy sea, RUN FINAL TITLES as the ship

moves slowly through the night.

15-16   (ADDED TO SC 12)

17.     IN THE GREAT CABIN, LATER - NIGHT

The chronometer ticks. The coffee-pot swings on its gimbals.

JACK lies awake in his hanging cot. Finally he gives up

trying to sleep.

                    JACK

          Killick! Killick there! Strong coffee,

          and light along my topcoat.

18.     ON THE QUARTERDECK - NIGHT

JACK on deck again.

                    QUARTERMASTER

          Six bells and all's well.

A hint of daylight to the east. The mist beginning to shift

as an offshore breeze picks up.

                    LEAD-MAN

          90 fathoms, white shelly sand.

                    CALAMY

          Four knots, Sir.

BONDEN is still at the wheel.

                    BONDEN

          Oi reckon as she's liftin' Sir, if you

          feels like putting your ead down.

JACK takes his advice and goes below again.

19. - THE SHIP (TIMELAPSE)

The sky a shade paler. A wind coming up.

20.    ON THE STARBOARD GANGWAY - DAWN

The lookout, VINCENT, peers into the mist.

                    VINCENT

          Starboard gangway ahoy.

HOLLOM, the oldest of the midshipmen, whose watch it now is,

appears at his shoulder.

                    HOLLOM

          What is it, Vincent?

                    VINCENT

          I heard something. A bell.

HOLLOM peers out into the fog, then turns.

                    HOLLOM

          Native fisherman perhaps.

          (shouts) Mr. Calamy!

Midshipman CALAMY comes running forward.

                    HOLLOM (CONT'D)

          The lead, if you please.

Young CALAMY takes the lead, scrambles into the chains at the

bow of the ship and throws out the lead line.

HOLLOM takes up a telescope and searches through the eddies

of fog.

Over HOLLOM's P.O.V. we can hear CALAMY sounding the depth.

                     CALAMY (O.S.)

           Sixty fathoms, white sand!

Hollom folds his telescope

                     HOLLOM

           Well. It can't have been a reef marker.

CALAMY, unconvinced, checks through his own telescope

                     HOLLOM (CONT'D)

           False alarm Mr CALAMY

CALAMY ignores him, still scanning

21.   TELESCOPE POV

The telescope pans. A dark shape in the distance. The mist

parts a little. A ship. Coming straight toward them.

Close on CALAMY as he turns to camera, screaming -

                     CALAMY

           Enemy on the larboard bow! Beat to

           quarters!

22. JACK'S SLEEP CABIN

JACK instantly awake, piling out of his bed, still dressed.

23.     BERTH-DECK - DAWN

A drum blazes as the off-duty watch tumble out of their

hammocks and run to their battle stations.

24. COCKPIT, ORLOP DECK

Rows of wicked-looking instruments are hastily thrown on the

operating table by PADEEN, MATURIN's servant - saws,

retractors and knives glistening in the lamp-light.

DR. MATURIN hurries in blinking sleep out of his eyes as he

ties on his black apron - behind him, HIGGINS, the assistant

surgeon.

25.   POWDER MAGAZINE

Little ADDISON and his team of powder-monkeys run with their

boxes of gunpowder to the...

26. GUN-DECK

As LAMB, NAGEL and the other carpenters bash down cabin

partitions, transforming the entire gun-deck into a single

continuous space, from the bows to the Captain's Great Cabin

in the stern.

As the crews swarm about their guns, grotesque shadows are

thrown on the walls and ceiling by the numerous battle-

lanterns arriving to illuminate the scene.

27. WEATHER-DECK

JACK and PULLINGS stride the length of the deck toward the

bow [ ] . They pass crews manning the carronades while

others swing the ship's small boats out and over the side to

be towed behind the ship.

28. FORECASTLE

JACK and PULLINGS join HOLLOM.

                    JACK

          Where away?

CALAMY points forward and a little to the left of the

Surprise's bow.

                    CALAMY

          Not two miles distant, Sir.

JACK and PULLINGS stare through telescopes into the fog,

which is beginning to lift. JACK lowers his telescope.

                    JACK

          Mr. Hollom?

                    HOLLOM

          I saw nothing, nor heard anything either.

          Shall I ask them men to stand down?

JACK steps closer to the bow, and again lifts his telescope.

29. TELESCOPE P.O.V

A slow pan across the sea, past a darker patch of fog. What

was that? The lens pans back toward the darker area to see a

series of flashes.

30. CLOSE ON JACK

He turns and shouts to the crew -

                     JACK

           Lie down! Everybody lie down!

His words are underscored by a series of distant explosions,

followed by a deep rumble, then a tearing, howling sound.

31. ANGLE ON THE SKY

Chain shot and grape, bar and canister shriek through the

air. A blizzard of iron.

32. ON THE DECK

The crew hit the deck, the last to drop is BONDEN hanging

grimly to the wheel.

33. MIDSHIPMAN BLAKENEY

Close, as he tries to bury himself in the deck timbers.

34. DELETED

35. DELETED.

36. QUARTERDECK

The broadside hits the bows and a cloud of splinters and

metal scythes the length of the deck at head height. This is

rapidly followed by billowing smoke from a small fire now

burning on the forecastle.

CALAMY is working at putting the fire out as JACK issues a

stream of orders.

                     JACK

           Run out the guns! Marines to the tops,

           and get that wounded man below!

He pulls a gold watch from his pocket and checks the time.

36A.   GUN DECK

Hollom is nervously supervising a gun crew which includes

DAVIES and his mates.

                     HOLLOM

           ...C-cast loose now... Um swab. That's

           right. Run out your guns.

The men work as a team, largely ignoring Hollom's hesitant

instructions. The shot rack is empty

                     DAVIES

           Shot. There's no shot!

37.   QUARTERDECK (CONTD)

As red-coated marines led by Captain HOWARD climb into the

rigging JACK calls to his clerk -

                     JACK

           Note the time Mr. Watt.

An anxious TOM PULLINGS appears.

                     PULLINGS

           She's out of our range, Sir!

JACK calls to his sailing master, ALLEN.

                     JACK

           Closer, Mr. ALLEN. You must lay me

           alongside her at pistol-shot.

ALLEN purses his lips. He knows what he's doing and slightly

resents the instruction

                     JACK (CONT'D)

           Mr. Pullings - bow-chasers to fire as she

           bears.

38. P.O.V. ENEMY SHIP

She's crossing their bows, about a mile distant.

39. ON DECK

PULLINGS is racing up the larboard gangway to the forecastle,

past men stacking hammocks as blast protection.

40. ON THE FORECASTLE

Gun-captains stand ready, the slow-match burning in the tubs.

                     PULLINGS

           Fire on the uproll.

The little drummer's huge eyes are fixed on PULLINGS' face.

The ship rolls.

                       PULLINGS (CONT'D)

           Fire!

The drum-roll is all but drowned by the blast of the guns.

The smoke clears, the gunners look on baffled as their balls

bounce harmlessly off the side of the enemy ship.

                     OLD SPONGE

               (In Greek)

           Witchcraft!

                     DOUDLE

           Never seen the like of it

                     PULLINGS

           Damn and blast you! See to your guns!

           Fire high! Fire for the masts and

           rigging!

As the enemy's murderous long guns run out again.

41.   WIDE ON THE ENEMY SHIP

Her French ensign clearly visible as she swings broadside on

to the approaching Surprise - again her side lights up in a

series of red flashes.

42.   IN THE COCKPIT

By the dim light of a battle-lantern STEPHEN struggles to

hold a wounded man on the table, his feet slipping in pools

of blood on the deck.

                     STEPHEN

           More sand on the floor, Mr. Higgins!

The slightly hung-over HIGGINS reaches for the sand bucket

and is thrown over by the awful jarring shock as the

Acheron's third broadside hits home.

43.   IN THE GREAT CABIN -

The Captain's crockery smashes to the deck. KILLICK, cursing

freely, stows what he can.

44.   IN THE ORLOP

Shards of timber implode, followed by a great spout of water

knocking the massive AWKWARD DAVIES sideways as he runs for

the ladder carrying two cannon-balls.

A second explosion, a second jet of water and DAVIES, finding

his feet, starts yelling for the carpenter.

                       DAVIES

             Wood and Lead! Mr Nagel! Mr Lamb!!

45. STAIRS

Follow DAVIES as he runs up to the gun-deck with the shot

under his arms past the powder-monkeys ADDISON and SWIFT,

canisters of gun-powder slung over their shoulders, then he

sees MR. LAMB, the carpenter.

                       DAVIES

             Orlop! We're holed!

As LAMB dives for the ladder.

46.   ON THE GUN-DECK

DAVIES arrives to find a gaping hole opposite where his own

gun once stood. Its crew lie scattered, horribly wounded or

dead.

The dismounted gun and twelve pound shot are rolling around

dangerously. HOLLOM, the sole survivor, is backed against

the bulkhead, cradling an injured arm.

CALAMY emerges from the smoke, meets DAVIES's horror-struck

gaze and takes command.

                       CALAMY

             Davies! Get those bodies overboard!

                 (to HOLLOM)

             Mr. Hollom sir!

HOLLOM sits immobilized by fear. CALAMY grabs the poulterer,

JEMMY DUCKS, who has been rescuing the ship's goat, Aspasia.

                       CALAMY (CONT'D)

             Jemmy - leave the damned goat and take

             Mr. Hollom below.

                        JEMMY DUCKS

           Aye, sir!

The ship heels as she turns.

Midshipman BLAKENEY, Calamy's rival in the game of marbles,

turns to see the dismounted gun rolling free. He throws a

hammock net under it, stopping its roll before it crushes

CALAMY against the bulkhead.

CALAMY shoots him a brief look of gratitude and runs aft.

BLAKENEY carries on shouting to the powder-monkeys -

                     BLAKENEY

           More shot! More cartridge!

47.   HULL OF THE SURPRISE

In the great jagged hole on the gun-deck where the gun was

destroyed, JACK stands framed, a wrathful soot-stained

figure. He glances back at his men, hunched and ready,

itching to fire.

                     JACK (bellows)

           Steady... Wait for it!

48. WIDE ON THE BATTLE

to see the two ships about to pass abreast, the Surprise

heading south as it were, the enemy ship, north.

The French vessel is clearly the bigger ship, and from both

come the sounds of shouted orders and the thunder of drums.

They will pass broadside to broadside, 500 yards apart.

49.   GUN-DECK, SURPRISE

JACK watching the enemy, judging the moment.

                     JACK

           ...wait WAIT! And FIRE!

The great guns go off all together. The cannons leaping back

between their crews. JACK snatches a powder-monkey, ADDISON,

out of the way of the lethal recoil.

50.   QUARTERDECK

Smoke clears to reveal holes in the enemy's foretopsail, a

bowline hanging loose, but again many of her balls have

failed to penetrate the enemy timbers.

                     BONDEN

           By all that's holy what is that ship made

           of?

His question coincides with a third full broadside from the

Frenchman. The Surprise's wheel shattered. BONDEN thrown

aside, MR. WATT jerked back to the taffrail, the mizzenmast

hit.

A rope sheers and JOE PLAICE is smacked on the skull by a

swinging boom.

Midshipman BLAKENEY, running up on deck, goes to help PLAICE

and is struck down by a flying splinter - a shocking wound to

his upper right arm.

51. COMPANIONWAY

JACK is half-way up the ladder when he falls, scored across

the forehead by a musket-ball.

Eyesight blurred. Hearing gone. He is dimly aware of small

arms cracking above his head, and someone trying to lift him.

                     JACK

           Belay there ye poxed son of a whore!

                     MOWETT

           You must go below, Sir, you must let me

           help you below!

JACK puts a hand to his bleeding forehead and drags himself

back up the ladder.

52. IN THE TOPS

A furious exchange of fire between CAPTAIN HOWARD's marines

and the sharpshooters in the enemy's rigging.

Howard, a big red-faced man, is in his element, laughing

madly every time he scores a hit.

53. QUARTERDECK

JACK emerges into bloody chaos: screams of the wounded all

around, the enemy ship moving astern in mist and gun-smoke.

He wipes blood from his eye as he raises his telescope.

54/55.   TELESCOPE P.O.V.

As the ship passes, her name is visible on the transom -

Acheron.

                     PULLINGS V.O

           Sir....

Jack lowers his telescope. Pullings' expression spells

catastrophe

                     PULLINGS

           It's the rudder.

56.   STERN OF THE SURPRISE

Grim-faced, JACK hobbles to the shattered taff-rail, sees

BONDEN soaked, having climbed down onto the stern-post.

                     BONDEN

               (shouts up)

           It's shot away below the waterline!

58. COCKPIT

STEPHEN, up to his armpits in blood, operating on a wounded

man, looks up to see three more seriously injured men

arriving.

He pauses, aware of some change.

                     STEPHEN

           Why are we not firing?

57.   GUN-DECK

Spirals of drifting smoke. Blackened bleeding men, their guns

pointing at nothing

                     FASTER DOUDLE

           No steerage.

                     NEHEMIAH SLADE

           We're fish in a barrel

59.   HIGH SHOT

The fog has rolled back, like a great curtain, to reveal the

two frigates.

The badly damaged Surprise, drifting rudderless.

The Acheron, most of her sails intact, beginning the turn

which will put her in position to finish off the Surprise.

60. QUARTERDECK

JACK is joined by ALLEN as the enemy vessel starts crossing

their wake.

                     ALLEN

           He's coming about, Sir.

                     MOWETT

           Should I strike the colours?

All eyes on Jack, poised on the brink of awful defeat.

                     ALLEN

           I'm afraid there's nothing else for it.

JACK looks from the wall of fog to the three little boats

they are towing astern.

                     JACK

           Damned if there ain't. We'll tow her.

61.   STERN OF THE SURPRISE

Sudden feverish activity, running and shouting as men

scramble down into the boats. DAVIES settles himself beside

NAGEL in the cutter, turning to look at the approaching

Acheron.

His P.O.V.: puffs of smoke from its bow-chasers.

                     PULLINGS

           Sail trimmers away, Warley, make what

           sail you can!

                     JACK

           Stern-chasers to fire when she's in

           range!

62.   STERN OF SURPRISE

Gouts of water from the enemy gunfire rise not fifty yards

from them, acting as little needed encouragement for the

boats to get clear of the stern and pull around towards the

bows as....

64.   MAINMAST/FOREMAST

Men scramble up the ratlines, and through the shattered

rigging.

65.   THE GREAT CABIN

Two long brass nine-pounders set up through the open windows

of the Captain's day cabin, open fire on the approaching

Acheron.

                        MOWETT

           Fire!

65A. MAINMAST

WARLEY, captain of the maintop, directs his men about the

mare's nest of rigging, getting a tattered top-sail to fill

with what little breeze there is.

                     WARLEY

           Sharp now with that fancy-line! To the

           clew line from the reef points, Cully,

           double up and run her back again!

66. QUARTERDECK

Through PULLINGS' telescope: the enemy ship coming straight

at them, her guns now getting the range of the Surprise.

                     PULLINGS

           She's gaining on us.

                     JACK

           Start the water, carronades over the

           side.

67.   ANGLE ON THE QUARTERDECK

Crewmen furiously at work cutting the ropes securing the guns

on the quarterdeck.

68.   ANGLE ON THE STERN

Water spouts from the pumps, while at the same time the

quarterdeck guns tumble into the ocean.

(NOTE: they only abandon guns on the quarterdeck, not their

main armament on the gun-deck.)

69. FORECASTLE

JACK races to the bows. Towlines strain as the three small

boats pull the great ship toward the curtain of fog and

cloud. He yells to the straining oarsmen -

                     JACK

           Pull! Pull for your lives.

70.   ANGLE FROM THE BOATS

The men heave on their oars, faces bathed in sweat, the

towlines taut behind them, dragging the Surprise toward the

safety of the fog-bank.

71. WIDE

to see the Surprise slipping into the cover of fog and low

cloud, only her top masts visible, before they too disappear.

72. QUARTERDECK

JACK joins his officers looking back into the white-out, in

the direction of the enemy.

                     JACK

           Quiet now. No calls, no shouts. Mr.

           ALLEN, signal the men in the boats to

           head due east.

ALLEN hurries toward the bows, as behind them the fog is

momentarily illuminated by flashes of gunfire from their

pursuer.

73.   THE LEADING JOLLY BOAT

CALAMY, in the prow of the jolly-boat, sees ALLEN on the

ship, signalling the turn to eastward.

CALAMY signals to BONDEN in the stern of the jolly-boat.

                     BONDEN

               (urgent whisper)

           Starboard haul. And stroke! Stroke!

One side stops rowing and the boat turns.

74.   THE SURPRISE

A low angle, the ship coming slowly toward us.

Beyond, the rowers strain at their oars, the great ship

rearing out of the mist above them, as though carried on

their backs.

75.   QUARTERDECK OF THE SURPRISE

Somewhere astern and to the left JACK can hear shouting on

the Acheron. Flashes of cannon fire, directed away from them.

                     PULLINGS

           He's beating inshore.

                     JACK

           Keep rowing

76 MASTS OF THE SURPRISE, (TIMELAPSE) - NIGHT

The tortured sounds of exhausted men rowing as skeins of mist

drift away to reveal a dim, yellow moon. On the horizon the

battered ship in silhouette, lines stretching ahead to her

three small boats.

77 QUARTERDECK OF THE SURPRISE - NIGHT

Some of the wreckage has been cleared aside, the wounded

moved below. We can hear their moans, and the constant

creaking of the bilge pumps.

JACK and his officers scan the moonlit sea through

telescopes.

JACK's telescope POV: A long slow pan along the dark horizon.

                     ALLEN

           I believe we've lost her, Sir.

JACK collapses his telescope.

                     JACK

           Pass the word to ship oars

78 IN THE JOLLY BOATs. - NIGHT

The rowers slump forwards in their seats, their hands raw and

crabbed.

79 STAIRWELL - NIGHT

JACK moves down a ladder past LAMB coming up from below,

soaking wet and exhausted with his mate Nagel.

                    LAMB

          Three feet of water in the hold, Sir, but

          the pumps are keeping it from gaining.

                    JACK

          Very good, Mr. Lamb.

The constant creaking and sloshing of the pumps becomes

louder as he continues down past men handing up food and

powder from the flooded levels below.

81. SICK-BAY

Stephen, his face spattered with blood, is adjusting the wick

of a lantern when Jack arrives beside him

                    JACK

              (sotto)

          What's the butchers bill?

                    STEPHEN

          Six dead, thirteen wounded.

He notices the gash on Jack's forehead

          Your head ...

                    JACK

              (Brushes him away)

          Later.

STEPHEN raises his lantern to reveal groaning bloodstained

men close-packed in the gloom.

Together they make the rounds, passing men propped upright by

their mates, pale with shock or tense with pain, some

struggling to breathe, some barely alive.

JACK clasps hands, whispers encouragement.

A bandaged head swims into the glow of the lamp, streaked

with blood and deeply unconscious.

                    JACK (CONT'D)

          Who's this - Joe Plaice?

                    STEPHEN

              (sotto)

          A severe depressed fracture of the

          skull. I am not sure he will see out the

          night.

Moving on to another barely recognizable face: young

Blakeney, pale and sweaty, breathing hard from the pain and

the blood loss.

                    JACK

          Mr. Blakeney?

                    BLAKENEY

          Just a broken arm, Sir.

JACK looks at STEPHEN, whose expression is grim, but he says

nothing, steering Jack forward to the foot of the ladder

where they can speak more privately

                    STEPHEN

          I will do everything possible. I know you

          were close to his father.

Jack nods, defeat weighing heavily, and makes to go. Stephen

puts a restraining hand on his shoulder.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)

          One moment Jack let me look at that brow

          of yours.

                    JACK

          Its a scratch.

                    STEPHEN

          I will tell you if its a scratch or not.

          Sit down.

Jack submits meekly, and sits on a lower rung while Stephen

puts a bandage round his forehead

                    JACK

          How did he find us Stephen?

          Seven weeks sailing and he happened in

          darkness on our exact position. Its

          uncanny. He really is a phantom

                    STEPHEN

          Unless she was alerted to our presence,

          and looking for us.

                    JACK

          Tosh. How could that be?

                    STEPHEN

          The French have their spies, in Britain

          as elsewhere.

                     JACK (astonished)

          You're saying there are traitors in the

          Admiralty?

                    STEPHEN

          I am saying do not imagine it was a lone

          privateer who did this to us. He is

          working for Napoleon himself, with access

          to all that tyrant commands, overtly and

          covertly. So do not let defeat weigh too

          heavily upon you.

82.    THE GREAT CABIN - DAWN

Wan dawn light reflects off the ceiling onto the bloody,

bandaged officers, conducting an angry post-mortem as KILLICK

serves coffee.

                    ALLEN

          ...Call her a frigate? Ha! You ask me

          she's no more a frigate than a painted

          Dutchman. More like a ship of the line, a

          two-decker more'n a frigate.

MOWETT is trying to staunch a persistent nosebleed.

                    MOWETT

          One does wonder what manner of hull she

          has. Our balls seemed to bounce right off

          her.

Jack enters, his head newly bandaged. He walks past the

seated officers and stands looking out through the stern

windows. The officers continue their conversation, though

their words are intended for Jack

                    PULLINGS

          She had the weather-gauge and long

          eighteens which could hit us beyond our

          effective range. That's the sum of it

                     ALLEN

          And   40 guns to our 28, I counted the

          muzzle flashes.

                    PULLINGS

          It was an unfair match, no dishonor in

          defeat no dishonor at all.

Jack still has his back to them. He puts his hand in his

pocket and finds something there - the shattered fragments of

his gold pocket watch.

                    ALLEN

              (sighs)

          Well, we can patch up our main and mizzen

          the foresail is too far gone so we'll

          bend our spare.

                      PULLINGS

          Sir.

Jack finally turns.

                    PULLINGS (CONT'D)

          Mr. Allen is confident, with basic

          repairs, we can get home as we are...

          allowing for a stop in Jamaica.

                     ALLEN

          At Port Royal we can haul her into dry-

          dock, and hopefully get her home

          without...

                    JACK

          We're not going home.

An expectant hush. KILLICK is all ears, as he picks up the

coffee cups and places them carefully on a silver tray.

                    JACK (CONT'D)

          What is our purpose here gentlemen? Why

          were we sent? To punish a blackguard

          privateer who has decimated our Atlantic

          whaling fleet and now threatens to do the

          same in the pacific. Are we to leave

          those ships to his mercy and slink back

          into Portsmouth - another defeat to add

          to the list. Is that what we draw our

          wages for? I say we pursue her and pay

          her back with interest

                    ALLEN

          With respect, Captain, she could be half-

          way to Cape Horn by the time we're

           repaired and underway.

                     JACK

               (sternly)

           Then there's not a moment to lose.

83.   OUTSIDE THE GREAT CABIN

KILLICK exits the cabin with the tray of coffee cups. As he

passes them to his mate, BLACK BILL -

                     KILLICK (a whisper)

           We're for the Horn.

84.     THROUGHOUT THE SHIP - DAWN

Word passes like lightning from the wounded in the orlop, to

the beak of the ship

                      MUTTERED VOICES AD LIB

           -   The Horn you say?

           -   Never! In this condition?

           -   Eh? What news mates

           -   Heading for where?!

85.     FORECASTLE - DAWN

A few of the old 'Surprises' have gathered for a smoke, all

of them men who've sailed with JACK before: Jittery alcoholic

Higgins, loyal Nehemiah Slade, sharp-faced tobacco-chewing

Faster Doudle, and the big Welshman Awkward Davies, still

shaken by the loss of his gun-crew.

                     higgins

           We're for hell in a hand-barrow if you

           ask my opinion

                     slade

           I'm game. If the captain says we can take

           her we can take her.

                     DAVIES

           Can we catch her is the question.

           And if we do what's different? She'll

           just hold us off with them long eighteens

           til she sends us all to the bottom. All

           for what?

                     DOUDLE

           I'll tell you for what, matey. She's a

           privateer, loaded with all the gems of

           Araby. Think of the gold. Think of the

           prize-money.

                     HOLLAR

           Hoi there! You men jump to it!

86.     WAIST OF THE SHIP - NOON

The gratings are hauled aside and light floods down into the

gun-deck.

87.     GUN-DECK - DAY

Part of a huge tree-trunk - spare timber for repairs - is

manhandled by a dozen crewmen.

                     HOLLAR

           Heave. And heave. Handsomely now. One

           long pull. Belay!

88.     QUARTERDECK - DAY

Crewmen labour at the capstan.

                     HOLLAR (O.S.)

           Two six heave! Two six heave!

The huge log rises from below and hangs suspended from its

gantry. JACK shouts down from the quarterdeck -

                     JACK

           Have her placed along the gunwale for

           now, Mr. Hollar, and the guns moved to

           that side also.

89.   ABOVE JACK'S HEAD

Men are hanging in the rigging throwing down damaged sections

of rope.

                     FASTER DOUDLE

           All clear below!

90.     QUARTERDECK - DAY

JACK dodges the falling rope, moving back, past NAGEL and his

men who are cutting out damaged sections of the gunwale with

saws and adzes, prizing up decking and wrestling with the

wrecked steering mechanism.

91.     THE STERN - DAY

JACK looks down to where PULLINGS and others have lifted the

broken rudder from its hinges.

92.    WIDE SHOT - DAY

The ship swarming with men, cutting, splicing, hammering and

hauling. Every able-bodied soul hard at work.

93.    QUARTERDECK - DAY

An optimistic breeze has picked up, fluttering the tattered

ensign.

The deck is now sloping at a forty-five degree angle. KILLICK

hands a sandwich to Pullings who passes it down to JACK.

                    JACK

          Damn this wind, Mr. Pullings! The Acheron

          will be making a hundred and fifty miles

          a day in this.

                    PULLINGS

          Aye, but hugging the coast, and stopping

          to board the odd merchantman

JACK smiles at this and bites into his sandwich.

To the uphill side, carpenters are erecting a scaffolding

over the side of the ship.

94.    THE SHIP - DAY

The ship's copper-plated keel is partly revealed as the men

clamber and slip about on the steeply-sloping side erecting

scaffolding. The tropical heat resounds with shouts, curses

and hammering.

95.    SIDE OF THE SHIP - DUSK

Carpenters working inside the scaffolding, are fitting new

sections of wood into the holes low in her hull.

                    LAMB

          Down. Down. Stop.

The new piece of wood is an almost perfect fit. MR. LAMB

marks the places where it is jamming.

                      LAMB (CONT'D)

          Up again.

Then he begins to work on it with his rasp.

96.    UNDERWATER - DUSK

Among tropical fish, a diver, a Greek crewman, 'OLD

SPONGE' (father of YOUNG SPONGE) a hammer at his belt, plugs

a few smaller holes with hemp fibre, then surfaces to...

97.    THE SIDE OF THE CUTTER - DUSK

                    OLD SPONGE

              (In Greek)

          The smaller bit. No. That bit there.

YOUNG SPONGE passes him a piece of lead and some nails and

OLD SPONGE dives again.

Our P.O.V. descending into the sea as...

98.    WAIST OF THE SHIP - NIGHT

Roaring flames, flying sparks, the clang of metal on metal. A

forge has been set up. Powder-monkeys sweat on the bellows.

The ship's blacksmith is churning out iron bolts, pintles and

gudgeons, which are snatched away by NAGEL with tongs and

thrown into a bucket of water to cool.

A few yards away, wood chips fly from LAMB's adze as the

ship's massive new stern post takes shape.

The new rudder is laid out flat, already cut to its final

shape and being strengthened with great nails and iron bands

which NEHEMIAH SLADE and AWKWARD DAVIES are nailing into

place.

The hammering travels through the ship to...

99.    THE SICK BERTH - NIGHT

BLAKENEY with his splinted arm jerks awake, feverish and

confused.

                    BLAKENEY

          No. No. Not through my nose!

                    CALAMY

          Its alright. William. You were dreaming.

Blakeney looks around, disoriented and finds Calamy by his

side.

                    BLAKENEY

          Joe Plaice told me when you die they sew

          you up in your hammock with the last

          stitch through your nose... to make sure

          you're not just sleeping

                    CALAMY

          You know old Joe, always telling [ ]

          stories.

                    BLAKENEY

          Is it true though? [    ] About the last

          stitch?

                    CALAMY

          Come on, you'll be stitching me in mine

          first.

                    BLAKENEY (drifting)

          Not through my nose. You'll tell them.

                     CALAMY

              (nods)

          Nor any other part of you.

Trying to make light of it, though he fears BLAKENEY is

dying.

100.       SICK BAY, LATER - NIGHT

CALAMY has fallen asleep by BLAKENEY's side. He wakes to find

STEPHEN sniffing BLAKENEY's wound.

                    CALAMY

          Is it mending, sir?

                    STEPHEN

          No, I'm afraid it will not do.

101.        THE COCKPIT - NIGHT

BLAKENEY is lowered onto the table, delirious. CALAMY holds

his head and PADEEN, MATURIN's giant manservant, his legs,

which are lashed together.

                    BLAKENEY

          No. Mamma. Mamma.

                    STEPHEN

          It is the laudanum speaking. You will be

          a regular Nelson.

He tests the edge of his knife with his thumb.

CALAMY places the leather gag between BLAKENEY's teeth.

Padeen mumbles a Gaelic prayer. STEPHEN turns and grips

BLAKENEY shattered arm.

A sharp, grating noise as STEPHEN works out of shot, cutting

off the arm.

Close on STEPHEN, lips compressed, utterly focussed.

He puts down the bloody knife and reaches for the spatula in

the pail of hot tar.

BLAKENEY has not uttered a sound, though he is shaking

uncontrollably and his face is wet with tears. CALAMY has

tears in his eyes also.

STEPHEN finishes his work, breathing hard, a gentle smile to

BLAKENEY.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)

          There. I have never seen a braver

          patient.

102.        SICK-BERTH - NIGHT

An exhausted CALAMY keeps vigil by BLAKENEY's cot. The boy

wakes, and looks for CALAMY in the darkness.

                    BLAKENEY

          Peter? Is that you? I dreamed they cut my

          arm off.

Then he realizes, with sudden horror, that it wasn't a dream

                    CALAMY

          You would have died else.

Blakeneys eyes brim with tears and he turns away

                    CALAMY (CONT'D)

          Come. You can still sup your grog with

          your left. And I shall take your turn at

          marbles.

103.        MIZZEN TOPGALLANT - DAY

MOWETT stands in the cross-trees, making a final check on the

lashings round the new mizzen top. Below him the great work

is nearing completion, men swarming like ants over every part

of the hull.

MOWETT climbs down past FASTER DOUDLE who has one leg looped

through the shrouds and is splicing a rope with both hands

and his teeth.

Farther down, a patched sail is being furled up tight in its

gaskets.

Beyond that, at the base of the main-mast a fascinated group

of men have gathered to watch the Doctor trepanning JOE

PLAICE.

104.        BASE OF THE MAINMAST - DAY

STEPHEN's drill carves out a neat disc of bone to reveal a

purplish mass which he starts spooning from the cavity.

A small crowd of crewmen pause in their work, watching the

doctor with morbid fascination as he drops the purple stuff

in a dish.

                    SLADE (shouts)

          Is them his brains, Doctor?

                    STEPHEN

          No, that is just blood. These are his

          brains.

Exposing them to view. Several of the crew move in for a

closer look. The armourer hands STEPHEN a flattened coin,

which he begins to screw in place over the cavity as the old

hands whisper his praises to the men who have never seen

Stephen at work.

                    SLADE

          Physician he is, not one of your common

          surgeons.

                    FASTER DOUDLE

          Cured Prince Billy of the marthambles and

          the strong fives, wouldn't look at you

          for under ten guineas on land.

                    DAVIES

          [   ] Knows his birds and beasts too

          boyo, show him a beetle and he'll tell

          you what it's thinking.

105.           THE SURPRISE - DAY

A wind causes the ship to turn on its moorings, stirring

impatiently, like a racehorse ready to be off as...

106.           QUARTERDECK - DAY

...JACK jumps down from the mizzen ratlines.

                    JACK

          Let us be off, Mr. Allen!

                    ALLEN

          Weigh anchor! All hands to make sail. Mr

          Hollom!

107. ON DECK

Barefoot men are suddenly running to their stations, racing

above and below, running out along the bowsprit, up the

ratlines, along the yards.

A small group, supposed to be assisting Hollom, are

contrasting slow off the mark

                    HOLLOM

          Bear a hand there you fellows!

The men he is addressing, shoot him a look of distaste which

unsettles Hollom slightly, then they assist him pulling on a

rope

108.       QUARTERDECK - DAY

                    MOWETT

          Up and down Sir, thick and dry for

          weighing.

109.           WAIST OF THE SHIP - DAY

Men strain on the capstan bars.

110.           BOWS - DAY

The anchor bursting up out of the sea.

111.           MASTS OF THE SURPRISE - DAY

The shrouds darken with climbing figures, framed against the

sun.

                    HOLLAR (O.S.)

          Trice up. Lay out.

          Sheet home!

          Hoist away!

112.        QUARTERDECK - DAY

HOLLAR staring up as the sails unfurl and fill with wind.

                    HOLLAR

          Cheerly there in the foretop, our

          William!

          T'garnsl sheets!

          Hands to the braces!

Men slide down ropes from high amongst the shrouds, then

swing out and drop down to the deck like monkeys, pulling

ropes and sails tight with the weight of their bodies.

113.        WIDE SHOT - DAY

The ship spreading its wings. A sudden cracking of canvas as

she turns and runs directly downwind.

114.        QUARTERDECK - LATE AFTERNOON

The sun has sunk lower. BONDEN, solid as the rock of

Gibraltar is back at the helm, the wind stronger and directly

behind.

                    JACK

          Speed, Mr. Boyle

BOYLE heaves the log clear of the ship's side. The log line

races out on its reel. BOYLE checks the run, pulls the pin.

                    BOYLE

          Ten and a half knots, Sir.

JACK makes no comment but the news seems to please him.

115.        CLOSE TO THE WATER - DUSK

The great hull powers past us.

116.   DELETED

117.        OUTSIDE THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT

KILLICK prepares toasted cheese in his small serving-area.

From inside the cabin, the sound of a violin and a cello

tuning up. KILLICK glances irritably at the door and elbows

his mate, BLACK BILL.

                    KILLICK

          Here we go again: scrape, scrape,

          screech, screech and never a tune you

          could dance to, not if you were drunk as

          Davey's sow.

118.    INSIDE THE GREAT CABIN

JACK and STEPHEN are both keen amateur musicians - JACK,

violin, STEPHEN cello.

As Stephen completes his tuning, Jack experiments with a

refrain.

                    STEPHEN

          Is that one I know, or are we breaking

          new ground?

                    JACK

          I am trying to remember that air they

          played all those years ago at the

          Governors house in Port Mahon. You

          remember When we first met.

          Corelli if I'm not mistaken.

He plays another riff

                     STEPHEN

          If that is your "A" you are very much so.

          This is A.

Jack corrects his A string, plays another few bars

                    JACK

          Or Locatelli. pom pom pom pom

                    STEPHEN

          All I remember is you being unable to sit

          in your seat the entire performance.

                    JACK

          Aye and you practising apon that poor

          bishop with your "puddings athwart the

          starboard Gumbrils" or some such arrant

          nonsense.

                    STEPHEN

              (laughs)

          No. That was off Toulon, during the

          blockade. At our first meeting they

          played this:

He plays a short refrain

                    JACK

          No. No. Entirely off the mark.   pom-pom-

          POM I have now

He plays another variation

                    STEPHEN

              (enjoying the game)

          Or was it something like this....

Cello answers violin, as they hand it back and forth,

improvising freely now with an infinity of variations,

sometimes playing together, sometimes separately, suddenly

hitting it, the music soaring and continuing over

119.        A HIGH POINT OF VIEW, TIME LAPSE - DAY

The tiny ship on the vastness of the ocean. From its side,

cotton-wool puffs of smoke.

120.        GUN-DECK - SAME TIME

A rippling broadside, the crews sweating over their guns.

                    JACK

          And pitch 'em up! It's spars and rigging

          we want!

MOWETT timing the gap between each broadside.

                    MOWETT

          Three minutes ten, Sir.

                    JACK

          Not good enough! We must fire three

          broadsides to her two. Again!

Turning to BLAKENEY, who though much recovered, still looks

pale and a little unsure of himself.

                    JACK (CONT'D)

          Mr. Blakeney? Think you can supervise a

          gun?

                    BLAKENEY

          As you will. Sir.

                    JACK

          'Spitfire', hop to it.

BLAKENEY takes command of the gun. To one side CALAMY is in

charge of 'Beelzebub', on the other side HOLLOM is now

directing 'Sudden Death'.

Once again the orders are given, and the crews, now competing

with each other, go through the sequence: 'Out Tompions',

'Cast loose your guns', 'Cartridge. Ball. Prime. Run out your

gun. Prime. Aim. Stand clear... Fire!!'

121.        AND AGAIN - DUSK

As another broadside shakes the deck, STEPHEN hauls his

collecting net on board and empties out a glistening array of

sea creatures - shrimps, squid and minnows, glinting like

opals in the pink light.

                    MOWETT (O.S.)

          Two minutes five, Sir.

                    PULLINGS

          Again!

122.        AND AGAIN - NIGHT

It's a race. JACK's orders are just a formality, the sequence

having become so automatic now.

                    JACK

          Out Tompions... Run out your guns...

          Prime.

Seconds ticking away on MOWETT's stopwatch, barrels float on

the sea a hundred yards out.

                    JACK (CONT.) (CONT'D)

          As she bears, from forward aft. Point

          your guns... Fire!!

123.   THE OCEAN AT NIGHT

The black ship spouting tongues of flame, the water around

the target barrels erupting in great spouts.

                    MOWETT (O.S.)

          Two minutes dead.

124.   THE GUNPOWDER ROOM

Boom! Another splendidly coordinated broadside resounds

through the ship as the powder-monkeys come racing down

through the dreadnought screens to the magazine and back with

more cartridge.

For them too it's a race, little ADDISON just ahead of SWIFT,

RYE hot on his heels.

125.        STEPHEN'S CABIN - NIGHT

The sound of the guns is faint down here, at least when heard

from STEPHEN's perspective - his ears are stuffed with wax.

He is surrounded by his specimen bottles, and he looks from

his microscope to his ledger where he is documenting the

array of aquatic life-forms. He removes his ear-plugs, but

the noise of the guns is deafening and he hastily replaces

them.

126.        ON THE GUN-DECK - NIGHT

MOWETT watches the second hand of his stopwatch, glancing up

as he notes -

The concentrated fury of the men swabbing, ramming, heaving

in, heaving out, firing at a raft this time.

And he stops the watch as the first gun fires.

                    MOWETT

          One minute forty-nine, Sir!

His voice is drowned by the firing of the other guns in close

succession entirely demolishing the raft, the sound mixing

with cheering and the frenzied hammering of Nagel and his

mates as the gun-deck partitions are cheerfully re-erected.

127.        IN THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT

The table is dragged back into place and settings laid for

dinner.

JACK enters, his face flushed with victory.

                    JACK

          Killick? Killick there.

KILLICK appears.

                    JACK (CONT'D)

          What do you have for us tonight?

                    KILLICK

          Which it's, Soused Hoggs-Face.

                    JACK

          Aah! My favorite.

128.        MAIN DECK - NIGHT

The sky a great canopy of stars, the ship racing onwards

through the warm night.

Crew men and the recovering wounded have come up on deck. Now

they sit around in groups, supping their grog. Someone

produces a jaw-harp, someone else a drum.

A guitar is passed from hand to hand, stopping with BLACK

BILL who sings a ballad in an African dialect.

There's an effortless integration of race and rank, of age

and nationality - bonds forged by battle and hardship.

OLD SPONGE gets up and dances a Greek dance: obviously a

favorite among the crew. Cheering and cat-calls. Lanterns

coming up from below. More dancing, insults in many

languages, and a song.

                    GUN-CREWS

          Boneparte Boneparte

          That red-faced son of an old French fart

          Hey ho, stamp and go

          Stamp and go, stamp and go

          Hey ho, stamp and go

129.        THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT

The singing mixes with the end of a lively dinner given by

JACK for his officers, including a special guest, young

BLAKENEY.

                    PULLINGS

          With your permission, Sir, Mr. Mowett has

          composed a short poem in honour of our

          mission.

                    JACK

          Let's hear it, Mr. Mowett.

Reactions around the table, glasses re-filled in

anticipation. MOWETT stands and declaims with a number of

precise airy gestures, like a conductor.

                    MOWETT

          Our brotherhood, some old, some new.

          In blood baptized, in strength renewed.

          In purpose unified and true.

          All thoughts of home forsaken.

          Where duty leads us, there we go.

          Nor rest nor comfort shall we know.

          Until the unrepentant foe, is boarded

          sunk or taken

                    ALL

              (raising their glasses)

          Aye! Capital! Well said! Hear him, hear

          him! 'Sunk or taken'...

                    JACK

          Aye and when we do take her we shall give

          her to Tom Pullings as his first command.

          If he don't die before then. Bumpers up

          Tom

                    ALLEN

              (A toast)

          'To wives and sweethearts'.

They raise their glasses -

                    ALL

          'To wives and sweethearts'.

                    PULLINGS

          And may they never meet.

Amid the laughter someone bumps Blakeney's stump. He winces,

then puts a brave face on it

                    BLAKENEY (to JACK)

          I believe you knew Nelson, Sir?

                     JACK

          Lord Nelson? Yes. I had the honour of

          serving under him at the Nile.

               (aside)

          Mr. Mowett, the bottle stands by you,

          sir.

               (as the bottle moves on)

          In fact I dined with him twice, and he

          spoke to me on both occasions.

The table goes quiet. BLAKENEY is wide-eyed, though partly

from his strenuous efforts to appear sober.

                    JACK (CONT.) (CONT'D)

          The first time he said to me - 'May I

          trouble you for the salt, sir?' I have

          always tried to say it as close as I

          could [   ] The second time someone had

          offered him a boat-cloak on a cold night

          and he said no, he was quite warm - his

          zeal for his king and country kept him

          warm.

Amid the general agreement - 'Hear him, hear him', etc.

STEPHEN is noticeably silent.

                    JACK (CONT'D)

          It sounds absurd, I know, and were it

          another man you would cry out, "Oh, what

          pitiful stuff" and dismiss it as mere

          enthusiasm, but with him you felt your

          heart glow.

                    MOWETT

              (raising his glass)

          To Lord Nelson.

                    ALL

          Lord Nelson!

[ ] Stephen joins on the toast, but JACK knows that his

friend deplores such overt patriotism and seeks to draw him

back in with a joke.

                    JACK

          You see those two weevils, Doctor?

He points at a faint movement amongst the crumbs of a ship's

biscuit.

                    STEPHEN

          I do.

                    JACK

          Which would you choose?

The table tenses with anticipation of one of the Captain's

'jokes'. STEPHEN concentrates.

                    STEPHEN

          There is not a scrap of difference. They

          are the same species of curculio.

                    JACK

          But suppose you had to choose?

                    STEPHEN

          Then I would choose the right-hand

          weevil, it has a perceptible advantage in

          both length and breadth.

                    JACK

          There I have you. You are completely

          dished. Don't you know in the Navy you

          must always choose 'the lesser of two

          weevils'?

He thunders with laughter, the rest joining in, breathless

with mirth, tears of laughter streaming down their faces

                    ALLEN

          'Pon my life. He who would pun would pick

          a pocket. Dye not smoke it doctor?

                    STEPHEN

              (poker faced)

          Sure there would be some poor thin barren

          minds that would catch at such a paltry

          clench.

Then he too cracks a smile and joins in their laughter

130.        MAIN DECK - NIGHT

The crew continue with their own celebration.

The excitement penetrates JOE PLAICE's stupor. Never having

woken since the trepanning he suddenly opens his eyes and

speaks.

                    PLAICE

          "...And the righteous shall inherit the

          earth."

The men around him stare in amazement.

                    BONDEN

          You hear that. He said something. Joe

          spoke! Say something else Joe

                     JOE

           Handy with that gasket

                     BONDEN

               (shouts up to the quarterdeck)

           He spoke doctor. Joe plaice spoke

131. QUARTERDECK

The officers have appeared on deck with their coffee and

Stephen raises a hand in acknowledgment.

132.   IN THE RIGGING - NIGHT

Midshipmen CALAMY RYE and BOYLE are eating from a bag of

broken biscuits ('ships nuts') as they sit perched up in the

rigging.

On seeing JACK, they break into their own song.

                     MIDSHIPMEN

           Our captain was very good to us.

           He dipped his prick in phosphorus.

           It shed a light all through the night.

           And steered us through the Bosphorus.

133. QUARTERDECK

JACK pretends not to have heard, but he can't hide his smile.

Beside him in a chair sits BLAKENEY, his empty jacket sleeve

pinned to his front 'Nelson' style, laughing incredulously at

the older boys cheek.

From somewhere on the forecastle, WARLEY and his top-men

start singing.

                     TOP-MEN

           Farewell and adieu you fine Spanish

           ladies Farewell and adieu to you ladies

           of Spain...

The older midshipman, HOLLOM joins in, his fine voice soaring

effortlessly over the others, hijacking their roistering

ballad and converting it to something much more poignant.

                     HOLLOM

           For we've received orders to sail for Old

           England.

           Perhaps we shall never more see you again

His singing is appreciated by STEPHEN on the quarterdeck.

                    STEPHEN

          What a wonderfully true voice Mr. Hollom

          does possess.

134.        IN THE WAIST - NIGHT

KILLICK and NAGEL are less than impressed with HOLLOM and

sing over him, led by ORRAGE the cook.

                    ORRAGE

          Come all you thoughtless young men,

          A warning take by me,

          And never leave your happy homes

          to sail the raging sea.

135.        OCEAN - NIGHT

The Surprise sailing away from us, the chorus drifting across

the darkness.

135a.   OCEAN. DAY

The colours are changing, from the rich hues of the tropics

to the cold muted colours of colder, more southerly climes.

Still the surprise sails on

136.        THE GREAT CABIN - DAY

Fingers trace a course down the east coast of South America.

Another, more detailed chart is placed on top of the first.

                    ALLEN

          This one's by Colnett, Sir. He travelled

          with Captain Cook and carried a pair of

          Arnott's chronometers.

JACK finds their position and marks it with pencil. A knock

on the door. Officers and crew are now dressed according to

the change in climate

                    KILLICK

          Couple of the men to see you, Sir.

                    JACK

              (without looking up)

          Show them in.

The door opens to reveal NAGEL and WARLEY carrying something.

                    JACK (CONT'D)

          What's this?

A scale model of a ship, 15 inches long, perfect in every

detail. Jack takes it, delighted, the name picked out in gold

on the stern - Acheron.

                    NAGEL

          It were Warley's idea, Sir.

                    WARLEY

          I thought she were familiar like, then I

          remembered where I'd seen her - in

          Boston, during the Peace.

                     JACK

          [   ] In Boston?

                    WARLEY (nods)

          Yes, Sir. She's Yankee built. I seen them

          working on her, something right strange

          about her scantlings. Then I seen them

          balls bounce off her an' I got to

          thinking.

                    NAGEL

          If you look here, Sir. One side opens up.

He pulls a side off the model, exposing its construction.

                    WARLEY

          Mister Nagel here done it just like I

          seen her - a third layer 'tween the

          outer and inner ribbing - diagonal

          bracing, see?

                    JACK

          Just like the U.S. Constitution - our 12

          pounders couldn't penetrate except at

          close range.

He passes the model to ALLEN.

                    JACK (CONT'D)

          Killick. Killick, there.

KILLICK enters.

                    JACK (CONT'D)

          An extra ration of rum for these men,

          from my private store.

                    KILLICK

              (shaking his head)

          Which I was saving for Saluting Day, Sir.

                    JACK

          Rouse it up, Killick, and a bottle for

          Mr. ALLEN and me. Let us live whilst

          we're alive!

KILLICK goes to get the bottles

JACK hunkers down to bring his gaze level with the ship, as

though studying its tiny occupants.

                    JACK (CONT'D)

          He's vulnerable here.

He taps the stern windows.

                    JACK (CONT'D)

          Cross her stern, rake her with a

          broadside through her length. But how to

          get close enough? Past those long

          eighteens. That's the devil of it.

136b    SURPRISE QUARTERDECK DAY

The Surprise has stopped level with a Spanish merchantman,

which lies three hundred yards away, headed in the opposite

direction.

The two boats have hove to and are communicating by

megaphone, Stephen translating the Spanish captains words,

                    STEPHEN

          He says they were chased for three days

          till they finally our-ran her. Forty gun

          French privateer headed due south.

                    JACK

          Capital. Thank him and let us be off.

The Spanish captain, already making sail, waves and shouts a

greeting, which Stephen calls back to him.

                    JACK (CONT'D)

          What did he say there?

                    STEPHEN

          A Spanish farewell. "May no new thing

          arrive." New things being generally by

          their nature bad.

137.        STEPHEN'S CABIN - NIGHT

Stephen is with Blakeney, re-bandaging the younger man's

stump. Blakeney looks away, his eyes moving over the doctors

collection of books, learned texts in French Spanish, Greek

and Latin

                    BLAKENEY

          Do you have a manual of exercises sir.

                       STEPHEN

          Exercises?

                    BLAKENEY

          Physical exercises, to make the left arm

          as powerful as the right once was.

                    STEPHEN

          I think that will happen with usage, at

          least to a certain extent.

                    BLAKENEY

          But not completely. I will never be whole

          again, will I?

                    STEPHEN

          No but you will adapt to your new

          situation

          The natural world shows us any number of

          examples of how that is possible.

Blakeney bites his lip

                    BLAKENEY

          You know my father was a great fighting

          captain. It was always his expectation I

          would follow in his footsteps. I worry

          that with this arm I will now be good for

          nothing but book learning and philosophy.

                    STEPHEN

          Ah. Like me you mean.

                     BLAKENEY

               (becoming tearful)

           I cannot use a sextant, cannot tie a knot

           or climb the rigging. Cannot even dress

           myself. What chance to I have now of even

           making first lieutenant.

                      STEPHEN

           You have every chance. You hear me every

           chance. Only the other day I heard the

           captain singing your praises. Your

           courage, your fortitude in battle, your

           skill at logarithms and double elevations

           whatever they may be. And when you are

           rated lieutenant you shall have someone

           to tie your bootlaces for you. Aye and

           help you with your jacket. Here take my

           handkerchief. I believe we are summonsed

           to dinner.

139.         MAIN MAST - DAWN

The maintop captain, WARLEY, shouts to the deck, his breath

forming in the frosty air -

                     WARLEY

           Sail on the larboard bow!

140.   GREAT CABIN/LADDER

JACK throwing on a heavy boat-cloak, running for the ladder,

KILLICK behind him trying to get a scarf about JACK's neck

and a cap on his head.

141.         THE RIGGING - DAWN

Follow JACK as he runs up the ratlines, over the futtock

shrouds, then up the topmast shrouds, finally arriving at the

very top of the mast, to join WARLEY and PULLINGS.

                     JACK

           Where away?

                     PULLINGS

           Hull down, two points off the larboard

           beam.

JACK takes the telescope.

142.   TELESCOPE P.O.V.

Just the tips of masts, the hull below the horizon.

                    WARLEY (O.S.)

          She's a frigate all right, but no way of

          knowing if she be the phantom.

Beyond the distant ship, a line of black clouds.

143.        RIGGING - DAWN

JACK and PULLINGS slide to the deck on parallel back-stays,

as careless as a couple of midshipmen.

144.        QUARTERDECK - DAWN

JACK shouting -

                    JACK

          Set studdingsails and top gallants. Then

          wet the sails and have the idlers placed

          along the rail.

PULLINGS and HOLLAR bark out their orders. Men race to obey.

JACK steps up on the gunwale, spying out the distant ship.

BLAKENEY, nearby, rests his telescope on CALAMY's shoulder,

focussing with his left hand.

                    BLAKENEY

          Is it him, Sir?

                    JACK

          Touch wood, Mr. Blakeney. And I fancy

          she plans to out-run us. Ask Dr. Maturin

          to join us, he loves a good chase.

BLAKENEY goes below. Above, the topmen release more sail

which is tightened by the men on deck hauling on cables.

Those not working sit on a row along the windward gunwale,

like the crew of an ocean racing yacht, to counterbalance the

pull of the sails.

145.        WEATHER-DECK - DAY

Their speed is so great green seas are now sweeping the

forecastle. A man falls and rolls into the scuppers.

                    MOWETT

          Lifelines fore and aft!

                    JACK

          Speed, Mr. Calamy?

CALAMY heaves the lead and reads the log line, then shouts

back to JACK -

                    CALAMY

          Twelve knots, Sir!

146.        THE SURPRISE - DAY

Heeled over under a great press of sail, her copper showing

as she clefts the waves.

147.        FORECASTLE - DAY

Lined up along the starboard rails, the crew look back at

their captain riding the ship like a charioteer, one eye

aloft on the creaking topmost spar.

                    JEMMY DUCKS

          We're cracking on, eh?

                    FASTER DOUDLE

          We'll be cracking off presently if he

          doesn't watch it.

                    SLADE

          No, he knows this ship. He knows what she

          can take.

He touches wood, just the same and looks at Joe Plaice who

gives a meaningful roll of his eyes.

Ahead, the bank of storm clouds loom gunmetal grey.

148.        GREAT CABIN - DAY

PULLINGS knocks and enters, with an anxious looking MR. LAMB,

with whom he has been arguing a point.

                    PULLINGS

          We can just see her topsails. She's made

          her turn westwards.

                    LAMB

          I can't vouch for the mizzen Sir, not

          round Cape Horn.

                     JACK

          I'll not lose her now. Set a course

          westwards.

Both men accept this and leave.

149.        QUARTERDECK (TIMELAPSE) - DAY

The wind has increased considerably, the deck sloping like

the roof of a house, the masts bending like coach-whips.

PULLINGS and LAMB are looking up at the mizzenmast which is

making ominous creaks and groans.

                    JACK

          Mr Hollar, rig preventer backstays. Warps

          and light hawsers to the mastheads.

JACK stares ahead to the darkening sky as they move across a

switchback landscape of massive rolling waves.

                    JACK (CONT'D)

          Better get below, Mr. Pullings!

                       PULLINGS

          What, Sir?

                    JACK (GRINNING)

          Better get some food in you. Before it

          turns nasty.

150.        OCEAN - DAY

Wide to see the two ships. The Surprise and the Acheron with

a mile of sea between them. It's like some great ocean race,

with neither prepared to take in canvas despite the appalling

conditions.

151.        QUARTERDECK - LATER, DAY

They are running fast before a dangerous, following sea: a

landscape of hills and valleys, the whole thing in terrifying

motion.

The forecastle now vanishes in foam with every plunge, rising

each time with water pouring over the waist and spouting from

her scuppers.

KILLICK comes up with the coffee pot inside his jacket. JACK

drinks from the spout, peering ahead into the murk. A wild

unruly part of him is loving this.

Above him, more top-men struggle up the rigging, with the

mast drawing crazy figure of eights on a rushing sky.

152.   BELOW DECKS

The dog watch are wolfing their food, mugs and dinner plates

sliding over the table. Crewmen walk up hill to the grog

barrel, down their ration and head up top again.

                     HIGGINS

           You reckon Captain will keep chasing him

           'round the Horn with every stitch of

           canvas flying?

                     DAVIES

           I reckon he'd chase him to the gates of

           hell if he has to.

                     PLAICE

           And that's where we're all going if he

           doesn't take in sail.

Since his injury, Joe Plaice's startlingly random

pronouncements have acquired the quality of an oracle.

153.   ON DECK

The wind rising from yell to shriek. Waves blown flat by it,

the ship travelling at a drunken sideways angle across a

raging expanse of white foam.

Four men on the wheel, lashed to it, with the air around them

full of water.

In the distance a tower of black rock on the rim of the sea,

distant rollers breaking against it and surging up to a

preposterous height.

JACK looks up at the great press of canvas as he paces the

quarterdeck, the officers glancing from the sails back to

JACK.

                     JACK

           Strike the topgallants.

Men gratefully rush to the ratlines and begin climbing to the

masts.

STEPHEN staggers up onto deck. JACK calls to him, pointing at

the black rock.

                    JACK (CONT'D)

          Cape Horn, Doctor!

STEPHEN stares across at the legendary Cape. He's struggling

with his pocket-glass when a lurch of the ship sends him

tumbling. As men help him below, WARLEY, the maintop captain

reports to the bosun.

                    HOLLAR (to WARLEY)

          Help them with that mizzen topgallant!

          You go too, Mr. Hollom!

HOLLOM looks desperate as he follows WARLEY up the ratlines

of the mizzen.

154.   MIZZEN TOPgallant MAST

WARLEY works frantically. He's out on the yardarm high above

the raging sea. He shouts for HOLLOM to join him, but HOLLOM

is still in the top, some twenty feet below, unable or

unwilling to climb any higher.

155.        THE SURPRISE - DAY

Wide to see the ship. WARLEY working on the swaying mizzen.

The bow swinging a couple of points further south.

156.        QUARTERDECK - DAY

Wood and rope straining as they wrestle to turn. Then a

tremendous crack as the mizzen-topmast splits and flies

backward into the sea, carrying WARLEY along with it.

                    BONDEN

          Man overboard!

Sail and cordage falling over the men at the wheel. A loose

block and tackle swinging murderously in the gale.

JACK fights free from the tangle of ropes as WARLEY vanishes

in the foam. The mizzenmast is acting as a sea-anchor

dragging the ship's head northwards toward the black rocks.

JACK grabs a speaking-trumpet as WARLEY briefly reappears.

                    JACK

          Swim for the wreckage, man!

Then to PULLINGS.

                    JACK (CONT'D)

          Reduce sail!

As crewmen scramble frantically into the rigging, JACK turns

back to see WARLEY desperately swimming toward the trailing

wreckage, his mates shouting encouragement over the howling

wind.

With sails reduced the ship perceptibly slows, but the

dragging wreckage is swinging the ship broadside on to the

waves.

                    BONDEN

          She's broaching!

PULLINGS runs to JACK, pointing to the trailing mass of ropes

and mast.

                    PULLINGS

          It's acting as a sea-anchor! We must cut

          it loose, Sir!

WARLEY still struggling to reach the wreckage but going under

with each wave. JACK, agonized, makes his decision.

                    JACK

          Axes!

AWKWARD DAVIES scrambles up the ladder with an axe, but loses

his footing and falls sprawling over the quarterdeck.

JACK grabs the axe and attacks the ropes. He's joined by

NAGEL who has run to assist before realizing that the man

overboard is his friend Warley.

                    JACK (CONT'D)

          Set to then. Set to!!

NAGEL's face is a mask of horror, but he obeys Jacks orders

and starts chopping. He and Jack work shoulder to shoulder,

matching blow for blow [   ]

The prow keeps turning, wave after wave coming at right

angles to the ship.

157.        ON THE GUN-DECK - DAY

A hatch cover is torn off by the force of water, a sudden

mighty deluge pouring down into the lower levels drenching

the men and swamping the guns.

                    HOLLAR (yells below)

          All hands to the pumps!

158.        QUARTERDECK - DAY

JACK and NAGEL [   ] keep hacking at the tangle of ropes.

Knocking chips off the railing in their urgency to cut free

the dragging mast.

Finally they succeed. The last of the ropes [ ] whips away,

the broken mizzen disappears aft and the ship swings

southward, away from the rocks.

The wreckage is swept away by the next wave, leaving WARLEY

struggling, his last chance of getting back to the ship gone.

Then another wave breaks over him and he is gone.

NAGEL is bereft. JACK lowers his head.

159.        OUTSIDE THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT

KILLICK and BLACK BILL.

                    KILLICK

          He's been at it again.

                    BLACK BILL

          Who's that then?

                       KILLICK

          The Jonah.

                    BLACK BILL

          What Jonah?

160.        THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT

JACK sits at his desk. The model of the Acheron that WARLEY

helped make sits accusingly in front of him.

STEPHEN pours him a glass on wine, and one for himself.

                     STEPHEN

          The deaths in actual battle are the

          easiest.

              (beat)

          For my own part - those who die under the

          knife or from some consequent infection:

          I have to remind myself that it is the

          enemy who killed them, and not me.

              (beat)

          Warley was a casualty of war, as surely

          as if a French ball had taken him.

JACK nods. Obviously the death still weighs on his

conscience. [ ]

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)

              (offering the wine)

          At the same time....

He breaks off

                    Jack

          At the same time, what?

Stephen hesitates, aware that he has to proceed carefully

                    STEPHEN

          You know that I wear two hats on every

          voyage. I am the captains particular

          friend and supporter, but also I am the

          ships doctor in which later capacity I am

          party to....

He catches a steely glint in Jacks eye and breaks off.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)

                    You don't want me to continue.

                    JACK

              (stiffly)

          On the contrary. I insist on it.

                    STEPHEN

          There is talk below decks of turning

          back. Or rather that we should have

          turned back some weeks ago. Of course the

          men would follow "Lucky Jack" anywhere,

          and usually in the confident expectation

          of victory. But that of course is the

          problem.

                    JACK

          What is the problem?

                    STEPHEN

          That you are not accustomed to defeat

          Jack. That you have taken it too

          personally. That chasing this larger,

          faster ship, with its long guns, is

          beginning to smack of pride 'which goeth

          before destruction'?

                    JACK

          It's not pride nor anything like it, it's

          a question of duty.

                    STEPHEN

          'Duty', ah yes. The naval signal for end

          of discussion.

                    JACK

          You can be as 'satiric' as you like,

          Stephen, but I have my orders. She is

          attacking our whalers. For why? Without

          whales we have no boot polish, nor any

          soap, nor oil for our lamps, not to oil

          our sabres and muskets. Destroying our

          whalers could win the war for Napoleon.

          Which is why we must catch this Acheron.

          As a man of learning surely you can see

          that.

                    STEPHEN

          At whatever the cost?

                     JACK

          Any whatever cost I choose to pay. And I

          will calculate that myself, Stephen

          without reference to your friends in the

          ward room.

160A MIZZEN-TOP

An icy wind whips at the men working on the temporary mizzen

mast.

Hollom, half way up the rigging is relaying instructions

between the men in the rigging and the men on deck

                      HOLLOM

          Cast off.

The new yard flails around on its pulley, bashing dangerously

against the mast. Almost claiming Nagel

                    HOLLOM (CONT'D)

          Belay. Sorry. Sorry.

161    QUARTERDECK

PULLING craning upwards. The topmen's shouted commands are

whipped away by the gale.

JACK joins him, still smarting from the conversation with

Stephen

                    JACK

          We'll have to go further south, get

          around this bloody west wind.

                    PULLINGS

          How far south?

                    JACK

          As far as is necessary, Mr. Pullings. The

          sixtieth parallel if need be.

162.        THE SHIP - DAY

Tacking southwards. The sun, a pale anaemic disc, gradually

disappearing behind layers of cloud.

The wind is a constant shrill whistle through the rigging, a

sound like some infernal drill which rises and falls but

never ceases.

                                                DISSOLVE TO -

163.        QUARTERDECK - DAWN

The sun rising in a clear sky which turns a sapphire blue.

White ice-islands lie all around them, some a pure, rosy

pink. Others bright ultramarine.

And still the wind howls, driving them further south.

MOWETT passes his telescope to STEPHEN MATURIN. As STEPHEN

studies some seals on an ice-beach, MOWETT launches into

verse, shouting against the wind -

                     MOWETT

          Then we upon the globes last verge shall

          go to view the ocean leaning on the sky

          from thence our rolling neighbours we

          shall know

          and on the hidden world securely pry!

He is interrupted by a bundle of guns clattering on board

from one of the small boats. They are followed by Mr Howard

clad in several thicknesses of sealskin and carrying a brace

of dead penguin.

164.   THE SHIP AT NIGHT

The ship scudding onwards, soundless at this distance, but

for the chilling high pitched whistle of the wind.

An iceberg passes in foreground, fantastic shapes of ice,

like a Gothic cathedral, sculpted by the elements.

165.         BERTH DECK - NIGHT

Hanging stoves provide some feeble warmth. Men huddle close

to them, their breath condensing, or lie shivering in their

bunks, unable to sleep for the cold.

HOLLAR appears with a lantern.

                     HOLLAR

           Rise and shine! Show a leg there, tumble

           up, tumble up - sleepers awake!

As the previous watch arrive downstairs, numb and dazed from

the cold, the next watch emerge from their hammocks and

dress. No-one speaks.

166.         THE GREAT CABIN - DAY

The officers take their places at dinner. Once again it's

penguin stew.

PULLINGS comes in, with an unexpected smile on his face and

whispers something to JACK.

                     JACK

           Praise be. At last.

The others seem to know what's going on, all except STEPHEN

who looks baffled.

                     STEPHEN

           Pray what is there to celebrate?

JACK holds up his hand for silence. A series of creaks and

groans from the ship. The coffee pot tilts on its gimbals.

                     JACK

           We have made our turn northward, Doctor.

           We are headed back toward the sun...

The officers give a slightly ragged cheer.

                    JACK (CONT'D)

          ...in anticipation of which. I asked

          Killick to prepare something special.

              (shouts off)

          Killick. Killick there.

KILLICK comes in with his usual exasperated expression,

bearing a tray with a silver tureen lid on it.

                    KILLICK

          Which I was just coming.

He lays it on the table.

                    JACK

          Gentlemen, I give you... our destination.

He whips off the lid to reveal a strange glutinous mass, a

pudding cut in the oddest of shapes. Everyone stands to get a

better look.

                    STEPHEN

          The Galapagos Islands.

                    PULLINGS

          'Pon my word so it is. Look: here's

          Narborough, Chatham and Hood...

                     JACK

          That's where the whalers are, ain't it Mr

          Allen. So that's where the Acheron will

          be headed.

The mood is now taken over by the glee of recognition, as the

officers marvel over the pudding.

                    JACK (CONT'D)

          Mr. Pullings, if you'll permit me, a

          slice of Albermale. For you Doctor,

          Redondo Rock.

There's a tiny man-of-war made of icing, between the islands.

JACK picks it up in his spoon.

                    JACK (CONT'D)

          And, with a fair wind behind us the

          Acheron for me.

167.        OPEN OCEAN, DOLDRUMS - DAY

Slow pan over a glassy expanse of water. JACK's head suddenly

breaks the surface, close to camera.

As he swims he brings the Surprise into view. The ship is

utterly becalmed, wallowing in the swell, her sails hanging

limp. A 'painted ship upon a painted ocean'.

JACK swims around the ship, which currently presents a less

than warlike picture with washing hanging from every part of

the rigging.

He calls up to PULLINGS -

                    JACK

          Best bowers chipped... Lot of rust on

          these forechains... black strake needs

          another coat.

168.   QUARTERDECK

JACK comes aboard, takes a towel from KILLICK and looks about

him.

The men are holystoning the deck and polishing the

brightwork. They look thin and exhausted and burnt dark-brown

by the sun and wind.

169.   FORECASTLE

Killick is with NAGEL and others tarring the ratlines as he

looks back at HOLLOM, patrolling the gangway.

KILLICK indicates him with a tilt of the head.

                    KILLICK

          That engagement off Recife: his whole gun

          crew killed and him not a mark on him.

          Soon as he went up the mizzen mast Warley

          falls. And whose watch was it when we

          lost our wind?

HOLLOM sees them looking at him.

170.        THE SCUTTLEBUTT, SHIP'S WAIST - DAY

A marine sentry, TROLLOPE, stands guard by the ship's water-

barrel - the level is very low. STEPHEN ladles some water

into a phial.

                     TROLLOPE

           One glass per man, sir, Captain's orders.

STEPHEN straightening, irritated by the challenge.

                     STEPHEN

           A mere thimbleful, Corporal, for

           scientific purposes only.

171.         STEPHEN'S CABIN - DAY

In the gloom of his cabin, STEPHEN angles the mirror of his

brass microscope toward the window, and places a slide

containing a droplet of water under the lens.

172.         MAINMAST-TOP - DAY

JACK climbs into the top. He adjusts his telescope, studies

the horizon.

173.   JACK'S TELESCOPE P.O.V.

He pans across the empty sea.

174.   STEPHEN'S MICROSCOPE P.O.V.

An assortment of mobile, transparent micro-organisms rotating

wildly.

                     STEPHEN (O.S.)

           My God, Padeen, a veritable zoo.

PADEEN takes a look, amazed then greatly amused.

175.         THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT

Charts are spread all over the table, STEPHEN poring over

them when Jack comes in

                     [   ]

                     STEPHEN

           Show me where these Doldrums lie?

JACK joins him.

                     JACK

           Stephen. Will we never make a sailor of

           you? The doldrums is a condition, not a

           region. But you tend to strike 'em

          here...

              (pointing)

          ...between the trades, and the

          sou'easterlies. I hope the Acheron is

          having it as bad as we are.

STEPHEN considers their current position on the chart, the

tiny Galapagos Islands to the north and the vast emptiness to

the west of them.

                    STEPHEN

          Assuming he is heading for the Galapagos,

          and not some other point in all this

          vastness?

                    JACK

          Come. I'd have thought you'd be delighted

          to go there. It is said to be a natural

          paradise

                    STEPHEN

          In truth I'd be delighted with the merest

          guano stained rock provided it didn't

          sway beneath my feet

                    JACK

          Well, we'll take on food and water once

          we're there, and as compensation for not

          having put ashore in Brazil I pledge that

          during that time, several days at least,

          you can wander at will, catching bugs and

          beetles to your heart's delight. You will

          be the first naturalist to set foot on

          the islands. That is my solemn promise

                    STEPHEN

          I accept, provided the men have not

          mutinied and thrown us all overboard

          before we get there.

                    JACK

          Mutiny? No. They are already counting

          their share of the prize money.

                    STEPHEN

          Another week of this and they shall

          gladly give it up for a glass of clean

          water.

                    JACK

          Ach, Stephen. Stephen. Pray stop your

          bellyacheing. We shall have rain

          presently, and if not we shall damned

          well tow ourselves out of this.

176.        JOLLY BOAT - DAY

Disgruntled, under-slept men, in boats towing the ship.

NAGEL and DAVIES look back darkly at HOLLOM who sits in the

stern.

                    HOLLOM

          Stroke. Stroke...

                    DAVIES (whispers)

          I heard he were on the Fair Marion as

          foundered off Tresco. And he were on the

          Zephyrus what exploded at Trafalgar.

HOLLOM has heard this, as DAVIES intended, but he looks away

choosing to ignore them.

177.        FIGHTING TOP - DAY

A view from above of men towing the ship. Over this an

unpleasant scraping sound - chalk on slate.

                    BONDEN

          M-a-s-t... mast

STEPHEN is writing words on a slate then offering them to

BONDEN whom he is teaching to read.

                    BONDEN (CONT'D)

          S-u-n... sun

STEPHEN nods and scratches another word on the board. As

BONDEN struggles to decipher it there's the sound of a musket

shot and a seabird falls out of the sky.

HOWARD, the captain of marines, reloads his smoking musket

laughing aloud.

                    STEPHEN

          Is that man completely mad?

              (shouts down)

          Mr. Howard, a petrel is not good eating!

HOWARD looks up towards them, a broad smile on his red moon

of a face.

                    HOWARD

          Were you never a man for sporting,

          Doctor? Why you could shoot all day in

          these waters with two men loading!

178.        GUN-DECK - DAY

The midshipmen and powder-monkeys have assembled for weapons

practise, armed with cutlasses. CALAMY and WILLIAMSON divide

the group into two teams, choosing sides as for school-yard

football.

                    CALAMY

          Blakeney...

                      WILLIAMSON

          Rye...

                      CALAMY

          Swift...

                      WILLIAMSON

          Boyle...

                    CALAMY

              (the final choice)

          All right, come on Addison.

Little ADDISON joins CALAMY's side, trailing his too-large

sword. WILLIAMSON tosses a coin.

                      CALAMY (CONT'D)

          Heads.

                    WILLIAMSON

          It's tails. We attack.

CALAMY's side retire to a defensive position made of tar

barrels at one end of the deck. From here they are suddenly

aware of Jack idly watching their mock-fight from the

quarter-deck

WILLIAMSON's team give a yell and charge at them.

It's serious fighting. Heads are struck, fingers are rapped.

BLAKENEY, trying gamely with his left arm but frustrated by

his own ineptitude, goes down under the rush of attackers.

                      BLAKENEY

          Ow ow ow!

                      WILLIAMSON

          Yield.

                    CALAMY

          Let go of him.

                    WILLIAMSON

          Yield!!

CALAMY can't drag the bigger boy off. He whips a pistol out

of his belt and fires it at WILLIAMSON's head.

WILLIAMSON is blasted sideways, clutching his face and

yelling in pain. The other boys separate, horrified.

                    CALAMY

          It's just powder. There wasn't a ball in

          it, just powder.

He helps BLAKENEY to his feet.

                    CALAMY (CONT'D)

          Are you all right?

                    BLAKENEY

          No.

Angrily shaking free of him, he looks to where Jack stood,

but the captain is no longer watching.

                    CALAMY

          What's wrong? I saved you.

                    BLAKENEY

          I didn't need to be saved.

179.        ON DECK - DAY

Tar bubbling under the heat of the sun. Cannons fizzing and

steaming as they are washed.

There's been a change of crews in the long-boats, and HOLLOM

and his men are now back on board. NAGEL is approaching from

one end of the narrow gang-way, HOLLOM from the other. NAGEL

pushes past, deliberately bumping HOLLOM, who stumbles,

clutching for the gunwale.

180.        QUARTERDECK - DAY

JACK sees this outrageous act of indiscipline and yells out -

                    JACK

          Master at arms! Take that man below and

          clap him in irons. Mr. Pullings,

          defaulters at six bells.

181.        THE GREAT CABIN, DOLDRUMS - DAY

JACK stands behind his desk, brow like thunder. From outside

the sounds of the muster. HOLLOM stands in front of him,

twisting his hat between his hands.

                    JACK

          The man pushed past you without making

          his obedience. And yet you said nothing.

                    HOLLOM

          No, Sir, I intended to but the right

          words just didn't...

                    JACK

          'The right words'? He failed to salute

          you. It's deliberate insubordination.

HOLLOM looks at the floor, mumbles -

                    HOLLOM

          They don't like me, Sir.

                    JACK

          They what? Speak up, man!

HOLLOM raises his head and looks at JACK, his eyes shiny with

tears and when he opens his mouth the words tumble out in a

rush.

                    HOLLOM

          I've tried to get to know the men a bit,

          Sir, be friendly like, but they've taken

          a set against me. Always whispering when

          I go past, giving me looks. But, I'll set

          that to rights, be tougher on them from

          now on.

                    JACK

          You can't make 'friends' with the

          foremast jacks, they'll despise you in

          the end. Nor do you need be a tyrant.

          It's leadership they want, strength,

          respect.

                    HOLLOM

          I'm very sorry, Sir.

                    JACK

          You're what twenty-three, twenty-four?

                    HOLLOM

              (smiling weakly)

          Twenty-five next Friday.

                    JACK

          You've failed to pass for lieutenant

          twice. You can't spend the rest of your

          life as a midshipman.

                    HOLLOM

          I'll try harder, Sir.

KILLICK helps JACK on with his full-dress uniform.

                    JACK

          Well, it's an unfortunate business,

          Hollom. Damned unfortunate.

KILLICK seems to endorse this by placing the captain's hat

emphatically on JACK's head.

Jack turns and strides out of the cabin, HOLLOM following

slowly after him.

182.        QUARTERDECK, DOLDRUMS - DAY

The entire crew has been mustered. The uniformed officers

line the quarterdeck as JACK reads from the Articles of War.

                    JACK

          'Article Thirty-Six. All other crimes not

          capital, committed by any person or

          persons in the fleet... shall be punished

          according to the laws, and customs, of

          the sea.'

              (then, to NAGEL)

          Mr. Nagel, you're an old man-of-war's man

          and yet you failed to salute an officer.

          You knew what you were doing. Have you

          anything to say in your defence?

NAGEL looks at the deck.

                     NAGEL

          No, Sir.

                     JACK

          Have his officers anything to say for

          him?

DAVIES and KILLICK scowl across the deck at HOLLOM, who looks

wretched but says nothing.

                    JACK (CONT'D)

          Seize him up.

NAGEL is spread-eagled to the grating, his hands tied.

                    HOLLAR

          Seized up, Sir.

                    JACK

          One dozen. Bosun's mate, do your duty.

The mate takes the leather cat-o-nine tails out of its red

bag.

                                                   FADE TO BLACK

                                                   FADE UP ON -

183.        THE GREAT CABIN - DUSK

JACK stands alone, tuning his fiddle. No matter how much he

turns the peg the top string always sounds flat. He tunes

some more and breaks it.

                    JACK

          Red hell...

184.        QUARTERDECK - DUSK

                    JACK (O.S.)

          ...and bloody death!

Every word is plainly audible to the men on watch, who

pretend to hear nothing.

185.        THE GREAT CABIN - DUSK

JACK is fitting a new string. Widen to reveal STEPHEN sitting

opposite with his cello.

                    STEPHEN

          I was merely remarking that you have

          always prided yourself on not being a

          flogging captain and this...

                    JACK

          I am not a "flogging captain". I have not

          once rigged the grating on this voyage,

          not once in twelve thousand miles.

          Besides, I wager you will find a deal

          more brutality on land.

Tightening the new string. The note escalating as he turns.

                    STEPHEN

          I'm not a party to it on land.

                    JACK

          Well you are party to it on my ship.

          Men must be governed. Often not wisely I

          grant you, but there are hierarchies even

          in nature, as you've often said yourself.

                    STEPHEN

          Hierarchies. That is the excuse of every

          tyrant in history. Of Nero. Of Boneparte.

                    JACK

              (trying to call a halt)

          Yes. Fine words I'm sure

                    STEPHEN

              (continues regardless)

          ...We are not animals and I for one am

          opposed to authority, that egg of misery

          and oppression..

                    JACK

          Very fine words Stephen, but In these

          current circumstances, hard-work and firm

          discipline is what keeps our little

          wooden world together.

                    STEPHEN

          And grog I suppose.

                            JACK

          Of course. What of it? Of course they

          have their grog!

                    STEPHEN (sits) (CONT'D)

          You know Nagel was drunk when he insulted

          Hollom. And Higgins is never sober. Even

          the midshipmen...

                    JACK

          The men will have their grog Stephen. It

          is part of the immemorial tradition of

          the service

                    STEPHEN

          Well a shameful tradition it is too. To

          have them pressed from their homes, kept

          in a permanent state of dull inebriation.

                       JACK

          Stephen...

                    STEPHEN

          ...confined for months in a wooden

          prison, Never more than a few hours sleep

          and flogged when drunken idleness drives

          them to....

                     JACK (forcefully)

          ...Stephen! I warn you that friend or no

          I will not have you talk of the service

          like that.

                    STEPHEN

          I am stating plain facts

                    JACK

              (finally explodes)

          Well I will not hear them! From you or

          anyone. You understand! Things are as

          they are for good or bad whether or not

          they have a place in your damned papist

          philosophy. If you are here to make music

          then sit down and play. If not be gone,

          for you have come

          to the wrong shop for anarchy!

In stony silence Stephen puts down his cello bow and leaves

past Killick, who is lurking as always by the door.

186.        SCUTTLEBUTT - DUSK

Something disturbs the dark surface of the water as HOLLOM

dips the ladle and fills his cup.

A sense of someone moving up behind him. HOLLOM turns

abruptly. It's the marine sentry, moving in the shadows. He

stares at HOLLOM as he backs away toward the ladder and

hurries below.

187.        BERTH DECK - DUSK

To reach his quarters he is obliged to walk the length of the

berth deck, past HOWARD obsessively cleaning his pistol,

another man whittling with a knife, DAVIES adding another

link in the tattooed chain about BECKETT's middle.

No-one speaks as HOLLOM runs the gauntlet of their stares,

acutely aware of his own breathing. It now seems universally

to be held that he is the author of all the ship's

misfortune.

Nagle pointedly turns his back, the scars from the flogging

gleaming wetly in the lamplight

Hollom's breath quickens. He stumbles on someone's dunnage,

almost trips but is caught before he falls. It's one of

NAGEL's mates.

                    NAGEL's MATE

          Careful, sir.

188.        MIDSHIPMAN'S BERTH - DUSK

HOLLOM comes in, wild-eyed and goes to his berth, breathing

hard. CALAMY, BLAKENEY & BOYLE look up from a tense game of

cards.

                    BLAKENEY

          Are you all right, Hollom?

HOLLOM shakes his head miserably, hyperventilating.

                    CALAMY

          He's not sick. He's useless. He's just

          dodging work.

                    BLAKENEY (angrily)

          Oh shut up Calamay. What do you know

          about anything?

CALAMY glares at BLAKENEY.

189.   INT STEPHEN'S ROOM - DUSK

A shot from the deck above.

STEPHEN looks up from his book "Di Consolazione Philosophae".

Then the sound of bare feet approaching, followed by a knock

at the door.

Its Joe Plaice, looking agitated.

                    PLAICE

          Beg your pardon, your honour, but Mr.

          Howard just shot a sea-monster!

190.        GANGWAY - DUSK

STEPHEN and PLAICE stride along to where the marine captain,

HOWARD, peers down into the water with one of his men.

                    HOWARD

          Doctor! The very man.

STEPHEN moves to the rail, looks out.

                    HOWARD (CONT'D)

          [   ] I wished you'd seen it for

          yourself, Doctor. The crew never seen

          anything like it.

On the glassy sea, a smudge of blood and some ripples

                    HOWARD (CONT'D)

          It was prodigious like a human, though

          bigger, might have been a sea-elephant,

          it had a calf with it - I didn't mean to

          hit the calf, I missed my mark.

                    STEPHEN

          Mr. Howard, let me beg you, if the men

          can't eat it or I can't dissect it,

          please do not shoot every creature you

          see.

STEPHEN stares back down at the ripples spreading over the

glassy sea.

191.        THE SURPRISE - NIGHT

Wide, on the troubled ship, small yellow patches of light

visible from the gun-ports.

192.        BELOW DECKS - NIGHT

The men are lying in their hammocks when, from somewhere

outside, there comes an ungodly howling. It stops, then comes

again, exactly human in its pitch.

The crew look at one another. This is like no sound they've

ever heard.

The howling stops then comes again, from another direction.

193.          THE GREAT CABIN, EXTERIOR - NIGHT

KILLICK and BLACK BILLY listening.

                    KILLICK

          What did I tell you? The ship's accursed.

194.          QUARTERDECK - NIGHT

JACK comes up from below.

                    JACK

          What is that abominable noise, for God's

          sake?

                    PULLINGS

          I have no idea, Sir.

                    MOWETT

          You don't think it's the Acheron, Sir?

                    JACK

              (untypically cutting)

          The enemy cannot come on us without a

          wind, Mr. Mowett.

He looks about at the terrified faces of the crew. The

wailing sound now rises to a shriek, as STEPHEN joins the

group.

                    JACK (CONT'D)

          What do you make of it, Doctor?

                    STEPHEN

          I'm sure I've never heard the like.

The crew overhear this and pass it among themselves as

another anguished howl fills the night.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)

          Perhaps it's the mother of the creature

          Mr. Howard shot.

                     JACK

          [    ] Creature?

                    STEPHEN

          [ ] A manatee. A sea-elephant possibly.

          Though I have never known one with a cry

          like this.

A glance along at HOWARD on the gangway, as terrified as

anyone.

                    JACK

          Bosun. Fire off some flares.

195.        WIDE ON THE SHIP - NIGHT

Three flares soar and burst with a ghostly glow, making a

pool of blue light around the ship, the sound continuing to

echo and re-echo from somewhere beyond.

196.        QUARTERDECK - NIGHT

The light illuminates the half-hour glass, its top-half empty

of sand. Like everyone else, the duty sergeant stands frozen

to the spot. Jack rounds on him.

                    JACK

          Sergeant, what the devil are you thinking

          of? Turn the glass and strike the bell.

Roused, the duty sergeant turns the glass and time resumes

its flow.

Two bells are hesitantly rung and the crew regain the power

of motion, their limbs still spastic with fear. And when the

sound comes once more they all freeze.

JACK joins MOWETT at the taffrail. The thing is somewhere out

there, whatever it is.

                    MOWETT

          Perhaps some poor shipwreck?

He shouts, a slight nervous catch to his voice.

                    MOWETT (CONT'D)

          Ahoy! Is anyone there?

Part of him knows it's crazy and of course there's no reply.

The sound constantly shifting position, now in the water, now

in the sky.

JACK turns to see a white face, frighteningly close to his

own. It's PADEEN, mouth agape, face unnaturally white,

staring into the gloom as though drawn to whatever horror

lies out there.

                    JACK

          Padeen. What are you doing on the

          quarterdeck?

He looks down at the press of men who have gathered at the

bottom of the ladder, some with weapons.

                    JACK (CONT'D)

          Below! All of you men below!

              (to MOWETT)

          Tell the bosun those off-duty may sleep

          with their lamps on.

197.        LOWER DECK - NIGHT

Several crewmen huddle close together their faces lit by a

battle-lantern. Joe Plaice grim. Doudle wide-eyed. Higgins

with his alcoholic tremor more pronounced than ever.

                    BLACK BILL

          Duppies make that noise.

                    KILLICK (indicating BILL)

          See. They know all about this in Africa.

                    DOUDLE

          What's a duppie?

                    BLACK BILL

          That Warley. Swallow by a fish. Spirit

          can't get out. Him duppie now.

                    SLADE

          Captain don't even know what that noise

          be.

General nods of agreement.

                    DOUDLE

          Doctor neither, and he knows everything.

                    KILLICK

          Joe here's got the most experience in

          these matters, and new brains to boot,

          let's hear it from Joe.

All eyes on JOE PLAICE. He speaks from the shadows.

                    PLAICE

          It's the Jonah causing it. That howling

          thing is a signal to the Phantom-Ship.

          He's calling it up, don't you see? Every

          time he's on watch the ship appears. You

          wait and see, the ghost-ship will appear

          any time tonight, and take us all

          straight to the hot-place.

Another shriek, closer now, seems to confirm JOE's bizarre

theory.

198.        MIDSHIPMEN'S BERTH - NIGHT

The boys sit together. None of them look at HOLLOM, who sits

pale and wretched in a corner of the room, clutching his

stomach.

199.        STEPHEN'S CABIN - NIGHT

As the howling continues, STEPHEN looks through a number of

books on sea-creatures searching for a reference to what

they're experiencing.

As JACK looks over his shoulder, his eye is caught by a

picture in one of STEPHEN's books.

He picks it up.

Close on the picture - it's an engraving of a giant squid,

its tentacles wrapped around a ship.

Back on JACK holding the picture up to STEPHEN.

                    JACK

          You don't think...?

There is a knock on the cabin door and BLAKENEY enters,

agitated.

                    BLAKENEY (to STEPHEN)

          It's Mr. Hollom, sir, you better come

          quick.

200.   MIDSHIPMEN'S BERTH

HOLLOM writhing in agony on the floor, STEPHEN trying to calm

him, shouting for assistance from the midshipmen and then

from PADEEN.

                    STEPHEN

          Mr Hollom. Sir. Try to contain yourself.

          Hold his head. Mr Hollom. Padeen

201.        STEPHEN'S CABIN - NIGHT.

Stephen is writing some case notes in his journal, when Jack

puts his head around the door.

Stephens POV: The lamp, lighting his face from below and to

one side, gives a strange lopsided twist to Jacks smile

                    JACK

          Well?

                    STEPHEN

          There's nothing physically wrong with

          him. He thinks he's been cursed by the

          0men.

                    JACK

          Then he probably has been. Sailors will

          abide a great deal, but never a Jonah.

          It's like a white crow - the others peck

          it to death.

                    STEPHEN

          A 'Jonah'? My God, you believe it too.

                    JACK

          I desired to save you the trouble of

          looking for a cure. No doubt it will all

          be sorted by the morning.

202      FORECASTLE, LATER - NIGHT

BLAKENEY stands near the bows peering out into the night. A

figure approaches from behind and lays a hand in his

shoulder.

BLAKENEY nearly jumps out of his skin.

                    BLAKENEY

          Mr. Hollom! You gave me such a start. Are

          you better now?

HOLLOM's breathing does indeed seem easier.

                    HOLLOM

          Much better, thank you.

                    BLAKENEY

          I think the creature is going away.

                    HOLLOM

          I am sure of it.

He reaches down, picks up a 12 pound cannonball.

                    HOLLOM (CONT'D)

          You've always been very kind to me.

          Goodbye, Blakeney.

With a sudden movement he's on the gunwale, then he jumps

over the side the cannonball in his arms.

BLAKENEY looks down with shock to see HOLLOM's pale face

receding from him into the depths. It's a moment before he

gathers his wits to shout -

                    BLAKENEY

          Man overboard!

203.        QUARTERDECK - DAWN

The ship's company are mustered on deck. JACK stands at the

sword rack lectern. KILLICK hands him a Bible open at the

story of Jonah.

JACK looks, then hands it back to KILLICK.

                    JACK

          The fact is, [   ] not all of us become

          the men we once hoped we might be. But we

          are all God's creatures. If some of us

          thought ill of Mr. Hollom, or spoke ill

          of him, or failed him in respect of

          fellowship, then we ask your forgiveness,

          Lord, and we ask for his.

Close on the faces of the crew - KILLICK, HIGGINS, NAGEL,

CALAMY, BLAKENEY and finally Stephen who is staring oddly at

Jack, as though holding him partly responsible for this

latest tragedy.

                    JACK (CONT'D)

          Amen.

                    CREW (mumble ashamedly)

          Amen.

The men on deck remain standing, heads bowed, observing a

minute's silence, as the sky begins to pale, and the white

disc of the sun appears above them.

FASTER DOUDLE is the first to look up, followed by others -

the terrible sound has gone and a small puff of wind is

stirring the mainsail.

204. HOUR GLASS

The sand runs out of the half-hour glass.

                    BONDEN

          Strike eight bells.

                    QUARTERMASTER (to the marine sentry)

          Turn the glass and strike the bell.

The glass is inverted. The bell tolls.

205.        SURPRISE AT SEA - DAY

The ship moves through a tropical squall. Men rig a sail to

catch the water, others appear with barrels and tubs,

anything to catch the precious rain.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO -

206.        THE SURPRISE - DAY

Sea birds swarming over a shoal of fish in the foreground as

the cry of the distant lookout carries faintly across the

sea.

                     LOOKOUT (O.S.)

          Land-ho!

207.        GANGWAY - DAY

BLAKENEY runs along the gangway, past STEPHEN, en route to

the quarterdeck.

                     BLAKENEY

          Give you joy, sir! We have raised the

          Galapagos!

208.     MONTAGE oF TELESCOPE VIEWS, GALAPAGOS - DAY

There's a primeval quality to the landscape, a feeling of a

world just born. The wild creatures that inhabit the lava

flows and coral beaches confirm this - the giant tortoises,

iguanas, sea-lions and penguins, a teeming profusion of

exotic animals and plants.

209.        QUARTERDECK/FORECASTLE/TOPS - DAY

The ship fairly bristles with telescopes.

210.   FORECASTLE

A small group of familiar faces share a pocket telescope.

                    HIGGINS (looking)

          Can't see any wimmun. Just lots of ducks

          and lizards.

DOUDLE takes the telescope.

                    DOUDLE

          Wot? There must be wimmun. T'ain't

          natural.

211.   QUARTERDECK

STEPHEN and BLAKENEY side by side. From both their faces we

sense their wonder at seeing these remarkable creatures for

the first time.

                    STEPHEN

          How extraordinary.

                       BLAKENEY

          What, sir?

                    STEPHEN

          Those birds!

He's looking at a group of unremarkable black seabirds

waddling about on a rock, flapping short, stumpy wings.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)

          A species of cormorant. But apparently

          flightless, by all that's Holy. I believe

          that is unknown to science.

BLAKENEY dwells briefly on the strange rock-climbing birds

then drifts back to the iguanas.

                    BLAKENEY

          The dragons don't seem to bother 'em.

                    STEPHEN

          They are a type of iguana I should think,

          and therefore vegetarian.

His telescope remains focussed on the cormorants. BLAKENEY is

wholly absorbed in the iguanas.

                    BLAKENEY

          Will you catch one?

                    STEPHEN

          Yes. Most certainly. And if we can, some

          eggs.

                    BLAKENEY

          I mean the great lizards.

                    STEPHEN

          Oh!

Recognizing how superficially dull the birds are to

BLAKENEY's untutored eye, by contrast with giant lizards.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)

          I should think a pair of them. Then you

          can present one of their offspring to the

          king.

                    BONDEN

          Ha! There's one going for a swim.

                    STEPHEN

          No. Iguanas are land animals.

                    BONDEN

          Not these ones.

The prehistoric-looking creatures, as if suddenly awakened,

begin diving into the water.

                    STEPHEN (O.S.)

          By Jove Bonden you are right! Two new

          species in as many minutes.

He breaks off, suddenly aware of a shouted exchange between

the lookout and the quarterdeck.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)

          What is all that confounded bellowing?

                    JACK

          All hands about ship!

BLAKENEY dashes off and STEPHEN is elbowed out of the way by

hands rushing to get at the sails.

                    NEHEMIAH SLADE

          By your leave sir, by your leave.

                    HOLLAR (distant)

          Helms a'lee - off tacks and sheets -

          mainsail haul!

As the ship turns a distant whaleboat appears with six men

aboard, pulling out from one of the neighboring islands.

212.        IN THE LEE OF THE SHIP'S HULL (TIME-LAPSE) - DAY

The whaleboat has come alongside.

Men swarm down the boarding nets and the whalers are helped

aboard, hoarse and exhausted from rowing and shouting.

                    HOGG

          God bless you. Thank you, shipmates.

213.        QUARTERDECK - LATER, DAY

HOGG, the senior whaler, sits with his mates, relating his

story to JACK and the officers.

                    HOGG

          We was coming back for fresh lines, hid

          in that inlet, yonder. Black-three

          master. Bit beamy and raised in the

          stern.

Meaningful looks among Jack and his men. Its definitely the

Acheron he's describing [   ]

Hogg meanwhile takes a pint mug of water, gulps it down, and

passes it back to BLAKENEY for a refill.

                    HOGG (CONT'D)

          Hundred thousand pound of good whale oil

          they stole. Then the bastards...

                    ALLEN

              (cuffs him)

          No swearing on the quarterdeck.

                    JACK

              (waves ALLEN away)

          Go on.

                     HOGG

           ...Then they burnt our bloody ship and

           headed off, bunch of fugging pirates.

Looking pointedly at Allen

                     [      ]

                     JACK

           And her course?

                     HOGG

           Maybe a point south of west. Following

           the rest of the whaling fleet.

                     JACK (rising)

           Mr. Mowett, these men to be entered on

           the ship's books. Mr. Allen, lay a course

           west sou'west.

As ALLEN hurries away shouting orders -

                     PULLINGS

           Should we not take on fresh supplies,

           Sir? Those tortoises...

                     JACK (overlapping, impatient)

           There's not a moment to lose, Mr.

           Pullings.

He leaves the quarterdeck and goes below, STEPHEN following.

214.   IN THE GREAT CABIN

JACK has taken his jacket off and is already unfurling his

charts. STEPHEN hurries in.

                     STEPHEN

           Have you forgotten your promise?

                     JACK

               (not looking up)

           Subject to the requirements of the

           service, Stephen. I could not in all

           conscience delay for the sake of an

           iguano or a... giant peccary -

           interesting no doubt, but of no immediate

           application.

                     STEPHEN (overlap)

          How can you dismiss, out of hand, the

          bounty of nature? Knowledge that... that

          will help to progress...

                    JACK (overlap)

          I can see nothing on shore that will

          progress our mission.

                    STEPHEN (overlap)

          But how can we possibly know what lies

          [ ] on these islands, perhaps some

          knowledge that may save life, that...

                    JACK (overlap)

          I will tell you how to save lives

          Stephen. Inform me how to guide this

          ship, undetected, under the nose of a 40

          gun frigate. That is the job in hand sir.

STEPHEN swallows his indignation and tries for a compromise.

                    STEPHEN

          Well perhaps there's an opportunity to

          serve both our objectives. As I

          understand it you mean to go round the

          end of this long island, then start your

          voyage. I could walk across it, be on the

          other side long before...

JACK shakes his head.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)

          I would walk briskly, pausing only for

          important measurements and almost

          certainly making valuable discoveries...

                    JACK (interrupts)

          If wind and tide had been against us I

          should have said yes. They are not and I

          am obliged to say no.

              (with finality)

          No.

STEPHEN is livid. Betrayed.

                    STEPHEN

          I see. So after all this time in your

          service I must simply be content to form

          part of this belligerent expedition,

          hurry past inestimable wonders, bent

          solely on destruction...

                    JACK

          ...you forget yourself, sir.

                    STEPHEN

          No Jack, You have forgotten your self.

          You once believed in the rights of each

          individual man no matter how useless or

          lowly. But it seems to me now that the

          long exercise of power has brought you to

          the point where even a solemn promise...

                    JACK

          The promise was conditional.

                    STEPHEN

          ...a promise to a friend of ten years

          standing who has stood by you and

          supported you....

                    JACK (overlapping)

          I command a King's ship, not a private

          yacht...

                    STEPHEN

          ...across half the worlds oceans often at

          risk to his own life

                    JACK

          ...and we have no time for your damned

          hobbies, sir!

"Hobbies". So that is JACK's honest view of STEPHEN's

lifetime of work in science. He bows slightly, then leaves.

215         QUARTERDECK - DUSK

STEPHEN stands alone at the taffrail watching as the islands

recede in the distance.

News of the violent argument has spread and there is many a

sympathetic glance, which further humiliates STEPHEN.

BLAKENEY approaches him carrying something carefully in the

palm of his hand.

                    BLAKENEY

          Sir, I found a curious beetle walking on

          the deck.

He opens his hand - close, on a very plain little brown

beetle.

                      BLAKENEY (CONT'D)

            I think it's a Galapagos Beetle, sir.

                      STEPHEN

            I'm sure of it.

                      BLAKENEY

            Were you to have walked all day on the

            island, you might never have come across

            it.

                      STEPHEN

            That is more than likely, sure.

BLAKENEY passes it to STEPHEN.

                      BLAKENEY

            You can have it.

                      STEPHEN

            Thank you, Mr. Blakeney.

BLAKENEY hovers for a moment, unsure of further conversation,

then retreats.

216       IN THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT

JACK sits alone at the table. KILLICK enters with toasted

cheese for two.

                      KILLICK

            No music? That's a shame

He sets down the toasted cheese.

                      KILLICK (CONT'D)

            I'll just leave the one plate then, if

            himself won't be joining.

                      JACK

            Yes, Killick. Just the one.

JACK cuts himself a portion, scowling at STEPHEN's cello

which seems to watch him reproachfully as he eats.

217.      STEPHEN'S CABIN - NIGHT

STEPHEN takes a dropper, carefully measures twenty drops of

laudanum to a glass of water, and drinks.

218.        LOOKOUT - DAY

The lookout leaning out from the cross-trees.

                    DOUDLE (shouting)

          On deck there. Object fine on the

          starboard bow.

219.        THE SHIP LYING STATIONARY - DAY

A barrel is being lifted aboard from the skiff and passed up

the side of the ship.

220.   IN THE WAIST OF THE SHIP

JACK comes down, accompanied by ALLEN, the acknowledged

expert in these matters.

Others gather round, including HOGG the whaler, inspecting

the stencilled markings.

                    ALLEN

          Martha's vineyard.

                    HOGG

          No, this here's from Boston. I was

          married there once.

                    ALLEN

          Any road, it's a Yankee barrel.

                    HOGG

          What they call a Bedford Hog in New

          England.

                    MOWETT (to JACK)

          The Acheron touched at Boston.

                    HOGG

          And it's not been in the water more than

          a week.

                    ALLEN

          One can't say with any accuracy but...

                    HOGG

          Yes you can. There's no sea chummer on

          it, and the dowels is sound.

221.        ON THE QUARTERDECK - DAY

JACK returns to his post.

                    JACK

          Continue due west, Mr. Bonden.

TOM PULLINGS watches him. There has been a change amongst the

officers and crew toward JACK. His relentless driving after

the Acheron has reached the point of obsession, an obsession

not shared by his exhausted men.

He is a lonely, haunted figure as he now steps up on the

gunwale, one hand on the ratlines, scanning the empty sea,

sensing his enemy is out there, just beyond the curve of the

earth.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO -

222.        LADDER (TIME LAPSE) - DAY

A wild wind humming through the rigging as STEPHEN goes

topside.

223.        FORECASTLE - DAY

He finds various hands making the boats secure.

                    PLAICE

          Have you seen the bird, doctor?

                    STEPHEN

          I have not - no bird these many days.

          What kind of a bird?

                    PLAICE

          A sort of albatross I believe, or perhaps

          a prodigious great mew. He has been

          following the ship since... there he is,

          crossing our wake!

224.        ON THE GANGWAY - DAY

STEPHEN runs along the gangway to get a clearer view,

checking himself when he sees JACK on the quarterdeck.

Their eyes meet. The quarterdeck is JACK's domain now, and

STEPHEN avoids it.

Then, behind JACK, the great bird suddenly appears.

It's huge, with at least a fourteen foot wing-span, and

flying very close to the ship, drifting and soaring on the

gusting wind, appearing and disappearing between the sails.

STEPHEN is mesmerized by it. He lets go of the rail, leaning

forward to get a better view.

At the same time across from STEPHEN on the opposite gangway,

HOWARD and two or three marines open fire on the bird. The

bird drops low, flying right by STEPHEN.

Again a crackle of gunfire, but the bird is apparently

uninjured, and it banks away, skimming the surface of the

water.

STEPHEN sags to the deck. A shout. People running. Blood

spreading across the white of his shirt. HOWARD there by his

side.

                    HOWARD

          My God, man! I'm so sorry. The bird

          dropped low. I didn't see you there!

JACK is there, shouting -

                    JACK

          Calamy! Get Higgins!

              (then turning to BONDEN)

          Padeen, Davies, carry the Doctor below.

STEPHEN gets slowly up, hands reaching to help him, HOWARD in

the background distraught, explaining to anyone who'll listen

what happened.

                    STEPHEN

          It's all right, I am quite capable of

          walking.

He tries to stand, crumples.

225.        STEPHEN's CABIN - DAY

HIGGINS presses clumsily around the wound as STEPHEN lies on

the bed, his abdomen rigid, his breathing laboured. JACK

watches from the door.

                    STEPHEN

          You will just make it worse... by

          prodding, Mr. Higgins, it cannot be got

          at... except by opening me up.

A violent pitching of the ship makes it obvious how

impossible this will be under sail.

As STEPHEN lapses into unconsciousness, HIGGINS looking

alarmed, approaches JACK.

                     HIGGINS (a whisper)

           The bullet took a piece of shirt in with

           it. Unless it is removed it will

           suppurate and fester.

                     JACK

           Are you equal to the task?

                     HIGGINS

           I'll need to read up on the Doctor's

           books, like. Study some pictures he has,

           get my bearings. Be better on land, but

           I'll manage somehow.

JACK looks away from the alcoholic HIGGINS back to STEPHEN.

226.   OUTSIDE THE CABIN

JACK passes an anxious crowd of the ship's company: BLAKENEY,

JOE PLAICE, KILLICK and HOWARD.

                     JACK

           You men get about your business.

There are dark looks in JACK's direction as he retreats to

his cabin.

227.   THE GREAT CABIN - DAY

JACK throws a chart on the table.

With his protractor he marches out great strides west into

the Pacific from the Galapagos Islands and marks the ship's

position - they are maybe a hundred miles from the Galapagos,

ahead, open sea until the Marquesas.

228.       INT. STEPHEN'S CABIN - DUSK

Lying on his bed, in some pain, STEPHEN hears thudding feet,

shouted orders.

In his weakened state, the sounds tend to merge. His

pitching cabin keeps swimming out of focus.

There's a knock on the door and JEMMY DUCKS appears with a

mug of soup and some biscuit.

                    JEMMY DUCKS

          ...sail on the horizon, sir. Hull down,

          running west. It may be a couple of days

          before we can catch her.

STEPHEN nods, all he wants is quiet.

JEMMY DUCKS retreats, as STEPHEN swigs from a little bottle

of laudanum, which for a moment brings peace, effectively

blocking out the noise from above.

A smile to PADEEN, like a farewell, and he closes his eyes.

229.        FORECASTLE - DUSK

JACK, telescope to his eye, studies the distant ship as

PULLINGS jumps down from the ratlines to the deck.

                     PULLINGS

          It might be the Acheron. If we put on

          more sail we'd come up with her before

          nightfall.

JACK lowers the telescope, turns his back on PULLINGS,

strangely abstracted.

                     PULLINGS (CONT'D)

               (to his back)

          Do you wish me to set the topgallants?

               (no reply)

          Sir?

A long silence. Then JACK walks away.

PULLINGS stares perplexed from JACK's retreating figure to

the distant chase.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO -

230.        INTERIOR STEPHEN'S CABIN - DAWN

Early morning light on the interior of the cabin. PADEEN is

asleep, holding a Bible, in the doctor's chair.

STEPHEN himself lies motionless with his eyes closed and his

mouth open, no colour in his face.

The sea is relatively calm. From outside the sound of the

bosun's orders, over rattling blocks and pulleys.

                    HOLLAR (O.S.)

          ...Clap on now! Every rope an end...

          Jolly-boat away... Slowly, Jenks! You

          grass-combing lubber!

MOWETT comes in, sees STEPHEN, and takes him for dead.

                    MOWETT

              (shouts outside)

          Davies! Slade!

Two big men come in behind him. PADEEN wakes, confused and

pushes them away, moving protectively to the doctor's side.

The commotion disturbs STEPHEN. His eyes open. Like a dead

man just come back to life.

                    MOWETT (CONT'D)

          Doctor. You're still with us. Can we move

          you onto a stretcher?

STEPHEN swallows uncomfortably and tries to make sense of

things.

231.        A GALAPAGOS ISLAND - DAY

A giant iguana watches as a small procession trudges up the

stony beach.

At its head, STEPHEN is carried in a litter up to where a

tent has been set up above the high-water mark.

His P.O.V. as JACK appears in the blue sky above him.

                    STEPHEN

          Tell me this wasn't on my account?

                     JACK

              (dead pan)

          No. It was because of Higgins.

              (beat)

          Can't have him poking around in your

          belly without a solid platform to work

          on.

He ducks as they enter -

232.        THE HOSPITAL TENT - DAY

In the creamy light, they lay STEPHEN down on a recently-

constructed wooden operating table.

HIGGINS squats on the ground, rummaging through various large

sharp surgical instruments which he has emptied onto a piece

of Hessian.

                    JACK

          All set, Higgins?

STEPHEN grabs JACK's sleeve.

                    STEPHEN

          Not Higgins. I do this with my own hand.

Jack frowns, unsure what he means by this.

EXT. THE TENT - NIGHT

PADEEN stands, arms crossed at the closed tent-flap, keeping

at bay a crowd of well-wishers, and the merely curious.

INT. THE TENT - NIGHT

STEPHEN sits pale and sweaty, propped up on a series of

chests, his back against a coil of rope. In front of him,

suspended by pulleys, LAMB and NAGEL have set up a large

gilt-framed mirror.

Beside him, on a white tablecloth, some small scissors and

scalpels.

                    STEPHEN

              (To Jack)

          [ ] You are sure you have a head and a

          stomach for this kind of thing?

                    JACK (smiles)

          My dear Doctor, I have seen blood and

          wounds since I was a little boy.

                    STEPHEN

          Then hold my belly, pressing firmly when

          I give the word.

STEPHEN begins first with the knife, then the probe - the

grind of metal on living bone.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)

          You will have to raise the rib, Higgins.

          Take a good grip with the square

          retractor. Up. Harder, harder.

              (to himself)

          Snip the cartilage.

The metallic clash of instruments, perpetual swabbing.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)

          Now, Jack, a steady downward pressure.

          Good. Keep it so. Give me the davier.

          Swab, Higgins. Press, Jack, press.

JACK closes his eyes. STEPHEN draws in his breath, arches his

back, and it's done.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)

          There she is.

He pulls out the bullet, and with it, a fragment of his

shirt.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)

          Is that all of it?

The bloody piece of shirt is handed to HIGGINS who matches it

to the hole in STEPHEN's old shirt.

                    HIGGINS

          Aye, she'll patch up nicely, sir.

                    STEPHEN

          Easy away, Jack. Handsomely with the

          retractor. Higgins, look to the Captain,

          while I swab.

HIGGINS helps JACK into a chair, pressing his head down

between his knees. After a moment, and a few deep breaths,

JACK looks up. STEPHEN smiles at him. A hint of surly

triumph.

                                                   FADE TO BLACK

                                                   FADE UP ON -

235.        STEPHEN'S TENT - DAY

Through a gap in the door of his tent STEPHEN can see the

distant ship at anchor. Repairs are underway, guns being

unloaded, stores and fresh water being ferried aboard.

BLAKENEY comes in, followed by PADEEN with a some numbered

boxes hung round his neck.

                    STEPHEN

          My goodness, what is this?

BLAKENEY starts rolling up the sides of the tent as PADEEN

unloads his boxes, each with a beetle and a piece of

vegetation in it.

                    BLAKENEY

          Well sir, Padeen and I have been doing

          some collecting for you. The beetles each

          come with a specimen of plant they were

          found on. Ooops. Catch him, Padeen! There

          he goes.

He finishes rolling up the tent sides to reveal a collection

of cages, with native wildfowl in them, being fed by the

poulterer, JEMMY DUCKS.

                    BLAKENEY (CONT'D)

          The birds were snared by Jemmy Ducks.

          Captain says we can keep them in the

          chicken coop.

Then, producing a notebook -

                    BLAKENEY (CONT'D)

          And I made a few notes if you want to see

          them.

STEPHEN flips the pages:

No 22. Large square black beetle with pincers. Found under

rock. Eats earthworms.

                    STEPHEN

          'Pon my word you have the makings of a

          true naturalist.

BLAKENEY is flattered but unsure.

                    BLAKENEY

          Well sir, perhaps I could combine them,

          and be a kind of Fighting-Naturalist,

          like yourself?

                                    [   ]

Stephen smiles at this description as he levers himself into

a sitting position.

                    STEPHEN

          Shall we take a tour of your aviary?

BLAKENEY looks doubtfully at the doctor's bandaged abdomen.

                    BLAKENEY

          Should you really be up?

                    STEPHEN

          Yes. Padeen!

PADEEN puts the escaped beetle in his mouth for safe keeping

and offers STEPHEN a hand. STEPHEN pulls himself painfully to

his feet and starts buttoning his shirt.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)

              (To Blakeney)

          How long does the Captain intend that we

          stay here, do you know?

ON THE BEACH - DAY

JACK is watching those of the crew not on duty play cricket

on the shore, with a canvas ball and stumps made of

driftwood.

                    JACK

          Oh, a week perhaps. There is no great

          hurry.

                     STEPHEN

          But surely, we must make haste for the

          Marquesas?

                    JACK

          It may not have been the Acheron that we

          sighted. Nor can we be sure of her

          destination.

              (looks away)

          No, I think we shall go home now, before

          peace breaks out with France, God forbid.

He's making light of what has been a huge and far-reaching

decision.

                    STEPHEN

          But how will it sit with the Admiralty?

          To have spent six months in a fruitless

          pursuit and then come home empty-handed?

                    JACK

          "Empty-handed"? Not a bit of it. What

          about these plants and animals which

          Blakeney has been collecting? The British

          museum will need an entire new wing for

          'em.

STEPHEN regards him gravely, shaking his head.

                    STEPHEN

          I fear, Jack, you have burdened me with a

          debt I can never repay.

He is absolutely sincere about this, to JACK's great

embarrassment.

                    JACK

          Tosh. Name a shrub after me. Something

          prickly and hard to eradicate.

                    STEPHEN

          A shrub? I shall name a giant tortoise:

          Testudo Aubreii!

237.        SURPRISE CAMP - DAWN

STEPHEN, BLAKENEY and PADEEN leave the camp on STEPHEN's

first day of exploration. They are armed with nets, baskets

and a day's supply of food and water.

STEPHEN walks slightly stooped, leaning on a walking stick.

238.        COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

A strange and wonderful landscape lies before them, with its

organically-shaped lava flows and alien-looking flora and

fauna.

Everywhere STEPHEN looks there are creatures unique to the

islands. He is in his element, collecting specimens which

PADEEN carefully stores in the baskets.

BLAKENEY has his telescope trained on some distant humps.

                    BLAKENEY

          Doctor, would you think it very

          unscientific of me to ride on the back of

          one of those tortoises.

                    STEPHEN

          No, Mr. Blakeney. I would think it an

          experiment of absolutely vital

          importance. But afterwards, I do desire

          to find that flightless cormorant,

          assuming that is what it is, and that I

          still have strength enough to catch it.

239.        A VALLEY - DAY

BLAKENEY gets astride a giant tortoise and burns his bottom

on its scorching hot shell.

240.        LAVA BEDS - DAY

STEPHEN with his telescope taking notes on bird-life.

241.        LOW SCRUB - DAY

The huge, strangely balletic figure of PADEEN chasing after a

butterfly in evening light.

242.        A HEADLAND - DAY

Wide to see another aspect of the countryside - a hint of

distant sea, a rocky headland rising from the plain.

The group is widely scattered. STEPHEN at the base of the

headland, BLAKENEY half a mile further inland. PADEEN coming

up slowly behind, laden with the fruits of their expedition.

243.        BASE OF THE HEADLAND - DAY

STEPHEN rests a moment. Some stones rattle down from the

hillside. He looks up to see a flash of black feathers near

the crest - the cormorant.

On his shirt a red smudge has appeared. His wound has begun

to bleed again.

Ignoring this, Stephen pushes on after his quarry.

244.   THE ROCKY SLOPE

Near the top, STEPHEN pauses to catch his breath and glances

above him.

Again the bird, moving higher, as if leading him on.

STEPHEN gets down on all fours, crawling cautiously to the

crest just above him.

245.   TOP OF THE HEADLAND

A clearing. There is movement in the bushes.

STEPHEN slowly rises, climbs the few paces to the hilltop and

enters a clearing.

He searches amongst the bushes. Nothing.

He turns and looks back down the hillside to see BLAKENEY and

PADEEN far below, then sits to get his breath back again.

STEPHEN'S P.O.V: on the ground between his feet, a beetle. He

picks it up.

Close, on his hand. It is the same type of beetle BLAKENEY

gave him aboard the Surprise.

Smiling at the coincidence STEPHEN raises the tiny creature

to eye level.

His P.O.V.: the beetle, the creature in sharp focus, behind

it the sea, and on the sea, a black shape.

The focus shifts to the background - a ship at anchor in a

bay.

The beetle flies away as STEPHEN stares out at the ship. It's

the Acheron, and they are weighing anchor.

246.         COUNTRYSIDE - DUSK

BLAKENEY urging STEPHEN to hurry as they make their way

through the darkening landscape. All kinds of creatures are

appearing around them, and every few yards STEPHEN pauses to

examine something.

                     BLAKENEY

           Sir, you must hurry!

                     STEPHEN

           A moment! You're a worse tyrant than any

           ship's captain.

He's breathing hard, exhausted.

                     BLAKENEY

           You must carry him, Padeen!

PADEEN looks at the collection of baskets he carries.

                    BLAKENEY (CONT'D)

          Leave them! We must get back to the ship.

STEPHEN raises his hand in protest, but BLAKENEY is already

divesting PADEEN of his load.

247.        COUNTRYSIDE - LAST LIGHT

PADEEN carrying STEPHEN 'piggy-back', BLAKENEY out ahead

urging them on.

247a   THE DISCARDED COLLECTING BOXES

A variety of small bugs and animals crawling free

248      STEPHEN'S CABIN - NIGHT

STEPHEN gingerly lowers himself into his 'elbow-chair',

gripping the table and BLAKENEY's good arm for support.

Sighing, he begins emptying his pockets of various small

items collected during the day - some leaves, rocks and

insects - and places them in ordered piles around his

microscope.

All about them can be heard the urgent sounds of departure -

the anchor rattling up, shouted orders and the drumming of

bare feet on the deck above.

He holds up a stick in a specimen-jar, and is examining it

with his magnifying glass when JACK enters.

                    JACK

          I forgot to ask you - did you see your

          bird?

STEPHEN's eye grossly enlarged through the lens.

                    STEPHEN

          I did not. My greatest discovery was your

          phantom.

                    JACK

          Indeed it was, I'm sorry...

                    STEPHEN

              (waving the magnifying glass)

          Not a bit of it. William and I made a

          unique discovery.

Handing JACK the jar and magnifying glass.

                     STEPHEN (CONT'D)

           Tell him, Mr. Blakeney.

                     BLAKENEY (beaming)

           It's a rare phasmid, Sir.

JACK inspects the stick. It winks at him.

                        JACK

           A phasmid?

                     BLAKENEY

           It's an insect disguised as a stick.

JACK stares at the creature.

                     BLAKENEY (CONT'D)

           In order to confuse a predator.

JACK looks up at STEPHEN.

249.   BAY, GALAPAGOS - NIGHT

The Surprise alive with crewmen on the deck and in the

rigging. Shouts and commands drift across the water as she

turns and heads out from the bay.

249a         GANGWAY - SAME TIME

JACK strides along the quarterdeck towards the forecastle

issuing a stream of orders -

                     JACK

           Mr. Hollar, rouse up all the yellow paint

           we have. I want six men with brushes

           slung over the side.

               (moving on)

           Doudle!

                        DOUDLE

           Yessir.

JACK hands him a piece of paper with a sketch on it.

                     JACK

           Get your sail makers working on this.

           Sixty yards by five yards with an eyelet

           every seven feet.

                        DOUDLE

            Aye, Sir.

He shouts to HOGG who, with a few men, is manhandling a large

metal cauldron from the ballast to the gun-deck.

                      JACK

                (to HOGG)

            Have Nagel patch it up and light a fire

            in it.

                (shouts)

            Mr. Calamy!

                         CALAMY

            Aye, Sir.

                      JACK

            Once we're underway, replace some of the

            sails with the oldest, most patched set

            we have.

                      CALAMY

            They'll be in the afterhold, Sir. I'll

            need some men to move all the clutter.

                      JACK

            Good. Spread it around the foredeck. The

            more mess the better.

249B.    SIDE OF THE SHIP,. NIGHT

The ship powers ahead as men swing in harnesses above the

racing water, painting out the Nelson chequer.

249C.    ON DECK.   NIGHT

NAGEL positions the great cauldron amidships as men come up

from below with old barrels and bits of rope.

                         CALAMY

            Haul away!

On the gangway, Men under CALAMY's instructions haul on

ropes, pulling up the old patched sails.

The sails lead us up to

250.    CROSSTREES - NIGHT

JACK, PULLINGS and the whaler HOGG scan the dark horizon.

                         HOGG

          There, Sir. A mainmast toplight.

JACK has to use a telescope.

                    JACK

          You've got good eyes, Hogg.

Shouts down to the helm -

                    JACK (CONT'D)

          Mr. Bonden, set a course west-south-west.

              (to PULLINGS)

          We'll drop below the horizon and come up

          on the other side of him, let him think

          he's seen us first.

251.        SURPRISE - DAWN

First light reveals the results of an overnight

transformation - from a naval warship to a shambolic-looking

Portuguese whaler.

The gunwales are painted an untidy ochre and the gun-ports

hidden behind broad strips of canvas.

The sails are patched and ragged, the forecastle cluttered

with barrels. Smoke billows from a cauldron amidships.

On deck and in the rigging, there's a quarter of the normal

complement of men, all of them dressed in purser's slops.

252.        QUARTERDECK - DAWN

A bemused STEPHEN looks about him as he approaches JACK.

                    STEPHEN

          I see. A wolf in sheep in sheep's

          clothing

                    JACK

          A phasmid, doctor. It was you what gave

          me the idea.

                    STEPHEN

          I'm not sure a phasmid can be a predator.

                    JACK

          No? Well this one is.

253.        BERTH DECK - DAWN

HOWARD and his marines change out of their smart uniforms,

into the oldest most ragged clothes on board the ship, much

to the amusement of the passing sailors.

                    CREW MEN AD LIB

          Very fancy. Blue to match your eyes. Is

          there a skirt comes with it?

254.        GUN-DECK - DAWN

Men are checking the breechings of the great guns and

chipping cannonballs to make them more perfectly spherical,

more deadly.

The armourer is at his grindstone sending out showers of

sparks, a group of seamen round him relaying one another at

the crank, stacking newly honed cutlasses and boarding axes

at their feet.

Another team check and load pistols by the score.

254.        MIDSHIPMEN'S QUARTERS - DAWN

Alone, BLAKENEY awkwardly draws his dirk, left-handed from

its scabbard. It glints momentarily in the lamp-light.

CALAMY enters, face aglow, abruptly trying to cover his joy

when he sees BLAKENEY.

                    BLAKENEY [ ]

          It's all right. Permission to boast.

          You're to lead the boarders from the

          forecastle. Congratulations.

                          CALAMY

          Thank you.

                    BLAKENEY

          You'll make lieutenant out of this.

The others come in.

                    BOYLE

          He already has. 'Acting' 3rd Lieutenant

          Peter Calamy.

Oohs and aahs from all.

                          BLAKENEY

              [       ]

          Then I'll see you at the forecastle,

          'Lieutenant'.

                    CALAMY

          That's not your station.

BLAKENEY looks from CALAMY to the others, who avoid his eye.

                    BLAKENEY

          But naturally I'll board with you?

                    CALAMY

          I'm sorry, Will. Captain's orders.

BLAKENEY is devastated.

Rye bursts in, in a state of high excitement.

                    RYE

          She's seen us!

256.        QUARTERDECK - DAWN

JACK raises his glass, focuses on the Acheron, plainly

visible in the distance, with a line of signal flags running

up her backstay.

                     MOWETT

          She's asking us to heave to. Shall I give

          the order?

                    JACK

          No, make a show of fleeing upwind, but

          panicky and disorganized, like a whaler

          might do.

Allen smiles at this unintended slight

                    JACK (CONT'D)

          No offence, Mr. Hogg.

257.        WIDE ON THE SHIPS - DAY

A show of chaos on deck as the Surprise veers upwind, away

from the Acheron. As she presents her stern we see her new

name: Malacca.

258.        QUARTERDECK OF THE SURPRISE - DAY

Through his telescope, JACK looks back at the Acheron in

pursuit, a dark figure on her foredeck.

                    JACK

              (to Mowett)

          Run up Portuguese colours.

              (then down to the gun-deck)

          Load, Mr. Pullings. Triple shot 'em.

BLAKENEY comes onto the quarterdeck and salutes, looking

flushed and angry.

                    BLAKENEY

          May I speak with you, Sir.

                    JACK

          No saluting, Mr. Blakeney, we're whalers

          here.

                    BLAKENEY

          Mr. Calamy says I am not in the boarding

          party, I wanted to say -

                    JACK

              (interrupts)

          I know what you want to say and my answer

          is no. I promised your mother I would

          return you in one piece and I have

          already failed her on that score. You

          will command a gun and then retire to

          defend the quarterdeck here with Dr.

          Maturin.

                      BLAKENEY

          But sir -

                    JACK (cutting in)

          Go to your station, Mr. Blakeney.

BLAKENEY begins to salute, doesn't, and retires, tears

burning his eyes.

A moment later there's a flash of orange astern as the

Acheron opens up with her bow-chasers. An 18 pound shot

screams past the side of the Surprise to land with a column

of spray just off their bows.

                    JACK (CONT'D)

          Good shooting. Remind me to press her bow

          gunner, Mr. Pullings.

The second ball takes down some rigging.

                     JACK (CONT'D)

          Start the water and throw some barrels

          overboard.

He goes below.

259.   WAIST - DAY

Barrels go overboard and pumps spout streams of water over

the side as JACK runs down to

260.   THE GUN-DECK

The great majority of men are gathered here, more than a

hundred of them crammed together with their muskets and

sabres, listening to the odd thump from topsides as another

ball from the Acheron hits home.

CALAMY and his gang of young tykes are squashed in there

somewhere, BOYLE, WILLIAMS, ADDISON and the rest, eyes

shining with nervousness and wild anticipation, as JACK

addresses his men, who shout encouragement, ad lib, in every

pause.

                    JACK

              (plus the men ad lib)

          We're a long way from home. (Right you

          are, Captain!) A long way from anywhere,

          (Too true!) But if Britain rules the

          waves she rules these waves too. (Right

          she does!) And the blow we shall deal for

          his Majesty here will be felt just as

          keenly (I'll say it will) aye - and

          cheered just as loudly ('specially by the

          wimmin!) - as any dealt at Trafalgar or

          Cape St. Vincent.

The camera moves over the upturned faces, PLAICE, NAGEL,

DOUDLE, KILLICK, the midshipmen, the powder-monkeys, the

whole fellowship of the ship. And finally STEPHEN watching

JACK doing what he does best: transmitting his own

fearlessness into other men - the total warrior, the

consummate leader.

                    JACK (CONT'D)

          I don't say it will be easy. She's twice

          the men we have and they'll sell their

          lives dearly. But every man here is worth

          three of Boney's privateers, and I know

          there's not a faint heart among you.

CALAMY pipes up -

                    CALAMY

          Three cheers for the Captain.

                    MEN (deafening)

          Huzzah huzzah huzzah!

On CALAMY, cheering like a kid at a football match as...

261.          QUARTERDECK - DAY

Another well-placed shot from the Acheron smashes through the

rigging, sending down a shower of rope and cordage.

JACK is back at his station by the wheel, the Acheron little

more than a half a mile astern, the figure of the captain in

his black coat clearly visible.

JACK studies the looming black vessel, then turns and crosses

to BONDEN at the helm. BONDEN nods, lifting his hands from

the wheel as JACK grips the curved timber decisively, taking

the strain.

He feels the pulse of the ship through his fingers, looks up

to the sails then back to the Acheron. STEPHEN appears beside

him, casually smoking a cigar. He offers one to Jack, who

declines

                     [   ]

Another shot pierces the mizzen foresail above them, but

neither man flinches. KILLICK appears with two cups of

coffee, and in his belt a brace of pistols.

                    KILLICK

          I took the liberty, Doctor.

                     STEPHEN

          [    ] Thank you, Killick.

JACK steers one-handed as he sips his coffee.

                    JACK

          Mr. Mowett? [  ] A poem might be in

          order.

Another shot through the sails.

                     MOWETT

           A poem, Sir?

                             [   ]

               (after a moment's reflection)

           'Oh were it mine with sacred Maro's art,

           To wake to sympathy the feeling heart,

A ball goes howling past the ship, MOWETT winces.

                     MOWETT (CONT'D)

           Then might I, with unrivalled strains,

           deplore,

           Th'impervious horrors of a leeward

           shore.'

JACK smiles, nods.

                     MOWETT (CONT'D)

           'Transfixed with terror at th'approaching

           doom...'

                        JACK

           What!

                     MOWETT

               (apologetic)

           ...they were only people of the merchant

           service, of-course, Sir.

262.   P.O.V. ACHERON

She's now less than five hundred yards from their stern, and

gaining.

263.    QUARTERDECK

JACK turns back to MOWETT.

                     JACK

           We have her Mr. Mowett. Strike the

           Portuguese colours and run up the Jack...

           Mr. Pullings. Canvas off the gun-ports,

           and run 'em out. Mr. Howard? Marines away

           aloft.

The British Jack rises to the masthead replacing the

Portuguese colours, as PULLINGS descends to the gun-deck.

264. SHIP'S SIDE -

The black muzzles appear with a low rumbling sound, as

265.   QUARTERDECK

JACK, with a wink to MOWETT, yells at the top of his voice

                       JACK

             Helm's a lee!

....and spins the wheel hard to starboard.

266.   THE SURPRISE

Wide, to see her swinging broadside on, across the path of

the oncoming Acheron.

267.   POV ACHERON DAY

Confused shouts from the enemy's deck, chaos on her

forecastle, somewhere a drum beating.

268 + 269.    DELETED

270.   THE SURPRISE QUARTERDECK - DAY

JACK hands the wheel to BONDEN.

                       JACK

             Run us down her larboard side then cut

             across her wake!

                 (shouts down to the gun deck)

             Hold fire Mr Pullings! Hold till we're

             broadside on!

271. - THE SURPRISE AND THE ACHERON

Wide, to see the Surprise turning downwind, back towards the

Acheron, so they will pass broadside to broadside [   ] no

more than thirty yards apart.

272. QUARTERDECK/ GUN-DECK, SURPRISE

Through a furious exchange of musket fire JACK runs down the

ladder to the gun-deck-

                       JACK

             Fire as she bears! Every gun to

             concentrate on her mainmast!

Through the gunports the Acheron's great hull becomes

visible. Some of the Acheron's guns have run out, but the

crews are unprepared and disorganized.

                      PULLINGS

            On the uproll! Fire for the mainmast as

            you sight her!

As the Surprise rolls and the upper deck of the Acheron

becomes visible.

273. THE SURPRISE GUNS

Barking, leaping back one by one, great tongues of flame

spitting from their barrels, dense clouds of smoke rising.

274.    VIEW OF THE ACHERON

With an almighty splitting sound their mainmast falls,

dragging yards and rigging with it, the whole mass falling

over their side, obscuring many of their gun-ports.

275. GUNDECK/QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE -

Cheers from the crew. Jack yelling up the companionway

                      JACK

            Now Mr Bonden! Hard a'starboard!

276.    THE SURPRISE AND THE ACHERON

The Acheron wallows, bought to a standstill by the enormous

dragging weight of their mainmast.

BONDEN wheels the ship across the enemy's wake, past the

exposed, vulnerable stern.

277.    DELETED

277A.   GUNDECK, SURPRISE

                      JACK

            Fire at will!

278.    GUN-DECK, SURPRISE

In random sequence the Surprise's gunners pound it into the

Acheron's stern. Casement windows vanish in a cloud of wood

and glass, exposing the Acheron's terrified gun-crews, now

open to devastating fire as the Surprise glides past.

279.    QUARTERDECK

JACK climbs up on the gunwales, shouting to BONDEN -

                      JACK

            Lay me alongside!

280.    THE SURPRISE AND THE ACHERON

The bow of the Surprise lurches into the Acheron mid-ships,

spars interlocking, the Surprise guns firing into her at

point-blank range.

The crew throw grappling hooks.

281..   QUARTERDECK

                      JACK

            Boarders away!

And he leaps to the enemy deck, a great tide of men following

after him.

282.    FORECASTLE

CALAMY leads his own children's crusade from the bows and

forecastle: youthful but terrifying, screaming and swinging

their blades.

283.    QUARTERDECK

An agonized BLAKENEY watches from where he stands beside

STEPHEN. JOE PLAICE is close by with some of the older men,

ready to ferry the wounded below.

284.    ON THE ACHERON

As the Surprises pour onto the quarterdeck they face

withering fire from the enemy. A dozen men go down, some of

them fatally wounded. Among them are DOUDLE, BOYLE, ALLEN and

HORNER in quick succession.

The attack momentarily falters, and the Acherons surge back

at them.

JACK rallies his men and they charge again - the marine,

TROLLOPE, and NAGEL are blown backwards by grapeshot.

LAMB, enraged, surges past NAGEL's body, swinging his axe to

devastating effect, with HOLLAR by his side and JEMMY DUCKS

protecting their rear, a pistol in each hand, firing from the

hip.

JACK keeps pushing onwards, the centre of the milling,

swirling, hacking crowd, stabbing and pistolling each other

with barely room to fall.

The Acherons are gradually forced back across their

quarterdeck and down into the waist of the ship.

285.   WAIST OF THE ACHERON

JACK crosses swords with a man in front of him, as an enemy

pikeman drives his blade into his left arm, tearing through

the sleeve. BONDEN fires a pistol by his ear, deafening JACK

and killing the pikeman.

To either side, privateers are trying to reach them,

shouting, swearing in English, French and Spanish.

Bullets and missiles rain down from above, killing friend and

foe alike.

KILLICK is in the thick of it, a pistol in either hand, and

from his lips a high-pitched blood-curdling scream.

AWKWARD DAVIES is foaming at the mouth as he swings a meat-

cleaver right and left.

286.   QUARTERDECK, ACHERON

A commander of the privateers notes the poorly defended

Surprise, and leads a counter-attack over onto her

quarterdeck.

                     CALAMY

           Look to our quarter-deck!

287. QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE

BLAKENEY, dirk in hand, turns to face them, as does HOWARD

and his men, but they are gravely outnumbered.

288.   FORECASTLE, ACHERON

CALAMY sees the danger and leads his gang back onto the

Surprise, calling for others to follow.

                     Calamy

           This way! Follow me!

289. QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE

STEPHEN, PADEEN and JOE PLAICE appear from below. STEPHEN

picks up a pistol and with deadly accuracy shoots a privateer

lunging at CAPTAIN HOWARD. The man drops, a neat hole in his

forehead. A moment's astonishment from HOWARD at the Doctor's

surprising skill.

CALAMY fights his way to BLAKENEY who is down on his knees

stabbing at the legs of the attackers.

290.   WAIST, ACHERON

JACK, BONDEN and DAVIES are driving a wedge toward the stern,

the defenders falling back in disarray.

291.   QUARTERDECK OF THE ACHERON

PULLINGS and MOWETT fight side-by-side.

A swivel-gun mounted on the taff-rail is swung to face them.

The gunner is about to fire when a perfectly-aimed musket

ball hits him, again fired by STEPHEN.

292.   QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE/ACHERON

CALAMY, BLAKENEY and their group force the counter-attack

back onto the deck of the Acheron. The two boys fight as a

team as they move toward the stern.

292.   SIDE OF THE ACHERON

Some Acherons jump overboard to escape the furious attack.

Others are thrown, grasping at woodwork as they fall.

293.   QUARTERDECK OF THE ACHERON

JEMMY DUCKS turns the swivel on a group of Acherons, the

grapeshot blasting them up against the gunwale.

294.   IN THE WATER

Oil burns. Men drown, others struggle to stay afloat,

clinging to the mass of wreckage floating by the hull.

295.   WAIST OF THE SHIP

Cheering from the Surprises, demands to surrender in many

languages, some beg for mercy, others fight on.

296.   BELOW DECKS

JACK moves alone, down to the berth deck. He smashes the

chain off a locked-door, releasing a dozen or more prisoners.

Everywhere signs of the lethal blast through the ship's

stern, bodies, guns upended, shattered timbers.

He makes his way through to the Great Cabin.

297.   GREAT CABIN, ACHERON

Four privateers look up as JACK bursts in.

They have been looting their own ship's valuables, two of

them are too drunk to be scared.

                      JACK

           Where is your captain? Ou est votre

           capitaine?

One man leaps out through the shattered windows. A couple of

others raise their hands and start jabbering in French and

Spanish.

298.   QUARTERDECK, ACHERON

It's all over for the Acherons as a French officer hauls down

their colours.

A cheer from the Surprises - a few last shots fired. CALAMY

and BLAKENEY cheering, BLAKENEY holding aloft the captured

flag.

A dying Frenchman suddenly lunges at CALAMY with a sabre.

BLAKENEY steps in front of him and takes the blow.

299.   IN THE SICK-BERTH, ACHERON

A doctor is working here, a callow-faced man in a bloody

apron, red-eyed from fatigue.

JACK enters, a fearsome sight, with his singed yellow hair

and blood-stained cutlass.

                     JACK

           Le Capitaine? Where is he?

The doctor points at a body on the operating table.

JACK approaches, looks down at the dead man. He's [ ]

somewhere about JACK's age, fine-featured, with his black

coat draped over his body.

                     DOCTOR

           Il mavait prie de vous donner ceci.

Passing JACK the captain's sword.

300.   QUARTERDECK, ACHERON

JACK picks his way through the dead and wounded to where

CALAMY sits nursing BLAKENEY.

                     CALAMY

           He's dead, sir.

Gently, JACK picks up the lifeless body and walks slowly back

down the quarterdeck, the boy draped across his arms.

Friend and foe part silently in front of him as he crosses

the gangway to...

301.   QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE

...then with CALAMY following, he goes below.

302.   THE GREAT CABIN - DAY

JACK in wide shot, sitting alone on the bench running under

the stern windows. His hunched posture and red tear-stained

eyes give a glimpse of his familiar post-battle mood - a mix

of grief and depression, the old question, "Was it worth the

price?".

                                                 FADE TO BLACK

                                                 FADE UP ON -

303.         ACHERON AND SURPRISE - DAWN

The two ships anchored close together on the ocean.

304.         QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE - DAWN

As eight bells are rung for the change of watch we see a row

of canvas hammocks each containing the body of a fallen

crewman.

DAVIES and PLAICE stitch the bodies into their hammocks,

BLAKENEY the last body in the line. As the men approach -

                     CALAMY

           I'll do it.

JOE passes him the needle and twine, then they leave him

alone.

As CALAMY sews up the hammock, HOLLAR's voice is heard

distinctly from below.

                    HOLLAR (O.S.)

          Rise and shine, show a leg there. Tumble

          up! Tumble up!

In close-up: the peaceful face of BLAKENEY

                    HOLLAR (O.S.) (CONT'D)

          Sleepers awake!

...as CALAMY's hands stitch the canvas closed.

305.        WIDE ON THE SURPRISE - DAWN

The small figures of the crew assembled on the quarterdeck.

JACK's voice drifting across the water.

                    JACK

          John Henry ALLEN...

          Joseph NAGEL...

          William Horner...

          Stephen Winston Boyle...

          and Lieutenant William Blakeney

          We therefore commit their bodies to the

          deep, looking for the resurrection of the

          body, when the sea shall give up her

          dead...

          Amen.

                    ALL

          Amen.

The bodies in their weighted hammocks slide into the sea.

306.        BOW OF THE SURPRISE - DAY

Wide on STEPHEN and BLAKENEY as they sit watching two

dolphins surfing the bow-wave, STEPHEN pointing out various

features of these magnificent creatures, doing his best to

take the boy's mind off the loss of his friend.

307.   THE SURPRISE AND THE ACHERON - DAY

The two ships sail abreast - the Acheron, her shattered masts

jury-rigged.

308.   QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE - DAY

JACK stands with LIEUTENANT MOWETT and the signals

midshipman, WILLIAMSON. They look across at the Acheron.

                    JACK

          Signal... 'Parole prisoners

          Valparaiso'...

                    WILLIAMSON

          You mean Lieutenant Pullings, Sir?

                    JACK

          No. Captain Pullings.

WILLIAMSON hurries to the signals locker, the signal book and

JACK's message in his hand.

309.   TELESCOPE POV   DAY

The line of colored signal-flags run up to the mast-head of

the Surprise.

309A   QUARTERDECK ACHERON

Midshipman Rye is reading the signal for Pullings

                    RYE

          ....then 'Rendezvous Portsmouth. God-

          speed, Captain Pullings.'

A contented smile on Pullings face as his promotion is

confirmed. He waves across to JACK as the Acheron makes a

sharp turn away from the Surprise.

310.   DELETED

311.   ABOUT THE SHIP - DUSK

Slowly the crew come back to life as old familiar habits and

routines reassert themselves.

 Acting First Lieutenant MOWETT walks the quarterdeck

composing a poem in memory of the battle.

 JOE PLAICE tells a story of witchcraft and haunted ships to

a small attentive audience.

 While AWKWARD DAVIES works further on the tattoo about

BECKETT's waist. The chain begun off BRAZIL now winds its way

around most of his torso.

 BLAKENEY and JEMMY DUCKS are feeding the assorted creatures

collected at the Galapagos, as...

 BONDEN reads his first book, 'Diseases of Seamen' by

Stephen Maturin, his brow furrowed, his lips moving silently.

 While the powder-monkeys skylark in the rigging

313.   INTERIOR, GREAT CABIN - NIGHT

STEPHEN plays a note on his cello [      ]

                    STEPHEN

          Shall we begin?

JACK pauses, gazing into space.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)

          Jack, brother, you're gathering wool.

                    JACK (smiles)

          Thinking about their captain. A great

          seaman, whatever you may say of him. The

          doctor said he was killed by our first

          broadside. I'd have liked to talk to him,

          face to face.

                    STEPHEN

          Maybe you did.

                      JACK

          What?

                    STEPHEN

          While I was tending the prisoners they

          told me their doctor died of fever, two

          weeks ago. There was no doctor on that

          ship when we boarded it. And I doubt you

          will find one there now.

JACK goes very still. A silence broken only by the sound of

water flowing gently past the hull.

He looks down at the captain's sword on the table, the

thought of a possible final deception flooding through him.

                      STEPHEN (CONT'D)

          Shall we?

He starts to play, the deep booming sound of the cello

carrying through to ....

312.   OUTSIDE THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT

KILLICK, wearing an ostentatious bandage about his head, is

preparing toasted cheese with BLACK BILL.

                     KILLICK

           That's the last of the cheese and like as

           not they'll leave it seizing to their

           plates with their tweedly tweedly

           tweedly.

                     JACK (O.S.)

           Killick? KILLICK THERE!

                     KILLICK (projecting)

           Which it will be ready when it's ready!

In the cabin, the violin joins with the cello. Rolling,

undeniable music, the music of the waves, resonating through

the great ship and filling the night. Stephens mind is far

away. Jack breaks off abruptly:

                      JACK

          You're still missing your cormorant...

          flightless eh...well then. It will still

          be there when we come back

And he breaks into a merry jig

313.   SURPRISE, EXTERIOR - NIGHT

Wide, to see the stern of the ship and a patch of surrounding

water lit by the great stern lantern. Through the casement

windows the two men can be seen playing.

Wider, to the vast dark sky and the heaving ocean all around,

with the stern cabin, a tiny orange light, still faintly

visible in the darkness.

314.   FURTHER BACK

And further still. Until we see the curve of the earth, and

the planet spinning on its journey through space.
