                   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE

                   As the ANGLE WIDENS, we see the crew at stations;

                   (screens and visual displays are in use): COMMANDER

                   SULU at the helm, COMMANDER UHURA at the Comm Con-

                   sole, DR. BONES McCOY and SPOCK at his post. The

                   Captain is new -- and unexpected. LT. SAAVIK is young

                   and beautiful. She is half Vulcan and half Romulan.

                   In appearance she is Vulcan with pointed ears, but her

                   skin is fair and she has none of the expressionless

                   facial immobility of a Vulcan.

                   Another hit: reverberating flashes of spark and flame

                   on the bridge. Spock dies. Bones comes to him, but

                   even as he coughs his way through the smoke, a final

                   hit and Bones falls. The room is smoke filled and a

                   shambles. Saavik looks about in shock.

                             I'm not a drama critic.

                   Bones rolls his eyes and rises. Kirk sees Saavik who

                   has not moved.

                             to stay with the sinking ship?

                                           SAAVIK

                             Permission to speak candidly, sir?

                             Very well.

                             I don't believe this was a fair

                             test of my command capabilities.

                             Because... there was no way to win.

                             every commander may face. Has that

                             never occurred to you?

                                           SAAVIK

                             ... No, sir. It has not.

                             as important as how we deal with

                             life, wouldn't you say?

                             As I indicated, Admiral, that

                             thought had not occurred to me.

                             Then you have something new to think

                             about. Carry on.

                             microbe or the show's off.

                                     (she thinks)

                             Why don't you have a look? If it

                             IS something that can be moved...

                                           TERRELL

                                     (eager)

                             You bet, doctor. We're on our way!

                   Carol sighs as the image fades, not happy.

              10   INT. CORRIDOR, SPACE STATION REGULA I                       10

                   Carol walks through the labyrinthine complex with

                   DAVID, her son, a bright young scientist of twenty.

                   He is good looking and humorous.

                                           DAVID

                             How can you let them pull that

                             stuff on you? They're just lazy.

                                           CAROL

                             And bored. I know. But maybe it

                             IS something they can...

                                           DAVID

                             Come on, Mother, that's just the

                             military mentality. Never put off

                             tomorrow what you can put off today.

                             If there's one atom of life...

                                           CAROL

                             I know, I know...

                   Silence.

                                           DAVID

                             Well, don't have kittens.

                             Genesis is going to work. They'll

                             remember  you in a wreath with

                                           CAROL

                                     (mock outrage)

                             Thanks a lot. No respect from my

                             offspring --

                                           DAVID

                             Par for the course... you teaming

                             up with me for bridge after dinner?

                                           CAROL

                             Maybe...

                                           DAVID

                             Every time we have dealings with

                             Starfleet, I get nervous.

                                     (shrugs)

                             We're dealing with something

                             that COULD be perverted into

                             a dreadful weapon. Remember that

                             overgrown boy scout you used to

                             hang out with? That's exactly

                             the --

                             Listen, kiddo, Jim Kirk was many

                             things, but he was never a Boy

                             Scout...

                   HOLD ON the empty corridor.

              11   INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT, TERRA - NIGHT                        11

                   Kirk reads the novel, trying to focus. His flat befits

                   an Admiral and a loner with few possessions, except

                   a collection of antiques.

                   WE HEAR A SOFT BONG.

                   Startled, Kirk lowers the book and pushes a button.

                                           KIRK

                             Come.

                   The door slides open and Bones enters. He carries two

                   packages, one of them wrapped in brown paper.

                                           KIRK

                                     (continuing)

                             Bless me, doctor; and what beams

                             you into this neck of the woods?

                                           BONES

                             'Beware Romulans bearing gifts.'

                             Happy Birthday...

                   With a flourish, he pulls out a bottle of blue

                   liquid.

                                           KIRK

                             Romulan Ale! Bones, you know

                             this stuff is illegal --

                             I only use it for medicinal

                             purposes. Don't be a pring...

                                     (reading the label

                             Twenty-two, eighty-three...

                                           BONES

                             ferment. Gimme.

                   He takes the bottle and pours; continues talking.

                                           BONES

                                     (continuing)

                             Now open the other one.

                   Kirk starts to obey.

                             I'm almost afraid to. What did

                   They drink. The package is opened: a pair of gold

                   "Ben Franklin" half-glasses. (N.B.: Romulan Ale is

                   an INSTANT DRUNK: both men react.)

                             For your eyes. For most patients

                             of your age, I generally administer

                             Retlax Five to restore flexibility

                             of the lens.

                             But I'm allergic to Retlax.

                                           BONES

                             Exactly. Happy birthday.

                   He toasts. Kirk is unsure how they work.

                                           BONES

                             Slide them down your nose. Now look

                             at me over the top. And you read

                   An awkward silence.

                             Bones, I don't want to be lectured.

                             From yourself, Admiral.

                   Pause. Kirk pours another drink.

                   With the TRICORDER to guide them, they set out...

                   back! It is the face of a CHILD! The Apparition

                   scares the daylights out of Chekov -- and us. He

                   screams.

                                           TERRELL

                                     (continuing)

                             What is it?

                   He comes clumsily over --

                                           CHEKOV

                             A face! I saw -- it was like a

                             child --

                   He points. The porthole is empty.

                                           TERRELL

                             You're crazy -- !

                                           CHEKOV

                             I saw it -- !

                                           TERRELL

                             There's an air-lock.

                   He points and they go into the airlock.

              19   INT. CARGO HOLD                                             19

                   Terrell and Chekov enter, dumbfounded. THEIR POV.

                   Someone lives here -- there are beds, food, all jury-

                   rigged -- but no people. Terrell checks a monitor.

                                           TERRELL

                             There's breathable atmosphere in here.

                   He takes off his helmet; Chekov likewise.

                                           TERRELL

                                     (continuing)

                             What the hell is this? Did they

                             crash? Where's the rest of the

                             ship?

                   They wander as they talk, picking up objects that be-

                   speak a fairly sophisticated ad hoc environment: a

                   laboratory in one hold; a kitchen; A LARGE SAND TANK

                   filled with disgusting CETI EELS.

                   ABRUPTLY A SOUND -- They start: CHILD'S GURGLE.

                                           CHEKOV

                                     (terrified)

                             I told you! I told you I saw a --

                                           TERRELL

                             Ssssh!

                   They start looking. They enter a new chamber --

              20   KHAN'S QUARTERS                                             20

                   On its side in the sand: the walls are now the floor,

                   etc. All in crookedness -- like its owner. On the

                   floor, smiling at them (i.e., the wall) is a BABY.

                   Tentatively they come over to it, looking around --

              21   ANGLE - CHEKOV'S POV                                        21

                   Lethal-looking odd swords on one wall, a bookshelf;

                   CAMERA PANS by 20th Century volumes; MOBY DICK, KING

                   LEAR, THE HOLY BIBLE -- and a seat belt dangling with

                   the name on it -- 

Botany Bay

.

                   Chekov mouths the words, softly at first, then aloud --

                                           CHEKOV

Botany Bay

 -- oh no!

                                           TERRELL

                                     (examines the child)

                             What's the matter -- ?

                   Chekov runs, tries to get his helmet on, tries to drag

                   Terrell --

                                           CHEKOV

                             Captain, we've got to get out of

                             here -- 

now

! Damn! Hurry!

                   Terrell catches his urgency --

                                           TERRELL

                             But the child --

                                           CHEKOV

                             Never mind! Hurry!

                   Terrell and Chekov emerge, helmeted, then stop dead.

              23   ANGLE - THEIR POV                                           23

                   A RING OF SUITED FIGURES has them surrounded.

              24   INT. RELIANT - THE BRIDGE                                   24

                   Mr. Beach, the duty officer, stands looking at Ceti

                   Alpha V on the forward screen.

                                           BEACH

                             you please respond, Captain...

                             Captain Terrell, respond please.

                   Nothing.

                                           BEACH

                                     (thinks)

                             Let's give them a little more

                             time.

              25   INT. CARGO HOLD - CETI ALPHA V                              25

                   Terrell and Chekov are held by FOUR STRONG MEN.

                   They seem to be waiting. One of the men is JOACHIM.

                   Out of the airlock steps a tall masked figure. A

                   moment of suspense as Terrell and Chekov watch, terri-

                   fied. The mask is peeled back.

                                           CHEKOV

                                     (aloud despite himself)

                             Khan!

                   KHAN is startled by the recognition; comes over and

                   examines Chekov and Terrell.

                                           KHAN

                                     (finally)

                             I don't know you. But you. I never

                             forget a face. Mister Chekov,

                             isn't it?

                                     (wonderingly)

                             I never thought to see your face

                             again.

                                           TERRELL

                             Chekov, who is this man?

                                           CHEKOV

                             A criminal, Captain -- a product of

                             the late 20th Century genetic

                             engineering --

                                           TERRELL

                             What do you want with us? I demand --

                                           KHAN

                                     (mild)

                             You are in a position to demand

                             nothing, sir. I, on the other hand,

                             am in a position to grant nothing.

                             What you see is all that remains of

                             the ship's company and the crew of the

Botany Bay

, marooned here fifteen

                             years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.

                                           TERRELL

                             Listen to me -- you men and women --

                                           KHAN

                             Save your strength, Captain, these

                             people have sworn to live and die at

                             my command two hundred years before

                             you were born. Do you mean he...

                                      (i.e. Chekov)

                             ... never told you the tale?

                             To amuse you, Captain? Never told

                             you how the 

Enterprise

 picked up the

Botany Bay

, lost in space from the

                             year 1996, myself and the ship's

                             company in cryogenic freeze?

                                           TERRELL

                             I've never even met Admiral Kirk --

                                           KHAN

                             Admiral? He didn't tell you how

Admiral

 Kirk sent seventy of us into

                             exile on this barren sand heap with

                             only the contents of these cargo bays

                             to sustain us?

                                           CHEKOV

                             You lie! On Ceti Alpha V there was

                             life, a fair chance to --

                                           KHAN

This is Ceti Alpha V

! Ceti Alpha VI

                             exploded six months after we were

                             left here. The shock shifted the

                             orbit of 

this

 planet and everything

                             was laid waste. 

Admiral

 Kirk never

                             bothered to check on our progress.

                             It was only the fact of my genetically

                             engineered intellect that enabled us

                             to survive! On earth, two hundred

                             years ago, I was a prince, with power

                             over millions -- now, like Prometheus

                             I have been left by Admiral Kirk to

                             digest my own entrails.

                                           CHEKOV

                             Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid

                             his hospitality by trying to steal his

                             ship and murder him.

                                           KHAN

                                     (moves closer)

                             And I'll wager he never told you

                             about his shipmate, the beautiful

                             and courageous Lieutenant McGiver,

                             who gave up everything to join me

                             in exile. OUT OF LOVE. And see how

Admiral Kirk

 requited her devotion --

                             She's dead as earth!

                   The wind howls in the silence. When Khan turns, his

                   eyes are filled with tears.

                                           KHAN

                                     (continuing)

                             A plague upon you all.

                   He recovers his poise and returns to them --

                                           KHAN

                                     (continuing)

                             You didn't expect to find me.

                             You thought this was Ceti Alpha VI.

                             Why are you here?

                   They don't answer. Khan goes over to Terrell and, WITH

                   ONE HAND, LIFTS HIM INTO THE AIR --

                                           KHAN

                                     (continuing)

                             Why?

                   Terrell gasps, stays silent --

                                           KHAN

                                     (continuing)

                             No matter.

                   He lets go; Terrell falls with a thud --

                                           KHAN

                                     (continuing)

                             You will soon tell me willingly

                             enough.

                   He goes over to the tank and dips a kind of strainer in,

                   pulling out TWO CETI EELS -- wriggling items --

                                           KHAN

                                     (continuing)

                             Let me introduce you to Ceti Alpha V's

                             only remaining indigenous life form;

                             what do you think? They've killed

                             twenty of my people, including my

                             beloved wife. Oh, not all at once

                             and not instantly, to be sure. Their

                             young enter through the ears and wrap

                             themselves around the cerebral cortex.

                             This has the effect of rendering the

                             victim 

extremely

                             follows madness, paralysis -- and

                             death. These are pets, of course --

                   As he speaks, Khan dumps an eel in each of their helmets;

                   he swirls the helmets around as though he were mixing

                   martinis --

                             was only doing his duty! You --

                             There is some pain at first, I am

                             told, and then the effects are quite

                             benign -- until the end. That was

                             what I learned from watching my wife.

                   At a sign, the helmets are slammed down. As the muffled

                   shrieks are heard from within, the eels crawl across

                   the faces of Chekov and Terrell; with unerring in-

                   stincts they head for the ears of the two hapless men.

                   There is some atrocious pain as they enter -- then

                   dazed calm.

                             That's better! Now: tell me why

                             you are here -- and tell me where I

                             I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on

                             the Comm, telling me his troubles?

                             Have you any idea the ribbing I've

                             had to endure in the officers' mess

                             to the effect that the Enterprise

                             is a flying death trap?

                                           PRESTON

                                     (scandalized)

                             Oh, no, sir! This is the finest

                             engine room in the whole Star --

                   The repressed grins of the others, and a smile on Scotty's

                   face tell Preston he's being had. He stops, confused.

                                           PRESTON

                                     (continuing)

                             If the Admiral can't see the facts

                             for himself, then, with all due

                             respect, he's as blind as a Tiberion

                             bat. SIR.

                   Approving laughter. Kirk looks amused.

                                           KIRK

                             Midshipman, you're a tiger.

                                           SCOTTY

                             My sister's youngest, Admiral.

                             Crazy to get to space.

                                           KIRK

                             Every young boy's fancy. I seem

                             to remember it myself.

                                     (brisk)

                             Very well. Mr. Scott, are your

                             engines capable of handling a minor

                             training cruise?

                                           SCOTTY

                             Give the word, Admiral.

                                           KIRK

                             Mr. Scott, the word is given.

                                           SCOTTY

                             Aye, sir.

                   He moves off, followed by Preston, who gives one last

                   salute as Kirk leaves, followed by Bones.

                                           BONES

                                     (dry)

                             What about the rest of the

                             inspection, Admiral?

                                           KIRK

                             The inspection will continue once

                             we're underway, Doctor.

                   Spock is in the Captain's chair, Saavik in the First

                   Saavik watches instruments, punches data in response.

                                           SAAVIK

                             All moorings are clear, Captain.

                                           SPOCK

                             Thank you, Mr. Saavik.

                   Spock casts a glance at Kirk, then, to Saavik:

                                           SPOCK

                                     (continuing)

                             Lieutenant, how many times have you

                             piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?

                                           SAAVIK

                             Never, sir.

                   Kirk tries to conceal his reaction. Spock enjoys it.

                                           SPOCK

                             Take her out, Mr. Saavik.

                                           SAAVIK

                             Aye, sir.

                   Saavik settles herself in the chair, looks again at

                   the console -- Spock looks at Kirk.

                                           SPOCK

                             There's a first time for everything,

                             Admiral.

                             To be sure, Captain.

                   They all stifle their responses. Kirk is like a father

                   watching his kid drive the family car for the first time.

                                           SAAVIK

                   Kirk starts to say something, but doesn't. Bones looks

                   at him.

                                           BONES

                   Kirk shakes his head, takes a breath --

                   Kirk quietly lets his breath out.

                                           SULU

                             We are clear and free to navigate.

                                           SAAVIK

                             Course heading, Captain?

                   Spock turns inquiringly to Kirk.

                                           KIRK

                             Captain's discretion.

                   Spock digests this with a slight smile.

                                           SPOCK

                             Mr. Sulu, you may follow your nose.

                   lowers in their odd-looking clothes.

                             me to memorize her technical manuals.

                             And now, Mr. Chekov, let us review:

                             Beyond what I told you, sir, it is

                             classified information.

                             Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have

                             access to such information?

                                           CHEKOV

                             I would think so, sir. He's on the

                             Fleet General Staff.

                             May I speak? We're all with you,

                             sir, but consider: we are free,

                             we have a ship and the means to

                             go where we will. We have

                             the plans of Admiral Kirk.

                             You do not need to defeat him

                             again.

                             I don't think there's another piece

                             of information we could squeeze

                             into the memory banks. Next

                             time, we'll design a bigger

                             one.

                             Who --

                   Jedda at the Comm Console overlaps.

                                           JEDDA

                             Comm-Pic coming in on hyperchannel

                             ... It's Reliant.

                   Carol moves forward as the others close in.

                             On the screen, please, Jedda.

                   Buttons punched; the screen ebbs, flows and crackles

                   on. ON SCREEN is CHEKOV.

                             ... come in, please. This is Reliant

                             calling Regula I. Repeat. This is

                             USS Reliant --

                                           CAROL

                             Commander, we are receiving. This

                             is Regula I. Go ahead.

                                           CHEKOV

                             Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route

                             to you and should be there in three

                             days.

                                           CAROL

                             En route? Why? We weren't expecting

                             you for another three months. Has

                             something happened?

                                     (pause)

Has something happened

? Do you read 

                             us?

                                           CHEKOV

                                     (fractional pause)

                             All went well. Nothing has happened.

                             Ceti Alpha VI has checked out.

                   Pleased reaction from the scientists.

                                           CAROL

                             I still don't under --

                                           CHEKOV

                             We have received new orders. Upon our

                             arrival at Regula I, all materials of

                             Project Genesis will be transferred to

                             this ship for immediate testing at

                             Ceti Alpha VI.

                   Consternation in the lab. David is livid -- the words

                   "Bullshit" are overlapped  by his mother.

                                           CAROL

Will you please be quiet

!

                                     (back to console)

                             Commander Chekov, this is completely

                             irregular. Who gave the order you

                             are quoting? Who gave the order?

                                           CHEKOV

                                     (still smiling)

                             The order comes from Starfleet

                             command, Dr. Marcus, direct from

                             the General Staff.

                                           CAROL

                             But Genesis is a civilian project,

                             under my control --

                                           CHEKOV

                             I have my orders.

                                           DAVID

                             Pin him down, mother! Who gave the

                             orders!?

                   Chekov hesitates, seems to be listening to someone off

                   the monitor.

                                           CHEKOV

                             The orders come from Admiral James

                             T. Kirk.

                   Sensation in the lab.

                                           DAVID

                             I knew it! I knew it! All along

                             the military has wanted to get their

                             hands on this --

                   He starts to press a button; Carol pushes his hand

                   away and communicates herself.

                                           CAROL

                             This is completely improper,

                             Commander Chekov. I have no

                             intention of allowing Reliant or

                             any other unauthorized personnel

                             access to our work or materials.

                                           CHEKOV

                                     (pauses; listens)

                             I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor.

                             Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed.

                             Please prepare to deliver Genesis to

                             us upon our arrival. Reliant out.

                   The image fades.

                   Chekov, in a matched cut, turns away as CAMERA WIDENS

                             You realize, sir, that they will

                             attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and

                             confirm the order.

                   Khan smiles, more charming than ever as we move in.

                             Will you please be quiet! We must

                             have order here.

                             This has to be some sort of mistake.

                             Mistake? We're all alone here.

                             They waited until everyone was on

                             shift-leave to do this. Reliant is

                             supposed to be at our disposal, not

                             It seems clear that Starfleet never

                             intended that --

                             I've tried to warn you. Scientists

                             are always pawns of the military --

                             Starfleet has kept the peace for

                             a hundred years, I cannot and

                             will not subscribe to your 

                             interpretation of this event.

                             You may be right, Doctor, but what

                             about Reliant? She's on her way.

                   Carol reacts: this is certainly true.

                                           CAROL

                             Get your gear together where it's

                             handy.

                             That's for us to know and Reliant

                             to find out. We have only three

                             days. Let's not waste time.

                   Kirk waits for the Turbo Lift, which opens at last. As

                   he gets in --

                                           SAAVIK'S VOICE

                             Hold please -- !

                   Kirk holds and Saavik dashes in. She is surprised to

                   see him.

                                           SAAVIK

                             Thank you, sir.

                   Kirk nods, the doors close. There is an uneasy forced

                   intimacy between them.

                                           KIRK

                             Lieutenant, are you wearing your

                                           SAAVIK

                             It is still regulation, Admiral.

                   She reaches out and touches a button. The lift stops.

                             seem to be one of your problems.

                             I did not think so.

                             There is no correct resolution.

                             It is a test of character.

                   attraction is mutual and she has no idea how to handle

                   it.

                   He reacts to them. Saavik exits demurely.

                             Thank you, sir.

                   Bones enters and the doors close. Kirk studies the

                             That is wise. In any case, were I

                             to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates

                             that the needs of the many outweigh

                   The bridge is shaken badly, screens go dark, fires spark

                   and erupt. ALARMS and SOUND full. Crew personnel try

                   to put out electrical fires, help the fallen --

                   There is a moment. Kirk looks around the battered

                   bridge, and his eyes meet Spock's, and Saavik's.

                   theatre, where Bones works over Preston. Scotty stands

                   by, his lips trembling. Preston opens his eyes, sees

                   Scotty and Kirk.

                   he's safe.

                                           SAAVIK

                             Anything?

                   Kirk looks at her over the rims of the glasses:

                                           KIRK

                             Somebody left the unit on. If

                             everyone else was dead, it implies

                             that no one remained to turn it off.

                             Those people back there bought escape

                             time for Genesis with their lives.

                   Saavik studies the console.

                                           SAAVIK

                             It doesn't make sense. These

                             coordinates are well within

                             Regula -- a plantoid we know to be

                             lifeless and airless.

                             If Stage Two was completed, it was

                             underground -- she said it was going

                             to be underground.

                                           SAAVIK

                             Stage Two of what?

                   Kirk gets it.

                                           KIRK

                                     (on communicator)

                             Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report,

                             Spock?

                                           SPOCK'S VOICE

                             Admiral, if we go by the book, like

                             Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem

                             like days.

                                           KIRK

                                     (beat)

                             I read you, Captain. Let's have it.

                   Fractional pause.

                                           SPOCK'S VOICE

                             The situation is grave, Admiral. We

                             won't have main power for 

six days

                             at least. Auxiliary power has

                             temporarily failed, but maybe we can

                             restore that in 

two days

. By the

                             book, Admiral.

                   Kirk frowns.

                                           KIRK

                             Meaning you can't even beam us back?

                                           SPOCK'S VOICE

                             Not at present.

                   Kirk looks at Saavik and Bones, decides --

                                           KIRK

                             Captain Spock, if you do not hear

                             from us within 

one hour

 your orders

                             are to restore what power you can,

                             take the Enterprise to the nearest

                             Star Base and alert Starfleet

                             command when you are out of jamming

                             Uhura, if you don't hear from us,

                             there won't be anybody behind. Kirk

                             out.

                                     (to Terrell and Chekov)

                             You gentleman can remain here, or...

                                           TERRELL

                             If it's all the same, Admiral, we'd

                             like to share the risk.

                                           KIRK

                                     (hesitates)

                             Very well. Let's go.

                                           BONES

                             Go? 

Where

 are we going?

                                           KIRK

                                     (points to console)

                             Where 

they

 went. Saavik.

                   Kirk walks onto the pods as Saavik works the console,

                   rolling in electronic coding. The others join Kirk.

                                           BONES

                             But what if they went -- nowhere?

                                           KIRK

                             Then this will be your big chance

                             to get away from it all.

                                           SAAVIK

                             Ready.

                   She presses a button, joins them on the pods. Slowly

                   they VANISH.

             123   EXT. SPACE - THE PLANTOID REGULA                           123

                   CAMERA MOVES TOWARD it as the BEAM SOUND continues,

                   with irregularity. The plantoid is ugly and dead.

                   The sound frightens us, and climaxes with:

             124   INT. ROCKY CAVERN - REGULA                                 124

                   The BEAM SOUND screeches, then settles into its comfort-

                   able mode as the FIVE FIGURES FLUCTUATE, FADE, then

                   APPEAR. They look around in wonder and relief.

                                           SAAVIK

                             Admiral --

                   She indicates something O.S. They cross as CAMERA

                   reveals a cave wall stacked with technical materials

                   and crowned by a LARGE PROJECTILE, a giant version

                   of the model we saw earlier. They stare. (N.B. FEATURE

                   GENESIS ARMING CONTROL BOX.)

                             Genesis, I presume.

                   They walk by a group of crates. It all happens very

                   fast: David leaps out and tackles Kirk, throwing him to

                   the ground and landing atop him, a knife at his throat.

                   At the same time, Bones and Saavik reach for their

                   phasers, but Jedda, already armed, steps out. He has

                   them covered and helpless.

                             You're the sonavabitch who

                             committed mass murder up there.

                   He raises the knife --

                                           KIRK

                             I'm Admiral Kirk...

                                           DAVID

We were still there

, you dumb

                             bastard! We could hear the screams

                             all the way to the transporter room --

                   Again he raises the knife --

                             I'm Doctor Marcus!

                   Carol reaches the tunnel entrance to the cave --

                             Mother, go back!

                   Carol sees Kirk --

                             Go back. I'm going to kill him.

                                           CAROL

                                     (takes a breath)

                             You do that and you'll have murdered

                             your father.

                   All react. David and Kirk, facing each other, are

                   turned to stone. Bones, Jedda and Chekov turn to look

                   at Carol, wondering. Terrell very casually takes the

                   phaser from Jedda.

                             I'll hold onto this.

                   But Kirk and Carol ignore them and walk towards each

                   other. There are tears in Carol's eyes. She reaches

                   up, trying to smile and touches his hair --

                                           CAROL

                             You've got a little grey --

                   She can't. Kirk takes her and holds her tightly, look-

                   ing at David, over her shoulder. He stands there,

                   stunned, looking back.

                             David, you're just making this

                             harder --

                             think, Doctor.

                   He and Chekov have their phasers trained on them.

                                           TERRELL

                                     (continuing)

                   David makes a reckless break for Terrell; Saavik

                   instantly throws herself on him bringing him down as

                   Terrell fires, hitting Jedda, who was behind David --

                   a killing ray. Jedda dematerializes. Carol SCREAMS

                   and David reacts with horror and guilt.

                   Most importantly, Chekov begins to tremble. Terrell

                   himself is shaken by his reflexive action. He's in

                   semi-panic.

                                           TERRELL

                             All is well, sir. You have the

                             coordinates to beam up Genesis...

                                           KHAN

                             First things first, Captain. Kill

                             Admiral Kirk.

                   Reactions by all -- only Kirk and Bones are unsurprised.

                   David and Saavik, dazed, fight the urge to do something.

                   Chekov is close to a seizure. Terrell fights conflicting

                   mental signals.

                                           TERRELL

                             Excellency... it is difficult.

                             I try to obey, but --

                                           KHAN'S VOICE

Kill him

.

                   As though tearing off a leach, Terrell grabs at the

                   wrist recorder and flings it to the ground. A shock-

                   wave of pain hits Terrell. He recovers, trembling and

                   tries to obey. Chekov is shaking badly. Terrell aims

                   his phaser at Kirk. Chekov slowly raises his phaser

                   and aims at Terrell, though his hands are like lead.

                   We THINK Chekov is going to do the right thing. Then,

                   shockingly: Terrell turns his phaser on himself.

                                           KHAN'S VOICE

                                     (still emanates from

                                      wrist recorder)

                             Kill him, Terrell. Now.

                   Terrell does, blowing himself into oblivion.

             138   ANGLE - FAVORING CHEKOV                                    138

                   He SCREAMS, horribly, drops his phaser, clutching his

                   head.

                   Bones leaps to his side, pulls an injection device from

                   his belt pack, jabs it into Chekov's arm. Chekov,

                   almost with a sigh of relief, drops.

                                           KHAN'S VOICE

                             Terrell? Chekov -- !

                   From the fallen man's ear, something begins to emerge.

             140   VERY CLOSE - CHEKOV'S EAR                                  140

                   The Ceti eel crawls out. It has grown quite large.

                   Horror from all. Kirk picks up a phaser. As the eel

                   clears Chekov, he fires and destroys it. He shudders,

                   then sees the wrist recorder and grabs it.

                                           KIRK

                   Khan reacts to Kirk's VOICE: electronic shock. He

                   clutches the communicator, his eye-whites rolling.

                             managed to kill just about everyone

                             else, but like a poor marksman, you

                             keep missing the target.

                                           KHAN

                   He punches several buttons.

                   In the Rocky Cavern the transporter beam locks on to the

                   Genesis torpedo and its arming control box.

                   As Kirk and the others watch, horrified, Khan beams up

                   the materials. David tries to reach the torpedo, but

                   Saavik holds him fast --

                                           DAVID

                             Only half of you would get there.

                   The beam disappears and Genesis with it, leaving them

                   alone.

                             kill me, Khan, it was your sole

                   Carol sits on the ground, Chekov's head in her lap,

                   looking at Kirk.

                                           CAROL

                             David was right, wasn't he? It's

                             just to keep them busy.

                                           KIRK

                             Why? Why didn't you tell me?

                                           CAROL

                             How can you ask me that? Were we

                             together? Where we going to be?

                             You had your world and I had mine.

                             I wanted him in mine, not chasing

                             through the universe with his father.

                   Kirk turns away, overcome. She watches him.

                                           CAROL

                                     (continuing)

                             He's a lot like you in many ways.

                             Nothing I could do about it. He's

                             smarter, of course; that goes without

                             saying. Most of Genesis is really

                             his.

                   Her joke doesn't take effect. He doesn't turn.

                             This is it, isn't it? We're never

                             going to get out of here.

                   Kirk says nothing.

                                           CAROL

                                     (continuing)

                             Please. Tell me what you're feeling.

                   Kirk hesitates, comes back and sits next to Chekov; he

                   changes Bones' compress on the ear as he finally speaks.

                                           KIRK

                             There's a man I haven't seen in

                             fifteen years who thinks he's killed

                             me. You show me a son who'd almost be

                             happy to help him. My son. My life

                             that could have been and wasn't. What

                             am I feeling? I'm feeling old --

                             worn out.

                   Carol studies him; gently she sets Chekov's head down

                   on a sweater, then stands.

                                           CAROL

                             Let me show you something that will

                             make you feel young -- young as when

                             the world was new.

                   She offers her hand. Kirk looks at Chekov, who smiles,

                   faint assurance.

                                           CAROL

                                     (continuing)

                             He'll be all right. Come.

                   After a moment's hesitation, Kirk takes her hand and

                   she leads him to the tunnel.

                   TRUCKING BEFORE Carol and Kirk. A rising light falls

                   on their faces as they walk, then run with excitement

                   toward the source. Kirk races ahead...

                   toward an iridescent light at its end, blindingly

                   INTERCUT: THESE TWO ANGLES until WE CAN HARDLY WAIT

                   for Kirk to reach the end of the tunnel, and then,

                   where the rock tunnel ends. Kirk comes out of the

                   tunnel, and his mouth drops open.

                   A huge cavern. Kirk is actually standing at the middle

                   of it. Space extends vastly above and below his point

                   of view. Like Eden, lush growth everywhere, water-

                   falls, and a cobalt blue sky high, high above where a

                   round orb glows sending light and warmth downward.

                   There is a path from where Kirk stands down to the lower

                   level where Bones, and the others are waiting and calling

                   to him. Mist and haze waft gently across the cavern.

                             beam you aboard.

                   Reliant in purplish mass, banking slightly, completing

                   Now, behind Reliant and from below, like a great whale

                   rising from the depths, Enterprise rises vertically,

                   As Uhura's voice continues O.S., Khan pulls himself

                   Kirk emerges to encounter Scotty and Bones. Their

                   looks tell him. He sees the flashing light over the

                   Reactor Room. He dashes for the control panel. Bones

                   grabs him.

                   Kirk's eyes bulge.

                   With stunned understanding, Kirk stumbles to the door,

                   sees Spock on his knees, hands blackened, face cracked

                   with radiation lines and scars.

                   Spock shakes his head. With a feeble hand he reaches

                   the intercom button: filtered communication.

                             logical: the good of the many

                             outweighs --

                   He almost keels over. Kirk has tears streaming down

                   his face.

                             Or the one.

                   He props a hand on the glass to support himself. Kirk's

                   hand reflexively goes to match Spock's on the other side

                   of the glass --

                             think of my solution?

                   Spock falls. Bones and Scotty react.

                             nourish. He did not feel that

                             and we will not debate his profound

                             wisdom, in these proceedings. Of

                             my friend, I can only say this, that

                   streaming tears. Kirk can't go on.

                             but I would prefer...

                                           SAAVIK

                             Understood, sir.

                                           KIRK

                                     (aloud)

                             Dismiss the company.

                   They salute. She about-faces as Kirk walks towards

                   the  Turbo Lift. Saavik issues dismissal and posting 

                   orders, but WE TRUCK with Kirk until CAMERA STOPS and

                   he leaves FRAME and WE HOLD on David. He finally

                   understands.

             245   INT. KIRK'S QUARTERS                                       245

                   After a long moment, the CAMERA DISCOVERS Kirk. He

                   pours a drink, then decides not to have it.

                   He sits wearily, not knowing how to shake the ghosts.

                   Then he sees the book.

                   Kirk picks up the battered volume, the gift from his

                   friend, and closes his eyes a moment. Almost idly

                   he starts turning pages, looking for a clue. But he

                   can't see the writing -- he rummages through his

                   pockets and pulls out the half-glasses --

                   One of the lenses is broken. It has a deep impact on

                   Kirk. He puts down the book and glasses and covers

                   his eyes.

                   A SOFT BONG. Kirk clears his throat.

                                           KIRK

                             Yes... come.

                   The door whooshes open and closes to admit David. The

                   last person Kirk expected to see.

                                           DAVID

                             I don't mean to intrude.

                                           KIRK

                             Uh, no...

                                     (rises)

                             I should be on the bridge.

                                           DAVID

                             Are you running away from me?

                   David's strength is turning a corner with Kirk --

                                           KIRK

                             I suppose I was.

                                     (pause)

                             I poured a drink. Would you like

                             it?

                                           DAVID

                             No. I -- I guess I'm not what you

                             expected.

                                           KIRK

                                     (rueful)

                             I didn't expect anything.

                                           DAVID

                             That makes two of us.

                                     (he studies his

                                      father)

                             Lieutenant Saavik was right: you

                             never have faced death --

                                           KIRK

                                     (hoarse)

                             Not like this -- no. I haven't faced

                             death, I cheated death. I tricked

                             my way out of death and patted myself

                             on the back for my ingenuity. I

                             know nothing.

                                           DAVID

                             You knew enough to tell Saavik that

                             how we face death is at least as

                             important as how we face life --

                                           KIRK

                             It was just words.

                                           DAVID

                             But good words. That's where ideas

                             begin. Maybe you should listen to

                             them.

                                           KIRK

                             I'm trying, David.

                                           DAVID

                             So am I. My friends were killed,

                             too.

                                           KIRK

                             I am truly sorry.

                   Pause. They study each other.

                                           DAVID

                             I was wrong about you. And 

I'm

                             sorry.

                                           KIRK

                             Is that what you came here to say?

                                           DAVID

                             Mainly.

                                     (he starts out,

                                      then turns -- )

                             And also that I'm proud -- very

                             proud -- to be your son.

                   A stunned moment, then Kirk lets it all hang out: for

                   David, for Carol and for Spock. He hugs his son, hold-

                   ing onto him as if to life itself.

                   The door whooshes. Kirk strides on the bridge, David

                   with him. Carol is there with Bones; they are glad at

                   what they see.

                                           SAAVIK

                             Admiral on the bridge!

                             As you were, Mr. Saavik.

                             my, uh, son --

                   Saavik comes close to blushing --

                             Yes, well, why don't you show him

                             around and...

                                           SAAVIK

                             Aye, sir --

                   She takes him off, deadpan amusement --

                                           SAAVIK

                                     (continuing)

                             So 

you

 turn out to be the dumb

                             bastard.

                   They stare at her.

                                           SAAVIK

                                     (continuing)

                             That is a little joke.

                   Kirk has a smile. He joins Bones and Carol facing the

                   screen.

                                           BONES

                             Will you look at that? Think

                             they'll name it for you, Doctor?

                                           CAROL

                             Not if I can help it. We'll name

                             it for our friend.

                             than I have ever done before... a

                                           CAROL

                                     (soft)

                             Is that a poem?

                   He shakes his head, remembering --

                   He turns to Saavik and David --
