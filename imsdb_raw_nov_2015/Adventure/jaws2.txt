               FADE IN:

               UNDERWATER - DAY

               Dramatically lit by sunlight filtering down from the surface.

               A dim shape, massive, threatening, swims towards us from the 

               distance. Then it divides -- what was one is two, and the 

               shape becomes reality; two divers in Scuba gear swimming 

               side by side. They are wearing minimal rubber, considering 

               the cool New England waters: "Farmer John" wetsuits with cut-

               off legs, assorted sport-diving paraphernalia, including an 

               expensive camera with a flash attachment.

               One motions "Down there," the other signals "OK, I see it," 

               and they dive deeper, into darker waters, where the shafts 

               of sunlight pour into the depths, broken up by seaweed and 

               floating vegetation into cathedral-like columns of 

               illumination.

               SEA BOTTOM - DAY

               The wreck of the working fisherman's boat "ORCA," formerly 

               under the command of the late Captain Quint, deceased these 

               four years.

               Buried in the sand near it, still connected by rusting strands 

               of cable, the mangled remains of a shark cage, glimmering 

               with stainless steel highlights. A fitful flash of yellow 

               from under a mossy beard -- a battered barrel, similarly 

               tangled.

               The divers, Bert and Ernie, appear. They're fascinated by 

               the find, and Bert, with the camera, snaps a few flash shots. 

               The rapid sequence of flashes signals the presence of a motor 

               drive camera.

               ANOTHER POINT OF VIEW

               Distant flashes, obscured by vegetation in the foreground.

               SEA BOTTOM, THE ORCA

               Ernie is exploring the abandoned cabin; doors open and shut, 

               moved by invisible currents stirred by his passage.

               An occasional "Flash!" lights up the bottom as Bert continues 

               snapping away souvenir shots of this local landmark.

               BERT'S POINT OF VIEW - CAMERA VIEWFINDER (PROCESS)

               Ernie floats up out of a hatch, sees the camera, and strikes 

               a pose, clowning for the photographer's benefit. A big hand, 

               f.g., motions him up into clear water for a formal portrait.

               He obliges. Now he floats in front of us, gently paddling 

               his flippers to maintain vertical stability. One flash.

               Another. Then a large, dim movement in the b.g.

               Something's out there, moving towards us.

               Flash. It's bigger, bearing down like a train in a tunnel.

               Flash! It's on us. Flash! Teeth? Blood? Flash! Blackness, 

               Death.

               OCEAN BOTTOM, INSERT

               The camera floats gently down and settles in the sand. A 

               dark red mist eddies by. A last weak flash.

                                                         MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. OCEAN - SUNDOWN

               Flash! An expensive cabin cruiser, the "Diver Working" flag 

               fluttering limply in the breeze, is riding alone at anchor.

               Flash! A distant lighthouse beacon winks at us. The boat 

               rocks in the ceaseless swell.

               On the stern, "Elizabeth T. - Newport, R.I." A long way from 

               home...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. AMITY BEACH - DAY

               A blue-and-white police jeep is bouncing over the sand. A 

               figure in civilian clothes driving alone on some urgent 

               mission. It's Martin Brody, Chief of Police on Amity.

               The jeep slows to a stop, and he takes a flight of stairs 

               leading to a concrete patio two at a time. A classical trumpet 

               solo is playing in the background. Brody charges through a 

               door, then abruptly slows and starts moving warily through a 

               hotel interior: The Holidome, a three-story extravaganza of 

               a motel, where some sort of formal ceremony is already in 

               progress. A banner announces: "Grand Opening Ball -- Amity 

               Scholarship Fund Benefit." Brody crosses under a High School 

               band, arranged dance-band style on a balcony; the trumpet 

               player, Polo, is finishing his solo, the assembled crowd 

               applauds politely. Brody is taking his place with some 

               dignitaries on the dais, as the presiding authority, Amity 

               Mayor Larry Vaughn, begins speaking.

                                     VAUGHN

                         Thank you, Paul Lohman, for that 

                         eloquent solo. Now, for that point 

                         in the ceremonies where we formally 

                         dedicate this magnificent resort-

                         hotel complex, a worthwhile addition 

                         to the recreational paradise we call 

                         Amity.

               ANGLE ON THE DAIS

               Seated on folding chairs, wearing their good suits, several 

               of Amity's Selectmen, Real Estate Developer Len Peterson, 

               and Ellen Brody, very chic. Brody slips into the vacant chair 

               next to her. The following is conducted in urgent whispers, 

               sotto voce, while Vaughn drones on.

                                     ELLEN

                         Where the hell were you?

                                     BRODY

                         Late.

                                     ELLEN

                         I can see that. Don't you know this 

                         is a big deal?

                         BRODY

                 Couldn't help it. 

                 Hendricks over there...

                    (he indicates his 

                    deputy)

                 ...still has the keys 

                 to the jeep in his 

                 pocket, and I couldn't 

                 find the spares.

                         ELLEN

                 Terrific. Act as if 

                 you've been here all 

                 along.

                         BRODY

                 How'm I supposed to do 

                 that?

                         ELLEN

                 Look bored. 

                                                       VAUGHN

                                               past few years have not 

                                               been easy. But today, the 

                                               sun is rising on a new 

                                               Amity, a new island filled 

                                               with promise.

                                               in is likewise a new friend 

                                               who we welcome as family. 

                                               Amity means 'friendship' 

                                               and our community extends

               Brody settles into polite attentiveness, acknowledging a 

               wave from Hendricks, a politely bland young town cop in his 

               idea of civilian finery. Hendricks is fussing with the banner 

               on an attractive young lady in a bathing suit...

               ANGLE ON VAUGHN

                                     VAUGHN

                         ...And now, Tina Wilcox, this year's 

                         Miss Amity, will cut the ribbon that 

                         officially opens this luxurious new 

                         hotel...

               Tina (the girl in the bathing suit) escapes Hendricks' 

               attentions, and teeters on high heels towards the ribbon, 

               while Phil Fogarty, the local photographer, snaps away.

                                     VAUGHN

                         Tina was selected from more than 20 

                         of this island's lovely young

                         ladies in the Miss Amity competition 

                         held every spring, and she'll 

                         represent Amity Island in the Miss 

                         Massachusetts Competition in Worcester 

                         next month. When she cuts this ribbon, 

                         she will be opening our island to 

                         growth, to development, to planned 

                         expansion with full employment for 

                         our thriving community.

               ANGLE ON THE BAND

               Paul Lohman ("Polo" to his friends) is exchanging whispers 

               with Lucy, a flute player nearby.

                                     LUCY

                         I don't think she's such hot stuff.

                         Not tonight.

                         You going with Patrick?

               Lucy nods, Polo shrugs, and turns to Jane, a girl nearby.

                                     POLO

                         Listen, Jane -- you want to dance as 

                         soon as we get out of these monkey 

                         suits?

               She nods happily, they whisper together, while we:

               Martin and Ellen have been joined by their youngest son,

                         This money tree, you may have noticed,

               Applause from the crowd, Len takes a bow.

               ANGLE ON TINA

               as she reaches out with the scissors. Something catches her 

               eye, and she winks at her boyfriend, Ed Marchand, smirking 

               in the crowd. He winks back, and makes "Cut it" motions with 

               his fingers.

               ANGLE ON THE CEREMONY

               Tina cuts the ribbon, and Tom Andrews, a local diver, pushes 

               a decorated float out into the pool; sparklers sputter, 

               balloons drop from the ceiling.

               The band swings into "Downtown," and the crowd gets up to 

               dance, to eat, and to break into small groups to talk.

               Tina and Ed, Tom Andrews and Jane, Marge, other interesting 

               Amity townspeople.

                                     BRODY

                              (seeing Peterson and 

                              Vaughn)

                         Do I have to talk to those two?

                                     ELLEN

                         My boss and your boss. Sure.

                                     VAUGHN

                         Hello, hello. It went well, I thought.

                                     BRODY

                         Very impressive ceremony. Good speech.

                                     VAUGHN

                         Thank you, thank you. You know my 

                         son, don't you?

               He beckons over their heads to Larry Vaughn, Jr., a young 

               man uncomfortable in his correct tie and blazer. They exchange 

               perfunctory greetings.

                                     PETERSON

                         The speech was right on the money.

                              (to Ellen)

                         Be a love and make sure the bar's 

                         open, will you?

               He puts his arm around her, a little too familiarly for 

               Brody's liking.

                                     PETERSON

                              (to Brody)

                         Fantastic lady. Don't know what I'd 

                         do without her.

                                     BRODY

                         Me neither.

                                     PETERSON

                              (looking around)

                         Y'know, Brody -- for the first time 

                         in years it's worth putting money 

                         into this town.

                                     BRODY

                         All of us thank you, okay?

                                     ELLEN

                         Watch Sean for a minute?

               And she hands Sean off to Brody, leaving him with an over-

               active 10 year old, while she's gone.

                                     SEAN

                         Can I go swimming?

                                     BRODY

                         No. Find your brother, okay?

               Sean nods and runs off, happy to have a mission.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANGLE ON MICHAEL BRODY - NEAR THE BAND

               He is talking to Brooke Peters, a mop-maned teen-ager with a 

               pleasant face.

               Timmy Weldon, a grade behind, lurks nearby. A plumpish, curly-

               haired buddy, Andy Nicholas, is enjoying a cup of punch.

                                     MIKE

                         How old is your cousin?

                                     BROOKE

                         Seventeen. She's a senior.

                                     MIKE

                         I'm not crazy about blind dates.

                                     ANDY

                         They're okay, if they got little 

                         white canes and tin cups.

                                     BROOKE

                         That's awful.

                                     ANDY

                         What the hell.

                              (to Mike)

                         Did your mom put all this together?

                                     MIKE

                         Yeah, it's her job.

                                     ANDY

                         Is she responsible for the punch?

                                     MIKE

                         No.

                                     ANDY

                         Good. It's terrible.

                                     BROOKE

                         My cousin will be here tomorrow.

                                     MIKE

                         Great.

               Sean finds them, and bursts into their group.

                                     SEAN

                         Michael, Michael, Dad said to find 

                         you.

                                     ANDY

                         Okay, you did that.

                                     SEAN

                         Come on, Mikey, come on...

               He tugs at Mike's sleeve; Mike allows himself to be dragged 

               off.

                                     MIKE

                         Okay, okay. Got to go.

               Andy and Brooke are left standing together, Tim moves in.

                                     TIM

                              (to Brooke)

                         Want to dance?

                              (she shakes her head 

                              "no")

                         Okay. Later?

               On her shrug, as she turns to Andy:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT./EXT. HOLIDOME PATIO/TERRACE - NIGHT

               It's later; night has fallen, the band is playing its version 

               of "When I Fall in Love." Many teen-agers are dancing out on 

               the patio, some adults are dancing inside, the buffet is 

               ravaged, Timmy is watching Brooke, who's dancing with Polo.

               Douglas Fetterman ("Doug") joins him, after asking Marge for 

               a dance and striking out.

                                     DOUG

                         Get a dance yet?

                                     TIMMY

                         Nope.

                                     DOUG

                         Me neither.

                                     TIMMY

                         Who'd you ask?

                                     DOUG

                         Tina Wilcox.

                                     TIMMY

                         You're crazy. She's Ed's girl friend.

                                     DOUG

                         Doesn't hurt to ask. Sometimes the 

                         most beautiful girls are the 

                         loneliest.

                                     TIMMY

                         That's a crock of shit.

                                     DOUG

                         I know.

               Bob Burnside, a tall pal of Larry Vaughn Jr.'s, turns up by 

               their side.

                                     BOB

                         Same tired old faces. You see Vaughn?

                                     DOUG

                         The mayor?

                                     BOB

                         Larry Vaughn Junior?

                              (Doug shrugs)

                         If you see him, tell him I got a six-

                         pack, a blanket, and the Brebner 

                         twins.

               He exits, on the prowl.

                                     TIMMY

                         No class.

                                     DOUG

                         None at all.

                              (pause)

                         I wonder what the Brebner twins are 

                         doing tomorrow night.

               ANGLE ON BRODY AND ELLEN

                                     BRODY

                         Can you take a little time out from 

                         your busy schedule to dance with the 

                         old man?

                                     ELLEN

                         Why?

                                     BRODY

                         Because they're playing our song.

               And sure enough, they are -- the band has turned to a Fifties 

               slow-dance standard: "I Wish You Love." Peterson approaches.

                                     PETERSON

                         May I have this dance?

                                     BRODY

                         Sorry, I'm all booked up...

                              (taking Ellen)

                         Come, m'dear.

               They slowly fox trot out onto the terrace. Both of them 

               nodding greetings to townspeople and kids -- everyone knows 

               the chief.

                                     BRODY

                         Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?

                                     ELLEN

                         And how. I thought you wouldn't 

                         respect me.

                                     BRODY

                         I did, I did.

               The music and the summer moon are working their magic.

                                     BRODY

                         Listen -- what are you doing later?

                                     ELLEN

                         Fooling around?

                                     BRODY

                         Right.

               He dips with her; they look up and notice Sean, sound asleep 

               on a bench.

                                     ELLEN

                         Let's get the kid home.

                                     BRODY

                         Home it is.

               He crosses to the sleepy Sean and hoists him with a grunt.

                                     BRODY

                              (to the kid)

                         You're getting a little big for this.

               Sean murmurs sleepily and hugs his dad. Mike, dancing with 

               Marge, waves good-bye. The Brodys start to leave, passing a 

               bucket with a bottle of champagne still in it. They exchange 

               a look, nod agreement, and Brody boosts the bottle, sneaking 

               it out of the building while Ellen giggles.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BRODY BEDROOM - DAY

               Brody and Ellen are snuggling under the covers while early 

               morning light streams under the blinds. It's The Morning 

               After, and the clothes from the night before are scattered 

               all over the room. Brody rolls against Ellen, spoon-fashion, 

               morning-horny.

                                     BRODY

                         Mmmm.

                                     ELLEN

                         MMMmmmorning...

               They start to move a little, then turn face to face. Outside 

               their door, the sounds of little feet; Sean padding 

               downstairs.

                                     BRODY

                         Sean's awake.

                                     ELLEN

                         Door's locked.

                                     BRODY

                              (kissing)

                         Good.

               Their bodies move under the blankets. There's a crash from 

               the kitchen. They stop for a beat. As they resume, little 

               feet return.

                                     SEAN'S VOICE

                         The milk fell out of the 'frigerator.

                                     ELLEN

                              (whispering)

                         Put a towel down. And shh -- daddy's 

                         sleeping.

                                     SEAN'S VOICE

                         Okay.

               His feet paddle off. Brody and Ellen start to slide together, 

               passion resumes.

                                     ELLEN

                         C'mere...

               Bigger feet go downstairs; Michael's up. The Brodys kiss, 

               trying to ignore the sounds of spirited discussion between 

               brothers over who's responsible for spilled milk. Then the 

               sound of a car pulling into the driveway, and a horn beep.

                                     BRODY

                         Mrs. Silvera?

                                     ELLEN

                         Mrs. Silvera.

               They try to kiss again, there's a door slam downstairs, and 

               talk between the boys and Mrs. Silvera. The Brodys look at 

               each other and break up laughing at the morning, and 

               themselves.

               ANGLE ON THE BED

               As Ellen and Brody, with the practice of 18 years of marriage, 

               swing back-to-back, and put their feet on the floor, each on 

               their side of the bed, still chuckling, up for the day.

                                     BRODY

                         Need a ride?

                                     ELLEN

                         As far as the office.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. AMITY STREET   DAY

               The police jeep is driving through the picturesque streets, 

               Brody behind the wheel, Ellen and Sean passengers. It slows 

               near the foot of the street, dockside, where a real estate 

               office marked "Amity Shores Development, Leonard Peterson, 

               Pres." sits. Peterson's big Cadillac is parked illegally at 

               the curb. It has the Amity Shores logo on its side.

                                     BRODY

                         Some people.

                                     SEAN

                         What's daddy doing?

                                     ELLEN

                         Writing a ticket.

               Brody is out of the car, his pad in his hand.

                                     ELLEN

                         Hey! That's my boss!

                                     BRODY

                         Better yet.

               Peterson, in shirt-sleeves and a tie, hustles out of the 

               office

                                     PETERSON

                         Wait a minute...

                                     BRODY

                         Too late, it's written.

                                     PETERSON

                         Heck of a way to treat a taxpayer.

                              (to Ellen)

                         Don't you have any pull with the 

                         chief, here?

                                     ELLEN

                         Do I have to?

                                     PETERSON

                              (taking the ticket)

                         Better get a sales kit together for 

                         after lunch. I'm taking some prospects 

                         out.

               Ellen kisses Brody, and starts in for her day's work.

                                     ELLEN

                         See you later.

                                     PETERSON

                              (to Brody)

                         Can't we fix it up to get this made 

                         into a green zone or something?

                                     BRODY

                         Len, pay the two dollars.

               Peterson shrugs and goes inside his office. Brody's attention 

               is drawn by some noise by the dock.

               EXT. DOCKSIDE, AMITY - DAY

               Hendricks and an old codger, Red, are working on Amity's 

               newest bit of police equipment; a blue power launch for 

               patrolling local waters. The boat is Hendricks' personal 

               pride and joy.

                                     HENDRICKS

                              (to Red)

                         Tie it off on your left. Your other 

                         left!

               As Red complies, Hendricks spots his boss.

                                     HENDRICKS

                         Good morning!

                                     BRODY

                              (walking onto the 

                              dock, Sean tagging 

                              along)

                         Aren't you off-duty?

                                     HENDRICKS

                         Till noon. This is on my own time.

                              (to Sean)

                         Hi, Shorty.

                                     SEAN

                         I'm not short. I'm eleven.

               There's a hoot from a passing boat horn. Sean waves happily.

               ANGLE ON THE BOAT

               It has slowed to a halt in front of the police berth; it's a 

               scruffy working fisherman, back from the banks with a full 

               load. The Skipper hails Brody.

                                     SKIPPER

                         Yo! Chief!

                                     BRODY

                         What?

                                     SKIPPER

                         You got a gold-plater drifting in 

                         the main channel. Big cruiser.

                                     HENDRICKS

                         Whereabouts?

                                     SKIPPER

                         Off the Point. No running lights, 

                         just a diver's flag.

                                     HENDRICKS

                              (aside to Brody)

                         Want me to run out there?

                                     BRODY

                         On your own time?

                                     HENDRICKS

                         Happy to do it.

                                     BRODY

                         Then check it out. I'll be in the 

                         office.

               Hendricks nods, and starts the engine importantly.

                                     HENDRICKS

                         Cast off your bow line. And your 

                         stern line. Spring line...

               While Red grumbles, Brody and Sean are walking up to the 

               street.

               Michael and some teen-agers are headed down to the dock.

               ANGLE ON BRODY AND THE KIDS

               It's Mike, Polo, Patrick, Lucy, Brooke, Ed and Tina.

                                     BRODY

                         Where to?

                                     MIKE

                         No place special. Just hanging out.

                                     BRODY

                         Sailing?

               Mike nods.

                                     BRODY

                         Watch your kid brother, huh?

               He gets into his jeep, leaving Sean with the teen-agers.

                                     BROOKE

                         Bye, Mr. Brody.

               The others ad lib appropriate greetings/good-byes, as Brody 

               drives off in his jeep.

               EXT. DOCKSIDE - DAY

               The Kids busy themselves with their boats while Sean hovers 

               around Mike, who's not happy at baby-sitting his kid brother.

                         POLO

                 Anyone want to sail to 

                 the lighthouse?

                         PATRICK

                 Machs nix to me.

                         LUCY

                 Anyone got a spare 

                 mooring line? Mine's 

                 shot.

                         TINA

                 I've got one...

                                                       SEAN

                                               Can I go too?

                                                       MIKE

                                               No.

                                                       SEAN

                                               Please.

                                                       MIKE

                                               I said, 'No.'

               Tina's in her boat, "Tina's Joy," a neat sloop. Mike is going 

               over his "Green Machine," a sleek catamaran.

                                     BROOKE

                         You're not going out right away, are 

                         you?

                                     MIKE

                         Waiting for Andy.

                                     BROOKE

                         I want you to meet my cousin.

                                     MIKE

                         I will, I will.

                                     SEAN

                         I want to go out with you. You need 

                         a crew, don't you?

               Before Sean can protest further, Mike spots his crew: Andy 

               Nicholas, a round-faced, frizzy-haired pal, wearing a bathing 

               suit, and carrying some scuba gear from an early-morning 

               diving class. Marge and Denise, two other divers, are with 

               him, with their gear. They ad-lib "good-byes."

                                     MIKE

                         I don't need you. Andy's here.

                                     SEAN

                         You always go with Andy.

                                     MIKE

                              (to Andy)

                         How was dive class?

                                     ANDY

                         Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble-

                         bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is 

                         some weird shit on the bottom of the 

                         ocean.

                         Shells and lobsters and stuff?

                                     ANDY

                         Mostly old garbage. Today we found a 

                         '48 Hudson.

                                     SEAN

                         Do I have to play with the little 

                         kids?

                                     MIKE

                         Yeah. Go on, beat it.

               Sean mopes away while Andy and Mike get their boat ready for 

               sea.

               FOLLOW SEAN OFF THE DOCK

               Up on the street, where a pretty girl with a sexy face and a 

               provocative post-pubescent walk is asking him directions.

               He points down at the dock. The Girl, Jackie Peters, waves 

               at her cousin, Brooke.

                                     JACKIE

                         Brooke! Hey!

               One of the boats has a portable radio going. It's playing 

               some medium-hot salsa. Jackie does a couple of dance steps 

               on her way down the dock.

               CLOSE ON ANDY AND MIKE

                                     ANDY

                         Who's that? Quick -- I'm in love.

                                     MIKE

                         I hope that's the cousin.

                         Lucky. Lucky, lucky, lucky.

               As the four teen-agers come together in a tight quartet, the 

               music rocks up and we:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Later in the day, sailboats with bright colored sails and 

               ornately painted hulls tack back and forth. Lots of chatter 

               between boats, horseplay, splashing, and general good times.

               It's cruising, on water.

               EXT. HARBOR, ABOARD MIKE'S BOAT - DAY

               with Mike, Andy, Jackie and Brooke.

                         With the right wind, 15-20 knots.

                         What?

                                     MIKE

                         Real fast.

               He sheets in, heeling the boat over in the stiff breeze.

                                     BROOKE

                         Far out!

               Jackie screams in excitement; for a city girl, this is more 

               fun than a roller coaster.

               ANGLE ON A RED CATAMARAN, "SIZZLER"

               overtaking Mike's boat. It's piloted by Larry Vaughn, Jr., 

               the Mayor's Son; with him is his good friend, Bob Burnside.

                                     LARRY

                         Coming up!

                                     BOB

                         Gangway, Turkies!

               It's immediately a race between the red boat -- "Sizzler," 

               and Mike's "Green Machine." The Kids ad-lib -- "Faster," 

               "Lookout," "Gybe, gybe."

                                     ANDY

                         We're carrying weight.

                                     LARRY

                         We'll take your supercargo.

                                     JACKIE

                         Is that me?

                                     BROOKE

                         That's you.

                                     JACKIE

                         I've never been supercargo.

               Donny and Denise's boat cuts in, stealing the Sizzler's air.

                                     LARRY

                         Hey, get out of our air!

                                     DONNY

                         Want a passenger?

               ANGLE ON THE SIZZLER AND FELIX

               Denise hops nimbly from one boat to the other as Danny sails 

               tight as a tick to the red cat.

                                     BOB

                         Way to go!

               QUICK CUTS: FUN AT SEA

               The sailboats cutting up, cruising the harbor, the local 

               teen-agers partying with each other:

               --  Patrick and Lucy's Sol Cat, flying its hull.

               --  Susie's Laser heeled 'way over' in a stiff breeze.

               --  Polo and a pretty girl in his sloop, "Sea Witch."

               --  Timmy Weldon and Doug Fetterman playing catch-up in their 

               respective boats, the Doughdish and the Inflatable.

               --  Marge in her Lightening, sailing close to Ed and Tina in 

               Tina's Joy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               UNDERWATER NEAR THE ORCA - DAY

               Silent, green-blue depths. A diver, Crosby, working the 

               bottom, running a search pattern. Another diver, Tom Andrews, 

               running close. They signal to each other, and make another 

               pass.

               Follow Tom Andrews as he skims the bottom, near the wreck of 

               the Orca, half-buried in the silt. A diver's line runs up 

               and

                                                      OUT OF THE FRAME, TO:

               EXT. OCEAN - DAY

               Bobbing on the surface are three boats: the Amity Police 

               launch, the deserted Elizabeth T., from Newport, flying a 

               diver's flag, and the ScubaVue, a local diveboat operated by 

               Tom Andrews and his partner, Crosby; it has "Amity Aqua 

               Sports" lettered on it somewhere. Hendricks and Red are on 

               the deck of the police boat, peering at the cruiser.

                                     HENDRICKS

                         Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.

                                     RED

                         Figure they split?

                                     HENDRICKS

                         Happens every season -- someone takes 

                         off. Once we had a schooner for a 

                         month while the owners went fox 

                         hunting.

               A sudden eruption in the water nearby startles them -- it's 

               Andrews, surfacing, holding up the underwater flash camera.

                                     ANDREWS

                         This is all there is.

               Crosby pops up next to him, shows empty hands.

                                     HENDRICKS

                         If that's it, that's it.

               The divers head for their boat, Hendricks fires up his engine, 

               and we:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BRODY'S OFFICE - DAY

               Brody is trying to reason with an indignant fat man.

                                     INDIGNANT MAN

                         I can't watch the news, I can't watch 

                         a ball game, I can't watch movies -- 

                         all I hear is that rotten kid with 

                         his rotten radio... "Breaker, 

                         Breaker..."

                                     BRODY

                         I'll do what I can, but you're talking 

                         about a federal jurisdiction...

                                     INDIGNANT MAN

                              (leaving in a huff)

                         So call the FBI!

                                     POLLY

                         Black, two sugars.

                                     BRODY

                         Thanks. What else is out there?

                                     POLLY

                         One petty theft, one domestic 

                         disturbance, and an exhibitionist.

                                     BRODY

                         I'll take the exhibitionist, you 

                         handle the others.

                                     WOMAN

                         Chief Brody? I want you to do 

                         something about my first husband.

               Brody is caught in the open.

                                     WHITE-HAIRED MAN

                         Martin, you have got to demand that 

                         Grace Kinney keep her shades down.

                                     2ND MAN

                         What about enforcing the "No Parking" 

                         ordinance on Beach Road?

                                     BRODY

                         In a minute, in a minute -- talk to 

                         Mrs. Prendergast, please...

                         WOMAN

                    (continuing)

                 Albert keeps coming 

                 around when I'm with 

                 gentlemen friends and 

                 he throws mud on their 

                 cars...

                                                  (eager to be heard)

                                               Every time there's an out-

                                               of-state car in my driveway, 

                                               I lose another mailbox.  

                                               Those little iron sailboats 

                                               cost thirty-two dollars 

                                               each!

                                     BRODY

                              (to White Haired Man)

                         Talk to me about Mrs. Kinney.

                                     WHITE-HAIRED MAN

                         Her bedroom window faces my oldest 

                         boy's bedroom, and she's teasing 

                         him, dancing around in a towel, or 

                         less...

                                     BRODY

                         Dancing?

               Hendricks has entered, carrying the camera brought up from 

               the bottom by the divers.

                                     HENDRICKS

                         Chief...

                                     BRODY

                         Hendricks. I want to go over your 

                         reports and your Form 908.

               They go into Brody's inner office; the uproar continues behind 

               the door, but it's calm in here.

                                     HENDRICKS

                         I never heard of a 908.

                                     BRODY

                         I just made it up. It means, "Get me 

                         out of there."

                              (notices the camera)

                         What the hell's that?

                                     HENDRICKS

                         Diver's camera. Tom Andrews brought 

                         it up from under that abandoned 

                         cruiser.

                                     BRODY

                         Abandoned? It's a little early in 

                         the season for that.

                                     HENDRICKS

                         Rich people. Home port is Newport, 

                         Rhode Island.

                                     BRODY

                         If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as 

                         hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone 

                         in the channel.

                                     HENDRICKS

                         If you had a $100,000 boat there'd 

                         be an investigation.

               Hendricks puts the camera in an informal "Lost & Found" box 

               sitting in the office. Brody makes the mistake of opening 

               the door, revealing the White-Haired Man.

                                     WHITE-HAIRED MAN

                         Grace Kinney is driving my boy to 

                         distraction.

                                     BRODY

                         Hendricks, get a description of that 

                         dance.

                                     LARGE MAN

                              (to Brody)

                         Chief Brody? I want to talk to you 

                         about my daughter... she's 15, but 

                         mature for her age...

                         WOMAN

                 Chief, I've been telling 

                 Mrs. Prendergast that 

                 it's no good just 

                 talking about Albert, 

                 she's got to do 

                 something...

                                                       2ND MAN

                                               Look -- the township is 

                                               responsible for protecting 

                                               life and property, and my 

                                               property is unprotected... 

               As Brody turns to deal with the mess, we:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               UNDERWATER

               Looking up at the surface, where a hull floats in silhouette 

               against the daylight. There's a commotion, and a water ski 

               drops into view. Then another one. Pale legs churn the water.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OCEAN - DAY

               Off Amity Beach, a bilious green lap-straked boat is bobbing 

               in the water, the engine idling. Two girls are fooling around; 

               the one in the water is Terry, the one driving the boat is 

               Diane.

                                     TERRY

                         Did you ever see a dolphin?

                                     DIANE

                         Sure. They like to play. We may see 

                         some today.

                                     TERRY

                         Great!

               She fumbles with her skis.

                                     TERRY

                         Whoops, almost lost one. Can't play 

                         with the dolphins without skis...

                                     DIANE

                         Ready?

                                     TERRY

                         Hang on, hang on... Okay, go.

               Diane goes to the controls, and puts the engine into gear, 

               starting forward. Terry waves "okay," Diane opens up the 

               throttle, the boat surges forward, pulling Terry upright.

               A wake boils out from under her skis.

               ANGLE ON THE BEACH

               Ed and Tina are camped on a blanket, necking in the shelter 

               of the dunes. There's a portable radio, a cooler with some 

               beer, and some sandwiches -- a perfect afternoon alone. Above 

               the dune, behind them lies the ocean, where the girls' ski 

               boat can be seen, raising a big wake. Tina disengages, and 

               sits up, brushing sand out of her hair.

                                     TINA

                         Take a break for a minute, okay?

                                     ED

                         Huh?

               Tina stands, and looks out to the sea, where the boat is 

               towing Terry on the water.

                                     TINA

                         Eddie, can we do that?

                              (no reaction)

                         Can we go skiing? We can use my 

                         Uncle's boat. Eddie?

                                     ED

                         Next week.

                                     TINA

                         With you, everything's next week. I 

                         want to go skiing soon. Tomorrow?

               Ed grunts non-comittally. Tina takes a beer from the cooler, 

               and goes up on the dune to watch Terry and Diane. She waves 

               to them, and to someone down the beach.

               EXT. BEACH HOUSE - DAY

               An old lady, Grace Witherspoon, is rocking on her porch, 

               also enjoying the view of young people enjoying themselves. 

               She acknowledges Tina's distant wave, and turns her attention 

               back to the skiers.

               ANGLE ON THE SKIERS

               having a wonderful time. Terry is good, criss-crossing the 

               wake, showing off.

               CLOSE ON TERRY

               rushing through the water, waving, stunting.

                                     TERRY

                         Faster! Faster!

               She waves at Diane, who leans over the controls, to coax 

               more speed out of the old engine.

               UNDERWATER

               following the skis effortlessly, closing in on the turbulent 

               wake.

               ON THE SURFACE

               Terry whipping along; a fin raises near her. She glances at 

               it, waves, thinking it's a porpoise.

                                     TERRY

                         Porpoise! Look! A dolphin!

               The fin slides low in the water, heading towards her. She 

               puts the rope around her waist, leaving both hands free.

               UNDERWATER

               Closing in on the wake, crossing it.

               TERRY - ON THE SURFACE

               The fin cuts across her path. Too late to maneuver, Terry 

               hits the looming gray back of the Shark. The skis bump, leave 

               the water, Terry takes a spectacular spill. The rope around 

               her waist tows her helpless through the water, gagging her, 

               preventing her from shouting. She flounders as Diane slows 

               the boat to see what's happened.

               ANGLE ON THE BOAT

               turning back to see if her friend hit a submerged log or 

               hurt herself.

                                     DIANE

                         Terry! You okay?

                                     TERRY

                         Help! Help!

                                     DIANE

                         Okay, okay, coming...

               She still doesn't realize the gravity of the situation -- 

               she hasn't seen the fin.

               ANGLE ON TERRY

               hysterical, pulling herself hand-over-hand up the rope, trying 

               to get to the boat.

               UNDERWATER

               Closing in on the thrashing figure.

               TERRY

               Screaming, as the Shark rises from the deep and takes her.

               Suddenly she's gone, a swirl of pink froth marking the water 

               where she went under.

               IN THE BOAT - DIANE

               Looking around for her friend, suddenly panicky. She pulls 

               the rope hard, and tumbles backward as it comes up with 

               nothing on it -- just a cleanly bitten end.

                                     DIANE

                              (screaming)

                         Terry!

               Then the Shark appears, blood on its mouth, lunging up and 

               butting the stern, jarring the engine loose. Fuel spills 

               from a ruptured line.

                                     DIANE

                         Help! God, help!

               She throws things at the Shark, which slides back under the 

               water.

               DISTANT ANGLE ON THE BOAT - FROM THE BEACH

               Diane can be seen flailing in the boat, very distant screams 

               floating across the water; at this range they sound like the 

               normal shrieks of teen-age girls having fun....

               ANGLE ON THE BOAT - CLOSE

               as the Shark hits from a fresh angle, this time taking a 

               chunk out of the boat, biting down with powerful jaws. Diane 

               hurls seat-cushions, oars, anything she can lay hands on.

               She fumbles desperately in a compartment, produces a flare 

               pistol. She cocks it and fires point-blank at the shark.

               CLOSE ON THE SHARK

               The flare hits, wet fuel glistening on the water and skin of 

               the Shark explodes in a sheet of flame.

               DIANE

               A last flash before the gasoline explodes.

                                     DIANE

                         No-o-o-o-o-o...!

               A sheet of fire, she's in the middle, screaming, aflame, the 

               Shark forgotten. She falls into the water as the ruined boat 

               overturns and there's an oily explosion.

               EXT. BEACH - DAY - ED AND TINA

               Ed and Tina look up as they hear the distant "crump" of the 

               boat blowing up.

               EXT. PORCH - DAY

               Mrs. Witherspoon looks up, startled by the sudden tragedy.

               She gets up to go to the phone, indoors, and we:

               The launch is anchored at the site of the explosion, offshore.

               Red is fishing up bits of flotsam with a boathook. Hendricks 

               is on the radio, talking to the shore.

                         I can't find anyone out here. They 

                         must've gone to the bottom, or drifted 

                         with the current.

               BRODY ON SHORE

               He's on the porch of tile Witherspoon house, using his 

               portable walkie-talkie. Mrs. Witherspoon is waiting in the 

               b.g.

               Nearby, we can see a sign: "BURIED CABLE: Call New England 

               Light and Power Before Digging." The cable itself surfaces 

               in a chain-link fenced enclosure, and climbs a power pole 

               for distribution to the island. Ed and Tina are also there, 

               having given statements.

                         There should be bodies. Witnesses

                         skiing.

                         We heard this noise, like a 'boomp' 

                         out there, and when we looked, there 

                         was just this cloud of smoke.

                                     GRACE

                         That was the explosion. One minute 

                         they were having a wonderful time, 

                         the next, bang!

                         I don't know what could've done that.

               Brody stares out at the quiet sea -- what's lurking under 

               that calm surface?

                                     TINA

                         Can we go now?

               Brody's still looking past them, towards the ocean.

                         Chief Brody -- can we go? Please?

               As he gazes at the ocean, we hear the sound of a distant 

               siren, and

               Hendricks has the winch in operation, the cable in his hand, 

               with big grappling hooks attached. The boat is lit by its 

               powerful worklights. Hendricks heaves them out, watches as 

               the current takes them, then puts the winch in gear, hauling 

               back.

               cable from the winch is taut, pulling something up from the 

               black depths. What? The coupling appears, then the hook, and 

               an oily cable.

                         Every day?

                                     MIKE

                         What else is there to do?

                                     BRODY

                         You could work out at the beach, 

                         make a few bucks for school.

                                     MIKE

                         Do I have to?

                                     BRODY

                         You'll have to make up your own mind 

                         about that.

                                     ELLEN

                         Where's my day book?

                                     BRODY

                         In the den.

               Ellen passes them on the way to the den to look for it.

                                     ELLEN

                         He doesn't have to work all the time, 

                         it's his vacation.

               Mrs. Silvera enters from the service porch.

                                     MRS. SILVERA

                         Good morning -- everyone up early 

                         today?

                                     BRODY

                         There's a lot going on.

               He follows Ellen into the den.

               INT. DEN - DAY

               Ellen is rummaging around the papers on the end table, looking 

               for her book.

                                     ELLEN

                         Why don't you take a half day and 

                         clean this junk up?

                                     BRODY

                         Because, I'm in the middle of a 

                         boating accident, I got only four 

                         regular cops and one secretary, and 

                         a Chief Deputy who is constantly 

                         fiddling with the police boat. He's 

                         another one.

                                     ELLEN

                         One what?

                              (she finds the book)

                         Ah-ha!

                                     BRODY

                         Boat nut. What is it about this place 

                         that makes everyone a freak for 

                         boating?

                                     ELLEN

                         It's an island.

                              (she pecks him on the 

                              cheek)

                         Got to run.

               She heads out the door for the office. Mike approaches.

               ANGLE ON MIKE AND BRODY

                                     MIKE

                         I'm going.

                                     BRODY

                         What about tennis? Riding? Fixing up 

                         old cars? Bartending?

                                     MIKE

                         Bartending? I'm 17.

                                     BRODY

                         Okay, not bartending. Why on the 

                         water every day?

                                     MIKE

                         Because.

                                     BRODY

                         Look, humor the old man -- just be 

                         careful.

                                     MIKE

                              (going)

                         I'll be careful. I'll see y'later.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Mike passes through on his way out, nodding to Mrs. Silvera 

               who acknowledges his passage.  Brody is close on his heels.

                                     BRODY

                         Don't go out if it's rough or 

                         anything, huh? We've had a lot of 

                         trouble.

                                     MIKE

                         Okay, okay.

               The back door slams behind him.

                                     SEAN

                         Can I go with you today?

                                     BRODY

                         You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie. 

                         Okay?

               Sean nods, resigning himself to the inevitable.

                                     MRS. SILVERA

                              (to Sean)

                         You can come with me to the market.

                                     SEAN

                         All right.

                                     BRODY

                         I'll be at the office.

               Mrs. Silvera nods, and pours Sean a glass of milk. Brody 

               sighs, and heads out the door. Sean calls after him.

                                     SEAN

                         Bye, Daddy. I'm going to be careful, 

                         all day.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OCEAN - DAY

               Sitting snug and ship-shape on Mike's Green Machine are Mike, 

               Andy, Brooke, and Jackie. They are heeled over in a brisk 

               wind, making good headway; sailing nearby in the b.g. are 

               Patrick and Lucy and Donny and Denise, in their boats.

                                     LUCY

                              (from her boat)

                         Where're we going?

                                     ANDY

                         Oh, out a ways. Maybe the lighthouse.

                                     BROOKE

                         The lighthouse?

                                     ANDY

                         No big thing, we'll see who's out 

                         there, maybe picnic.

                                     MIKE

                         We got some stuff at the store. Ed 

                         and Tina are going to be there.

                                     BROOKE

                         Oh, sure, they would be.

                                     JACKIE

                         What's the lighthouse?

                                     MIKE

                         It's an island, near here, with a 

                         lighthouse. We sometimes hang out 

                         there, you know...

                                     JACKIE

                         Great. I got some wine.

               She opens her big floppy bag, revealing the top half of a 

               jug of Mountain Red. Brooke slides over to her.

               ANGLE ON BROOKE AND JACKIE

                                     BROOKE

                              (aside)

                         The lighthouse is a make-out spot.

                                     JACKIE

                         Now I really want to see it.

                                     BROOKE

                         You going to fool around with Mike?

                              (Jackie shrugs)

                         Well, I'm not doing anything with 

                         him.

               She indicates Andy, who pretends great indifference.

                                     JACKIE

                         Well, maybe I will, then.

               Andy does about a triple take before he regains his cool.

               Mike concentrates on his sailing, Jackie grins an impish, 

               vixen grin, Brooke shrugs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LIGHTHOUSE - DAY

               spectacular view from the top of the old lighthouse, showing 

               ocean, sandy beach, some of the Kids' catamarans pulled up 

               on the sand, other pleasure boats cruising in the b.g.

               Ed and Tina are running down the stairs, laughing.

                                     ED

                         Come on back up here!

               ANGLE ON THE SAND

               where Andy, Mike, Jackie, and Brooke are camped around a 

               blanket listening to a portable radio. Ed and Tina run by.

                         Why'd they decide to move?

                         Too hot for those two? I can't believe 

                         it.

                                     JACKIE

                         Is there something I don't know about?

                         I told you, remember?

                         Oh, yeah. So why aren't they doing 

                         it now?

               There's a little round of giggling.

                                     ANDY

                         Maybe by now they are.

                                     MIKE

                         They're moving pretty fast.

                                     JACKIE

               in f.g., covered with birds. Ed and Tina appear over the 

               crest of a dune, and the frame explodes in a flurry of 

               seagulls, suddenly disturbed. The whir and drumbeat of wings, 

               and the shrieking of the gulls is a jarring shock.

                         Yech!

               HER POINT OF VIEW

               The huge hulk of a beached, decomposing dead whale, a few 

               birds still pecking at scraps of blubber and entrails. Big 

               festering red holes mark its sides.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               LONG SHOT -  SAND AND WHALE

               From the top of the lighthouse, we can see a group of 

               interested spectators, clustered around the whale like ants 

               at a picnic. A few more boats are beached and riding at anchor 

               just off the shore, including the Amity police boat.

               Three Ants are walking towards the crowd, one of them 

               gesturing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANGLE ON BRODY, HENDRICKS AND A WOMAN

               She's Lureen Elkins, a marine biologist from the Oceanographic 

               Institute, and she's skeptical. Brody is the ant whose 

               antennae were waving in the long shot.

                                     BRODY

                         As soon as I heard about it, I called 

                         you. This thing is big!

               His arms indicate big.

                                     ELKINS

                         After we've looked, we'll talk.

                                     HENDRICKS

                         This is it.

               He moves forward to clear the crowd. Some kids are poking 

               the massive hulk with sticks. A tourist couple is snapping 

               away with a Polaroid SX-70. The whole mess stinks, too.

                                     HENDRICKS

                         Move back, please... back off... 

                         open it up a little...

               The crowd edges back, giving way to Brody and Elkins.

                                     BRODY

                         See? What'd I tell you?

               ANGLE ON THE WHALE

               Brody is holding a handkerchief to his nose as he approaches 

               the dead thing, indicating a huge open wound on the side.

                                     BRODY

                         Look at that!

                                     ELKINS

                         First things first.

               She produces a tape measure and gives one end to Brody.

                                     ELKINS

                         From the tip of the snout, please.

               Elkins is measuring the length of the creature. She calls 

               off numbers to Hendricks, who is officiously writing it all 

               down, repeating numbers as he hears them.

                                     ELKINS

                         Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.

                                     BRODY

                         Come on, let's check the bite radius.

                                     ELKINS

                              (cold)

                         The what?

                                     BRODY

                         Bite radius. You know, the size of 

                         the mouth?

                                     ELKINS

                         The whale's mouth?

                                     BRODY

                         The Shark's mouth.

                                     ELKINS

                         What shark?

               Brody pitches his voice low, so that the crowd won't listen.

                                     BRODY

                         The shark that did this. It was a 

                         shark, wasn't it?

                                     ELKINS

                         We don't know that, do we?

                                     BRODY

                         But that's what we're here to find 

                         out, right?

                                     ELKINS

                         You don't tell me my job, and I won't 

                         tell you about yours, okay?

                                     HENDRICKS

                         I can't hear you if you're going to 

                         whisper.

                                     MIKE

                         Can we go now?

               He turns to join the kids as they slip through the crowd to 

               return to their blanket, ad-libbing good-byes.

                                     BRODY

                              (to Mike)

                         You stay here a minute.

                                     MIKE

                         Oh, c'mon.

                                     BRODY

                         You heard me.

                                     JACKIE

                         We'll be over by the lighthouse.

                                     MIKE

                         I'll be right there. Wait up.

               They hang around, waiting for him. Elkins has reclaimed 

               Brody's attention.

                                     ELKINS

                         Could be a shark. But maybe not.

                                     BRODY

                         Look, I know a little bit about 

                         sharks.

                                     ELKINS

                         Do you?

                                     BRODY

                         I know that this was probably a Great 

                         White Shark. Car-cadon... Caradan...

               He fumbles for the correct Latin.

                                     ELKINS

                              (helping out)

                         Carcharadon Carcharias.

                                     BRODY

                         That's it.

                                     ELKINS

                         Okay, so that's it.

                                     BRODY

                         Is there one in these waters?

                                     ELKINS

                         What makes you think there might be?

                                     BRODY

                         Because this big fish has been bitten 

                         by some other big fish...

                                     ELKINS

                         This is a mammal, not a fish.

                                     BRODY

                         Jesus, don't quibble with me. I want 

                         to know if a Great White Shark did 

                         this.

                                     ELKINS

                         Probably.

                                     BRODY

                         That's it? Probably? Look, sharks 

                         are attracted by blood, and thrashing 

                         around...

                                     ELKINS

                         And sound.

                                     BRODY

                              (this is a new one)

                         Sound?

                                     ELKINS

                         Sound. Like sonar, or radar. They 

                         home in on irregular sounds, unusual 

                         sounds, any rhythmic low-frequency 

                         vibration.

                                     BRODY

                         So there's one around here.

                                     ELKINS

                         Not necessarily. These wounds could've 

                         been inflicted 30 miles out to sea, 

                         or more. None of them are immediately 

                         fatal. Currents could've carried the 

                         body 10 miles further.

                                     HENDRICKS

                              (chiming in)

                         We got a helluva tide this month.

                                     BRODY

                         Could you just keep that crowd back, 

                         please?

                                     MIKE

                              (fidgeting)

                         Pop...

                                     BRODY

                         You stay right here. You're going in 

                         with me.

               ANGLE ON BRODY AND MIKE

               As Elkins examines the whale, calling her observations to 

               Hendricks.

                         MIKE

                 We came out in my boat.

                         BRODY

                 Andy can sail in it.

                         MIKE

                 I got a date!

                         BRODY

                 She'll understand.

                         MIKE

                 She won't. 

                                                       ELKINS

                                               Lower jaw displaced and 

                                               lacerated by predator 

                                               attempt to seize the tongue. 

                                               Additional large tissue 

                                               loss in the dorsal and sub-

                                               dorsal areas, as well as 

                                               the caudal. Oriamal bite 

                                               radius 37 inches, allowing 

                                               for salt-water erosion and 

                                               subsequent small predator 

                                               and scavenger tissue 

                                               attacks...

               The Kids have moved a little closer to hear what's going on 

               between father and son.

                                     BRODY

                         I don't want to discuss it.

               Elkins crosses to Brody.

                                     ELKINS

                         It's either a Great White, or another 

                         killer whale.

                                     BRODY

                         Can't you tell?

                                     ELKINS

                         Not when it's like this. This animal 

                         has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, 

                         and drifting for a day, at least. 

                         Every little nibbler in the sea's 

                         taken a bite.

                                     BRODY

                         Look -- can Great White Sharks 

                         communicate? Send out signals, or 

                         something? You know, take revenge, 

                         sense an enemy...

                                     ELKINS

                         Don't be ridiculous -- Sharks don't 

                         take things personally.

                                     MIKE

                         Dad, please...

               Brody turns on him.  This at least, is something he can do 

               something about.

                                     BRODY

                         No more sailing. You come back with 

                         me, and that's it.

                                     MIKE

                         Why me?

                                     BRODY

                         Because I say so.

                                     ANDY

                         I'll tie up at the town dock, don't 

                         worry, man.

                                     JACKIE

                         See you later, Mikey...

                                     ED AND TINA

                         Later, bye...

                              (ad lib)

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. AMITY TOWN HALL - DAY

               Vaughn and Brody enter, walking through the spare, empty 

               town meeting hall, towards the conference table. They are 

               alone.

                                     VAUGHN

                         I'm showing summer rentals. We got a 

                         helluva season going.

                                     BRODY

                         We have got to talk, and we have got 

                         to talk alone.

                                     VAUGHN

                         We're alone.

                                     BRODY

                         Larry, I don't know how to say this, 

                         but I think we got a shark problem. 

                         A real one.

               Vaughn stares at him, then unlocks the door to his private 

               office -- "Mayor" -- and leads Brody in.

               INT. VAUGHN'S OFFICE - DAY

               Small, expensively furnished in antiques, with a few symbols 

               of Amity boosterism cluttering one wall: a photo of the beach, 

               featuring a shark tower; an architect's rendering of the new 

               Holiday Inn, some charts and graphs showing upward progress, 

               a few stills of businessmen's luncheons, plaques, awards, 

               etc.

                                     VAUGHN

                         Are you serious?

                                     BRODY

                         Of course. Look -- I've got some 

                         missing persons, fatalities, evidence 

                         of a large predator...

                                     VAUGHN

                         No one has seen a shark -- no fin, 

                         no bites, nothing. Be realistic.

                                     BRODY

                         I got a feeling. I have to act on it -- 

                         you can understand that, can't you?

                                     VAUGHN

                         Of course I can, but can't it wait? 

                         These things cost money, and this 

                         town doesn't have much money.

                                     BRODY

                         We have to do something.

                                     VAUGHN

                         We have done something -- hell, we 

                         damn near went broke putting up a 

                         shark watch tower on the beach -- 

                         it's the only one in 2000 miles, 

                         y'know.

                                     BRODY

                         I know, I know...

                                     VAUGHN

                         And I stood by while you told the 

                         people from Ramada and Marriott that 

                         if they put up a hotel they'd need 

                         $800,000 worth of steel net around 

                         their beaches! In New England? We 

                         all lost on that one.

                                     BRODY

                         It's still a good idea.

                                     VAUGHN

                         Martin, when we build up our tax 

                         base a little, you can have everything 

                         you want; right now, the town's broke.

                                     BRODY

                         Please, Larry -- there's good reason.

                         Those water skiers...

                                     VAUGHN

                              (interrupting)

                         A tragedy. But that was a boating 

                         accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing 

                         but a boating accident.

                                     BRODY

                         Two of them are still missing!

                                     VAUGHN

                         There's always deaths in these waters 

                         that never turn up. Are they all 

                         shark victims?

                                     BRODY

                         Maybe they are!

               Brody's overstated his case, and he realizes it.

                                     VAUGHN

                         Bullshit.

                                     BRODY

                              (shouting)

                         Bullshit? I'll give you bullshit -- 

                         there's a dead whale out there with 

                         bites all over it!

                                     VAUGHN

                              (shouting back)

                         What am I, an ass? When you called 

                         me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. 

                         Nothing she saw is proof of anything.

                                     BRODY

                         Someone has to do something.

                                     VAUGHN

                              (back in control)

                         Don't push it this time. If you do, 

                         it won't turn out the way you want, 

                         I guarantee you that.

               The two men study each other for a long moment. Then,

                                     VAUGHN

                         I've got to get back to work.

               He holds the door for Brody, who walks out as Vaughn lags 

               behind, locking up his sanctum.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. AMITY BEACH ROAD - DAY (DUSK)

               Brody is alone in the jeep, headed for the safety of home 

               and family. He drives past the town's billboard: it's covered 

               with an architect's rendering of the Amity Holiday Inn. The 

               sign reads: "WHEN IN AMITY, ENJOY THE HOLIDAY INN."

               Plastered across it is an added streamer: "NOW OPEN." Barely 

               visible underneath are older notices: "UNDER CONSTRUCTION," 

               and "OPENING IN JUNE."

               As Brody passes the sign, he impulsively swings off the main 

               road and heads down towards the beach.

               EXT. BEACH - DUSK

               Brody is on restless patrol, checking the water's edge as he 

               continues on home. As he drives along, he sees: a clambake; 

               some teen-agers in a group, necking and dancing; and a few 

               solitary surfcasters and fishermen.

               The beach is deserted, the sun is setting, and Brody and his 

               jeep have the sand to themselves. It's then that he sees 

               something:

               BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW

               A big bow section of a ruined, burnt boat is bobbing in the 

               surf just off the beach ahead. It's a piece of the 

               waterskiers' boat; Brody heads towards it.

               ANGLE ON THE SURF

               As Brody slows his jeep just short of the water, and gets 

               out to look at the flotsam. His shoes get wet. He backs up 

               onto dry sand, then tries to edge closer to examine this 

               object.

               It bobs up and down in the surf; Brody makes "Get in here" 

               motions. The junk resists.

                                     BRODY

                         Come on, give a guy a break.

               No response. He takes off his shoes and socks, and rolls up 

               his trouser legs. A silly sight. He wades into the water 

               after it.

                                     BRODY

                         Come on. Here boy. Come to Poppa...

               It eludes him, and he flounders after it. A big wave breaks 

               across his crotch.

                                     BRODY

                         Hoo! Cold!

               He's almost there, it's just beyond his reach, he's got it, 

               he's lost it, he has it again, it's slippery...

                                     BRODY

                              (ad lib)

                         Come here. Come on, Sweetheart. You 

                         bastard. A little closer... Here 

                         y'go...

               Then, he's got it ---

                                     BRODY

                              (exultant)

                         Gotcha!

               CLOSE ON BRODY IN THE WATER

               As he grabs the ruined wood, and pulls it towards him. 

               Suddenly, the mass of wreckage breaks apart, and something 

               lunges out of the mess and into Brody.

               SHOCK CUT CLOSEUP - "THE THING"

               Brody is suddenly pinned under a soggy charred horror; the 

               gory remains of Diane, burnt beyond recognition,: flesh peeled 

               away, discolored, charred, ruined by days in salt water. He 

               screams, and scrabbles in the wet sand, trying to get out of 

               the dreadful clutches of the half-human thing he's dredged 

               from the water.

               ANGLE ON BRODY

               Extricating himself, puking, retching, splashing water on 

               his face, washing his hands frantically, just behind him, 

               The Thing lying on the sand, a gruesome joke played by the 

               sea.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BRODY'S OFFICE - NIGHT - EXTREME CLOSEUP - CYANIDE 

               BOTTLE

               Macro close on a pharmaceutical bottle of Sodium Cyanide, 

               from which a syringe is withdrawing a healthy dose. Follow 

               the syringe and reveal Brody, working at his desk in the 

               deserted office. He is injecting the deadly chemical into 

               some jacketed .38 hollow-point ammunition; a dozen cartridges 

               are lined up in neat array, he is filling the last of them, 

               sealing the points with wax from a burning red candle. The 

               radio scanner is monitoring the local police band: routine 

               reports faintly in the b.g. -- a slow night in pre-season 

               Amity.

               ANGLE ON BRODY

               As a sound at the door makes him look up. He hides the odd 

               gear as Hendricks enters, starched and crisp in his uniform.

                                     HENDRICKS

                         Chief?

                                     BRODY

                         In here.

                                     HENDRICKS

                         I missed you at the funeral home. 

                         Santos said you were here.

                                     BRODY

                         You didn't miss much. Christ, what a 

                         mess.

                                     HENDRICKS

                         Positive I.D.?

                                     BRODY

                         The woman passenger on the boat that 

                         blew up.

                                     HENDRICKS

                         Oh.

               There's an awkward pause. Brody sees the box with the divers' 

               stuff sitting where it was left earlier.

                                     BRODY

                         What about that camera?

                                     HENDRICKS

                         What camera?

                                     BRODY

                         That one -- from the wreck. You 

                         brought it up, did you look inside 

                         it?

               Hendricks' guilty look confirms he didn't.

                                     BRODY

                         Well, what the hell -- might be 

                         something worth seeing. Take it 

                         somewhere and see if there's film in 

                         it...

                                     HENDRICKS

                              (catching on)

                         If there is, develop it!

                                     BRODY

                         You got it.

               The Deputy rummages in the locker, happy to be on the trail.

                                     HENDRICKS

                         I know just where to go.

                                     BRODY

                         Not the drugstore!

                                     HENDRICKS

                         Of course not, They're closed. Phil 

                         Fogarty's place. He'll do it for me.

                                     BRODY

                         The drugstore's closed? What the 

                         hell time is it?

                                     HENDRICKS

                         Nine-thirty, ten maybe.

                                     BRODY

                         Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close 

                         up, okay?

               And he runs for the door, the speed-loaders with the Cyanide 

               bullets safely in his pocket.

                                     BRODY

                              (at the door)

                         Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long 

                         distance call, very important. Give 

                         them my home phone.

                                     HENDRICKS

                         Right.

               Brody pats his pockets to make sure the speed-loaders are 

               safe inside, then exits. As Hendricks watches him go,

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BRODY HOUSE - NIGHT

               Brody's jeep pulls up, and he gets out, beat. He is slouching 

               towards the door when he hears the phone ring inside. He 

               perks up, and starts to move faster.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BRODY HOUSE - NIGHT

               Ellen is on the phone in the den as Brody enters the house.

               The Kids are on the floor in front of the TV, playing an 

               electronic video game that pings and beeps softly under the 

               following.

                                     ELLEN

                              (into the phone)

                         Thank you. I'll tell him.

                                     BRODY

                         For me?

                                     ELLEN

                              (hanging up)

                         Sort of -- Matthew Hooper is aboard 

                         the research vessel Aurora, presently 

                         in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be 

                         in radio range until half-past next 

                         spring.

                                     BRODY

                         Damn.

               He starts upstairs, casually concealing the towel-wrapped 

               package of gun and ammunition.

                                     MIKE

                         Is Hooper coming to dinner?

                                     BRODY

                         Not till next year.

               He goes upstairs, Ellen waits a few beats, then follows him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BRODY HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - NIGHT

               Brody comes up the stairs and goes into the bedroom, where 

               he carefully puts the gun in the bed table. Ellen finds him.

                                     BRODY

                         Oh, hi -- How was dinner?

                                     ELLEN

                         Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family 

                         affair. Where were you?

                                     BRODY

                              (getting up)

                         Santos' place.

               They both know what that means -- the morgue. Brody goes 

               into the bathroom and starts scrubbing his hands compulsively.

               INT. BRODY HOUSE - BATHROOM AND HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Ellen follows Brody, watches as he washes under too-hot water.

                                     BRODY

                         Oww!

                                     ELLEN

                         Careful. What's wrong?

                                     BRODY

                         Nothing.

                                     ELLEN

                         Nothing, huh?

                                     BRODY

                         That's what I said. Is there any of 

                         that hand cleaner stuff?

                                     ELLEN

                         Use the little brush there. Why were 

                         you at Santos'?

                                     BRODY

                         Found one of the missing victims 

                         from that boat deal.

                                     ELLEN

                         Oh. Want to talk about it?

                                     BRODY

                         No.

                                     ELLEN

                         Terrific.

               Mike comes up the stairs, and is starting into his room when 

               Brody spots him; Sean is just behind him.

                                     BRODY

                         Michael.

                                     MIKE

                         Yeah?

                                     BRODY

                         You want to come here a minute?

               Mike shrugs and crosses to his father; Sean whizzes past on 

               into his room.

                                     SEAN

                         Hi Dad.

                                     BRODY

                         Hiya yourself.

                                     MIKE

                         What is it?

               He expects something: this is a formal audience with the 

               Head of The House.

                                     BRODY

                         I got something for you to do 

                         tomorrow.

                                     MIKE

                         I kind of had plans...

                                     BRODY

                         Sailing?

                              (Mike nods)

                         Forget it. You're beached. Grounded. 

                         No more boats.

                                     MIKE

                         Hey, come on...

                                     BRODY

                         No backtalk! I spoke to Upton, at 

                         the beach, and he's got a job for 

                         you there. You can work until school 

                         starts.

                                     ELLEN

                         All summer?

                                     BRODY

                         He wanted a job, he's got one. I 

                         want to see that boat out of the 

                         water by tomorrow night.

               We see Sean's door opening as he peeps into the hall to see 

               what the fuss is about.

               ANGLE ON SEAN'S DOOR

               It opens a few inches, he looks out at the grownups and his 

               brother, decides he wants no part of this, and quietly closes 

               the door.

                                     MIKE (O.S.)

                         Dad, please...

                                     BRODY (O.S.)

                         Tomorrow night. Out of the water.

               ANGLE ON THE HALLWAY

               Mike silently storms into his room, not-so-silently slamming 

               the door as he exits. From inside the room, loud rock music 

               muffled behind the door -- an expression of teen-age 

               rebellion.

                                     ELLEN

                         Not so loud!

               The music lowers its volume. Brody turns to go into the 

               bedroom, to take his shoes off, to go to bed...

                                     BRODY

                         I know what you're going to say.

                                     ELLEN

                         Do you?

                                     BRODY

                              (on the bed)

                         In the city, it happened all the 

                         time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, 

                         top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under 

                         the Brooklyn local, old people die 

                         alone in shitty apartments and three 

                         weeks later someone calls the cops 

                         because of the smell and the flies.  

                         Call the cops. What are we, immune?

                                     ELLEN

                         It was bad, wasn't it.

                                     BRODY

                         The goddamn smell is always the same.

                              (he shudders at the 

                              recollection)

                                     ELLEN

                         Are you going to be able to sleep?

                                     BRODY

                         Yeah. I think so.

                              (he raises his voice)

                         Mike! Keep it down, for chrissake!

               Ellen gets up, and quietly closes the door. The upstairs 

               hallway is empty, the doors closed. The Brody household 

               compartmented and closed for the night.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. AMITY BEACH - DAY

               The familiar striped cabanas flank the white sands; there's 

               a crowd of midweek seasonal tourists and locals oblivious to 

               the tall steel tower that dominates the beach.

               A classy van outfitted for passengers pulls into the parking 

               area, followed by Vaughn's Cadillac; the parking attendant 

               waves them into a preferential area, where they disembark:

               Vaughn, Peterson, Ellen, and some more prospects, including 

               a woman named Bryant and her daughter, Renee.

                                     PETERSON

                         This is the town beach; the 

                         development naturally has its own 

                         private access, but I wanted you to 

                         see the concession area. Look at 

                         that sand -- like sugar!

               He scoops up a handful of the fine powder. Ellen directs the 

               attention of the photographers.

                                     ELLEN

                         During the summer, the sun sets right 

                         there...

                              (she points)

                         Over the water. Beautiful.

                                     VAUGHN

                              (to Ellen)

                         I'll say hello for you.

               Ellen nods, preoccupied. Vaughn strolls away, headed in the 

               direction of the cabanas. Mary Nichols, a local Selectwoman, 

               emerges from behind the counter of one of the concessions.

                                     NICHOLS

                         Hello -- selling some more of the 

                         good life?

                                     ELLEN

                         A piece here, a piece there, it all 

                         adds up.

                                     NICHOLS

                         Your husband's been here all morning. 

                         What's he doing?

                                     ELLEN

                              (good-naturedly)

                         His job.

               Michael Brody, dressed in township workman's coveralls, is 

               repainting some flaking woodwork. Sean is happily mixing 

               paint. Vaughn joins them.

                                     VAUGHN

                         Your dad got you working?

                                     MIKE

                         Yeah.

               He continues his chore, without enthusiasm.

                                     SEAN

                         I'm helping.

                                     VAUGHN

                         You know where your dad is?

                                     MIKE

                         Up there.

               He points at the tower.

                                     VAUGHN

                         Oh, for Christ's sake.

               He crosses briskly to where Peterson is finishing.

                                     PETERSON

                         And if you have any questions about 

                         recreational possibilities, Ellen 

                         Brody here will be happy to answer 

                         them.

                                     VAUGHN

                         Len, can I see you a minute?

               Peterson excuses himself and joins the Mayor.

                                     PETERSON

                         I think we got a couple of live ones.

                                     VAUGHN

                         Brody's riding his tower.

                                     PETERSON

                              (looking up)

                         Oh, shit.

               BRODY IN THE TOWER

               sweeping the water with binoculars, restless eyes trying to 

               scan everything, a grim watchman high over the heads of the 

               unseeing crowd.

               ON THE WATER

               Larry Vaughn, Jr. comes skimming in close to the surf. Bob 

               is handling the sheets, Larry is giving young Jackie sailing 

               lessons -- at the moment he's showing her how the tiller 

               works.  He's on her like glue.

                                     JACKIE

                         This is fun! Can we go faster?

                                     LARRY

                              (to Bob)

                         Trim.

               Bob does, Larry trims the main, and the hull lifts.

                                     JACKIE

                         Yay!

               She snuggles in Larry's arms. He waves to someone.

                                     LARRY

                         That's my dad!

               Jackie waves without seeing.

               ON THE BEACH

               Vaughn waves back, preoccupied. Near him, Mike Brody looks 

               up, his face grim, jealous, and now a little nuts. He splashes 

               paint onto the wood with angry abandon.

                                     VAUGHN

                              (to Peterson)

                         Wave to my son.

                                     PETERSON

                              (waving)

                         How the hell do we get him down from 

                         there?

                                     VAUGHN

                         Maybe nobody will notice. Let's get 

                         them back in the bus.

               Mrs. Bryant approaches them, tugging her daughter.

                                     MRS. BRYANT

                         Renee wants to know what that man is 

                         doing way up there?

                                     PETERSON

                         He's, ah, watching. A lookout.

                                     MRS. BRYANT

                         For what?

                                     RENEE

                              (a precocious little 

                              girl)

                         It's a shark tower. I saw one in 

                         Florida. He's looking for sharks.

                                     VAUGHN

                         It's an observation platform. That's 

                         our Chief of Police. He's just 

                         checking it.

                                     PETERSON

                         Normally, it's used for, ah, bird 

                         watching. Nature observation. Weather 

                         measurements, that sort of thing.

                              (a little desperate)

                         Ellen, we're running late!

                                     ELLEN

                         Okay. Folks, if we could get back 

                         on, we'll show you the country club, 

                         and stop for lunch...

               At the mention of lunch, the prospects, all hungry, begin 

               flocking back into the van. Peterson herds them along.

                                     PETERSON

                         The country club has an 18-hole 

                         course, putting greens, and twelve 

                         tennis courts...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BRODY IN THE TOWER

               still scanning. His body suddenly tenses. There's something 

               out there. He mashes his binoculars to his eyes, trying to 

               get a better look.

               HIS POINT OF VIEW (PROCESS)

               Through the binoculars, something big and black, moving under 

               the buoys and into the swimming area.

               BRODY AGAIN

               He can't believe it. But looking past him, we can see it 

               with the unaided eye: a seething dark mass, moving through 

               the water towards the unprotected bathers.

                                     BRODY

                              (screaming)

                         Out of the water! Everyone out of 

                         the water!

               No one can hear him. A few little faces look up, unable to 

               catch what he's saying. He starts climbing down the ladder 

               shouting.

                                     BRODY

                         Get out of the water! Tell everyone 

                         to get out! Now! Out of the water!

               ANGLE ON PETERSON, VAUGHN, AND NICHOLS

               reacting.

                                     VAUGHN

                              (recalling another 

                              panic)

                         Oh, my God...

                                     PETERSON

                         What the hell is he doing?

                                     NICHOLS

                         Oh, no!

               ELLEN, MIKE, AND SEAN

               Looking up, startled at Brody's sudden panic.

               THE WATER

               The dark mass almost on top of the swimmers, who are starting 

               to look around. Most of them are oblivious to what's happening 

               on shore.

               FOLLOW BRODY

               as his feet hit the sand and he starts running for the water, 

               fumbling for his gun and the speed-loader with the cyanide 

               bullets. He is bumping into people, knocking little kids 

               over, stepping on blankets and umbrellas, a madman.

                                     BRODY

                         Out of the water! Now! Everyone!

               VAUGHN

               Running too, half-stumbling, half-believing, remembering...

               ELLEN

               Moving after her husband, while Mike steadies Sean, holding 

               the impulsive kid back.

                                     ELLEN

                              (seeing something)

                         Martin! No!

               ANGLE ON BRODY AGAIN

               The gun is out now, he's trying draw a bead on the shape in 

               the water; chest heaving, he tries to steady his shaky grip. 

               People see the gun and scream, throwing themselves flat on 

               the sand, running, some of them going into the water.

                                     BRODY

                         No! Don't go in! Stay out! Stay clear!

               He fires. Again. Bullets ricochet off the water, howling 

               towards the horizon. Real panic now. Four more shots.

               Reloading, ejected rounds falling bright into the sand, Brody 

               on his knees, fumbling with bullets.

               ANGLE ON A LIFEGUARD

               standing on his platform, shocked, watching the Chief of 

               Police fumbling with his gun.

                                     LIFEGUARD

                         It's bluefish! It's a school of 

                         bluefish! Chief! It's bluefish!

               ANGLE ON THE WATER

               It is bluefish -- a tight mass of them, churning up the water 

               in a dark, dense group. The swimmers look around, confused 

               by the shots and excitement.

                                     A SWIMMER

                         What's going on?

                                     ANOTHER SWIMMER

                         Fish! Anyone got a net?

                                     3RD SWIMMER

                         Someone get me a rod and reel!

               Laughter defuses the tension in the water; bathers move 

               around, some getting closer to see the fish, others leaving 

               the water to join friends and families on the sand.

               ANGLE ON THE BEACH

               where Brody is now standing, panting, coming down as a crowd 

               collects at a safe distance around him: Ellen emerges from a 

               group that includes Vaughn, Peterson, and Nichols.

                                     BRODY

                         Sorry. I'm sorry. False alarm...

               Curious crowd murmurs as they watch this lunacy. Brody 

               realizes he's fired his weapon, that spent shells litter the 

               sand at his feet.

                                     BRODY

                         Okay, it's all over, go on, it's 

                         over. No trouble...

               Ellen joins him.

                                     ELLEN

                         It's okay. It's over...

               Brody drops to his knees, fumbling for the cyanide bullets 

               in his gun, trying to put things in order, scrabbling in the 

               sand for the empty shells.

               The crowd is curious and embarrassed. Some turn away, others

               drift back to their blankets, talking about what's just 

               happened, others stare rudely. Brody is coming apart.

                                     BRODY

                         It's all right, everything's all 

                         right...

               Sean emerges from the crowd, and helps his daddy pick up the 

               bullets, Ellen moves to disperse the rudely curious.

                                     ELLEN (O.S.)

                         Let's go, everyone... Mrs. Bryant, 

                         Len, please...

               CLOSE ON BRODY AND SEAN

               He sees Sean, his eyes fill with tears, and he grabs the kid 

               in a fierce hug.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. TOWN HALL - DAY

               A hurriedly called meeting of the town's Selectmen is in 

               session: Vaughn, Peterson, and three others: Kaiser, an old 

               man still in his grocery clerk's apron; Sansom; and Nichols, 

               the woman on the beach.

                                     VAUGHN

                         Brody's a good man.

                                     KAISER

                         Nobody says he isn't.

                                     PETERSON

                         You should've been out there. You 

                         should've seen him waving that gun, 

                         like a maniac. There were shots fired!

                                     VAUGHN

                         He thought he had a good reason.

                                     MS. NICHOLS

                         But that's not rational behavior!

                                     PETERSON

                         That's what I'm saying!

                                     VAUGHN

                         How many people were there?

                                     MS. NICHOLS

                         Hundred! Literally hundreds. What 

                         are they going to say about us?

                                     PETERSON

                              (to Vaughn)

                         Larry, I'm a businessman, trying to 

                         make a buck like anybody else.

                                     VAUGHN

                         So? So?

                                     PETERSON

                         So it can't be done like that. The 

                         man's a menace, plain and simple.

                                     VAUGHN

                         Look, what am I supposed to do? It's 

                         done, it's over. We have to deal 

                         with the consequences.

                                     SANSOM

                         That's what we're here to do.

                                     VAUGHN

                         All right. Let's go into my office, 

                         where we can have a little privacy.

               ANGLE FROM INSIDE VAUGHN'S OFFICE

               as the selectmen troop into the cramped quarters. Vaughn 

               deliberately closes the door as they find seats around the 

               room.

                                     VAUGHN

                         I believe we have a quorum, and 

                         informally, I suggest we call this 

                         meeting an executive session and 

                         dispense with minutes...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BRODY'S OFFICE - DAY

               Brody, alone, is sitting at his desk, morosely studying a 

               little gold statuette of a pistol marksman. What's done is 

               done, and Brody is trying to figure out how to live with it. 

               The phone rings, is answered in the other room. The buzzer 

               sounds. Brody picks up his end.

                                     BRODY

                         Polly, no calls, please...

                              (she insists)

                         Okay, okay.

                              (he punches a button)

                         Hello... Phil? Fogarty? What 

                         pictures... I'll be right down...

               He slams down the phone and gets up to go, suddenly possessed 

               with a purpose.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DARKROOM - DAY

               Amid the equipment, clutter and proofs, some shots of the 

               holidome opening, drying on wires. Phil Fogarty, the indignant 

               fat man and town photographer, is locking the door behind an 

               impatient Brody.

                                     PHIL

                         I don't know what you did, but that 

                         kid stopped. I haven't heard one 

                         peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for 

                         days. Believe me, it's a pleasure...

                                     BRODY

                         You said something about a camera.

                                     PHIL

                         Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought 

                         in this camera, see, from underwater, 

                         and I didn't know how to get it open, 

                         but my brother-in-law, in Montauk, 

                         he works at a hi-fi store, and they 

                         sell cameras, so he...

                                     BRODY

                              (interrupting)

                         Did you get any pictures?

                                     PHIL

                         Well, yeah, I did, that's the funny 

                         thing. You can't tell much from the 

                         negatives, I was going to blow 'em 

                         up. Here's a test I did...

               He holds out an 8 x 10 proof, Brody snatches it from him.

               Brody stares down at it. Sure enough, the ghostly outlines 

               of the Orca, underwater, a diver on the deck making a gesture 

               at the camera.

                                     BRODY (O.S.)

                         Oh, Jesus. That boat...

                         Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, 

                         probably 1.4. Look at the diffusion, 

                         though...

                                     BRODY

                         What else you got?

                                     PHIL

                         Let's see -- you got a minute?

                                     BRODY

                         Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.

                                     PHIL

                         Okay, okay -- stand over there...

               He gestures, Brody steps to one side of a table with some 

               big enamel pans for washing and developing prints. Phil 

               switches to a red light, and takes some printing paper, 

               putting it under the enlarger.

               QUICK CUTS:

               --  Enlarger light going on.

               --  Timer ticking, the hand turning.

               --  Quick negative images: water, boat, diver, hand, boat 

               again, tantalizing fragments of the opening sequence projected 

               on the enlarger's flat base.

               --  Hypo and Developer sloshing in a pan under Phil's hands.

               --  Brody staring down.

               INSERT (PROCESS)

               Quietly gaining contrast in a pan of developer, a print of 

               what at first looks like seaweed, then is unmistakably the 

               grinning jaws of the Great White.

               SUBLIMINAL FLASH CUT - SHARK

               A quick nightmare vision of Brody, alone in a sinking Orca, 

               trapped in a battered cabin interior; a Great White crashes 

               through the glass, its head huge as it lunges.

               INSERT PHOTOGRAPH IN DEVELOPER (PROCESS)

               The close-up detail of this otherwise blurred and unreadable 

               photo is unmistakably a detail from a very close view of the 

               snapping jaws of a Great White; if you hadn't seen it as a 

               memory, it would make no sense at all. For Brody, the meaning 

               is all too clear; for anyone who's never seen the monster 

               face-to-face, it's nothing.

                                     BRODY (O.S.)

                              (shaken)

                         That one there. That one...

               Phil's hands, holding plastic tongs, gently slosh the print 

               in the bath. The shark's features are indistinguishable from 

               the surrounding detail.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. TOWN HALL - NIGHT

               Brody walks into view, and starts up the steps into the town 

               hall, already lit from within. He's carrying a large envelope.

               INT. TOWN HALL - NIGHT

               The Selectmen (Kaiser, Sansom, Nichols), Len Peterson, and 

               Vaughn are seated informally around the big table.

               Brody enters, carrying the envelope with the photo.

                                     BRODY

                         Thank God you guys were all together. 

                         I got something for you. Proof!

                                     VAUGHN

                         Martin, this is kind of an official 

                         meeting

                                     BRODY

                         Perfect. Look at this ---

               He fumbles with the envelope.

                                     VAUGHN

                         Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has 

                         a question only you can answer.

                                     BRODY

                              (preoccupied)

                         What?

                                     PETERSON

                         Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill 

                         in as an interim Chief of Police in 

                         your absence?

                                     BRODY

                         Temporarily? Uh... sure... The 

                         question's out of left field. Why 

                         are they asking?

                                     NICHOLS

                         So Jeff could handle things? He knows 

                         the routine, he has the authority?

                                     BRODY

                         Yeah. Why?

                                     PETERSON

                         It came up during the meeting.

                                     BRODY

                         Look -- I just got this from Phil 

                         Fogarty. It was in the camera 

                         belonging to the missing divers. It 

                         proves I was right, all along.

               He throws the picture down in front of them. They bend over 

               to study it, pass it around, look at it.

                         KAISER

                 Seaweed?

                                               It's underwater, isn't it? That's 

                                               why it's so dark.

                                     SANSOM

                         I don't know -- what is it?

                                     BRODY

                         It's a shark! A Great White! Jesus, 

                         it's right there!

               He snatches up the photo.

               INSERT PHOTO

               Just as before, an ambiguous pattern of light and dark; not 

               proof of anything without Brody's inner vision.

                         It's nothing I can see.

               waving the picture.

                                     BRODY

                         What are you all, blind? It's a shark. 

                         Look -- teeth, jaw, gills.

                                     PETERSON

                         Is that what it is?

                                     BRODY

                         You're damn right that's what it is.

                                     NICHOLS

                         I'm sorry, I just don't see it.

               Sansom and Kaiser agree, ad lib, "That's nothing..."

                                     VAUGHN

                         Martin, it could be anything.

                                     BRODY

                              (exploding)

                         What the hell does it take to make 

                         sense to you numbskulls? Jesus, it's 

                         right there in front of you. I know 

                         what a goddamn shark looks like, 

                         I've been through it, don't you 

                         understand? I've seen this sonofabitch 

                         before!

               The Selectmen look at each other in the face of Brody's 

               agitation. Tempers are running high.

                                     PETERSON

                         What have you seen before? This is 

                         nothing. Seaweed. Mud. Something in 

                         the lens.

                                     BRODY

                         Be reasonable, please...

                                     PETERSON

                              (to Vaughn)

                         Forget it, he won't listen.

                                     BRODY

                         There is nothing to discuss.

                                     PETERSON

                              (blowing up)

                         Will you listen to this man? Will 

                         you just listen to him?

                              (to Brody)

                         You really caused a panic on a public 

                         beach, you shoot up the place, God 

                         knows who could've been injured -- 

                         what if somebody decides to sue us? 

                         That could ruin us.

                                     BRODY

                         Is that what it is? Dollars? Money? 

                         I'll pay for it. Take it out of my 

                         salary.

                                     PETERSON

                         You don't make enough.

                                     BRODY

                         Maybe I don't make as much money as 

                         some bullshit rip-off artists around 

                         here, but I don't work the same way.

                                     PETERSON

                         What's that supposed to mean?

                                     BRODY

                         It means I don't like all that grab-

                         ass and heavy breathing with my wife, 

                         it means I know who's out to screw 

                         me here, and it means that I know 

                         something none of you know because 

                         I've been there -- and I don't want 

                         to go through that horror again. 

                         Ever!

               There's a long pause.

                                     VAUGHN

                         Martin, could you wait here for a 

                         few minutes while we make up our 

                         minds about something?

                         Go ahead, whatever it's worth.

               The Selectmen file into Vaughn's office, leaving Brody alone 

               in the room. The last one in the door very carefully makes 

               sure it's tightly shut.

               Brody sits alone at the table.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Very well then. It is moved and

                         of his duties as Chief of Police, 

                         his contract with the township be

                         Anyone opposed, or is it unanimous?

               Vaughn's hand goes up, the sole dissent. They stare at him.

                         I'm sorry, but I respect his 

                         convictions. The motion is carried.

               He goes to the door, and opens it.

               The police jeep pulls up and stops; although the engine's 

               shut down, Brody still sits quietly inside the car. Then his 

               hand appears at the window, and he drops an empty beer can 

               onto the lawn. Clink.

               After a while, he drops another beer can, then another, until 

               the "clinks" tell us he's polished off a six-pack on the way 

               home. Not too steady on his feet, Brody climbs out of the 

               car and starts for the door to his house.

               Ellen is working at her desk in the den. She is looking 

               towards the door, expectantly -- it's been an unusually long 

               pause between car arrival and husband arrival. Brody enters.

                                     ELLEN

                         Hi. I closed a sale today, without 

                         Len. That's $1200 commission, if the 

                         papers go through.

                                     BRODY

                         That's great.

                                     ELLEN

                         Sean's asleep.

                                     BRODY

                         That's great too. Gorgeous.

               He takes a long look at her.

                                     BRODY

                         You look about 22 years old sitting 

                         there. Like you were doing homework...

               He goes to join her, bumping into some furniture in the dimly 

               lit room. Ellen has a beer and sandwich half-finished on her 

               desk; Brody takes a healthy swallow from the beer.

                                     ELLEN

                              (sensitive)

                         What's wrong?

                                     BRODY

                         Ooohh, nothing. I just got fired, 

                         that's all.

               He tosses the photo sloppily on the desk.

                                     ELLEN

                         What?

                                     BRODY

                         What'd I say?

                                     ELLEN

                         That you were fired.

                                     BRODY

                         Then that's what I meant. Fired. 

                         Canned. Out on my fanny. The Selectmen 

                         just made Hendricks the new Chief of 

                         Police. Just like that.

                                     ELLEN

                         Because of today? The beach?

                                     BRODY

                              (expansively)

                         No sweat. A blessing in disguise. 

                         Back to the city, you can go to 

                         Bloomingdale's without waiting six 

                         hours for the ferryboat... we're 

                         surrounded by water here, you realize 

                         that? Me, surrounded by water... 

                         Ridiculous.

                                     ELLEN

                         Stop that! We're not going any place. 

                         You love it here. Tell me what the 

                         hell happened!

                                     BRODY

                         Showed them the photo, showed them 

                         the goddamn Shark, big as life. They 

                         didn't see it. Not like me. Not like 

                         the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped 

                         this li'l picture... He's out there, 

                         somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot 

                         off my big mouth, so they fired me...

                                     ELLEN

                              (studying the photo)

                         Honey, this is nothing... I don't 

                         know what it is. What did they...

                                     BRODY

                              (going on)

                         ...Everybody wants the job. No one 

                         wants the authority. Except Hendricks. 

                         Fine. He can go out there in that 

                         precious boat, and when he looks 

                         whitey in his big mouth he can just 

                         call me. Call me in New York... tell 

                         him to kiss my ass...

                                     ELLEN

                              (seeing his pain)

                         They have no right to treat you like 

                         that. You've given them everything. 

                         For four years, you've protected 

                         this town, the people on this 

                         island...

                                     BRODY

                         Fired me!

                              (at Ellen)

                         I'm not a hysterical man. I'm 

                         responsible. I know what I saw...

                                     ELLEN

                         I know you did...

                                     BRODY

                         I try. Goddamnit, I tried... Now, 

                         I'm tired... I can't keep fighting 

                         it... I'm too tired... I'm... I'm...

               Brody's slipping under; the beers and the day have finally 

               overcome him. He slumps in Ellen's arms.

                                     ELLEN

                         You're drunk is what you are...

               She eases him onto the couch, tucking a comforter over his 

               inert shape.

                                     ELLEN

                         Take it easy... Easy...

               ANGLE ON THE STAIRWELL

               Sean comes down the stairs, sleepy, in his pajamas.

                                     SEAN

                         Is dad home? I heard something...

               He comes into the darkened den.

               ELLEN AND SEAN

                                     ELLEN

                         Shhhh. Go back upstairs. Daddy's 

                         sleeping.

               Sean finds the photo, and stares at it idly.

                                     SEAN

                         What's this?

                                     ELLEN

                         Nothing, sweetheart. Seaweed.

               She takes him by his sleepy hand and leads him out of the 

               room, leaving Brody tucked in on the couch, dead to the world.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NEWSSTORE - NIGHT

               This is the Amity teen-ager's hangout -- a newsstand and 

               pinball arcade with a minimal refreshment counter where soft 

               drinks and submarine sandwiches are dispensed. A jukebox is 

               blaring some n.d. rock music. Present are Donnie, Doug, Timmy, 

               Bob, Larry Vaughn Jr., Brooke, Marge, Denise, Jane, Andy, 

               and Mike. The boys are passing around hot-rod van and custom 

               boat magazines; the girls are looking at Silver Screen, Tiger 

               Beat, People, and Time. Andy and Mike are at the counter, 

               splitting a sandwich.

                                     DOUG

                              (holding a book)

                         That's what I want -- a gaff rig.

                                     TIMMY

                         Gaff rigged? Why not a staysail 

                         schooner? Go anywhere. Look at this -- 

                         the Mayan, an Alden schooner.

                                     BOB

                         Hey, Mike -- I saw your dad over at 

                         the town hall.

                                     MIKE

                         I know.

                                     DOUG

                              (innocently)

                         Did he really freak out at the beach?

                                     MIKE

                         I don't know.

                                     ANDY

                         Hey, it's all bullshit. Anyone want 

                         to play pong for money?

               No one does. There's a bustle at the door, and some couples 

               enter from the movies: Patrick and Lucy, Ed and Tina, Polo 

               and Jackie. There are a lot of ad-lib greetings;

                         How was the show?

                         It was okay.

                                     PATRICK

                         I'd rather go the lighthouse.

                                     POLO

                         Anyone want to go the lighthouse?

                         Nah. Tomorrow. Early, spend the day. 

                         My folks left two cases of beer in 

                         the garage.

                                     PATRICK

                         Is it still there?

                                     POLO

                         Nope. Got it in my boat.

                                     LUCY

                         All-right.

                                     JACKIE

                         Let's go for it.

               There's a general ad-lib agreement to organize a day's sailing 

               picnic.

                                     TINA

                         Mike, you going?

                                     MIKE

                         Why shouldn't I?

                                     LARRY

                         I thought you might still be painting 

                         the restrooms at the beach.

               Laughter from the gang.

                         Anyone want a coke or anything?

               They break up into pairs and trios, some going for the soda 

               fountain, others hanging out by the magazines.

               ANGLE ON JACKIE AND MIKE

                                     JACKIE

                         I'd like to go out to the lighthouse 

                         with you.

                                     MIKE

                         I'm not sure I can.

                                     JACKIE

                                     MIKE

                         Maybe you and Brooke could come over 

                         to the town beach...

                                     JACKIE

                         No way. Everybody's going sailing. 

                         If you don't want to take me, just 

                         say so.

                                     MIKE

                         That's not it. My dad told me not to 

                         go.

                                     JACKIE

                         You do everything your parents tell 

                         you?

                                     MIKE

                         No.

                         Good. I'll be on the dock at eight.

                              (to the gang)

                         Eight o'clock, everybody!

               They ad lib agreement.

                              (aside to Mike)

                         I really want to to be there.

                         Who's bringing the wine? And who's 

                         got a quarter for the box?

               Brooke takes Mike aside, as Jackie goes to the jukebox.

               Larry is right there with a quarter, standing next to her as 

               they select a tune.

               INT. BRODY BEDROOM - DAY

               Ellen is asleep under the covers, Brody, still in his clothes 

               from the night before, is sprawled on top; obviously he's 

               stumbled upstairs sometime during the night. There's a noise 

               down the hall, from Mike's room. Brody stirs, but doesn't 

               wake up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MIKE'S ROOM - DAY

               Mike is holding a lamp that's almost fallen -- the noise we 

               just heard. He's almost dressed, but not quite satisfied 

               with his image in the mirror. He takes off his clean shirt, 

               and checks a more comfortable, worn shirt. A brief sniff to 

               make sure it's okay for another day, and he puts it on; he 

               tiptoes to the hall, where a noise stops him in his tracks.

               INT. BRODY HALLWAY - DAY

               Mike is frozen in his part-opened bedroom door. Sean's door 

               opens, and little Sean, also fully dressed, comes sneaking 

               out.

                                     SEAN

                              (whispering)

                         You're going out.

                                     MIKE

                         Yeah.

                                     SEAN

                         You're going sailing.

                                     MIKE

                         Maybe.

                                     SEAN

                         Take me.

                                     MIKE

                         No.

                                     SEAN

                              (louder)

                         I want to go with you!

                                     MIKE

                         Quiet!  Shhh!

                                     SEAN

                              (even louder)

                         Michael...

                                     MIKE

                         Okay, okay. Close your door.

               Sean does, and happily tiptoes with exaggerated stealth to 

               Mike; the two of them start downstairs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BRODY HOUSE

               Michael and Sean are walking away towards the road into town.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BRODY UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

               Brody emerges from the bathroom, dressed in sweatshirt, and 

               cutoffs: no uniform today. He starts downstairs, stopping 

               only to look into Mike's room. It's empty.

                                     BRODY

                         Good morning, America...

               A grin crosses his face -- "My son, the Don Juan..." He goes 

               downstairs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BRODY KITCHEN - DAY

               Brody enters from upstairs. He heats coffee. Ellen enters 

               dressed for work. He pours two cups.

                                     ELLEN

                         What're you going to do today?

                                     BRODY

                         Turn in the car. Clean my desk, 

                         explain things to our sons, then 

                         maybe get shit-faced and punch your 

                         boss.

                                     ELLEN

                         I'll give notice.

                                     BRODY

                         Don't rush into it -- we may need 

                         the income.

               She pours the coffee, they drink it for a moment.

                                     BRODY

                         Mike left early. Couldn't wait to 

                         make out. Must be a morning man.

               Ellen and Brody sip their coffee quietly for a few moments.

               Mrs. Silvera arrives, carrying groceries.

                                     MRS. SILVERA

                         Morning. Anything special today?

                         ELLEN

                 Sean's not up yet. You 

                 know what he likes, 

                 just some Fruit Loops 

                 and milk. No candy.

                                                       BRODY

                                               The sink upstairs is busted. 

                                               Try some Drano, or a 

                                               plunger, maybe. Or call 

                                               your brother, the plumber, 

                                               what's his name...

                                     MRS. SILVERA

                         Frankie. He's my cousin.

                                     BRODY

                         Frankie. Okay. Ask him if he needs 

                         an apprentice.

               Brody and Ellen are at the door.

                                     MRS. SILVERA

                         Have a nice day.

               They leave.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DOCKSIDE - DAY

               The Kids are into their boats, fitting out for a day of 

               recreational offshore sailing. Mike and Andy are readying 

               his Tornado, while Sean gets in the way. In the b.g., 

               Hendricks can be seen puttering around on the Amity police 

               boat.

                                     ANDY

                         If you're beached, why are we doing 

                         this? For practice?

                                     MIKE

                         Yeah.

                                     ANDY

                         Then why are we futzing around the 

                         dock? We can make a few bucks working 

                         at the beach.

               Sean knocks something over, Mike snaps at him.

                                     MIKE

                         Look -- if you're going to get in 

                         the way, you can just go home.

                                     SEAN

                         I'm not in the way. Andy, am I in 

                         the way?

                                     ANDY

                         You're always in the way.

               Marge joins them, scooping Sean up.

                                     MARGE

                         This guy giving you any trouble?

                                     SEAN

                         Put me down!

                                     ANDY

                         Put him down in the water.

                                     MARGE

                              (to Sean)

                         You want to go out in my boat?

                                     SEAN

                         Yeah.

                                     MIKE

                         Would you take him?

                                     MARGE

                         Sure.

                                     ANDY

                         You've just made someone very happy.

               Marge and Sean go over to her Lightening. Brooke and Jackie 

               come down the dock, dressed for sailing.

                                     BROOKE

                         Mike! Are you going out?

                                     MIKE

                         Maybe.

                                     JACKIE

                         I thought you were grounded.

                                     MIKE

                         I can go out if I want to.

                                     ANDY

                         You can?

                                     JACKIE

                         You going to the lighthouse?

                                     MIKE

                         Why not?

                                     ANDY

                         I could give you a dozen good reasons.

                                     MIKE

                              (to Andy)

                         Shut up.

                                     ANDY

                         Okay, okay, don't say I didn't remind 

                         you.

                                     JACKIE

                         Is there room on your boat for all 

                         of us?

               Mike looks: Andy, Jackie, Brooke, himself... Timmy moves in, 

               sensing the chance of a lifetime.

                                     ANDY

                         Well, we're pretty crowded, and I 

                         don't know when we're leaving...

               Timmy makes his move.

                                     TIMMY

                         I've got room.

                                     BROOKE

                         Great.

                              (to Andy)

                         That's okay -- I'll go with Timmy.

                                     TIMMY

                         You will?

                                     BROOKE

                         Sure.

               And she walks towards his boat, looking back for him to 

               follow. He's dumbstruck by his sudden good fortune.

                                     TIMMY

                         Fan-tas-tic!

               He runs to join her, untying mooring lines like crazy; they're 

               together again at last for the first time. Andy is left 

               shuffling with Mike and Jackie.

                                     JACKIE

                         I'm ready.

               And she plops down in Mike's boat, ready to be taken. 

               Anywhere.

                                     JACKIE

                         Come on, you guys.

                                     ANDY

                         Well, I don't know...

               Jackie flashes him one of her pouty little smiles. Why break 

               one heart when you can break two? Or more?

                                     JACKIE

                         Please come with us?

               Mike is glaring. The message is clear, if unspoken.

                                     JACKIE

                         For me...?

                                     ANDY

                         What the hell. For you...

               Andy joins them.  Mike casts off, while Andy helps, and Jackie 

               sits there, looking cute.

               ANGLE ON LARRY AND BOB

               watching what's going on.

                                     BOB

                         I thought you said she was going 

                         with us?

                                     LARRY

                         Let's just go sailing, okay?

                                     BOB

                              (casting off)

                         Want to talk about it?

                                     LARRY

                         Want to swim home?

               Bob gets the message and shuts up. The Sizzler fills its 

               sails, and points out of the harbor.

               WIDE ON THE HARBOR

               Lots of day-sailing Kids, a few bigger, adult boats, some 

               working fishermen and sport fishers; a typical recreational 

               boating mix. The Kids are finding the same general direction, 

               pointing out of the harbor.

               QUICK CUTS

               -- Sails being trimmed.

               --  Brooke and Timmy, staring into each other's eyes as he 

               sets a course straight for the lighthouse.

               --  Larry, lifting a hull, almost losing Bob.

               EXT. HARBOR MOUTH - DAY

               The Kids' boats, in a loose bunch, slipping out to sea.

               REVERSE - LOOKING OUT TO SEA

               The dive class boat, isolated near the channel, a group of 

               Kids in wet suits and tanks assembled with three adult 

               instructors: Tom Andrews, Crosby, and Sparky.

               EXT. DIVING BOAT - DAY

               Andrews and his assistant instructor, Sparky, are addressing 

               the class, when Mike and Andy's "Green Machine" sails by, 

               close.

                                     ANDREWS

                         Hey! Nicholas! You're supposed to be 

                         in class!

                                     ANDY

                         Today I'm staying topside. You dive 

                         for me!

                                     ANDREWS

                         I'm going for lobster.

                                     JACKIE

                         Great! Find one for me.

                                     ANDY

                         With butter, if they got any...

               Andrews dismisses them with a good-natured wave.

                                     ANDREWS

                         So long, turkies.

               He turns to his class.

                                     ANDREWS

                         Sparky will take you down today. If 

                         everyone's got a buddy, we'll drop.

               The class dutifully lines up and starts going in, while in 

               the b.g. the Kids sailboats head out to sea. Andrews' two 

               partners, Crosby and Sparky, get ready to follow the class 

               over.

                                     CROSBY

                              (to Andrews)

                         Let's get some dinner.

               He goes over, Andrews following. Sparky is with the class, 

               signaling "Down;" they submerge like clumsy seals.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               UNDERWATER

               The class, paired up, is drifting down; Sparky offering 

               encouragement as they descend. Andrews and Crosby are already 

               disappearing, swimming away with strong kicks.

               FOLLOWING ANDREWS AND CROSBY

               as they go over the edge of a shelf and drop into darker, 

               deeper waters. Crosby checks his depth, his watch, looks 

               around...

               HIS POINT OF VIEW

               far above him, the class, going about their business.

               Below him, murk, depth, and suddenly, a big lunker bass.

               Andrews sees it, too.

               ANGLE - ON ANDREWS

               Assuming Crosby is following, he takes off, following the 

               big lunker. Crosby, hung up in some minor equipment problem, 

               misses seeing him go. The two men are separated. Follow 

               Andrews as he twists and turns after the bass, going deeper, 

               losing him in the rocks, suddenly rounding a boulder, and 

               meeting, almost face-to-face, horror:

               BELOW HIM THE SHARK

               The Great White Shark, taking the striper in a single gulp, 

               it's looking up at Andrews with one glassy doll's eye; it 

               turns to face him directly, and we see the scar; ugly, red 

               and black, charred flesh from jaw back on the right side, 

               eyes and teeth gleaming like raw bone in the massive, uncaring 

               face.

               Andrews' mouth clamps violently on his mouthpiece, then goes 

               wide as he screams in fear into the water. Finning backwards, 

               he ditches his weights, gulps for air, and yanks the cord on 

               his safety vest. It balloons out, and pulls him up, surging 

               towards the surface. The mouthpiece, useless, falls away 

               from his lips.

               Eyes closed, hose dangling, Andrews hurtles upward, holding 

               his breath in a final, fatal panic, passing a startled Crosby.

               THE DIVERS

               look over at the rocketing ascent. What's wrong? Sparky 

               signals "up," and they begin to carefully follow him towards 

               the surface. Crosby's already surfacing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DECK OF THE DIVING BOAT - DAY

               Andrews is on his side, bloody froth on his lips. One of the 

               class is clinging to his legs, trying to arrest his 

               convulsions. Sparky is holding his shoulders, trying to 

               administer mouth-to-mouth.

                                     SPARKY

                         Get us in! For Christ's sake, get us 

                         in!

               In his arms, Andrews writhes, pain knotting his limbs.

               Behind them, in the water, the fin surfaces, and casually 

               turns towards... the ocean. The Shark is headed for the sea. 

               And for the now distant Kids in their sailboats, dotting the 

               horizon in their familiar bright colors.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OCEAN - ED AND TINA'S SANDPIPER - DAY

               They are alone. In the middle distance, the rest of the Kids' 

               sails can be seen, headed for the lighthouse in the distance. 

               The Sandpiper's sails are luffing, they're making no headway.

                                     TINA

                         You want to tack, or just leave her 

                         pointed up like this?

                                     ED

                              (snuggling close)

                         Just like this.

                                     TINA

                         What about sailing?

                                     ED

                         The tide's running. It'll take us to 

                         the light.

                                     TINA

                         It'll take us to Budapest if you're 

                         not careful.

               Ed is lashing the rudder as they continue to drift with the 

               current.

                                     ED

                         First things first.

               He fumbles in a cooler chest, produces a bottle of wine.

                                     TINA

                         What about the others?

                                     ED

                         They'll be there when we get there. 

                         Might even have a fire started.

                                     TINA

                         What're we going to do in the mean 

                         time?

                                     ED

                         I dunno. We'll think of something.

               He pours the wine into the two paper cups.

                                     ED

                         But first, a little juice...

                                     TINA

                         And second?

                                     ED

                              (kissing her)

                         Mmmmmm.

                                     TINA

                              (resisting)

                         Wait a minute. Promise me something.

                                     ED

                         Anything. Anything.

                                     TINA

                         That you'll put down a blanket. I've 

                         got black and blue marks all over my 

                         butt, and my Mom's getting uptight 

                         about them.

                                     ED

                         You got it.

               And he fumbles for a blanket in a locker, thumping and banging 

               gear around as he rummages for it. Tina sips wine contentedly, 

               satisfied to wait.

               UNDERWATER

               The Sandpiper's hull, alone above us, as the Shark rises 

               with dreadful certainty, attracted by the erratic sounds of 

               Ed's hasty search.

               ANGLE ON TINA - WATCHING THE OCEAN

               The terrible fin breaks the surface, about 20 yards out, 

               then dips and disappears. Then, impossibly fast, the entire 

               Sandpiper is lifted from underneath by a powerful surge, as 

               the Shark lunges up against it from below, an unseen horror.

               Ed is knocked over the side, into the water.

               ANGLE ON ED

               as he breaks the surface, shaking the hair out of his eyes, 

               trying to orient himself, finding the boat. He starts to 

               swim for it, Tina extending an arm to help him climb aboard.

               ANGLE OVER THE GUNWALE, TOWARDS ED

               He has barely taken two strokes when a powerful force takes 

               him from below the surface, rushing him towards us through 

               the water. Tina screams. Before Ed can react to the pain, he 

               is slammed face first into the boat. His jaw breaks, blood 

               smears his nose and lip.

               His hands grab the wooden-cap rail with a death-grip.

               REVERSE

               Tina is staring down at the water, terror-stricken; Ed's 

               arms and head are f.g., as he locks onto the boat with 

               desperate hands.

               INSERT

               Ed's hands on the rail, knuckles white, an iron grip. With 

               awful finality, the force pulls down, and the wood shatters 

               and splits away as Ed's hands are pulled down and under by 

               the awful force.

               TINA

               her mouth working silently, unable to scream, staring down 

               at the blood and froth on the water, swirling in a grim eddy 

               under her, the Sandpiper rocking gently in the diminishing 

               swell.

               EXT. OCEAN - DAY - ESTABLISHING SHOT

               On the way to the lighthouse, but away from the harbor, the 

               Kids are sailing in fairly close order: The sloops (Polo, 

               Timmy, Marge) heeled well over in the stiff breeze, the faster 

               cats (Mike, Larry, Donny, etc.) skimming around, tacking 

               more often, faster and more maneuverable.

               CLOSE ON PATRICK AND LUCY

                                     LUCY

                         Faster! Faster!

                                     PATRICK

                         Coming about...

               She ducks under the boom, handling the jib sheets with easy 

               familiarity. They come about and scoot off on a new tack.

               CLOSE ON POLO

               Reading the wind, trimming sail expertly, competent and alone.

                                     POLO

                              (to a near-by boat)

                         Great day! I think the wind's going 

                         to change...

               CLOSE ON TIMMY AND BROOKE

               He comes about, she slides into him, he holds her to steady 

               her, she snuggles into his arms. True love, at last... He's 

               thrilled.

               CLOSE ON DOUG

               In his inflatable, poking slowly along. Marge passes him, 

               Sean hooting with glee.

                                     MARGE

                         Coming up.

                                     SEAN

                         Slowpoke! Slowpoke! Marge is faster!

                                     DOUG

                         I'm getting new sails, then watch 

                         out. Just a question of modifying 

                         the rigging!

               ANGLE ON MIKE'S "GREEN MACHINE"

               Jackie, Mike and Andy, clipping along, Larry Vaughn and Bob 

               in the Sizzler nearby. Mike lifts the hull, Jackie squeals 

               in delight.

                                     JACKIE

                         Wheee! Faster!

                                     ANDY

                         How fast is enough?

                                     JACKIE

                         I want to go faster!

                                     MIKE

                         Hang on...

               He trims his sheets, the cat heels more, one hull flying, 

               Andy and Jackie clinging to the trampoline.

               ANGLE ON THE SIZZLER

               Larry is carefully adjusting his tiller, Bob senses what 

               he's doing.

                                     BOB

                         You coming up on him?

                                     LARRY

                         You bet. Hang on...

               They gybe sharply, running up behind the green cat.

                                     LARRY

                         Coming up! Give way!

                                     ANDY

                         Like hell! We're on the starboard 

                         tack!

               THE SIZZLER AND THE "GREEN MACHINE"

               Running close to each other; very tight two-by-two.

                                     JACKIE

                         Don't let him pass. Faster!

               Mike and Larry silently fight for clean air, racing. Water 

               splashes over them.

                                     JACKIE

                         My hair's getting wet!

                                     ANDY

                         So's mine.

               CLOSE ON MIKE'S BOAT

               He veers onto a less dramatic tack, sparing Jackie's hair.

               Larry and Bob speed by, yelling.

                                     JACKIE

                         When do we get to the lighthouse?

                                     ANDY

                         Soon, dark eyes, soon.

                                     MIKE

                         The tide's turning.

               Andy reveals a knowledgeable side to his character.

                                     ANDY

                         We're going to be fighting the 

                         current.

                              (he looks up)

                         Wind's backing around a few points, 

                         too.

               Jackie snuggles against Mike.

                                     JACKIE

                         I can't wait to get there.

                                     ANDY

                         But of course.

               He goes forward to trim the jib, leaving the lovebirds 

               snuggling astern. They pull away from us, and we:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. AMITY WATERFRONT STREET - DAY

               Ellen and Brody are in the jeep; he's driving her to work.

               There's a crowd at dockside, and the town ambulance's now 

               familiar blinking red light. Brody, out of force of habit, 

               wheels the jeep towards the action, nudging through the crowd, 

               which gives way to the official blue-and-white vehicle.

                                     ELLEN

                         Hey -- it's not your job any more. 

                         I'm going to be late for work.

                                     BRODY

                         Just one minute...

               He gets out, and pushes through the crowd, Ellen following.

               DOCKSIDE

               The dive boat is moored at a clumsy angle next to the Police 

               Boat, where Hendricks has been pulling routine maintenance.

               The Police launch is cluttered with tools and spare parts; 

               some non-essential piece of gear is stripped and laid out on 

               the deck. Hendricks is on the dive boat, kneeling next to 

               Andrews.

               ABOARD THE DIVE BOAT

               Andrews is shaking, bloody froth on his lips and chest. The 

               shaken divers are huddled together, an ambulance attendant 

               is wheeling a gurney into position. Crosby and Sparky are 

               stunned.

                                     BRODY

                         What the hell happened?

                                     SPARKY

                         Embolism. Air bubbles in his blood. 

                         Came up too damn fast. Held his 

                         goddamn breath!

               He is near collapse himself.

                                     HENDRICKS

                         Easy...

                                     CROSBY

                         He panicked! Something scared him!

               An Ambulance Attendant is putting a blanket around Sparky.

                                     ATTENDANT

                         It's okay. We're taking care of him.

               The other attendant holds something out to Brody. Brody 

               examines it; a scuba mouthpiece, bitten in two, useless.

                                     BRODY

                         How'd this happen?

                                     SPARKY

                         Bite reflex, like a spasm.

                                     BRODY

                         When?

                                     HENDRICKS

                         Right after, the Kids went out?

                                     ELLEN

                         What Kids? Who went out?

                                     HENDRICKS

                         All of them. Mike, Junior Vaughn, 

                         Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all 

                         that whole gang.

                                     ELLEN

                         Mike? Our Mike?

                                     HENDRICKS

                         Yep. Looked like they were headed to 

                         the lighthouse.

                                     BRODY

                         How long ago?

                                     HENDRICKS

                         About an hour, maybe two.

                              (thinking)

                         Let's see -- I came on about eight...

               Brody is gone, pushing through the crowd.

               THE POLICE BOAT

               Brody is casting off lines. Ellen is on the dock, watching 

               him.

                                     ELLEN

                         What're you doing?

                                     BRODY

                         Going out.

                                     HENDRICKS

                         Uh, Chief -- look. You're not Chief 

                         any more.

               Brody keeps working, making ready for sea.

                                     HENDRICKS

                         I can't let you take her out.

                                     BRODY

                         You can't stop me.

               Ellen is climbing aboard, taking off her heels.

                                     HENDRICKS

                         Mrs. Brody, look -- if he can't go, 

                         then you can't go. Neither of you 

                         can go.

                                     ELLEN

                         I'm going.

                                     BRODY

                         Mike's out there.

                                     HENDRICKS

                         But I signed for the boat. You're 

                         not authorized any more.

               Brody starts the engines with a roar, and slams it into 

               reverse. The boat starts out of the slip, then lunges to a 

               halt, shuddering on its still-fastened bow mooring line.

                                     BRODY

                         Untie that rope.

                                     HENDRICKS

                         Please. It's my job.

                                     ELLEN

                         I'll do it.

               And she moves purposefully towards the boat cleat.

                                     HENDRICKS

                         Mrs. Brody, please...

               Brody is shifting gears, the boat is crabbing sideways as he 

               puts the helm hard over. It bumps the dock, hard.

                                     HENDRICKS

                         You're too close. Back off.

                                     BRODY

                         Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope 

                         there.

               Hendricks goes to the bow, jumps aboard and frees the bow 

               line. The boat slips into reverse, the water boiling as Brody 

               guns it away from the dock.

                                     HENDRICKS

                         Let me. Please.

               He takes the wheel, eases off on the rudder, and comes about, 

               pointing the launch out to sea.

                                     ELLEN

                         Hurry, please.

                                     HENDRICKS

                         What the hell, they can't fire both 

                         of us -- someone's got to be in 

                         charge, right? Which way are we going?

                                     BRODY

                         Find the Kids. The lighthouse -- you 

                         said something about the lighthouse. 

                         Get us there.

               WIDE ON THE HARBOR

               The Amity Police Boat, Brody, Ellen and Hendricks aboard, is 

               headed under full power out to sea. Hendricks is pumping the 

               horn, warning boats out of the way, ignoring the rules of 

               the road; as small boats scatter out of the way, we can see 

               the ambulance, red light flashing, pushing out slowly through 

               the crowd at dockside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ABOARD THE AMITY POLICE BOAT - DAY

               As they clear the harbor mouth, Brody is on the radio, Ellen 

               is crouching in the shelter of the deckhouse, Hendricks is 

               steering.

                                     BRODY

                         Amity Launch to Harbor Patrol, over.

                         Harbor Patrol. Is that you, Brody?

                                     BRODY

                         Affirmative. Can you get your chopper 

                         airborne?

                                     PATROL VOICE

                         10-4, in a few minutes. He's down 

                         checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.

                                     BRODY

                         Get him the hell over to Amity Point, 

                         the old lighthouse. Right now.

                                     PATROL VOICE

                         What for?

                                     BRODY

                         There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing 

                         that way. Turn them back to port.

                                     PATROL VOICE

                         That's it?

                                     BRODY

                         That's it. Just do it, all right?

                                     PATROL VOICE

                         10-4, soon as I can raise him.

                                     BRODY

                         If they're not at the light, look 

                         for them. I don't want them out there. 

                         Get them back to port!

                                     PATROL VOICE

                              (exasperated)

                         Affirmative, affirmative. Turn the 

                         Kids day-sailing back to port. I 

                         heard you. Patrol out.

               As Brody's eyes sweep the horizon anxiously, Hendricks pours 

               it on, and the police boat surges forward.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Hungry?

                         Starving. Let's go eat now.

                                     DONNIE

                              (shouting to Susie)

                         We're going in to eat!

               She nods agreement, their boats veer off from the rest and 

               head towards the lighthouse.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         interesting?

                         It's a bet. Once around the marker 

                         buoy?

                                     MIKE

                         That's the pin -- the buoy.

               Larry is confident -- he's got the air, but Mike suddenly 

               gybes without warning, snapping onto a new fast tack, 

               downwind. Larry and Bob are caught by surprise, and lose 

               precious moments as they fumble with their sails.

                                     ANDY

                              (pulling away)

                         Turkeys! Eat wind!

                                     MIKE

                         Yee-hah!

               He pounds with glee on the canvas trampoline as their boat 

               moves ahead, a drumming sound.

               UNDERWATER

               The twin hulls of a catamaran's hull, the muffled, eerie 

               sound of drumming, as the water carries the tempting "thud-

               thud-thud" sound down to the deep.

               ANGLE ON DOUG IN HIS INFLATABLE

               falling behind as the boats change course for the marker 

               buoy, following Larry and Mike's lead.

                                     DOUG

                         Hey! Wait for the H.M.S. Invincible!

               Brooke and Timmy sail by him, laughing; Polo with them.

                                     BROOKE

                         Can't -- we're watching a race!

                                     DOUG

                         Since when? Who's racing?

                                     TIMMY

                         Larry and Mike!

               PATRICK AND LUCY

               Pat and Lucy are trimming sail, moving faster.

                                     LUCY

                         Mike and Larry are racing! Loser 

                         goes home alone!

                                     PATRICK

                         If we beat them, they can both go 

                         home stag! Single-O! Alone! Jackie 

                         can come back in this boat!

                                     LUCY

                         What about me?

                                     PATRICK

                         Uh. Well. Maybe you could give Polo 

                         a hand going in...

                                     LUCY

                              (snapping him with a 

                              rope)

                         Your ass I will. Besides, the wind's 

                         turning with the tide. Sailing back 

                         is going to be a bitch.

               QUICK CUTS - SAILBOAT RACING MONTAGE

               --  Ropes and sails rattling through blocks.

               --  Sails snapping taut, filling with wind.

               --  Catamarans heeled over, racers hanging over the water, 

               dangerously suspended in trapeze harnesses.

               --  Skippers' faces, concentrating on boat handling.

               AERIAL VIEW - SAILBOATS

               It's the chopper's point of view, as the Harbor Patrol copter 

               from the Cape flies towards the Kids, following Brody's 

               previous instructions. He sees the sailboats and fly that 

               way.

                                     PILOT

                              (filtered, into his 

                              mike)

                         Air Patrol to Base. I have visual 

                         contact on the Kids. Going down to 

                         use the loud hailer...

               LOOKING UP AT THE APPROACHING COPTER

               It approaches the sailboats, losing altitude fast, rotor 

               blades chuffing up a storm.

               The Pilot has his microphone to his lips, and his voice is 

               blaring down at them.

                                     PILOT (V.O.)

                         This is the Harbor Patrol. Return to 

                         port immediately. Return -- to -- 

                         port -- immediately.

               THE BOATS

               The Kids look at each other, some coming about awkwardly, 

               others luffing, wondering what this is all about.

                                     ANDY

                              (to Mike)

                         Your dad must be really pissed.

                                     MIKE

                         We better go back in.

                                     ANDY

                         It's not going to be easy.

                                     JACKIE

                         What's wrong?

                                     MIKE

                         We're fighting wind and current. I 

                         though we'd be out longer, catch the 

                         incoming tide.

                                     ANDY

                         Putz -- that won't be for hours.

                                     MIKE

                         I was counting on hours.

                                     CHOPPER (V.O.)

                         Return -- to -- port.

                                     MIKE

                         We're trying, we're trying.

               He waves acknowledgement, and puts about. The others take 

               their cue from him, and set a rough course back, but without 

               much success.

               PATRICK AND LUCY

                                     LUCY

                         Heading back?

                                     PATRICK

                         Might as well.

               ANGLE ON THE THREE SLOOPS

               Polo, Timmy and Brooke, Marge and Sean. They see the faster 

               catamarans come about and try to beat back.

                                     POLO

                         They're turning around.

                                     LUCY

                         Coming about, then.

                                     SEAN

                         Are we going back?

                                     MARGE

                         Going to try. Lighthouse, everybody...

               She puts about, the three of them start back towards the 

               lighthouse, not making much headway. Doug's inflatable is 

               the slowest, and he is now, by virtue of his position, at 

               the head of the line beating back towards the island.

               DOUG'S BOAT

               The others in the b.g.

                                     DOUG

                         Make way for the Carrier Enterprise!

               INSERT - A WEAK PATCH IN THE RUBBER

               It whistles and visibly leaks under the strain.

               DOUG

               looking down in dismay.

                                     DOUG

                         Make that the Titanic.

               He rigs a little foot pump, and begins thumping away, trying 

               to breath air back into the raft.

               INT. CHOPPER - LOOKING DOWN AT THE SAILBOATS

                                     PILOT

                         Patrol One to Base. Looks like they're 

                         turning back.

                                     CONTROL

                         All right, Patrol. Go back to work. 

                         You've wasted enough time.

               UNDERWATER

               Looking up at the scattered hulls of the sailboats, the 

               turbulence from the low-flying chopper making a vast circular 

               pattern of irregular vibrations.

               LOOKING UP AT THE CHOPPER

               It wheels around, and heads back towards land.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ABOARD THE AMITY POLICE BOAT - DAY

               Rushing through the seas under full power. About three hundred 

               yards ahead, a small, seemingly empty sailboat; Ed and Tina's 

               Sandpiper. Further off, a day-sailing power cruiser, sport 

               fishing.

                                     ELLEN

                         Michael?

                                     BRODY

                         It's not his boat.

               Hendricks maneuvers closer, slowing the engine, reversing in 

               time to bring them alongside with a gentle bump. Ellen watches 

               apprehensively as Brody drops into the little boat.

                                     ELLEN

                         Be careful...

                                     HENDRICKS

                         Anything?

                                     BRODY

                              (on the Sandpiper)

                         Nope...

                              (he sees something)

                         Hold on...

               Brody moves around on the deck of the Sandpiper, until he 

               discovers Tina, cowering in shock; a sudden revealing of a 

               terrorized victim.

                                     BRODY

                         Tina!

                                     TINA

                              (a moan)

                         N-o-o-o-o-o-o...

                                     BRODY

                         It's okay, it's okay. What's the 

                         matter? Tina? Honey? Hey --

                                     TINA

                         No! It's still there!

                                     BRODY

                         What is it? What's there?

                                     TINA

                         It's still there!

                                     BRODY

                              (to Hendricks and 

                              Ellen)

                         I need a hand here...

               Hendricks has gotten a blanket, and he steps over, putting 

               it over the shivering girl's shoulders. Ellen comforts the 

               girl.

                                     ELLEN

                         Tina, baby... what is it?

                                     TINA

                         Sh... Sh... Shark...

               ANGLE ON BRODY - FOLLOWING HIM AS HE REACTS

                                     BRODY

                         I knew it. I goddamn well told them.

               He moves abruptly, stepping up onto the police launch, 

               snapping on the radio, leaving Hendricks, Ellen and Tina on 

               the sailboat moored alongside.

                                     BRODY

                         Amity Launch to Harbor Patrol.

                                     PATROL COMMANDER (V.O.)

                              (filter)

                         This is Cape Patrol -- what is it, 

                         Brody? I heard you weren't chief 

                         anymore.

                                     BRODY

                         Skip that. What about those kids out 

                         sailing?

                                     COMMANDER (V.O.)

                         It's all okay -- Colby got to them. 

                         They were turning back when he left 

                         'em.

                                     BRODY

                         He left them?

                                     COMMANDER (V.O.)

                         Sure. He's got work to do in Bay 

                         Channel.

                                     BRODY

                         Get him the hell back there! We got 

                         possible fatalities! Brody out...

               His eyes wild, Brody looks over at the Sandpiper, then scans 

               the nearby waters with sudden tension.

               BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW

               Ellen and Hendricks comforting Tina on the Sandpiper. Nearby, 

               a big cabin cruiser casually trolling by. Brody pulls the 

               police boat's air horn, the cruiser's passengers look over, 

               Hendricks and Ellen jump at the unexpected blast.

               ANGLE ON BRODY

                                     BRODY

                         I'm going out there.

                                     HENDRICKS

                         Hey -- you can't do that.

                                     ELLEN

                         What is it? What's the matter?

                                     BRODY

                         Mike's out there.

               Brody starts the launch's motor, throwing clear the mooring 

               line that ties the two boats together.

                                     BRODY

                              (to Hendricks)

                         Get her in. Get them both in.

                         ELLEN

                 Martin, please!

                                               Chief, be sensible...

                                     BRODY

                         Where are they?

                                     HENDRICKS

                         About 10 degrees off your starboard 

                         bow, take a heading leeward of Sand 

                         Island, and lay her north by 

                         northeast...

                                     BRODY

                         Never mind that shit. Just point.

               Hendricks complies.

                                     HENDRICKS

                              (pointing)

                         See where Cable Junction is? Look to 

                         the left. The lighthouse. That's it.

                                     BRODY

                         Got it.

               And he kicks the engine into gear, moving the launch away 

               and out toward the sea.

                                     ELLEN

                         Come back! Martin!

               He guns the engine as soon as he's clear. Hendricks gives 

               his jacket to a suddenly chilled Ellen, and hails the cabin 

               cruiser, already changing course to pick them up, sounding 

               its horn.

               Ellen stares after the receding boat.

                                     ELLEN

                         My purse is on that boat.

                                                                   CUT TO: 

               EXT. OCEAN - DAY - THE KID'S SAILBOATS

               They are trying to beat back towards the lighthouse, fighting 

               wind and tide. Only Doug's inflatable, with its clumsy little 

               motor, is making any headway.

               ANGLE ON DOUG

               playing at being Charles Laughton.

                                     DOUG

                         Mr. Christian! Mr. Christian! Pump 

                         up this boat! And shave that silly 

                         moustache!

               Pumping, steering, he's floundering along.

               UNDERWATER - MOVING TOWARDS THE SURFACE

               The Shark has fixated on something -- one outlying shape, 

               the easily identifiable outline of Doug's inflatable, thumping 

               and putting. It homes in on the sound.

               ANGLE ON DOUG AND THE KIDS

               The other kids exchange banter with Doug in his raft, as he 

               clowns for their benefit.

                                     DOUG

                         England expects every man to do his 

                         duty... You may fire when ready, 

                         Gridley... Damn the torpedoes, full 

                         speed ahead...

               Despite his pumping, the bulging patch bursts with a loud 

               bang.

                                     DOUG

                         Oh, shit.

                                     ANDY

                         Someone pop your balloon?

                                     DOUG

                         No problem, no problem.

                                     JACKIE

                         Want a lifesaver?

                                     MARGE

                         How about a skyhook?

                                     DOUG

                         You sail your boat, I'll sail mine.

               A fin rises partially, almost invisible to most of the kids, 

               but Mike notices it, believing it to be a porpoise.

                                     MIKE

                         Hey, Fetterman -- You got company.

                                     DOUG

                         Company? The place is a mess...

               Before anyone can react, the shape rises behind Doug, striking 

               his raft a terrible blow.

                                     DOUG

                         Whoops.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE OTHERS, WATCHING

               Not making any headway themselves, they casually watch the 

               class clown, wondering what he's up to this time.

               DOUG'S BOAT

               a distance from the rest. It shakes, then blows up as big 

               teeth grip it from below. Doug goes flying into the drink.

               The Shark has the inflatable in his teeth, and is shaking it 

               from side to side. Doug's eyes bug out as he sees what's 

               going on. He begins treading water, backing away as fast as 

               he can, waving his arm in the air frantically -- "pick me 

               up, quick..."

               MIKE'S BOAT

                                     MIKE

                         Doug's down!

               He sails to where Doug is being carried along by the current.

               The inflatable is a mess -- shredded rubber and dead engine; 

               the Shark didn't like it.

                                     ANDY

                         Doug! This way!

               Doug carefully -- oh, so carefully -- strokes over to where 

               Mike and Andy can pull him abroad. Some of the others sail 

               closer to get a look.

                                     PATRICK

                         What was that about?

                                     MARGE

                         You okay?

                                     LUCY

                         What was that?

                                     LARRY

                         So much for the rubber duck.

               THE GROUP, DRIFTING TOGETHER

               This incident hasn't yet touched them -- no one actually saw 

               what it was, except Doug, who's never been serious about 

               anything. Until now.

                                     DOUG

                         A shark ate my boat.

                                     BOB

                         Come on.

                                     DOUG

                         I'm telling you, a goddamn shark ate 

                         my goddamn boat!

                                     ANDY

                         If he liked your boat, I got some 

                         sneakers he'll love.

               There's nervous laughter from all around as they examine the 

               remains of Doug's inflatable. Some of those jagged rents 

               could be made by teeth...

                                     KIDS

                              (ad lib)

                         ...Jeez -- what did that?... A 

                         porpoise, maybe...Nah, killer whale... 

                         I think he snagged it... I hate to 

                         pop his balloon... (Etc.)

               ANGLE ON MIKE'S BOAT

               Doug's inflatable is draped over the tip of one hull, forward.

               Without warning, the Shark hits. Screams, terror, confusion.

               Mike, Andy, Jackie into the water.

               CLOSE ON MIKE

               His head bangs on a metal fitting as the boat turns over.

               ON THE GROUP

               Patrick and Lucy ram into Timmy's boat, locking into it, 

               knocking Timmy into the water as Brooke screams.

               CONFUSION

               As the following events take place:

               --  Larry's red cat rams and locks onto Mike's Tornado.

               --  Marge's boat capsizes, putting Sean and Marge into the 

               drink.

               --  Marge scrambles up on the over-turned hull, pulling Sean 

               up with her, just in time.

               --  Polo, under full sail, scoops Mike out of the water before 

               the Shark can get to him.

               --  The Shark dips out of sight.

               SURFACE, WIDE OVER THE STERN OF POLO'S BOAT

               showing the results of the turmoil:

               ANGLE ON THE SURVIVORS

               As they make ineffectual, frightened moves towards grouping 

               together, Andy is the first to gain any composure.

                                     ANDY

                         Raft up! Raft 'em up!

               He reaches towards a drifting line, and pulls Timmy's 

               Doughdish towards them, tying it off as it comes close.

                                     LARRY

                         Tie off to your strongest point.

                                     PATRICK

                         Anyone need an extra line?

               Polo has Mike and Timmy aboard his boat.  Timmy is looking 

               up from examining Mike's dazed body.

                                     TIMMY

                         Mike's bleeding!

                                     ANDY

                         Can you sail?

                                     POLO

                              (testing his rudder)

                         Yeah! We'll take him in!

               He starts to make sail back towards the lighthouse, on a 

               severe, but manageable tack. Polo, Timmy, and the injured 

               Mike sail towards safety, leaving the others behind.

               Tackle the job at hand, concentrating on survival. Jackie is 

               strangely quiet; things are out of control...

                                                                   CUT TO: 

               CLOSE ON A NAUTICAL CHART - DAY

               clearly marked: Amity Island, Amity Lighthouse, Cable 

               Junction. Brody's nervous finger traces an approximation of 

               his course. It fumbles, pauses, stops.

               ABOARD THE POLICE BOAT - DAY

               Brody, looking up from his chart, scans the ocean. Ahead is 

               the Lighthouse, his immediate destination. Out of sight to 

               the right, Cable Junction, and beyond that, 2500 miles of 

               cold Atlantic. Brody looks up from his chart, and grabs the 

               radio.

                         power, surging through the heavy 

                         swell, Brody very much alone at the 

                         helm.

               EXT. OCEAN, NEAR THE LIGHTHOUSE - DAY

               We can see Brody's boat approaching. It slows as it nears 

               the island.

               CLOSE ON BRODY

               staring, perplexed. Which way?

                         Shit.

               He puts the wheel over, slewing the boat around. To the left --  

               the wrong way.

               ANGLE ON THE BOAT, LIGHTHOUSE IN B.G.

               It barrels off to the left.

                         mind.

                         Anyone want to play charades?

               No one does.

                         As long as we're drifting, might as 

                         well go with the flow.

               Silence from the group.

                         They're probably looking for us.

                         Maybe it's gone.

                         They tend to follow moving things. 

                         Maybe it's following Polo and Timmy.

               They consider this.

                         So all we have to do is land at Cable 

                         Junction and wait.

                                     PATRICK

                         First we got to get there.

                         How're we going to do that floating 

                         on this garbage...?

                         Anyone got another set of sails?

               The Kids scramble to rig whatever canvas is available.

                         Is that big thing still out there?

               HELICOPTER (AERIAL) FLY-BY

               A panorama of open ocean; a quick fly-by to orient us: First, 

               Cable Junction, then, a mile or so ahead, the raft.

               THE RAFT

               More sail, some improvised rigging, Patrick and Lucy trimming 

               what there is, trying to steer the clumsy contraption. From 

               afar, the distant sound of an approaching chopper.

                                     LARRY

                         Hey!

                                     BOB

                              (waving)

                         Over here!

               The Kids react with enthusiasm to the arrival of the rescue 

               chopper.

                                     ANDY

                         Don't everyone jump around!

               But they ignore him. The copter is descending.

               INT. COPTER - DAY

               A one-man light spotter; the space next to the pilot cluttered 

               with tools and floats, lashed in place. Below, seen through 

               the plastic bubble, the raft growing larger as the chopper 

               sets down.

                                     PILOT

                         Air One to Base. I have a positive 

                         location on that sailing party. 

                         Disabled and adrift...

                              (he checks chart on 

                              his knee board)

                         ...about 3/4 miles west of Cable 

                         Junction, wind and current carrying 

                         them just about due east. I count 

                         ten juveniles.

               THE RAFT

               The helicopter is creating a lot of turbulence as it sets 

               down, a huge circular pattern of prop-wash on the surface as 

               the rotors slow to a halt. The Kids are waving and jubilant.

               ANGLE ON THE COPTER

               As the Pilot unbuckles, opens the door, and steps out on one 

               pontoon; he speaks through a bullhorn.

                                     PILOT

                         Everyone okay? Any injuries?

               The Kids ad-lib in the affirmative.

                                     ANDY

                         Can you put us on Cable Junction?

                                     PILOT

                         I got no room for passengers.

                                     ANDY

                         How about a tow? Can you rig that?

               The Pilot nods. Larry heaves a line to him, the Pilot catches 

               it and makes it fast to a convenient tie-off on the 

               undercarriage.

                                     LARRY

                         As soon as you get us on the island, 

                         you got to call in. My dad's the 

                         mayor...

                                     ANDY

                              (interrupting)

                         There's a shark...

               The other Kids all chime in, adding their ad-lib shouts 

               describing what happened, calling for help, etc. It's all a 

               noisy jumble, the Pilot ignores it, trying to do his job.

               ANGLE ON THE RAFT

               The Kids all shouting at once; Jackie is screaming.

                                     JACKIE

                         You have to take us off! You have 

                         to! Why don't you take us!

                                     DOUG

                              (calming her)

                         It's an observation spotter, he 

                         doesn't have the room...

               ANGLE ON THE PILOT

               He finishes tying off, and yells through his bullhorn at the 

               Kids.

                                     PILOT

                         Listen. I'm going to give you an 

                         assist to get you on Cable Junction. 

                         Then I'll call in, and get the Coast 

                         Guard to send a cutter. Hang on to 

                         something.

               He climbs into his bubble, shuts the door, gives the Kids a 

               "thumbs up," and starts the engine.

               QUICK CUTS - RAFT AND CHOPPER

               Engine turning over.

               A line tied off to one of the ringbolts on an overturned 

               hull; it pulls taut out of the water.

               INT. CHOPPER, THE PILOT INTENT ON HIS JOB.

               The raft, Kids watching in fascination and anticipation.

               The whole operation, getting under way.

               UNDERWATER

               looking up at pontoons, wreckage, wind turbulence on the 

               surface, the heavy "thud-thud-thud" of chopper blades.

               WIDE ON THE RAFT AND CHOPPER

               In the f.g., the fin rises, and starts for the scene.

               Follow it.

               CLOSE ON THE CHOPPER

               as it starts to lift, inexplicably. The Pilot reacts as;

               THE SHARK

               attacks one of the pontoons, biting down on it, clamping 

               great scarred jaws onto the bulbous floats.

               THE RAFT

               Kids screaming.

               QUICK CUTS

               --  Rotor blade spinning wildly.

               --  Pilot's hands jerked on the delicate controls.

               --  Med. shot, copter shaking.

               --  Closeup engine and gas tanks, rotor head spinning.

               --  Med. closeup Pilot in buffeting cockpit.

               RAFT AND COPTER

               The Kids watch, horror-stricken, as the giant Shark hangs on 

               the roaring copter; in the b.g., Cable Junction is looming 

               closer. The copter tilts dangerously, the Shark bites deeper, 

               harder.

               ANGLE ON THE COPTER

               as it tilts. Then, the unspeakable -- the blades touch the 

               water and explode. Chunks of murderous steel break off the 

               shattered blades and whistle through the air like projectiles.

               THE KIDS

               reacting, ducking in terror. Huge chunks of disintegrating 

               rotors are flying all around. Masts and sails left standing 

               before are chopped into a deadly salad. Screams.

               LOW IN THE WATER

               as blades skip and crash, the bubble of the overturned copter, 

               Pilot trapped inside, sinks into the sea.

               THE COPTER COCKPIT - UNDERWATER

               Pilot struggling with his safety harness, trying to hit 

               switches, working on instinct. Some air in the bubble, but 

               water too, and sparks as electrical connections short out 

               and burn.

               Then, the Shark, powering out of the murk.

               ANGLE ON THE PILOT - UNDERWATER

               as grim death batters at his fragile bubble. Screaming.

               The bubble cracks. Water floods, teeth snap at the slippery 

               plastic, the Pilot fumbles for oxygen as the Shark veers off 

               into the murk.

               ON THE SURFACE - THE RAFT

               The Kids, reacting as the broken copter sinks beneath the 

               waves. Calm for a moment, then:

                                     LARRY

                         Look out!

                                     JACKIE

                              (screams)

                         No-o-o-o!

               The Shark reappears, and batters at the raft.

               SHARK ATTACK

               The raft shudders, and begins to break up under the pounding.

               The Kids cling for their lives to masts and wreckage.

               Marge's overturned hull is struck a fierce blow from beneath.

                                     SEAN

                         Help!

               He and Marge topple into the water.

                                     ANDY

                         Don't struggle!

               Sean is bobbing in his life-vest, Marge strokes to be near 

               him.

               ANGLE ON MARGE AND SEAN

               in the water, swimming for the apparent safety of the raft.

               Then, the fin, and the massive bulk of the killer, heaving 

               up through the waves.

                                     MARGE

                         Sean!

               She heaves him up out of the water, hurling him with 

               desperation towards the safety of the floating hull.

               ANGLE ON SEAN

               screaming, hands and feet scrabbling like a monkey as he 

               struggles for a grip on the slippery surface. Behind him, 

               Marge helping as much as she can from the water. Then, behind 

               her;

               THE SHARK

               rising like grey doom, then dropping out of sight. Marge is 

               gone.

               UNDERWATER

               Marge ducking under the bulk of the Shark, shoving off with 

               panicky reserves of strength, swimming away underwater, while 

               the Shark takes a massive crunching bite out of a submerged 

               hull.

               Follow Marge as she swims.

               COPTER WRECKAGE

               Huddled in the cracked plastic bubble, the Pilot is sucking 

               air from his oxygen tank. He sees Marge, and slips out of 

               his bubble, headed for her.

               MARGE

               As the Pilot overtakes her -- a moment of horror, as she 

               thinks the Shark has found her, then relief, as the Pilot 

               motions to the bubble, and indicates "Air." She follows him.

               MARGE AND THE PILOT

               Scuttling like two crabs into the shelter of the broken 

               chopper, buddy breathing as he passes her the oxygen tube.

               The chopper tilts, and moves, breaking up on the bottom as 

               currents move it. They struggle silently.

               ANGLE ON THE CHOPPER

               as it slips across the bottom, the current pulling it, broken 

               parts breaking off in slow motion, dirty swirls of oil and 

               hydraulic fluid clouding the water.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ON THE SURFACE - THE RAFT

               A parallel struggle for survival, as the current separates 

               Sean from the other Kids; Marge is gone, the little boy is 

               clinging alone to the free-floating Lightening.

                                     PATRICK

                         Sean! Sean!

                                     ANDY

                         Don't move!

                                     SEAN

                         Andy! Please help! Help!

               ON THE SURFACE - A DISTANCE AWAY

               Copter wreckage is bubbling up from underneath, like a 

               submarine destroyed by depth charges; an oil slick, pieces 

               of broken blade, a seat cushion, then, suddenly, the Pilot, 

               and Marge, almost choked to death, their air run out. They 

               cling to a section of pontoon, panting, looking around with 

               oxygen-starved eyes.

               They are alone on the ocean; a half-mile away, the distant 

               sails of the broken raft, and the low-lying shape of Cable 

               Junction. Safe, for now...

                                                                   CUT TO: 

               BRODY - ALONE IN THE POLICE BOAT - DAY

               He throttles down, and the boat slumps in the water. He looks 

               around, sees nothing, in all directions. He hits his radio.

                                     BRODY

                         Harbor Air, this is Brody. Air One, 

                         come in.

               Static, no answer. He tries a couple of times, checking the 

               knobs and dials to make sure the unit's working.

                                     BRODY

                         Harbor Air, do you read? Over?

                                     PATROL VOICE

                         Brody? This is Patrol Base.

               The familiar voice is tinged with annoyance. He's had a long 

               shift, and nothing's going right.

                                     BRODY

                         Where the hell is Air One?

                                     PATROL VOICE

                         That's what I'd like to know. Lost 

                         transmission at Cable Junction.

                                     BRODY

                         Did he raise the Kids?

                                     PATROL VOICE

                         Last transmission said ten juveniles.

                                     BRODY

                         Yeah? Then what?

                                     PATROL VOICE

                         Then nothing. If you see him, tell 

                         him to switch to an operational 

                         frequency, or give me a status report 

                         yourself.

                                     BRODY

                         Did you say Cable Junction?

                                     PATROL VOICE

                         That's what he said.

                                     BRODY

                         When?

                                     PATROL VOICE

                         1530 hours. Might still be there. 

                         Base out.

               Brody revs up, and powers out, headed for Cable Junction.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OCEAN - DAY - THE RAFT

               Sean is crying on his isolated perch, clinging to the upturned 

               keel. The other Kids are throwing a rope, trying to get him 

               back. Patrick heaves, and misses.

                                     LARRY

                         Sean! Catch the rope!

                                     BOB

                         The rope! The rope!

               The others shoot fearful glances at the waters.

                                     PATRICK

                         He's got to help or it won't work.

                                     LUCY

                         Sean, baby, please...

               Sean is ignoring the efforts to rescue him, paralyzed by 

               fear, he shivers alone. Jackie is near catatonia herself, 

               Brooke and Doug trying to soothe her.

                                     JACKIE

                         It killed her. It ate her.

                                     BROOKE

                         Shh. Shhh...

                                     DOUG

                         It's okay, it's okay...

                                     ANDY

                         Sean! Listen! Listen to me, Sean.

               The kid looks up dully.

                                     ANDY

                         Goddamn it, Sean, you listen to me 

                         or I will kick your ass, do you hear 

                         me?

                                     LUCY

                         Listen to Andy, Sean.

                                     ANDY

                         We're throwing a rope and you better 

                         catch it, hear?

               Sean nods. The other Kids are encouraged. The rope is thrown -- 

               it misses.

                                     ANDY

                              (to Bob)

                         Keep an eye out for that fish.

               Bob climbs to a vantage point, watching.

                                     LARRY

                         Throw it.

                                     ANDY

                         Sean! Catch it!

               Another miss. In his haste to help, Larry overreaches to 

               fish the trailing rope out of the water, and falls headlong 

               into the sea. Shrieks of fright from the others.

                                     LUCY

                         Larry!

               He scrambles out, hardly wet, that's how fast he's moving.

               Finally -- Patrick takes the crucial throw, and the rope 

               practically knocks Sean off his perch, but he clutches and 

               holds it. As Andy carefully calls instructions, Sean secures 

               the rope and the others carefully, carefully begin to pull 

               him in.

               ANGLE - ON SEAN

               as they pull. The slippery rope is undoing itself.

               THE RAFT

               With the kids reaching out hands, sticks, rope, anything to 

               pull the little one to safety. The ocean swells rise and 

               fall with hidden menace.

               QUICK CUTS

               --  Hands gripping rope.

               --  The knot, pulling apart.

               --  Anguished faces, concentrating, as Patrick, Lucy, Larry, 

               and Andy struggle to bring him in.

               ANDY AND SEAN

               Success. He's pulled to safety. They lash his little hull as 

               tight as they can to the rest of the floating wreckage.

               Bob sees something.

                                     BOB

                         Cable Junction's ahead!

                                     LUCY

                         Can we make it?

                                     BOB

                         I don't know.

               BOB'S POINT OF VIEW

               looking over the wreckage to Cable Junction, now much closer.

               Beyond it, miles of empty Atlantic. It's off to one side, 

               and unless they can slow down or alter course, they will 

               miss it.

               THE RAFT

                                     LARRY

                              (to Jackie)

                         You okay?

               She's not. Shaking, silent, eyes glazed.

                                     LUCY

                              (alone)

                         Dear Jesus, Holy Mary, Mother of 

                         God, help us, please...

                              (her lips move 

                              inaudibly)

                                     BROOKE

                              (to Doug)

                         Keep her warm. 

                              (to Jackie)

                         Jackie? Baby?

                                     PATRICK

                         Can someone help me rig a jury rudder?  

                         We might steer this...

               Andy joins him, and they try to make a sweep or a rudder out 

               of whatever wreckage they can use.

                                     DOUG

                         By 7:46, when the tide turns around, 

                         we'll be twenty miles out. More, 

                         with this wind.

                                     LARRY

                         Shut up.

                                     DOUG

                         I can't stop thinking!

                                     LUCY

                              (praying aloud)

                         God, please help us, Merciful Father, 

                         in Christ's name, we beg you, help 

                         us, please, Dear God, save us, help 

                         us, please, God, help...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BRODY'S POLICE BOAT - DAY

               He is rounding a sand bar off the lighthouse when he looks 

               ahead and sees the bright sails of some of the survivors' 

               boats.

                                     BRODY

                         Thank Christ.

               He puts the helm over and heads for them.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OCEAN NEAR LIGHTHOUSE - DAY

               Polo's sloop is beating back towards the harbor when the 

               police launch bears down, Brody leaning on the air horn.

               The Kids signal and wave.

                                     POLO

                         Over here! Yo!

                                     BRODY

                         I'm coming alongside!

               The launch slows clumsily. Timmy gets a line around a cleat, 

               and pulls them fast.

                                     BRODY

                         Mike? Is that you?

                                     MIKE

                         Pop. I'm sorry.

                                     BRODY

                         It's okay. What happened?

                                     POLO

                         A shark hit us out there.

                                     TIMMY

                         Mike got knocked over.

               Brody goes for his radio, to report in, to call for help.

                                     MIKE

                         I passed out, but I'm okay.

                                     BRODY

                         At least you're safe. What about the 

                         others?

               The three boys look at each other.

                                     BRODY

                         Jesus, don't freeze on me. What about 

                         the others?

                                     MIKE

                              (tears in his eyes)

                         Sean's still out there.

                                     BRODY

                         What?

               He stops in his tracks, radio forgotten. heartsick. Mike 

               goes on,

                                     MIKE

                         He wanted to come. It was okay, wasn't 

                         it? It was okay before...

                                     POLO

                         The others are ratted together. 

                         Drifting.

                                     BRODY

                         Which way?

                                     TIMMY

                         With the current. Towards Cable 

                         Junction.

               Brody jerks the mooring line holding them together, freeing 

               it. He starts for his controls, obsessed.

                                     MIKE

                         Dad, I'm sorry...

                                     BRODY

                         Stay here. Don't go anywhere. Just 

                         stay here.

               He indicates the lighthouse, then guns his engine.

                                     BRODY

                         Stay at the lighthouse!

               He roars off, headed towards Cable Junction.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OCEAN - DAY - THE RAFT

               approaching Cable Junction the rafted boats are drifting 

               towards the Cable Junction.  Larry, Patrick and Andy are 

               working on improvised tiller lines to a jury rudder made out 

               of wreckage. Lucy has another line out to a sea anchor, trying 

               to slow their drift.

                                     ANDY

                         Bring her to port a little. That's 

                         it -- steady.

                                     DOUG

                         I think we're changing course a 

                         little.

                         If we can get to it.

                                     JACKIE

                         We're going to die.

               The inverted mast of one of the wrecked boats is snagged on

               The group subsides, only Jackie is left, keening to herself.

               There's a distant sound of a boat's engine. Bob spots it

               Brody fumbles with the throttle, manages to hold his boat 

               steady between the raft and Cable Junction island.

                         Can you get us a line?

               Brody finds a coil of line, makes one end fast, then throws 

               it to the Kids on the raft. They catch it, and tie it off to 

               a cleat.

               Brody throttles forward, the police boat shudders under the 

               strain as the line goes taut.

               ANGLE ON THE RAFT

               where the rope is tied off to a cleat. The wood groans, screws

               as he repositions; he's now between the raft and the island, 

               preparing to throw his line. He heaves, the Kids grab, they 

               have it, they tie off again,

                                     ANDY

               Brody starts to pull the raft again, when:

               THE SHARK

               surfaces, and moves purposefully towards the gap that 

               separates the police boat from the raft. It lunges at Brody 

               as it passes the launch; the fin hits the taut rescue line, 

               snapping it.

               ANGLE ON BRODY'S BOAT

               Brody recoils in horror as the beast rushes past, he spins 

               the wheel and hits the throttle, sending the launch hard to 

               port. Out of control, it runs up on the rocks of Cable 

               Junction.

               INSIDE THE BOAT

               as it tips up on the rocks. Brody falls, equipment and loose 

               material breaks loose and falls.

               INSERT - THE RADIO

               held by only a few screws, it pulls out of its mount and 

               shatters on the deck.

               lifting high out of the water, the screw turning in air.

               THE KIDS ON THE RAFT

               Their horrified reactions.

               BRODY IN THE BOAT

               picks himself up, and staggers to the rail, sees his 

               predicament.

                         I'm okay, baby, I'm here. It's okay...

               He climbs over the rail, onto the slippery wet rocks, trying 

               to get to where he can help. The Shark patrols the gap, 

               waiting.

                                     BRODY

                         Can you get a line to me?

               ABOARD THE RAFT

               the Kids find some line. Andy coils, and throws.

               CABLE JUNCTION - THE RAFT

               Brady catches the Kids' line. He heaves on it with all his 

               might. Nothing. Jackie is hysterical, some of the other Kids 

               are screaming. The Shark's fin catches the taut line, it 

               slides up and over, Brody and the Kids are nearly pulled 

               into the water. The raft doesn't budge.

               UNDERWATER

               the mast bends under the strain, but holds the raft stuck 

               fast.

               CABLE JUNCTION - BRODY AND THE KIDS

               He sees the winch and hooks on his launch, and makes the 

               towline fast to the steel winch cable; puts it in neutral.

               The Kids haul their line, trying to bring the steel cable to 

               them.

               The shark rams their raft, impatient now. Screams and 

               scrambling as they let go their line and try to avoid the 

               beast. Brooke huddles with Sean, Jackie cowers alone. Larry 

               is lashing his big buck knife to a pole, an improvised weapon.

               ANGLE ON THE WINCH LINE

               Unattended, it drops into the water.

               THE KIDS

                         Get the cable in! Pull!

               They do, but now the winch cable is snagged under the surface.

               It comes taut, but doesn't budge. Brody watches, helpless 

               for the moment.

                                     BRODY

                         Son of a bitch is stuck!

               BRODY

               climbs back onto the boat, starts the winch engine, trying 

               to pull the cable free.

               THE SHARK

               on the offensive now, takes an outrigger pontoon, biting it, 

               tearing it off the raft, shaking everything.

               ON THE RAFT

               the Kids react to this fresh attack.

                                     DOUG

                         It's killing us!

                         I don't want to die! Mommy!

               IN THE BOAT

               The winch smokes and stalls, the weight it's pulling almost 

               too much.

                                     BRODY

                         Come on, you bastard, come on, pull.  

                         Pull!

               THE RAFT

               bursts apart from the center as the Shark lunges up through 

               the canvas trampoline of the Sizzler. The Kids, screaming, 

               fall into the water as the attack forces the fragile structure 

               into pieces. Only Sean, Brooke, and Jackie are left on the 

               remaining segment.

               ANGLE ON BRODY

               watching the destruction, seeing Sean practically alone in 

               the water.

                                     BRODY

                         Sean! Hang on!

               He looks around the deck frantically, spots a rubber emergency 

               inflatable in its case. He wrestles it off its brackets, and 

               breaks the seals urgently. He hits the auto-inflate.

               BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW - SEAN

               Alone on the raft, Brooke and Jackie helpless nearby, the 

               other Kids flailing in the water. The huge bulk of the Shark, 

               fin cutting the water as it closes in on the confusion.

               IN THE WATER

               While Brody inflates the rubber raft and throws it in the 

               water, the Kids scramble for safety, swimming for their lives.  

               Each one is sure this moment is going to be his last.

                                     ANDY

               Andy is pulling himself towards the boat, scrambling up on 

               the exposed wooden hull.

                                     PATRICK

               As she looks over her shoulder and screams -- the monster is 

               sliding past her, intent on Bob. The rough hide scrapes her, 

               tearing her clothes, leaving raw bleeding lacerations on her 

               torso.

                                     LUCY

                         I'm bleeding!

               Larry and Patrick help her towards the rocks.

                         Help!

               He's clinging to a piece of broken boat; the Shark lunges at 

               him.

               INSERT - WINCH

               grinding, smoking, hauling something out of the water -- 

               heavy, slimy, dripping metal cable, the main powerline from

               BRODY IN THE WATER

               paddling the raft towards Sean with desperate strokes,

               He fights to see in the gathering gloom. Suddenly, a strange 

               glare snaps on, then more illumination, in a series of 

               escalating clicks.

               CABLE JUNCTION

               Silhouetted against the evening sky. Automatic timers are 

               turning on navigation and worklights, illuminating the barren 

               rocks and rusty steel with their glare -- throwing dark 

               shadows, putting the surrounding water into black limbo by 

               their contract.

               ANGLE ON BRODY

               straining to see what's going on. Looking for his son.

                                     SEAN (O.S.)

                         Dad! Help! Daddy!

                                     BRODY

                         I'm coming!

               He looks around desperately, sees Andy safe on the launch.

                                     BRODY

                         Andy! Use the lights! The lights!

               ANGLE ON ANDY

               soaked, clinging to the rail of the launch, hearing Brody, 

               fumbling in the cabin, turning on worklights, the boat 

               throwing erratic shafts of powerful light from its many lamps 

               and searchlights. Andy grabs one and sweeps the water with 

               it, trying to help.

                                     ANDY

                         Where are you? Chief!

               His light pokes and sweeps through the gloom.

               BRODY IN THE WATER

               He hears the horrendous sounds of wood and metal breaking, 

               as the raft pounds to pieces on the rocks. He is blinded by 

               the sweeping searchlight, the confusion of terror-stricken 

               teen-agers screaming. It's the middle of The Inferno.

               BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW - SEAN

               Sean, standing up, reaching out to him, the Shark hitting 

               his fragile perch, Sean tumbling backwards, towards what 

               seems to be certain death.

                                     BRODY (O.S.)

                         Sean!

               ANGLE ON BRODY

               as he hurls his paddle at the Shark, anything to get even, 

               to distract it.

                                     BRODY

                         You bastard!

               He looks around him wildly, searching for a weapon, finding 

               a steel boathook. He screams at the unfeeling Shark...

                                     BRODY

                         Come here, you son-of-a-bitch!

               The huge gray hulk obligingly turns towards this new 

               irritation. Brody bangs on the raft, yelling, creating a 

               commotion.

               THE SHARK SPEEDS TOWARDS HIM

               THE SHARK

               lunges at the raft, Brody sliding desperately away, smashing 

               at the snout with his steel, the tail fin bashing him as it 

               passes...

               ANGLE ON THE STERN OF THE POLICE BOAT

               Brody is drifting close to the cable, drawn heavy and wet 

               cut of the water. He reaches up to it.

               ANGLE ON BRODY

               dangling his feet in the water, holding onto the cable, seeing 

               it, inspired with a lunatic idea...

                                     BRODY

                         Over here! You bastard! Over here

               THE SHARK

               turns, bleeding from a superficial cut on its snout, its 

               scar glistening wet and terrible. It heads for Brody.

               BRODY

               Possessed, yelling at the top of his lungs.

                                     BRODY

                         Come and get me! Come and get me!

               THE SHARK

               Attacking. Missing Brody, who hauls himself up out of the 

               way in life-or-death spasm. The great jaws close, fastening 

               onto the thick cable. Shaking it. The cable resists for a 

               moment, then splits, layers or insulation and armor crack 

               open, the jaws clamp harder -- 20,000 tons of pressure -- 

               then the live copper core is reached. Zap!

               THE SHARK

               dying. Leaping and convulsing as hundreds of thousands of 

               volts surge through its body, grounded in the salt sea. Hot 

               white fire shimmers like a halo, the fish smokes and stinks, 

               sputters, and dies.

               BRODY

               watching, cowering on the rubber raft to which he fell when 

               the shark hit the cable. It's strangely silent. The lights 

               on Cable Junction flicker and die as circuit breakers shut 

               down the mains, protecting the line. Only the boat's 

               worklights provide light now.

                                     BRODY

                         Sean?

               No answer. Water lapping at the rocks, some Kids sobbing 

               quietly. Brody listlessly paddles towards the wreckage of 

               the raft, expecting the worst...

               ANGLE ON THE WRECKAGE

               Timmy's Doughdish, where we last saw Sean. There's a 

               scrabbling from inside, and Sean appears, soaked, from under 

               the seat where he'd fallen.

                                     SEAN

                         Dad?

               Brody moves toward him, holds out his arms, taking Sean onto 

               his raft. They paddle back towards the rocks.

               THE ISLAND

               with the Kids clinging like drowned rats to the rocks; they're 

               wet, scared, exhausted, but safe. Sean hugs his daddy as 

               they step onto land.

                                     SEAN

                         They made me go with them.

                                     BRODY

                         Sure they did...

               He kisses the damp forehead.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. AMITY HARBOR - DAY

               A crowd of worried parents and adults, Ellen and Hendricks 

               in the forefront, are staring towards the harbor mouth. It's 

               dawn and the sun is rising. They see something, a cheer goes 

               up.

               ANGLE ON THE WATER

               A big Coast Guard cutter is steaming into the harbor, a little 

               group of survivors on the foredeck.

               CLOSE ON THE CUTTER

               Brody and the surviving Kids wave to their families on land.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               ROLL END CREDITS.

                                         THE END
