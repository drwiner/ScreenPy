               OVER BLACK

               Sounds of the innerspaces rushing forward.

               Then a splinter of blue light in the center of the picture.

               It breaks wide, showing the top and bottom a silhouetted 

               curtain of razor sharp teeth suggesting that we are inside 

               of a tremendous gullet, looking out at the onrushing undersea 

               world at night. HEAR a symphony of underwater sounds: 

               landslide, metabolic sounds, the rare and secret noises that 

               certain undersea species share with each other. Also, the 

               hint of familiar music, twisted and distorted by the depths.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BEACH  NIGHT  SHARK'S POINT OF VIEW  RISING OUT OF 

               THE WATER, LOOKING AT

               It is a pleasant, moonlit, windless night in mid-June. We 

               see a long straight stretch of white beach. Behind the low 

               dunes are the dark shapes of large expensive houses. Hear a 

               number of voices singing. It sounds like an eastern 

               university's alma mater, no longer distorted.

               EXT. BEACH  NIGHT  ANOTHER ANGLE

               Around a blazing bonfire, a group of young men and women, 

               beer cans (or maybe a keg) in evidence, as well as the bota 

               Spanish leather wine-bag much in favor by beach and ski-bum 

               types.

               The group is swapping sentimental alma maters, weepily singing 

               eastern Ivy League anthems - Dartmouth, Cornell, Harvard, 

               Penn, etc. Two young people break away from the others. They

               are Tom Cassidy and Chrissie. Behind them, there is 

               considerable necking activity; Tom and Chrissie are more 

               serious.

               TOM

               Makes a clumsy attempt at snaring Chrissie, cups her from 

               behind. She squirms playfully out of his grasp. We discover 

               he's not especially sober.

                                     TOM

                         Hey! Hey hey! I'm with you, right?

               EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE BEACH  NIGHT

               Tom and Chrissie are separated from the others, silhouetted 

               against the fire, she pauses and looks at the ocean, he is 

               plodding along in the sand, winded.

               Chrissie runs down the slope of the dune towards the water, 

               leaving Tom reeling atop the dune. As she runs, she is 

               shedding her clothes. Tom is trying to trail her by her 

               clothes, like Hansel following bread crumbs through the woods.

               But Chrissie is way ahead of him.

                                     CHRISSIE

                         C'mon!

               She runs headlong into the inviting sea, plunges cleanly 

               into the water with a light "Whoops!" as the cold water sweeps 

               over her.

               Behind all this, we continue to hear the sentimental, beery 

               chorus of alma maters.

               Then we see it -- a gentle bulge in the water, a ripple that 

               passes her a dozen feet away. A pressure wave lifts her up, 

               then eases her down again, like a smooth, sudden swell.

                                     CHRISSIE

                         Tommy? Don't dunk me...

               She looks around for him, finds him still on the beach, his 

               feet tangled in his pants, which have dropped around his 

               ankles. She starts to swim back in to him.

               EXT. CHRISSIE IN THE WATER

               Her expression freezes. The water-bulge is racing towards 

               her. The first bump jolts her upright, out of the water to 

               her hips. She reaches under water to touch her leg. Whatever 

               she feels makes her open her mouth to scream, but she is 

               slammed again, hard, whipped into an arc of about eight feet, 

               up and down, submerging her down to her open mouth, choking 

               off any scream she might try to make. Another jolt to her 

               body, driving her under so that only her hair swirls on the 

               surface. Then it too is sucked below in a final and terrible 

               jerking motion. HOLD on the eddies and swirls until we're 

               sure it's all over.

               EXT. CLOSE ON TOM ON BEACH

               In his shorts, laughing to himself, turning in slow stoned 

               circles, held prisoner by his windbreaker which seems to 

               have him in an armlock, as he struggles to free his arm from 

               a tight sleeve. As he turns, we hear the alma maters in the 

               background, from the fire.

               INT. BRODY HOUSE - BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

               A shaft of morning sun blasts through the crack between the 

               bottom of the shade and the windowsill, falling across the 

               heads of the sleeping couple on the bed. It catches Martin 

               Brody right across the eyes, bringing him up from sleep.  

               The job is completed by the clock radio, which clicks on 

               with local fisherman's report and weather.

                                     RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

                         Hayes Landing reports conditions 

                         good, with stripers and jacks. The 

                         Coast Guard has no storm warning 

                         from Block Island to Cape Hatteras; 

                         a light chop with freshening winds, 

                         continued clear and mild... (etc.)

               Ellen Brody burrows her head under the covers, avoiding 

               morning for a few precious minutes more.

                                     BRODY

                         How come the sun didn't used to shine 

                         in here?

                                     ELLEN

                         'cause when we bought the house it 

                         was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the 

                         dogs.

               We hear the scampering toenails of two cocker spaniels 

               scrabbling around the foot of the bed. Brody swings out of 

               bed, wearing shorts, socks, and tee shirt.

                                     BRODY

                         Right.

                                     ELLEN

                         Do you see the kids?

                                     BRODY

                         Probably out in the back yard.

                                     ELLEN

                         In Amity, you say 'Yahd.'

                              (she gives it the 

                              Boston sound)

                                     BRODY

                         The kids are in the yahd, playing 

                         near the cah. How's that sound?

                                     ELLEN

                         Like you're from N'Yawk.

                              (gives it Brooklyn 

                              sound)

                                     BRODY

                         Give me 30 years, I'll get it.

               He leads the dogs out of the bedroom and down to the kitchen.

               INT. BRODY KITCHEN - MORNING

               Brody enters, sets down some dog food, goes to make coffee, 

               starts to fill kettle to boil water, the cold water rushes 

               through and out the burnt-out bottom of the kettle.

                                     BRODY

                         Did you burn another kettle? Y'know 

                         you're a fire hazard? This is the 

                         third one!

                                     ELLEN (O.S.)

                         I never hear the whistle.

                                     BRODY

                         Feed the dogs.

               Ellen Brody, a tall, attractive blonde woman, enters from 

               upstairs. She's still slightly sleepy, not what you'd call 

               an "Instant-On" person. Mornings are not her best time.

                                     ELLEN

                         You want to go through those?

                              (she indicates bag of 

                              clothes)

                         I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop.  

                         It's Marcia Vaughn's pet charity.  

                         Pick out what you want to keep -- 

                         it's mostly your city clothes.

                                     BRODY

                              (looking through bag, 

                              remembering)

                         I used to wear this to the Garden. 

                         Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers.

                              (he puts it all behind)

                         Ship it.

                                     ELLEN

                         Don't be silly - You're going to 

                         make summer better for them...

               Before Brody can answer, Michael, his oldest boy, enters, 

               holding his hand. There is bright new blood on it, but he is 

               sensibly unconcerned. It's a normal childhood scrape.

                                     MICHAEL

                         Cut my hand. Hit by a vampire.

                                     BRODY

                         On the swing? I told you not to play 

                         near there until I sanded it down.

                              (to Ellen)

                         See what your son did?

                                     ELLEN

                         Go upstairs and bring Mommy a band-

                         aid.

               Michael goes on out and upstairs. Ellen fumbles in her pocket 

               and produces Brody's new glasses, which she holds out to 

               him.

                                     ELLEN

                         Don't forget these.

                                     BRODY

                         Oh, yeah.

                              (he puts them on)

                         How do I look? Older, huh?

                                     ELLEN

                         I think they make you look sexy.

               Brody reacts to this, and bends to kiss her lightly. Then 

               more seriously.

                                     BRODY

                         Sexy, hm? What was I before?

                                     ELLEN

                         Older, sillier.

                                     BRODY

                              (as he goes to make 

                              coffee, he fumbles 

                              with the new glasses)

                         I don't want to depend on these 

                         things, y'know - sometimes you can 

                         weaken your eyes.

               He looks out the window to the view beyond, discovering some 

               new wonder in the fresh sunlit morning.

               BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW  OUTSIDE THE HOUSE

               Sean, the younger child, is happily romping in the summer 

               air, enjoying the very air he breathes.

                                     BRODY

                         Let's see...

               The phone rings.

               INT. BRODY KITCHEN  DAY

               Brody answers one of two phones on the wall.

                                     BRODY

                         Brody... yeah, what's up... mmm... 

                         Well, what do they usually do, float 

                         or wash up? Really?... okay, I'll 

                         meet both of you at the beach in

                              (checks watch)

                         ...20 minutes, okay? Okay.

                              (hangs up)

                         First goddamn weekend of the summer.

               Michael reenters in bathing trunks, with a towel on his 

               shoulder, his hand washed, holding a band-aid ready for 

               application. Ellen takes it, and bandages the finger with 

               care and affection.

                                     ELLEN

                         There.

                              (to Brody)

                         What was that?

               Michael heads toward the beach.

                                     BRODY

                              (struggling to get 

                              his shirt on over 

                              his glasses)

                         The office.

               He gets his shirt on with Ellen's help. She flicks imaginary 

               dust from the badge on his chest.

                                     ELLEN

                         Be careful.

                                     BRODY

                         Here? You gotta be kiddin'.

               He gives her a light kiss, starts to go, with his cup.

                                     BRODY

                         Love ya.

                                     ELLEN

                              (kissing him back)

                         Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.

               At the door, he takes a windbreaker off a peg and goes on 

               out.

               We can see the Amity Police shoulder patch as he goes to a 

               van parked outside.

               EXT. ISLAND HIGHWAY - MORNING

               Martin Brody's Country Squire police wagon rushes past, taking 

               the view to an enormous billboard depicting a typical summer 

               day in Amity. A beautiful model splashes in the gold surf, 

               languishing in a Solarcaine sun. AMITY WELCOMES YOU is written 

               above her flailing arms.

               EXT. AMITY BEACH - DAY

               Three small figures in the landscape, walking the beach. The 

               surf is rough and there is sea-floor debris strewn about 

               from the receding tide.

               CLOSER ANGLE

               Deputy Hendricks is searching the shore about one hundred 

               yards down wind. Meanwhile, Brody, in his casual police 

               attire, and Tom Cassidy, still in the clothing we saw him in 

               last night, walk down the beach. Brody fingers the missing 

               girl's shoes, purse and clothes. In the daylight, Cassidy 

               misconducts himself, wavering between inflated maturity and 

               tear-blown adolescence.

                                     BRODY

                         Christine what?

                                     CASSIDY

                         Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one 

                         ever died on me before.

                                     BRODY

                         You picked her up on the ferry.

                                     CASSIDY

                         I didn't know her.

                                     BRODY

                         And nobody else saw her in the water?

                                     CASSIDY

                         Somebody could've -- I was sort of 

                         passed out.

                                     BRODY

                         Think she might've run out on you?

                                     CASSIDY

                         Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman 

                         do that. I'm sure she drowned.

                                     BRODY

                         You from around here?

                                     CASSIDY

                         No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's 

                         in Tuxedo, New York, though.

                                     BRODY

                         You here for the summer?

                                     CASSIDY

                         Some friends and me took a house.

                                     BRODY

                              (genuinely curious)

                         What d'you pay for a place just for 

                         the summer?

                                     CASSIDY

                         A thousand apiece, something like 

                         that. There's five of us. And we 

                         each kick in a hundred a week for 

                         beer and cleaning, stuff like that.

                                     BRODY

                         Pretty stiff.

               A shrill whistle makes them turn. Hendricks is fifty yards 

               away, on his knees. He blows again, a feeble report this 

               time.

                                     BRODY

                         Maybe that's your girl.

               Brody runs toward Hendricks, Cassidy hesitates, then follows 

               with:

                                     CASSIDY

                              (pathetically)

                         You can't make me look -- !

               MASTER ANGLE - THE SAND DUNE

               A skein of seaweed garnishes the base of this isolated dune.

               The booming waves and fizzing surf make dialogue inaudible.

               Deputy Hendricks on hands and knees, looking white as a sheet.  

               Brody tells Cassidy to wait at the foot of the dune, and 

               ventures up. Hendricks stops him with a wave-off, saying 

               something at the same time. Brody nods understanding and 

               steps up cautiously and looks down. He adjusts his glasses, 

               trying to make sense of what he is looking at.

               Whatever he sees has a marked effect on his entire physique.

               Kicking out with his foot, Brody sends dozens of angry 

               horseshoe crabs into an escape frenzy and they boil over the 

               top of the dune and down its slopes.

               Cassidy takes a few uneasy steps backwards when Brody waves 

               him over. He shakes his head. An awkward moment. Then Cassidy 

               shuffles forward and up the few remaining feet, his eyes 

               looking everywhere but down. Brody says something else and 

               Cassidy shakes his head again, eyes out at sea. Brody puts 

               his hand gently around the quaking man's shoulder.

               Nodding, he starts to look down, an inch at a time. He looks.

               He, too, can't make out what it is at first. Then he 

               understands.

               The jolt that assaults Cassidy is not unexpected. He falls 

               backward in a sitting position as though shot. Nods yes -- 

               it's her. Brody turns and slides off the dune, stumbling 

               close. Hear his breathing. He looks around, envisioning the 

               week ahead of him....

               QUICK SHARP CUT

               Chrissie's remains, incomplete from the chest down, horribly 

               bitten. (NOTE: See Hooper's dialog in Sc. 91 for complete 

               description of corpse.)

               INT. BRODY'S OFFICE - DAY

               Brody walks through the door and enters his office, holding 

               a fizzing glass of Alka-Seltzer. Polly, his sixty-one year 

               old secretary follows close on his heels with her shorthand 

               pad of messages and reminders.

               In the outer office, Hendricks and Cassidy slump into chairs, 

               sipping from fizzing dixie cups.

               Brody dips into file drawers for the appropriate forms. He 

               gently turns on Polly, who is behind him.

                                     BRODY

                         If this is going to work, you've got 

                         to keep current stuff out here, and 

                         put 'closed' files in there. The 

                         'Pendings' stay on my desk, okay?

               Brody slips behind his typewriter, putting paper in the 

               machine with the effortless ease of years of practice. He's 

               obviously no stranger to paperwork. He touch types, hardly 

               ever looking down, checking his notes and listening with one 

               ear to Polly.

               He is affected by what he's seen, but there's work to be 

               done.

                                     POLLY

                         This is in no order of importance, 

                         Chief: There's a meeting on the Amity 

                         Town Council on Aging this Monday 

                         night, Bentoncourt Hall. The Fire 

                         Inspector wants you to go over the 

                         fireworks site with him before he 

                         catches the one o'clock ferry. Mainly, 

                         you have a batch of calls about that 

                         new Karate school.

               CLOSE - ACCIDENT REPORT

               Brody has just typed the girl's name. He skips the space for 

               Cause-of-Death, and just under it types the Next-of-Kin 

               information he has collected from her wallet.

                                     POLLY

                         Searle's Rent-a-Bike, the Rainy Ale, 

                         Tisberry's Hardware... they say it's 

                         those nine-year-olds from the school 

                         practicing karate on all those nice 

                         picket fences.

               The phone rings and Polly picks it up.

                                     POLLY

                         It's the Coroner. Somebody pass away 

                         in the night?

               Brody nestles the phone between ear and collar, listening, 

               as he turns to the typewriter.

                                     BRODY

                         Jesus, Santos.

               INSERT - ACCIDENT REPORT

               Cause-of-Death line rolls into place. The hammers punch out: 

               SHARK ATTACK.

               BRODY

               leans forward, staring at what he just wrote. Polly cocks 

               her head and removes the phone from his ear.

                                     POLLY

                         What's the matter?

               Brody takes a breath. A new resolve comes over him.

                                     BRODY

                         Polly, I want to know what water 

                         recreation is on for today.

                                     POLLY

                         Right this minute?

               Brody gets up and moves hastily toward the door.

               BRODY'S OUTER OFFICE

               Cassidy and Hendricks look up as Brody enters.

                                     BRODY

                              (To Hendricks)

                         Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' 

                         signs?

                                     HENDRICKS

                         We never had any. What's the problem?

               A local merchant comes through the door.

                                     LOCAL MERCHANT

                         Glad I caught you. There's a city 

                         truck with New Hampshire plates parked 

                         right in front of my...

               Brody pushes past him and out the door.

               EXT. AMITY MAIN STREET  DAY

               In the busy center of a town preparing for the big Fourth of 

               July weekend, Brody wends his way around sidewalk activity, 

               purpose and haste in each stride. As he turns a corner a 

               little man in a white smock emerges from the Funeral Parlor.

               This is Carl Santos, Amity's part-time coroner. Santos looks 

               both ways before crossing Colonial Drive.

               Brody passes Keisel's Bicycle Rental, navigating an awkward 

               course through an odd assortment of Schwinns that line the 

               sidewalk in front of a demolished white picket fence. Keisel 

               intercepts Brody on the run.

                                     KEISEL

                              (he stares at Brody's 

                              face)

                         Wait-a-minute.

                              (stares some more)

                         Glasses, right?

               Brody nods yes, and starts to move away, but Keisel holds on 

               to him.

                                     KEISEL

                         Look at those fences! Little guys 

                         about eight to ten years old. And 

                         look at this!

               He holds up bicycle. The bicycle's spokes are bent and broken 

               from some sort of blows.

                                     KEISEL

                         They did that with their bare hands.

                                     BRODY

                         Call me later in the day, okay, Harry?

               ANGLE - AMITY GAZETTE NEWSPAPER OFFICE - PORCH

               Santos emerges with Ben Meadows, the stylish, late-thirties 

               editor of the Amity Gazette. Together they cut a beeline for 

               the other side of the street.

               ANGLE - AMITY STREET

               Past taverns and chowder shacks, past bleacher construction 

               and July Fourth posters, Brody enters Hardware and Sporting 

               Goods... so overstocked that beach umbrellas, aluminum deck 

               chairs, and rainbow beach towels splash a surplus of color 

               from the display window to the sidewalk.

               INT. HARDWARE STORE  DAY

               The store proprietor is busy at work on an inventory list 

               with a mainland delivery man.

                                     LYNWOOD

                         Stuff's no good to me in August when 

                         the Pilgrims come in June...

                              (to Brody)

                         Go on and help yourself to whatever 

                         you need, Chief. Can you work the 

                         register?

               EXT. HARDWARE STORE AND STREET - DAY

               Brody emerges with enough poster-board, wooden stakes, nails, 

               paint, and brushes to close every beach on the island. He 

               starts back the way he came when Hendricks shoots up the 

               street in the patrol jeep. He stops fast enough to call 

               attention, leans out the window.

                                     HENDRICKS

                         Polly told me to tell you there's a 

                         scout troop in Avril Bay doing the 

                         mile swim for their Merit Badges. I 

                         couldn't call them in, there's no 

                         phone out there.

                                     BRODY

                              (hands him the sign 

                              material)

                         Get out of there  take these back 

                         to the office and make up some 'Beach 

                         Closed' signs, and let Polly do the 

                         printing.

                                     HENDRICKS

                         What's the matter with my printing?

               EXT. VAUGHN'S REALTY  DAY

               Revealing Larry Vaughn, the Mayor of Amity, exchanging 

               anxieties with Ben Meadows and Coroner Santos and two other 

               city Selectmen. They come out in a group, reach the sunlight, 

               and squint down the street as Brody careens around the corner 

               and out of sight. Deputy Hendricks, laden with his arts and 

               crafts, passes them on the street front.

                                     VAUGHN

                         What have you got there, Lenny?

                                     HENDRICKS

                         We had a shark attack at South Chop 

                         this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta 

                         batten down the beach.

               Vaughn and group exchange horrified looks, but we get the 

               impression it is not in response to the shark-attack news.

                                     VAUGHN

                         Who've you told this to, Lenny?

                                     HENDRICKS

                         I just found out about it -- but 

                         there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the 

                         water a coupla miles down the coast 

                         from where we found the girl. Avril 

                         Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry 

                         them off.

                                     VAUGHN

                              (to Meadows)

                         Take my car, okay?

                              (to Hendricks)

                         You come with us, Lenny.

                                     HENDRICKS

                         I've got all these signs here...

                                     VAUGHN

                         C'mon, it'll give us time to think 

                         about what they're going to say.

               They all crowd into a Cadillac El Dorado with Vaughn Realty 

               signs on the doors.

               EXT. AVRIL BAY - DAY

               A flotilla of twenty exhausted Boy Scouts round a buoy that 

               marks the official course. A rowboat with Scoutmaster using 

               a bullhorn keeps pace, and urges the boys on.

                                     SCOUTMASTER

                              (bullhorn effect)

                         Let's go, Robbie. You too, Hofner. 

                         Boyle, keep your head up. Alberts, 

                         keep kicking...

                              (etc., ad lib)

               EXT. ON THE BEACH AT AVRIL BAY - DAY

               Two older Seascouts look on with stop watches and clipboards, 

               while some Parents shade their eyes from the sun, watching 

               their offspring. Brody pulls up in the Amity Police jeep, 

               and starts toward the people. Behind him, Vaughn's Cadillac 

               pulls up and skids to a stop. In it are Vaughn, Meadows, the 

               Doctor, maybe a Selectman, and Hendricks, with his arms still 

               full of sign material. Vaughn intercepts Brody, the others 

               circle around him, effectively slowing his progress through 

               the sand to the scouts.

                                     VAUGHN

                         Martin!

                              (he catches up with 

                              him)

                         Are you going to shut down the beach 

                         on your own authority?

                                     BRODY

                         Do I need any more authority?

                                     MEADOWS

                         Technically, you need the instruction 

                         of a civic ordinance, or a special 

                         meeting of the town selectmen...

                                     VAUGHN

                              (the good guy)

                         That's just going by the book. We're 

                         just a little anxious that you're 

                         rushing into something serious here. 

                         This is your first summer.

                                     BRODY

                         Now tell me something I don't know.

                                     VAUGHN

                         All I'm saying is that Amity is a 

                         summer town -- we need summer dollars, 

                         and if they can't swim here, they'll 

                         use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long 

                         Island.

                                     BRODY

                         So we should set out a smorgasbord?

                                     MEADOWS

                         We're not even sure what it was.

                                     BRODY

                         What else could've done that?

                                     VAUGHN

                              (to Doctor)

                         Boat propeller?

                                     DOCTOR

                         I think, possibly... sure. A boating 

                         accident.

                                     VAUGHN

                         Some weekend tramp accidentally goes 

                         swimming too far, she's a little 

                         drunk, a fishing boat comes along --

                                     MEADOWS

                         Remember when Fred Ganz went 

                         scalloping in his BVD's? He was going 

                         to swim to New Bedford, he said.

               The men all laugh, ad lib their remembrances of this 

               foolishness.

                                     MEADOWS

                         ...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him 

                         in his net...?

                                     BRODY

                              (interrupting the 

                              merriment)

                         Doctor, you're the one who told me 

                         what it was!

                                     DOCTOR

                         I was wrong. We'll have to amend the 

                         report.

                                     MEADOWS

                         We never had that kind of trouble 

                         here.

                                     VAUGHN

                         I don't think you can appreciate the 

                         gut reaction people have to these 

                         things.

                                     BRODY

                         I was only reacting to what I was 

                         told.

               Brody looks out to the water where the scouts are rounding 

               another buoy on the home stretch.

                                     VAUGHN

                              (taking Brody aside)

                         It's all psychological, anyway. You 

                         yell 'Barracuda' and everyone says 

                         'huh'. You yell 'Shark' and we've 

                         got a panic on our hands. I think we 

                         all agree we don't need a panic this 

                         close to the 4th of July.

               Vaughn indicates the beach where the Scouts are flopping out 

               onto the sand, exhausted, glad to be finished.

                                     BRODY

                         I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't 

                         you make Hendricks Chief? His family's 

                         been here since the Puritans -- half 

                         this island are his cousins.

                                     VAUGHN

                         Martin, we hired the best man we 

                         could find.

               All ad lib agreement.

                                     VAUGHN

                         We need someone who isn't prejudiced 

                         by old feuds or family ties, someone 

                         who can referee things.

                                     MEADOWS

                         You have our complete support.

                                     VAUGHN

                         Now then. We've got a vandalism 

                         problem we ought to talk about...

               The others surround Brody as Vaughn leads the way back to 

               the cars, ad libbing their problem with the little karate 

               choppers.

               Hendricks puts the signs back into the trunk of Vaughn's 

               Cadillac. Vaughn waves casually to the Scouts and swimmers 

               who are vigorously toweling off in the background.

               EXT. AMITY STREET - DAY

               In front of Amity's only Music Store, a battered old pick-up 

               truck pulls in to the curb. Quint and his mate cross silently 

               heading into the music store.

               INT. AMITY MUSIC STORE - DAY

               A gently tinkling bell tolls Quint's entrance. Inside the 

               store, a ten-year-old boy is being shown a clarinet. He is 

               playing a mellow low tone, and running "Ode to Joy." Quint 

               looms past him like Neptune rising from the deep, and lets 

               his hand drop on the counter with a slap that sounds like a 

               club on flesh. The Shopkeeper abandons the little boy and 

               meets Quint.

                                     SHOPKEEPER

                         Hello, Mr. Quint.

                                     QUINT

                         Four spools of Number 12 piano wire, 

                         Okay? I ordered them.

                                     SHOPKEEPER

                              (finding them under 

                              the counter)

                         Yessir, right here. What do those 

                         fish do, eat this stuff?

                                     QUINT

                         They choke on it.

               Without waiting for it to be wrapped, he picks up the gleaming 

               wire in his gnarled fist, and drops a bill on the counter.

                                     SHOPKEEPER

                         Bye now.

               No answer from Quint, who stops and sings along with the 

               boy.

               The little kid's music degenerates into a series of awkward 

               squeaks and blurps, as Quint stares at him. Quint continues 

               out the door, threading his way through the people in the 

               street like some great fish. As he gets up into the cab of 

               his pick-up, its door swings open so we can see a crude 

               stylized shark decorating its side. It slams behind him as 

               Quint gets in and drives away.

               EXT. AMITY BEACH - DAY

               A plump jelly-bowl of a woman plunges into the ocean. There's 

               enough there to satisfy the most gluttonous shark. Buoyant, 

               joyful, she splashes away in abandon. From her, we pan off 

               to reveal other cheerful bathers enjoying that last 

               uncluttered weekend before the season starts in earnest.

               ANGLE ON THE WATERLINE

               A Man and his dog are romping at the water's edge. The Man 

               is throwing a stick out into the surf, the dog, a happy 

               retriever, is bounding into the waves after it.

               TWO YOUNG PEOPLE ON THE BEACH

               A Girl and her Boyfriend leave their blanket and run for the 

               water, playing tag, chasing each other, having a wonderful 

               time.

               ANGLE ON BIRTHDAY PARTY ON THE SAND - MARTIN AND ELLEN BRODY

               He is sitting stiffly in a beach chair, scanning the beach 

               with careful, cautious looks, eyeballing everything that's 

               going on.

               Around their particular blanket and umbrella are a number of 

               adults and their kids, the youngsters gathered to celebrate 

               Michael's birthday. Ellen is dishing out ice cream and cake 

               from a cooler chest to the raucous 10-year-olds. Michael's 

               hand is still bandaged.

                                     MAX TAFT

                              (an adult)

                         Looks like another big season. Gets 

                         worse every year.

                                     MRS. TAFT

                         And none of them from the Island. 

                         Just a lot of bother.

               Brody (and we) hear a shrill scream from the water. He 

               stretches to look past the group, to see what's happening 

               out there.

               BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW - THE WATER

               The young lady is disappearing under the water, pulled under 

               the waves by some force. She is shrieking. She pops right up 

               again riding the shoulders of her boyfriend, who pulled her 

               under. She's laughing hysterically. Brody is unamused.

               THE ADULTS

                                     BRODY

                              (to Taft)

                         What?

                                     TAFT

                         Present company excepted, but off-

                         islanders are a pain in the butt. 

                         Pardon my French.

               Ellen captures Sean, and holds him playfully, an example.

                                     ELLEN

                         What about this kid? What if he were 

                         born here. That make him an islander?

                                     TAFT

                         Just 'cause a cat has kittens in an 

                         oven, it don't make them muffins.

                                     SEAN

                         I'm not a muffin! I'm a boy!

               Brody rumples his hair and sets him off to play.

               ANGLE ON ANOTHER SMALL BOY, PLAYING ALONE

               It's Alex Kintner, and his mother, nearby, reading a novel.

               Alex is towing a funny rubber raft, and headed for the water.

                                     MRS. KINTNER

                         Alex! Alex Kintner! Where do you 

                         think you're going?

                                     ALEX

                         Water. Just once more, please?

                                     MRS. KINTNER

                         Let me see your fingers --

               He holds out his hands.

                                     MRS. KINTNER

                         They're beginning to prune. 10 minutes 

                         more.

               Alex starts for the ocean. Behind him, Michael and his gang 

               are also heading for the inviting waves. Brody is watching 

               them go, his spine rigid with tension.

               MAN AND HIS DOG

               As Alex and the boys hit the water, we see the man throwing 

               his stick into the waves, his dog swimming strongly after 

               it.

               BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW

               Out beyond the kids and the dog, the Fat Lady is bobbing 

               around, out way too far, isolated from the other swimmers.

               UNDERWATER VIEW - EXT. - DAY

               A fish's-eye view of the bathers: lots of little kicking 

               legs, rafts with tasty arms dangling in the blue, slowing 

               circling, favoring one raft (little Alex's). The Kintner 

               boy's legs and arms are kicking and paddling, producing 

               bizarre underwater vibrations of more than passing interest.  

               Dog goes by, dog-paddling along.

               ON THE BEACH

               Brody is half-rising, looking out over the water. The Fat 

               Lady is not where he remembered her. He scans the water 

               anxiously.

                                     ELLEN

                         Do you want the boys to come in? 

                         Honey, if you're worried...

               A Black Object swims across the water. It's the dog, breasting 

               against the surf.

               ANGLE ON THE WATER - BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW

               It's the Fat Lady, floating, relaxing. A black object swims 

               up to her. It's not the dog. It rears up out of the water.

               It's a man in a black bathing cap. They exchange distant 

               pleasantries, he strokes away.

               ANOTHER ANGLE - WATER

               Alex Kintner, paddling around, making boat sounds, tooting, 

               going "vroom, vroom."

               ANGLE ON THE BOY AND GIRL

               They kiss, embrace, kiss again. Strong stuff. They sink 

               beneath the waves, knotted in an embrace.

               ANGLE ON MICHAEL BRODY AND HIS FRIENDS

               He's trying to salvage a soggy piece of birthday cake, holding 

               it above the water, paddling with his other hand. The bandage 

               has come part way loose, and his cut is trailing in the water.

               BRODY AND ELLEN ON THE BEACH

               Ellen is rubbing suntan oil on his back, and he is allowing 

               himself to relax part way. His eyes still nervously scan the 

               beach in a constant surveillance. Mr. Keisel is coming out 

               of the water, toweling off vigorously, exclaiming to himself.

                                     BRODY

                              (to Keisel)

                         How's the water?

                                     KEISEL

                         Too cold. I'm going in again Labor 

                         Day. Hope we get this weather next 

                         weekend.

                                     ELLEN

                         You're very tight, y'know?

                              (digs in)

                         Right there.

                                     BRODY

                         Ow.

                              (he sees something)

                         He's gotta be more careful in the 

                         water...

               ANGLE ON THE GANG PLAYING IN THE WATER

               Michael has just been drenched. He splashes back. A big 

               waterfight ensues, the boys splashing and chopping at the 

               water, shouting battle cries and karate whoops. Alex is 

               paddling around near them, but not involved with them.

               ALONG THE WATERLINE ON THE BEACH

               The Man with the Dog is whistling into the ocean, looking 

               for his dog.

                                     DOG MAN

                         Buster! Hey, Buster! Here boy!

                              (whistles)

                         He continues to ad lib calling his 

                         dog, but there's no answer, no dog 

                         in the water.

               THE WATERFRONT

               A huge splash explodes in the water near the gang, an eruption 

               of foam and spray that stops everyone cold for a moment.  

               They stop to see who was responsible.

                                     A KID (MATHEW)

                         Hey, no fair splashing in the eyes!

               Before anyone can answer, another kid (P.J.) renews the 

               battle, whooping a karate cry, and slashing at the water 

               with his hand like a little kung-fu warrior, advancing through 

               the waves.

               CLOSE ON MATHEW, SPLASHING BACK

               He hits the water, which sprays up suspiciously pink. He 

               stares at it, surprised.

               CLOSE ON P.J.

               His hands are dripping deep pink, the red matting his hair, 

               running into his eyes. He looks down. The boys are surrounded 

               with a deep pink slick, their little bodies ringed by a 

               spreading stain of blood.

               ANGLE ON SHORE, A TOURIST AND HIS WIFE

               He's pointing frantically out to sea.

                                     TOURIST

                         Something in the water. Right there! 

                         Didn't anyone see it?

                                     WOMAN

                         There's blood in the water.

               ANGLE ON BRODY

               He leaps to his feet, nearly knocking Ellen over, and starts 

               for the water.

                                     ELLEN

                         What is it...?

               Brody is pelting towards the water. He kicks sand over an 

               annoyed Mrs. Kintner, who looks up, just in time to hear 

               Brody's bellow.

                                     BRODY

                         Michael! Sean! Out of the water. 

                         Everybody out of the water! Michael! 

                         Get out!

               His urgency communicates itself to the others. Ellen snatches 

               Sean up from where he's been playing in the sand. Other 

               parents are calling their kids, hysteria mounting. People 

               rush into the water, dragging their children and families 

               bodily out of the ocean. The first kids coming out of the 

               surf are frantically trying to wash the sticky blood off 

               their bodies. The sight of the red sends the beach into a 

               full panic.

               CLOSE ON BRODY

               He rushes into the water, up to his ankles, and suddenly 

               stops, unable to move into deeper water. He is urging Michael 

               out, holding his hands out to his son, who is slogging through 

               the surf towards his dad. He stands there immobilized by the 

               water, nervously helping people out of it onto the beach.

               ANGLE ON MICHAEL

               As he emerges from the water, Alex Kintner's raft washes in 

               behind him, ripped in half, the water pink, the foam spreading 

               the stain onto the sand as the wave breaks.

               ANGLE ON MRS. KINTNER

               Her voice rising into panic and hysteria with each unanswered 

               cry.

                                     MRS. KINTNER

                         Alex! Alex? Alex...!

               EXT - THE COUNTY COURTHOUSE AND COUNTY OFFICES - DAY

               We are looking at the closed double white front doors of the 

               building, through which we can hear a rolling boil of agitated 

               conversation. After a beat, they open to reveal Mrs. Kintner, 

               looking as though she has been visited by the wrath of God; 

               in effect, she has. Her eyes are puffy and swollen from 

               weeping, her clothing is put on and fastened awkwardly, her 

               gait is not normal. As she walks toward us, Quint enters 

               with his back to us, they pass without notice; Mrs. Kintner 

               moving out of sight, Quint leading us through the doors into 

               the town hall.

               INT. COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

               A crowd of angry men and women throng the central hallway, 

               their voices a babble of confusion. Many of them are gathered 

               around a roughly lettered notice that has been posted on the 

               town's official bulletin board. It reads.

               "A $3000 BOUNTY TO THE MAN OR MEN WHO CATCH AND KILL THE 

               SHARK THAT KILLED ALEX M. KINTNER ON SUNDAY, JUNE 29, ON THE 

               AMITY TOWN BEACH."

               Vaughn and Brody are on the outskirts of the crowd, which 

               includes Meadows, some selectmen, and others.

                                     BRODY

                         Look, I've got to talk to her. This 

                         isn't a contest we want the whole 

                         country entering.

                                     MEADOWS

                         I agree. If she's going to advertise, 

                         I wouldn't recommend out-of-town 

                         papers. Amity people could take care 

                         of this.

                                     BRODY

                         I'm responsible for public safety 

                         around here...

                                     VAUGHN

                         Then go out tomorrow and make sure 

                         no one gets hurt.

                              (addressing the crowd)

                         Everybody, could I have your 

                         attention? Since this affects all of 

                         us, I suggest we move into council 

                         chambers, where there's more room...

               There is a flurry and a bustle as everyone rearranges 

               themselves and makes their way into the Amity Selectmen's 

               Council Chambers.

               INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY

               The crowd is thronging into the large room. Already in the 

               room is a solitary figure, standing all the way in the rear, 

               watching everyone as they enter. Against the back wall is a 

               large blackboard used for town business during meetings.

                                     VAUGHN

                         Well, here we all are; anyone have 

                         any special questions?

                                     DENHERDER

                         Is that $3000 bounty on the shark in 

                         cash or check?

                              (laughter from all)

                                     VAUGHN

                         That's private business between you 

                         brave fishermen and Mrs. Kintner.

                              (to Brody)

                         -- Chief --

                                     BRODY

                              (stepping in)

                         I'd like to tell you what we're doing 

                         so far. These are some of the steps 

                         I've taken as Chief of Police...

                                     MEADOWS

                              (leading the direction 

                              of the discussion)

                         What's going on with the beaches, 

                         Chief?

               All react.

                                     BRODY

                         I'll get to that in a minute. First, 

                         I plan to start our seasonal summer 

                         help early, and to use shark spotters 

                         on beaches open to the sea. I'd like 

                         cooperation from local fishermen, 

                         and I've also contacted the 

                         Oceanographic Institute over on the 

                         mainland.

                                     VAUGHN

                              (Interrupting -- sotto 

                              voice to Brody)

                         No need to involve outsiders in our 

                         business, Martin.

                                     WOMAN

                         Are you going to close the beaches?

                                     BRODY

                         Larry and I have also decided to 

                         close the beaches for a short time.

               Pandemonium. A collective nerve has been touched.

                                     VAUGHN

                         Only 24 hours!

                                     BRODY

                         I didn't agree to that!

                                     MRS. TAFT

                         That official business could take 

                         all summer!

                                     MR. KEISEL

                         Maybe it's better to close.

               Two opinions have been expressed, and the crowd takes sides 

               vociferously, ad libbing assent or dissent depending on the 

               point of view held forth.

                     THOSE IN FAVOR

                         MR. WISEMAN

                 We should make sure 

                 there is no danger.

                         MR. HASSETT

                 I didn't raise my kids to be some 

                 fish's lunch! 

                                                       THOSE OPPOSED

                                                       MRS. TAFT

                                               The motel is all I own -- 

                                               you pull the plug on this 

                                               town and I go down the 

                                               drain with it.

                                                       MR. POSNER

                                               Nobody's seen a shark.

                                                       MR. POLK

                                               We'll lose business, we 

                                               lose taxes, we lose our 

                                               shirts!

               ANGLE ON QUINT, THE MAN IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM

               He has just run his large, coarse fingernails over the 

               blackboard. He is a large, rough man, a professional fisherman 

               marked by daily physical toil, About 45 or 50, it's hard to 

               tell where the scars leave off and the wrinkles begin. There 

               is a bit of the showman in him, as well as a bit of killer-

               whale.

                                     QUINT

                              (after taking a deep 

                              breath)

                         You all know me. You know what I do 

                         for a living. I'll go out and get 

                         this bird for you. He's a bad one 

                         and it's not like goin' down the 

                         pond chasing blue-gills and tommy-

                         cods. This is a fish that can swallow 

                         a man whole. A little shakin', a 

                         little tenderizing and down ya' go.

                              (a look to Vaughn)

                         You gotta get this fellow and get 

                         him quick. If you do, it'll bring a 

                         lot of tourist business just to see 

                         him and you've got your business 

                         back on a paying basis.

                              (beat)

                         A shark of that size is no pleasure 

                         and I value my neck at a hell of a 

                         lot more'n 3,000 bucks.

                              (a deadly look)

                         I'll find him for three. But I'll 

                         kill him for ten.

               Crowd reaction.

                                     QUINT

                              (he rises up)

                         The bastard is costing you more'n 

                         that every day. Do you wanna stay 

                         alive and annee up the ten or play 

                         it cheap and be on welfare next 

                         winter.

                              (a final moment)

                         I'm gonna kill this thing... just a 

                         matter of whether I do it now -- or 

                         at the end of summer.

                                     VAUGHN

                         Thank you very much, Mr. Quint, the 

                         Selectmen will take your offer under 

                         advisement

               INT. BRODY'S STUDY AT HOME - SUNSET

               A riffly blur, color alternating with black and white. The 

               dizziness stops on a book page showing a black and white 

               rendering of eight species of shark. The banner at the top 

               of the page reads: THE KNOWN AND REPUTED MANEATERS.

               The riffling begins again, stops on a grizzly photograph of 

               scar tissue on six former shark victims. Riffling -- stop.

               Photograph of five Ichthyologists posing on wooden stools, 

               framed by the enormous jaws of a prehistoric shark from the 

               family Carcharodon charcharias.

               BRODY

               his reading glasses reflecting a stack of twelve library 

               books, all on the subject of sharks and shark attacks. The 

               door opens and Ellen enters, quietly, in respect for Brody's 

               mood.

                                     ELLEN

                         Can you stand something to eat?

                                     BRODY

                         Love a cup of tea. With lemon.

               Ellen walks past Brody to the window and looks out the window 

               which overlooks the south bay. It is the hour of dusk.

                                     ELLEN

                         Mikey loves his birthday present.

                                     BRODY

                         Where is he?

                                     ELLEN

                              (with a slight laugh)

                         He's sitting in it.

               Brody gets up, concerned, and joins her at the window.

                                     ELLEN

                         Honey. He has it tied up to the jetty 

                         with a double-knot.

               BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW

               Michael is sitting in the boat, but two of his young school 

               chums are in the water, swimming around it. Brody opens the 

               window and calls down:

                                     BRODY

                         Son! -- Out of the water now!

                                     MICHAEL

                         My boat's neat, dad!

                                     BRODY

                              (turning to Ellen)

                         I want him out of the ocean.

                                     ELLEN

                         It's three feet deep, Martin

                                     BRODY

                              (angry now)

                         Michael! Come inside!

                                     ELLEN

                         It's his birthday present, and you 

                         closed the beach, Honey. I told him 

                         not to go in the water after what 

                         happened yesterday. I don't believe 

                         he'll ever do it again.

                                     BRODY

                         I told him not to go out until he 

                         memorized the handbook and the safety 

                         safety regulations, until he was 

                         sure of himself...

               Ellen's eyes drift down to the open book, which is displaying 

               a reproduction of the famous painting "The Gulf Stream," 

               showing a black fisherman in a small dinghy similar to 

               Michael's being assaulted by the jaws of three man-eating 

               sharks, circling his boat.

                                     ELLEN

                         You heard your father! Out right 

                         now!

               SUNSET ON THE BEACH

               Hendricks and another deputy are assisting Brody. Silhouettes 

               of townspeople look on like mourners at a funeral.

               In the background some workmen are taking down the shutters 

               from a quaint summer cottage. They pause to watch the 

               declining moments of the day.

               Three Selectmen also stand watching. One of them seems to be 

               whispering bounty news to three youngish men on a nearby 

               dune.

               Sounds: Surf and hammering.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OCEAN AND PIER - NIGHT

               Selectman Denherder and his buddy, Charlie, a professional 

               angler, row towards a tumble-down jetty that leads fifty 

               feet out into the black water.

                                     DENHERDER

                         You wanna call it a night after here?

                                     CHARLIE

                         It's only two-thirty. What, are you 

                         tired?

                                     DENHERDER

                         Yeah, Charlie, I got my second wind 

                         three nibbles back.

               Denherder hefts a bloodstained laundry bag from the 

               wheelbarrow, revealing about a hundred feet of coiled dog 

               chain and a large patched inner tube. Charlie takes out a 

               monster hook and together they push the wheelbarrow onto the 

               rickety pier that is only about five feet across.

                                     DENHERDER

                              (reaching into the 

                              bag)

                         Leg of lamb this time?

                                     CHARLIE

                         Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!

                                     DENHERDER

                              (a hyena laugh)

                         We're blowin' half the bounty on 

                         bait --

               The splintered pier sways to and fro as the men reach the 

               end and start to work. Charlie baits the hook with a massive 

               chunk of sirloin while Denherder secures the loose end of 

               chain to a skinny piling. Charlie then fastens the inner 

               tube to the chain five feet from the end of the hook.

                                     DENHERDER

                         One more after this, then I'm going 

                         home.

                                     CHARLIE

                         Set?

               Denherder tugs the chain against the piling to prove that it 

               is. Charlie heaves the bait. Splash! The inner tube follows 

               and both men eagerly watch as it floats seaward, the chain 

               playing out from the wheelbarrow.

                                     CHARLIE

                         Tide's taking it right out.

               Charlie lights his pipe and sits back against a piling. He 

               turns on his transistor radio and loops one end around a 

               fractured board. Denherder paces, bored to death.

                                     DENHERDER

                         You do this all the time, right, 

                         Charlie?

                                     CHARLIE

                         Twenty years.

                                     DENHERDER

                         I can't believe that people pay money 

                         to go fishing. This is really dumb. 

                         This isn't even relaxing... it's 

                         just boring.

               CLOSE - CHAIN IN WHEELBARROW

               Suddenly zipping out, faster and faster, as both men 

               straighten.

               Denherder is goggle-eyed.

                                     DENHERDER

                         Hey! What's this?

               The chain is coming out so fast that it begins to drag the 

               wheelbarrow to the end of the jetty. A section of chain 

               tangles around the handle and flips the entire machine into 

               the air. Both men watch dumbfounded as the inner tube, racing 

               out to sea in a wake of white water, suddenly dips under.

                                     CHARLIE

                         Look at him take it!

                                     DENHERDER

                         Do I set the goddam hook?

                                     CHARLIE

                         Let him do it! Go-go-go-go-go!

               It is then that the chain whips taut against the narrow 

               pilings.

               CLOSE - PILING

               A lineup of five decrepit 2 x 4 inch pilings SNAP with a 

               resounding CRACK.

               ANGLE - JETTY

               The end of the jetty is yanked loose. Denherder is flipped 

               like a chip over the side and into the cold night water, 

               where he manages to snag hold of a splintered timber.

               DENHERDER'S POINT OF VIEW

               The severed section of jetty, a joined platform of footboards, 

               is being dragged seaward with Charlie sitting dazed on top 

               of it, his lit pipe still going.

                                     DENHERDER

                         CHARLIE! JUMP!

               Charlie rolls into the water, sputters, turns to watch the 

               flotilla of wood draw away.

               CLOSE - CHARLIE

               looking seaward.

               CHARLIE'S POINT OF VIEW

               The end of the jetty makes a 180-degree turn and heads back 

               in his direction.

                                     CHARLIE

                         Holy Jesus Christ!

               Denherder steps up on the broken-off piling just to be out 

               of the water.

                                     DENHERDER

                         Get the hell out! Charlie! Swim!

               Charlie, inhaling terror, trying to slog to shore. The jetty 

               is getting closer. Suddenly, an enormous black fin breaks 

               water like a periscope, making course corrections as it comes 

               for Charlie.

               Denherder jumps from piling to piling, almost losing his 

               balance on his way to help Charlie. Charlie has reached the 

               last pylon toward open sea, and his hands clamber for a hold. 

               But --

               INSERT - CHARLIE'S HANDS

               The algae is too slippery, and his fingers keep sliding back.

               That's when the fin behind him seems to reach up to the sky 

               and Charlie manages, with Denherder's desperate help, to 

               make it safely to shore. The remains of the pier float belly-

               up in the inlet.

               CLOSE ON THE HARBORMASTER OF AMITY - DAY

               He is sitting on a little canvas folding chair, eating a 

               bowl of Cheerios with milk and sugar, watching a panorama of 

               ineptitude and greed unfold before his old seaman's eyes.

               The Amity Pier area is a minor madhouse: out-of-state cars 

               elbow local vehicles for parking space at the foot of the 

               dock, and a parade of bounty-hunting townspeople, islanders, 

               off-islanders, tourist, and others shout and push their way 

               onto the crowded pier, each carrying some bizarre or 

               appropriate tool for the real or imagined capture of an 

               unarmed shark of indeterminate size.

               Rods and reels, drop lines, crossbows, slingshots, harpoons, 

               shotguns, rifles, nets and tridents; every fishing supply 

               store and sporting goods house within a hundred miles has 

               been cannibalized to equip this weird array.

               ANGLE ON BRODY AND HENDRICKS ARRIVING ON THE SCENE

               Not having room to bring their police vehicle anywhere near 

               this mess, they are proceeding on foot into the confusion.

                                     HENDRICKS

                         ...So then Denherder and Charlie sat 

                         there trying to catch their breath, 

                         and figuring out how to explain to 

                         Charlie's wife what happened to her 

                         freezer full of meat.

                                     BRODY

                         That wasn't funny.

               Some of the locals greet Hendricks with occasional nods of 

               recognition, or an ad libbed "Hi, Lenny," or "Hey, Lenny."

                                     HENDRICKS

                         Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad in 

                         Field and Stream.

                                     BRODY

                         Looks more like the readers of the 

                         National Enquirer.

               ANGLE ON BOAT RENTAL - PIER

               An argument is in progress between and Out-of-Towner and the 

               Boat Rental Man.

                                     OUT-OF-TOWNER

                         You're charging me double the usual 

                         rent! I didn't come up here all the 

                         way from New Rochelle to be gouged 

                         by some Yankee Cracker!

                                     BOAT RENTAL MAN

                         Prices go up June First every year. 

                         You want a nice cheap, leaky boat, 

                         you go down to the Hamptons.

                              (he sees Brody)

                         Right, Chief?

               ANGLE LOOKING OUT TO SEA

               Making its way through the channel towards the dock is a 

               sleek, expensive runabout with the name "Fascinatin' Rhythm" 

               on the stern. It's professionally handled, and rumbles in as 

               it coasts in towards the dock area. Some other boats clear 

               the way for it, zig-zagging in the harbor, causing an annoying 

               chop.

               CLOSE ON BOAT

               Matt Hooper, a bearded, bespectacled young man with an intent 

               look, is maneuvering the vessel peering through his windscreen 

               at the ragtag collection of seafaring loonies all around 

               him.

               BACK TO DOCKSIDE

               Hendricks is mediating the argument between the two men, and 

               we can hear a plaintive "But Lenny," from the local as Brody 

               sees something that makes him move towards the other side of 

               the dock. We see him cross to a little boat built for two or 

               three that is settling low in the water as a seventh man 

               climbs in with his gear.

                                     BRODY

                         Hey! You know how many men that's 

                         supposed to hold?

                                     MAN IN BOAT (WALTER)

                         Whatever's safe, right?

                                     BRODY

                         What you got ain't safe. You take 

                         some guys off or you don't go out.

               BEN GARDNER AND HIS BOAT, FLICKA

               Matt Hooper is gliding into the dockside, and Ben throws him 

               a line to help make fast as he moors. It's a small island of 

               courtesy in an otherwise discourteous mob. Hooper nods 

               politely as he ties his boat up and steps onto the dock.

                                     HOOPER

                         Hello.

                                     GARDNER

                         Hello, back.

               He's standing near where Brody is finishing after his 

               encounter with the chummers.

               Brody approaches Ben Gardner.

                                     BRODY

                         You going out too, Ben?

                                     GARDNER

                         Might give it a try. That three 

                         thousand bounty beats working for a 

                         living.

                              (yells to his Mate)

                         We ready?

               The Mate nods "Yes" and starts to prepare to get under way.

               Ben and his Mate move away from the dock, headed towards the 

               channel and the open sea leaving Felix and Pratt to scamper 

               around the dock looking for another ride.

               ANOTHER DOCK AREA, CLOSE BY

               A particularly awkward moment between a small sailboat and a 

               couple of powerboats. The sailboat is trying to hoist sail 

               to make it away from the pier under sail, a real yachtsman's 

               conceit, since Hornblower himself probably couldn't navigate 

               through this mess. Brody, a landlubber for sure, is trying 

               to direct traffic to untangle this new mess.

                                     BRODY

                         Just back up! No, the other way! Cut 

                         it to your left! Your other left! 

                         The big boat, your front end is out 

                         way too far. Little boat, stay still!

               Amidst all this, we can hear the angry shouts of the entangled 

               crews.

                                     SKIPPER 1 (THE SAILBOAT)

                         Dammit, a vessel under sail has the 

                         right of way!

                                     SKIPPER 2 (MOTORBOAT)

                         You schmuck, you ain't under sail, 

                         you're goddam drifting!

                                     HOOPER

                              (stepping in to help)

                         Ahoy, sail! You got an oar? Well, 

                         scull it out!

                                     SAILBOAT SKIPPER

                         Tell that stinkpotter to belay!

                                     MOTORBOAT SKIPPER

                         Tell that ragsetter I'm going to 

                         poke him in the snoot!

                                     HOOPER

                         Just cast off in turn and make for 

                         the channel, OK?

                                     BRODY

                         Thanks.

               Brody starts back towards the shore, Hooper is by his side.

                                     HOOPER

                         Excuse me, I wonder if you could 

                         tell me...

               Before he can finish, Brody spots something on shore that 

               moves him to shout to his deputy.

                                     HOOPER

                              (noticing something)

                         Is that dynamite?

               Brody looks, and stops by a boat that's about to cast off.

               He holds out his hand.

                                     BRODY

                         If that's dynamite, give it here, or 

                         don't leave port.

                                     MAN

                         Aw, c'mon, it's just fireworks. Sharks 

                         like fireworks, it attracts them.

                                     BRODY

                         Hand it over.

               The man passes Brody a cigar box filled with dynamite sticks.

               Brody tucks the dynamite under his arm, and continues down 

               the pier. Hooper is still with him.

               All around them are two distinctly different breeds; the 

               quiet pros, like Ben Gardner, in well-worn, comfortable 

               clothes, with efficient, sensible gear, and the amateur 

               crazies, with all manner of weapons and impractical, silly 

               tourist clothing.

               INT. DOCK SHED - DAY

               Brody is on the phone, talking to his office, trying to get 

               Hendricks' attention. He throws a handful of washers at the 

               window.

                                     HOOPER

                         There's a fantail launch out there 

                         that won't make it beyond the 

                         breakwater.

                                     BRODY

                         You're tellin' me. I swear, this 

                         town has gone crazy.

                                     HOOPER

                         Officer, I wonder if you could tell 

                         me where I could find Chief Brody?

                                     BRODY

                         Who are you?

                                     HOOPER

                         Hooper, Matt Hooper. From the 

                         Oceanographic Institute.

                              (holds out his hand)

               EXTERIOR - OCEAN - DAY

               Ben Gardner's boat is in the lead with Gardner's shouting 

               derisive comments at the crowd headed out from land. The 

               armada is spread out and moving in a ragged circle, fifteen 

               boats in all. One man heaves cherry bombs into the water. A 

               smaller boat going in the opposite direction offers us 

               Barwood, forking spaghetti leftovers into the ocean while 

               his friend pours out a bottle of ketchup.

               A speedboat chugs by, one of the occupants reading 

               instructions aloud from a book entitled "Sharks - East Coast, 

               Vol. I."

               boatload of impoverished scallop fishermen throw a net 

               overboard, full of gaps and split ends. The professionals 

               look professional, but the landlubbers out for the $3000 

               make it impossible for everybody. Collisions are barely 

               averted.

               THE RUBE GOLDBERG ERROR

               The Out-of-Towner in a small boat is bent over in a life and

               death struggle, his rod in a tight arc. His buddy leaps across 

               to lend a hand.

               Twenty yards away in another boat the same struggle ensues.

               This time it's the overloaded boat with the poor scallop 

               fishermen. Shouts of I'M ON! DIG IN! STRIKE! Then a tangle 

               of tackle springs from the water. They have hooked each other.

               Joy turns to swearing.  Arnold Felix stands up to applaud 

               the mishap, while his buddy Pratt takes careful aim with his 

               Remington 1100 12-gauge and blasts at the tackle as if it 

               were a clay pigeon.  The tangle explodes --

               Both the Out-of-Towners and the Scallop Fisherman falls over 

               backward --

               ANGLE - HARRY'S BOAT

               Three men are aboard, one holding a rod which holds a fast 

               arc. A few yards off stern we see a triangular dorsal fin 

               crossing back and forth, struggling, jerking, the mighty 

               tail threshing. One man is screaming success, the other two 

               slapping the angler on the back.

               CLOSE - PRATT AND FELIX

               They spot it and sour.

                                     PRATT

                         Well, get over there! He ain't caught 

                         it yet!

               The owner of Pratt's boat throws it forward and Pratt removes 

               a .45 automatic from the holster of his belt. He tests it, 

               firing once in the air. As they near the scene of the 

               struggle, eleven other boats begin converging, until --

               HARRY'S BOAT

               Everyone wants to get into the act. They are attacking the

               threshing beast with all they've got. Pratt uses his 

               automatic, another blasts point blank with a shotgun. There 

               are occasional water ricochets and the bounty hunters duck 

               from time to time as bullets skip by. Finally, the shark 

               stops threshing.

               FELIX AND PRATT

               Their boat has moved close to the shark, closer than Harry's.

                                     PRATT

                              (exultant)

                         Hand me that pole! Quick!

               One of his party in the over-filled boat grabs a gaff and 

               leans out to grab the moribund shark. But Harry won't give 

               up the line, still reeling in.

                                     HARRY

                         Beat it! I hooked him!

                                     PRATT

                         How's the family, Harry?

                              (to the man with gaff)

                         Go on and do it!

                                     MAN WITH GAFF

                         We split down the middle?

               Pratt nods reluctantly. The man swings, lodges the gaff and 

               hauls the shark up onto the gunwale. A paroxysm of cheers 

               from the surrounding boats. Smoke flares are fired into the 

               air.

                                     HARRY

                              (a tug-of-war)

                         Let go my shark!

               It is a ten-foot tiger, and what a mess -- splattered with 

               bullet punctures, gashes, bleeding from several orifices. 

               But it is not dead -- it kicks back to life and threatens to 

               capsize the boat. Pratt panics and fires six times with his 

               .45. The bullets pierce the shark's head, pass through, and 

               split the fiberglass hull through which a flood of water 

               rises. Everybody stands up as the boat slips beneath them.

               INT. MORGUE - DAY

               The Amity Morgue is also the Amity Funeral Home, a Victorian 

               house that normally serves as the community's mortuary. The 

               Coroner, a professional small-town GP, is standing by as 

               Hooper is speaking into a sophisticated cassette recorder 

               with a headpiece that leaves his hands free for measurement 

               with a calibrator or calipers.

                                     BRODY

                         Let's show Mr. Hooper our accident.

               With a shrug, the Coroner slides open the drawer.

               CLOSE ON HOOPER

               He is looking down as the drawer slides past him, still matter-

               of-fact, turning on his recorder.

                                     HOOPER

                         Victim One, identified as Christine 

                         Watkins, female Caucasian...

               The sheet has just been lifted, and Hooper stares down at 

               the lump on the slab. He stops, turns off his recorder as 

               emotions wage war with his senses. Rationality wins, and he 

               turns on the recorder again.

                                     HOOPER

                         ...height and weight may only be 

                         estimated from partial remains. Torso 

                         severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated 

                         with no major organs remaining. May 

                         I have a drink of water? Right arm 

                         severed above the elbow with massive 

                         tissue loss from upper musculature. 

                         Portions of denuded bone remaining.

                              (tense, to Brody)

                         -- did you notify the coast guard?

                                     BRODY

                         No, it was local jurisdiction.

                                     HOOPER

                         Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum 

                         and portions of ribcage intact.

                              (to Brody)

                         Please don't smoke. With minor post-

                         mortem lacerations and abrasions. 

                         Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy 

                         feeding pattern of large squali, 

                         possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or 

                         isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss 

                         and post-mortem erosion of bite 

                         surfaces prevent detailed analysis; 

                         however, teeth and jaws of the 

                         attacking squali must be considered 

                         above average for these waters.

                              (to Brody again)

                         -- Did you go out in a boat and look 

                         around?

                                     BRODY

                         No, we just checked the beach...

                                     HOOPER

                              (turns off the recorder)

                         It wasn't an 'accident,' it wasn't a 

                         boat propeller, or a coral reef, or 

                         Jack the Ripper. It was a shark. It 

                         was a shark.

               EXT. DOCK AREA - DAY

               We open close on ugly, open shark's jaws, still oozing blood 

               and gore. As the shark is hoisted up into the air on a gin-

               pole hoist dockside, Meadows is seen passing with his 

               secretary and a photographer from the Amity Gazette. A crowd 

               of returning fishermen from the Armada and townspeople are 

               gathering around the fish as it is hoisted tail-up into the 

               classic sports fisherman's trophy shot.

                                     MEADOWS

                         Ginny, get this out on the state 

                         wire to AP and UPI in Boston and New 

                         York. Have one of them pick it up 

                         for the national and call Dave Axelrod 

                         in New York and tell him this is 

                         from me and he owes me one... let's 

                         get a picture.

               As he and the photographer turn to mob, we see Hooper and 

               Brody arriving from the morgue. Hooper immediately heads 

               towards the shark, while Brody pauses and we see a look of 

               relief and delight cross his features.

                                     HOOPER

                         Well, if one man can catch a fish in 

                         50 days, then I guess 50 of these 

                         bozos can catch a fish in one day -- 

                         beginner's luck.

                                     BRODY

                              (crossing to men around 

                              shark)

                         You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch 

                         this?

               Men ad lib "No, I caught it..." "I hooked him," etc.

                                     MEADOWS

                         Okay, everybody, I want to get a 

                         picture for the paper -- could 

                         everyone clear out of the way?

               He continues to call directions and move people out of the 

               way to set up his shot. Hooper is measuring the shark.

                                     MEADOWS

                         Could you get out of the shot, young 

                         man?

                                     HOOPER

                         Who, me? Okay...

                              (he drifts off)

               The men (Felix, Pratt, et al) get Brody to join them in the 

               shot. The whole town and the Armada fishermen all line up in 

               a classic "high school" graduating class shot with the 

               victorious fishermen kneeling in front, and the rest of the 

               Armada and Townspeople arranged behind them. Hendricks hold 

               up the "Beach Closed" sign in ironic victory.

               ANGLE SHOWING VAUGHN APPROACHING THE DOCK

               Brody spots the Mayor coming towards the dock, and detaches 

               himself from the group to join him.

                                     BRODY

                         Larry, if you'd see these clowns 

                         leave, you'd never believe they'd 

                         come back with anything. But they 

                         got him!

                                     VAUGHN

                         That's good. That's real good. Ben 

                         Meadows getting pictures for the 

                         paper.

                                     BRODY

                         Sure he is.

               HOOPER AND THE FISHERMEN

               The men who landed the monster are in a tight cluster, 

               debating something with Hooper, who is dwarfed by the big 

               beer bellies and ham-fisted hands all around him. It's 

               probable we don't even see him.

               The Men ad lib "What kind of shark is this?" "It's a shark 

               like in the movies they got sharks." "It's a man-eater, for 

               sure." "I bet it's a record-breaker," etc.

                                     HOOPER (O.S.)

                         It's a tiger shark. Very rare in 

                         these waters, and definitely a 

                         maneater.

               Hooper enters the circle, and picks up where he left off, 

               measuring the shark's teeth. Others watch him. Charlie and 

               Denherder walk over to the shark. Charlie punches it.

               BRODY AND VAUGHN

               They are walking down to the shark together.

                                     VAUGHN

                         Who's that young man?

                                     BRODY

                         Matt Hooper, the specialist they 

                         send down from the Oceanographic 

                         Institute.

                                     VAUGHN

                              (speaking to everyone)

                         I think we all owe a debt of gratitude 

                         to these men for catching this 

                         monster.

               Brody and Vaughn are by now near the circle of fishermen, 

               who are surrounding Hooper, raising their voices at him.

                                     PRATT

                         Whadya mean, 'Bite Radius?' What's 

                         that?

                                     GAFFER

                         Teeth are teeth, right?

                                     HOOPER

                         I didn't say this wasn't the shark, 

                         I just said I wasn't sure this was 

                         the one...

                                     BRODY

                         What d'ya mean?

                                     HOOPER

                         There are hundreds of different kinds 

                         of sharks; makos, blues, hammerheads, 

                         white-tips... any one of them could've 

                         attacked. Look -- shark digestion is 

                         slow. We could open this one up, and 

                         find whatever he's been eating is 

                         still inside.

                                     VAUGHN

                         That's disgusting! This is the 

                         largest, meanest, most vicious shark 

                         ever landed off Amity Island, and a 

                         known maneater!

                                     HOOPER

                         Let's just cut him open and see what's 

                         inside...

                                     BRODY

                         Why not, Larry? We could get a 

                         positive confirmation that way.

                                     VAUGHN

                         Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't 

                         the time or the place to do some 

                         kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. 

                         Ben...

                              (to Meadows)

                         do you have all the pictures you 

                         need?

                                     MEADOWS

                         Plenty.

                         Wait a minute...

               Felix, Pratt and the others ad lib disagreement. "You're not 

               gonna cut up my trophy," etc.

                                     VAUGHN

                              (seeing something 

                              offstage, with low 

                              intensity)

                         I am not going to stand here and 

                         watch this fish cut open and see 

                         some kid fall out on the dock. 

                         Besides...

                              (he indicates off)

               We see Mrs. Kintner approaching, dressed in black.

                                     VAUGHN

                              (to Brody)

                         Chief, I'll take responsibility for 

                         this. Boys, cut this ugly sonofabitch 

                         down before he stinks up the whole 

                         island. Harve, tomorrow you and Carl 

                         take him out and dump him right in 

                         the drink.

               MRS. KINTNER JOINS THE GROUP

               She seeks out Brody, and stops in front of him.

                                     MRS. KINTNER

                         Chief Brody?

               He nods, she slaps him full across the face. There is an 

               embarrassed silence. Some people leave, following a trend 

               that began with the first mention of cutting open the shark.

                                     MRS. KINTNER

                         My Alex was a beautiful little boy 

                         and you killed him. Did you know 

                         that? You knew there was a shark out 

                         there. You knew a girl got killed 

                         here last week. I just found that 

                         out. But you knew. You knew it was 

                         dangerous, but you let people go 

                         swimming anyway. You knew all those 

                         things, and still my boy is dead now 

                         and there's nothing you can do about 

                         that. My boy is dead. I wanted you 

                         to know that.

               She stops, unable to continue. Her father takes her arm and 

               leads her away. Pratt, Harry and the others trail off after 

               her. During the rest of the scene, the camera tightens in on 

               Brody to the exclusion of the others.

                                     VAUGHN

                         I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick, 

                         terrible state.

                                     HOOPER

                         Look, maybe this is the wrong time 

                         to pursue this, but I'm not sure...

               Before Hooper can finish, Brody's shoulders slump and he 

               goes slack.

                                     BRODY

                              (almost to himself)

                         She's right.

                                     VAUGHN

                         Let's all get out of here, this place 

                         stinks.

                                     BRODY

                         I'm going home.

               He turns and leaves abruptly, surrendering the dock to Vaughn 

               and Hooper, who eye each other with mutual dis-admiration.

               INT. BRODY HOUSE - NIGHT - DINING ROOM

               Brody and Ellen, Sean and Michael, have all finished dinner.

               Brody's plate is untouched, a virgin meatloaf. His glass, on 

               the other hand, is well used, with the remnants of a stiff 

               scotch and ice. He is staring across the table at the 

               youngest, Sean, who makes a face at him. He makes a face 

               back.

               They play this game together for a few minutes.

                                     BRODY

                         C'mere and give Daddy a kiss.

                                     SEAN

                         Why?

                                     BRODY

                         Because he needs it.

               Sean gives Daddy the kiss. Brody shoos him and Michael off 

               to bed. Ellen, who is feeling progressively more left out 

               with each passing moment, gets up abruptly and clears a few 

               dishes. Brody is not letting her into his world for the 

               moment, and it shows. There's a knock at the door.

                                     HOOPER (O.S.)

                         Martin Brody residence?

               Ellen opens the door for him.

                                     HOOPER

                         Hi. I'm Matt Hooper. If your husband 

                         is here, I'd like to talk to him.

                                     ELLEN

                         So would I. Come on in.

               Hooper enters. He's carrying a couple of bottles of wine 

               which he picked up in town. He sits down near Brody.

                                     ELLEN

                         Would you like something? Some coffee?

                                     HOOPER

                              (seeing Brody's plate)

                         Is anyone having this...?

               He starts in on it, as soon as someone has indicated "go 

               ahead."

                                     HOOPER

                         Dynamite!

                              (to Brody)

                         How was your day...?

                                     BRODY

                         Swell.

               They exchange a long look that evolves into a slightly 

               desperate, but shared laughter.

                                     HOOPER

                              (producing wine)

                         Here... one red, one white.

               They laugh some more. Ellen is again left out of it.

                                     HOOPER

                              (boning his fish)

                         Ummm. Really good.

               Brody begins stripping the foil off the wine, screwing in a 

               corkscrew, etc.

                                     ELLEN

                         My husband tells me you're in sharks.

                                     HOOPER

                         I wouldn't put it that way. But I 

                         love sharks.

                                     ELLEN

                         You love sharks?

                                     HOOPER

                         I do.

                              (he tells a story 

                              about his boyhood 

                              and a shark)

                         But you've still got a problem here, 

                         there's a shark just off the island 

                         somewhere.

                                     BRODY

                         How come you have to tell them that?

                                     ELLEN

                         Excuse me, but what are you talking 

                         about? Didn't they catch the shark 

                         this afternoon? It was on the Cape 

                         station news.

                                     HOOPER

                         They caught a shark, not the shark. 

                         Big difference. I could've proved it 

                         this afternoon, by cutting that one 

                         open and examining his stomach 

                         contents. Also, his bite was too 

                         small.

               Brody has the cork out of the wine. Pop.

                                     HOOPER

                         I was lucky to find that in town -- 

                         it's an estate bottled vintage year...

               Brody takes the fine wine, and pours it into his drink glass 

               filling the tumbler to the top with ice cubes, diluted scotch, 

               and the wine.

                                     HOOPER

                              (as Brody pours)

                         We ought to let it breathe... 

                         Whatever.

                                     BRODY

                         Let's all have a drink.

               He extends the bottle to Hooper, who politely accepts a token 

               sip. He takes some for himself, and offers some to Ellen.

                                     BRODY

                         You too, sweetheart...

                                     ELLEN

                         Thank you.

                                     HOOPER

                              (toasting)

                         Here's to your husband, the only 

                         other rational man on the island. 

                         Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone, 

                         and he'll be the only one.

                                     ELLEN

                         You're leaving?

                                     HOOPER

                         Going out on the 'Aurora.'

                                     ELLEN

                         Is that a boat?

                                     HOOPER

                         Is it! The best-funded research 

                         expedition to ever study the shark... 

                         around the world in 18 months.

                                     ELLEN

                         Like those Cousteau specials on 

                         television? I think it's for the 

                         kids, but I love them.

                                     HOOPER

                         Better than Cousteau, or Compagno 

                         with computers, telemetry, Defense 

                         Department funding...

                                     ELLEN

                         I saw a show with sea otters, and a 

                         big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made 

                         me promise to get him one. Will you 

                         live on the boat?

                                     HOOPER

                         Yep.

                                     ELLEN

                         Martin hates boats. Hates the water. 

                         On the ferry to the mainland, he 

                         sits in the car the whole way over. 

                         He's got this childhood thing, there's 

                         a clinical word for it.

                                     BRODY

                         Drowning. Lemme ask you something. 

                         Is it true most attacks take place 

                         in three feet of water, around 10 

                         feet from the beach?

                                     HOOPER

                         Yeah. Like the kid on your beach.

                         I wish I could've examined that shark 

                         they caught...

                                     BRODY

                         Something else. Do most attacks go 

                         unreported?

                                     HOOPER

                         About half of them. A lot of 'missing 

                         swimmers' are really shark victims.

                                     BRODY

                         There's a kind of a lone shark, 

                         called, uh...

                                     HOOPER

                         Rogue?

                                     BRODY

                         Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where 

                         there's food and hangs out there as 

                         long as the food supply lasts?

                                     HOOPER

                         It's called Territoriality. It's a 

                         theory.

                                     BRODY

                         And before 1900, when people first 

                         starting swimming for recreation, 

                         before public bathing and resorts, 

                         there were very few shark attacks, 

                         cause sharks didn't know what they 

                         were missing?

                                     HOOPER

                         You could say that.

               Brody digests all this; confirmation of facts he has gleaned 

               in his newly acquired knowledge of the shark species.

               There is a long pause.

                                     BRODY

                         Why don't we have one more drink, 

                         you and I, and then we go down and 

                         cut open that old shark and see for 

                         sure what's inside him, or not.

                                     ELLEN

                         Can you do that?

                                     BRODY

                         I am Chief of Police. I can do 

                         anything I want.

                              (to Hooper)

                         You want to come?

                                     HOOPER

                         I'm flattered you should ask.

               He gets up and they both start out. Ellen watches them go.

               INT. BOAT SHED - NIGHT

               Dark, spooky shed, with shadows of boats and strange 

               silhouettes of boat parts and scaffolding. At one end, the 

               large, symmetrical bulk of the shark's carcass lies on a 

               tarp. A single dark figure is bending over the dead shark.

               The large double doors at one end of the shed squeak open, 

               and the Shadowy Figure moves abruptly away from the shark.

               The new entrants move into the shed. It is Hooper and Brody 

               and they are continuing the conversation begun in the car on 

               the way over.

               As the Shadowy Figure moves silently into a vantage point 

               against one wall, he passes through the light from a window; 

               it is Quint, and we only see him long enough to recognize 

               him as he backs against the wall.

                                     HOOPER

                         ...And it was Dartmouth Winter 

                         weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, 

                         and I was her date; then she got 

                         into the fact that her family had 

                         more money than my family, and she 

                         was right -- her great-grandfather 

                         was in mining, and my ancestors were 

                         Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up 

                         and I went home with some beatnik 

                         from Sarah Lawrence.

               They bend over the shape like 18th century graverobbers.

                         We always had a summer place on the 

                         water -- Newport, the Vineyard, so I 

                         figured I'd major in something I 

                         knew about. Oceanography, marine 

                         biology. It was that, or design racing 

                         yachts like my older brother. Hmmm. 

                         He we go. Up the old alimentary canal. 

                         Hold the light.

               We hear a slurp and a squish as Hooper produces a big knife 

               and dips into the shark with a major incision.

                         cans of the ocean. They eat anything. 

                         But this one didn't eat any people. 

                         There's nothing here...

                         don't look on land. You go out and

                         Only one sure way to find him -- 

                         offer him a little something to eat. 

                         Chum -- blood, waste meat, fish, 

                         anything. They can sense it miles 

                         away. If he's out there, we might be 

                         able to get a closer look at him.

                              (checks his watch)

                         It's a good time, too. They're night 

                         feeders...

               EXT. ABOARD HOOPER'S BOAT - NIGHT (TANK)

               We see Brody, looking sick and nervous, holding on anxiously 

               as the "Fascinatin' Rhythm" moves slowly ahead trolling at 

               night. His glasses are already flecked with the white salt 

               of dried seawater. He is wearing a life-preserver.

               Hooper is at the wheel, a chart spread in front of him, his 

               eyes scanning the sea restlessly, checking the dials and 

               gauges in front of him as well as the electronic depth-finding 

               and "fish-finder" gear mounted in the cockpit. A green glow 

               shines from the instruments on his face. Two closed-circuit 

               TV cameras mounted below the hull flash their pictures onto 

               monitors in the dash.

               In the aisle between the seats is a large container filled 

               with unpleasant-looking bait; Hooper is long-lining for signs 

               of shark, and chumming.

                         the stretch where he's feeding, if 

                         he's still here.

               Brody, bored, tired, and slightly queasy, is trying to 

               concentrate on anything but the motion of the boat. He stares 

               at the sophisticated electronics displays.

               Hooper looks up and cuts the wheel hard, as the same time

               loose debris floating around, a tangle of lines and gear 

               looking like floating garbage in the cockpit. Hooper's light 

               sweeps across it.

               Hooper cuts his engines and drifts in; he scampers out to 

               the bow of his boat and makes a line fast to the Flicka.

               INSIDE THE COCKPIT OF HOOPER'S BOAT

               The electronic display is showing increased activity, but 

               only Brody, who is clinging to a support for dear life, can 

               see the blips and hear the chatter. Hooper is leaning out to 

               look at the Flicka.

               The light picks its way across the ruined boat. The rail 

               where a cleat once was is broadly scarred down to the raw 

               timber, and the heady cleat has been torn bodily out of the

               death-grip.

               Hooper goes below decks, getting into his wet suit, buckling 

               on a weighted belt, holding a mask and hot flashlight.

               UNDERWATER SEQUENCE - HOOPER

               Hooper descends in a froth of bubbles. Warily he turns a 

               full circle with his hotlight. At first we see nothing out 

               of place about the Flicka except that it is lying so low in 

               the water. But as Hooper travels the bottom looking for 

               damage, he comes across a jagged hole two-thirds of the way 

               forward.

               The hole is about the size of a basketball, and the wood 

               around it has been bashed and splintered. Hooper explores 

               the hole with his hands, then takes the knife from its sheath 

               and begins to dig at something. Whatever it is comes free in 

               his hand. As he studies his find, his light wanders upward, 

               pointing directly into the dark hole. Hooper looks up...

               own boat, shocked, dismayed, his system jangling with 

               adrenaline shock, his hands open, and the object he pried 

               loose from the hull drifts down and out, falling into the

               Hooper, despite his shock and surprise, is strangely elated, 

               almost giddy with the wonder of his discovery.

                                     HOOPER

                         Jesus Christ! A Great White! Who'd 

                         believe it! We're not talking about 

                         a shark, we're talking about a Shark!

               Brody sinks weakly into a chair. Brody huddles in the stern, 

               Hooper kicks the engine in with a roar, and still a-shiver 

               with excitement, turns the boat and its grim tow back to 

               port.

               EXT. ISLAND HIGHWAY - THE BILLBOARD - DAY

               Next to the "Amity Welcomes You" billboard is a group of 

               selectmen, Vaughn, Meadows, Hendricks, and another deputy 

               standing by with paint and brushes. Brody's wagon is there, 

               along with a few other cars. Busy late afternoon traffic is 

               starting to pile up as early weekenders and curiosity seekers 

               slow down to see what's happening.

               Behind the billboard, Brody and Hooper have gotten Vaughn to 

               one side. They are making a closely reasoned presentation to 

               him.

                                     BRODY

                         There is a kind of shark called a 

                         Great White Shark that every expert 

                         in the world agrees is a maneater.

                                     HOOPER

                         You're situation here suggests that 

                         a Great White has staked out a claim 

                         in the waters around Amity Island, 

                         and that he will continue to feed 

                         here as long as there is food in the 

                         water.

                                     BRODY

                         There's no limits to where he can 

                         strike, and we've had three attacks 

                         and two deaths in the past few days. 

                         It happened like this before, in 

                         1916, when a Great White killed five 

                         swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long 

                         Island.

                         A shark's attack is stimulated by 

                         the kind of splashing and activity 

                         that occurs whenever humans go 

                         swimming -- you can't avoid it!

                         A 4th of July beach is like ringing 

                         a dinner bell, for Chrissake!

                         I just pulled a shark tooth the size 

                         of a shot glass out of the hull of a 

                         wrecked boat out there.

                         We towed Ben Gardner's boat in, Larry; 

                         he was dead and his boat was all 

                         chewed up.

                         it?

                         Well, I'm not going to commit economic 

                         suicide on that flimsy evidence. We 

                         depend on the summer people for our 

                         lives, and if our beaches are closed, 

                         then we're all finished.

                         We have got to close the beaches. We 

                         have got to get someone to kill the 

                         shark, we need non-corrosive mesh 

                         netting, we need scientific support... 

                         It's gonna cost money just to keep 

                         the nuts out and save what we have.

                         ass! There are only two ways to solve 

                         this thing: you can kill it, or you 

                         can cut off its food supply...

               He leads Brody around to the front of the billboard, on which 

               we see that some pranksters have painted a huge shark fin in 

               the water behind the swimmer, so she looks now like a frantic 

               bather fleeing a pursuing monster.

                         you have to to keep them safe, but 

                         with you or without you, the beaches 

                         stay open this weekend.

               INT. FERRY BOAT - DAY

               Two cavernous iron doors. Then a crack of vertical light as 

               six burly crewmen muscle them apart. The Amity ferry landing 

               is approaching, people in colorful outfits waiting dockside 

               for the first filled-to-capacity shuttle of the summer season 

               and --

               Bach's Little Fugue is the musical accompaniment to this 

               wholly visual montage of disembarkation. The next two minutes 

               should be treated like a "short film" taking into account 

               all of the colors, episodes, faces and behavior of a variety 

               of Americans who colonize Eastern resort communities for the 

               ninety-day season.

               Intercut with this montage is Brody's home, where Ellen, 

               Hooper and Brody are in sweaty, gritty all-out effort to 

               enlist some support. Elements in this montage include:

               A.  A train of cars trundling down the ramp, bumper to bumper.

               B.  Young Beautiful People from Princeton, Yale, NYU, wearing 

               knapsacks, toting luggage, babies riding in papoose rigs, 

               energized children, senior citizens holding hands on the 

               pedestrian ramp, a few wheelchairs.

               C.  Hooper, bent over the phone: "I know it's a long weekend, 

               could you get me his home phone number?

               D.  Sidewalk vendors hawking "Shark Killed" souvenirs, big 

               photo "Personality Posters" of the dead tiger shark hung on 

               the dock.

               E.  Brody: "You're acting senior officer? Where's Chief Petty 

               Officer Feldman? Where's the Coast Guard Executive Officer?"

               F.  Souvenir stands selling Genuine Sharks Teeth from The 

               Amity Killer Shark, Captured This Week.

               G.  Amity Cab Company, small blue Toyotas lined up with their 

               college student drivers like a bomber wing.

               H.  Hooper:  "Well then, operator, could you try him in the 

               dining room?"

               I.  Brody: "All I get is a recording. Is there some other 

               number I could try...?"

               J.  Station wagons with pale winter faces pressed anxiously 

               to the window. Cadillacs with Rear Admirals at the helm, 

               their wives with blue hair remembering the way from years 

               before.

               K.  Hooper: "When did he check out? Did he leave another 

               phone number?"

               L.  Brody: "How can I reach him in Chambers if he's not in 

               Chambers?"

               M.  Little Karate Hands breaking picket fences.

               N.  Some local delinquents about 10 or 12 years old, towing 

               behind their bicycles a little dead sand shark with signs: 

               "Amity Monster Shark." "Killed Here." 5 Cents a Hit." Etc.

               Then six blonde and tanned Coney Island meatballs descend 

               the ramp. They all wear Men's Club Lifeguard patches and 

               matching collegiate windbreakers. They scour the landing, 

               looking for someone to save.

               The boat is empty. Everybody heading inland, anticipating 

               the best Fourth of July ever. Already there is debris on the 

               docks and the cleaning crew works away at it.

               INSIDE THE FERRY

               As Bach's Little Fugue ends, the six burly crewmen lean their 

               combined weight against the Cathedral doors, closing out the 

               light and locking in the trade. The doors latch shut with a 

               resounding clang!

               ANGLE ON BRODY, NERVOUSLY WATCHING THE BEACH

               He is studying everything, trying to make sure he has it 

               covered as well as possible. He almost doesn't hear the 

               approaching roar of a small helicopter until it settles down 

               behind him, and a Flying Officer gets out, starched, pressed 

               fatigues, a flawless fatigue baseball cap, and slick dark 

               aviator's sunglasses. The Steve Canyon of Amity. He presents 

               Brody with a clipboard.

                              understand)

                         You pay for the gas.

               Brody signs. The Officer shakes his head as Brody makes an 

               error.

                                     BRODY

                         Just erase your signature and initial 

                         your erasure.

               Brody complies, shaking his head. The Officer snaps him a 

               salute, jogs lightly back to his idling copter, buckles in, 

               and gives Brody a "thumbs up" as he lifts off in a flurry of 

               sand and ice-cream wrappers.

               EXT. BEACH PARKING LOT - EARLY MORNING

               And this is it -- the Dawn Patrol, the only forces that the 

               frantic phone calling produced. Hendricks, and the regular 

               summer extra deputies. The lifeguards. Half a dozen state 

               troopers. Some deputies from neighboring towns, and a Coast 

               Guard ensign with a handful of regulars in work dungarees.

               Some of Hooper's friends from the institute.

               Brody and Hooper, badly in need of sleep, are watching the 

               crew straggle in. Already the first of the holiday beach-

               goers are piling out of their cars in a brightly colored 

               cascade of beach balls, umbrellas, blankets, portable bar-b-

               ques, radios, sun visors, reflectors, rafts, balls, tubes, 

               and newspapers.

               Hooper watches one such group: A Family of Ten getting out 

               of a camper-van. He watches in dismay as the family bumbles 

               onto the beach for a day of fun in the sun.

               Brody addresses his troops, such as they are.

                                     BRODY

               "When's lunch?" "I hate holidays," etc.

                                     ENSIGN

                         I want to get our lines and repellent 

                         out, so we better shove off.

               He nods to his men, who head for some Boston Whalers (or 

               similar boat with surf-riding capability) and push off into 

               the surf to patrol the swimming areas.

                                     BRODY

                              (a last caution)

                         We're all on one channel, so let's 

                         keep radio traffic to a minimum, 

                         okay?

               Everyone kind of nods acknowledgment.

                                     HOOPER

                         I hope we get some more help.

                                     BRODY

                         I wish it would rain...

               EXT. BEACH - AMUSEMENT AREA - CLOSE OF SHARK MACHINE

               In a shed near the bandstand, a half-dozen pinball and arcade 

               machines sucking quarters from holiday beach-goers. A 

               mechanical shark traverses the screen, is hit with an electric 

               harpoon and red "blood" blossoms from its side, indicating a 

               hit.

               Sounds of electronic gadgetry, people having fun. Meadows is 

               there writing it all up for the paper. A move away from the 

               screen of this particular machine reveals the arcade, the 

               parking lot, and, finally, the beginnings of the panorama of 

               the beach that July 4th has created.

               EXT. SOUTH BEACH - THE FOURTH OF JULY

               four foot surfer's swell curls and crashes on shore, 

               riderless. The broad sandy beach is a mosaic of summer color 

               as one thousand vacationers practice fun in the sun, but not 

               in the water. Hot dog stands and ice cream vendors are 

               everywhere.

               ANGLE - LIFEGUARD STATIONS

               A half-dozen lookout lofts. As many handsome lifeguards with 

               Walkie-Talkies strapped to their trunks and loud-hailers at 

               arm's reach. Bored, two of the hot dogs train their binoculars 

               on some local color.

               ANGLE ON TV MOBILE UNIT

               A TV Mobile Unit Van is setting up: cables snaking to cameras, 

               a camera with a big sports zoom sitting on the platform atop 

               the truck, a spiffy announcer-type in a blazer with his 

               station's call letters on the pocket. Inside the darkened 

               control room, we can see the pale blue squares of monitors 

               in a mosaic against one wall, facing the switcher.

               AT SEA

               Hooper is methodically patrolling in his boat. Tactically 

               flanking a three-hundred-yard apron of black repellent are 

               four small watch-boats. A tiny pleasure boat darts around 

               the repellent line. Farther out, crossing back and forth, 

               are patrol boats. To top it all off, a Coast Guard helicopter 

               hovers and patrols three hundred feet above.

               INT. TELEVISION MOBILE UNIT

               At least eight monitors, reflecting the outputs of three 

               cameras and two tape machines, as well as line, preview, and 

               effects monitors.

               MONITOR: CAMERA 1: Holding on a group of happy citizen-bathers 

               as they unpack their gear, wave to camera, run into the water.

               MONITOR: CAMERA 2: The Repellent Line, set in place by Coast 

               Guardsmen in small boats, setting out floats, dumping 

               repellent into the ocean.

               MONITOR: CAMERA 3: Close on the Bandstand, where Amity's 

               band is playing lilting patriotic airs.

               After we've seen this activity, we can take a look at what's 

               going on: the preparation of the tape segment for the six 

               o'clock news.

                                     TV DIRECTOR

                         Put 1 on the line. In five. 4. 3. 2. 

                         1. Roll.

               On the "Tape 1" and "Line" monitors, we see Vaughn being 

               interviewed by the Announcer in the blazer.

                                     ANNOUNCER

                         ...and with me is the Mayor of Amity, 

                         Lawrence Vaughn. Mr. Vaughn, how 

                         about those rumors?

                                     VAUGHN

                         How about them indeed. I'm pleased 

                         and happy to repeat the news that we 

                         have, in fact, caught and killed a 

                         large predator that supposedly injured 

                         some bathers here. As you can see, 

                         it's a beautiful day, the beaches 

                         are open, and the folks here are 

                         having a wonderful time. Amity, 

                         y'know, means 'Friendship.'

               MONITOR: CAMERA 1: As Vaughn speaks to us on the monitors, 

               the monitor for Camera 1 pans over to show a Sightseeing Bus 

               pull up in the parking area, and a horde of media vultures 

               spilling out, carrying cameras with long lenses and tripods, 

               telescopes, sunshades and parasols, all the equipment of the 

               curious and none of the equipment of the holiday bather or 

               swimmer.

               TAPE 1 AND LINE MONITORS: Close on the Announcer, Vaughn out 

               of the picture.

                                     ANNOUNCER

                         Also here today is a Marine Biologist 

                         and Research Fellow from the 

                         Oceanographic Institute, Matthew 

                         Hooper. Mr. Hooper, what've you heard?

                                     HOOPER

                         What I've heard and what I've seen 

                         are two different things. I believe 

                         there is a large Great White Shark -- 

                         Carcharodon Cacharias - in the waters 

                         off this very beach, that he has 

                         killed and that he will kill again...

               Hooper's voice fades off as someone at the mixer panel dials 

               his mike off, and brings up the Announcer's lavalier.

                                     ANNOUNCER

                              (moving into center 

                              frame)

                         And there you have it -- two different 

                         opinions, by men of good will. The 

                         holiday crowd here at Amity seems to 

                         be making up its own mind...

               The camera pans off him to a happy family headed for the 

               beach.

               MONITOR: CAMERA 3: Zooms in on the puffing face of the tuba 

               player.

               MONITOR: CAMERA 2: Brody and the Announcer.

               MONITOR: TAPE 1 and LINE: Back on the Announcer, his lips 

               moving, but his sound turned off. We hear, instead, the sound 

               from Monitor Camera 2, Brody and the same Announcer.

                                     BRODY

                         I'm sorry, I just don't have the 

                         time.

                                     TV DIRECTOR

                         Recue the machines. 2, pan off the 

                         Chief and show me some tits and ass. 

                         1, get me some cute kids. 3... see 

                         if you got a shot at the water.

               MONITORS: CAMERAS 1, 2 and 3: The cameras seek out the 

               appropriate activity as the Director calls for it.

                                     ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

                              (holds up stopwatch)

                         Mayor, 43 seconds, Biologist 45 

                         seconds. That's equal time, right?

                                     DIRECTOR

                         Right.

                              (he presses "Talkback" 

                              button to his 

                              announcer)

                         Jerry, come on in and look at this.

                              (to his headset)

               TAPE 2 - MONITOR:

               Starts showing us the assembled interview segment we've just 

               seen, starting with the Announcer's opening remarks.

                                     ANNOUNCER (V.O. MONITOR)

                         Amity Island is famed for its clear 

                         air and white sand beaches. But a 

                         cloud appeared...

               His voice is dialed under as the Announcer himself appears 

               in the control room to watch himself on the monitors.

                                     ANNOUNCER (LIVE)

                         Look at that shine on my nose. It's 

                         a beacon.

                                     DIRECTOR

                         Close enough for remote.

               As Vaughn begins his spiel again, the other monitors show us 

               the action on the beach.

                                     VAUGHN (V.O.)

                         ...I'm pleased and happy...

                                     DIRECTOR

                         Think we ought to stick around?

                                     ANNOUNCER

                         What else you got?

                                     ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

                         Teachers' strike downtown.

                                     CAMERAMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

                         Christenson, this is Al. Union says 

                         time for Engineering Five.

                                     DIRECTOR

                         That's five minutes, guys. Coffee.

               ANGLE ON THE BEACH

               Vaughn is in his shirtsleeves, having slipped out of his 

               jacket.

               He mops his brow, and surveys the beachfront. At this moment, 

               there's nobody swimming. He approaches a familiar Selectman, 

               nods hello, and squats beside him on the sand.

                                     VAUGHN

                         Why don't you get in the water?

                                     SELECTMAN

                         I don't want to wash off my suntan 

                         lotion. I'll get a burn...

                                     VAUGHN

                              (some urgency)

                         Nobody's going in!

               On an adjoining blanket, a spirited Ruth Gordon type is 

               sitting, watching brightly as her manservant, a polished 

               Eric Harrison type, prepares some tea from a thermos.

                                     WOMAN

                         Is there nobody going in? What a 

                         shame. Arthur, should I be going in?

                                     ARTHUR (THE BUTLER)

                              (pouring tea)

                         If you'd like.

               He puts down the tea service, and leads her towards the water.

               At the edge of the sea, she stops, and he walks in.

                                     ARTHUR

                              (as he enters the 

                              waves)

                         It's very nice. Not too cold... Quite 

                         refreshing... Very pleasant....

               He ducks his head under for a final look around. His dripping 

               head rises triumphantly from the surf.

                                     ARTHUR

                         No sharks, m'lady.

               She starts into the water, he takes her parasol, escorting 

               her the rest of the way into the ocean.

                                     WOMAN

                         This is marvelous! Arthur, I want to 

                         come back to this very spot. Will 

                         you make a note of where we are?

               WIDE - ON THE BEACH

               Encouraged by the sight of the Woman and Arthur, and Vaughn's 

               quiet urgings, people begin to wander into the surf, a few 

               at first, and then a rush, as people plunge in and begin 

               enjoying the pleasures of ocean bathing. The Selectman goes 

               in, his family follows, Vaughn watches it all, beaming.

               BOAT #7

               Hendricks is on the radio while a Coast Guard spotter works 

               the sonar.

               He is walking down the beach, threading his way through the

                         Beautiful day, Chief!

               A group of youngsters playing with Michael Brody's dinghy.

               They are hauling it toward the surf.

                                     BRODY

                         Hey Mikey -- !

               Michael turns as Brody trots toward him.

                                     BRODY

                         You're not going to the ocean with 

                         that, are you son?

                                     MICHAEL

                         I'm all checked out for light surf 

                         and look at it.

                                     BRODY

                         Do me this favor just once. Use the 

                         ponds.

                                     MICHAEL

                         Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.

                                     BRODY

                         Just a favor for your old man.

                                     MICHAEL

                              (confused)

                         Sure, Dad.

               TV CREW - NEAR WATER

               TV cameramen are packing up their gear. For them it's a wrap

               REPELLENT LINE - COUNTY POLICEMAN

               Suddenly his Walkie-Talkie fizzes, and the Copter Spotter's 

               voice overloads the speaker.

                                     COPTER SPOTTER

                         Copter to Daisy! Red Four, Red Four!

               BOAT #7 - HENDRICKS

               Guns are up, heads turning everywhere.

                                     HENDRICKS

                              (into walkie-talkie)

                         Where -- ?

                                     COPTER SPOTTER

                         Went under your -- There!

               The Coast Guard sonar operator spots it and pales. A slick 

               black dorsal fin is slicing a wake toward the swimming area.

                                     SONAR OPERATOR

                         Jesus Christ -- Shark!

               BEACH - BRODY

               Rigid and choked, he almost breaks the "send" button trying 

               to transmit.

                                     BRODY

                         Everybody out! Out of the water, 

                         please -- leave the water, please --

               A lifeguard in a loft behind him begins blowing on his 

               whistle.

               CLOSE - BRODY

               shouting hysterically.

                                     BRODY

                         No whistles! No whistles!

               THE BEACH

               Dozens of bathers halfway out of the water, turn to see. 

               More whistles, and they start toward shore. We hear panicky 

               voices ad-libbing; "Shark," "Look Out," etc. The loudhailers 

               sounding more urgent now, and a contagious dread seizes one 

               person after another. Entire groups of people begin pulling 

               toward shore, some of them obviously trying to control a 

               growing hysteria in others.

               BOATS #6 AND #7

               are converging, heading toward the repellent line as if 

               tracking an underwater shadow. The fin is beyond the repellent 

               cordons and heading into the crowds.

               HOOPER'S BOAT

               Caught on the other end of the line, he is wheeling in a 

               broad, hot-dogger's circle turn, headed back.

               THE WATER - BATHERS

               People begin screaming. Kids are suddenly separated from 

               their parents. Others seem to forget how to swim. One myopic 

               little girl has her glasses bumped off and she begins to cry 

               in blinded panic. Ellen Brody looks around frantic.

               BOATS #2, #3, #4

               The riflemen in the boats are trying to get a bead, but too 

               many civilians create a hazard. The Coast Guardsmen attempt 

               to sever the repellent cord to gain access to the bathing 

               area and the heaving fin.

               THE WATER - BATHERS

               This is a confirmation of our worst dread -- a full-blown 

               headlong water panic. Screaming vacationers claw their way 

               over the bodies of the less able. Some literally attempt to 

               walk over the bobbing heads and glistening backs of others 

               pulling for dry land.

               CLOSEUPS - PANIC

               Horrified faces. Some are stunned and wandering in slow, 

               tentative circles, while others are helped out by friends.

               Five people try to mount a rubber raft.

               Ugly reminders that each of us is Number One.

               Brody enters shot, yelling into his walkie-talkie, someone 

               charges past him to help an old man out of the water.

               EXT. THE BEACH

               Dragging the helpless from the surf. Tears well in Brody's 

               eyes. The screaming is deafening. The TV unit is hopping up 

               and down in rage and frustration.

                                     TV DIRECTOR

                         Why did we wrap? Get that! Somebody 

                         get that!

               One thousand survivors pack the beach, standing absolutely 

               still. A numbing cold sets in, and people shiver against 

               each other.

               Muted sobs, whimpering, coughing.

               The six burly lifeguards huddle together like Cub Scouts.

               ANGLE - BATHING AREA

               The monstrous black fin turns a slow circle as two Coast 

               Guardsmen manage to cut their own repellent line. All boats 

               converge on the dynamic fin. Men raise their guns to fire. 

               Others adlib nautical commands in a uniquely calculated 

               fashion.

               CLOSE - FIN

               It slips sideways, revealing for the first time a tiny blue 

               snorkel. Then appears the faces of two youngsters whom we 

               will recall from the coven behind the dune. The fin bobs 

               back, a beaverboard replica attached to a partially submerged 

               surfboard. One youngster looks up and is greeted by:

               YOUNGSTER'S POINT OF VIEW

               Twenty rifles and shotguns pointed directly at him. 

               Surrounding him on three sides. Some of the policemen start 

               to lower their guns -- struck dumb.

               HOOPER IN HIS BOAT

               He throttles back suddenly, subsiding into his own wake, his 

               eyes still restlessly searching.

               CLOSE - YOUNGSTER

               his only defense, he begins to cry -- and feebly raises his 

               hands in unconditional surrender.

               ANGLE - ESTUARY

               The narrow estuary leading into the half-mile is rough today.

               Two children digging in the sand and unaware of the beach 

               panic one hundred yards away look up, and the little girl 

               points.

               BLACK DORSAL FIN

               is cruising through the narrows and toward the busy pond.

               HOOPER IN HIS BOAT AGAIN

               He sees it, and jams his throttle forward. He steers with 

               one hand, fumbling urgently for his walkie-talkie with the 

               other.

               AERIAL VIEW

               The circle of boats around the little pranksters, the crowds 

               huddled on the beach, Hooper's boat suddenly arrowing towards 

               the estuary, leaving a huge boiling wake.

               CLOSE ON VAUGHN

               He catches Hooper's boat out of the corner of his eye. 

               Curious, he follows its progress. It's urgency finally 

               communicates itself to Vaughn, who begins a shambling trot 

               across the dunes towards a rise overlooking the estuary.

               OVERLOOKING THE ESTUARY

               Vaughn gets there just in time to see the disaster. He 

               watches, helpless, trying to shout, out of breath. Stunned.

               ANGLE - POND

               Michael is tacking full-sail in his boat with a friend, Kit.

               Kit is admiring the shark's tooth necklace around his own 

               neck while Michael rubs some water on the scratches left by 

               it.

               The fin, huge, black and real, crosses behind them. They are 

               not yet aware. The fin seems to circle and return. It heads 

               toward Michael's boat when another small dinghy gets in its 

               way -- a weekend novice just finishing a thermos of coffee 

               when he is "bumped." The entire boat is overturned. Michael 

               sees the fin now as it collides with him, the entire bow 

               lifting out of the water and rolling over on the port side.

               Michael and Kit are thrown head first.

               Three heads in the water come up sputtering, the fin between 

               them crossing back. Michael freezes. The fin comes directly 

               at him, growing into the sky, passing him so close he could 

               touch it, but ignoring him as it follows the flailing and 

               panicked weekend novice. Catches him. Michael watches. That 

               all too familiar explosion of water -- a choked off scream -- 

               the head and upper torso of the novice passing Michael swiftly 

               as though being carried off -- a current of blood trailing 

               behind.

                                     THE VICTIM

                              (passing a horrified 

                              Michael, who half 

                              extends one hand, as 

                              if to help)

                         It's no good. I'm dead...

                              (and he is)

               A renewed cry of shark!

               CLOSE - BRODY

               He turns. Oh God! Running through the slogging sand.

               CLOSE - ELLEN

               A sudden turn. She runs.

               CLOSE - HOOPER IN BOAT

               He's got the walkie-talkie to his mouth.

                                     HOOPER

                         Block the estuary! The estuary!

               Three boats racing to carry out the orders. The black fin re-

               passing the two children, racing to get out. Hooper reaches 

               the mouth before the others. The fin won't veer off. It smacks 

               into the little vessel, bumping it aside. The fin is left 

               racing into open water. Blood leavings. Hooper leaping over 

               the side, slogging towards Michael.

               WIDE ON WATER

               Copter roars in buzzing the shark, but too late.

               CLOSE - BRODY AND ELLEN

               They are pulling Michael out of the water as Hooper splashes 

               up. Michael is conscious but in shock -- his eyes staring at 

               nothing.

                                     BRODY

                              (feeling his face)

                         He's in shock. Get blankets!

               People gather and Brody snatches beach towels out of their 

               hands. They cover Michael and carry him off the beach, feet 

               raised above his head.

               INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

               Michael is wheeled out in the bed. Brody and Ellen are there.

               Sean is sleepy in Brody's arms. Vaughn is waiting in the 

               hall.

                                     NURSE

                         The doctor said it's okay -- mild 

                         shock. He can come home in the 

                         morning.

                                     ELLEN

                              (to Michael)

                         Hey, big guy -- you want anything 

                         from home?

                                     MICHAEL

                         My cars. And a comic book.

                                     BRODY

                         Here --

                              (gives baby to Ellen)

                         Take him home.

                                     ELLEN

                         Home... New York?

                         No. Home here.

               Ellen exits.

                                     BRODY

                              (crossing to Vaughn)

                         Got a pen on you?

                                     VAUGHN

                         Why?

                                     BRODY

                         There's only one thing you're good 

                         for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. 

                         Here. It's an authorization to employ 

                         a contractor.

                         I don't know if I can do that without 

                         a...

                                     BRODY

                              (interrupting)

                         I'm going to hire Quint to kill the 

                         fish. I want to see that shark dead.

                                     VAUGHN

                         Maybe we can save August...

                         Forget it. This summer's had it.

                         Next summer's had it. You're the 

                         mayor of Shark City. You wanted to 

                         keep the beaches open. What happens 

                         when the town finds out about that?

                                     VAUGHN

                         I was acting in the town's best 

                         interests...

                                     BRODY

                         The best interest in this town would 

                         be to see that fish belly-up in the 

                         water with a hole in his head. You 

                         do the right thing. You authorize 

                         me.

                              (indicates paper)

                         Right there. Whatever it costs.

                                     VAUGHN

                         My kids were on that beach...

                                     BRODY

                         Just sign it, Larry.

               Vaughn signs, and Brody takes the paper and exits.

               QUINT'S HOUSE - DAY

               Brody and Hooper are approaching Quint's house. They enter 

               through the big wooden doors, into another circle of Hell.

               Smoke and steam from two big oil drums sitting over fires 

               fills the air. Quint and his mate, Herschel, are grinding 

               pieces of pilot whale into chum. The whale lies bloody on 

               the floor, its ruined carcass adding to the stench of other 

               sharks being boiled in the drums, their tails suspended in 

               the air.

               Diesel fumes and decay fill the air, and tools, ropes, broken 

               bits of iron and engine parts litter the floor. Wall hangings 

               of rope and floats, and buoys, barrels, tackle and gear all 

               conspire to frame the killing floor.

               Brody and Hooper navigate the obstacle course.

                                     BRODY

                         This has got to be one big 

                         violation...

                         This is quite a place.

                                     QUINT'S VOICE

                         Keep your hands off my stuff.

               He emerges from the steam and smoke.

                                     QUINT

                         Did you bring a check?

                         What?

                                     QUINT

                         Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake

                         And, uh, a case of apricot brandy 

                         and you buy the lunch.

                                     BRODY

                         Two cases. And dinner when you land.

               Brody tastes.

               Herschel interrupts. He's stopped working, and is wiping his 

               hands on a bloody rag.

                                     HERSCHEL

               Quint wheels to face him.

                         I'm not goin'. No sir.

                         Forget the money. You can't pay me 

                         enough. I ain't crazy. I worked some 

                         big mean fish with you, but I ain't 

                         goin' on this one.

                         This is the last time I hear from 

                         you. I don't want anyone with piss 

                         for blood on my vessel. Put that 

                         blackfish on board, pump the bilges, 

                         and top off the fuel tanks, and finish 

                         up in the morning. Then you're on 

                         the beach.

               Quint turns to see this new voice, and starts walking towards 

               him.

                                     BRODY

                         This is Matt Hooper...

                                     QUINT

                         He's from the Oceanographic Institute.

                         I'm not talking about day sailing or 

                         pleasure boating. I'm talking about 

                         working for a living. Sharking.

                                     HOOPER

                         And I'm not talking about hooking 

                         some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm 

                         talking about a Great White.

                                     QUINT

                         Are you now. I know about porkers in 

                         the water --

                         Here. Tie me a sheepshank.

               Hooper ties the knot effortlessly.

                                     HOOPER

                         I don't need to pass basic seamanship.

                         Let me see your hands...

               He takes Hooper's hands in his own big bloody fists, and 

               feels them as he talks.

                                     QUINT

                         Ha. City hands. You been counting 

                         money. If you had a $5000 net and 

                         $2000 worth of fish in it, and along 

                         comes Mr. White, and makes it look 

                         like a kiddy scissors class has gone 

                         to work on it and made paper dolls. 

                         If you'd ever worked for a living, 

                         you'd know what that means.

                         this working class hero crap. Some

               EXT. QUINT'S DOCK - MORNING

               The Mate is loading. He hands Quint the items on his check 

               list as Quint takes them aboard.

               As he talks, we see Hooper coming down to the dock. Wheeling 

               a wagon behind him are two long-haired Research Assistants 

               from the Institute. On the wagon, among other things, is a 

               big shark cage. At dockside, Hooper checks his list, as he 

               signs for his issue.

               Brody nods, and holds her hand for a wordless moment.

                                     QUINT (O.S.)

                              (sings)

                         'Here is the body of Mary Lee. For 

                         15 years she kept her virginity. Not 

                         a bad record for this vicinity.'

               There is a sputter and roar as the Orca's diesels kick on.

                                     BRODY

                         Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.

                                     ELLEN

                              (hugging him)

                         What'll I tell the kids?

                                     BRODY

                         Tell 'em I went fishin'!

               They laugh together, and exchange a short, fierce kiss.

                                     QUINT

                         Cast off the bow line! Now your stern!

               Its diesels chugging, the Orca pulls away from the pier.

               Ellen has already resolutely turned her back on it, and is 

               walking off the dock back onto dry land.

               ABOARD THE ORCA

               Quint has set a course out towards the open sea. He lashes 

               the wheel, and jumps down to address Hooper and Brody, who 

               are standing together in the stern.

                                     QUINT

                              (to Brody)

                         Front-Bow, Back-Stern, Port, 

                         Starboard. Aloft, Below. It's not a 

                         staircase, it's a ladder, it's not a 

                         rope, it's a line, and if you don't 

                         get it right...

                              (indicates porthole)

                         I'll throw your ass through that 

                         little round window.

               He laughs at his joke. This is probably something he tells 

               all his charters.

                                     QUINT

                         Now hear this. You're aboard the 

                         fishing vessel 'Orca,' and I'm her 

                         Captain, Master, Mate, and Owner. 

                         You'll jump when I holler. We're 

                         doin' a job here, and Christ, I ain't 

                         got time to watch you birds get hooks 

                         in your ass and fall overboard. Ship 

                         with me, and you'll do all right. 

                         Cross me, and I'll slap you upside 

                         your heads. Now -- if you boys are 

                         ready -- let's go fishin'.

               He starts moving gear around, preparing chum barrels, setting 

               hooks, Hooper gives him a hand, Brody stays out of the way.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. THE OCEAN - NOON

               It is quiet as the Orca drifts along in the current, a wide 

               chum slick spreading behind it. A couple of flag buoys spread 

               along our perspective show us the miles the boat has gone.

               Quint spots something in the water -- a small blue shark 

               attracted by the chum. He rigs a small pole with a piece of 

               bait, and throws it over the side.

                                     QUINT

                         Here's something for you...

               The shark takes the bait, Quint brutally and efficiently 

               sets the hook, and reels the shark alongside. He hauls it 

               part way out of the water, and sticks it with a gaff. Hooper 

               and Brody watch.

               INSERT - SHARK WRIGGLING ON HOOK

               Tailrope dropping on him. Gaffed and bleeding, the shark is 

               immobilized by Quint's practiced hands. He takes one of his 

               big knives and poses for a moment beside the struggling fish.

                                     QUINT

                         These greedy sons-a-bitches will eat 

                         their own guts.

               He slices into the shark's underbelly. We hear the sound of 

               entrails plopping into the water. Brody is almost retching, 

               and Hooper is just displeased.

               ANGLE ON THE WATER

               The gutted shark swimming in circles biting at its own 

               entrails.

               Fins closing in on the wounded shark.

                         Go ahead, you cannibals. Tell 'em 

                         where you got it!

               SHARK FRENZY

               A boil of water and the flash of fins and teeth as the local 

               sharks erupt in a feeding frenzy, jaws snapping, blood 

               spewing, a sudden display of the fury and blind predatory 

               drive of the fearsome species.

                                     HOOPER

                         What's that supposed to prove?

                         Just a little appetizer. I want our 

                         porker to know we're serving. I want

               EXT. THE OCEAN - AFTERNOON

               The Orca is drifting in neutral. The ocean is like gelatin, 

               the sun sucking heat waves from its surface. Brody at the 

               stern, handkerchief on his head to protect from further 

               sunburn, has been handed the slimiest job on a shark hunt:  

               the ladling out of chum. There are several empty chum barrels. 

               A flag buoy bobs in the wake of the boat, another waits to 

               be tossed over the side. Brody is reeling with nausea. He 

               opens his overnight kit and takes out a handkerchief and 

               some Old Spice after-shave. He pours the after-shave into 

               the cloth, presses it to his nose. Hooper is also in the 

               stern.

                         Keep that chum line going -- we've 

                         got five good miles. Don't break it.

                                     BRODY

                         Who's driving the boat?

                         Nobody. We're drifting with the 

                         current.

                                     HOOPER

                              (using the fish finder)

                         Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.

                              (to Hooper)

                         Hell, in the old days we went out 

                         with good charts, good sounding lead, 

                         and a damn good compass. Nowadays, 

                         these kids are afraid to go out 

                         without depth finders, radar, radio, 

                         electric toothbrush, every stupid 

                         thing...

               Quint opens a can of beer and drains it in one long pull, 

               crushing the empty and throwing it over the side. Hooper 

               drains his coffee from a styrofoam cup, and cracks it in his 

               hand with a silly "plup." He stows the pieces in an empty 

               chum barrel.

                                     QUINT

                              (to Brody)

                         Get a fresh barrel.

               Brody goes to unlash a fresh barrel, but can't figure out 

               the knots. He finally tugs on a piece of rope, and it all 

               comes loose... barrel, shark cage, and, most important, 

               Hooper's tanks, clattering and rolling on the deck.

                         didn't go to schools in electronics. 

                         He was born with what he does best.

                         he might eat this stuff, but then

               The men are in different positions on the boat. Hooper on 

               the flying bridge. Quint in the stern, Brody hanging over 

               the rail, puking.

               Quint takes a wide red strip of whale meat and a gnarled 

               squid from the garbage pail, and searches for a No. 2 hook 

               rig. He holds up a strip of whale.

               Brody shades his eyes from the white sun as Quint baits up.

                         size of a radish.

               Quint sits in the fighting chair. He casts off, murmuring as 

               the line feeds out.

               Quint at ease in his chair, Brody near him, practicing tying 

               knots. The line starts to move, a few feet at a time; both 

               men watch. Then the line whizzes off the reel. Brody jumps 

               up. Hooper springs to the deck. Quint puts his hand on the 

               drag and addresses the situation softly.

               Quint tightens drag and strikes. The line goes whizzing out.

               Brody runs to Quint's side. Hooper springs up to the flying 

               bridge.

               Brody goes to get water, the boat surges, he staggers. Brody 

               pours water on the screaming reel, nearly unspooled now.

               Hooper is turning the boat around and the line changes

                         Where the hell is he going?

               Quint reeling in like mad.

                                     QUINT

                         Oh, this ain't foolin' me --

                              (rod arcs down with a 

                              surge)

                         Sure -- try it!

               He ad libs brief instructions to Brody as the line rushes 

               out and there is less tension. Quint is horsing up and down, 

               reeling in.

                                     QUINT

                         Makin' believe it's easy now.

               The line is almost vertical, and Quint shows a hint of 

               bafflement. He reels in suspiciously.

                                     QUINT

                         Gettin' ready to run again -- no? 

                         No?

                              (suspicious)

                         What's he playin' here?

                              (reels in furiously, 

                              to Brody)

                         Put the gloves on!

                              (to fish)

                         Let's see who's gonna tease who now!

                                     HOOPER

                         Let it go, don't waste your time.

                                     QUINT

                              (to Hooper)

                         Down here, Hooper!

               Hooper is rushing down.

                                     HOOPER

                         I don't know what it is, but it's 

                         not a shark.

                                     QUINT

                              (bathed in sweat; 

                              hauling, reeling)

                         Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in 

                         the lab, but out here you're just 

                         supercargo, and you'll do as I say, 

                         or you can take your gear and 

                         backstroke home. Now get down here!

               The leaders show above the water line. Brody is wide-eyed, 

               waiting for that first look.

                                     BRODY

                         The wire's showing!

                                     QUINT

                              (to Brody)

                         Unbuckle me -- fast!

                              (to Hooper)

                         Grab the leader. He ain't normal, 

                         this one... they never --

                                     HOOPER

                         It's too wild, too erratic. It's a 

                         marlin or a stingray. It's a gamefish.

               Hooper snaps the rope onto the leader and holds on.

                                     QUINT

                         Watch your hands --

                              (suddenly to Brody)

                         Grab onto this!

               Before he realizes what's happening, Brody is clumsily 

               clutching at the big rod, appalled. Quint skips away for a 

               flying gaff. He picks one, turns...

               That's when the leader lashes free, sending Hooper crashing 

               backward in a serious fall, and the rod whips at Brody's 

               forehead, drawing blood. Quint snatches up the rod and reels 

               in.

               The wires have been bitten through.

                                     QUINT

                              (to Hooper)

                         A marlin, or a stingray. Huh. Don't 

                         ever tell me my business again. Get 

                         back up on the bridge.

                                     HOOPER

                              (stunned)

                         I'm okay...

                                     QUINT

                              (to Brody)

                         Fasten the pole.

                                     BRODY

                         What's the point with hooks and Lines? --

                                     QUINT

                         Don't tell me my business!

                              (to Hooper, points)

                         Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle.

               Hooper shakes off his dizziness and obeys. Brody watches 

               Quint rig up a new leader, hook up the same bait.

                                     BRODY

                              (nursing forehead, 

                              gesturing at rod and 

                              reel)

                         How -- if they're gonna keep on 

                         breaking?

                                     QUINT

                         What I do is trick him to the surface, 

                         got that? Then I can jab him, 

                         understand?

                              (goes to flybridge, 

                              muttering)

                         Think I'm gonna haul it in as if 

                         he's a catfish, like everyone else 

                         does?

               Brody goes inside to inspect his forehead.

               ON BRIDGE - HOOPER AND QUINT

                                     QUINT

                              (suddenly, pointing)

                         Over there!

                                     HOOPER

                         What do you see?

                                     QUINT

                              (still looking)

                         At least you handle the boat all 

                         right. Stop. Here... Cut the engine.

               Hooper cuts the engines as Quint swings nimbly down. He stands 

               stock still on the main deck, motioning Brody to be silent.

               Then picking up the newly rigged rod, Quint softshoes it 

               over to the chair. About to sit down, he freezes.

               CLOSE - QUINT

               looking hard at something.

               CLOSE - BRODY

               staring, eyes widening.

               CLOSE - HOOPER

               moving in, surprised, interested, fascinated.

               THEIR COMBINED POINT OF VIEW

               We see the shark. First the fin... then the head and upper 

               jaws, ten or twenty yards off the side of the boat. It finally 

               submerges, its tail giving a final slap.

               ANGLE ON QUINT

               He puts his rod away and stares at it. And stares. And stares.

               Hooper is the first to break the silence.

                                     HOOPER

                         20 feet, if it's an inch...

                                     QUINT

                         25 feet. And three tons of him there.

               Hooper is nearly beside himself with a strange ecstasy. He 

               leaps toward his gear.

                                     QUINT

                              (quietly, to Brody)

                         I never saw one that big.

                                     BRODY

                         What do we do? Get some help? Radio 

                         in?

               Quint ignores him and moves off into the pilot house, where 

               he swiftly takes out his green case, and opens it to begin 

               to assemble something inside it. Brody is alone on the deck 

               with Hooper.

                                     BRODY

                         How're we gonna handle this?

               Hooper is contained in his own excitement. He has finally 

               come up with what he was looking for -- an expensive Nikon 

               through which he peers intently at the shark alongside. He 

               is talking half to himself as he fine-tunes the range finder 

               and focus.

               He is squeaking and bubbling in an unsuppressed emotional 

               boil.

                                     HOOPER

                              (very, very high)

                         There's a formula! Girth, about 150 

                         inches, squared, divide by 800 -- 

                         son of a bitch, they are not going 

                         to believe this! -- divide by 2000... 

                         three tons!

                              (after Quint)

                         You're right, you old fart! Three 

                         tons!

                              (ad libs ecstasy)

               CLOSE ON QUINT IN THE PILOT HOUSE

               He is assembling the Greener harpoon gun, deftly screwing on 

               the long wooden stock, the heavy steel barrel, and big shaft 

               with the wicked barbs, the frame all rigged with line. Past 

               him, on the deck, we can still see Hooper. As Quint is working 

               with the gun, the radio suddenly squawks into life.

                                     RADIO VOICE (V.O.)

                         Amity Point Light Station to Orca. 

                         This is Amity Point Light Station, 

                         to Orca...

               Quint snaps the mouthpiece to his lips.

                                     QUINT

                         Orca here.

                         Put her on.

                                     ELLEN'S VOICE

                         ...push this? Oh. It's working. Hello, 

                         Martin?

                                     QUINT

                         This is Quint, Missus.

                                     ELLEN'S VOICE

                         I just wanted to know if you were 

                         all right... the Coast Guard let me 

                         use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?

                                     QUINT

                         He's busy.

                                     ELLEN'S VOICE

                         Well... is everything all right?

                                     QUINT

                         Just fine, Missus. We'll be back 

                         soon. Everything's fine. We haven't 

                         seen anything yet. Orca out.

               He snaps off the radio, and, for good measure, pulls the 

               plug from the power source.

               ANGLE FROM DECK

               The big shark is slicing through the water just below the 

               surface, its fin high, the big gray back glistening, the 

               teeth gleaming.

               ANGLE - INCLUDING FOREDECK

                                     HOOPER

                              (on deck)

                         Damn it! I need something in the 

                         foreground to give it some scale. 

                         Martin! Stand here! No, to your left!

               He is positioning Martin frantically, trying to include Brody, 

               the shark, and the Orca in the same frame. Quint finishes 

               with the gun, and as a final gesture, snaps an explosive 

               cartridge into the breech. He empties the box of cartridges 

               onto the table, snatches up a big handful, and drops them 

               into a pocket, and heads out on deck, bound for the bow 

               pulpit.

               ON DECK

               Quint appears with the harpoon gun. He throws one end of the 

               line to Hooper.

                                     QUINT

                         Here. Rig this to the forward keg up 

                         there.

               He indicates the barrels on the foredeck.

                                     QUINT

                              (to Brody)

                         Get up there and steer her. Follow 

                         my hand, and hold 'er steady. I've 

                         got to get a clean shot at that 

                         porker's head.

               Quint moves up toward the bow, Brody goes up to the flying 

               bridge to take the wheel, Hooper starts for the foredeck, 

               but stops to rummage in his kit, throwing gear around as he 

               desperately hunts for something.

                                     QUINT

                         Hurry up, rig the line!

               ANGLE ON HOOPER

               He finds what he's looking for. A small, powerful strobe 

               unit, waterproofed, a miniature signal beacon. He triggers 

               it, and it begins to pulse with a light we can see even in 

               the sun.

               Hooper scampers to the foredeck and begins to rig the light 

               to the first barrel, as the shark begins to surface near the 

               bow.

                                     QUINT

                              (to Brody)

                         Come to port. Watch my hand. Steady 

                         now...

               He guides Brody with hand signals. Brody tries urgently to 

               get it right, not to oversteer, to try to hold the big boat 

               with its throbbing diesels on the course that Quint is 

               indicating.

                                     QUINT

                         The line, man, the line!

               Hooper is rigging like crazy.

               FROM THE FLYING BRIDGE

               Brody steering f.g., Hooper on the foredeck with the barrels, 

               Quint leaning out over the pulpit, the gun at the ready, the 

               shark crossing inexorably in front of them.

               CLOSE ON QUINT

               Agonizing over his shot as the shark approaches, glancing 

               back to see if the line is properly rigged and Hooper is 

               clear of it.

                                     QUINT

                         Get clear, damn you!

               The shark is in position, Hooper shouts, a moment too late.

                                     HOOPER

                         Clear!

               Quint fires. The harpoon slams into the shark behind his 

               head, half-way along the back in front of the big dorsal 

               fin.

                                     QUINT

                         Jesus H. Christ On a Crutch!

               INSERT - COILED ROPE AND BARREL

               The rope snaps out in a blur of violent motion, Hooper jumps 

               back, and the barrel leaps out of its rack, pulled by the 

               line rigged to the harpoon. It bounds forward and into the 

               sea, past Quint, who is already reloading, mounting another 

               steel shaft. In the distance, the barrel bobs and skips 

               violently in the water, dragged by the shark in his merciless 

               moves.

               THE FOREDECK - QUINT

                                     QUINT

                         Now you've done it, you piss-ant. 

                         Stop and rig a goddam tinker toy to 

                         my gear. Let the bastard fight the 

                         keg for a while. He can't stay down 

                         with that on.

               Hooper, furious with himself, runs for the flying bridge to 

               take the helm from Brody.

               THE FLYING BRIDGE, BRODY AND HOOPER

               Hooper has snatched the wheel, and is ramming the throttle 

               forward as he spins the wheel in a frantic 180 degree turn.

                                     HOOPER

                              (to Quint)

                         Rig another keg! I'm bringing her 

                         around!

               His eyes dart about the ocean, looking for the barrel, as he 

               hot-dogs the ship around in a violent expression of his own 

               disgust with himself.

                                     HOOPER

                              (to himself)

                         God damn it! We had him!

                              (to Quint)

                         I'm coming about!

               He spins the wheel again, trying to make the big boat handle 

               like a formula speedster. The decks tip and the rigging sways 

               under the sudden strain. Brody is caught unaware, and tumbles 

               off his feet, sliding across the deck to fetch up against a 

               wall. the M1 Rifle is close to his hand. He stares at it.

               FROM THE FLYING BRIDGE

               Hooper is anguished, intense, trying to find the shark, 

               spinning the wheel, compounding his error, tipping the boat 

               in rolling turns as he crosses his own wake. Quint has turned 

               his back to the sea, and is in the pulpit looking up at 

               Hooper, staring at him, excluding everything else.

               As Quint folds his arms and stares at Hooper, we realize the 

               sun is going down, and it's getting dark.

                                     BRODY

                         Why don't we go in? Get another crack 

                         at him tomorrow.

                                     QUINT

                         We got a barrel on him. We can't 

                         lose him. We stay out here until we 

                         find him.

               Hooper throttles back, and the roar of the diesels subsides 

               and the boat resumes an even keel, slowly circling the ocean.

                                     BRODY

                         Let's call in -- we can radio and 

                         have a big boat here in an hour...

                                     QUINT

                              (grim)

                         You hired me, remember? It's my 

                         $10,000. It's my shark...

               EXT. ORCA - OPEN SEA - NIGHT

               Throttled back to slow ahead, the boat circles the water 

               endlessly, staying over the shark like an avenging angel. 

               Its running lights gleam in the night, and a glow lights the 

               interior of the pilot house. A bright strobe glints on the 

               water winking once like a firefly.

               INT. PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

               Brody and Hooper at the table, Quint at the wheel, keeping 

               his eye on the light.

                                     QUINT

                         He's up again.

               He corrects course slightly to keep the barrel buoy in sight.

               Hooper is sitting at the table, morose. Brody is staring at 

               a couple of open cans of beans or beef stew, or some other 

               crappy rations Quint has on board. Dirty spoons stuck in the 

               open cans show us this has not been a formal dinner. Quint 

               fumbles on the chart shelf and produces some of his home 

               brew.

               He takes a pull, and hands it to Hooper, who takes a double.

               Brody touches the fresh abrasion on his forehead, where the 

               fishing rod caught him.

               Quint bends forward and pulls his hair aside to show something 

               near the crown.

                                     QUINT

                         That's not so bad. Look at this: 

                         ...St. Paddy's Day in Knocko Nolans, 

                         in Boston, where some sunovabitch 

                         winged me upside the head with a 

                         spittoon.

               Brody looks politely. Hooper stirs himself.

                                     HOOPER

                         Look here.

                         Steve Kaplan bit me during recess.

               Quint is amused. He presents his own formidable forearm.

                         Wire burn. Trying to stop a backstay 

                         from taking my head off.

                         Moray Eel. Bit right through a wet 

                         suit.

               Brody is fascinated. Quint and Hooper take a long pull from 

               the bottle.

                                     QUINT

                              forward)

                         ...that's from some crazy Frenchie

                         the snot locker and laid him amongst 

                         the sweetpeas.

                         Ever see one like this?

               He hauls up his pants leg, revealing a wicked white scar.

                         Bull shark scraped me while I was 

                         taking samples...

                         Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --

               He starts rolling up his own dirty pants leg.

                         Slammed with a thresher's tail. Look 

                         just like somebody caressed me with 

                         a nutmeg grater...

               Brody is drawn into their boasting comparisons. He secretly 

               checks his own appendix scar, decides not to enter the 

               contest.

                                     HOOPER

                         I'll drink to your leg.

                         And I'll drink to yours.

               They toast each other. Brody looks around, sees the strobe 

               blink once through the darkened window.

                                     QUINT

                         Wait a minute, young fella. Look. 

                         Just look. Don't touch...

               He starts lowering his pants to reveal a place on one hip 

               where the tissue is scarred and irregular.

                                     QUINT

                         ...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope 

                         and onto the deck. You don't get

                         I think I can top that, Mister...

               Hooper is pulling at his shirt, trying to get it off, but 

               it's tangling its sleeves, and won't come undone.

                                     HOOPER

                         Gimme a hand, here. I got something 

                         to show you --

               Brody lends a hand. The shirt slips part way off.

                                     HOOPER

                              (indicating his chest)

                         broke my heart. Let's drink to Mary 

                         Ellen.

               The two men raise their mugs in a toast.

                         And here's to the ladies. And here's 

                         to their sisters; I'd rather one 

                         Miss than a shipload of Misters.

               He drinks, Hooper follows.

                         June 29th, 1945, three and a half 

                         minutes past midnight, two torpedoes 

                         from a Japanese submarine slammed 

                         into our side. Two or three. We was

                         near eleven hundred men went over 

                         the side. The life boats was lashed 

                         down so tight to make the bomb run 

                         we couldn't cut a single one adrift. 

                         Not one. And there was no rafts. 

                         None. That vessel sank in twelve 

                         minutes. Yes, that's all she took.

                         guess some officers knew... was the 

                         bomb mission had been so secret, no 

                         distress signals was sent. What the 

                         men didn't know was that they wouldn't 

                         even list us as overdue for a week. 

                         Well, I didn't know that -- I wasn't 

                         an officer -- just as well perhaps. 

                         So some of us were dead already -- 

                         in the water -- just hangin' limp in 

                         our lifejackets. And several already 

                         bleedin'. And the three hundred or 

                         so laying on the bottom of the ocean. 

                         As the light went, the sharks came 

                         crusin'. We formed tight groups -- 

                         somewhat like squares in an old battle -- 

                         You know what I mean -- so that when 

                         one come close, the man nearest would 

                         yell and shout and pound the water 

                         and sometimes it worked and the fish 

                         turned away, but other times that 

                         shark would seem to look right at a 

                         man -- right into his eyes -- and in 

                         spite of all shoutin' and poundin' 

                         you'd hear that terrible high 

                         screamin' and the ocean would go 

                         red, then churn up as they ripped 

                         him.  Then we'd reform our little 

                         squares. By the first dawn the sharks 

                         had taken more than a hundred. Hard 

                         for me to count but more than a 

                         hundred. I don't know how many sharks. 

                         Maybe a thousand. I do know they 

                         averaged six men an hour. All kinds -- 

                         blues, makos, tigers. All kinds.

                              (Pause)

                         In the middle of the second day, 

                         some of us started to go crazy from 

                         the thirst. One fella cried out he 

                         saw a river, another claimed he saw 

                         a waterfall, some started to drink 

                         the ocean and choked on it, and some 

                         left our little groups -- our little 

                         squares -- and swam off alone lookin' 

                         for islands and the sharks always 

                         took them right away. It was mainly 

                         the young fellas that did that -- 

                         the older ones stayed where they 

                         was. That second day -- my life jacket 

                         rubbed me raw and that was more blood 

                         in the water. Oh my. On Thursday 

                         morning I bumped up against a friend 

                         of mine -- Herbie Robinson from 

                         Cleveland -- a bosun's mate -- it 

                         seemed he was asleep but when I 

                         reached over to waken him, he bobbed 

                         in the water and I saw his body upend 

                         because he'd been bitten in half 

                         beneath the waist. Well Chief, so it 

                         went on -- bombers high overhead but 

                         nobody noticin' us. Yes -- suicides, 

                         sharks, and all this goin' crazy and 

                         dyin' of thirst. Noon the fifth day, 

                         Mr. Hooper, a Lockheed Ventura swung 

                         around and came in low. Yes. He did 

                         that. Yes, that pilot saw us. And 

                         early evenin', a big fat PBY come 

                         down out of the sky and began the 

                         pickup.  That was when I was most 

                         frightened of all -- while I was 

                         waitin' for my turn. Just two and a 

                         half hours short of five days and 

                         five nights when they got to me and 

                         took me up. Eleven hundred of us 

                         went into that ocean -- three hundred 

                         and sixteen got out. Yeah. Nineteen 

                         hundred and forty five. June the 

                         29th.

                              (pause)

                         Anyway, we delivered the bomb.

               EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT

               Quint has just finished his story, and we are looking across 

               the quiet night sea to the Orca slowly circling in the night, 

               the warm light in the pilot house barely revealing the figures 

               of the three men inside, the red and green running lights 

               winking along the ship's flanks. We hear the distant boom 

               and drawn-out hoot of a whale.

               INT. ORCA PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

                                     BRODY

                         What the hell?

                                     HOOPER

                         It's a whale out there.

               There's a brief, eerie pause. Quint breaks the silence by 

               muttering into song, which he slowly swells.

                                     QUINT

                              (singing)

                         Show me the way to go home... I'm 

                         tired and I want to go to bed. I had 

                         a little drink about an hour ago, 

                         and it went right to my head.

                              (etc.)

               Gradually, Hooper and Brody join in, and the pilothouse 

               becomes a warm cozy place.

               EXT. OCEAN

               The Orca and its song in the night. In the foreground, the 

               barrel and strobe light flash up into view, and behind them, 

               the big dorsal fin surfaces, and glides ominously towards 

               the ship.

               INT. PILOT HOUSE

               The song is continuing, and we hear the barest hint of a 

               scraping sound from the hull deep beneath the men. Quint's 

               eyes abruptly narrow as his sensitive ears are the first to 

               hear the abrasion of his ship. Things vibrate on the shelves.

               Quint stops singing, Hooper and Brody continue a duet. The 

               scraping repeats, and Hooper now senses it. He drops out of 

               the song, leaving Brody singing solo.

                                     QUINT

                              (quietly, to Hooper)

                         Start the engines.

               As Brody hears this and is about to stop singing, the boat 

               is suddenly bumped from below, and the gentle scraping turns 

               to a violent assault somewhere on the understructure of the 

               vessel. Water bubbles up into the hold. Brody starts, and 

               looks at the radio. He is about to move towards it when 

               Quint's urgent instructions stop him.

                                     QUINT

                         He's busting the shaft! Start the 

                         pump!

                                     BRODY

                         Where...?

                                     QUINT

                         The bilge pumps. There --

               He leaves Brody in the pilot house, and runs onto the deck, 

               grabbing his M-1 rifle as he goes. Brody hits a switch and 

               we hear the pumps starting.

               ANGLE ON THE ORCA

               Hooper is on the flybridge, starting the engines, but the 

               diesels sound wrong.

                                     QUINT

                         Cut the engines!

               Hooper does.

                                     HOOPER

                         Rudder bearings?

               The boat is assaulted again. Quint fires over the stern, 

               emptying a clip into the water.

                                     QUINT

                              (to Brody)

                         Get up forward! Watch for him!

               Brody moves cautiously up to the bow.

                                     QUINT

                         Keep your eyes open, Mr. Hooper!

               Hooper stands ready on the bridge, Quint pacing the stern 

               deck.

                                     QUINT

                         Nobody sleeps! Nobody.

               He jams a fresh clip into the M-1. The men scan the seas 

               around them. Quint resumes their song, louder this time, 

               more defiant.

                                     QUINT

                              (sings)

                         Show me the way to go home... I'm 

                         tired and I want to go to bed.

                              (etc.)

               Hooper and Brody join in from their respective positions.

               EXT. OCEAN, WIDE ON THE ORCA

               The men in place, singing, the water sparkling towards the 

               horizon, the stars twinkling above. The sound of a distant 

               whale in distant counterpoint.

               EXT. THE ORCA - DAWN

               Brody is at the wheel on the flying bridge, while Hooper and 

               Quint have a hatch up on the stern, and are working together 

               to repair the damaged rudder controls torn loose by the shark. 

               Hooper is bucking the steel rod, while Quint is hammering 

               away at the joint, trying to drive a new pin.

               The engine is idling. Bits of iron clutter the deck, along 

               with a few rough, outsized tools and greasy rags and gaskets.

                                     QUINT

                         More left rudder! More! Left hand 

                         down now, Chief.

               Brody tries to comply.

                                     HOOPER

                              (shifting his grip)

                         Lemme get a better angle on it. Now.

               Quint hammers again.

                                     QUINT

                         He's bent the housing. You can hear 

                         it.

               And we can. The Orca's diesels are no longer smooth. Brody 

               suddenly sees something, and points.

               BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW - THE WATER

               The barrel is surfaced directly ahead of them, just off the 

               port side. They are drifting up to it.

                                     BRODY

                         The barrel!

               The strobe light winks at them. Quint holds up a hand:  

               "Quiet!"

               Everything stops as they watch the barrel coming slowly up 

               on them.

                                     QUINT

                         It's him.

               He takes a killing lance from the rack. Hooper gets a 

               boathook.

                                     QUINT

                         He's under the keg. Careful --

               Hooper leans out gingerly, snagging the barrel with the hook.

               It bobs lightly in the water, an innocent bystander. Hooper 

               shifts his pole, takes hold of the rope, poling it in.

                                     QUINT

                              (suspicious)

                         Easy -- just want to goose him up. 

                         The minute he runs, drop it or you'll 

                         lose your hands.

               Hooper gets the line and starts hauling it up. No resistance.

               It comes easily over the transom into a coil on the deck.  

               He and Quint exchange looks.

                                     QUINT

                         Here -- gimme. I don't see what he's 

                         been doin'.

               WATER - ANGLE

               Both men are draped over the side, their chins almost touching 

               the water on the aft side. From the opposite starboard 

               direction, fully unfastened from the barrel, comes the Great 

               White. First the fin, then the conical nose and the upper 

               border of wide, grinning teeth. It knifes through the water 

               in absolute silence, propelling itself with tremendous speed 

               toward the unsuspecting men.

               CLOSE - BRODY

               His instincts shine -- as does his newly-acquired sense of 

               direction.

                                     BRODY

                              (top of his lungs)

                         Shark! Starboard!

               CLOSE - HOOPER AND QUINT

               They turn just in time, and a long spine-stretch saves them 

               from instant decapitation. The Great White passes the transom, 

               the harpoon still in its side and trailing five feet of chewed-

               off cable. It rolls on its side and looks at them as it 

               passes.

               Past the stern the huge tail lashes out, ripping the rope 

               out of Quint's hands, shearing a huge swath through the paint, 

               peeling it off like a plane, taking one of the bronze letters 

               out of "Orca." The shark begins an arc to sea, its fin cutting 

               the water, and starts circling the boat. Quint notices his 

               cut hand, palm bleeding, realizing how close he came to losing 

               it.

                                     QUINT

                              (to Hooper)

                         Haul in that rope -- it'll foul us!

                              (then to Brody on the 

                              bridge)

                         Start the engine!

               The diesels start with a terrible grinding.

                                     QUINT

                         Easy! It'll tear right out!

                                     HOOPER

                              (hauling)

                         The shaft is giving.

               Hooper slams the hatch, kicks the tools to one side, clearing 

               the deck for action once again.

                                     BRODY

                              (on bridge)

                         That's it! Radio in for help!

                                     QUINT

                         Shut up! Just pump her out!

                                     BRODY

                              (coming down off the 

                              bridge)

                         Yeah, Captain, as soon as I make a 

                         call.

               Brody heads for the radio in the pilot house.

               QUINT - CLOSE

               A perfectly terrible look comes over him. He raises up and 

               starts after Brody. Brody disappears into the cabin. Quint 

               pauses outside and sees:

               INSERT - QUINT'S LEAD-CENTERED BASEBALL BAT

               his calloused hand grabs it up fiercely.

               INT. RADIO SHACK

               Brody picks up the radio, flicking on knobs and lights on 

               the complex console.

                                     QUINT (O.S.)

                         Beg your pardon --

               ANGLE - DOORWAY

               Quint appears, silhouetted in the hot light of the door, 

               raising his bat.

                                     QUINT

                         Duty first and pleasure after --

               CLOSE - BRODY

               looking up in horror, covering his face.

               CLOSE - QUINT

               Quint brings down the bat with all the strength he can summon.

               Crash!

               Sparks fly, lights blink and go out, plastic and sections of 

               metal ricochet all over the cabin as Quint demolishes the 

               ship-to-shore radio.

               Quint takes a happy breath, winks at Brody and hands him the 

               bat.

                                     QUINT

                         Excuse me!

               Brody's adrenaline turns his fear into rage. His glasses are 

               cracked or broken by flying pieces of radio. He seizes the 

               bat, and pound the shattered radio for emphasis.

                                     BRODY

                         Some great idea! Now where are we?  

                         Some goddamn skipper you are. You're 

                         certifiable, y'know that? You're a 

                         real treat! Certifiable! Bananas!

               His tirade is interrupted by an urgent bellow from Hooper.

               CLOSE - HOOPER

               Pointing at the fin.

                                     HOOPER

                         Coming right to us!

                                     QUINT

                         No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead, 

                         he'll hit us head on --

                              (the engine clanks)

                         Slower! Throttle back ---

               ANGLE - OVER THE BOW

                                     QUINT

                              (raising harpoon)

                         Hard to port!

               Hooper pulls the boat into a tight turn and Quint has a shot 

               at the upward rolling flank. He sinks it with careful 

               precision.

                                     QUINT

                         Try shakin' that out!

               Brody emerges from the cabin as the rope zips overboard, and 

               the barrel, changing over, catapults into the air before 

               plunging into the ocean in a cloudy splash.

                                     BRODY

                              (shouting to Quint)

                         Did you get him in the head?

                                     QUINT

                              (to Brody)

                         No! No! No!

                              (to Hooper)

                         Swing around! After him!

               ON THE FLYBRIDGE

               Hooper can see the fin racing ahead of the barrel. Diving 

               down. Up again -- Quint prepares another iron. Brody is 

               digging in his bag. He comes up with his 2" .357 service 

               revolver.

                                     QUINT

                         More gas... go to half! Get me right 

                         alongside him --

               The engine thuds and knocks.

                                     HOOPER

                              (shouting down)

                         We can't rev it up this high --

               Suddenly the barrel gongs into the side of the Orca.

                                     QUINT

                         Watch it!

               Hooper skillfully avoids the speeding rope.

                                     QUINT

                         Atta boy!

               Quint leans to one side, harpoon over his head. The Great 

               White breaks water and...

                                     QUINT

                         Take two, they're small!

               He sinks it deep. We hear shots. As the new rope whips out, 

               Brody can be seen standing on the gunwale, in regulation 

               police combat pistol stance, holding his .357 in both hands, 

               firing at the shark's head.

               Quint shakes his head in amused disbelief at this, as the 

               barrel goes over.

                                     HOOPER

                              (shouting at Brody)

                         Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy 

                         on his own blood already!

                                     BRODY

                         I can't stand here doing nothing!

                                     QUINT

                         Order in the court!

               WATER LEVEL ANGLE

               He has seen the two barrels pop to the surface.

                                     QUINT

                              (racing over)

                         Three'll do it! He's havin' trouble 

                         with two!

               He yells to Hooper and Brody as he swings behind the controls.

                                     QUINT

                         Grab yourselves a couple of poles!

               Quint steers "Slow Ahead," engine protesting, as he maneuvers 

               toward the moving barrels. Quint peers down, steering closer 

               and closer.

                                     QUINT

                         Get ready! Now snag 'em!

               Together Brody and Hooper hook a barrel-rope and hold on for 

               dear life as the shark changes course.

                                     QUINT

                         Pull in the ropes and tie 'em onto 

                         the transom -- free ride.

               Brody and Hooper pull in with all they are worth as Quint 

               helps out by wheeling in a circle. He laughs to himself, 

               enjoying the spectacle.

               CLOSE - HOOPER

               securing the rope to a cleat but allowing the barrel to hang 

               overboard. Brody ties his now-perfect bowline adjacent cleat.

               WIDE ANGLE - ORCA

               The boat is jarred violently from side to side as the 

               underwater force of the Great White jerks and heaves them to 

               and fro, up and down, side to side...

               ANGLE - HOOPER AND BRODY

               are both torn off their feet as the boat is thrust forward.

               FLYBRIDGE - QUINT

               sees the fin ahead. It is pulling the boat.

                                     QUINT

                         Get tired! That's the idea! Here's a 

                         little reverse for you!

               The shark leaps partially out of the water, and the sight is 

               both horrifying and awesome. Its jaws break water, snapping 

               at the ropes that have him snarled and frustrated.

               Quint throws the Orca into neutral and shouts down:

                                     QUINT

                         Haul in -- watch the prop!

               With that, Quint slides down to the prow, putting another 

               shaft onto his gun, finding satisfaction in its heft and 

               balance. The shark can be seen directly ahead, threshing 

               closer.

                                     QUINT

                         Now! Untie 'em! Quick! He'll tear us 

                         to pieces.

               He fires the iron, and the shark veers downward in a gushing 

               shower of spray.

               HOOPER AND BRODY

               They are trying to untie from the cleats, but both ropes are 

               stretched too taut. They jump out of the way, falling flat

               on the deck as the ropes sweep over them, knocking over 

               objects, skeetering across the deck. A tight jerking motion, 

               and the Orca is dragged through the water -- backwards. And 

               much too fast. Water is splashing up over the transom in its 

               backward wake. The engines groan and complain.

                                     QUINT

                         Damn head is too far away. He's too 

                         big.

               Wrenched to one side, Quint is knocked from his feet.

               CLOSE - THE TWO CLEATS

               A moment of slackness, and then a great surge of raw strength.

               The rope snaps the cleats off, screws and splintered wood 

               spraying -- and the barrels fly over the water. They disappear 

               beneath the turbulent grey surface.

               The three men, breathing heavily, bruised and pouring sweat, 

               look out at the blank water.

               ANGLE - OCEAN

               Pop -- pop -- pop. One, two, three, the barrels surface -- 

               ready for more.

                                     QUINT

                              (amazed at the shark's 

                              strength)

                         He can't go so deep. Not with all 

                         those on him.

               Brody looks down at his feet. There is salt water up to their 

               shoe tops.

                                     BRODY

                         What about us?

                                     QUINT

                              (mentally assessing 

                              the damage)

                         Have to pump her steady, s'all.

               The barrels start a wide circle, each cuts through the water, 

               pushing a wave before it and leaving a wake behind.

                                     QUINT

                              (to Hooper)

                         Follow him --

                              (to Brody)

                         You start pumpin' out here.

               Quint tosses Brody the hand pump, then picks up his M-1, and 

               checks the load.

                                     HOOPER (O.S.)

                              (on bridge)

                         He's heading under -- !

                                     QUINT

                              (incredulously)

                         No way! He can't!

               ANGLE - OCEAN

               The barrels approaching the Orca dip below the surface, one -- 

               two -- three.

                                     BRODY

                         Where'd he go?

               Brody looks around. Hooper on the flying bridge searching in 

               all directions. Quint is looking more appalled every second.

                                     QUINT

                              (helplessly)

                         He can't stay down with three barrels 

                         on him! Where is he?!

                                     BRODY

                         Have you ever had one do this?

                                     QUINT

                              (and he means this)

                         No!

               Booming thud at the keel. Brody slides on the wet deck and 

               Quint loses his footing, falling into Brody's arms.

               WITH HOOPER ON THE FLY BRIDGE

               It seems the only place out of reach of the shark. Quint 

               climbs up, Brody following him, reloading his pistol.

               Just then, the barrels pop up ahead, veer left, and duck 

               under.

                                     QUINT

                         Follow him!

                                     HOOPER

                         He's under!

               BRODY AND HIS POINT OF VIEW

                                     BRODY

                         There!

                              (points wildly)

               The barrels have surfaced and we see the monster shadow 

               sliding under the Orca, seemingly endless. Violent scraping 

               sounds.

                                     BRODY

                         He's trying to sink us!

                                     QUINT

                              (to Hooper)

                         Dead astern! Zig-zag!

               Quint is grimly silent. Brody senses that Quint is in the 

               fight of (and for) his life.

               The Orca taking evasive action. But the three barrels are 

               closing the gap, the engines coughing and missing, destroying 

               themselves with every rotation of the damaged shaft.

                         BRODY

                 He's chasing us! I 

                 don't believe it. 

                                                       QUINT

                                               Full throttle! To port!

               ANGLE ON THE BRIDGE

               Hooper is jamming the throttle forward, but the engine is 

               pounding and knocking wildly. The barrels circle and move 

               in. Quint has his rifle ready.

                                     HOOPER

                              (suddenly giving Quint 

                              the wheel)

                         Hold her.

               He leaps to his gear, trying desperately to get his dart 

               gun.

               Just then, the shark attacks, breaking water and rising over 

               the boat like a rocket; snout, jaws, pectoral fins, belly, 

               falling sideways. A vast spray drenches the men. Quint fires 

               into the belly, the bullets pocking the smooth whiteness.

                                     HOOPER

                              (loading)

                         Keep him there! Keep him!

               The Orca shudders from side to side. From Hooper's point of 

               view we can the shark gripping the transom in his jaws, 

               shaking the boat as he saws his massive head from side to 

               side, trying to tear a chunk out of the very hull. Quint has 

               reloaded and is firing into the fish. Brody has a wicked 

               pointed gaff, and is swinging wildly at the snout, gashing 

               and gouging it, trying for the eyes. The killing lust is on 

               all three men.

                                     QUINT

                         Throttling back!

               The boat surges, the shark gives a final unbalances wrench, 

               and disengages. The dorsal fin circles off, beginning a wide 

               loop around the boat.

               The engine quivers and dies, the boat without power, rolling 

               half awash, a wounded victim.

               The fin dips, the barrels follow, the shark disappears beneath 

               the waves. There is complete silence.

               THE THREE MEN ON DECK

               In the dead quiet, we can hear the lap of waves against the 

               hull, the hoarse panting breathing of the men, the pings and 

               pops of the cooling, dying engines.

               QUINT AND THE TRANSOM

               He eyes the stern. Huge cracks and broken timber testify to 

               the fury of the attack.

                                     QUINT

                              (very quietly, to 

                              Hooper)

                         What can that gun of yours do?

                                     HOOPER

                         Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine 

                         nitrate. If I can hit him. I can 

                         kill him. But I gotta be close.  

                         Very close.

                                     BRODY

                              (the awful realization)

                         You gotta go in the water...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ON DECK, LATER

               Quint and Hooper are assembling the shark cage, its shiny 

               bars the only undamaged things on deck. Brody is working 

               too, bolting the sections together.

                                     HOOPER

                              (in command now)

                         Rig the cable to the roof eyebolts.

               The men are speaking in near whispers, quiet in the silence 

               that surrounds them. Hooper is in his wet suit, adjusting 

               weights, mask, tanks, etc. The cage is standing in the stern.

               Quint runs a line from the gin pole to the roof section.

               Hooper climbs in though the top.

                                     HOOPER

                         Take me up.

               Brody cranks the winch, hoisting cage and Hooper into the 

               air. Quint balances the gin pole lines, Hooper crouching in 

               the cage, examining it for stresses; satisfied, he holds out 

               his hand. Quint puts the spear gun into it.

               CLOSE ON HOOPER IN THE CAGE

               He examines his weapon, checking the power load, with the 

               big wicked-looking syringe head uncapped to reveal its razor 

               point.

                                     HOOPER

                         Lower away, Chief.

                              (then, to Quint)

                         Try and keep him off me till I'm 

                         under.

               Hooper inside, looking out the bars of the cage, gives Brody 

               a reassuring smile, then pops his mouthpiece between his 

               teeth and checks his regulator. Brody steps back, and with 

               Quint guiding the cage, begins lowering it off the gin pole 

               boom arm into the sea alongside the boat.

               Brody and Hooper stare at each another as their faces pass, 

               Hooper sliding down into the cold grey ocean.

               As Hooper disappears beneath the surface, Quint and Brody 

               exchange a long look between them.

               UNDERWATER - CAGE

               HOOPER'S POINT OF VIEW

               Submerging. The sky, horizon, water line, clean fresh sea 

               air then... the magnificent innerspaces, with bubbles 

               sparkling in front of us.

               ANGLE - HOOPER IN THE CAGE

               as he floats to twenty feet Hooper never stops looking around 

               360 degrees. He removes the rubber guard from the needle and 

               waits.

               EXT. THE SURFACE - BRODY AND QUINT

               Their turning heads tell us that the barrels are still 

               circling.

               Suddenly, both heads stop turning.

               THE SEA

               The barrels have come to a stop. Delicately, they change 

               course and meander toward the lowered cage.

               UNDERWATER - HOOPER

               His back is to us. He is just now completing a visual sweep 

               and turns, eyes front into closeup and: fixes wildly on 

               something monstrous... and fascinating.

               HOOPER'S POINT OF VIEW

               The water is clear and shafts of sunlight streak downward in 

               the blue. From the deep gloom -- diving slowly, smoothly -- 

               comes the shark. It moves with no apparent effort, sinuous 

               beyond comparison. As it nears the cage, it turns, and its 

               ghastly length passes right in front of him: first the snout, 

               then the jaw, slack and smiling, then the black eye.

               Hooper tentatively reaches out. It is too far for the 

               strychnine pole. The vinyl flesh is pocked with bullet holes, 

               iron scars, gaffing hooks and strange open wounds that tinge 

               the passing currents with pink.

               SURFACE

               The trailing barrels gong and scratch the keel of the Orca 

               above. Brody and Quint leap back.

               HOOPER - CLOSE

               The shark has vanished into a cloud of rising silt. Hooper, 

               expecting the shark to attack out of that same general 

               direction, braces himself, pole extended through the bars, 

               breathing faster, straining his eyes into the gloom and... 

               we see that the shark attacking from behind him.

               The cage is sent careening. Hooper grabs the bars for dear 

               life. The shark has grabbed the steel struts in its brutal 

               jaws, shaking the cage relentlessly from side to side, bending 

               the bars like clothes hangers. Hooper can't turn the pointed 

               end of the pole around, his body jammed as far away from the 

               non-rational attacker as possible.

               Hooper is trapped.

               The shark withdraws to get some running room then charges 

               again. The bleeding snout thrust deeper into the yawing bars, 

               the jaws snapping and twisting, two feet from Hooper's torso, 

               the tail thrusting it forward. Hooper drops the strychnine 

               pole between the bars and it tumbles slowly toward rapture 

               depth.

               All the shark needs is one more good thrust before separating 

               Hooper at the waistline. Through frantic bubbles Hooper 

               fumbles with the overhead hatch cover, kicking up and out of 

               the cage. The shark backpedals with its tail, but the broad 

               head won't shake loose.

               Hooper rushes downwards, after the strychnine pole.

               ANGLE - SHARK

               The shark twists free of the cage and arrows downward after 

               Hooper.

               Hooper nearly recovers the pole. Again it slips from his 

               frightened grasp and this time disappears into a narrow abyss.  

               Hooper turns and looks up.

               The Great White is lunging at him, twenty feet above.

               SURFACE

               One of the barrel ropes snakes around the cage rope and pulls 

               taut.

               HOOPER - DEEP

               Turning to meet the monster which -- though held back for a 

               moment by the snarled rope -- now surges forward.

               SURFACE - BRODY AND QUINT

               The Orca is listing dangerously aft, the ginpole bent almost 

               to the breaking point. Brody is in a frenzy trying to haul 

               up the cage. Quint attaches the end of Brody's rope to a 

               hand-winch. The ginpole is splitting.

                                     QUINT

                         Let go of it!

               The pole gives way, the rope whipping down on the gunwale... 

               the pulling of the tonnage below is tipping the Orca, dragging 

               it, but Quint won't give up the winch. Brody hauls on the 

               rope barehanded.

               UNDERWATER - HOOPER

               maneuvering downward, away from the jaws... Suddenly the 

               crazed shark veers upward for the surface.

               SURFACE - QUINT

               The winch is working faster now, Quint demonically winding 

               it in. The crushed cage bangs against the hull then breaks 

               water.

               Brody is horrified. The cage is empty!

                         QUINT

                    (a horrible scream)

                 He's comin' up -- !

                                                       BRODY

                                               He's taken him!

               MASTER ANGLE

               The shark breaks water right beside the Orca, rising with a 

               great whooshing noise. It rises vertically, towering overhead, 

               blocking out the sun. The pectoral fins seem to reach forward.  

               The shark, in all of its monstrous glory, falls onto the 

               stern of the boat with a shattering crash, narrowly missing 

               Quint and Brody. It drives the stern underwater, the ocean 

               pours in over the transom. The jaws snap from side to side.  

               Brody flounders backwards away from it.

               CLOSE - BRODY

               He is clinging to the mast for dear life, as the ship begins 

               to tilt to stern, and everything starts to break loose around 

               him.

               NIGHTMARE ANGLE - DECK OF THE ORCA

               The giant jaws are snapping irresistibly at everything: great 

               chunks of wood torn out of the deck and superstructure.

               Deck chair, irons, rope, gear, beercans, bottles, Brody's 

               bag, all are food for the insatiable maw blindly churning 

               away.

               Quint is clinging next to a rack of lances: he is enraged at 

               this ultimate violation of his territory. He snatches up a 

               lance and hurls himself at the shark with a wordless bellow.

               The great head weaves side to side, the deck is at a 

               treacherous incline, slippery with blood and seawater. Quint's 

               footing falters and slips, he stumbles at the Mouth of Hell, 

               the big teeth seize him and snap.

               Quint's roar of rage and pain is choked off as his body is 

               clamped between the grinding, sawing teeth, and his head and 

               legs suddenly contort as the shark's teeth meet across his 

               torso. Blood gushes onto the deck. The remnants of his body 

               tumble from the shark's mouth.

               Brody sees the horror, hears the screams -- in his 

               desperation, he tears loose one of Hooper's remaining air 

               tanks, and hurls it at the monster. It tumbles into the bloody 

               well, wedging across the back of the mouth, the thick steel 

               blocking the cruel jaws.

               The shark's head shakes even more violently, trying to clear 

               the cold iron, but the tank is in to stay.

               DECK OF THE ORCA, LISTING BADLY

               To avoid sliding into the jaws, Brody scrambles on the titling 

               deck, bracing himself in the cabin door to avoid pitching 

               down into the bloody mouth. He fights his way into the cabin, 

               already a shambles.

               Below him, on the deck, the shark lunges again, shifting 

               weight so that the boat in now stern down, and listing to 

               the side. Water from the sea pours into the cabin.

               Another lunge by the shark. The huge snout and jaws slam up 

               against the doorframe, blocking escape, bloody, gnashing.

               More seawater. To stay in the cabin is to go down with the 

               ship.

               Brody clambers as far from the shark as he can, against the 

               forward wall of the pilothouse. He sees the window Hooper 

               used before. It's blocked by barrels and debris. He breaks 

               the side window highest above the water, edges out onto the 

               battered bridge.

               The shark rolls around, now half in the water. The ship is 

               sinking, the sea is not a viable alternative. Brody climbs 

               up into the flying bridge.

               The shark is still lunging and snapping. Brody is forced to 

               climb higher and higher as the ship slowly sinks beneath 

               him.

               CLOSE - BRODY

               He scrambles for his life onto the flying bridge, sees the M-

               1 stuck there, seizes it.

               OVER BRODY, LOOKING DOWN AT THE STERN

               He is bracing himself, aiming the rifle, taking a bead on 

               the steel tanks, silver gleaming in the bloody shark's mouth.  

               He fires. And fires. Bullets shatter the shark's teeth, 

               punching holes in the dripping snout.

               WIDE ON THE ORCA  EXPLOSION

               With a muffled boom, the perfect symmetry of the shark is 

               suddenly blown apart in a geyser of steel and blood as Brody's 

               shot hits the pressurized tank. A 30-foot cloud of water, 

               steel, shark and debris covers the sky.

               A gigantic convulsion hurls the Great White's mangled body 

               into the sea. The Orca slowly begins to turn over in its 

               death roll.

               UNDERWATER

               The shark's carcass floating down in a cloud of blood and 

               debris.

               A shadow clouds the waters, and the Orca's mass begins to 

               slip into the frame.

               CLOSE - HOOPER

               Emerging from beneath the surface, he raises his mask, spits 

               out his mouthpiece and kicks toward Brody.

               SURFACE - BRODY AND HOOPER

               Brody is holding onto a cushion, barely afloat, relieved the 

               shark is dead, yet stunned to see Hooper is still alive. The 

               two men share weak laughter, which soon trails off.

                                     HOOPER

                         Quint...?

                                     BRODY

                         No...

                              (notices something 

                              O.S.)

                         You think we can get back with those?

               SURFACE - BRODY AND HOOPER - ANOTHER ANGLE

               They swim through the debris, using two barrels as floats, 

               as dozens of seagulls feast on shark remains on the surface.

                                     BRODY

                         What day is this?

                                     HOOPER

                         Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I 

                         think.

                                     BRODY

                         Think the tide's with us?

                                     HOOPER

                         Just keep kicking.

                                     BRODY

                         Y'know, I used to hate the water...

                                     HOOPER

                         I can't imagine why.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               HIGH SHOT FROM SHORE

               The two tiny, miserable heroes swim ashore as the credits 

               roll.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END
