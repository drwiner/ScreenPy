          "And there came a day, a day unlike any other, when Earth's

          mightiest heroes and heroines found themselves united against a

          common threat. On that day, the Avengers were born--to fight the

          foes no single superhero could withstand! Through the years,

          their roster has prospered, changing many times, but their glory

          has never been denied! Heed the call, then--for now, the Avengers

          Assemble!"

          BURNING BLUE FLAMES. A smoky cube shape emerges - THE TESSERACT.

          Filling the screen with BLACKNESS.

          EXT. THRONE ROOM, SPACE  NIGHT

          Kneeling behind a THRONE, a CLOTHED, ARMORED FIGURE known as THE

          OTHER, bows.

           THE OTHER (V.O.)

           The Tesseract has awakened. It is on a

           little world. A human world. They would

           wield its power,...

                          CUT TO:

          THE OTHER faces a HORNED SHAPED SHADOW. LOKI. Loki is handed the

          CHITAURI SCEPTER, a long golden handle, fitted with a blue gem

          encircled with silver blades.

           THE OTHER (V.O.)

           But our ally knows its workings as they

           never will. He is ready to lead. And

           our force, our Chitauri, will follow.

          HIGH WIDE ON: TENS OF THOUSANDS of CHITAURI stand ready in a

          seething mass of neat rows and columns....the ground simply

          QUAKES.

           THE OTHER (V.O.)

           The world will be his. The universe

           yours. And the humans, what can they do

           but burn?

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. S.H.I.E.L.D. PROJECT P.E.G.A.S.U.S FACILITY  NIGHT

          Out in the NEW MEXICO desert, a remote research facility is in a

          state of panic. It's an evacuation. A SWOOPING helicopter flies

          in.

          CHAOS. Men in suits run around like in the typical `we have to

          leave' fashion. Soldiers on foot jump onto Humvees, accelerating

          the hell out of there. A VOICE bellows from hidden loudspeakers.

          EXT. HELICOPTER PAD  CONTINUOUS

          Standing a few yards from the landing pad, A Fed in a suit with

          badass shades, peers at the helicopter as it lands. This is

          SHIELD AGENT PHIL COULSON.

          Walking out of the helicopter is SHIELD AGENT MARIA HILL, SEXY,

          FIERCE AND DETERMINED. Following her, SHIELD DIRECTOR NICK FURY

          climbs out. Hill and Fury approach Agent Coulson.

                          NICK FURY

           How bad is it?

                       AGENT PHIL COULSON

           That's the problem, sir. We don't know.

          INT. FACILITY FLOOR  NIGHT

          Agent Coulson leads Hill and Fury through the radiation section

          of the facility. Hundreds of technicians and other staff run

          around, taking only the essentials.

                       AGENT PHIL COULSON

           Dr. Selvig read an energy surge from

           the Tesseract four hours ago.

                          NICK FURY

           NASA didn't authorize Selvig to test

           phase.

                        AGENT PHIL COULSON

           He wasn't testing it, he wasn't even in

           the room. Spontaneous advancement.

                        AGENT MARIA HILL

           It just turned itself on?

                          NICK FURY

           What are the energy levels now?

                        AGENT PHIL COULSON

           Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it

           down, we ordered the evac.

                          NICK FURY

           How long to get everyone out?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           Campus should be clear in the next half

           hour.

                          NICK FURY

           Do better.

          CONTINUOUSLY HEADING DOWN TO RADIATION FACILITY FLOOR

                         AGENT MARIA HILL

           Sir, evacuation may be futile.

                          NICK FURY

           We should tell them to go back to

           sleep?

                         AGENT MARIA HILL

           If we can't control the Tesseract's

           energy, there may not be a minimum safe

           distance.

                          NICK FURY

           I need you to make sure that PHASE 2

           prototypes are shipped out.

                          AGENT MARIA HILL

           Sir, is that really a priority right

           now?

                          NICK FURY

           Until such time as the world ends, we

           will act as though it intends to spin

           on. Clear out the tech below. Every

           piece of PHASE 2 on a truck and gone.

                          AGENT MARIA HILL

           Yes, sir.

           (to standing agents)

           With me.

          INT. NASA SPACE RADIATION FACILITY, VACUUM CHAMBER  CONTINUOUS

          Fury enters the lab facility where the Tesseract is being held

          by a COMPACT MUON SOLENOID COIL CHAMBER.

                          NICK FURY

           Talk to me, doctor.

          DR. ERIK SELVIG emerges from behind the CMS machine, concerned.

          The Tesseract is glowing unusually brighter and flare rings

          shoot out at random.

                          SELVIG

           Director.

                          NICK FURY

           Is there anything we know for certain?

                          SELVIG

           Tesseract is misbehaving.

                          NICK FURY

           Is that supposed to be funny?

                          SELVIG

           No, it's not funny at all. The

           Tesseract is not only active,

           she's...misbehaving.

                          NICK FURY

           How soon until you pull the plug?

                          SELVIG

           She's an energy source. If we turn off

           the power, she turns it back on. If she

           reaches peak level...

                          NICK FURY

           We've prepared for this, doctor.

           Harnessing energy from space.

                          SELVIG

           We don't have the harness. Our

           calculations are far from complete. Now

           she's throwing off interference,

           radiation. Nothing harmful, low levels

           of gamma radiation.

                          NICK FURY

           That can be harmful. Where's Barton?

                          SELVIG

           The Hawk? Up in his nest, as usual.

          We see CLINT BARTON, dressed in black tactical gear, is up on

          the railings watching them below, Fury calls Barton on his

          earpiece.

                          NICK FURY

           Agent Barton, report.

          BARTON rappels down from the catwalk. Walks up to Fury. They

          both walk around the facility in a discreet manner.

                          NICK FURY

           I gave you this detail so you could

           keep a close eye on things.

                          CLINT BARTON

           Well, I see better from a distance.

                          NICK FURY

           Are you seeing anything that might set

           this thing off?

                          NASA SCIENTIST

                          (TO SELVIG)

           Doctor, it's spiking again.

                          CLINT BARTON

           No one's come or gone. It's oven is

           clean. No contacts, no I.M.'s. If there

           was any tampering, sir, it wasn't at

           this end.

                          NICK FURY

           At this end?

                          CLINT BARTON

           Yeah, the cube is a doorway to the

           other end of space, right? The doors

           open from both sides.

          DR. SELVIG clacks away at the keyboard and sees on the

          monitoring his worst nightmares. Suddenly- the Tesseract

          THUNDERS and SHAKES the entire facility. Big enough where both

          Agents Hill and Coulson can feel and they're at different ends

          of the facility.

          The flaring rings and glow of the cube spout out brighter and

          louder, like a boiling pot of water. The Tesseract's energy

          builds up into a BEAM much like the Bifrost Bridge, which HITS

          at the end of a platform that is wired to the CMS device. The

          great maelstrom beam FIRES the TESSERACT energy. The beam then

          forms a VORTEX, which then opens up a PORTAL.

          A BLACK HOLE IS CREATED. From the portal, the blackness of

          SPACE, beautiful and mysterious, strewn with a billion stars

          appears and a GUST of BLUE ENERGY CLOUDS fill the room, blinding

          everyone.

          The Tesseract's energy forms into a cloud that reaches to the

          top the facility's vacuum chamber ceiling. It's abnormally

          quiet. Then... HEAVY BREATHING is heard from the platform.

          SHIELD GUARDS slowly approach, weapons in hands. A figure is

          kneeling on the platform, smoke coming off it. It's LOKI.

          Smiling in his mischievous manner, he raises his head. The smile

          dies down. He looks deep into the eyes of Fury, Barton and

          Selvig. He stands up, holing the scepter.

                          NICK FURY

           Sir, please put down the spear!

          Loki looks at his spear then suddenly points it at where Fury

          and Barton are standing and SHOOTS OUT A BLUE EXPLODING LIGHT

          TOWARDS THEM. BARTON TACKLES Fury and they both barely miss

          Loki's fired shot.

          ALL HELL BREAKS. Machine gun fire is shot at Loki, but the

          bullets bounce off him like a boss. Loki jumps high from the

          platform and ATTACKS those firing at him.

          In the blink of an eye, Loki takes down several guards with his

          KNIVES and ENERGY BLASTS from the scepter. He stops and waits to

          see who will attack him next. Honestly, the whole lab has almost

          gone to shit.

          Barton tries to stand up. Loki quickly walks towards him. Barton

          raises his gun, but Loki grabs Barton's hand.

                          LOKI

           You have heart.

          Loki points the head of his spear at Barton's head. Barton's

          eyes suddenly glow BLACK. The ability to control Barton's mind

          is now in Loki's hand. Barton puts his piece away and stands

          straight.

          As Loki is busy using his abilities to control the minds of

          several S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel, Fury takes the Tesseract,

          placing it back into its case and tries to leave the lab.Then...

                          LOKI

           Please don't. I still need that.

                          NICK FURY

                          (TURNING)

           This doesn't have to get any messier.

                          LOKI

           Of course it does. I've come too far

           for anything else. I am Loki of Asgard,

           and I am burdened with glorious

           purpose.

                          SELVIG

           Loki? Brother of Thor?

                          NICK FURY

           We have no quarrel with your people.

                          LOKI

           An ant has no quarrel with a boot.

                          NICK FURY

           You planning to step on us?

                          LOKI

           I come with glad tidings, of a world

           made free.

                          NICK FURY

           Free from what?

                          LOKI

           Freedom. Freedom is life's great lie.

           Once you accept that, in your heart...

          Like a gunslinger, Loki turns to face Selvig who's

          standingbehind him and places his spear against Selvig's heart.

          Selvig's eyes glow BLACK.

                          LOKI

           You will know peace.

                          NICK FURY

           Yeah, you say peace, I kind of think

           you mean the other thing.

          From the vacuum chamber ceiling, Tesseract's energy cloud

          RAPIDLY builds into what may be an implosion.

                          CLINT BARTON

           Sir, Director Fury is stalling. This

           place is about to blow. Drop a hundred

           feet of rock on us. He means to bury

           us.

                          NICK FURY

           Like The Pharaohs of Odin.

                          SELVIG

           He's right. The portal is collapsing in

           on itself. You got maybe two minutes

           before this goes critical.

                          LOKI

           Well, then...

          Loki, looking at Barton, who doesn't even hesitate, SHOOTS FURY

          WHO FALLS TO THE GROUND. Barton grabs the case containing the

          Tesseract and leaves the lab with Loki, Selvig and the other

          S.H.I.E.L.D personnel Loki is controlling.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S BUNKER, ENTRANCE OF EXITING TUNNEL  NIGHT

          Loki, Barton, Selvig and the other S.H.I.E.L.D personnel are in

          the parking lot of the facility, quickly gathering certain

          weapons. Agent Hill watches in confusion, referring to Loki.

                          CLINT BARTON

           (pointing to the Loki team)

           Need these vehicles.

           AGENT MARIA HILL

           Who's that?

                          CLINT BARTON

           He didn't tell me.

          Agent Hill looks suspiciously at them as they get into the truck

          and turns to leave, as she's walking away...

                          NICK FURY

           (through the walkie talkie)

           Hill, do you copy?!

          Loki and Barton SHARPLY look at Agent Hill.

          BACK AT THE LAB

          Fury is sitting up, pulling out the bullet, breathing heavily.

                          NICK FURY

           Barton is...

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S BUNKER  NIGHT

          Suddenly, Hill turns to SHOOT AT BARTON, but Barton is already

          POINTING HIS GUN at her and starts SHOOTING, he moves the

          driver's seat of the truck and DRIVES OFF as Hill keeps

          shooting.

          BACK AT THE LAB

          Fury is holding his side, running.

                          NICK FURY

           He's got the Tesseract! Track it down!

          The energy is really brewing a fucking shit storm from the

          vacuum chamber ceiling.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S BUNKER/TUNNEL  NIGHT

          Agent Hill SLIPS into a JEEP and follows after Barton's

          truck.Loki's trucks SCREECH across the tunnel. Several SHIELD

          trucks pull up to them. A drive-by shooting ensues.

          Loki, who stands on top of the bed of the truck, uses his

          scepter and EMITS energy blasts, flipping over SHIELD trucks.

          They get in, the cars roar out after them. Agent Hill puts

          herself at a distance.

          INT. FACILITY FLOOR  NIGHT

          Fury races out of the hallway, avoiding falling pipes. The

          entire facility is now in a full earthquake.

          INT. FACILITY FLOOR, ELSEWHERE  CONTINUOUS

          Agent Coulson and several SHIELD agents fall down the steps,

          dropping SILVER CASES of information. They attempt to grab them,

          but...

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           No! Leave it!

          They run out of there like a bat from hell.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL  NIGHT

          Agent Hill's JEEP ROARS out of a side of Barton's truck and

          pulls up alongside them on the left. She goes way ahead and

          pulls her brake, swerving into a 360, facing Barton's truck and

          driving in reverse.

          Barton's ARMS reach out the open window and OPENS FIRE. Agent

          Hill figures `fuck it' and SHOOTS her windshield OPENING FIRE on

          Barton.

          EXT. VAN  NIGHT

          Agent Coulson jumps into a SHIELD VAN. On his walkie:

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           You're clear, sir! You need to go!

          EXT. HELICOPTER PAD  CONTINUOUS

          Fury BOLTS out of the facility and jumps into a helicopter. The

          surface of the pad gives way, PLUNGING the helicopter through

          the surface. But Fury's chopper BARELY makes it out.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL  NIGHT

          Still in a chase and drive-by sequence, Barton's pushes the

          pedal harder, which causes Agent Hill's JEEP to WOBBLE out and

          put her back behind.

          INT. RADIATION FACILITY, VACUUM CHAMBER  NIGHT

          The Tesseract's energy cloud now SHRINKS into a SMALL BALL OF

          WHITE LIGHT. Then...

          A CLOUD OF BLUE LIGHT CONSUMES THE ENTIRE FACILITY AND PARTS OF

          THE DESERT. Fury watches from below, a RAPID build-up into what

          may be an implosion. Several miles away, Agent Coulson's van

          feels a JOLT of the Tesseract's BLASTWAVE. THE ENTIRE FACILITY

          SWALLOWS INTO ITSELF-- A TERRIFYING, UNIMAGINABLE IMPLOSION.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL  NIGHT

          The BLASTWAVE of the Tesseract causes the tunnel to cave it.

          Like an ocean wave, blinding crumbles of falling rock, fall onto

          Agent Hill's JEEP, leaving her NEARLY trapped under this blanket

          of rock.

          On the Barton's truck, they escape the tunnel and drive into the

          desert landscape. Fury's helicopter ROARS over Barton's truck.

          Loki looks up.

          From the chopper's door, it slides open and Fury stands there,

          holding a gun, SHOOTING at Barton's, giving an honoring image of

          JULES WINNFIELD.

          Loki looks at Fury and in a fit of RAGE, points his scepter

          SHOOTS OUT THE BLUE LIGHT. The chopper CATCHES on fire, GOING

          DOWN in a FIERY BALL. Fury, like the boss he is, JUMPS OUT and

          touches down onto the desert floor. The chopper BARRELS along

          the ground.

          Fury, coming back to his senses, FIRES at Loki, but they're

          toofar and too late. Loki looks back, smiling. Fury stands

          there, MIND REELING. Then...

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

                          (WALKIE TALKIE)

           Director? Director Fury, do you copy?

                          NICK FURY

           The Tesseract is with the hostile

           force. I have men down. Hill?

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL  NIGHT

          Agent Hill climbs out her JEEP, which is sandwiched in, but

          luckily, not her.

           AGENT MARIA HILL

           A lot of men still under, don't know

           how many survivors.

          EXT. DESERT  NIGHT

                          NICK FURY

           Sound the general call. I want every

           living soul not working rescue looking

           for that brief case.

           AGENT MARIA HILL

                          (WALKIE TALKIE)

           Roger that.

                          NICK FURY

           Coulson, get back to base. This is a

           LEVEL SEVEN. As of right now, we are at

           war.

          A beat.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

                          (WALKIE TALKIE)

           What do we do?

          Fury stands there. Thinking. He looks up. On his face is sign of

          hope.

                         THE AVENGERS

          EXT. RUSSIA, SOLENSKI PLAZA, 3RD FLOOR  NIGHT

          Out in the outskirts, near a railroad, a still in construction

          building is being occupied by GEORGI LUCHKOV, a LARGE, RUSSIAN

          GENERAL along with his THUGS.

          TALL THUG is in the middle of a brutal beating on NATASHA

          ROMANOFF, a SLEWING, FOXY, UNBELIEVABLY SEXY SPY. He BACKHANDS

          NATASHA'S face. She feels the pain, but does not breakdown.

          LUCHKOV, smiling, walks up to her. Dialogue is in RUSSIAN.

                          LUCHKOV

           This is not how I wanted the evening to

           go.

                          NATASHA

           I know how you wanted this evening to

           go. Believe me, this is better.

                          LUCHKOV

           I'd like to know why they sent you to

           carry out a carrier, a stained glass

           and other random items.

          TALL THUG rocks her chair back, balancing her off the edge of an

          open floor. Natasha is now scared.

                          NATASHA

           I thought General Soholob was in charge

           of the export business.

                          LUCHKOV

           Soholob? Your reputation is quite a

           progression. THE FAMOUS BLACK WIDOW.

           Nothing but a pretty face.

                          NATASHA

           You really think I'm pretty?

          LUCHKOV slowly walks over to a table filled with tools. He picks

          up a pair of pliers. TALL THUG opens up her mouth wide open.

                          LUCHKOV

           We do not need the Lermontov to

           transfer the tanks. Tell him, well,...

                          (IN ENGLISH)

           You may have to write it down.

          Suddenly, WEASELLY THUG'S cell rings. Confused, he answers.

                          WEASELLY THUG

           Ya?

           (looks at LUCHKOV)

           It's for you.

          LUCHKOV takes the phone, pissed.

                          LUCHKOV

           Who the hell is...

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           You're at 114 Solenski Plaza, 3rd floor.

           We have an F22 exactly 8 miles out. Put

           the woman on the phone or I will blow

           up the block before you can make the

           lobby.

          HOLY SHIT. LUCHKOV places the cell phone against Natasha's ear

          seeing how she's tied to a chair with her hands tied behind her

          back.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           We need you to come in.

                          NATASHA

           Are you kidding? I'm working!

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           This takes precedence.

                          NATASHA

           I'm in the middle of an interrogation

           and this moron is giving me everything.

                          LUCHKOV

           I don't give everything.

          Natasha gives him a look.

                          NATASHA

           Look, you can't pull me out of this

           right now.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           Natasha. Barton's been compromised.

          A beat.

                          NATASHA

           Let me put you on hold.

          She nods to LUCHKOV. As Luchkov comes to take the phone off her,

          Natasha HITS him with her leg and HEADBUUTS him. Like a spider,

          she stands up elegantly and starts ATTACKING TALL THUG by

          KICKBOXING him in the face.

          Still tied, she ROLLS over WEASELLY THUG after she trips him.

          She then STOMPS on TALL THUG foot with peg of the chair, then

          KNOCKS HIM OUT WITH HER HEAD.

          Yeah, during all this Coulson is still waiting on the line. She

          then FLIPS over and FALLS down hard on WEASELLY THUG, BREAKING

          THE CHAIR. She sees TALL THUG stand.

          Giving her momentum, she runs at him DROP KICKING him, FALLS

          DOWN and FLIPS right back up and WRAPS HER LEGS AROUND HIS NECK

          AND KNOCKS HIM OUT COLD.

          She grabs LUCHKOV, wraps his leg around with a hanging chain and

          drops him down the open floor, dangling. She picks up the phone

          and her heels, like a boss.

                          NATASHA

           Where's Barton now?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           We don't know.

                          NATASHA

           But he's alive.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           We think so. I'll brief you on

           everything when you get back. But

           first, we need you to talk to the big

           guy.

                          NATASHA

           Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me

           about as far as he can throw me.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           No, I've got Stark. You get the big

           guy.

                          NATASHA

           Bozhe moi.

          EXT. INDIAN SLUM  NIGHT

          A LITTLE GIRL runs through the crowd, trying to force a way

          through.

          INT. SHACK  NIGHT

          A tiny shack. The LITTLE GIRL runs up the steps, only to be

          stopped by an attending woman. Then, the LITTLE GIRL spots him.

          BRUCE BANNER, their LOCAL doctor.

                          ATTENDING WOMAN

           What are doing here?! Get out! You

           shouldn't be here!

                          LITTLE GIRL

           I have to see the doctor! It's my

           father!

                          BANNER

           Calm down. What's wrong?

                          LITTLE GIRL

           My father...

          Banner looks behind him seeing how the girl is staring at a few

          people, lying down, looking very sick.

                          BANNER

           Is he like them?

          The LITTLE GIRL holds out all the money she has in the world.

                          LITTLE GIRL

           Please.

          EXT. SLUMS  CONTINUOUS

          Banner and the LITTLE GIRL hastily run nearly to the edge of

          town. The LITTLE GIRL gets ahead of herself. Banner spots local

          government car, he turns around, blocking any view of him.

          EXT/INT. LITTLE GIRL'S SHACK  NIGHT

          Banner quickly follows the LITTLE GIRL inside her house. As he

          walks in, the LITTLE GIRL ESCAPES THROUGH THE WINDOW. Banner is

          left standing there like a dumbass.

                          BANNER

           Should have got paid up front, Banner.

          Natasha then appears from behind the curtains. Banner turns

          around, quietly.

                          NATASHA

           You know, for a man who's supposed to

           be avoiding stress, you picked a hell

           of a place to settle.

                          BANNER

           Avoiding stress isn't the secret.

                          NATASHA

           Then, what is it? Yoga?

                          BANNER

           You brought me to the edge of the city,

           smart. I uh... assume the whole place

           is surrounded?

                          NATASHA

           Just you and me.

                          BANNER

           And your actress buddy, is she a spy

           too? Do they start that young?

                          NATASHA

           I did.

                          BANNER

           Who are you?

                          NATASHA

           Natasha Romanoff.

                          BANNER

           Are you here to kill me, Miss Romanoff?

           Because that's not gonna work out for

           everyone.

                          NATASHA

           No. No. Of course not. I'm here on

           behalf of SHIELD.

                          BANNER

           SHIELD. How did they find me?

                          NATASHA

           We never lost you, doctor. We've kept

           our distance, even helped keep some

           other interested parties off your

           scent.

                          BANNER

           Why?

                          NATASHA

           Nick Fury seems to trust you. But now I

           need you to come in.

                          BANNER

           What if I said no?

                          NATASHA

           I'll persuade you.

                          BANNER

           And what if the... other guy says no?

                          NATASHA

           You've been more than a year without an

           incident. I don't think you wanna break

           that streak.

                          BANNER

           I don't always get what I want.

                          NATASHA

           Doctor, we're facing a potential global

           catastrophe.

                          BANNER

           Well, those I actively try to avoid.

                          NATASHA

           This is the Tesseract. It has the

           potential energy to wipe out the

           planet.

          She shows him a photo of the Tesseract on her cell phone. Banner

          takes a closer look.

                          BANNER

           What does Fury want me to do? Swallow

           it?

                          NATASHA

           Well, he wants you to find it. It's

           been taken. It emits a gamma signature

           that's too weak for us to trace.

           There's no one that knows gamma

           radiation like you do. If there was,

           that's where I'd be.

                          BANNER

           So Fury isn't after the monster?

                          NATASHA

           Not that he's told me.

                          BANNER

           And he tells you everything?

                          NATASHA

           Talk to Fury, he needs you on this.

                          BANNER

           He needs me in a cage?

                          NATASHA

           No one's gonna put you in a...

                          BANNER

           STOP LYING TO ME!

          The THUNDEROUS TONE in is voice makes Natasha QUICKLY grab her

          gun and point it at him, but something is now OFF in the

          atmosphere. Banner stands straight up, smiling.

                          BANNER

           I'm sorry, that was mean. I just wanted

           to see what you'd do. Why don't we do

           this the easy way, where you don't use

           that, and the other guy doesn't make a

           mess? Okay? Natasha...

          Natasha, still wary, doesn't lower her gun. She lowers her gun

          and speaks into her earpiece.

                          NATASHA

           Stand down. We're good here.

          EXT. OUTSIDE THE LITTLE GIRL'S SHACK  NIGHT

          Amazingly, DOZENS OF SHIELD AGENTS are surrounding the shack

          outside.

          INT. LITTLE GIRL'S SHACK  NIGHT

          Banner looks at Natasha, charming a smile at her.

                          BANNER

           Just you and me?

          Natasha fidgets now that she exposed her guard down.

          INT. SHIELD ANALYTICAL ROOM  NIGHT

          Fury is facing several LARGE MONITORS as he as a conference with

          members of the WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1

           This is out of line, Director. You're

           dealing with forces you can't control.

                          NICK FURY

           You ever been in a war, Councilman? In

           a firefight? Did you feel an

           overabundance of control?

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1

           You saying that this Asgard has

           declared war on our planet?

                          NICK FURY

           Not Asgard. Loki.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2

           He can't be working alone. What about

           the other one? His brother.

                          NICK FURY

           Our intelligence says, Thor is not a

           hostile. But he's worlds away, we can't

           depend on him to help. It's up to us.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1

           Which is why you should be focusing on

           phase 2, it was designed for exactly...

                          NICK FURY

           PHASE 2 isn't ready, our enemy is. We

           need a response team.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1

           The Avengers Initiative was shut down.

                          NICK FURY

           This isn't about The Avengers.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1

           We're running the world's greatest

           covert security network and you're

           gonna leave the fate of human race to a

           handful of freaks.

                          NICK FURY

           I'm not leaving anything to anyone. We

           need a response team. These people

           maybe isolated, unbalanced even, but I

           believe with the right push they can be

           exactly what we need.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2

           You believe?

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1

           War isn't won by sentiment, Director.

                          NICK FURY

           No, it's won by soldiers.

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM  NIGHT

          Somewhere in an old, almost WWII-esque boxing gym, STEVE ROGERS,

          a man out of time, THE FIRST AVENGER, FUCKIN' CAPTAIN AMERICA is

          PUMMELING a punching bag. With every swing, it's like a memory

          he's trying to fight off and repress.

          EXT. HYDRA BASE  DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Captain America is running through the forest, dodging mortars,

          gunfire and the Tesseract's energy firearms.

           STEVE (V.O.)

           There's not enough time! I gotta put

           her in the water!

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM  NIGHT

          Steve's rage keeps building as he punches the bag. It gets

          harder...

          INT. HORTEN H.XVIII, RED SKULL'S SHIP  DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Steve places his COMPASS with an image of PEGGY CARTER. The time

          is here for him to crash the plane.

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM  NIGHT

          Steve closes his eyes. Goes at the bag harder.

           PEGGY (V.O.)

           You won't be alone.

          INT. HORTEN H.XVIII, RED SKULL'S SHIP  DAY (FLASHBACK)

          The RED SKULL picks up the TESSERACT.

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM  NIGHT

          Steve opens his eyes and fuckin' tears the bag as the last

          memory kicks in. I don't think he can physically stop...

           SHIELD SCIENTIST (V.O.)

           Oh my god!

          INT. PROJECT P.E.G.A.S.U.S, ANTARCTICA  DAY (FLASHBACK)

          A half frozen Steve Roger is lying down on a medical slab. Two

          SHIELD SCIENTISTS run over hi-tech devices to see if his vitals

          are up. And it seems...

                          SHIELD SCIENTIST

           This guy is still alive!

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM  NIGHT

          Steve FUCKING tears the bag open, off its chain, spilling out

          the sand. He stands, breathing hard, letting out 70 years of

          over repressed feeling.

          After taking a few breathers, Steve picks up another punching

          bag, which is laying next another DOZEN BAGS. He hooks the bag

          up and starts punching again. Fury walks in.

                          NICK FURY

           Trouble sleeping?

                          STEVE

           I slept for seventy years, sir. I think

           I've had my fill.

                          NICK FURY

           Then you should be out, celebrating,

           seeing the world.

          Steve stops punching and walks over to the bench, unraveling the

          tape off his hands. He sits down.

                          STEVE

           I went under, the world was at war, I

           wake up, they say we won. They didn't

           say what we lost.

                          NICK FURY

           We've made some mistakes along the way.

           Some very recently.

                          STEVE

           You here with a mission, sir?

                          NICK FURY

           I am.

                          STEVE

           Trying to get me back in the world?

                          NICK FURY

           Trying to save it.

          Fury hands Steve a file on the Tesseract, along with other files

          on HYDRA'S projects.

                          STEVE

           Hydra's secret weapon.

                          NICK FURY

           Howard Stark fished that out of the

           ocean when he was looking for you. He

           thought what we think, the Tesseract

           could be the key to unlimited

           sustainable energy. That's something

           the world sorely needs.

                          STEVE

           Who took it from you?

                          NICK FURY

           He's called Loki. He's not from around

           here. There's a lot we'll have to bring

           you up to speed on if you're in. The

           world has gotten even stranger than you

           already know.

                          STEVE

           At this point, I doubt anything would

           surprise me.

                          NICK FURY

           Ten bucks says you're wrong. There's a

           debriefing package waiting for you back

           at your apartment.

          Steve turns and picks up a punching bag. Starts walking out of

          the gym.

                          NICK FURY

           Is there anything you can tell us about

           the Tesseract that we ought to know

           now?

                          STEVE

           You should have left it in the ocean.

          INT. OCEAN  NIGHT

          Out in the Atlantic Ocean, TONY STARK, in his IRON MAN suit, is

          cutting a PIPELINE TRANSPORT with a laser cutter coming from his

          hand. He then places a STARK ENERGY REACTOR. It lights up. IRON

          MAN rockets out of the water and flies towards STARK TOWER.

                          TONY

           You're good on this end. The rest is up

           to you.

                          PEPPER POTTS

           (on the other line)

           You disconnected the transition lines?

           Are we off the grid?

          INSIDE THE SUIT -- PEPPER APPEARS ON HIS HUD MONITOR.

                          TONY

           Stark Tower is about to become a beacon

           of self-sustaining clean energy.

                          PEPPER

           Wow. So maybe our reactor takes over

           and it actually works?

                          TONY

           I assume. Light her up.

          As IRON MAN flies to the STARK TOWER BUILDING, the power is

          switched on and the STARK sign LIGHTS UP.

                          PEPPER

           How does it look?

                          TONY

           Like Christmas, but with more... me.

                          PEPPER

           Gotta go wider on the public awareness

           campaign. You need to do some press. I

           can do some more tomorrow. I'm working

           on the zoning for the next billboards.

                          TONY

           Pepper, you're killing me. Remember?

           Enjoy the moment.

                          PEPPER

           Then get in here and I will.

          TONY arrives at his skyscraper penthouse and is in the process

          of taking off his IRON MAN suit through a hi-tech gauntlet of

          gadgets.

                          JARVIS

           Sir, Agent Coulson of SHIELD is on the

           line.

                          TONY

           I'm not in. I'm actually out.

                          JARVIS

           Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.

                          TONY

           Close the line Jarvis. I got a date.

          INT. TONY'S PENTHOUSE  NIGHT

          PEPPER POTTS stares up at the monitors of the reactor device.

                          PEPPER

           Levels are holding steady... I think.

                          TONY

           Of course they are, I was directly

           involved. Which brings me to my next

           question: how does it feel to be a

           genius?

                          PEPPER

           Well, ha, I really wouldn't know now,

           would I?

                          TONY

           What do you mean? All this came from

           you.

                          PEPPER

           No. All this came from that.

          Points to the energy in his chest plate.

                          TONY

           Give yourself some credit, please.

           Stark Tower is your baby. Give

           yourself... twelve percent of the

           credit.

                          PEPPER

           Twelve percent?

                          TONY

           An argument can be made for fifteen.

                          PEPPER

           Twelve percent? For my baby?

                          TONY

           Well, I did do all the heavy lifting.

           Literally, I lifted the heavy things.

           And sorry, but the security snafu? That

           was on you.

                          PEPPER

           Oooooh.

                          TONY

           My private elevator...

                          PEPPER

           You mean OUR elevator?

                          TONY

           ...was teeming with sweaty workmen. I'm

           going to pay for that comment about

           percentages in some subtle way later,

           aren't I?

          Pepper pours herself and Tony a glass of champagne.

                          PEPPER

           Not gonna be that subtle.

                          TONY

           I'll tell you what. Next building's

           gonna say 'Potts' on the tower.

                          PEPPER

           On the lease.

                          TONY

           ...Call your mom, can you bunk over?

                          JARVIS

           Sir, the telephone. I'm afraid my

           protocols are being overwritten.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           Stark, we need to talk. Tony picks up

           his phone and looks into it at Coulson.

                          TONY

           You have reached the life model decoy

           of Tony Stark, please leave a message.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           This is urgent.

                          TONY

           Then leave it urgently.

          At that moment the elevator door opens and Coulson appears.

                          TONY

           Security breach.

                          (TO PEPPER)

           That's on you.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           Mr. Stark.

                          PEPPER

           Phil! Come in.

                          TONY

           Phil? Uh, his first name is Agent.

                          PEPPER

           Come on in, we're celebrating.

                          TONY

           Which is why he can't stay.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           We need you to look this over.

           (he holds out a file towards

                          STARK)

           Soon as possible.

                          TONY

           I don't like being handed things.

                          PEPPER

           That's alright, `cause I love to be

           handed things. So, let's trade.

          She passes her glass of champagne to Coulson and takes the file

          from him, then takes her champagne glass back from Coulson and

          passes the file over to Stark.

                          PEPPER

           Thank you.

                          TONY

           Official consulting hours are between

           eight and five every other Thursday.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           This isn't a consultation.

                          PEPPER

           Is this about The Avengers? Which I...I

           know nothing about.

                          TONY

           The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I

           thought. And I didn't even qualify.

                          PEPPER

           I didn't know that either.

                          TONY

           Yeah, apparently I'm volatile, self-

           obsessed, don't play well with others.

                          PEPPER

           That I did know.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           This isn't about personality profiles

           anymore.

                          TONY

           Whatever. Miss Potts, got a minute?

          Pepper walks over to Tony who places the files into his own

          databases.

                          TONY

           You know, I thought we were having a

           moment.

                          PEPPER

           I was having twelve percent of a

           moment. This seems serious, Phil's

           pretty shaken.

                          TONY

           How did you notice? Why is he Phil?

                          PEPPER

           What is all of this?

                          TONY

           This is, uh...

          Tony EXPANDS his arms and different profiles appear in

          holographic form floating in the air in front of Tony and

          Pepper.

                          TONY

           This.

          Screens appear of CAPTAIN AMERICA IN ACTION, the HULK ROARING AS

          HE ATTACKS THE ARMY AT CULVER UNIVERSITY, THOR FIGHTING THE

          DESTROYER and another is of Loki and the Tesseract, to which

          Stark and Pepper look on in awe.

                          PEPPER

           I'm going to take the jet to D.C.

           tonight.

                          TONY

           Tomorrow.

                          PEPPER

           You've got homework. You've got a lot

           of homework.

                          TONY

           Well, what if I didn't?

                          PEPPER

           If you didn't?

                          TONY

           Yeah.

                          PEPPER

           You mean if you finished?

           (Stark nods his head)

           Well, um...then...

          She whispers something in his ear. Tony GASPS. Coulson looks

          away in embarrassment.

                          TONY

           Square deal. It's the last date.

          Pepper kisses him.

                          PEPPER

           Work hard.

          As Pepper leaves with Agent Coulson, Tony grabs the Tesseract in

          holograph form, worried.

          INT. QUINJET  DAY

          Inside the QUINJET, Steve is sitting down, holding a TABLET,

          watching the footage of the Hulk's attack on the Army at Culver

          University.

                          PILOT

           We're about forty minutes out from

           base, sir.

          Agent Coulson stands up from his seat and walks over to Steve.

                          STEVE

           So, this Doctor Banner was trying to

           replicate the serum that was used on

           me?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           A lot of people were. You were the

           world's first superhero. Banner thought

           gamma radiation might hold the key to

           unlocking Erskine's original formula.

          The Hulk roars with fury as he slams a jeep apart.

                          STEVE

           Didn't really go his way, did it?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           Not so much. When he's not that thing

           though, guy's like a Stephen Hawking.

          Steve looks confused.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           He's like a smart person. I gotta say,

           it's an honor to meet you, officially.

          Steve smiles at Coulson.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           I sort of met you, I mean, I watched

           you while you were sleeping.

          Steve looks down. He stands up, closes his laptop and walks to

          the side with Coulson following.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           I mean, I was... I was present while

           you were unconscious from the ice. You

           know, it's really, it's just a... just

           a huge honor to have you on board.

                          STEVE

           Well, I hope I'm the man for the job.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           Oh, you are. Absolutely. Uh... we've

           made some modifications to the uniform.

           I had a little design input.

                          STEVE

           The uniform? Aren't the stars and

           stripes a little... old fashioned?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           With everything that's happening, the

           things that are about to come to light,

           people might just need a little old

           fashioned.

          Steve takes in Coulson's sentiment.

          INT. UNDERGROUND LAB  DAY

          Several soldiers under Loki's mind control run around, preparing

          to infiltrate whatever Loki has planned. Loki sits down,

          watching Selvig work with a CMS device. Loki meditates, until...

          EXT. THRONE ROOM  NIGHT

          ...the scepter materializes him back into the throne room of THE

          OTHER, fully armed in his horned helmet and armor. THE OTHER

          appears from the steps.

                          THE OTHER

           The Chitauri grow restless.

                          LOKI

           Let them go at themselves. I will lead

           them into glorious battle.

                          THE OTHER

           Battle? Against the meager might of

           Earth?

                          LOKI

           Glorious, not lengthy. If your force is

           as formidable as you claim.

                          THE OTHER

           You question us? You question HIM? He,

           who put the scepter in your hand, who

           gave you ancient knowledge and new

           purpose when you were cast out,

           defeated?

                          LOKI

           I was a king! The rightful king of

           Asgard! Betrayed!

                          THE OTHER

           Your ambition is little, born of

           childish need. We look beyond the Earth

           to greater worlds the Tesseract will

           unveil.

                          LOKI

           You don't have the Tesseract yet.

          THE OTHER runs over to attack him, but stops as Loki points his

          scepter.

                          LOKI

           I don't threaten, but until I open the

           doors, until your force is mine to

           command, you are but words.

                          THE OTHER

           You will have your war, Asgardian. If

           you fail, if the Tesseract is kept from

           us, there will be no realm, no barren

           moon, no crevice where he can't find

           you. You think you know pain? He will

           make you long for something as sweet as

           pain.

          THE OTHER places his hand on Loki's head and transports him back

          to Earth. Loki looks around, menacing.

          EXT. HELICARRIER LANDING STRIP  DAY

          The QUINJET lands down a MASSIVE BATTLESHIP known as the

          HELICARRIER. It has two runways. One with direct access to a

          hangar at the rear is aligned along the spine of the vessel.

          Agent Coulson and Steve walk down the ramp, meeting up with

          Natasha.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           Agent Romanoff. Captain Rogers.

                          STEVE

           Ma'am?

                          NATASHA

           Hi.

                          (TO COULSON)

           They need you on the bridge. Face time.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           See you there.

          Agent Coulson walks away leaving Steve with Natasha, walking

          towards the railing of the ship.

                          NATASHA

           There was quite the buzz around here,

           finding you in the ice. I thought

           Coulson was gonna swoon. Did he ask you

           to sign his Captain America trading

           cards yet?

                          STEVE

           Trading cards?

                          NATASHA

           They're vintage, he's very proud.

          Without realizing, Banner doesn't notice them walking as he

          isnervous as hell. He moves around as people keep walking in

          hisway.

                          STEVE

           Dr. Banner.

          Steve walks up to Banner and shakes his hands.

                          BANNER

           Oh, yeah. Hi. They told me you'd be

           coming.

                          STEVE

           Word is you can find the cube.

                          BANNER

           Is that the only word on me?

                          STEVE

           Only word I care about.

                          BANNER

           (takes in the sentiment)

           Must be strange for you, all of this.

                          STEVE

           Well, this is actually kind of

           familiar.

                          NATASHA

           Gentlemen, you may wanna step inside in

           a minute. It's gonna get a little hard

           to breath.

          Suddenly the HELICARRIER starts SHAKING as it prepares to fly

          "sail."

                          STEVE

           Is this is a submarine?

                          BANNER

           Really? They wanted me in a submerged

           pressurized metal container?

          They both move closer to the edge of the HELICARRIER. FOUR HUGE

          LIFT FANS MOUNTED ON THE SIDES STARTS TO LIFT INTO THE AIR IN

          VTOL FLIGHT. Steve watches in AWE as Banner smiles.

                          BANNER

           OH, NO. THIS IS MUCH WORSE.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

          The doors part and we enter THE BRIDGE OF THE SHIP  a flurry of

          activity  dozens of agents sit in front of their VIEWSCREENS.

          Agent Hill shouts her instructs to leave. Turns to NICK FURY,

          who is at the command chair.

           AGENT MARIA HILL

           We're at lock, sir.

                          NICK FURY

           Good. Let's vanish.

          EXT. SKY

          The HELICARRIER rises high into the heavens. Suddenly, the

          entire ship is covered in reflecting mirrors, which then

          camouflages in the sky.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  CONTINUOUS

          Steve and Banner walk through the glorious, gleaming bridge,

          taking his position at the SCIENCE CONSOLE.

                          NICK FURY

           Gentlemen.

          Steve gives Fury 10 bucks, referring to his earlier statement

          about never being surprised again. Fury walks over Banner and

          extends his hand. Banner, reluctantly shakes it.

                          NICK FURY

           Doctor, thank you for coming.

                          BANNER

           Thanks for asking nicely. So, uh... how

           long am I staying?

                          NICK FURY

           Once we get our hands on the Tesseract,

           you're in the clear.

                          BANNER

           Where are you with that?

          Nick Fury turns to Agent Coulson to explain, while Natasha

          Romanoff eyes an image of Clint Barton on a computer screen.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           We're sweeping every wirelessly

           accessible camera on the planet.

           Cellphones, laptops. If it's connected

           to a satellite, it's eyes and ears for

           us.

                          NATASHA

           That's still not gonna find them in

           time.

                          BANNER

           You have to narrow the field. How many

           spectrometers do you have access to?

                          NICK FURY

           How many are there?

                          BANNER

           Call every lab you know, tell them to

           put the spectrometers on the roof and

           calibrate them for gamma rays. I'll

           rough out a tracking algorithm based on

           cluster recognition. At least we could

           rule out a few places. Do you have

           somewhere for me to work?

                          NICK FURY

           Agent Romanoff, would you show

           Dr.Banner to his laboratory, please.

          Natasha nods and walks off, leading Banner down the hall.

                          NATASHA

           You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all

           the toys.

          INT. UNDERGROUND LAB, VACUUM ROOM  DAY

          Selvig and several scientists work around the CMS device.

          Bartonwalks in, holding a tablet.

                          SELVIG

           Put it over there!

                          (TO BARTON)

           Where did you find all these people?

                          CLINT BARTON

           SHIELD has not shortage of enemies,

           Doctor.

          He holds up a screen showing information on IRIDIUM.

                          CLINT BARTON

           Is this the stuff you need?

                          SELVIG

           Yeah, iridium. It's found in

           meteorites, it forms anti-protons. It's

           very hard to get hold of.

                          CLINT BARTON

           Especially if SHIELD knows you need it.

                          SELVIG

           Well, I didn't know!

           (sees Loki coming)

           Hey! The Tesseract is showing me so

           much. It's more than just knowledge,

           it's... truth.

                          LOKI

           I know. What did it show you, Agent

           Barton?

                          CLINT BARTON

           My next target.

                          LOKI

           Tell me what you need.

                          CLINT BARTON

           I'll need a distraction.

           (grabs his bow)

           And an eyeball.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  NIGHT

          As they are waiting to locate Loki using satellite facial

          recognition, Coulson and Steve stand side by side, waiting.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           I mean, if it's not too much trouble.

                          STEVE

           No, no. It's fine.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           It's a vintage set. It took me a couple

           of years to collect them all. Near

           mint, slight foxing around the edges,

           but...

           AGENT JASPER SITWELL

           We got a hit. Sixty-seven percent

           match. Weight, cross match, seventy-

           nine percent.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           Location?

           AGENT JASPER SITWELL

           Stuttgart, Germany. 28, Konigstrasse.

           He's not exactly hiding.

                          NICK FURY

           Captain, you're up.

          Steve nods. Leaves.

          EXT. STUTTGART MUSEUM  NIGHT

          Loki standing in front of the museum, dressed in 21st century

          attire and with the scepter, disguised as a cane, walks up to

          the entrance of the gala.

          INT. STUTTGART GALA  NIGHT

          Inside, a lavished gala with an orchestra playing, is

          interrupted as the HEAD DOCTOR walks up to the mic.

          INT. HELICARRIER, STEVE'S LOCKER  NIGHT

          Steve walks into his own locker room. As he approaches to the

          steel cabinet, the doors already reveal the updated CAPTAIN

          AMERICA UNIFORM, along with the famous SHIELD. He stands in

          silence.

          EXT. STUTTGART MUSEUM  NIGHT

          Outside the museum, GERMAN GUARDS stand in their positions. One

          of them is standing on top of the roof, scoping. He then hears a

          THWACK!

          He looks down. One of his guards is shot with an ARROW. He

          raises his gun. He is shot dead by an arrow. Falls down. Barton

          and his CREW arrive at the doors of the locked science building.

          Barton looks at the retinal scanner. He pulls out a SHIELD eye

          scanner instrument.

          INT. STUTTGART GALA  NIGHT

          Loki looks from above the museum and descends down to where the

          HEAD DOCTOR is. As he makes it down and near the stage, he FLIPS

          his cane the other end. The guard there notices him, pulls out

          his gun, but Loki CLUBS his head in. CHAOS ERUPTS.

          Guests begin to leave the museum. Loki grabs the doctor and

          flips him over onto a marble table of the mythological creatures

          BILCHSTEIM. Loki pulls out an OPTICAL TORTURE DEVICE. He PLUNGES

          down the doctor's eye. The doctor TWISTS in pain.

          EXT. STUTTGART MUSEUM  NIGHT

          Suddenly, from Barton's instrument, a holographic eye of the

          head doctor appears and the image of the doctor appears on

          screen.

          The doors to the facility open. Barton walks in and finds in a

          cabinet, a glass thermos with a cylinder of iridium.

          EXT. STUTTGART GALA  NIGHT

          As the crowd runs away, Loki slowly walks out and materializes

          in his gold armor and helmet. The POLICE arrive and with no

          hesitation, he BLASTS the cars, FLIPPING them over and over.

                          LOKI

           Kneel before me.

          The crowd ignores him. Another LOKI appears, blocking the crowd.

          Loki after Loki appears, they all grin as they raise their

          spears, encircling the crowd.

                          LOKI

           I said. KNEEL!!!

          Everyone becomes quiet and kneels in front him. Loki embracing

          his arms out, smiling.

                          LOKI

           Is not this simpler? Is this not your

           natural state? It's the unspoken truth

           of humanity, that you crave

           subjugation. The bright lure of freedom

           diminishes your life's joy in a mad

           scramble for power, for identity. You

           were made to be ruled. In the end, you

           will always kneel.

          As the words resonate to the kneeling crowd, an ELDER GERMAN MAN

          refuses to kneel and stands, heroic.

           ELDER GERMAN MAN

           Not to men like you.

                          LOKI

           There are no men like me.

           ELDER GERMAN MAN

           There are always men like you.

                          LOKI

           Look to your elder, people. Let him be

           an example.

          Loki is about to execute him with his scepter as the light GLOWS

          blue. Just as the ENERGY BEAM shoots out, FUCKING CAPTAIN

          AMERICA arrives! He dives in just in time and BLOCKS the blast

          with his SHIELD, knocking down Loki on his ass.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           You know, the last time I was in

           Germany and saw a man standing above

           everybody else, we ended up

           disagreeing.

                          LOKI

                          (STANDING UP)

           The soldier. A man out of time.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           I'm not the one who's out of time.

          From above Cap, the QUINJET arrives. A machine gun is pointed

          towards Loki.

                          NATASHA

           Loki, drop the weapon and stand down.

          Like greased lighting, Loki sends a BLAST of blue at the

          QUINJET. Natasha MANEUVERS it just in time, giving Cap the time

          to throw his shield at Loki. They both begin to DUKE IT OUT.

          Loki FLINGS Cap to the ground. Cap then throws his shield, but

          Loki SWATS it way. Cap, using all the moves of a boxer, is

          KNOCKED down by Loki. Standing over him, he points the scepter's

          tip on his helmet.

                          LOKI

           Kneel.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           Not today!

          Cap FLIPS and KNOCKS him out with his leg. Loki grabs him and

          FLIPS him over.

          INT. QUINJET  NIGHT

                          NATASHA

           The guy's all over the place.

          Suddenly, AC/DC's "Shoot to Thrill" overdrives the QUINJET'S

          speakers.

                          IRON MAN

           Agent Romanoff, did you miss me?

          Both Cap and Loki look up at the sky. Tony flies over in his

          IRON MAN suit and blasts Loki right back to the ground. IRON MAN

          touches down. He stands up and pulls out every piece of weaponry

          the suit has.

                          IRON MAN

           Make your move, Reindeer Games.

          Loki puts up his hands and surrenders. His armor materializes

          away.

                          IRON MAN

           Good move.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           Mr. Stark.

                          IRON MAN

           Captain.

          INT. QUINJET  NIGHT

          Natasha watches the skies. THUNDER. Coming out of nowhere. Fury

          speaks over her headset.

           NICK FURY (V.O.)

           Said anything?

                          NATASHA

           Not a word.

           NICK FURY (V.O.)

           Just get him here. We're low on time.

          With Loki tied up and cuffed to his seat, Tony and Steve watch

          from a distance, whispering.

                          STEVE

           I don't like it.

                          TONY

           What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?

                          STEVE

           I don't remember it being ever that

           easy. This guy packs a wallop.

                          TONY

           Still, you are pretty spry, for an

           older fellow. What's your thing?

           Pilates?

                          STEVE

           What?

                          TONY

           It's like calisthenics. You might have

           missed a couple things, you know, doing

           time as a Capsicle.

          Steve looks at Tony, finally meeting his ego match.

                          STEVE

           Fury didn't tell me he was calling you

           in.

                          TONY

           Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury

           doesn't tell you.

          THUNDER and LIGHTNING nearly hit the jet, making it shake

          violently.

                          NATASHA

           Where's this coming from?

          Thunder RUMBLES overhead. Loki stares out the window intently.

                          STEVE

           What's the matter? Scared of a little

           lightning?

                          LOKI

           I'm not overly fond of what follows.

          What the fuck? OUTSIDE THE JET A BLINDING LIGHT hits the jet.

          Not a light. A King.

          THE MIGHTY THOR. Thor OPENS the ramp and grabs Loki by the

          throat and flies out. Steve and Tony are left dumbstruck. Tony

          puts the IRON MAN helmet on.

                          IRON MAN

           Now there's that guy.

                          NATASHA

           Another Asgardian?

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           Think the guy's a friendly?

                          IRON MAN

           Doesn't matter. If he frees Loki or

           kills him, the Tesseract's lost.

          Tony turns and gets ready to jump off the jet to chase after

          Thor.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           Stark, we need a plan of attack!

                          IRON MAN

           I have a plan. Attack.

          IRON MAN jumps out of the jet and chases after Thor. Cap grabs a

          parachute to follow.

                          NATASHA

           I'd sit this one out, Cap.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           I don't see how I can.

                          NATASHA

           These guys come from legends, they're

           basically gods.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           There's only one God, ma'am. And I'm

           pretty sure he doesn't dress like that.

          Cap JUMPS OUT of the jet.

          EXT. MOUNTAIN LEDGE  NIGHT

          Somewhere out in the European mountains, Thor throws Loki into

          the side of the mountain. He raises the mighty hammer, MJOLNIR.

          He looks down at his brother, who he thought to be dead and is

          angry to see him alive in this fashion.

                          THOR

           Where is the Tesseract?

                          LOKI

                          (LAUGHS)

           I missed you too.

                          THOR

           Do I look to be in a gaming mood?!

                          LOKI

           Oh, you should thank me. With the

           Bifrost gone how much dark energy did

           the Allfather have to muster to conjure

           you here? Your precious Earth.

          Thor drops MJOLNIR, causing the mountain to quake. He picks up

          Loki. His brother.

          Although Thor is pissed for what he has done, a family is

          everything to a man or god.

                          THOR

           I thought you dead.

                          LOKI

           Did you mourn?

                          THOR

           We all did. Our father...

                          LOKI

           Your father. He did tell you my true

           parentage, did he not?

          Thor lets go Loki, who walks away from Thor, causing an even

          bigger wedge between them.

                          THOR

           We were raised together, we played

           together, we fought together. Do you

           remember none of that?

                          LOKI

                          (TURNS AROUND)

           I remember a shadow. Living in the

           shade of your greatness. I remember you

           tossing me into an abyss. I was and

           should be king!

                          THOR

           So you take the world I love as

           recompense for your imagined slights.

           No, the Earth is under my protection,

           Loki.

                          LOKI

                          (LAUGHS)

           And you're doing a marvelous job with

           that. The humans slaughter each other

           in droves, while you idly threat. I

           mean to rule them. And why should I

           not?

                          THOR

           You think yourself above them.

                          LOKI

           Well, yes.

                          THOR

           Then you miss the truth of ruling,

           brother. Throne would suit you ill.

          Angrily, Loki shoves his brother to the side. He walks back up

          to the ledge. Turns around.

                          LOKI

           I've seen worlds you've never known

           about! I have grown, Odinson, in my

           exile! I have seen the true power of

           the Tesseract, and when I wield it...

                          THOR

           Who showed you this power? Who controls

           the would-be-king?

                          LOKI

           I am a king!

                          THOR

           Not here! You give up the Tesseract!

           You give up this poisonous dream! You

           come home.

                          LOKI

           I don't have it. You need the cube to

           bring me home, but I've sent it off I

           know not where.

          Mjolnir flies back to his grasp.

                          THOR

           You listen well, brother. I...

          THOR IS KNOCKED OFF THE MOUNTAIN BY IRON MAN WHO TACKLES HIM IN

          MID-FLIGHT.

                          LOKI

           I'm listening.

          EXT. FOREST  CONTINUOUS

          THOR and IRON MAN CRASH into the forest. Thor rolls himself up.

          IRON MAN is still standing, but keeps his distance. The helmet

          opens up.

                          THOR

           Do not touch me again!

                          TONY

           Then don't take my stuff.

                          THOR

           You have no idea what you're dealing

           with.

                          TONY

           Shakespeare in the park? Doth mother

           know you weareth her drapes?

                          THOR

           This is beyond you, metal man. Loki

           will face Asgardian justice!

                          TONY

           He gives up the Cube, he's all yours.

           Until then, stay out of my way...

           tourist.

          The IRON MAN helmet clamps up and he walks away. In one quick

          move, Thor pulls Mjolnir, throws it, and KNOCKS IRON MAN clear

          across into a tree.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY

           Okay.

          From the mountain side, Loki watches in amusement. Thor raises

          his hand. Mjolnir flies back to his hand. Thor SWINGS the

          hammer, summoning a ray of energy.

          IRON MAN stands up and from his HAND BOOSTERS, a BLAST of ENERGY

          KNOCKS the MIGHTY AVENGER on his ass. IRON MAN flies back up and

          knocks Thor into a tree. Right back at you, bitch!

          Thor, kneeling on the ground, pulls Mjolnir to his hand, raises

          it to the skies and pulls in LIGHTING and THUNDER! Thor points

          the hammer at IRON MAN and the outpouring of bolts lighting

          increases in intensity. IRON MAN falls back.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          JARVIS

           Power at 400% capacity.

                          TONY

           How about that?

          IRON MAN FIRES AWAY FROM HIS HAND BOOSTERS, pushing Thor to his

          knees. Like two gunslingers ready to draw, both Thor and IRON

          MAN fly towards each other and meet in the middle and ascend up.

          EXT. SKY  NIGHT

          The two battle. IRON MAN grasps THOR, elbowing him and SMASHING

          him into the side of a mountain.

          THOR LEAPS off the mountain and takes IRON MAN with him.

          EXT. FOREST  CONTINUOUS

          THOR and IRON MAN crash right back down, smashing down every

          tree possible. IRON MAN YANKS Thor right up. Thor grabs both

          HANDS BOOSTERS and begins to CRUSH them. Tony quickly CHARGES as

          much energy as he can and SHOOTS ENERGY in Thor's face.

          Thor FALLS back, losing his stance. IRON MAN HEADBUTTS Thor,

          with his gold-titanium alloy helmet. Thor... HEADBUTTS him with

          his fuckin' head and actually sends IRON MAN across the forest.

          IRON MAN boosters up and flies back at Thor, grabbing him by the

          arm and cape and SWINGS him into another tree. Thor looks up,

          ready. Thor runs with all his patience out the window. IRON MAN

          SWINGS and MISSES, giving Thor the momentum to grab him, lift

          him and SMASH him down hard.

          Thor summons back Mjolnir to his hand. Just as he's about to put

          the hammer down, IRON MAN uses his HAND BOOSTERS to SKID across

          the ground and trip Thor over. Standing up, Thor looks for him,

          but from behind him, IRON MAN CRASHES into his back. Thor stands

          facing IRON MAN. Ready to pounce...

          CAPTAIN AMERICA'S shield RICOCHETS off both Thor and IRON MAN,

          stopping them. They look up and see CAPTAIN AMERICA standing on

          top of a fallen tree with the shield back in hand.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           Hey! That's enough!

           (comes down; looks at Thor)

           Now, I don't know what you plan on

           doing here.

                          THOR

           I've come here to put an end to Loki's

           schemes!

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           Then prove it! Put the hammer down.

                          IRON MAN

           Um, yeah, no! Bad call! He loves his

           hammer!

          THOR BACKHANDS IRON MAN LIKE A PIMP WITH MJOLNIR.

          Thor, losing all tolerance with this SENTENTIAL OF LIBERTY,

          raises the hammer.

                          THOR

                          (TO CAP)

           You want me to put the hammer down?

          THOR LEAPS HIGH INTO THE AIR, RAISING THAT FUCKING HAMMER.

          CAPTAIN AMERICA CROUCHES DOWN and HOLDS UP HIS SHIELD. THOR

          brings that hammer down onto the shield and a MASSIVE IMPLOSION

          OF LIGHT reacts to the vibranium shield creating a MASSIVE

          SHOCKWAVE THAT BLOWS UP ANYTHING STANDING WITHIN A MILE.

          IRON MAN stands up, looking around like `holy shit.' Lying right

          next to him is Cap, who never takes his eye off Thor. Thor looks

          at both men.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           Are we done here?

          THOR, CAPTAIN AMERICA AND IRON MAN STAND THERE.

          INT. HELICARRIER HALLWAY  NIGHT

          DOZENS of SHIELD POLICE escort Loki, who is in handcuffs,

          smiling. As they pass the HELICARRIER LAB, Banner stops working

          on the CHITAURI SCEPTER and looks up. Loki eyes him as he walks,

          nodding and smiling. BANNER rubs his head.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION  NIGHT

          Loki is now free from his cuffs and is contained in a LARGE

          GLASS CELL held by HYDRAULIC RIGS. Fury walks up the control

          panel of the cell.

                          NICK FURY

           In case it's unclear. You try to

           escape. You so much as scratch that

           glass.

          Fury presses a button which OPENS UP a HATCH underneath Loki's

          cell. Loki peers as much as he can from the glass.

          Without seeing, the sounds of GUSTING WIND would make man shit

          his pants. Not a god, though.

                          NICK FURY

           Thirty thousand feet, straight down in

           a steel trap. You get how that works?!

          Fury closes the hatch. Points at Loki.

                          NICK FURY

           Ant.

          Then points at the button which would drop Loki into the steel

          trap.

                          NICK FURY

           Boot.

                          LOKI

                          (SMIRKING)

           It's an impressive cage. Not built, I

           think, for me.

                          NICK FURY

           Built for something a lot stronger than

           you.

                          LOKI

           Oh, I've heard.

          Loki looks into the camera.

          INT. BRIEFING ROOM  CONTINUOUS

          The others watch on the monitor Loki getting interrogated.

          Banner looks at the monitor, intently.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION  CONTINUOUS

                          LOKI

           The mindless beast, makes play he's

           still a man. How desperate are you,

           that you call upon such lost creatures

           to defend you?

                          NICK FURY

           How desperate am I? You threaten my

           world with war. You steal a force you

           can't hope to control.

                          (MORE)

           NICK FURY (CONT'D)

           You talk about peace and you kill

           `cause it's fun. You have made me very

           desperate. You might not be glad that

           you did.

                          LOKI

           Ooh. It burns you to come so close. To

           have the Tesseract, to have power,

           unlimited power. And for what? A warm

           light for all mankind to share, and

           then to be reminded what real power is.

                          NICK FURY

                          (SMILING)

           Well, you let me know if Real Power

           wants a magazine or something.

          Fury walks off leaving Loki in his glass cell. Loki looks back

          at the camera, smirking.

          INT. BRIEFING ROOM  CONTINUOUS

          Steve watches until the monitor goes black. Thor, who didn't

          even look, just listened, stands there, torn apart. They all

          just stand there in stunned SILENCE. Finally --

                          BANNER

           He really grows on you, doesn't he?

                          STEVE

           Loki's gonna drag this out. So, Thor,

           what's his play?

                          THOR

                          (COMING TOO)

           He has an army called the Chitauri.

           They're not of Asgard or any world

           known. He means to lead them against

           your people. They will win him the

           earth. In return, I suspect, for the

           Tesseract.

                          STEVE

                          (SERIOUSLY)

           An army? From outer space?

                          BANNER

          So he's building another portal. That's

          what he needs Erik Selvig for.

                          THOR

          Selvig?

                          BANNER

          He's an astrophysicist.

                          THOR

          He's a friend.

                          NATASHA

          Loki has him under some kind of spell,

          along with one of ours.

                          STEVE

          I wanna know why Loki let us take him.

          He's not leading an army from here.

                          BANNER

          I don't think we should be focusing on

          Loki. That guy's brain is a bag full of

          cats, you could smell crazy on him.

                          THOR

          Have care how you speak. Loki is beyond

          reason, but he is of Asgard, and he's

          my brother.

                          NATASHA

          He killed eighty people in two days.

                          THOR

          He's adopted.

                          BANNER

          Iridium, what did they need the Iridium

          for?

                          TONY

          It's a stabilizing agent.

           (walks in with Coulson; to

                          COULSON)

          I'll fly you there. Keep the love

          alive. Means the portal won't collapse

          on itself, like it did at SHIELD.

                          TONY (CONT'D)

                          (TO THOR)

           No hard feelings, Point Break. You've

           got a mean swing.

           (referring to the Iridium)

           Also, it means the portal can open as

           wide, and stay open as long, as Loki

           wants.

                          (TO CREW)

           Uh, raise the mid-mast, ship the top

           sails. That man is playing GALAGA!

           Thought we wouldn't notice. But we did.

           (covering his eye, looks

                          AROUND)

           How does Fury do this?

           AGENT MARIA HILL

           He turns.

          Tony looks around the monitors and places a BUTTON SIZE HACKING

          IMPLANT under Fury's desk, without anyone noticing.

                          TONY

           Well, that sounds exhausting. The rest

           of the raw materials, Agent Barton can

           get his hands on pretty easily. Only

           major component he still needs is a

           power source. A high energy density,

           something to kick start the cube.

           AGENT MARIA HILL

           When did you become an expert in

           thermonuclear astrophysics?

                          TONY

           Last night. The packet, Selvig's notes,

           the Extraction Theory papers. Am I the

           only one who did the reading?

                          STEVE

           Does Loki need any particular kind of

           power source?

                          BANNER

           He's got to heat the cube to a

           hundredand twenty million Kelvin just

           to break through the Coulomb barrier.

                          TONY

           Unless, Selvig has figured out how to

           stabilize the quantum tunneling effect.

                          BANNER

           Well, if he could do that he could

           achieve Heavy Ion Fusion at any reactor

           on the planet.

                          TONY

           Finally, someone who speaks English.

                          STEVE

           Is that what just happened?

          Tony and Banner shake hands. A glimmer in their eyes shines as

          the mutual respect for each other shows.

                          TONY

           It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner.

           You're work on anti-electron collisions

           is unparalleled. And I'm a huge fan of

           the way you lose control and turn into

           an enormous green rage monster.

                          BANNER

                          (LOOKS DOWN)

           Thanks.

                          NICK FURY

                          (WALKING IN)

           Dr. Banner is only here to track the

           cube. I was hoping you might join him.

                          STEVE

           Let's start with that stick of his. It

           may be magical, but it works an awful

           lot like a HYDRA weapon.

                          NICK FURY

           I don't know about that, but it is

           powered by the cube. And I'd like to

           know how Loki used it to turn two of

           the sharpest men I know into his

           personal flying monkeys.

                          THOR

           Monkeys? I do not understand.

                          STEVE

           I do! I understood that reference.

          Tony rolls his eyes, while Cap looks proud of himself.

                          TONY

           Shall we play, doctor?

                          BANNER

           Let's play some.

          As Banner and Tony walk out, the GALAGA PLAYER turns ever so

          discreetly, watches as everyone else disperses and goes back to

          playing.

          INT. BANNER'S LAB - NIGHT (LATER)

          Banner continuously scans with a gamma ray detection scanner on

          the scepter for radiation.

          Tony looks at his monitors, shifting and solving as many

          algorithms and equations.

                          BANNER

           The gamma readings are definitely

           consistent with Selvig's reports on the

           Tesseract. But it's gonna take weeks to

           process.

                          TONY

           If we bypass their mainframe and direct

           a reroute to the Homer cluster, we can

           clock this around six hundred

           teraflops.

                          BANNER

           All I packed was a tooth brush.

                          TONY

                          (SMILES)

           You know, you should come by STARK

           TOWERS sometime. Top ten floors, all

           R&D. You'd love it, it's candy land.

                          BANNER

           Thanks, but the last time I was in New

           York I kind of broke...Harlem.

                          TONY

           Well, I promise a stress free

           environment. No tension. No surprises.

          Suddenly, Tony pokes Banner with a MINIATURE ELECTRICAL PROD.

          Steve walks in on them, pissed at Tony.

                          BANNER

           OW!

          Tony looks at Banner closely.

                          TONY

           Nothing?

                          STEVE

                          (TO BANNER)

           Hey! Are you nuts?

                          TONY

           You really have got a lid on it,

           haven't you? What's your secret? Mellow

           jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed?

                          STEVE

           Is everything a joke to you?

                          TONY

           Funny things are.

                          STEVE

           Threatening the safety of everyone on

           this ship isn't funny. No offense,

           doctor.

                          BANNER

           No, it's alright. I wouldn't have come

           aboard if I couldn't handle pointy

           things.

                          TONY

           You're tiptoeing, big man. You need to

           strut.

                          STEVE

           And you need to focus on the problem,

           Mr. Stark.

                          TONY

           You think I'm not? Why did Fury call us

           and why now? Why not before? What isn't

           he telling us? I can't do the equation

           unless I have all the variables.

                          STEVE

           You think Fury's hiding something?

                          TONY

           He's a spy. Captain, he's the spy. His

           secrets have secrets.

           (points to Banner)

           It's bugging him too, isn't it?

                          BANNER

           (bobbling the words)

           Uh...I just wanna finish my work here

           and...

                          STEVE

           Doctor?

          A beat.

                          BANNER

           'A warm light for all mankind, Loki's

           jab at Fury about the cube.

                          STEVE

           I heard it.

                          BANNER

           (pointing at Tony)

           Well, I think that was meant for you.

           Even if Barton didn't post that all

           over the news.

                          STEVE

           The Stark Tower? That big ugly

           (Tony gives him a look)

           ...building in New York?

                          BANNER

          It's powered by Stark Reactors, self-

          sustaining energy source. That building

          will run itself for what, a year?

                          TONY

          That's just the prototype. I'm kind of

          the only name in clean energy right

          now.

                          BANNER

           (referring to Tony)

          So, why didn't SHIELD bring him in on

          the Tesseract project? I mean, what are

          they doing in the energy business in

          the first place?

                          TONY

          I should probably look into that once

          my decryption programmer finishes

          breaking into all of SHIELD's secure

          files.

                          STEVE

           (taken by that)

          I'm sorry, did you say...?

                          TONY

          Jarvis has been running it since I hit

          the bridge. In a few hours we'll know

          every dirty secret SHIELD has ever

          tried to hide.

           (holds out a bag of blueberries)

          Blueberry?

                          STEVE

          Yet you're confused about why they

          didn't want you around?

                          TONY

          An intelligence organization that fears

          intelligence? Historically, not

          possible.

                          STEVE

           I think Loki's trying to wind us up.

           This is a man who means to start a war,

           and if don't stay focused, he'll

           succeed. We have orders, we should

           follow them.

                          TONY

           Following is not really my style.

                          STEVE

                          (SMILING)

           And you're all about style, aren't you?

                          TONY

           (a nerve hit)

           Of the people in this room, which one

           is; A. wearing a spangly outfit, and B.

           not of use?

                          BANNER

           Steve, tell me none of this smells a

           little funky to you?

          Steve takes in the possibility, but as an obedient soldier,

          shakes it off.

                          STEVE

           Just find the cube.

          Steve walks out of the lab. Still torn apart by the possibility,

          he walks away, towards the HULL of the ship.

          BACK IN THE LAB

                          TONY

           That's the guy my dad never shut up

           about? Wondering if they shouldn't have

           kept him on ice.

                          BANNER

           The guy's not wrong about Loki. He does

           have the jump on us.

                          TONY

           What he's got is an ACME dynamite kit.

                          TONY (CONT'D)

           It's gonna blow up in his face, and I'm

           gonna be there when it does.

                          BANNER

           And I'll read all about it.

                          TONY

           Uh-huh. Or you'll be suiting up like

           the rest of us.

                          BANNER

           Ah, see. I don't get a suit of armor.

           I'm exposed, like a nerve. It's a

           nightmare.

                          TONY

           You know, I've got a cluster of

           shrapnel, trying every second to crawl

           its way into my heart.

           (points at the MINI-ARC

           REACTOR in his chest)

           This stops it. This little circle of

           light. It's part of me now, not just

           armor. It's a... terrible privilege.

                          BANNER

           But you can control it.

                          TONY

           Because I learned how.

                          BANNER

           It's different.

          Banner tries to read the computer screen, but Tony slides the

          data aside with his finger so the two can see face-to-face.

                          TONY

           Hey, I've read all about your accident.

           That much gamma exposure should have

           killed you.

                          BANNER

           So you're saying that the Hulk... the

           other guy... saved my life?

                          (MORE)

                          BANNER (CONT'D)

           That's nice. It's a nice sentiment.

           Saved it for what?

                          TONY

                          (A BEAT)

           I guess we'll find out.

          Banner and Stark get back to work at their respective computers.

                          BANNER

           You might not like that.

                          TONY

           You just might.

          INT. HULL HANGAR, SECURE STORAGE 10-C  NIGHT

          Steve, with all his MIGHT, slides the HEAVY IRON door and

          STEALTHILY walks in. SECURE STORAGE 10-C is a large warehouse,

          filled with METAL CRATES stacked.

          Steve looks up, seeing another level. He LEAPS up high and holds

          onto the catwalk railing. Steve continues to move forward.

          INT. VAN  NIGHT

          Inside this particular van, Selvig and a few other SOLDIERS are

          driving inside a long tunnel. With the CMS device inside, Selvig

          carefully picks up the small cylinder shape IRIDIUM with metal

          prongs and lightly places it a SLOT within the CMS. THE CMS

          ACCEPTS IT. Selvig looks at it, devilishly smiling.

          INT. BRIEFING ROOM  NIGHT

          On a SHIELD monitor is a photo and record of JANE FOSTER. Thor

          looks at her, remembering. With him is Agent Coulson.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           As soon as Loki took the doctor we

           moved Jane Foster. We've got an

           excellent observatory in Traunsee. She

           was asked to consult there very

           suddenly yesterday. Handsome fee,

           private plane, very remote. She'll be

           safe.

                          THOR

           Thank you. It's no accident Loki taking

           Erik Selvig. I dread what he plans for

           him once he's done. Erik is a good man.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           He talks about you a lot. You changed

           his life. You changed everything around

           here.

                          THOR

           They were better as they were. We

           pretend on Asgard that we're more

           advanced, but we...we come here

           battling like BILCHSTEIM.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           Like what?

                          THOR

           BILCHSTEIM? You know; huge, scaly, big

           antlers. You don't have those?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           Don't think so.

                          THOR

           They are repulsive, and they trample

           everything in their path.

          Thor walks over to the side of the ship and looks out the

          window, lamenting about what has happened and what may come.

                          THOR

           When I first came to earth, Loki's rage

           followed me here and your people paid

           the price. And now again. In my youth I

           courted war.

           NICK FURY (O.S.)

           War hasn't started yet.

                          (WALKING IN)

           You think you can make Loki tell us

           what the Tesseract is?

                          THOR

           I do not know. Loki's mind is far

           afield, it's not just power he craves,

           it's vengeance upon me. There's no pain

           that would prize his need from him.

                          NICK FURY

           A lot of guys think that, until the

           pain stops.

                          THOR

           What are you asking me to do?

                          NICK FURY

           I'm asking. What are you prepared to

           do?

                          THOR

           Loki is a prisoner.

                          NICK FURY

           Then why do I feel like he's the only

           person on this boat that wants to be

           here?

          Thor doesn't answer.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION  NIGHT

          Loki walks back and forth inside his glass cell. Suddenly, he

          stops.

                          LOKI

           There's not many people that can sneak

           up on me.

           (turns to see NATASHA

                          STANDING THERE)

                          NATASHA

           But you figured I'd come.

                          LOKI

           After. After whatever tortures Fury can

           concoct, you would appear as a friend,

           as a balm. And I would cooperate.

                          NATASHA

          I wanna know what you've done to Agent

          Barton.

                          LOKI

          I'd say I've expanded his mind.

                          NATASHA

          And once you've won. Once you're king

          of the mountain. What happens to his

          mind?

                          LOKI

          Is this love, Agent Romanoff?

                          NATASHA

          Love is for children. I owe him a debt.

                          LOKI

                          (SITTING DOWN)

          Tell me.

                          NATASHA

           (she pulls up a chair as

                          WELL)

          Before I worked for SHIELD, I

          uh...well, I made a name for myself. I

          have a very specific skillset. I didn't

          care who I used it for, or on. I got on

          SHIELD's radar in a bad way. Agent

          Barton was sent to kill me, he made a

          different call.

                          LOKI

          And what will you do if I vow to spare

          him?

                          NATASHA

          Not let you out.

                          LOKI

                          (LAUGHS)

          Ah, no. But I like this. Your world in

          the balance, and you bargain for one

          man?

                          NATASHA

           Regimes fall every day. I tend not to

           weep over that, I'm Russian... or was.

                          LOKI

           What is it you want?

                          NATASHA

           It's really not that complicated. I've

           got red in my ledger, I'd like to wipe

           it out.

                          LOKI

           Can you? Can you wipe out that much

           red? DRAKOV'S daughter? SAO PAULO? THE

           HOSPITAL FIRE? Barton told me

           everything. Your ledger is dripping,

           it's gushing red, and you think saving

           a man no more virtuous than yourself

           will change anything?

                          (STANDING; ANGRY)

           This is the basest sentimentality. This

           is a child at prayer... PATHETIC!

                         INTERCUTS

          - Tony and Banner continuously work at their monitors.

           LOKI (V.O.)

           You lie and kill in the service of

           liars and killers.

          - Agent Hill checks every VIEWSCREEN in the bridge. Fury

          oversees.

           LOKI (V.O.)

           You pretend to be separate, to have

           your own code, something that makes up

           for the horrors. But they are a part of

           you, and they will never go away!

          - Steve opens a STEEL crate. Angry, he looks behind him and

          looks back into the crate. THE CRATE IS FILLED WITH AN ARRAY OF

          HYDRA WEAPONS.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION  NIGHT

          Loki SLAMS his cell, making Natasha FLINCH.

                          LOKI

           I won't touch Barton. Not until I make

           him kill you! Slowly. Intimately. In

           every way he knows you fear! And when

           he'll wake just long enough to see his

           good work, and when he screams, I'll

           split his skull! This is my bargain,

           you mewling quim!

          NATASHA turns around, walks away from Loki, disgusted.

                          NATASHA

                          (QUIETLY; DISTRAUGHT)

           You're a monster.

                          LOKI

                          (LAUGHS)

           No, you brought the monster.

                          NATASHA

           (turns back around; poised)

           So, Banner... that's your play.

                          LOKI

                          (STAGGERED)

           What?

                          NATASHA

                          (ON EARPIECE)

           Loki means to unleash the Hulk. Keep

           Banner in the lab, I'm on my way. Send

           Thor as well.

                          (TO LOKI)

           Thank you for your cooperation.

          Natasha quickly walks out, leaving Loki frozen.

          INT. BANNER'S LAB  MORNING

          Fury walks in SURPRISED to see Tony and Banner stop working on

          the scepter.

                          NICK FURY

                          (ANGRY)

           What are you doing, Mr. Stark?

                          TONY

           Uh...kind of been wondering the same

           thing about you.

                          NICK FURY

           You're supposed to be locating the

           Tesseract.

                          BANNER

           We are. The model's locked and we're

           sweeping for the signature now. When we

           get a hit, we'll have the location

           within half a mile.

                          TONY

           And you'll get your cube back, no muss,

           no fuss.

           (suddenly his monitor show a

           collection of SECRET FILES)

           What is PHASE 2?

          Suddenly, Steve drops a HYDRA ASSAULT RIFLE on the table causing

          Fury, Banner and Tony to turn around. Cap looks pissed.

                          STEVE

           PHASE 2 is SHIELD uses the cube to make

           weapons.

                          (TO TONY)

           Sorry, the computer was moving a little

           slow.

                          NICK FURY

           (trying to explain)

           Rogers, we gathered everything related

           to the Tesseract. This does not mean

           that we're...

                          TONY

           I'm sorry, Nick.

          Tony moves the computer screen towards Fury which shows plans of

          THE WEAPONS.

                          TONY

           What were you lying?

                          STEVE

           I was wrong, director. The world hasn't

           changed a bit.

          At that moment, Thor and Natasha walk into the lab. Natasha

          keeps her eyes right on Banner. Banner looks at her, PISSED.

                          BANNER

           Did you know about this?

                          NATASHA

           You wanna think about removing yourself

           from this environment, doctor?

                          BANNER

           I was in Calcutta, I was pretty well

           removed.

                          NATASHA

           Loki's manipulating you.

                          BANNER

           And you've been doing what exactly?

                          NATASHA

           You didn't come here because I bat my

           eyelashes at you.

                          BANNER

           Yes, and I'm not leaving because

           suddenly you get a little twitchy. I'd

           like to know why SHIELD is using the

           Tesseract to build weapons of mass

           destruction.

                          NICK FURY

           Because of him.

           (pointing at Thor)

                          THOR

                          (STUNNED)

           Me?

                          NICK FURY

          Last year earth had a visitor from

          another planet who had a grudge match

          that leveled a small town. We learned

          that not only are we not alone, but we

          are hopelessly, hilariously, outgunned.

                          THOR

          My people want nothing but peace with

          your planet.

                          NICK FURY

          But you're not the only people out

          there, are you? And, you're not the

          only threat. The world's filling up

          with people who can't be matched, they

          can't be controlled.

                          STEVE

          Like you controlled the cube?

                          THOR

          You're work with the Tesseract is what

          drew Loki to it, and his allies. It is

          the signal to all the realms that the

          earth is ready for a higher form of

          war.

                          STEVE

          A higher form?

                          NICK FURY

          You forced our hand. We had to come up

          with something.

                          TONY

          Nuclear deterrent. `Cause that always

          calms everything right down.

                          NICK FURY

          Remind me again how you made your

          fortune, Stark?

                          STEVE TONY

          I'm sure if he still made Wait! Wait! Hold on! How is

          weapons, Stark would be neck this now about me?

          deep... I'm sorry, isn't THOR

          everything?

           I thought humans were more

           evolved than this.

                          NICK FURY

           Excuse me, did WE come to YOUR planet

           and blow stuff up?

                          THOR

           Did you always give your champions such

           mistrust?

                          NATASHA BANNER

          Are you all really that Captain America is on

          naive? S.H.I.E.L.D monitors potential threat potential

          threats? watch list?

                          TONY STEVE

           (to Steve) I swear to God, Stark, one

          You're on that list? Are you more crack...

          above or below angry bees?

          Threatening! I feel

          threatened!

          As the "team" argues, they don't realize the BLUE GEM on Loki's

          scepter is glowing brightly.

          INT. AIRCRAFT CARRIER  DAY

          Outside the HELICARRIER, a lone carrier slowly hovers over the

          ship.

           SHIELD BASE VOICE

           661 Bravo, please relay your pass code.

           What is your hull, over?

                          BARTON

           Arms to ammunition, over.

          Inside, BARTON and his crew suit up and arm themselves. Barton

          pulls out his hi-tech bow and arrows.

          INT. BANNER'S LAB  MORNING

          Back in the lab, the egos of these people keeping rubbing off

          each other and at any moment, the shit will hit the fan.

                          THOR

           You speak of control, yet you court

           chaos.

                          BANNER

           It's his M.O., isn't it? I mean, what

           are we, a team? No, no, no. We're a

           chemical mixture that makes chaos.

           We're... we're a time-bomb.

                          NICK FURY

           You need to step away.

                          TONY

           (puts his arm around Steve)

           Why shouldn't the guy let off a little

           steam?

                          STEVE

           (pushes Tony off)

           You know damn well why! Back off!

                          TONY

           (comes face-to-face with Cap)

           Oh, I'm starting to want you to make

           me.

                          STEVE

           Big man in a suit of armor. Take that

           off, what are you?

                          TONY

           Genius, billionaire, playboy,

           philanthropist.

                          STEVE

           I know guys with none of that worth ten

           of you. Yeah, I've seen the footage.

                          (MORE)

                          STEVE (CONT'D)

           The only thing you really fight for is

           yourself. You're not the guy to make

           the sacrifice play, to lay down on a

           wire and let the other guy crawl over

           you.

                          TONY

           I think I would just cut the wire.

                          STEVE

                          (SMILING)

           Always a way out... You know, you may

           not be a threat, but you better stop

           pretending to be a hero.

                          TONY

           (that did it)

           A hero? Like you? You're a lab rat,

           Rogers. Everything special about you

           came out of a bottle!

          OUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER

          The ramp of the carrier opens. The carrier maneuvers next to one

          of the large turbine engines. Barton stands at the base, holding

          out his bow. He pulls out a GRENADE TIPPED ARROW. He points

          right at the engine.

          Then...Barton moves his AIM and points the arrow about a hundred

          feet from the engine. He releases. The arrow flies out,but then

          SHARPLY heads for the engine. The arrow is punctured onto the

          engine. It has a visible timer which is COUNTING DOWN.

          INT. BANNER'S LAB  MORNING

          Back in the lab, Steve puffs up his chest at Tony, who just

          stands there, unmoving.

                          STEVE

           Put on the suit, let's go a few rounds.

          Thor laughs at them.

                          THOR

           You people are so petty... and tiny.

          Tony rubs his head. Moves away from Cap.

                          BANNER

           Yeah, this is a tee...

                          NICK FURY

           Agent Romanoff, would you escort

           Dr.Banner back to his...

                          BANNER

           Where? You rented my room.

                          NICK FURY

           The cell was just in case...

                          BANNER

           In case you needed to kill me, but you

           can't! I know! I tried!

                          (A BEAT)

           I got low. I didn't see an end, so I

           put a bullet in my mouth and the other

           guy spit it out! So I moved on. I

           focused on helping other people. I was

           good, until you dragged me back into

           this freak show and put everyone here

           at risk!

          Banner slowly gets upset as he looks at Romanoff, who gets

          unnerved.

                          BANNER

           You wanna know my secret, Agent

           Romanoff? You wanna know how I stay

           calm?

          BLACK WIDOW and Fury have their hands down to grab their guns.

                          STEVE

           Doctor Banner... put down the scepter.

          BANNER LOOKS DOWN AND IS SHOCKED TO SEE HE'S HOLDING LOKI'S

          SCEPTER. The computer beeps. They all turn to it.

                          TONY

           Got it.

          Banner puts down the scepter and walks over to the computer.

                          BANNER

           Sorry, kids. You don't get to see my

           little party trick after all.

                          THOR

           Located the Tesseract?

                          TONY

           I can get there faster.

                          STEVE

           Look, all of us...

                          THOR

           The Tesseract belongs on Asgard, no

           human is a match for it.

          Tony turns to leave, but Steve stops him.

                          STEVE

           You're not going alone!

                          TONY

           You gonna stop me?

                          STEVE

           Put on the suit, let's find out.

                          TONY

           I'm not afraid to hit an old man.

                          STEVE

           Put on the suit.

          At that moment Banner who's looking at the monitor notices

          something about the Tesseract.

                          BANNER

           Oh, my God!

          OUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER

          Barton PULLS THE TRIGGER ON HIS BOW. The arrow then EXPLODES THE

          ENGINE RIGHT OFF THE HELICARRIER!

          INT. BANNER'S LAB  MORNING

          Everyone is thrown in every direction. Steve, Fury, Thor and

          Tony are thrown across while Natasha and Banner is down in the

          lower equipment room. Steve looks up at Tony.

                          STEVE

           Put on the suit!

                          TONY

           Yep!

          Steve helps Tony up and out of the lab. Fury sits up, clutching

          his ribs. He puts on his EARPIECE.

                          NICK FURY

           Hill?!

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

          PANDEMONIUM ERUPTS. Emergency alarms set off, fire extinguishers

          activate near surrounding fires and every agent is in a spinning

          scramble for their positions and armaments. Agent Hill keeps the

          bridge as calm as possible.

           AGENT MARIA HILL

           Turn up that engine! Number 3 engine is

           down! Can we get a run in?

           (runs over to GALAGA PLAYER)

           Talk to me.

                          GALAGA PLAYER

           (points to monitor)

           Turbine's loose. Mostly intact, but

           it's impossible to get out there and

           make repairs while we're in the air.

           AGENT MARIA HILL

           We lose one more engine, we won't be.

           Somebody's got to get inside and patch

           that engine.

          INT. BANNER'S LAB  MORNING

                          NICK FURY

           Stark! You copy that?!

           TONY (V.O.)

           I'm on it!

                          NICK FURY

           Coulson! Initiate official lock down in

           the detention section then get to the

           armory! Move out!

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

          Agent Coulson runs out of the bridge.

          INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER  MORNING

          Natasha looks over to Banner, who is breathing heavy, having

          landed hard. He is gripping the grated floor to maintain

          control, but his eyes are green, his face intense.

                          NATASHA (CONT'D)

           (quietly, to herself)

           I'm okay. We're okay, right?

          EXT. HELICARRIER DECK  DAY

          Barton leads his men into the air ducts of the ship. They rappel

          down into a corridor.

                          BARTON

           Get that engine down! Detention! Get

           him through the dark! Come with me.

          Two of his men follow him. They head towards the bridge.

          EXT. ND HALLWAY, CARRIER  MORNING

          Tony and Cap run through a dim, debris filled hall.

                          TONY

           Find engine three. I'll meet you there.

          Cap peels off as Tony approaches a tech room. Inside, Tony's

          IRON MAN suit stands waiting, lit above in all its glory.

          INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER  CONTINUOUS

          ON BANNER'S FACE in the dim light as he struggles to suppress

          the rage, but his face is growing, changing slowly.

          Natasha is pulling herself painfully free, talking to Banner...

                          NATASHA

           Doctor... Bruce, you gotta fight it.

           This is just what Loki wants. We're

           gonna be okay. Listen to me.

          Two approaching SHIELD soldiers arrive to check on her. She

          furiously WAVES them away. They bolt out of there.

                          NATASHA

           We're gonna be okay. Right? I swear on

           my life I will get you out of this, you

           will walk away, and never...

                          BANNER

           Your life?

          His voice has the change in it -- the bitter amusement is

          morphing to a growled threat. Another explosion rocks the

          carrier -- and he turns to look at her, transforming just as the

          lights go out.

                          NATASHA

                          (PLEADING)

           Bruce.

          Banner suddenly starts transforming into the HULK and gives

          Natasha one last knowing look. Natasha STRUGGLES FREE of the

          rubble. She stops.

          The HULK, sensing her, turns his head and puts on a face of a

          disturb monster. Natasha JOLTS up the stairs with the HULK

          chasing after her. Natasha maneuvers like a black widow should.

          She rolls under a turbine, starts to crawl within the maze of

          pipes. The HULK pulls them out from above the catwalk.

          Natasha falls through under the catwalks and quickly and

          stealthily escapes. The HULK lets out a ROAR OF RAGE unlike

          anything. PRIMAL. Not human.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION  DAY

          Loki looks up, smiling mischievously.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

          Fury RUNS in and sees the chaos has increased even more than

          before. The HELMSMAN is in complete disarray.

                          NICK FURY

           Bring the carrier inwards and head

           south. Take us to the water.

                          HELMSMAN

           Why water? Navigations recalibrated

           after the engine failure.

                          NICK FURY

           Is the sun coming up?!

                          HELMSMAN

           Yes, sir.

                          NICK FURY

           Then put it on the left! Get us over

           water! One more turbine goes down and

           we drop.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE  DAY

          CAPTAIN AMERICA, pushing with all his strength the door to

          portside, sees SHIELD tech in full oxygen masks shoot fire

          extinguishers and cover from sparks -- largely unable to do

          anything.

          Engine 3 is totally dead. A LARGE CHUNK of the port side in TORN

          OFF.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           Stark, I'm here!

                          TONY

           Good. See what we got.

          Tony flies in his IRON MAN suit and gets close to the damaged

          engine.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

          Tony observes within his viewscreen at the damaged engine and

          its layouts.

                          TONY

           I gotta get this super conducting

           cooling system back online before I can

           access the rotors and work on

           dislodging the debris.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE  DAY

          IRON MAN begins PULLING on the stuck rotors. Looks over atSteve.

                          IRON MAN

           I need you to get to that engine

           control panel and tell me which relays

           are in overload position.

          IRON MAN flies into giant cooling conductors. CAPTAIN AMERICA

          JUMPS over to the other side of the broken railing. CAPTAIN

          AMERICA gets himself to the control panel and opens it up. For a

          man who grew up as a YANK, what the fuck is this!

                          IRON MAN

           What's it look like in there?

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           It seems to run on some form of

           electricity.

                          IRON MAN

           Well, you're not wrong.

          INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER  DAY

          Natasha continuously crawls under the catwalk. She stops.

          Then...BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. The room vibrates. Rhythmically.

          Natasha pulls out her gun and slowly walks out onto the catwalk

          and spins.

          ...and then a ROAR. THE HULK. Natasha FIRES a shot into a liquid

          nitrogen pipe that hits the hulk in face. The HULK SMASHES THE

          SHIT OUT OF IT. Natasha begins to run through the maze of

          corridors. The sound the monster is coming.

          Finally, she reaches and a long corridor. As she runs, behind

          her, the HULK TEARS up the hallway, coming at her.

          Natasha turns to see, but the HULK SLAPS her into the wall,

          SMASHING INTO THE GROUND.

          The HULK marks his territory. Natasha looks up. A fear she has

          never felt begins to seep out. The HULK raises his hand and IS

          KNOCKED OFF HIS FEET BY THOR WHO TACKLES HIM INTO the next room.

          INT. HELICARRIER AIRCRAFT PORT  CONTINUOUS

          Both Thor and HULK roll across the floor. Every person runs the

          hell out. Thor looks up at this magnificent beast. The HULK

          stands up and moving like a boxer, wants Thor to make his move.

          The HULK makes his move.

          SWING AND A MISS. Thor swings his massive hand and almost knocks

          HULK off his feet. HULK keeps swinging and missing, pissing him

          off. Finally, he brings down his arm, but Thor grabs it and

          wraps around it.

                          THOR

           We are not your enemies, Banner! Try to

           think!

          HULK lifts his arm up, to Thor's surprise, and he SENDS HIM

          FLYING AS HE PUNCHES THOR'S FACE WITH HIS FIST.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE  DAY

          IRON MAN continuously BLASTS broken debris off the turbine

          engine. It's bad, but still fixable.

           CAPTAIN AMERICA (V.O.)

           The relays are intact. What's our next

           move?

                          TONY

           Even if I clear the rotors, this thing

           won't re-engage without a jump. I'm

           gonna have to get in there and push.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE  DAY

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           Well if that thing gets up to speed,

           you'll get shredded!

                          TONY

           Then stay in the control unit and

           reverse polarity long enough to

           disengage mag...

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           Speak English!

                          TONY

           See that red lever? It'll slow the

           rotors down long enough for me to get

           out. Stand by it, wait for my word.

          CAPTAIN AMERICA looks over at the other side where he was. He

          sees the red lever and JUMPS towards it.

          INT. HELICARRIER AIRCRAFT PORT  DAY

          Thor CRASHES into another stack of crates. As he raises his

          head, he feels something on his lips. BLOOD. As he swipes it

          off, the ROAR of the HULK is not too far. Thor extends his hand

          out.

          The ROAR gets LOUDER and CLOSER. Thor focuses. His hand strains

          toward mid-air. His eyes tight in concentration. The HULK runs

          right at him. At the last second, MJOLNIR flies into his hand

          and Thor UPPERCUTS HULK, WHO CRASHES INTO A FIGHTER JET.

          HULK stands up, shaking his head like `what the fuck just

          happened.' He SHAKES it off and ANGRILY rips off the TAIL of the

          jet, TORQUES HIS BODY LIKE A GREEK DISCUS THROWER AND... HURLS

          THE MASSIVE PLATE AT THOR.

          Thor SLIDES and DUCKS under the tail. Jumping up, he throws

          Mjolnir with all his strength, knocking the HULK head over

          heels. HULK falls down, hammer in hand. HE tries to lift it, but

          can't. Mjolnir rests atop his hand.

          Struggle as he may, HULK wraps his hand around the hammer. The

          hammer doesn't move. To no avail -- he strains with all his

          might, SCREAMS from the effort, BELLOWING.

          Thor jumps up again, KNEEING HULK in the face. Thor grabs his

          hammer, jumps on him, using the hammer as a lock for his

          CHOKEHOLD. Hulk tries to pull him off.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

          Fury and Agent Hill look over their monitors.

                          NICK FURY

           We need a full evac on the lower hangar

           bay.

          Agent Hill nods. She leaves to exit out, but a SLIDING GRENADE

          appears.

           AGENT MARIA HILL

           GRENADE!

          The grenade goes off, sending her down the steps. Fury FIRES a

          shot at the open entrance. He moves over behind the side of the

          entrance. A handful of Barton's men enter. Watchful, ready,

          waiting... Fury steps out, his GUN drawn.

          A SHOOT OUT and HAND-TO-HAND ensues, but Fury is unable to stop

          one of them, which is why he is shot in the head by Agent Hill,

          who looks hot and sexy holding her gun.

          INT. HELICARRIER ARMORY SECTION  DAY

          Agent Coulson walks up the armory door. He places his head into

          a FACIAL RECOGNITION SCANNER. Walks into the room.

           AGENT JASPER SITWELL (V.O.)

           We got perimeter breach! Hostiles are

           in SHIELD gear. Hold on to every

           junction.

          INT. HELICARRIER AIRCRAFT PORT  DAY

          HULK CRASHES from under the floor, sending Thor on his ass. HULK

          grabs him by the neck.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

          A gunfight opens up. AGENTS exchange fire with brutally

          efficient tactical soldiers.

           AGENT JASPER SITWELL (V.O.)

           Sir, the HULK and Thor are in shuttle

           levels 2, 3 and 4!

           AGENT MARIA HILL

           Sir, the Hulk will tear this place

           apart!

                          NICK FURY

           Get his attention.

           AGENT MARIA HILL

           (on her EARPIECE)

           (pulls the trigger; fires

           guns at HULK)

          A SHOWER OF BULLETS SPRAYS THE HULK EVERYWHERE. Thor ducks for

          cover. The HULK turns around, letting out his PRIMAL ROAR. He

          jumps up, TAKES A RUNNING START AND LEAPS...

          ESCORT 606 PILOT LOOKS LIKE HE TOOK A SHIT.

                          ESCORT 606 PILOT

           TARGET ANGRY! TARGET ANGRY!

          HULK LANDS ON THE JET'S NOSE. THE JET SPINS WILDLY. As the HULK

          tears it apart, ESCORT 606 PILOT pulls his ejection seat, but

          HOLD THE FUCKIN' DOOR!

          THE HULK CATCHES HIM, WAVES HIM AROUND AND THEN THROWS HIM AWAY.

          ESCORT 606 PILOT pulls his parachute. THE JET EXPLODES. THE HULK

          PLUMMETS TO EARTH, ROARING HIS SWAN SONG.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE  DAY

          IRON MAN laser cuts a big piece of broken metal. He then JUMPS

          on it, relieving the rotors.

          On the other side, BARTON'S men enter the port side. CAPTAIN

          AMERICA looks down, pondering if they are help. Evidently not as

          they begin SHOOTING at him and throwing grenades.

          CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps to the other railing and down with

          Barton's men. He begins to TAKE THEM DOWN, even goes as far as

          throwing one off. A few more enter, FIRING.

          CAPTAIN AMERICA grabs a NOVESKE RIFLEWORKS DIPLOMAT (big word

          for big fuckin' gun) and jumps back up to his position, firing

          down at them.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

          The gunfight has gone down, but more of Barton's men enter and

          are taken by Fury, who is confused as to why they keep coming.

                          NICK FURY

           They are not getting through here, so

           what the hell...

          Suddenly, Barton LOOSES an arrow down to the bridge and EXPLODES

          critical spots. Barton releases a multi-tipped arrow towards

          Fury, but instead hits his command desk, right above a USB

          OUTLETS.

          Fury FIRES at Barton, but is already gone. The arrow then self-

          activates and inserts itself into the outlets, hacking every

          single monitor and main frame. The hacking causes Engine 1 to

          shut off. Suddenly, the HELICARRIER begins to DANGEROUSLY TILT

          to one side.

           AGENT JASPER SITWELL (O.S.)

           Sir, we've lost all power in Engine 1.

                          NICK FURY

           It's Barton. He took out our systems.

           He's headed for the detention level.

           Does anybody copy?

          INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER- DAY

          Still shaken by the HULK ordeal, Natasha sits there, rocking

          back and forth, after crying for a while. Summoning back all her

          coolness, she touches her EARPIECE.

                          NATASHA

           This is Agent Romanoff. I copy.

          Natasha SPRINGS up and runs for Barton.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE  DAY

          IRON MAN begins to push the rotor using BOOSTERS from his boots.

           NICK FURY (V.O.)

           Stark, we're losing altitude.

                          IRON MAN

           Yeah. Noticed.

          The rotors start propelling faster and faster as IRON MAN'S

          BOOSTERS get more and more bright.

          On the other side, CAPTAIN AMERICA continuously shoots at

          Barton's men. Blinking at the wrong moment, CAPTAIN AMERICA

          loses the upper hand and SLIDES off the railing, but grabs onto

          a LOOSE CABLE.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION  DAY

          Thor runs into the detention section where he finds Loki,

          escaping.

                          THOR

           NO!

          Thor CHARGES at his brother. Loki walks up to him and CROUCHES

          down to attack. THOR ONLY GOES THROUGH HIM. The false Loki

          dissipates into nothingness. THE REAL LOKI comes out from behind

          the cell door, which closes on THOR, locking him up. Loki

          smiles.

                          LOKI

           Are you ever not going to fall for

           that?

          INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER  DAY

          Barton walks alone down the catwalk. In a lightning fast move,

          Barton nocks an arrow, and points it at NATASHA. A hand-to-hand

          fight ensues. Natasha CRAWLS her way around Barton, making

          Barton to drop his bow, but pulls out a KNIFE on her.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION  DAY

          Thor, in a fit of anger, SLAMS MJOLNIR onto the glass cell. To

          his surprise, the cell door only CRACKS, but violently SHAKES

          the ship. Loki stands there in caution, as does his GUARDING

          SOLDIER.

                          LOKI

           (smiles; walks over to the

                          CONTROL PANEL)

           The humans think us immortal. Should we

           test that?

          Suddenly, GUARDING SOLDIER falls down like a tree. AGENT COULSON

          stands there, holding PHASE 2 WEAPON PROTOTYPE.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           Move away, please.

          Loki moves away from the switch.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           You like this? We started working on

           the prototype after you sent THE

           DESTROYER. Even I don't know what it

           does. Do you wanna find out?

          A LOUD GASP. AGENT COULSON IS IMPALED THROUGH THE HEART. THE

          REAL LOKI STANDS BEHIND COULSON.

                          THOR

           Nooo!

          Loki sends Agent Coulson against the wall. Agent Coulson slumps

          down, breathing fast. Loki makes his way to the control switch.

          He gives his brother one last look. Thor looks at him, hopeful.

          Loki opens the HATCH. Thor still hopes. LOKI HITS THE BUTTON AND

          DROPS THOR OUT OF THE SHIP.

          INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER  DAY

          Barton and Natasha continue attacking each other. Natasha

          KICKBOXES Barton's face. Feeling that, Barton takes a SWING at

          her, but she grabs his arm, TWISTING it. BARTON WRITHES IN PAIN.

          Using his other arm, he tosses the knife over and begins to

          SLASH at Natasha. She dodges every move, but finds herself in a

          LOCK HOLD with him. As he forces the knife down, she BITES his

          wrist. Barton lets go of the knife.

          Natasha WRAPS her legs around his neck, FLIPS him over and arm

          LOCKS him. She SLAMS his head into a pipes rail. Barton goes

          down, hard. He looks up her, almost coming to his real senses.

                          BARTON

           Natasha...

          Natasha COLDCOCKS him. Barton is out.

          EXT. SKY

          Thor, trapped in the glass cage, BOUNCES off the JUMBLING cell

          pod. As it draws closer to land, Thor tries to swing at glass,

          but misses. Land draws closer.

          In a final attempt before crashing, Thor positions himself onto

          the glass door and LEAPFROGS just as the cage is about to hit

          the ground. The cell CRASHES into the shore as Thor crashes out

          into the meadow.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION  DAY

          Loki has no remorse as he looks down. He closes the hatch and

          proceeds to leave. A WEAK VOICE.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           You're gonna lose.

                          LOKI

                          (TURNING)

           Am I?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           It's in your nature.

                          LOKI

           Your heroes are scattered, your

           floating fortress falls from the

           sky...where is my disadvantage?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           You lack conviction.

                          LOKI

           I don't think I...

          AGENT COULSON SHOOTS LOKI WITH HIS PHASE 2 WEAPON PROTOTYPE,

          CAUSING LOKI TO BE BLOWN THROUGH THE WALL BEHIND HIM.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           So that's what it does.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

          Back in the bridge, Fury sees on his VIEWSCREEN that the hatch

          has been open. Knowing Agent Coulson was sent there, he goes to.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE  DAY

          IRON MAN continuously SPINS Engine 3, giving it all he has. THE

          ROTORS ARE PROPELLING PROPERLY AND FAST. The HELICARRIER LEVELS

          itself.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY

           Cap, I need the lever!

           STEVE (V.O.)

           I need a minute here!

                          TONY

           Lever. Now!

          Tony lets go of the rotors. They spin by themselves. Tony is

          then caught in one. He is now fucked. IRON MAN slips into the

          rotors, getting chewed up.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE  DAY

          CAPTAIN AMERICA CLIMBS up the loose cable and reaches the

          railing.

          BARTON'S MAN opens fire once more. CAPTAIN AMERICA pulls himself

          up and finally PULLS the lever.

          A VENT opens up from Engine 3. IRON MAN falls out, but the suit

          heavily damaged, hardly keeping him up. IRON MAN heads for Cap.

          BARTON'S MAN turns his AIM to IRON MAN, who TACKLES him into the

          wall. IRON MAN rolls over, tired. Cap lets out a sigh of relief.

          OUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER

          The carrier that brought Barton and his team now leaves, taking

          Loki and his scepter. The carrier flies into the distance.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION  DAY

          Fury runs in finding Agent Coulson still alive, barely.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           Sorry, boss. They got rabbited.

                          NICK FURY

           Just stay awake. EYES ON ME!

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           No. I'm clocked out here.

                          NICK FURY

           Not an option.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

           It's okay, boss. This was never going

           to work... if they didn't have

           something... to...

          Agent Coulson looks away. Sighs his last breath. Nick Fury looks

          on grimly at Coulson. The medical team arrives.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

           NICK FURY (V.O.)

           Agent Coulson is down.

          Agent Hill is being treated for a gash on her head, listens on

          her headset, standing up.

           SHIELD AGENT (V.O.)

           Paramedics are on their way.

           NICK FURY (V.O.)

           They're here.

          INT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE  DAY

          Steve and Tony listen in as well.

           NICK FURY (V.O.)

           They called it.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  LATER

          Fury gathers Tony and Steve back into the briefing room everyone

          there has a look as if in a daze. A look of numb shock is shown

          on their devastated faces.

                          NICK FURY

           These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.

           Guess he never did get you to sign

           them.

          Fury throws Coulson's CAPTAIN AMERICA TRADING CARDS on the table

          towards Steve. Steve picks them up, STAINED WITH BLOOD.

                          NICK FURY

           We're dead in the air up here. Our

           communications, location of the cube,

           Banner, Thor. I got nothing for you.

           Lost my one good eye. Maybe I had that

           coming.

                          (A BEAT)

           Yes, we were going to build an arsenal

           with the Tesseract. I never put all my

           chips on that number though, because I

           was playing something even riskier.

           There was an idea, Stark knows this,

           called THE AVENGERS INITIATIVE. The

           idea was to bring together a group of

           remarkable people, see if they could

           become something more. See if they

           could work together when we needed them

           to, to fight the battles that we never

           could. Phil Coulson died still

           believing in that idea, in heroes.

          Tony gets up and walks off, not wanting to hear it anymore.

                          NICK FURY

           Well, it's an old fashioned notion.

          EXT. MEADOW  DAY

          Thor walks out far into the meadow. He looks down. MJOLNIR.

          INT. ABANDONED BUILDING  DAY

          Banner wakes up, in human form. He looks around and sees he is

          IN A PILE OF RUBBLE and looks up at the OPEN CEILING HE CRASHED

          IN. AND IS COMPLETELY NAKED. A SECURITY GUARD stands there,

          amazed.

                          SECURITY GUARD

           You fell out of the sky.

                          BANNER

                          (COMING TO)

           Did I hurt anybody?

                          SECURITY GUARD

           There's nobody around here to get hurt.

           You did scare the hell out of some

           pigeons though.

                          BANNER

           Lucky.

                          SECURITY GUARD

           Or just good aim. You were awake when

           you fell.

                          BANNER

           You saw?

                          SECURITY GUARD

           The whole thing, right through the

           ceiling. Big and green and buck ass

           nude. Here...

          He throws Banner a pair of big pants. Banner pulls on his pants.

                          SECURITY GUARD

           I didn't think those would fit you

           until you shrunk down to a regular size

           fella.

                          BANNER

           Thank you.

          A beat.

                          SECURITY GUARD

           Are you an alien?

                          BANNER

           What?

                          SECURITY GUARD

           From outer space, an alien?

                          BANNER

           No.

                          SECURITY GUARD

           Well then, son, you've got a condition.

          INT. HELICARRIER MEDICAL ROOM  DAY

          Barton is strapped down. Natasha watches over him as Barton

          tries to shake off Loki's mind control.

                          NATASHA

           Clint, you're gonna be alright.

                          CLINT BARTON

           You know that? Is that what you know? I

           got...I gotta go in though. I gotta

           flush him out.

                          NATASHA

           We don't have that long, it's gonna

           take time.

                          CLINT BARTON

           I don't understand. Have you ever had

           someone take your brain and play? Pull

           you out and send something else in? Do

           you know what it's like to be unmade?

                          NATASHA

          You know that I do.

                          CLINT BARTON

          Why am I back? How did you get him out?

                          NATASHA

          Cognitive recalibration. I hit you

          really hard in the head.

                          CLINT BARTON

          Thanks.

           (Natasha unfastens the

                          RESTRAINTS)

          Tasha, how many agents?

                          NATASHA

          Don't. Don't do that to yourself,

          Clint. This is Loki. This is monsters

          and magic and nothing we were ever

          trained for.

                          CLINT BARTON

          Loki, he got away?

                          NATASHA

          Yeah. I don't suppose you know where?

                          CLINT BARTON

          I didn't need to know. I didn't ask.

          He's gonna make his play soon though.

          Today.

                          NATASHA

          We gotta stop him.

                          CLINT BARTON

          Yeah? Who's we?

                          NATASHA

          I don't know. Whoever's left.

                          CLINT BARTON

          Well, if I put an arrow in Loki's

          eyesocket, I'd sleep better I suppose.

                          NATASHA

          Now you sound like you.

          Natasha sits next to her partner and friend.

                          CLINT BARTON

           But you don't. You're a spy, not a

           soldier. Now you want to wade into a

           war. Why? What did Loki do to you?

                          NATASHA

           He didn't, I just...

                          (SHE PAUSES)

                          CLINT BARTON

           Natasha.

                          NATASHA

           I've been compromised. I got red in my

           ledger. I'd like to wipe it out.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION  DAY

          Tony look at the empty cell container. He stands not saying a

          word. Steve walks in.

                          STEVE

           Was he married?

                          TONY

           No. There was a uh...cellist, I think.

                          STEVE

           I'm sorry. He seemed like a good man.

                          TONY

           He was an idiot.

                          STEVE

           Why? For believing?

                          TONY

           For taking on Loki alone.

                          STEVE

           He was doing his job.

                          TONY

           He was out of his league. He should

           have waited. He should have...

                          STEVE

          Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.

                          TONY

                          (WALKS AWAY)

          Right. How did that work for him?

                          STEVE

          Is this the first time you've lost a

          soldier?

                          TONY

           (turns around sharply)

          WE ARE NOT SOLDIERS! I am not marching

          to Fury's fife!

                          STEVE

          Neither am I! He's got the same blood

          on his hands as Loki does. Right now

          we've got to put that aside and get

          this done. Now Loki needs a power

          source, if we can put together a

          list...

                          TONY

           (looking at the blood stained

                          WALL)

          He made it personal.

                          STEVE

          That's not the point.

                          TONY

          That is the point. That's Loki's point.

          He hit us all right where we live. Why?

                          STEVE

          To tear us apart.

                          TONY

          He had to conquer his greed, but he

          knows he has to take us out to win,

          right? That's what he wants. He wants

          to beat us and he wants to be seen

          doing it. He wants an audience.

                          STEVE

           Right, I caught his act at Stuttengard.

                          TONY

           Yeah. That's just a preview, this is

           opening night. Loki's a full-tilt diva.

           He wants flowers, he wants parades, he

           wants a monument built in the skies

           with his name plastered...

                          (PAUSE)

           Sonofabitch!

          EXT. STARK TOWER  DAY

          Selvig works around the CMS device that has already been set-

          upon the rooftop of Tony's tower.

          INT. HELICARRIER MEDICAL ROOM  DAY

          Steve walks in full uniform. Natasha looks at him, unprepared.

                          STEVE

           Time to go.

                          NATASHA

           Go where?

                          STEVE

           I'll tell you on the way. Can you fly

           one of those jets?

          Barton walks out of the restroom. Looks at Cap.

                          CLINT BARTON

           I can.

          Steve looks at Natasha and she nods her head to confirm Barton's

          on their side.

                          STEVE

           You got a suit?

                          CLINT BARTON

           Yeah.

                          STEVE

           Then suit up.

                         MONTAGE

          - KRAKAKABOOM! A blinding BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from

          above, colliding on MJOLNIR. The explosion is massive. THE

          MIGHTY THOR.

          - CAPTAIN AMERICA pulls on his HELMET and SHIELD.

          - Tony WELDS his IRON MAN helmet. LIGHT slips down over IRON

          MAN's eye holes.

          - BLACK WIDOW attaches a GLOVE GAUNTLET with her rounds on her

          wrist. A BLUE LIGHT CHARGES.

          - HAWKEYE slips on his QUIVER of arrows.

          EXT/INT. QUINJET  DAY

          Cap, Widow and Hawkeye walk towards and into the QUINJET. A

          YOUNG SHIELD PILOT looks and stands in their way.

           YOUNG SHIELD PILOT

           You are not authorized to be here...

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           Son... just don't.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

          Fury looks the window of the ship, contemplating. Agent Hill

          walks up to him, knowing.

           AGENT MARIA HILL

           Sir.

                          NICK FURY

           Agent Hill?

           AGENT MARIA HILL

           Those cards, they were in Coulson's

           locker, not in his jacket.

                          NICK FURY

           They needed the push.

           (holding Coulson's cards)

          A LOUD NOISE SCREECHES. Fury looks out to see IRON MAN flying

          off as well as the QUINJET.

                          NICK FURY

           They found it. Get our communications

           back up, whatever you have to do. I

           want eyes on everything.

           AGENT MARIA HILL

           Yes, sir.

          EXT. NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE - STARK TOWER  DAY

          IRON MAN arrives at STARK TOWER where Selvig, ACTIVATES the CMS

          device, holding the Tesseract.

                          JARVIS

           Sir, I took off the arc reactor. The

           device is already self-sustained.

                          TONY

           Shut it down, Dr. Selvig.

                          SELVIG

           It's too late! It can't stop now. He

           wants to show us something! A new

           universe.

                          IRON MAN

           Okay.

          IRON MAN aims his hands toward the CMS and FIRES. The energy

          from his boosters SHATTERS with a deafening CRACK! Selvig falls

          backwards. DOWN BELOW, CITIZENS OF NEW YORK look up at STARK

          TOWER. IRON MAN stares in disbelief at the CMS ... unharmed.

                          JARVIS

           The barrier is pure energy. It's

           unbreachable. The Mark VII is not ready

           to be deployed.

                          TONY

           Skip the spinning rims. We're on the

           clock.

          TONY lands his SUIT and goes through the gauntlet and unsuits

          him. LOKI looks up at him, smiling. They proceed to walk into

          the penthouse.

          INT. STARK PENTHOUSE  DAY

          Loki walks in, holding the scepter. Tony casually walks down the

          steps, towards the bar.

                          LOKI

           Please tell me you're going to appeal

           to my humanity.

                          TONY

           Uh...actually, I'm planning to threaten

           you.

                          LOKI

           You should have left your armor on for

           that.

                          TONY

           Yeah, it's seen a bit of mileage.

           You've got the blue stick of destiny.

           Would you like a drink?

                          LOKI

           Stalling me won't change anything.

                          TONY

           No, no, no! Threatening. No drink? You

           sure? I'm having one.

                          LOKI

           The CHITAURI are coming, nothing will

           change that. What have I to fear?

                          TONY

           THE AVENGERS.

           (Loki looks at him, confused)

           It's what we call ourselves, sort of

           like a team. `EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES'

           type of thing.

                          LOKI

           Yes, I've met them.

                          TONY

                          (SMILING)

           Yeah, takes us a while to get any

           traction, I'll give you that one.

                          TONY (CONT'D)

           But, let's do a head count here. Your

           brother, the demi-God; a super soldier,

           a living legend who kind of lives up to

           the legend; a man with breath-taking

           anger management issues; a couple of

           master assassins, and you, big fella,

           you've managed to piss off every single

           one of them.

                          LOKI

           That was the plan.

                          TONY

           Not a great plan. When they come, and

           they will, they'll come for you.

          From underneath the bar table, Tony pulls on COLANTOTTE

          BRACELETS, a honing device.

                          LOKI

           I have an army.

                          TONY

           We have a HULK.

                          LOKI

           I thought the beast had wandered off.

                          TONY

           You're missing the point. There's no

           throne, there is no version of this,

           where you come out on top. Maybe your

           army comes and maybe it's too much for

           us, but it's all on you. Because if we

           can't protect the Earth, you can be

           damned well sure we'll avenge it.

                          LOKI

           (slowly walks up to him;

           raising the scepter)

           How will your friends have time for

           me,when they're so busy fighting you?

          Loki TAPS Tony on the chest with his scepter. PING! Nothing.

          Confused, Loki tires again. PING! NOTHING.

                          LOKI

           It should work.

                          TONY

           Well, performance issues. You know?

          In anger, Loki GRABS Tony by the throat and FLINGS him across

          the room.

                          TONY

           Jarvis. Anytime now.

          Loki grabs Tony by the throat again.

                          LOKI

           You will all fall before me.

          LOKI THROWS TONY OUT THE WINDOW. Tony FREEFALLS down the tower.

          From behind Loki, an elevator opens and a RED POD SHOOTS out.

          The pod LASER SIGNALS the COLANTOTTE BRACELETS on Tony. The POD

          begins to TRANSFORM into the MARK VII suit.

          It LATCHES onto Tony. IRON MAN. The suit FLIES up before he hits

          the ground or the gazing people. Loki looks up, angry.

                          IRON MAN

           And there's one other person you pissed

           off! His name was Phil.

          Loki raises the scepter. IRON MAN FIRES at Loki, sending him on

          his ass.

          EXT. STARK TOWER  DAY

          Selvig looks up at the sky. The Tesseract's energy BEAMS into

          the sky. The beam then forms a VORTEX, which then opens up

          ANOTHER PORTAL.

          EXT. VASTNESS OF SPACE

          A hole in space rips open, and from it, the CHITAURI ARMY SPILLS

          out in FLYING CHARIOTS, carrying ENERGY RIFLES with a bayonet on

          the end.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY

           Right. Army.

          IRON MAN flies up towards the portal. From his shoulders, a

          miniature multiple rocket launcher, pops out and FIRES. Like the

          JERICHO MISSILE, several targets are taken down unlike no

          missile. It's useless. THOUSANDS OF CHITAURI FLY OUT. IRON MAN

          flies towards the city.

          EXT. MANHATTAN  DAY

          The CHITAURI UNLEASH. New Yorkers fill the streets, staring at

          the fire fight in the distance. BOOM!!! The CHITAURI unleashes

          BLASTS as it goes, blowing up cars, setting storefronts aflame.

          AN EXPLOSION RIPS OUT THE WINDOWS OF THE TOP CORNER OF

          BUILDINGS. FLAME AND STONE RAIN DOWN. A DOMINO-EFFECT OF

          EXPLOSIONS RIPPLING ACROSS THE BRIDGE.

          EXT. STARK TOWER  DAY

          Loki walks onto the balcony as the SOUNDS of the CHITAURI rings

          out. He admires his soon to be kingdom. THOR LANDS ON THE TOWER.

          Loki turns to his ENEMY.

                          THOR

           Loki! Turn off the Tesseract or I'll

           destroy it!

                          LOKI

           You can't. There is no stopping it.

           There is only the war!

                          THOR

           So be it.

          Loki and Thor rush at each other. They and their weapons

          collide. The two battle -- Loki unleashing another pent-up rage

          and jealousy, Thor having no choice but to defend himself.

          EXT. MANHATTAN  DAY

          SOLDIERS AND COPS have taken positions covering the streets.

          They see from the sky, IRON MAN leading a trail of CHITAURI

          towards his tower.

          EXT. SKY  DAY

          The QUINJET BOOMS into the city.

           BLACK WIDOW (V.O.)

           Stark, we're heading north east.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          IRON MAN

           What, did you stop for drive-thru?

           Swing up PARK, I'm gonna lay 'em out

           for you.

          EXT. STARK TOWER  DAY

          IRON MAN BANKS around his tower. Sees Thor and Loki still going

          at it. IRON MAN SWOOPS down the street, causing a CHITAURI to

          crash.

          Flying up, IRON MAN puts the following CHITAURI in view of the

          QUINJET. BLACK WIDOW takes out machine gun and FIRES at the

          CHITAURI.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          JARVIS

           Sir, we have more incoming.

                          TONY

           Fine. Let's keep them occupied.

          IRON MAN heads back to the portal.

          EXT. STARK TOWER  DAY

          Thor and Loki battle savagely. Loki fires ENERGY from the

          scepter, sending Thor sliding across the floor.

          INT. QUINJET  DAY

          HAWKEYE looks out to his left window, finding a target.

                          HAWKEYE

           Yeah.

                          BLACK WIDOW

           See them.

          HAWKEYE BANKS the jet towards STARK TOWER. Aims the MINIGUN at

          Loki. Loki AIMS the scepter at the QUINJET and FIRES A BLAST OF

          ENERGY. Thor gets to his feet, TACKLING Loki down hard.

          THE QUINJET is soon caught on fire. HAWKEYE maneuvers one wing

          of the jet. They SPIN and SLOW. DROPPING OUT OF THE AIR AS IT

          PASSES OVER SKYSCRAPERS. Then... they SLAM into the street.

          INT. QUINJET  DAY

          With everyone okay, HAWKEYE and BLACK WIDOW unfasten their

          seatbelts and open the ramp. CAPTAIN AMERICA runs down, followed

          by HAWKEYE and BLACK WIDOW. Each one has their respected weapons

          in hand.

          EXT. FOUR WAY STREET  DAY

          The TRIO arrives in the middle of a four-way street. Suddenly,

          the city LURCHES to a stop. A DEEP, PRIMAL RAGE BELLOWS OUT.

          With that roar, a SHADOW comes over them.

          EXT. VASTNESS OF SPACE

          From the portal, a FUCKING CHITAURI LEVIATHAN FLIES OUT!

          Carrying hundreds of SOLDIERS, the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN PASSES

          OVER the TRIO.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET  DAY

          They look up, out of their element. From both sides, CHITAURI

          SOLDIERS CLING OFF and attach themselves to the sides of the

          buildings, sliding down. Some CRASH into these buildings and

          begin FIRING from their ENERGY RIFLES at innocent people.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           Stark, are you seeing this?

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY

           I'm seeing, still working on believing.

           Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet?

           CAPTAIN AMERICA (V.O.)

           Banner?

                          TONY

           Just keep me posted. Jarvis, find me a

           soft spot.

          IRON MAN quietly flies behind and parallel with the CHITAURI

          LEVIATHAN.

          EXT. STARK TOWER  DAY

          Thor holds down Loki's face straight ahead, forcing him to watch

          the city falling to ash.

                          THOR

           Look at this! Look around you! You

           think this madness will end with your

           rule?

                          LOKI

           (tries to look away)

           It's too late. It's too late to stopit.

                          THOR

           No. We can. Together.

          Loki looks at his brother, showing a sign of hope. Then... Loki

          stabs Thor with a small knife. Thor keels over.

                          LOKI

           Sentiment.

          Thor gets up, KICKS Loki and lifts him into the air. Thor then

          SLAMS him down, hard. Loki, bleeding, rolls over the edge. Thor

          looks down. LOKI IS RIDING ON A FLYING CHARIOT. DOZENS of

          CHITAURI follow his lead.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET  DAY

          The TRIO runs behind upside taxis. They look up and see Loki

          taking his band down the street and FIRES at the street IN A

          CHAIN OF EXPLOSIONS. SMASHING CARS AND HURLING PEOPLE AS IT GOES

          IT GOES OFF IN ONE FINAL CONFLAGRATION.

          TERRIFIED PEOPLE running from Loki, looking over their

          shoulders, coming straight at us. CAPTAIN AMERICA looks down the

          bridge.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           Those people need assistance down

           there.

          CHITAURI SOLDIERS that have landed near them and begin FIRING at

          them. BLACK WIDOW pulls both pistols and FIRES. Turns to Cap.

                          BLACK WIDOW

           We got this. It's good. Go!

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

                          (AT HAWKEYE)

           You think you can hold them off?

                          HAWKEYE

           Captain.

           (pulls a trigger on his bow;

           a narrow is mechanically

                          CHOSEN)

           It would be my genuine pleasure.

          HAWKEYE shoots an ARROW into the creature's head, gaining a few

          seconds for CAPTAIN AMERICA as he falls down the bridge,

          followed by an EXPLOSION.

          Cap races over to the plaza, jumping over dozens of EXPLODING

          cars. THE FIRST AVENGER RUNS LIKE A FUCKING CHEETAH.

          HAWKEYE runs over a bus full of people. From the windows, SMALL

          CHILDREN are held by their parents for HAWKEYE to pull them out

          to safety. He runs over to the jammed door and JERKILY opens it.

          People begin to run out.

          BLACK WIDOW empties out her CLIPS. HAWKEYE fires ARROWS into the

          ranks of the CHITAURI, hitting his mark each time he shoots.

                          BLACK WIDOW

           Just like BUDAPEST all over again!

                          HAWKEYE

           You and I remember Budapest

           verydifferently.

          EXT. MANHATTAN  DAY

          The COPS continuously fire at the flying chariots. It's pretty

          pointless. A YOUNG COP runs over to his POLICE SERGEANT.

                          YOUNG COP

           We need to get out! They gotta bring

           the National Guard!

                          POLICE SERGEANT

           National Guard? Does the army know

           what's happening here?

                          YOUNG COP

           Do we?

          CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps in front of them. They look up at this

          ridiculous looking man.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           I need men in these buildings. There

           are people inside that can run into the

           line of fire. You take them through the

           basement or through the subway. You

           keep them off the streets. I need a

           perimeter as far back as 39th.

                          POLICE SERGEANT

           Why the hell should I take orders from

           you?

          Suddenly, an EXPLOSION comes up from behind Cap. An ENERGY BLAST

          is blocked by his SHIELD. TWO CHITAURI SOLDIERS attack. The cops

          watch in shock as CAPTAIN AMERICA FIGHTS them off with ease. The

          Sergeant turns to his officer.

                          POLICE SERGEANT

           I need men in those buildings, lead the

           people down and away from the streets.

           I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.

          EXT. SKY LINE  DAY

          IRON MAN swerves around a building and faces the CHITAURI

          LEVIATHAN. He pulls out his miniature multiple rocket launcher

          and FIRES. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN ROARS in annoyance. The

          CHITAURI LEVIATHAN turns to him.

                          IRON MAN

                          (TO JARVIS)

           We got his attention. What the hell is

           step two?!

          IRON MAN flies away.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET  DAY

          HAWKEYE TRIPS a CHITAURI SOLDIER and RAMS an arrow down its

          throat. BLACK WIDOW gets her hands on an ENERGY RIFLE and

          STICKFIGHTS the hell out of them.

          CAPTAIN AMERICA joins back in and using his SHIELD, SWAPS and

          WHACKS oncoming CHITAURI SOLDIERS. It's all too much on them,

          until...

          Lightning strikes down from the sky, channeling the blast,

          firing the electricity out at the CHITAURI SOLDIERS around them.

          They're blasted back in a massive shockwave. The CHITAURI

          SOLDIERS convulse, drop dead to the ground. THOR TOUCHES DOWN.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           What's the story upstairs?

                          THOR

           The powers surrounding the cube is

           impenetrable.

           IRON MAN (V.O.)

           Thor is right. We gotta deal with these

           guys.

                          BLACK WIDOW

           How do we do this?

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           As a team.

                          THOR

           I have unfinished business with Loki.

                          HAWKEYE

           Yeah, get in line.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           Save it. Loki's gonna keep this fight

           focused on us and that's what we need.

           Without him these things could run

           wild. We got Stark up top, he's gonna

           need us...

          Just then, BANNER ARRIVES ON A SMALL MOTORBIKE. Getting off, he

          looks around the city.

                          BANNER

           So, this all seems horrible.

                          BLACK WIDOW

           I've seen worse.

                          BANNER

           Sorry.

                          BLACK WIDOW

           No. We could use a little worse.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           Stark? We got him.

           IRON MAN (V.O.)

           Banner?

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           Just like you said.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY

           Then tell him to suit up. I'm bringing

           the party to you.

          IRON MAN comes out from behind a building. The CHITAURI

          LEVIATHAN follows, impatiently.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET  DAY

          The rest of the AVENGERS look up, getting ready and standing

          still.

                          BLACK WIDOW

           I... I don't see how that's a party...

          IRON MAN SWOOPS down the street. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN also

          swoops down, BARRELING down the street like a FREIGHT TRAIN that

          keeps building and building its intensity.Banner looks behind.

          Cap looks at him. Banner begins to walk towards the monster.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           Dr. Banner. Now might be a really good

           time for you to get angry.

                          BANNER

           That's my secret, Captain. I'm always

           angry.

          Banner's body starts to swell and stretch and harden. GREEN

          SHOOTS THROUGH HIS BODY. THE HULK.

          Aaaannndddd.........SSSMMMAAASSSHHH!!!! HULK POPS the CHITAURI

          LEVIATHAN IN THE NOSE. THE CREATURE FLIPS OVER A 360.

          IRON MAN, in mid-flight, extends his arm out and a ROCKET, ready

          to shoot. IRON MAN FIRES -- the rocket hits a SOFT SPOT  LARGE

          CHITAURI LEVIATHAN are BLOWN COMPLETELY AWAY. Real pain from the

          CHITAURI LEVIATHAN. Other pieces of meat CATCH FIRE and

          withdraw... SIZZLE as they hit the pavement. CAPTAIN AMERICA

          raises his SHIELD to block them.

          From above and on the buildings, the CHITAURI ARMY watches in

          horror as a group of EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES FIND THEMSELVES

          UNITED AGAINST A COMMON THREAT. TO FIGHT THE FOES NO SINGLE

          SUPER HERO COULD WITHSTAND! THE AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!

          EXT. SKY  DAY

          Loki watches below, motionless.

                          LOKI

           Send the rest.

          EXT. VASTNESS OF SPACE

          From the portal, THOUSANDS MORE OF CHITAURI SOLDIERS AND EVEN

          MORE CHITAURI LEVIATHANS FLY OUT!

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET  DAY

          THE AVENGERS look up. Way out of their fucking element.

                          BLACK WIDOW

           Guys.

                          IRON MAN

           Call it, Cap.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           Alright, listen up. Until we can close

           that portal up there, we're gonna use

           containment. Barton, I want you on that

           roof, eyes on everything. Call out

           patterns and strays. Stark, you got the

           perimeter. Anything gets more than

           three blocks out, you turn it back or

           your turn it to ash.

                          HAWKEYE

           Wanna give me a lift?

                          IRON MAN

           Right. Better clench up, LEGOLAS.

          IRON MAN lifts HAWKEYE up to the building.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           Thor, you've gotta try and bottleneck

           that portal. Slow them down. You've got

           the lightning. Light the bastards up.

           (Thor flies up; to Natasha)

           You and me, we stay here on the ground,

           keep the fighting here. And Hulk.SMASH.

          THE HULK SMILES A MOST MAGNIFICENT GRIN AND LEAPS, SOARING HIGH

          UP INTO THE NEAREST BUILDING, HULK RUNS UP THE WALL HITS SEVERAL

          CHITAURI SOLDIERS, SNAPPING IN HALF.

          HE DIVES TOWARDS A BUILDING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET,

          THROWING THE DEAD CHITAURI SOLDIERS TOWARDS OTHER SOLDIERS. The

          CHITAURI SOLDIERS fire at him. THE HULK BACKHANDS THEM, SEIZES

          THEM AND WITH RAW POWER, THROWS THEM DOWN.

          IN HIS MOST POWERFUL LEAP YET, THE HULK FLIES UP AND IS IN THE

          MIDDLE OF A FLYING CHARIOT TRAFFIC JAM, TO WHICH HE SMACKS THEM

          OUT OF ALTITUDE.

          EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING  DAY

          Thor grabs onto the tower. Raises MJOLNIR and KRAKAKABOOM! A

          BLINDING BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from above, colliding on

          MJOLNIR. THOR AIMS THIS MASSIVE SHOCKWAVE TOWARDS THE PORTAL.

          THOR CHANNELS THE BLAST AND FIRES THE ELECTRICITY OUT AT THE

          CHITAURI SOLDIERS FLYING OUT OF THE PORTAL. THEY'RE BLASTED BACK

          IN A MASSIVE SHOCKWAVE. THE CHITAURI SOLDIERS CONVULSE, DROP

          DEAD TO THE GROUND. HE EVEN RIPS THE SHIT OUT OF A CHITAURI

          LEVIATHAN, WHICH THEN FUCKING EXPLODES.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

          Back in the bridge, Fury sees on his VIEWSCREEN the destruction

          going on in NEW YORK. Agent Hill walks up to him.

           AGENT MARIA HILL

           Sir. The council is on.

          OH SHIT. Fury presses his screen.

          EXT. ROOFTOP BUILDING  DAY

          Atop the rooftop, HAWKEYE fires ARROWS into the streaming flow

          of the CHITAURI RIDERS, hitting his mark each time. Hell, heeven

          AIMS his bow behind him, WITHOUT LOOKING and releases the arrow,

          EXPLODING a RIDER.

                          HAWKEYE

           Stark. You got a lot of strings

           sticking to your tail.

                          IRON MAN

           Just try and keep them off the streets.

                          HAWKEYE

           Well, they can't bank worth a damn.

           Find a tight corner.

                          IRON MAN

           I will roger that.

          IRON MAN does so and leads towards TIGHT CORNERS and in

          HAWKEYE'S view, who fires arrow upon and arrow, EXPLODING the

          CHITAURI RIDERS. IRON MAN keeps leading CHITAURI RIDERS UNDER

          TUNNELS, THROUGH OPEN PARKING GARAGES. He looks back. None left.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY

           Nice call. What else you got?

           HAWKEYE (V.O.)

           Well, Thor's taking on a squadron down

           on 6th.

                          TONY

           And he didn't invite me?

          EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM  DAY

          We are looking INTO a conference room where office workers sit

          around a table. But the NOISE has caught one worker's eye, then

          another, and soon they are all rising, stepping to the window,

          mesmerized by what lies beyond.

          WORKERS' POVA CHITAURI LEVIATHAN SWIMS right in front of them.

          EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM  DAY

          Suddenly, another NOISE catches the worker's attention. THE HULK

          CRASHES THROUGH THEIR FLOOR. SLASHES HIS THROUGH THE ROOM,

          POUNDING AWAY AND JUMPS OUT ONTO THE JAW OF THE CHITAURI

          LEVIATHAN. THE CHITAURI LEVIATHAN BEGINS TO HEAD DOWN, TRYING TO

          WAVE OFF THE HULK.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET  DAY

          BLACK WIDOW, using the ENERGY RIFLE, is taken off her feet by a

          CHITAURI SOLDIER. She TIRESOMELY takes it down by cutting its

          throat. She grabs the ENERGY RIFLE, turns to attack. Cap stands

          there, holding his SHIELD. She slumps back, tired.

                          BLACK WIDOW

           Captain, none of this is gonna mean a

           damn thing if we don't close that

           portal.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.

                          BLACK WIDOW

           Well, maybe it's not about guns.

           (gestures the flying

                          CHARIOTS)

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           You wanna get up there, you're gonna

           need a ride.

                          BLACK WIDOW

           I got a ride. I could use a lift

           though.

          BLACK WIDOW backs up giving herself a running start. Cap lifts

          and angles his SHIELD.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           Are you sure about this?

                          BLACK WIDOW

           Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

          BLACK WIDOW RUNS AT CAPTAIN AMERICA. BLACK WIDOW DOES A PARKOUR

          MOVE, USING HER FEET TO RUN UP THE CAR AND JUMPS UP ON CAP'S

          SHIELD, WHO GIVES HER A BOOST WITH THE SHIELD. SHE GRABS ONTO A

          FLYING CHARIOT.

          [Note: The following sequence will take us through the action in

          one extended shot.]

          - BLACK WIDOW climbs onto the chariot and CUTS the turret

          shooter's linkage to it. She then JUMPS on the rider and STICKS

          her knives into his nervous system. She gets him to BANK over a

          building.

          - IRON MAN arrives and SHOOTS any other CHITAURI RIDERS

          following her. He makes his way down to CAPTAIN AMERICA, who

          fights off more CHITAURI SOLDIERS. IRON MAN points his HAND

          BOOSTERS at his SHIELD. The energy comes off and Cap uses it as

          a REFLECTION BEAM and takes down nearby CHITAURI.

          - From above them, HAWKEYE sends down remaining arrows. He sends

          one across the street, taking down a CHITAURI RIDER following

          IRON MAN.

          - Finally, we have THOR and HULK fight on top the back of the

          CHITAURI LEVIATHAN, tearing apart and fighting SOLDIERS. HULK

          BREAKS OFF A MASSIVE PIECE OF ARMOR AND SLAMS IT DOWN ONTO THE

          SPINE OF THE CHITAURI LEVIATHAN. Summoning all his strength he,

          THOR RAISES, DRAWING LIGHTNING TO IT FROM ALL SIDES, AND BRINGS

          IT DOWN WITH A FINAL, TERRIBLE BLOW--

          INT. HISTORY MUSEUM  DAY

          The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN CRASHES into a history museum. DEAD. THOR

          and HULK stand on the BACK of the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN after

          bringing it down. They stand still, admiring. HULK PUNCHES THOR

          WITH HIS ENORMOUS HAND. THOR GOES FLYING. HULK SMIRKS.

          EXT. STARK TOWER  DAY

          SELVIG WAKES UP FROM LOKI MIND CONTROL. He looks around,

          confused where he is. He looks up at the sky, amazed.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET  DAY

          Several HUMVEES aim their MOUNTED .50 Cal guns into the sky,

          FIRING and HITTING CHITAURI RIDERS. CAPTAIN AMERICA fights off a

          SOLDIER who is pinning him down with its energy rifle. Cap

          BREAKS ITS LEG. He stands up, pickingup his SHILED.

                          HAWKEYE

           Captain, the bank on 42ndpast MADISON,

           they caught a lot of civilians there.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           I'm on it.

          INT. 42NDBANK  DAY

          Dozens of civilians are gathered in bank. Tension and

          uncertainty surround them. THREE CHITAURI SOLDIERS oversee them,

          pointing their weapons at them. One of them charges a BOMB. It

          BEEPS.

          CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps through the window and throws his SHIELD

          at the CHITAURI BOMBER. The TWO CHITAURI SOLDIERS aim their

          rifles, but Cap heads for cover under a desk, which he KICKS at

          them.

          CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps over the desk, HEADLOCKS A SOLDIER, while

          BACKHANDING another one over the railing. The crowd moves away.

          A CHITAURI SOLDIER attacks him from behind and RIPS OFF HIS

          HELMET. The bomb is beeping faster.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           Everyone! Clear out!

          CAPTAIN AMERICA flips over the SOLDIER, grabs his SHIELD and

          just as the BOMB is about to GO OFF, CHITAURI BOMBER dives for,

          trying to stop it, but it GOES OFF, sending CAPTAIN AMERICA

          through the window, landing very hard on a car. The civilians

          look up from below. They're okay.

          EXT. OUTSIDE THE BANK  CONTINUOUS

          Cap gets off the car, looks around the city. Destroyed. The

          police and firemen arrive, pulling out those civilians he saved.

          A WAITRESS looks back, thankful.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

          Back in the bridge, Fury sees on his VIEWSCREEN the WORLD

          SECURITY COUNCIL.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2

           Director Fury, the council has made a

           decision.

                          NICK FURY

           I recognize the council has made a

           decision, but given that it's a stupid

           ass decision, I've elected to ignore

           it.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1

           Director, you're closer than any of

           oursubs, you scramble that jet...

                          NICK FURY

           That is the island of Manhattan,

           Councilman. Until I'm certain my team

           can't hold it, I will not order a

           nuclear strike against a civilian

           population.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1

           If we don't hold them in the air, we

           lose everything.

                          NICK FURY

           I send that bird out, we already have.

          Fury shuts off his viewscreen.

          EXT. MANHATTAN  DAY

          BLACK WIDOW, still driving the chariot with the RIDER, is hit at

          her side. She looks about, wondering whose ENERGY FIRE it was

          she looks behind.

                          BLACK WIDOW

           Oh. You.

          LOKI FOLLOWS IN HOT PURSUIT. They RACE DOWNWARD, trailing

          between buildings. They RACE MADLY, driving and dodging.

          EXT. ROOFTOP BUILDING  DAY

          HAWKEYE looks at BLACK WIDOW, astonished.

                          HAWKEYE

           Nat, what are you doing?

           BLACK WIDOW (V.O.)

           Uh... a little help!

          HAWKEYE pulls the trigger twice, nocks an arrow, and points it

          at Loki, smiling.

                          HAWKEYE

           I've got him.

          FIRES. THE ARROW STREAKS DOWN THE CITY, STRAIGHT AT THE LOKI'S

          HEAD...

          SNATCH! LIKE A CAT, LOKI GRABS THE ARROW STRAIGHT OUT OF THE

          AIR...LOOKS STRAIGHT AT HAWKEYE, SMILING...

          BBOOOOMMM!!! THE ARROW EXPLODES IN LOKI'S FACE, CRASHING INTO

          THE STARK PENTHOUSE PAD.

          BLACK WIDOW looks down and building her momentum, she JUMPS of

          the chariot, lands on top of STARK TOWER, rolling herself to the

          edge.

          EXT/INT. STARK PENTHOUSE  DAY

          As Loki looks up, shocked at what just happened, THE HULK IS

          LEAPING UP AND KICKS LOKI, HURTLING TOWARDS THE GLASS WINDOW. He

          COLLAPSES as he hits the wall. THE HULK jumps in, ready to

          attack. Loki ROLLS himself up in a flurry of broken glass,

          STANDING UP TO THE HULK.

                          LOKI

           ENOUGH! YOU ARE, ALL OF YOU ARE BENEATH

           ME! I AM A GOD, YOU DULL CREATURE, AND

           I WILL NOT BE BULLIED...

          HULK GRABS LOKI BY THE LEGS AND SMASHES HIM AGAINST THE FLOOR

          REPEATEDLY AND FINALLY THROWS HIM ASIDE TO THE GROUND,

          FLATTENING LOKI.

                          HULK

           PUNY GOD.

          LOKI WHIMPERS IN PAIN.

          EXT. STARK TOWER  DAY

          BLACK WIDOW walks up the CMS machine. Selvig, slumped down,

          weakened, looks at her desperately. The Tesseract's energy is

          firing towards the portal, gaining in strength, at the surge of

          energy moving through the sky.

                          BLACK WIDOW

           Doctor.

                          SELVIG

           Loki's scepter, the energy...the

           Tesseract can't fight. You can't

           protect against yourself.

                          BLACK WIDOW

           It's not your fault. You didn't know

           what you were doing.

                          SELVIG

           Well, actually I think I did. I built

           in a safety to cut the power source.

                          BLACK WIDOW

           Loki's scepter.

                          SELVIG

           It might be able to close the portal.

           (Selvig looks down. He sees a

                          GOLD GLEAM)

           And I'm looking right at it.

          EXT. MANHATTAN  DAY

          THOR rides on top of chariot, SMACKING SEVERAL RIDERS with the

          hammer. As Thor takes the reins, a CHITAURI LEVIATHAN crashes

          through a building, knocking him down to where Cap is, fighting

          off SOLDIERS.

          IRON MAN flies right next to the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN and aims his

          LASER BOOSTER at it. Nothing.

                          JARVIS

           Sir, we will lose power before you cut

           through that shell.

          IRON MAN flies up ahead, facing the oncoming monster.

                          IRON MAN

           JARVIS. You ever hear the tale of

           Jonah?

                          JARVIS

           I wouldn't consider him a role model.

          IRON MAN FLIES TOWARDS THE CHITAURI LEVIATHAN, UNLEASHING EVERY

          ARSENAL ON THE SUIT. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN opens its mouth.

          IRON MAN flies in and BURSTS out the other end, making the

          CHITAURI LEVIATHAN collapse. IRON MAN rolls down the street. The

          wind is knocked out of him. He looks up with an overwhelming

          sigh as a SMALL BAND of CHITAURI SOLDIERS rush towards him,

          holding out their rifles.

          EXT. ROOFTOP BUILDING  DAY

          HAWKEYE turns to fire HIS LAST ARROW. Using his bow as a staff,

          he knocks some CHITAURI SOLDIERS, before yanking his last arrow

          off the dead body a CHITAURI SOLDIERS.

          HAWKEYE nocks his arrow, DIVES DOWN THE BUILDING and FIRES his

          GRAPPLING ARROW up into the side of building. Falling down,

          HAWKEYE finds the MOMENTUM and SWINGS himself into a building

          and CANNONBALLS in.

          EXT. MANHATTAN  DAY

          The HULK holds CHITAURI SOLDIERS by the face and SLAMS them

          down. More keep coming. HULK looks up. HUNDREDS OF RIDERS HOVER

          OVER HIM. Then... they begin to fire ENERGY BLASTS. HULK TAKES

          THEM LIKE HE'S RUNNING THROUGH A LIGHT RAIN. BLOCKING THE STREAM

          OF STREAKING BLASTS, AS THOUGH SWATTING AT BEES.

          EXT. HELICARRIER DECK  DAY

          A lone pilot sits in his cockpit, listening.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2

           DIRECTOR FURY is no longer in command.

           Override order, 7 ALPHA 11.

                          7 ALPHA 11 PILOT

           7 ALPHA 11, confirmed. Prepare to

           takeoff.

          He ignites his engine.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

          Back in the bridge, Agent Hill sees on her SCREEN 7 ALPHA 11

          preparing to leave.

           AGENT MARIA HILL

           Sir, we have a bird in motion! Anyone

           on the deck, we have a rogue bird! We

           need to shut it down! Repeat! Take off

           is not authorized!

          EXT. HELICARRIER DECK  DAY

          NICK FURY RUNS OUT TO THE DECK, HOLDING A FUCKING AIRTRONIC RPG-

          7. He takes AIM and FIRES, HITTING the TAIL END of the jet. The

          jet SKIDS OFF towards the edge. PILOT UNHARMED.

          Suddenly, another 7 ALPHA 11 JET FLIES off. Fury stands there,

          knowing he can't do anything about it.

                          NICK FURY

           Stark, you hearing me? We have a

           missile headed straight for the city.

           IRON MAN (V.O.)

           How long?

                          NICK FURY

           Three minutes, at best. Stay low and

           wipe out the missile.

          EXT. MANHATTAN  DAY

          IRON MAN fights off as many CHITAURI SOLDIERS as he sustain.

                          IRON MAN

           Jarvis, put everything we got into the

           thrusters!

                          JARVIS

           I just did.

          IRON MAN leaves the streets and flies up into the sky.

          EXT. SKY  DAY

          7 ALPHA 11 arrives outside the city. He flips the switch to

          press the button. He presses it. THE MISSILE IS FLYING OUT TO

          MANHATTAN.

                          7 ALPHA 11

           Destination is in 2 minutes, 30 seconds

           mark.

          EXT. MANHATTAN  DAY

          CAPTAIN AMERICA AND THOR BATTLE, SIDE TO SIDE. Cap and Thor both

          throw their respected weapons. Thor catches MJOLNIR, but as Cap

          turns, an ENERGY BLAST strikes him down hard. Thor runs over to

          a broken car, swings the hammer and flips the car over and over

          on its side, crushing a few CHITAURI SOLDIERS.

          Cap tries to get up. Thor helps him back to his feet. Cap raises

          his SHIELD back up.

                          THOR

           You ready for another bout?

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           What? You gettin' sleepy?

          EXT. STARK TOWER  DAY

          Selvig, back in scientist mode, CLACKS away at his laptop.

          Henods. BLACK WIDOW grabs Loki's scepter, slowly breaks into the

          FORCE FIELD, almost touching the Tesseract.

                          BLACK WIDOW

           I can close it! Can anybody hear me? I

           can shut the portal down!

          EXT. MANHATTAN  DAY

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           Do it!

           IRON MAN (V.O.)

           No, wait!

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           Stark, these things are still coming!

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY

           I got a nuke coming in, it's gonna blow

           in less than a minute. And I know just

           where to put it.

          EXT. SKY  DAY

          IRON MAN catches up, now comes at the missile from behind. The

          missile speeds on. IRON MAN grabs it from behind, gripping it

          tightly.

          With a mighty effort, he wrenches the rocket off its course.

          Steering it from behind, he accelerates quickly, flying straight

          up into sky, towards the portal.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

           CAPTAIN AMERICA (V.O.)

           Stark, you know that's a one-way trip?

                          TONY

                          (TO JARVIS)

           Save the rest for return, J.

                          JARVIS

           Sir. Shall I call Miss Potts?

                          IRON MAN

           You might as well.

          INT. STARK JET  DAY

          PEPPER, along with her crew, watches on T.V., in horror, the

          destruction in NEW YORK. On the table, her cell is VIBRATING,

          with Tony's picture on it.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

          Back in the bridge, every single agent holds their breath as

          they too watch IRON MAN fly up into the portal.

          EXT. SKY  DAY

          IRON MAN climbs higher and higher over the city, gaining speed,

          suddenly flings himself through the portal. Communications die.

          The suit begins to freeze. Tony looks in horror.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

          Every single agent CHEERS. Fury smiles. He tries to communicate

          with Tony. NOTHING.

          EXT. SPACE

          We then see Tony's horror. AN ARMADA. The black sky is filled

          with what must be ninety ships in a vague cluster. Most of them

          hang still in the air. Some move swimmingly about.

          IRON MAN lets go of the missile. It whistles off into the

          blackness as IRON MAN IDLY falls back down the portal's opening.

          The missile reaches the MAIN SHIP. The MAIN SHIP IMPLODES,

          causing the entire ARMADA to burst into a supernova, creating a

          spectacular heavenly display.

          EXT. MANHATTAN  DAY

          Suddenly, all of the CHITAURI SOLDIERS and CHITAURI LEVIATHANS

          KEEL OVER and begin to SHAKE, then stop. They all fall over. THE

          AVENGERS look up at their CONSULTANT, not sure if he'll make it

          through.

          EXT. STARK TOWER  DAY

          Still holding the scepter in hand, BLACK WIDOW shifts around,

          waiting.

                          BLACK WIDOW

           Come on, Stark...

          EXT. MANHATTAN  DAY

          Thor and Cap see the supernova coming towards them. Thor nods to

          Cap.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           (to BLACK WIDOW)

           Close it.

          EXT. STARK TOWER  DAY

          Without hesitating, BLACK WIDOW pulls the scepter out, the

          TESSERACT turns off its energy beam. The PORTAL QUICKLY CLOSES.

          A SMALL FIGURE is hurled backwards into the open now closed

          portal. IRON MAN. Plummeting to the earth.

          EXT. MANHATTAN  DAY

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

                          (SMILING)

           Son of a gun!

          TIGHT ON IRON MAN: He keeps falling. And falling. And falling.

          EXT. MANHATTAN  DAY

                          THOR

           He's not slowing down.

          Thor swings Mjolnir around. Just as Thor flies up, THE HULK

          SNAGS IRON MAN OUT OF THE AIR, BOTH CRASHING AND SLIDING DOWN A

          BUILDING.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET  DAY

          HULK throws IRON MAN off him. Thor and Cap run over to him. Thor

          RIPS off Tony's helmet. He appears to be dead. They stand around

          not sure. Then... THE HULK YELLS IN FURY. THE NOISE STARTLES

          TONY AWAKE.

                          TONY

           What the hell? What just happened?

           Please tell me nobody kissed me?

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

                          (A BEAT)

           We won.

                          TONY

           Alright. Hey. Alright. Good job, guys.

           Let's just not come in tomorrow. Let's

           just take a day. Have you ever tried

           shawarma? There's a shawarma joint

           about two blocks from here. I don't

           know what it is, but I wanna try it.

                          THOR

           (looking up at Stark Tower)

           We're not finished yet.

          A beat.

                          TONY

           And then shawarma after.

          INT. STARK PENTHOUSE  DAY

          Loki crawls onto the stair, looking like a piece of shit rag

          doll. He takes a few breathers, senses someone is behind him. He

          turns TO FIND THE AVENGERS STARING AT HIM, PISSED.

                          LOKI

           If it's all the same to you. I'll have

           that drink.

          THE HULK SNORTS AT HIM.

          WEEKS LATER.

          INT. SHIELD ANALYTICAL ROOM  DAY

          In TV news montage about THE AVENGERS, we see various reports of

          what happened. Some people agree that the avengers did good,

          protecting the city. Others believe it was their cause.

           OLD MAN (STAN LEE)

           Superheroes? In New York? Give me a

           break!

                          SENATOR BOYNTON

           These so called heroes have to be held

           responsible for the destruction done to

           the city. This was their fight. Where

           are they now?

                          WAITRESS

           What? That this was somehow their

           fault? Captain America saved my life.

           Wherever he is, wherever any of them

           are, I just wanna say thank you.

          EXT. CENTRAL PARK  DAY

          The Avengers take Thor and Loki, who is handcuffed and muzzled,

          to a blocked area. Thor shakes hands with his team and gives

          Selvig a hug. Tony opens the Tesseract's case.

          Banner takes it out and places inside a glass tube, held by

          Thor. Thor gives Loki the other end, who reluctantly takes it.

          The Asgardians leap into the energy beam. GONE.

          Then, one-by-one, the group splinters off, strolling into

          different directions. Banner climbs in with Tony in his

          sportscar. Steve rides away in his Harley. Natasha and Clint

          climb back into SHIELD cars. They all part. For now.

          INT. SHIELD ANALYTICAL ROOM  DAY

          Fury is facing once more members of the WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL.

           Where are the Avengers?

                          NICK FURY

           I'm not currently tracking their

           whereabouts. I'd say they've earned a

           leave of absence.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2

           And the Tesseract?

                          NICK FURY

           The Tesseract is where it belongs: out

           of our reach.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1

           That's not your call.

                          NICK FURY

           I didn't make it. I just didn't argue

           with the god that did.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1

           So you let him take it and the war

           criminal, Loki, who should be answering

           for his crimes?

                          NICK FURY

           Oh, I think he will be.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1

           I don't think you understand what

           you've started. Letting the Avengers

           loose on this world. They're dangerous.

                          NICK FURY

           They surely are. And the whole world

           knows it. Every world knows it.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1

           Was that the point of all this? A

           statement?

                          NICK FURY

           A promise.

          Fury walks out, towards the bridge.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

          Fury and Agent Hill walk together, toward the window looking out

          into the world.

                         AGENT MARIA HILL

           Sir, how does it work now? They've gone

           their separate ways, some pretty

           extremely far. We get into a situation

           like this again, what happens then?

                          NICK FURY

           They'll come back.

           AGENT MARIA HILL

           You really sure about that?

                          NICK FURY

           I am.

           AGENT MARIA HILL

           Why?

                          NICK FURY

           Because we'll need them to.

          Agent Hill turns around. Fury looks out, smiling.

          INT. STARK PENTHOUSE  DAY

          TONY AND PEPPER UNVEIL A NEW DESIGN FOR STARK TOWER. CAMERA

          PULLS OUT, showing the letters for "STARK TOWER" have been blown

          away, and all that remains is a giant A.

                          THE END
