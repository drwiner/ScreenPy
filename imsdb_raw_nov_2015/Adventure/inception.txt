                                            SHOOTING SCRIPT

  FADE IN:

  DAWN. CRASHING SURF.

  The waves TOSS a BEARDED MAN onto wet sand. He lies there.

  A CHILD'S SHOUT makes him LIFT his head to see: a LITTLE

  BLONDE BOY crouching, back towards us, watching the tide eat

  a SANDCASTLE. A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL joins the boy. The Bearded

  Man tries to call them, but they RUN OFF, FACES UNSEEN. He

  COLLAPSES.

  The barrel of a rifle ROLLS the Bearded Man onto his back. A

  JAPANESE SECURITY GUARD looks down at him, then calls up the

  beach to a colleague leaning against a JEEP. Behind them is a

  cliff, and on top of that, a JAPANESE CASTLE.

  INT. ELEGANT DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - LATER

  The Security Guard waits as an ATTENDANT speaks to an ELDERLY

  JAPANESE MAN sitting at the dining table, back to us.

                     ATTENDANT

               (in Japanese)

           He was delirious. But he asked for

           you by name. And...

               (to the Security Guard)

           Show him.

                     SECURITY GUARD

               (in Japanese)

           He was carrying nothing but this...

  He puts a HANDGUN on the table. The Elderly Man keeps eating.

                     SECURITY GUARD

           ...and this.

  The Security Guard places a SMALL PEWTER CONE alongside the

  gun. The Elderly Man STOPS eating. Picks up the cone.

                     ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN

               (in Japanese)

           Bring him here. And some food.

  INT. SAME - MOMENTS LATER

  The Elderly Man watches the Bearded Man WOLF down his food.

  He SLIDES the handgun down the table towards him.

                     ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN

               (in English)

           Are you here to kill me?

  The Bearded Man glances up at him, then back to his food.

                                                          2.

  The Elderly Japanese Man picks up the cone between thumb and

  forefinger.

                    ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN

          I know what this is.

  He SPINS it onto a table- it CIRCLES gracefully across the

  polished ebony... a SPINNING TOP.

                    ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN

          I've seen one before. Many, many

          years ago...

  The Elderly Japanese Man STARES at the top mesmerized.

                    ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN

          It belonged to a man I met in a

          half-remembered dream...

  MOVE IN on the GRACEFULLY SPINNING TOP...

                     ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN

          A man possessed of some radical

          notions...

The Elderly Japanese Man STARES, remembering...

                    COBB (V.O.)

          What's the most resilient parasite?

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. SAME ELEGANT DINING ROOM - NIGHT (YEARS EARLIER)

The speaker, COBB, is 35, handsome, tailored. A young

Japanese man, SAITO, eats as he listens.

                    COBB

          A bacteria? A virus?

Cobb gestures at their feast with his wine glass-

                    COBB

          An intestinal worm?

Saito's fork pauses, mid-air. Cobb GRINS. A third man is at

the table- ARTHUR. He jumps in to save the pitch-

                    ARTHUR

          What Mr. Cobb is trying to say-

                     COBB

          An idea.

Saito looks at Cobb, curious.

                                                3.

                    COBB

          Resilient, highly contagious. Once

          an idea's taken hold in the brain

          it's almost impossible to

          eradicate. A person can cover it

          up, ignore it- but it stays there.

                    SAITO

          But surely-to forget...?

                    COBB

          Information, yes. But an idea?

          Fully formed, understood? That

          sticks...

              (taps forehead)

          In there, somewhere.

                    SAITO

          For someone like you to steal?

                    ARTHUR

          Yes. In the dream state, conscious

          defenses are lowered and your

          thoughts become vulnerable to

          theft. It's called extraction.

                    COBB

          But, Mr. Saito, we can train your

          subconscious to defend itself from

          even the most skilled extractor.

                    SAITO

          How can you do that?

                    COBB

          Because I am the most skilled

          extractor. I know how to search

          your mind and find your secrets. I

          know the tricks, and I can teach

          them to your subconscious so that

          even when you're asleep, your guard

          is never down.

Cobb leans forwards. Holding Saito's gaze.

                    COBB

          But if I'm going to help you, you

          have to be completely open to me.

          I'll need to know my way around

          your thoughts better than your

          wife, your analyst, anyone.

              (gestures around)

          If this is a dream and you've got a

          safe full of secrets, I need to

          know what's in that safe. For this

          to work, you have to let me in.

                                                            4.

Saito gives this a flicker of a smile. Rises. A BODYGUARD

opens double doors which give onto a LAVISH PARTY.

                    SAITO

          Gentlemen. Enjoy your evening as I

          consider your proposal.

They watch Saito leave. Arthur turns to Cobb, worried-

                      ARTHUR

          He knows.

Cobb motions silence. A TREMOR starts, they steady their

glasses, Cobb glances at his watch- THE SECOND HAND IS

FROZEN.

                    ARTHUR

          What's going on up there?

And we-

                                                    CUT TO:

FILTHY BATHROOM - DAY (FEELS LIKE DIFFERENT TIME)

Cobb, ASLEEP, SITTING IN A CHAIR AT THE END OF A STEAMING

BATH. The chair is up on a cabinet- the bottom of the legs

level with the rim of the tub.

A sweating man (40's) watches over Cobb. This is NASH. A

distant EXPLOSION rumbles through the room. Nash moves to the

window, parts the curtains. Outside: a CHAOTIC DEVELOPING-WORLD

CITY- the street filled with RIOTERS- SMASHING, BURNING.

Nash checks Cobb's left wrist: above his watch, tape holds

TWO THIN YELLOW TUBES in place. Nash looks at Cobb's watch-

THE SECOND HAND CRAWLS UNNATURALLY SLOWLY.

Nash follows the tubes to a SILVER BRIEFCASE at Arthur's

feet: ARTHUR IS ASLEEP in an armchair. Tubes connect the

briefcase to Arthur's wrist.

Nash follows another set of tubes from the briefcase to where

they pass under the door to the bedroom. Through the crack of

the door, Nash sees SAITO ASLEEP on the bed, tubes running to

his wrist. BOOM- a closer EXPLOSION, and we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY (FEELS LIKE DIFFERENT TIME)

Nash, ASLEEP. Head ROCKING AGAINST THE WINDOW as the train

BUMPS OVER A ROUGH PIECE OF TRACK.

                                                           5.

A Japanese Man, TODASHI (18) watches Nash nervously. He

checks Nash's wrist: TWO YELLOW TUBES CONNECT NASH WITH THREE

OTHER SLEEPING MEN IN THE COMPARTMENT: COBB, ARTHUR, SAITO.

Todashi checks his watch: THE SECOND HAND TICKS IN REAL TIME.

Another TRAIN PASSES in the opposite direction with a MIGHTY

WHUMP- Todashi's eyes FLY to Nash's sleeping face-

NASH JERKS WITH THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRAIN, and we-

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Another EXPLOSION- Nash CHECKS the sleeping Cobb and we-

                                                     CUT TO:

EXT. ROOFTOP TERRACES, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT

A LOW TREMOR RUMBLES THROUGH THE CASTLE. Cobb and Arthur

steady themselves against the wooden rail. Several TILES and

pieces of MASONRY fall. Below them a BLACK SEA churns. Other

GUESTS wander the massive terraces.

                    ARTHUR

          Saito knows. He's playing with us.

                    COBB

          I can get it here. The

          information's in the safe- he

          looked right at it when I mentioned

          secrets.

Arthur nods. Then spots someone over Cobb's shoulder.

                    ARTHUR

          What's she doing here, Cobb?

Cobb turns to see a beautiful woman, elegantly dressed,

staring out at the sea. This is MAL. Cobb watches her.

                    COBB

          You just get to your room. I'll

          take care of the rest.

                    ARTHUR

          See that you do. We're here to

          work.

Arthur brushes past Mal, shaking his head. She nears Cobb.

Looks out at the DROP. The WIND WHIPS HER HAIR-

                    MAL

          If I jumped, would I survive?

                                                           6.

                    COBB

          With a clean dive, perhaps. Mal,

          why are you here?

She turns to look at him. Amused.

                    MAL

          I thought you might be missing

          me...

She smiles. He leans in, mesmerized.

                    COBB

          I am. But I can't trust you

          anymore.

She stares up at him, inviting.

                       MAL

          So what?

INT. BEDROOM SUITE, JAPANESE CASTLE - MOMENTS LATER

Mal sips champagne as she studies a painting by Francis

Bacon.

                    MAL

          Looks like Arthur's taste.

Cobb is looking down through the window at the GUARDS

patrolling the castle at ground level.

                    COBB

          Actually, Mr. Saito is partial to

          postwar British painters.

He turns to Mal, donning a pair of black leather gloves.

                    COBB

          Would you sit down?

Mal lowers herself gracefully into a leather wingback chair.

Cobb approaches, pulls out a length of BLACK ROPE and kneels

at Mal's feet. She looks down at him.

                       MAL

          Tell me...

Cobb TIES the rope around the CHAIR LEGS.

                    MAL

          Do the children miss me?

Cobb pauses. He lets his gloved fingers lightly touch Mal's

ankle. He looks up at her.

                                                            7.

                    COBB

          You can't imagine.

Mal looks away, uncomfortable. Cobb gets to his feet, letting

out the rope as he moves back to the window.

                    MAL

          What're you doing?

Cobb tosses the rope out-

                    COBB

          Getting some air.

He tugs on the rope, testing. The weight of the chair, with

Mal on it, holds.

                    COBB

          Stay seated. Please.

And with that, he JUMPS. Mal considers the open window.

EXT. JAPANESE CASTLE WALL - CONTINUOUS

Cobb RAPPELS down the wall, darting past windows. He stops at

a particular one. Gets out a glass cutter-

Suddenly he starts DROPPING-

INT. BEDROOM SUITE, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

The EMPTY CHAIR SLIDES across the floor- WEDGES under the

window-

EXT. JAPANESE CASTLE WALL - CONTINUOUS

Cobb JOLTS to a stop 15 ft. lower. He looks up at the bedroom

window. Shakes his head. Starts climbing back.

INT. KITCHEN, JAPANESE CASTLE - MOMENTS LATER

Cobb drops silently from the window into the darkened

kitchen. He pulls a PISTOL from his belt, screwing a SILENCER

onto the barrel as he GLIDES across the room.

INT. HALL, JAPANESE CASTLE-CONTINUOUS

Cobb SLIPS through the shadows towards a GUARD stationed at

the head of a GRAND STAIRCASE...

The Guard HEARS something- TURNS- PEERS into the shadows...

Cobb FLASHES out of the shadows, silenced pistol up, AIMING-

                                                          8.

PHHT- head shot- the Guard starts to drop... but Cobb is

already there to CATCH him, sliding on his knees and lowering

the Guard SILENTLY to the floor.

INT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

Cobb moves to a PAINTING. With practiced hands he removes it

from the wall, revealing a SAFE. Cobb spins the dial, pulls

it OPEN, GRABS an envelope from within, stuffs it into his

waistband, where there is already an IDENTICAL ENVELOPE.

LIGHTS COME ON. Cobb freezes.

                    SAITO (O.S.)

          Turn around.

Cobb turns. At the far end of the room: Saito. Next to him is

Mal, gun in hand. She smiles at Cobb.

                    MAL

          The gun, Dom.

Cobb doesn't move. Mal motions outside- two GUARDS drag

Arthur into the room. Mal puts the gun to his head.

                    MAL

          Please.

Cobb slowly places his gun at his end of the long table, then

SLIDES it along the polished ebony. It comes to rest HALFWAY

down the length or the table.

                    SAITO

          Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb.

Cobb reaches into his waistband, removes ONE of the

envelopes, SLIDES it along the table. Steps back, hands

raised.

                     COBB

          Did she tell you, or have you known

          all along?

                     SAITO

          That you're here to steal from me?

              (beat)

          Or that we're actually asleep?

Arthur gives Cobb an I-told-you-so look.

                    SAITO

          I want to know who your employer

          is.

Mal COCKS the gun at Arthur's temple.

                                                           9.

                    COBB

          No point threatening him in a

          dream.

                    MAL

          That depends on what you're

          threatening. Killing him would just

          wake him up... but pain? Pain is in

          the mind...

Mal LOWERS the gun and SHOOTS Arthur in the leg- Arthur

drops, SCREAMING- Mal looks at Cobb, cold.

                    MAL

          And, judging by the decor, we're in

          your mind, aren't we, Arthur?

Cobb watches Arthur's PAIN. Mal aims at Arthur's other leg...

Cobb SPRINGS for the table, SKIDDING along its polished

surface- he GRABS his gun- SHOOTS ARTHUR BETWEEN THE EYES-

Arthur DROPS- the room starts to SHUDDER in a MASSIVE

EARTHQUAKE- Cobb SPRINGS for the door- Arthur's eyes stare at

the ceiling, DEAD, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - DAY

Arthur's EYES OPEN as he WAKES IN THE ARMCHAIR- he GRABS at

the tubes at his wrist, YANKING them free-

                    NASH

          What're you doing?! It's too soon-

FLUID spurts from the tubes as Arthur STRUGGLES with the

SILVER CASE on the bathroom floor.

                    ARTHUR

          I know! We have to reconnect the

          loop before they wake up!

Arthur grabs the case and pushes through the door to the

bedroom- following the tubes to where they meet Saito's wrist-

SAITO LIES ON THE BED ASLEEP. Saito STIRS and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. JAPANESE CASTLE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Cobb LURCHES towards the stairs, as all around him the

building BUCKS and HEAVES-

                                                           10.

INT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

Saito and the Guards PANIC. Mal walks calmly through the

destruction, picks up the envelope and turns to Saito.

                    MAL

          He was close. Very close.

EXT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

Cobb runs up the stairs, pulling out the SECOND ENVELOPE-

INT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

Saito RIPS open the envelope, pulls out sheets of paper. He

looks at Mal, PANICKED. He turns to the Guards-

                      SAITO

          Stop him!

Mal, confused, looks at the sheets of paper: THEY ARE BLANK.

Mal smiles, amused.

INT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

As Cobb runs up the stairs he reads the TYPEWRITTEN SHEETS

from his envelope, and we-

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Arthur OPENS the silver case: a COMPLEX MECHANISM of TUBES,

SYRINGES, DOSAGE CONTROLLERS. Arthur's hands fly across the

machine's controls as he glances at Saito's STIRRING face-

                    ARTHUR

          I'm not going to make it! Wake

          Cobb!

INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Nash turns to Cobb. Raises his hand and SMACKS him across the

face, and we-

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT

Cobb is SMASHED sideways off his feet...

                                                        11.

INT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT

The CEILING CRACKS above Saito- he looks up as a TON of STONE

floods down, CRUSHING HIM and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Saito's eyes FLICKER OPEN. AWAKE.

INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Nash SMACKS Cobb again-

                    NASH

          He won't wake!

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM-CONTINUOUS

Arthur crouched by Saito, connects the second tube.

                      ARTHUR

          Dunk him!

A CLICK: Arthur looks up to find Saito with a gun to his head

and a finger to his lips, gesturing silence...

INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Nash puts his hand on Cobb's forehead and PUSHES HIM

BACKWARDS- as Cobb starts to FALL BACKWARDS in the chair we

are in SLOW MOTION, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT

Cobb, full speed, picks himself up, scrambling to read the

last sheet of paper. He stares at it PUZZLED- bullets hit

around him as the Guards race up the stairs and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - DAY

Cobb in SLOW MOTION, hits the WATER- head THRASHING as he

goes under- and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT

Cobb glances up from the paper as WATER EXPLODES IN THROUGH

ALL THE WINDOWS, FLOODING THE ENTIRE HALL-

                                                        12.

COBB IS SWAMPED BY WATER, SPUN IN ALL DIRECTIONS AT ONCE- HE

PULLS DEEPER OR FOR THE SURFACE, WE CAN'T TELL...

HE BREAKS THE SURFACE, GASPING FOR AIR IN THE BATHTUB IN THE-

INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - DAY

Cobb's AWAKE, GULPING AIR, getting his bearings.

Saito SMASHES into the room, KNOCKING Nash down- Cobb

LAUNCHES himself out of the tub, FLYING dripping wet across

the room to SLAM Saito against the door- the gun DROPS,

Cobb's fist CONNECTS with Saito's jaw and the struggle is

over.

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Cobb, wet but composed, sits, turning Saito's gun in his

hand. Nash holds Saito's arms behind him. Outside, the sounds

of RIOTING grow louder.

                    COBB

          You came prepared.

                    SAITO

          I bring the gun because not even my

          head of security knows this

          apartment. How did you find it?

Arthur, at the window, looks out at the WORSENING VIOLENCE.

                    COBB

          Hard for a man in your position to

          keep a love nest totally secret...

          particularly when there's a married

          woman involved.

                    SAITO

          She would never...

                    COBB

          And yet, here we are.

Saito is silent.

                    COBB

          With a dilemma.

                    SAITO

          You got what you came for.

                     COBB

          Not quite. The key piece of

          information wasn't there, was it,

          Mr. Saito?

                                                         13.

Arthur looks over at Cobb, worried.

                    ARTHUR

          They're getting closer, Cobb.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY

Todashi slips a pair of HEADPHONES over Nash's ears, then

pulls out an MP3 player and we-

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Saito's eyes are on the floor.

                    COBB

          You held something back because you

          knew what we were up to...

Cobb uses the barrel of the gun to raise Saito's chin.

                    COBB

          So why let us in at all?

Saito smiles, defiant. VIOLENT NOISES echo up the stairway...

                    SAITO

          An audition.

                    COBB

          Audition for what?

                    SAITO

          It doesn't matter. You failed.

                    COBB

          I extracted all the information you

          had in there.

                    SAITO

          But your deception was readily

          apparent.

And we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY

Todashi opens the SILVER BRIEFCASE, revealing the complex

mechanism of syringes and controllers- FOUR CONTROLLERS

DISPLAY COUNTDOWNS.

                                                        14.

Todashi waits for the first countdown to hit "30," then HITS

PLAY on the MP3 player- He watches Nash's sleeping face as he

RAISES the volume...

Through Nash's headphones: the opening bars of Edith Piaf's

"Non, je ne regrette rien," and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY

In the distant background, strange MASSIVE low-end MUSICAL

start, sounding like DISTANT HORNS...

                    SAITO

          So leave me and go.

                    COBB

          You know the corporation who hired

          us won't accept failure. We won't

          last two days...

The DISTANT, SLOWED-DOWN MUSIC is becoming LOUDER, as are the

SHOUTS coming up the stairs. Arthur looks at his watch, its

SLOW SECOND TICKING MARKS TIME WITH THE MASSIVE MUSIC.

                    ARTHUR

          Come on, Cobb.

                    COBB

          So now I have to do this the old-

          fashioned way-

Cobb GRABS SAITO AND PUTS HIS HEAD TO THE FLOOR, gun pressed

into his cheek. Saito looks into Cobb's eyes- sees he will

pull the trigger. Saito BLINKS, looks away in shame-

When he NOTICES SOMETHING. And starts LAUGHING.

                    SAITO

          I've always hated this carpet.

Cobb's eyes flick to the carpet and back.

                    SAITO

          It's stained and frayed in such

          distinctive ways...

Cobb looks up at Nash, who shrugs, at a loss.

                    SAITO

          But very definitely made of wool.

          Right now I'm lying on polyester.

                                                           15.

Cobb glares at Nash, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY

Todashi watches the first of the countdowns hit ZERO- He

looks up at Arthur, STIRRING, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM-DAY

Saito turns from the carpet to look up at Cobb.

                    SAITO

          Which means I'm not lying on my

          carpet, in my apartment...

              (smiles)

          You've lived up to your reputation,

          Mr. Cobb... I'm still dreaming.

Cobb looks over to Arthur, but ARTHUR HAS VANISHED, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY

Arthur's eyes flicker open, AWAKE. He RIPS at his tubes.

                    TODASHI

          How'd it go?

                      ARTHUR

          Not good.

Arthur checks the remaining three countdowns, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Saito gets to his feet, looking admiringly at Cobb.

                     SAITO

          A dream within a dream-I'm

          impressed.

Cobb lowers the gun. Defeated. Glances at his watch. The

music REVERBERATES, the RIOTERS BANG ON THE DOOR, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

                                                        16.

INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY

Arthur retracts the tubes into the case as he watches the

next countdown hit ZERO, and we-

                                                   CUT TO:

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Another BANG on the door- Saito, confident now, approaches

Cobb. Nash is behind Saito.

                    SAITO

          But in my dream, we really ought to

          be playing by my rules...

                    NASH

          Ah, yes, but you see, Mr. Saito-

Saito turns to Nash-

                    COBB

          We're not in your dream-

Saito turns back to Cobb, BUT COBB HAS VANISHED-

                    NASH

          We're in mine.

Saito SPINS back to Nash- the DOOR SMASHES OFF ITS HINGES AS

RIOTERS POUR INTO THE ROOM, SWARMING OVER NASH... BUT NASH IS

GONE. The music DIES. Saito and the rioters stand there in

the SILENCE, the light DWINDLING... and we-

                                                   CUT TO:

INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY

Nash' eyes open, AWAKE.

                       ARTHUR (O.S.)

          Asshole!

Nash BLINKS. Arthur is in his face, furious.

                    ARTHUR

          How could you get the carpet

          wrong?!

                    NASH

          It wasn't my fault!

                    ARTHUR

          You're the architect-

                                                        17.

                    NASH

          I didn't know he was going to rub

          his damn cheek on it!

Cobb pulls Arthur away from Nash.

                     COBB

          Lets go.

                    ARTHUR

          And you-what the hell was all that?

                    COBB

          I had it under control.

                    ARTHUR

          I'd hate to see out of control-

                    COBB

          There's no time for this-I'm

          getting off at Kyoto.

                    ARTHUR

          Why? He's not gonna search every

          compartment.

                    COBB

          I can't stand trains.

Arthur moves to the briefcase. Turns a dial.

                    ARTHUR

          I can keep him under for one minute-

Arthur hits a button- A PLUNGER DEPRESSES. Cobb RIPS the tape

off Saito's wrist, ROLLS up his tubes. Arthur SLAMS the

silver case shut. Todashi pulls open the door-

                    COBB

          Every man for himself.

Arthur and Nash EXIT, heading in different directions down

the corridor. Cobb hands Todashi a thick roll of CASH, looks

at Saito, who stirs. Cobb moves off.

EXT. JAPANESE COUNTRYSIDE - CONTINUOUS

The BULLET TRAIN speeds through the lush landscape.

INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Saito WAKES GENTLY. Looks around the compartment, empty but

for Todashi, reading a comic. Saito looks down at his wrist.

Sees a small mark. Rubs it. SMILES.

                                                        18.

EXT. TOKYO - DUSK

Moving over the vast city towards a high rise. A HELICOPTER

thumps into frame, heading for a pad on the roof.

INT. APARTMENT, TOKYO - CONTINUOUS

Cobb sits, waiting. Checks his watch, restless. He pulls a

HANDGUN. Checks it is loaded. places it on the table in front

of him. Pulls out a PEWTER SPINNING TOP, SPINS it on the

table ... He INTENT STUDIES the top's spin... As he stares,

the sound of a FREIGHT TRAIN builds and builds- the top

WOBBLES, TIPS onto its side- the sound of the train STOPS.

the PHONE RINGS- Cobb GRABS it-

                    CHILDREN'S VOICES (over phone)

          Hi, Daddy! Hi, Dad.

                    COBB

          Hey, guys. How are you?

                    CHILDREN'S VOICES (over phone)

          Good. Okay, I guess.

Cobb closes his eyes, trying to picture his children: INSERT

CUT: COBB's MEMORY- a LITTLE BLONDE BOY (3), back towards us,

crouches IN A GARDEN, looks at something in the grass...

                    COBB

          Who's just okay? Was that James?

                    JAMES (over phone)

          Yeah. When are you coming home?

                    COBB

          I can't. Not for a while.

INSERT CUT: A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL (5), also FACE UNSEEN, joins

JAMES, CROUCHING BESIDE HIM...

                    JAMES (over phone)

          Why?

                    COBB

          Well, James, like I've told you-I'm

          away because I'm working...

                    LITTLE GIRL (over phone)

          Grandma says you're never coming

          back.

Cobb pauses. Takes a breath. INSERT CUT: James and Philippa,

FACES UNSEEN, lift their heads from the grass, responding to

someone's call- they RUN AWAY FROM US ACROSS THE GARDEN...

                                                          19.

                    COBB

          Philippa, can you ask Grandma to

          pick up the phone-

                    PHILIPPA (over phone)

          She's shaking her head.

Cobb TENSES, as if about to SMASH the phone.

                    COBB

          Well, we'll just have to hope

          Grandma's wrong about that won't

          we?

                    JAMES

              (over phone)

          Daddy?

                    COBB

          Yes?

                    JAMES (over phone)

          Is Mommy with you?

Cobb looks like he just got punched- INSERT CUT: COBB'S

MEMORY- MAL, WIND BLOWING HER HAIR, SMILES CALMLY...

                    COBB

          No. No, we talked about this,

          James. Mommy's gone.

                    JAMES (over phone)

          Where?

                    GRANDMA'S VOICE (over phone)

          Time to go, kids. Say bye-bye-

                    COBB

          I'll give some presents to Grandpa,

          okay? Just be good for-

Cobb STARES at the dead phone. Then DOWNS his drink- A KNOCK

at the door. Cobb GRABS the top, the gun- MOVES to the door-

cracks it: Arthur.

                    ARTHUR

          Our ride's on the roof.

Cobb nods. Moves to pick up his bag. Arthur watches.

                    ARTHUR

          Cobb... are you okay?

Cobb looks up.

                                                           20.

                       COBB

          Yeah, why?

                    ARTHUR

          Down in the dream... Mal showing up

          like that ...

                    COBB

          Yeah. I'm sorry about your leg.

                    ARTHUR

          It's getting worse, isn't it?

                    COBB

          One apology's all you're getting,

          Arthur. Now, where's Nash?

                    ARTHUR

          Hasn't shown. Wanna wait?

                    COBB

              (shakes head)

          We were supposed to deliver Saito's

          expansion plans to Cobol Engineering

          two hours ago. By now they know we

          failed. Time to disappear.

INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Cobb and Arthur head towards the elevator.

                    ARTHUR

          Where will you go?

                    COBB

          Buenos Aires. I can lie low there.

          Maybe sniff out a job when things

          quiet down. You?

                       ARTHUR

          Stateside.

                    COBB

              (wistful) )

          'Course. Send my regards.

Arthur looks at Cobb. Nods. Sympathetic.

EXT. ROOFTOP HELIPAD - NIGHT

The HELICOPTER sits, ROTORS SPINNING. As Cobb and Arthur

reach the door, it SLIDES OPEN. Cobb steps up into the

leather-padded interior. He freezes.

                                                        21.

INT. HELICOPTER ON PAD - CONTINUOUS

Nash, BEATEN BLOODY, sits on the far side, slumped against

the wine. Beside him: SAITO. He nods politely at Cobb.

                    SAITO

          He sold you out. Thought to come to

          me and bargain for his life...

Saito's BODYGUARD offers Cobb a GUN.

                    SAITO

          So I offer you the satisfaction.

                    COBB

          That's not how I deal with things.

                    SAITO

          Would you work with him again?

Cobb shakes his head. Saito's BODYGUARDS PULL Nash from the

chopper. Saito motions Cobb and Arthur to sit. The chopper

RISES. Cobb watches Nash DRAGGED across the pad.

                    COBB

          What will you do to him?

                    SAITO

          Nothing. But I can't speak for your

          friends from Cobol Engineering.

Saito looks out at the city slipping by.

                    COBB

          What do you want from us?

                       SAITO

          Inception.

Arthur raises his eyebrows. Cobb is poker-faced.

                    SAITO

          Is it possible?

                    ARTHUR

          Of course not.

                    SAITO

          If you can steal an idea from

          someone's mind, why can't you plant

          one there instead?

                    ARTHUR

          Okay, here's planting an idea: I

          say to you, "Don't think about

          elephants."

                    (MORE)

                                                        22.

                    ARTHUR (CONT'D)

              (Saito nods)

          What are you thinking about?

                       SAITO

          Elephants.

                    ARTHUR

          Right. But it's not your idea

          because you know I gave it to you.

                    SAITO

          You could plant it subconsciously-

                    ARTHUR

          The subject's mind can always trace

          the genesis of the idea. True

          inspiration is impossible to fake.

                    COBB

          No, it isn't.

                    SAITO

          Can you do it?

                    COBB

          I won't do it.

                    SAITO

          In exchange, I'll give you the

          information you were paid to steal.

                    COBB

          Are you giving me a choice? Because

          I can find my own way to square

          things with Cobol.

                    SAITO

          Then you do have a choice.

                    COBB

          And I choose to leave.

EXT. AIRFIELD - MOMENTS LATER

The helicopter sets down next to a PRIVATE JET.

INT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

Saito indicates the plane.

                    SAITO

          Tell the crew where you want to go,

          they'll file the plan en route.

Cobb and Arthur look at each other. Then move for the door.

                                                23.

                    SAITO

          Mr. Cobb...? There is one other

          thing I could offer you.

              (Cobb stops)

          How would you like to go home? To

          America. To your children.

Cobb turns back to Saito.

                    COBB

          You can't fix that. Nobody could.

                    SAITO

          Just like inception.

Cobb considers this. Arthur touches his arm.

                    ARTHUR

          Cobb, come on-

                    COBB

          How complex is the idea?

                    SAITO

          Simple enough.

                    COBB

          No idea's simple when you have to

          plant it in someone else's mind.

                    SAITO

          My main competitor is an old man in

          poor health. His son will soon

          inherit control of the corporation.

          I need him to decide to break up

          his father's empire. Against his

          own self-interest.

                    ARTHUR

          Cobb, we should walk away from

          this.

                    COBB

          If I were to do it. If I could do

          it... how do I know you can

          deliver?

                    SAITO

          You don't. But I can. So do you

          want to take a leap of faith, or

          become an old man, filled with

          regret, waiting to die alone?

Cobb looks at Saito. Barely nods.

                                                          24.

                    SAITO

          Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb. And

          choose your people more wisely.

INT. PRIVATE JET - LATER

Cobb reclines his seat. Arthur picks at a salad, angry.

                    ARTHUR

          I know how much you want to go home-

                    COBB

              (sharp)

          No, you don't.

                    ARTHUR

          But this can't be done.

                    COBB

          It can. You just have to go deep

          enough.

                    ARTHUR

          You don't know that!-

                    COBB

          I've done it before.

Arthur is taken aback. Cobb turns to the window.

                    ARTHUR

          Did it work?

                       COBB

                 (quiet)

          Yes.

                    ARTHUR

          Who did you do it to?

Cobb looks at Arthur. Closed. Arthur shrugs.

                    ARTHUR

          So why are we headed to Paris?

                     COBB

          We're going to need a new

          architect.

INT. GREAT HALL, ECOLE D'ARCHITECTURE - MORNING

Cobb, carrying a shopping bag, looks into a lecture hall: no

students, just a RUMPLED PROFESSOR hunched over paperwork.

                                                        25.

INT. LECTURE HALL - CONTINUOUS

                    COBB (O.S.)

          You never did like your office.

PROFESSOR MILES looks up, squinting. Recognizes Cobb.

                    MILES

          No space to think in that broom

          cupboard.

Cobb steps down past the empty wooden rows.

                    MILES

          Is it safe for you to be here?

                    COBB

          Extradition between France and the

          U.S. is a bureaucratic nightmare.

                    MILES

          I think they'd find a way to make

          it work in your case.

Cobb hand Miles the shopping bag.

                    COBB

          Can you take these back for the

          kids?

                    MILES

          It'll take more than the occasional

          stuffed animal to convince those

          children they still have a father.

                    COBB

          I know. I thought you could talk to

          Marie about bringing them on

          vacation. Somewhere I could meet-

                    MILES

          Why would she listen to me?

                    COBB

          You were married for twenty years.

                    MILES

          She blames me as much as you.

                    COBB

          Doesn't she understand that my kids

          need me?

                                                26.

                    MILES

          Yes, she does. We all do. Go back

          and face the music, Dom. Explain

          what Mal did.

                    COBB

          Be realistic, Stephen. They'd never

          understand- they'd lock me up and

          throwaway the key. Or worse.

                    MILES

          You think what you're doing now is

          helping your case?

                    COBB

          Lawyers don't pay for themselves.

          This is what I have. This is what

          you taught me.

                    MILES

          I never taught you to be a thief.

                    COBB

          No, you taught me to navigate other

          people's minds. But after what

          happened with Mal there weren't a

          whole lot of legitimate ways for me

          to use that skill.

Miles looks at Cobb.

                    MILES

          Why did you come here, Dom?

Cobb shifts slightly.

                     COBB

          I found a way home. A job. For

          powerful people. If I pull it off,

          I can get back to my family. But I

          need help.

Miles realizes something.

                    MILES

          My God. You're here to corrupt one

          of my brightest and best.

                    COBB

          If you have someone good enough,

          you have to let them decide for

          themselves. You know what I'm

          offering-

                       MILES

          Money?

                                                27.

                    COBB

          No, not just money: the chance to

          build cathedrals, entire cities-

          things that have never existed,

          things that couldn't exist in the

          real world...

                    MILES

          Everybody dreams, Cobb. Architects

          are supposed to make those dreams

          real.

                    COBB

          That's not what you used to say.

          You told me that in the real world

          I'd be building attic conversions

          and gas stations. You said that if

          I mastered the dream-share I'd have

          a whole new way of creating and

          showing people my creations. You

          told me it would free me.

Miles looks at Cobb, sad.

                    MILES

          And I'm sorry. I was wrong.

                    COBB

          No, you weren't. Your vision was a

          vision of pure creativity. It's

          where we took it that was wrong.

                    MILES

          And now you want me to let someone

          else follow you into fantasy.

                    COBB

          They won't actually come on the

          job, they'll just design the levels

          and teach them to the dreamers.

                    MILES

          Design them yourself.

                    COBB

          Mal won't let me.

Miles looks at Cobb. Appalled.

                    MILES

          Come back to reality, Dom. Please.

                    COBB

          You want to know what's real,

          Stephen? Your grandchildren waiting

          for their dad to come back.

                    (MORE)

                                                        28.

                    COBB (CONT'D)

          This job-this last job-is how I get

          there.

Miles looks down, fiddles with his papers.

                    COBB

          I wouldn't be standing here if

          there were any other way. I can get

          home. But I need an architect who's

          as good as I was.

Miles looks Cobb in the eye. Decides.

                    MILES

          I've got someone better.

INT. CORRIDOR - LATER

Miles and Cobb stand by as STUDENTS file out of a lecture.

                       MILES

          Ariadne...

A young woman carrying books turns. This is ARIADNE.

                    MILES

          I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.

She sizes him up with quick eyes. Offers her hand.

                    ARIADNE

          Pleased to meet you.

                    MILES

          If you have a few moments, Mr. Cobb

          has a job offer to discuss with

          you.

                    ARIADNE

          A work placement?

                    COBB

              (smiles

          Not exactly.

EXT. ROOFTOP, ECOLE D'ARCHITECTURE - MOMENTS LATER

Ariadne leans against the parapet, overlooking Paris. She

unwraps a sandwich, watching Cobb pull out a pad of GRAPH

PAPER and a PEN. He offers them. She bites her sandwich.

                       COBB

          A test.

                                                           29.

                    ARIADNE

              (mouth full)

          Aren't you going to tell me

          anything?

                    COBB

          Before I describe the job, I have

          to know you could do it.

                    ARIADNE

          Why?

                    COBB

          It's not, strictly speaking, legal.

Ariadne raises her eyebrows.

                    COBB

          You have two minutes to draw a maze

          that takes me one minute to solve.

Ariadne takes the pad and pen. Cobb looks at his watch.

                    COBB

          Go.

She starts DRAWING LINES on the grid, constructing a maze.

                    COBB

          Stop.

Ariadne hands the pad and pen to Cobb. He glances at the pad,

then, looking her in the eye, TRACES the solution. She is

taken aback. Cobb RIPS off the sheet, hands the pad back.

                    COBB

          Again.

She traces straight lines, CONCENTRATING...

                    COBB

          Stop.

She hands Cobb the pad, a touch pleased. Cobb solves the

puzzle instantly, as before. Her smile falls.

                    COBB

          You'll have to-

She GRABS the pad, frustrated... but this time she FLIPS it

over and starts drawing on the BLANK CARDBOARD of the back.

Cobb watches, surprised. He smiles as he sees that she's

drawing CIRCLES, creating a maze based on concentric rings.

Ariadne hands back the pad, defiant. Cobb takes the pen,

starts the maze. This time he gets stuck. Nods.

                                                           30.

                    COBB

              (working the maze)

          More like it.

EXT. NARROW STREET, PARIS - DAY

Arthur stops at a warehouse door. Consults a piece of paper.

INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

A large, dusty warehouse. The SLIDING DOOR cracks open.

Arthur enters. Looks around, approvingly.

INT. SAME - LATER

Arthur DRAGS LAWN CHAIRS into the middle of the room. He

erects a table. Lays out several SILVER CASES, unpacking

them, laying out lines of tubing, MECHANISMS...

EXT. PARISIAN CAFE - DAY

Cobb and Ariadne sit at an outdoor table.

                    COBB

          They say we only use a fraction of

          the true potential of our brains...

          but they're talking about when

          we're awake. While we dream, the

          mind performs wonders.

                     ARIADNE

          Such as?

                    COBB

          How do you imagine a building? You

          consciously create each aspect,

          puzzling over it in stages... But

          sometimes, when your imagination

          flies-

                    ARIADNE

          I'm discovering it.

                    COBB

          Exactly. Genuine inspiration.

Cobb leans forwards and draws on the paper table cloth.

                    COBB

          In a dream your mind continuously

          does that...

Cobb has drawn a circle made of two arrows.

                                                     31.

                    COBB

          It creates and perceives a world

          simultaneously. So well that you

          don't feel your brain doing the

          creating. That's why we can short-

          circuit the process...

                    ARIADNE

          How?

                    COBB

          By taking over the creating part.

Cobb draws a straight line between the two arrows.

                    COBB

          This is where you come in. You

          build the world of the dream. We

          take the subject into that dream,

          and let him 111 it with his

          subconscious

                    ARIADNE

          But are you trying to fool him that

          the dream is actually real life?

                     COBB

              (nods)

          While we're in there, We don't want

          him to realize he's dreaming.

                    ARIADNE

          How could I ever get enough detail

          to Convince him that it's real?

                    COBB

          Our dreams reel real while we're in

          them. It's only when we wake up we

          realize things were strange,

Ariadne gestures around them-

                    ARIADNE

          But all the textures of real life-

          the stone, the fabric. cars...

          people... your mind can't create

          all this.

                    COBB

          It does. Every time you dream. Let

          me ask you a question: You never

          remember the beginning of your

          dreams, do you? You just turn up in

          the middle of what's going on.

                                                        32.

                       ARIADNE

          I guess.

                    COBB

          So... how did we end up at this

          restaurant?

                    ARIADNE

          We came here from...

Ariadne trails off, confused.

                    COBB

          How did we get here? Where are we?

Ariadne THINKS, unable to remember. A FAINT RUMBLE begins.

                    ARIADNE

          Oh my God. We're dreaming.

Cobb nods. The RUMBLE is BUILDING.

                    COBB

          Stay calm. We're actually asleep in

          the workshop. This is your first

          lesson in shared dreaming,

          remember?

Ariadne looks around, mind REELING. Cobb BRACES-

The restaurant VIOLENTLY FRAGMENTS, EXPLODING AND IMPLODING

PARTICLES OF FURNITURE, WALLS, PEOPLE FLYING AROUND- Ariadne

WONDERS at the MAYHEM WHIRLING around them- Cobb SHIELDS his

head against the debris. She sees him-

                    ARIADNE

              (shouting over noise)

          If it's just a dream, why are you

          covering your-

Ariadne is WIPED FROM HER SEAT BY A MASSIVE BLAST and we-

                                                   CUT TO:

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

Ariadne JOLTS awake.

                    COBB (O.S.)

          Because it's never just a dream.

Ariadne turns to Cobb's voice. They are both sitting in the

lawn chairs. Arthur watches over them.

                                                        33.

                    COBB

          And a face full of glass hurts like

          hell, doesn't it? While we're in

          it, it's real.

                    ARTHUR

          That's why the military developed

          dream sharing-a training program

          where soldiers could strangle, stab

          and shoot each other, then wake up.

                    ARIADNE

          How did architects get involved?

                    COBB

          Someone had to design the dreams.

              (to Arthur)

          Let's go another five minutes-

                    ARIADNE

          We were only asleep for five

          minutes? We talked for an hour at

          least...

                    COBB

          When you dream, your mind functions

          more quickly, so time seems to pass

          more slowly.

                    ARTHUR

          Five minutes in the real world

          gives you an hour in the dream.

                    COBB

          Let's see how much trouble you can

          cause in five minutes.

And we-

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT. SAME PARISIAN STREET - DAY

Ariadne walks down the crowded street with Cobb. Cobb looks

around at the street, the cafe, approving.

                    COBB

          It's good. You've got the cafe, the

          layout... you forgot the book shop

          but pretty much everything else is

          here.

Ariadne looks at the passers-by.

                    ARIADNE

          Who are the people?

                                                        34.

                    COBB

          They're projections of my

          subconscious.

                     ARIADNE

          Yours?

                    COBB

          Sure-you are the dreamer, I am the

          subject. My subconscious populates

          your world. That's one way we get

          at a subject's thoughts-his mind

          creates the people, so we can

          literally talk to his subconscious.

                    ARIADNE

          How else do you do it?

                    COBB

          Architecture. Build a bank vault or

          a jail, something secure, and the

          subject's mind will fill it with

          information he's trying to protect.

                    ARIADNE

          Then you break in and steal it.

                     COBB

          Exactly.

Ariadne wonders at the detail of the street.

                     ARIADNE

          I love the concrete sense of things-

              (stamps foot)

          Real weight, you know? I thought a

          dream space would be all about the

          visual, but it's the feel of

          things. Question is, what happens

          as you start to mess with

          physics...

She CONCENTRATES on the street. The street starts to BEND IN

HALF- the buildings on either side FOLDING IN until they form

the INSIDE OF A CUBE OF CITY, GRAVITY FUNCTIONING

INDEPENDENTLY ON EACH PLANE. Ariadne looks up (or down) at

the people on the opposite city surface. Cobb watches her

excitement.

                    ARIADNE

          It's something, isn't it?

                    COBB

              (quiet)

          Yes. It is.

                                                        35.

As they walk, Ariadne notices more and more of the

projections STARING at her.

                    ARIADNE

          Why are they looking at me?

                    COBB

          Because you're changing things. My

          subconscious feels that someone

          else is creating the world. The

          more you change things, the quicker

          the projections converge on you.

                      ARIADNE

          Converge?

                    COBB

          They feel the foreign nature of the

          dreamer, and attack-like white

          blood cells fighting an infection.

                    ARIADNE

          They're going to attack us?

                    COBB

          Just you, actually.

They walk along the street to where it joins the next

gravitational plane. They step up onto the different plane

and walk down the street towards a river. As Ariadne

approaches, steps emerge from the flagstone, and she leads

Cobb up onto a small jetty. As she concentrates, pillars

emerge and a BRIDGE starts to telescope out from the jetty.

They step onto it as it grows. Cobb is impressed.

                    COBB

          It's beautiful... but if you keep

          on changing things...

People crossing the bridge STARE at Ariadne. Several of them

BUMP her shoulder as they pass.

                    ARIADNE

          Mind telling your subconscious to

          take it easy?

                    COBB

          That's why it's called subconscious.

          I don't control it.

The bridge now spans the Seine. Cobb marvels at it.

                    COBB

          Arched stone, iron pillars...

          it's...

                                                          36.

Cobb pauses, thinking. Remembering.

INSERT CUT: Mal, hair blowing, turns to Cobb, smiling,

laughing. He smiles back. They are on the same bridge.

                    COBB

          I know this bridge. This place is

          real-

              (serious)

          You didn't imagine it, you

          remembered it...

                     ARIADNE

              (nods)

          I cross it every day on my way to

          the college.

                    COBB

          Never recreate places from your

          memory. Always imagine new places.

                    ARIADNE

          You have to draw from what you know-

                    COBB

              (tense)

          Use pieces-a streetlamp,

          phonebooths, a type of brick-not

          whole areas.

Several people around them ECHO Cobb's attitude...

                     ARIADNE

          Why not?

                    COBB

          Because building dreams out of your

          own memories is the surest way to

          lose your grip on what's real and

          what's a dream.

                    ARIADNE

          Did that happen to you?

Cobb says nothing. He stands there, starinq at Ariadne.

PEOPLE around her stop and look at her, hostile.

                    COBB

          Look, this isn't about me-

Cobb reaches for Ariadne's arm, turns her to him-

                    ARIADNE

          Is that why you need me to build

          your dreams?

                                                         37.

A passerby GRABS Ariadne's shoulder-

                    COBB

          Leave her alone-

More of the crowd join in, PULLING at Ariadne, holding her

arms open- Cobb PULLS people off- the crowd PUSHES him away-

Cobb sees someone WALKING PURPOSEFULLY through the crowd

towards the helpless, Ariadne- it is Mal. She approaches with

even strides- Ariadne stares at her, uneasy.

                    ARIADNE

          Wake me up, Cobb.

As Mal walks, she pulls out a LARGE KNIFE-

                       COBB

          Mal, no!

                    ARIADNE

          Wake me up!

Ariadne SCREAMS as Mal LUNGES at her with the knife and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. WORKSHOP-DAY

Ariadne WAKES, BREATHING HARD. Arthur moves to her-

                       ARTHUR

          It's okay.

                    ARIADNE

          Why couldn't I wake?

                    ARTHUR

          The only way to wake from inside

          the dream is to die.

Cobb, in the lawn chair opposite, PULLS his tubes out.

                    COBB

          She'll need a totem.

                       ARIADNE

          What?

                    ARTHUR

          Some kind of personal icon. A small

          object that you can always have

          with you, and that no one else

          knows,

Cobb gets to his feet, Ariadne stares at him, furious. He

heads to the bathroom.

                                                          38.

                     ARIADNE

          That's some subconscious you've

          got, Cobb.

              (calls after him)

          She's a real charmer!

                    ARTHUR

          Sounds like you've met Mrs. Cobb.

                    ARIADNE

              (surprised)

          She's his wife?

Arthur nods, pulling off Ariadne's tubes.

                    ARTHUR

          So. A totem. You need something

          small, potentially heavy...

INT. BATHROOM, WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

Cobb takes out his PEWTER SPINNING TOP, SPINS it on the

marble counter...

INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

Ariadne looks at Arthur, puzzled.

                    ARIADNE

          Like a coin?

                    ARTHUR

          Too common. You need something that

          has a weight or movement that only

          you know.

INT. BATHROOM, WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

Cobb STUDIES the spin of the top as it decays, becoming more

and more ECCENTRIC...

INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

                    ARIADNE

          What's yours?

Arthur holds out a DIE.

                    ARTHUR

          A loaded die.

Ariadne reaches for it- Arthur snatches sit away-

                                                          39.

                    ARTHUR

          I can't let you handle it. That's

          the point. No one else can know the

          weight or balance of it.

                     ARIADNE

          Why?

                    ARTHUR

          So when you examine your totem...

INT. BATHROOM, WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

Cobb's spinning top WOBBLES OVER.

                    ARTHUR (O.S.)

          You know, beyond a doubt, that

          you're not in someone else's dream.

Cobb GRABS it like a drowning man reaching for a lifeline.

INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

Ariadne thinks this over.

                    ARIADNE

          That's not an issue for me.

                     ARTHUR

          Why not?

                    ARIADNE

          Arthur, maybe you can't see what's

          going on, maybe you don't want to.

          But Cobb's got problems he's tried

          to bury down there. I'm not going

          to open my mind to someone like

          that.

Ariadne gets to her feet. Walks away.

                    COBB (O.S.)

          She'll be back.

Arthur turns. Cobb is standing in the bathroom doorway.

                    COBB

          I've never seen anyone pick it up

          so fast. And one reality won't be

          enough for her now. When she comes

          back, get her building mazes.

                    ARTHUR

          Where will you be?

                                                           40.

                    COBB

          I've got to talk to Eames.

                    ARTHUR

          Eames? But he's in Mombasa. Cobol's

          backyard.

                    COBB

          Necessary risk.

                    ARTHUR

          There are plenty of other thieves.

                    COBB

          We don't just need a thief. We need

          a forger.

INT. GAMBLING DEN, MOMBASA - DAY

Crowded, bustling, smoke-filled. a westerner (40's), shabby

suit, is squeezed in at a dice game. This is EAMES. He

FIDDLES with his last two chips.

                    COBB (O.S.)

          Rub them against each other all you

          like, they're not going to breed.

Eames looks up to see Cobb.

                    EAMES

          You never know.

Eames tosses down his last chips. The dice are rolled...

                      COBB

          Drink?

Eames loses.

                    EAMES

          You're buying.

Cobb follows Eames. Eames mysteriously produces two stacks of

chips and puts them down in front of the cashier. Cobb pulls

one off the top, squints at the embossed name.

                    COBB

          You're spelling hasn't improved.

Eames GRABS the chip. Hands it to the cashier.

                      EAMES

          Piss off.

                    COBB

          How's your handwriting?

                                                        41.

Eames takes his money. Smiles at Cobb.

                       EAMES

          Versatile.

INT. STREET, MOMBASA - CONTINUOUS

Eames leads Cobb down the quiet street.

                    EAMES

          Word is, you're not welcome in

          these parts.

                       COBB

          Yeah?

                    EAMES

          There's a price on your head from

          Cobol Engineering. Pretty big one,

          actually.

                    COBB

          You wouldn't sell me out.

Eames looks at Cobb, offended.

                    EAMES

          `Course I would.

                    COBB

              (smiles)

          Not when you hear what I'm selling.

EXT. BALCONY OF A COFFEE HOUSE - LATER

A ramshackle balcony overlooking a bust street. Eames pours.

                       COBB

          Inception.

Eames's glass stops halfway to his mouth.

                    COBB

          Don't bother telling me it's

          impossible.

                    EAMES

          It's perfectly possible. Just

          bloody difficult.

                    COBB

          That's what I keep saying to

          Arthur.

                                      42.

          EAMES

Arthur? You're still working with

that stick-in-the-mud?

          COBB

He's a good point man.

          EAMES

The best. But he has no

imagination. If you're going to

perform inception, you need

imagination.

          COBB

You've done it before?

          EAMES

Yeas and no. We tried it. Got the

idea in place, but it didn't take.

          COBB

You didn't plant it deep enough?

          EAMES

It's not just about depth. You need

the simplest version of the idea-

the one that will grow naturally in

the subject's mind. Subtle art.

          COBB

That's why I'm here.

          EAMES

What's the idea you need to plant?

          COBB

We want the heir to a major

corporation to break up his

father's empire.

          EAMES

See, right there you've got various

political motivations, anti-

monopolistic sentiment and so

forth. But all that stuff's at the

mercy of the subject's prejudice-

you have to go to the basic.

            COBB

Which is?

          EAMES

The relationship with the father.

    (downs drink)

Do you have a chemist?

                                                        43.

Cobb shakes his head.

                     EAMES

          There's a man here. Yusuf. He

          formulates his own versions of the

          compounds.

                    COBB

          Let's go see him.

                    EAMES

          Once you've lost your tail.

              (Cobb reacts)

          Back by the bar, blue tie. Came in

          about two minutes after we did.

                    COBB

          Cobol Engineering?

                    EAMES

          They pretty much own Mombasa.

Cobb glances over the balcony.

                    COBB

          Run interference. We'll meet

          downstairs in half an hour.

                       EAMES

          Back here?

                    COBB

          Last place they'd expect.

Eames downs his drink. Rises. Walks over to the Businessman.

                       EAMES

          Freddy!

The Businessman looks up, awkward.

                    EAMES

          Freddy Simmonds, it is you!

Cobb nonchalantly SLIPS over the balcony DROPPING HARD into

the midst of the crowd on the street below.

                    EAMES

              (looks harder)

          Oh. No, it isn't.

EXT. STREET, MOMBASA - CONTINUOUS

Cobb stands up, PUSHES into the crowd- faces PEER at him- he

moves, trying to blend- TURNS- a SECOND BUSINESS MAN is

there.

                                                           44.

                       COBB

                 (disarming smile)

          Yes?

                    SECOND BUSINESSMAN

          We need to-

Cobb HEAD BUTTS the Second Businessman, PUSHES past him-

The First Businessman races out of the bar, sees Cobb's wake,

DIVES after him- Cobb RACES headlong through tight

passageways, WEAVING through or KNOCKING into the locals...

He steps into a dark, crowded cafe, scanning the tables...

the First Businessman enters, spots him. An AFRICAN MAN gets

in Cobb's face, jabbering at him in Swahili- Cobb considers

his options... the First Businessman DRAWS A GUN- Cobb bolts,

steps up on a table and out an open window, SCRAMBLING into

the alley outside...

Cobb LOOKS left, right... CUTS LEFT into a narrow, CROWDED

alley- the alley NARROWS TO A DEAD END. Faces in the CROWD

start to watch Cobb- PEOPLE start to SURROUND him- Cobb looks

back the way he came- the two Businessmen are there, GUNS

DRAWN-

Cobb sees a SMALL GAP between the buildings at the narrow end-

he THROWS himself into it- gets STUCK HALFWAY...

The crowd bears down, GRABBING for him as Cobb struggles to

SQUEEZE HIMSELF through the gap... Cobb's moving INCHES as

his pursuers gain YARDS... the Crowd is upon him... he BURSTS

FREE. TUMBLING onto the next street, ROLLING out of sight.

Cobb Jumps to his feet- in a market square. TWO MORE

BUSINESSMEN move towards him. Cobb BOLTS but a CAR SKIDS UP,

BLOCKS HIS PATH- the door opens- SAITO IS IN THE BACK.

                    SAITO

          Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?

                    COBB

              (jumping in)

          What brings you to Mombasa, Mr.

          Saito?

                    SAITO

          I have to protect my investment.

EXT. COFFEE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Eames stands on the pavement. The car pulls up. Cobb beckons

from the rear window. Eames looks at Saito. Back to Cobb.

                    EAMES

          This is your idea of losing a tail?

                                                        45.

                    COBB

              (shrugs)

          Different tail.

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

Arthur sits at the table, working on a mechanism. A small

COUGH prompts him to look up: Ariadne is there.

                    ARTHUR

          He said you'd be back.

                    ARIADNE

          I tried not to come.

                    ARTHUR

          But there's nothing else quite like

          it.

                    ARIADNE

          No paper, no pens... nothing

          between you and raw, direct

          creation.

Arthur picks up his mechanism.

                    ARTHUR

          Shall we take a look at paradoxical

          architecture?

Ariadne nods, takes off her coat and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. PENROSE STEPS - LATER

Arthur leads Ariadne down some busy steps in a large glass

and steel ATRIUM in an office complex.

                    ARTHUR

          You're going to have to master a

          few tricks if you're going to build

          three complete dream levels.

A SECRETARY DROPS some papers as they pass...

                    ARIADNE

          What sort of tricks?

They take a tight turn and continue down the next flight.

                    ARTHUR

          In a dream, you can cheat

          architecture into impossible

          shapes.

                    (MORE)

                                                        46.

                    ARTHUR (CONT'D)

          That lets you create closed loops,

          like the Penrose Steps. The

          infinite staircase.

Ariadne FREEZES- THEY ARE IN THE EXACT SPOT THEY STARTED

DESCENDING FROM, next to the Secretary gathering her papers.

Ariadne puzzles at the impossible construction of the stairs.

                    ARTHUR

          See...

Arthur stops her gently- they are on the highest step, with a

LARGE DROP to the next step. Arthur gestures at the drop.

                    ARTHUR

          Paradox. A closed loop like this

          helps you disguise the boundaries

          of the dream you've created.

                    ARIADNE

          How big do the levels have to be?

                    ARTHUR

          Anything from the floor of a

          building, to an entire city. But it

          has to be complicated enough for us

          to hide from the projections.

                    ARIADNE

          A maze.

                    ARTHUR

          And the better the maze-

                    ARIADNE

          The longer we have before the

          projections catch us.

Ariadne looks around. Sees people LOOKING at Arthur.

                    ARIADNE

          My subconscious seems polite

          enough.

                    ARTHUR

          You wait, they'll turn ugly. No one

          likes to see someone else messing

          around in their mind.

                    ARIADNE

          Cobb can't build anymore, can he?

                                                        47.

                    ARTHUR

          I don't know if he can't, but he

          won't. He thinks it's safer if he

          doesn't know the layouts.

                    ARIADNE

          Why?

                    ARTHUR

          He won't tell me. I think it's Mal.

          I think she's getting stronger.

                    ARIADNE

          His ex-wife?

                    ARTHUR

          She's not his ex.

                    ARIADNE

          They're still together?

Arthur turns to Ariadne. Gentle.

                    ARTHUR

          No. No, she's dead, Ariadne. What

          you see in there is just his

          projection of her.

                    ARIADNE

          What was she like in real life?

                    ARTHUR

              (quiet)

          She was lovely.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT. ROOFTOP, OLD TOWN, MOMBASA - DAY

Saito deposits a FILE in front of Cobb: PHOTOS, DOCUMENTS. As

Cobb runs through them, he passes them to Eames.

                    SAITO

          Robert Fischer, 32. Heir to the

          Fischer Morrow energy conglomerate.

          He's spent his whole life being

          groomed as successor-breaking up

          his father's empire will take a

          radical shift in his thinking.

                    COBB

          What's your problem with Fischer?

                    SAITO

          That's not your concern.

                                                          48.

                    COBB

          This isn't the usual corporate

          espionage, Mr. Saito. This is

          inception. The seed of the idea we

          plant will grow in this man's mind.

          It'll change him. It might even

          come to define him.

Saito looks at Cobb.

                    SAITO

          My sources suggest you might not

          have always been so cautious.

                    COBB

          Then you need new sources, Mr.

          Saito.

Saito considers Cobb. Shrugs.

                    SAITO

          Fischer Morrow has the regulators

          in their pockets. We're the last

          company standing between them and

          total energy dominance and we can

          no longer compete. Soon they'll

          control the energy supply of half

          the world. They'll be able to

          blackmail governments, dictate

          policy. In effect, they become a

          new superpower. The world needs

          Robert Fischer to change his mind.

                    EAMES

          That's where we come in. How's

          Robert Fischer's relationship to

          his father?

                    SAITO

          Rumor is the relationship is

          complicated.

                    COBB

          We'll need more than rumor, Mr.

          Saito.

Eames picks up a photo: a distinguished executive (68).

                     EAMES

          Can you get me access to him?

          Browning. Fischer senior's right-

          hand man. Fischer junior's

          godfather.

                                                        49.

                    SAITO

          It should be possible. If you can

          get the right references.

                    EAMES

          References are something of a

          specialty for me, Mr. Saito.

EXT. DECREPIT BUILDING, MOMBASA - LATER

Eames leads Cobb and Saito down uneven steps to a doorway.

INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

Peeling paint, buzzing flies. They ascend to a dusty,

wire-reinforced glass door which Eames pushes open-

INT. PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS

Row upon row of wooden shelves holding hundreds of dusty

glass bottles of all shapes and colors. At the far end, a

portly 40-year-old man rises from behind his desk, beckoning.

This is YUSUF.

                    YUSUF

          Come, come.

Eames shakes Yusuf's hand. Yusuf stops at Cobb.

                    YUSUF

          Ah, yes. Mr. Cobb. I've heard so

          very much about you.

              (indicates chairs)

          please.

Yusuf chases a CAT off Saito's chair.

                    YUSUF

          Bloody cats.

Yusuf moves to a shelf and runs his fingers over the glass

bottles. None of them has a label.

                    YUSUF

          You work using Somnacin, I think,

          Mr. Cobb?

                    COBB

          You're well informed, Mr. Yusuf.

Yusuf places a bottle on the desk in front of Cobb.

                                                         50.

                    COBB

              (dubious)

          Somnacin?

                    YUSUF

              (proudly)

          Yusuf's Somnacin.

Yusuf pulls the stopper, holds it towards Cobb's nose.

                    COBB

          As good as the real thing?

Yusuf WHIPS the bottle away from Cobb, offended.

                       YUSUF

          Better.

Yusuf holds the bottle to the light, marveling.

                    YUSUF

          Binds the dreamers tight. Let's

          them dream as one. Makes it real.

          Of course, if you'd prefer, you

          could use Somnacin brand. If you

          could explain to the international

          control council what you wanted it

          for.

Yusuf puts the bottle back onto the shelf. Sits.

                    YUSUF

          You are seeking a chemist?

              (Cobb nods)

          To formulate compounds for a job?

                    COBB

          And to come into the held with us.

                    YUSUF

          I rarely go into the held, Mr.

          Cobb.

                    COBB

          We need you there to tailor

          compounds to our particular

          requirements.

                       YUSUF

          Which are?

                    COBB

          Great depth.

                    YUSUF

          A dream within a dream? Two levels?

                                                           51.

                      COBB

          Three.

                    YUSUF

          Not possible. That many dreams

          within dreams would be too

          unstable.

                    COBB

          I've done it before. You just have

          to add a sedative.

                    YUSUF

          A powerful sedative. How many team

          members?

                      COBB

          Five.

                      SAITO

          Six.

              (to Cobb)

          The only way to know you've done

          the job is if I go in with you.

                    COBB

          There's no room for tourists on

          these jobs, Mr. Saito.

                    SAITO

          This time, it would seem there is.

Cobb looks at him, uneasy. Yusuf pulls out another bottle.

                    YUSUF

          Of course. I use it every day.

Yusuf hands it to Cobb, who considers the white liquid

inside.

                      COBB

          For what?

Yusuf beckons them further into the pharmacy, to a METAL

DOOR. He STOPS- second thoughts.

                    YUSUF

          Perhaps... you will not want to

          see.

Cobb motions to continue. Yusuf pulls out a large key.

                                                        52.

INT. BACK ROOM, PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS

A dark room with ROWS of low COTS. Each with a sleeping

occupant. Tubes connect their wrists. An ELDERLY BALD MAN

watches over them.

                    EAMES

              (counting)

          Eighteen, twenty-all connected,

          bloody hell.

                    YUSUF

          They come every day. To share the

          dream.

Yusuf nods at the Elderly Bald Man, who moves to the nearest

bed. Reaches out to the OCCUPANT. Gives his face a FIRM SLAP.

The sleeper does not even stir.

                    YUSUF

          See? Very stable.

                    COBB

          How long do they dream?

                    YUSUF

          Three, four hours. Every day.

                    COBB

          How long in dream time?

                    YUSUF

          With this compound... about forty

          hours. Each and every day.

Saito surveys the room, appalled.

                    SAITO

          Why do they do it?

                    YUSUF

          Tell him, Mr. Cobb.

                    COBB

          After a while...

              (looks at Saito)

          It becomes the only way you can

          dream.

                    YUSUF

          Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?

Cobb STARES at the sleepers. Uneasy.

                    EAMES

          They come here every day to sleep?

                                                        53.

                       ELDERLY BALD MAN (O.S.)

          No.

Cobb turns to the Elderly Bald Man, who looks fondly at his

dreamers.

                    ELDERLY BALD MAN

          They come to be woken up... the

          dream has become their reality...

The Elderly Bald Man pokes a crooked finger at Cobb's chest.

                    ELDERLY BALD MAN

          And who are you to say otherwise?

Cobb STARES at the Elderly Bald Man. DISTURBED. Cobb turns to

Yusuf. TOSSES him the bottle.

                    COBB

          Let's see what you can do.

INT. SAME - MOMENTS LATER

Cobb is lying on an empty cot, asleep. Yusuf stands over him.

As we move in on Cobb's SLEEPING FACE we hear the sound of a

FREIGHT TRAIN, BUILDING, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT. WASTELAND - DAY

CLOSE ON Cobb's face as he lies, EYES CLOSED, cheek pressed

to a METAL RAIL- THE SOUND OF THE TRAIN IS DEAFENING- Cobb is

BREATHING, BREATHING, BREATHING, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. BACK ROOM, PHARMACY - DAY

Cobb's eyes open. Yusuf is watching him.

                       YUSUF

          Sharp, no?

Cobb nods. Gets to his feet, looking around-

INT. BATHROOM, PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS

Cobb SPLASHES water on his face, breathing hard- INSERT CUT:

A CURTAIN BILLOWS. MAL TURNS TO US, HAIR BLOWING, SMILING.

Cobb fumbles in his pockets, pulls out his spinning top. He

tries to set it spinning on the back edge of the sink, but it

FALLS to the floor and rolls towards the door- Saito is

there. WATCHING Cobb. He looks down at the spinning top.

                                                         54.

                    SAITO

          Everything alright, Mr. Cobb?

Cobb dries his face with a paper towel. Picks up his top.

                    COBB

          Everything's fine.

INT. BACK ROOM, WORKSHOP - NIGHT

Close on a small BRASS CHESS PIECE. Ariadne tips it over.

Frowning, she picks up a micro drill, peels back the felt on

the bottom and widens a hole in one side of its base. Tests

the TIPPING POINT again. A NOISE makes her look up.

INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

Ariadne comes into the main space. Someone is there,

unpacking one of the MECHANISMS. Cobb.

                    ARIADNE

          You're back.

Cobb looks up with a start. Caught out.

                    ARIADNE

          Are you going under on your own?

                    COBB

          I just-I need to test some things.

          I didn't realize anyone was here.

                    ARIADNE

          Just working on my totem.

Ariadne holds up the chess piece. Cobb reaches for it.

                    COBB

          Let me see-

Ariadne SNAPS it out of his reach. Smiles. Cobb nods.

                    COBB

          You're learning.

                    ARIADNE

          It's an elegant solution to keeping

          track of reality. Your invention?

                       COBB

          No. Mal's.

Cobb pulls out his spinning top. Looks at it.

                                                      55.

                    COBB

          This one was hers. She'd spin it in

          a dream and it would never topple.

          Just spin and spin...

                    ARIADNE

          Arthur told me she died.

                    COBB

          She did. How are the mazes coming?

Ariadne indicates three large ARCHITECTURAL MODELS.

                    ARIADNE

          Good. Each level relates to the

          part of the subject's subconscious

          we're trying to access. I'm making

          the bottom level a hospital, so

          that Fischer will bring his father

          there-

                    COBB

          Don't tell me. Remember, you only

          want the dreamer to know the

          layout.

                    ARIADNE

          Why's that so important?

                    COBB

          In case one of us brings in part of

          our subconscious. You wouldn't want

          any projections knowing the layout.

                    ARIADNE

          In case you bring Mal in.

Cobb says nothing.

                    ARIADNE

          You won't build yourself because if

          you know the maze, then she knows

          it. And she'd sabotage the

          operation. You can't keep her out,

          can you?

Cobb says nothing.

                    ARIADNE

          Do the others know?

                     COBB

          No.

                                                        56.

                    ARIADNE

          You have to warn them if it's

          getting worse-

                    COBB

              (gentle)

          I didn't say it's getting worse.

          Look, Ariadne, I need them for this

          job. I need you for this job.

          Without your help, I'll never get

          back to my children. And that's all

          I can care about right now.

                    ARIADNE

          Why can't you go home, Cobb?

Cobb looks at her, deciding what to say.

                    COBB

          They think I killed her.

                    ARIADNE

          How did she die?

Cobb thinks.

INSERT CUT: Mal, wind BLOWING her hair, smiles at Cobb. Now

we see Cobb- SHAKING HIS HEAD, TEARS STREAMING, BEGGING-

                       COBB

          Thank you.

                       ARIADNE

          For what?

                    COBB

          Not asking whether I did.

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

Ariadne, Arthur, Yusuf, Eames and Saito sit around the room,

looking at FILES. Cobb presides.

                    COBB

          The mark is Robert Fischer, heir to

          the Australian energy conglomerate,

          Fischer Morrow.

Cobb opens a large presentation pad.

                    COBB (reads aloud)

          "I WILL SPLIT UP MY FATHER'S

          EMPIRE."

Cobb turns to the team.

                                                  57.

                    COBB

          An idea Robert Fischer's conscious

          mind would never accept. We have to

          plant it deep in his subconscious.

                      ARTHUR

          How deep?

                    COBB

          Three levels down.

                    ARTHUR

          A dream within a dream within a

          dream? Is that even possible?

                    COBB

          Yes. It is.

                    COBB

          Now, the subconscious motivates

          through emotion, not reason, so we

          have to translate the idea into an

          emotional concept.

                    ARTHUR

          How do you translate a business

          strategy into an emotion?

                    COBB

          That's what we have to figure out.

          Robert and his father have a tense

          relationship. Worse, even, than the

          gossip columns have suggested...

                    EAMES

          Do you play on that? Suggest

          breaking up his father's company as

          a 'screw you' to the old man?

                    COBB

          No. Positive emotion trumps

          negative emotion every time. We

          yearn for people to be reconciled,

          for catharsis. We need positive

          emotional logic.

Eames thinks. Paces. Looking back at the board.

                    EAMES

          Try this... "MY FATHER ACCEPTS THAT

          I WANT TO CREATE FOR MYSELF, NOT

          FOLLOW IN HIS FOOTSTEPS."

                    COBB

          That might work.

                                                         58.

                    ARTHUR

          Might? We'll have to do better than

          that.

                    EAMES

          Thanks for the contribution,

          Arthur.

                    ARTHUR

          Forgive me for wanting a little

          specificity, Eames.

                    COBB

          Inception's not about specificity.

          When we get inside his head, we're

          going to have to work with what we

          find.

Arthur shrugs, frustrated. And we-

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - DAY

The team are in the middle of a DESERTED intersection.

Ariadne is showing Yusuf aspects of the geography.

                    EAMES

          We could split the idea into

          emotional triggers, and use one on

          each level.

                    COBB

          How do you mean?

                    EAMES

          On the top level, we open up his

          relationship with his father....

          Say: "I WILL NOT FOLLOW IN MY

          FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS." Next level

          down we've accessed his ambition

          and self-esteem. We feed him: "I

          WILL CREATE SOMETHING MYSELF."

          Then, the bottom level, we bring

          out the emotional big guns...

                    COBB

          "MY FATHER DOESN'T WANT ME TO BE

          HIM."

                    EAMES

          That could do it.

                    ARTHUR

          How do you produce these emotional

          triggers?

                                                        59.

                    EAMES

          I forge each emotional concept in

          the style and manner of Peter

          Browning, a key figure in Fischer's

          emotional life.

Two AFRICAN PEDESTRIANS wander into view.

                    ARTHUR

          Are those yours?

Eames shakes his head. Cobb turns to Yusuf.

                    ARTHUR

          Yusuf?

                    YUSUF

          Yup. Sorry.

                    COBB

          Suppress them. We don't bring our

          own projections into the dream-we

          let Fischer's subconscious supply

          the people.

                    EAMES

          Saito, when do I get to see

          Browning?

                    SAITO

          You fly out to Sydney on Tuesday.

          We've arranged for you to spend

          several days...

INT. ANTEROOM, MAURICE FISCHER'S OFFICE - DAY

Eames sits in the crowded room. Boxes and files are piled

high. Browning stands by a pair of double doors.

                    SAITO (V.O.)

          ...as part of a consulting

          litigation team working for

          Browning.

                    BROWNING

          I'm not smelling settlement here-we

          take them down.

                    LAWYER

          Mr. Browning, Maurice Fischer's

          policy is always one of avoiding

          litigation-

Browning turns to the lawyer. Calm, but POWERFUL.

                                                           60.

                    BROWNING

          Shall we relay your concerns

          directly to Maurice?

Browning opens the doors to Maurice Fischer's inner office.

Eames leans in to watch as Browning beckons the Lawyer into-

INT. MAURICE FISCHER'S INNER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

The office is a MAKESHIFT HOSPITAL ROOM: a BED where the desk

should be. Browning addresses a figure at the window. ROBERT

FISCHER, 30'S, abstracted.

                       BROWNING

          How is he?

Fischer turns to Browning. Motions silence, as he glances at

his FATHER in the bed. Wheezing gently.

                    BROWNING

          I don't want to bother him

          unnecessarily but I know he-

                     FATHER

          Robert! I've told you to keep out

          the damn!-

MAURICE LASHES OUT, KNOCKING things from his bedside table. A

NURSE calms Maurice as Fischer crouches to retrieve a FRAMED

PHOTOGRAPH. He looks at the photo through the broken glass- a

YOUNG BOY holds a PINWHEEL CLEARLY MADE BY A CHILD (each of

the points is numbered in pen), his FATHER blows on it.

                    BROWNING

          Must be a cherished memory of his-

                    FISCHER

          I put it by his bed. He hasn't even

          noticed.

                    BROWNING

          Robert, we have to talk about a

          power of attorney. I know this is

          hard for you, but it's important

          that we start to think about the

          future-

                    FISCHER

          Not now, Uncle Peter.

Browning looks at Fischer, considering. Biding his time.

                    EAMES (V.O.)

          The vultures are circling. The

          sicker Maurice Fischer becomes, the

          stronger Peter Browning becomes...

                                                         61.

Eames WATCHES Browning, STUDYING his every move .

INT. BATHROOM - DAY

Eames gestures at a mirror, as if offering to shake hands...

                    EAMES (V.O.)

          I've had time to learn Browning's

          physical presence and mannerisms...

In the mirror: BROWNING GESTURES BACK.

INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

                    EAMES

          Now, in the dream, I can impersonate

          Browning and suggest the concepts to

          Fischer's conscious mind...

              (draws a diagram)

          Then we take Fischer down another

          level and his own subconscious

          feeds it right back to him.

                    ARTHUR

              (impressed)

          So he gives himself the idea.

                    EAMES

          Precisely. That's the only way

          to make it stick. It has to seem

          self-generated.

                    ARTHUR

          Eames, I'm impressed.

                    EAMES

          Your condescension, as always, is

          much appreciated, Arthur.

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. DESERTED HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

The team sit on the steps of the large marble lobby,

debating. Ariadne is showing Arthur the lobby.

                    EAMES

          He's not scheduled for surgery, no

          dental, nothing.

                    COBB

          I thought he had some knee thing?

                    EAMES

          Nothing they'd put him under for.

          Besides, we need a good ten hours.

                                                        62.

          Sydney to Los Angeles.

They turn to Saito.

                    SAITO

          Twelve hours and forty-five

          minutes-one of the longest flights

          in the world. He makes it every two

          weeks...

EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY

Fischer steps out of a black town car and walks across the

tarmac towards a GULF STREAM JET, accompanied by two aides.

                    COBB (V.O.)

          Surely he flies private?

                    SAITO (V.O.)

          Not if there were unexpected

          maintenance with his plane.

Fischer is met at the steps by a DISTRAUGHT FLIGHT OFFICER.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

Cobb chews this over. Arthur comes over.

                    ARTHUR

          It'd have to be a 747.

                      COBB

          Why?

                     ARTHUR

          On a 747 the pilots are up above,

          first class is in the nose so

          nobody walks through the cabin.

          We'd have to buyout the whole

          cabin, and the first class flight

          attendant-

                    SAITO

          We bought the airline.

Everyone turns to Saito.

                    SAITO

          It seemed... neater.

                    COBB

          Neater, huh?

              (gets to his feet)

          Well, now we have ten uninterrupted

          hours.

          Nice lobby, by the way.

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

The group is back in the workshop, deep in discussion.

                    ARTHUR

          My question is how we go down three

          layers with enough stability. Three

          layers down a little turbulence is

          gonna translate into an earthquake.

          The dreams are gonna collapse with

          the slightest disturbance.

Yusuf clears his throat.

                    YUSUF

          Sedation. For sleep stable enough to

          create three layers of dreaming...

INT. MAKESHIFT LAB - DAY

Yusuf depresses a plunger. Arthur is SLEEPING in a chair.

                    YUSUF (V.O.)

          We will have to combine it with an

          extremely powerful sedative....

Eames SLAPS Arthur, HARD. Arthur does not stir.

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

Arthur unconsciously rubs his cheek.

                    YUSUF

          The compound we'll be using to

          share the dream is an advanced

          Somnacin derivative. It creates a

          very clear connection between

          dreamers, whilst actually

          accelerating brain function.

          Buying us more time in each level.

          Brain function in the dream will be

          about twenty times normal.

          How much time?

          Three dreams... that's ten hours,

          twenty...

                    EAMES

          Math was never my strong suit.

                    COBB

          It's basically a week one layer

          down, six months two layers down-

                    ARIADNE

          And ten years in the third level.

          Depends on the dream.

                     EAMES

          It's not going to take us long to

          crack Fischer open once we get

          going. We'll be out in a couple

          days, max.

                     ARTHUR

          How do we get out once we've made

          the plant?

              (to Cobb)

          I hope you've got something a

          little more elegant in mind than

          shooting me in the head like last

          time.

Arthur tilts back in his chair. Yusuf turns to Cobb.

                    COBB

          A kick.

                    ARIADNE

          What's a kick?

Eames slips his foot under Arthur's chair leg. TIPS it-

Arthur's legs SHOOT UP INSTINCTIVELY for balance-

                    EAMES

          That, Ariadne, would be a kick.

                                                          65.

                    COBB

          That feeling of falling which snaps

          you awake. We use that to jolt

          ourselves awake once we're done.

                    ARTHUR

          But how are we going to feel that

          through the sedation?

                    YUSUF

          That's the clever part. I customize

          the sedative...

INT. MAKESHIFT LAB - DAY

Cobb, Eames and Yusuf watch Arthur, ASLEEP, in a chair.

                    YUSUF (O.S.)

          To leave inner ear function

          unimpaired...

Yusuf, with a wicked grin, slowly TIPS Arthur's chair

backwards... as he falls, Arthur's body JERKS, EYES OPENING

just before he HITS the floor.

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

Arthur thinks, nodding slowly.

                    YUSUF

          That way, however deep the sleep, the

          sleeper will still feel falling...

INT. MAKESHIFT LAB - DAY

Yusuf gleefully LEANS a SLEEPING ARTHUR to one side ...

                    YUSUF (V.O.)

          Or tipping...

Arthur goes down with a CRASH, JERKING AWAKE-

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

Arthur thinks this through.

                    ARTHUR

          Even that won't cut through three

          layers of deep sleep.

                    COBB

          The trick is to devise a kick for

          each level, then synchronize them

          to get a snap that penetrates all

          three layers.

                                                        66.

Arthur looks at Cobb, getting it.

                    ARTHUR

          We can use the musical countdown to

          synchronize the different kicks.

INT. WORKSHOP - NIGHT

Ariadne comes into the darkened main space. Cobb is lying on

one of the chairs, asleep. Plugged into the mechanism.

Ariadne stands over him. Watching.

She opens the case, PULLS one of the tubes, sits, checking

the dials as she injects the needle cap into her arm, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR - DAY

Ariadne ascends. She looks at the buttons. Spots the "B." The

elevator STOPS. She looks through the grill at-

INT. YOUNG GIRL'S BEDROOM - DAY

Ariadne pulls back the grill and walks across the room,

considering the dusty furnishings. At the window is a doll's

house, front slightly ajar. Ariadne opens it. Inside is a

SAFE. She tries it. LOCKED. A NOISE STARTLES her- she turns,

looking through a doorway into another room...

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Ariadne looks into the room to see Cobb and Mal talking,

arguing. A private moment. Mal brushes at Cobb's hair, trying

to convince him. We hear snatches of conversation-

                     MAL

          You remember when you asked me to

          marry you?

                    COBB

          Of course...

                    MAL

          You said you had a dream...

                    COBB

          That we'd grow old together.

                    MAL

          And we can. You know how to find

          me... you know what you have to do.

Cobb is shaking his head, gently. Mal looks into Cobb's eyes-

gentle, loving... Mal SPOTS Ariadne spying on them.

                                                          67.

FREEZES, staring, hostile. Cobb turns, sees Ariadne, moves

towards her, leaving Mal.

                    COBB

          You shouldn't be in here.

Cobb guides her back into the elevator.

                    ARIADNE

          I wanted to know what "tests" you

          need to do on your own every night.

INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR - DAY

Cobb shuts the CAGE DOOR. Ariadne hits a button. The elevator

RISES. Through the GRILL Ariadne can see a BEACH stretching

off into the distance. The elevator stops. Mal sits on the

sand. Beside her, the two children are crouched, away from

us, building a SANDCASTLE.

                    ARIADNE

          Why do you do this to yourself?

                    COBB

          This is the only way I can still

          dream.

                    ARIADNE

          Is it so important to dream?

Cobb stares at his family.

                    COBB

          In my dreams... we're still together.

The kids, WITHOUT TURNING AROUND, jump up and RUN AWAY.

INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

The elevator descends.

                    ARIADNE

          But these aren't just dreams, are

          they? They're memories. You said

          never to use memories.

                    COBB

          And I shouldn't.

                    ARIADNE

          You're keeping her alive.

                    COBB

          No.

                                                          68.

                    ARIADNE

          You can't let her go.

                    COBB

          No. These are moments I regret.

          Moments I turned into dreams so I

          could change them.

Ariadne's fingers move across the buttons- stop at the "B."

                    ARIADNE

          What've you got buried down there

          that you regret?

Cobb pushes her hand away. Hits the third floor button.

                    COBB

          There's only one thing I need you

          to understand about me...

INT. KITCHEN, COBB AND MAL'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Ariadne follows Cobb into the kitchen. A THIN MAN is there,

standing by the table. He holds a FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER.

                    ARIADNE

          This is your house?

                    COBB

          Mine and Mal's.

                    ARIADNE

          Where is she?

                    COBB

          She'd already died.

The Thin Man offers Cobb the piece of paper. A CHILD'S SHOUT-

Cobb TURNS. Ariadne follows his gaze to the garden. A small

blonde boy faces away from them, crouched on his haunches to

look at something on the ground.

                    COBB

          It's James. My boy. He's found

          something. Maybe a worm.

A slightly older girl RUNS into view.

                    COBB

          And there's Philippa.

She crouches beside the boy. Their FACES ARE AWAY FROM US.

They point and discuss whatever is on the ground.

                                                        69.

                    COBB

          I thought about calling out, so

          they'd turn and smile those

          incredible smiles... but I'm out of

          time-

The Thin Man thrusts the paper into Cobb's hand.

                    THIN MAN

          Right now. Or never, Cobb.

Cobb nods, turns from the window-

                    COBB

          Then I panic that I'll always wish

          I'd seen them turn, that I can't

          waste this chance...

Cobb TURNS BACK to call out- but the children RACE OFF...

                    COBB

          But the moment's passed. And

          whatever I do, the dream's always

          the same... When I'm about to

          call... they run.

Cobb watches them run off, calling for grandma, FACES UNSEEN.

                    COBB

          If I'm going to see their faces

          again-I've got to get back here in

          the real world...

Behind him, Ariadne SLAMS the grill shut. Cobb TURNS.

INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Ariadne hits the BASEMENT button. The elevator starts to

DESCEND. ariadne STARES, fascinated as glimpses of floors

slip past: Mal's childhood bedroom, a thundering wall of

freight train... The elevator STOPS. Through the grill

Ariadne sees a HOTEL SUITE. She pulls open the grill, steps

cautiously out into-

INT. ELEGANT HOTEL SUITE - CONTINUOUS (NOW NIGHT)

DISHEVELED bedclothes, UPENDED room service table,

STRAWBERRIES across the floor. A STRUGGLE. Ariadne steps

forwards- SMASH- she looks down to see that she has kicked

over a CHAMPAGNE FLUTE. Ariadne feels a draught. The CURTAIN

BILLOWS.

                    MAL (O.S.)

          What are you doing here?

Ariadne TURNS. Mal is there.

                                                        70.

                    ARIADNE

          My name is-

                    MAL

          I know who you are. What are you

          doing here?

                    ARIADNE

          I don't know. Trying to understand.

                    MAL

          How could you understand? Do you

          know what it is to be a lover? To

          be half of a whole?

                    ARIADNE

          No.

Mal moves slowly towards Ariadne...

                    MAL

          I'll tell you a riddle. You're

          waiting for a train. A train that

          will take you far away. You know

          where you hope this train will take

          you, but you don't know for sure...

Mal glides around Ariadne, looking her over.

                    MAL

          But... it doesn't matter. How can

          it not matter to you where that

          train will take you?

                    COBB (O.S.)

          Because you'll be together.

Cobb is standing in the elevator. Mal nods. Looks at him.

                    MAL

          How could you bring her here, Dom?

                    ARIADNE

          What is this place?

                    COBB

          A hotel. We spent our anniversaries

          in this suite.

                    ARIADNE

          What happened here?

Mal picks up the BROKEN STEM of a champagne flute...

                                                        71.

INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Cobb PULLS Ariadne into the elevator- Mal THROWS herself

towards Ariadne- Cobb SLAMS the GRILL- Mal SMASHES against it

AGAIN and AGAIN like a WILD ANIMAL- Ariadne FLINCHES-

                     MAL

          you PROMISED! YOU SAID WE'D BE

          TOGETHER!-

                    COBB

          We can. We will. But I need you to

          stay here for now-

                    MAL

          YOU SAID WE'D GROW OLD TOGETHER!-

Cobb pushes a button and the elevator starts to rise.

                    COBB

          I'll come back. I need you to stay

          here on your own for now. Just

          while I do this job. Then we can be

          together-

                    MAL

          WE'LL BE TOGETHER-YOU PROMISED!-

Mal THROWS herself against the grill, and. we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. WORKSHOP - NIGHT

Ariadne watches Cobb sleeping. His eyes gradually flicker

open. He sees her watching him.

                    ARIADNE

          You think you can just build a

          prison of memories to lock her in?

          You think that's going to contain

          her?

The LIGHTS COME ON: Saito and Arthur stand in the doorway.

                    SAITO

          Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.

                    COBB

          When's the funeral?

                    SAITO

          Thursday. In Los Angeles.

                                                        72.

                    COBB

          Robert'll accompany the body

          Tuesday at the outside. We have to

          move.

Cobb gets up. Ariadne comes over to him.

                    ARIADNE

              (low)

          I'm coming with you.

                    COBB

          No. I promised Miles.

                    ARIADNE

          The team needs someone in there who

          understands what you're struggling

          with. If you don't want it to be me

          then you need to show Arthur what I

          just saw.

Cobb looks at Ariadne. Turns to Saito.

                    COBB

          We need one more seat on the plane.

INT. DEPARTURE GATE, SYDNEY - DAY

Saito stands looking out the window at a 747. Cobb arrives

beside him. They watch a COFFIN being loaded.

                    COBB

          If I get on this plane and you

          haven't taken care of things...

          when we land I go to jail for the

          rest of my life.

                    SAITO

          Complete the job en route, I make

          one phone call from the plane...

          you will have no trouble clearing

          immigration.

INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN, 747 - CONTINUOUS

The luxurious cabin has only ten seats. Cobb finds his- sees

Ariadne in the seat behind his. They do not acknowledge each

other. Behind her is Arthur, looking out the window. Eames

enters, STUFFS his bag into the overhead bin, BLOCKING the

passenger behind: ROBERT FISCHER, standing there, patient,

bag in hand, wearing black.

                       EAMES

          Oh, sorry.

                                                          73.

Eames SQUEEZES up against his seat to let Fischer BRUSH PAST.

Fischer moves to his seat, directly in front of Cobb. Eames

TOSSES Cobb a PASSPORT. Cobb flips it open: Fischer's.

Pockets it. Yusuf and Saito enter, take their seats.

EXT. RUNWAY - MOMENTS LATER

The 747 HURTLES down the runway.

INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN, 747 - MOMENTS LATER

Cobb looks down at his hand: a TINY VIAL taped to the center

of his palm. He removes the cap. The seatbelt sign goes dark.

Cobb unbuckles, stands.

                       COBB

          Excuse me?

Fischer looks up.

                       FISCHER

          Yes?

                    COBB

          I think this is yours...

Cobb holds up the open passport, comparing the picture to

Fischer. Fischer's hand goes to his pocket. Cobb hands

Fischer the passport.

                    FLIGHT ATTENDANT

          Would you gentlemen care for a

          drink?

                       FISCHER

          Water.

                       COBB

          Same.

Fischer gives Cobb a thin smile. Holds up his passport.

                    FISCHER

          Well, thank you.

                    COBB

          No problem. Look, I couldn't help

          noticing your name. You're not

          related to Maurice Fischer?

Fischer takes a beat. But Cobb seems harmless.

                    FISCHER

          Actually, he was my father.

                                                        74.

                    COBB

          I'm very sorry for your loss. He

          was an inspiring figure.

The Flight Attendant brings their drinks- Cobb takes them.

                    COBB

          Thanks.

As he turns to Fischer he LOWERS his right hand ... a CLEAR

LIQUID DROPS into Fischer's water as Cobb hands it to him.

                    COBB

          To Maurice Fischer.

              (they drink)

          I'll leave you in peace.

Fischer grants him a smile.

EXT. 747 - LATER

The great plane SOARS through a burning cloudscape.

INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN, 747 - MOMENTS LATER

Cobb reaches into the overhead for a blanket- lets it fall

onto Fischer's head- Fischer doesn't flinch. ASLEEP. Cobb

SIGNALS the others. The First Flight Attendant unlocks a

CUPBOARD in the galley, then leaves, closing the curtain.

Arthur moves into the galley and pulls out a MECHANISM CASE.

Cobb and Arthur open the mechanism- uncoil the tubes- feed

them around the window side of each of the seats. Arthur

rolls up Fischer's cuff- PUSHES the needle cap into Fischer's

wrist. Arthur pulls Fischer's cuff down and hides the tubes

behind the armrest of Fischer's seat.

Arthur runs the next tube to Ariadne. Cobb puts the case on

Yusuf's lap. Yusuf checks the TIMERS, tapping the syringes.

The others recline their seats. Yusuf HITS A BUTTON- closes

the case- places it at his feet. He settles back, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. SEDAN - DAY

Cobb DRIVES. Saito and Arthur are in the back. Rain BEATS

down. Cobb pulls over-

EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - CONTINUOUS

Yusuf stands on the corner, silver briefcase in hand, collar

turned up against the rain. He reaches for the door.

                                                          75.

INT. SEDAN - CONTINUOUS

Yusuf clambers into the back, brushing rain from his face.

                    ARTHUR

              (indicates rain)

          Couldn't you have peed before you

          went under?

                       YUSUF

          Sorry.

The front door OPENS and Eames climbs in, soaked.

                    EAMES

          Bit too much free champagne before

          takeoff, Yusuf?

                    YUSUF

          Ha bloody ha.

                    COBB

          At least we know he'll be looking

          for a cab in this.

INT./EXT. SEDAN ON RAINY NEW YORK STREETS - CONTINUOUS

Cobb pulls out into the heavy traffic. He weaves around

several cars before lining up behind a YELLOW CAB.

                    COBB

          Brace yourselves.

Cobb hits the gas- REAR ENDS the cab with a CRUNCH. The

CABDRIVER gets out, fuming. Heads to Cobb's window-

                    CABDRIVER

          Hey, asshole! Why don't you try

          driving without your thumb up-

He sees the SILENCED PISTOL Cobb is holding at his belly.

                       COBB

          Walk away.

The Cabdriver backs off. Arthur climbs into the cab. Both

cars pull away.

INT./EXT. CAB ON RAINY NEW YORK STREETS - CONTINUOUS

Arthur SLOWS in front of the TRAIN STATION, peering at the

pedes pedestrians. He SPOTS Fischer, lights the cab's sign.

Fischer FLAGS him down. Fischer JUMPS into the back, brushing

rain from his shoulders.

                                                           76.

                    FISCHER

          Third and Market. Snappy.

Eames JUMPS in from the other side.

                    FISCHER

          What're you doing?

                    EAMES

          Sorry, I thought it was free. Maybe

          we could share.

                       FISCHER

          Maybe not.

Saito gets into the front passenger seat. Pointing a gun.

                       FISCHER

          Great.

Arthur pulls away. Fischer pulls out his wallet and tosses it

at Eames.

                    FISCHER

              (contemptuous)

          There's 500 dollars in there. And

          the wallet's worth more than that.

          For that you ought to at least drop

          me at my stop.

Eames smiles at this.

                    EAMES

          I'm afraid-

A SHOT SHATTERS the window by Eames's head- another SHOT

IMPACTS by Saito-

                    EAMES

          Get us out of here!

Arthur hits the gas, but a BLACK S.U.V. SKIDS sideways in

front, BLOCKING the path-

A BLOCK BEHIND- Cobb is at a light. ARIADNE is getting in the

front. Cobb has HEARD the GUNFIRE-

                       COBB

          Come on!-

Cobb looks ahead to the AMBUSH, hits the gas- the sedan

ROCKETS forwards... but BAM- A FREIGHT TRAIN CLIPS THE FRONT

OF THE SEDAN, SHOVING IT SIDEWAYS AS AN ENDLESS TRAIN BARRELS

PAST, A WALL BETWEEN COBB AND THE AMBUSH-

                                                           77.

A SECOND S.U.V. is behind the cab- PLAIN CLOTHES SECURITY MEN

advance through the traffic, weapons trained on the cab.

Bullets RIP into the cab as Eames throws himself on top of

Fischer, PULLING a SACK over his head-

Inside the sedan, Ariadne watches the train passing-

                    ARIADNE

          This wasn't in the design-

Cobb BACKS UP, SPINS around, heading for the tail of the

train-

A Security Man emerges from the front S.U.V. carrying an

AUTOMATIC RIFLE- he steps towards the cab through the rain,

raises his weapon and BLASTS THE CAB'S WINDSCREEN-

Cobb clears the end of the train, and SKIDS across the tracks-

Arthur CROUCHES down- PUSHES the accelerator with his HAND-

YANKS the wheel- FLYING BLIND. The cab NAILS the Security

Man, CRUNCHING into the front S.U.V.-

Cobb SMASHES his car into the rear S.U.V., creating a GAP-

Arthur YANKS the transmission and REVERSES- SCRAPING through

the gap- Security Men DIVE out of the way- Arthur throws a

ragged J-turn to head down a SIDE STREET- Cobb follows in the

other car. Rain whips across Arthur's face as he BREATHES-

                    ARTHUR

          Everybody okay? Saito?

Arthur looks at Saito. Saito's hand is at his belly. Covered

in BLOOD.

EXT. WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

The sedan and cab pull into the side entrance- Eames jumps

out- PULLS the shutter down behind them-

INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Yusuf and Eames PULL Fischer from the cab, HUSTLING him

through a doorway. Cobb JUMPS out of the sedan, furious.

                    COBB

          Arthur! Arthur what the-

Arthur pulls the bloody Saito from the front seat.

                    COBB

          Oh, Christ. Is he dying?

                                        78.

          ARTHUR

I don't know. What happened back

there? Where were you?

          COBB

We were blocked by a freight train.

          ARTHUR

    (to Ariadne)

Why would you put a train crossing

in a downtown intersection?

             ARIADNE

I didn't.

          COBB

    (snaps)

Why were we all ambushed, Arthur?!

Those weren't regular projections-

they'd been trained!

          ARIADNE

How could they be trained?

          ARTHUR

Fischer's had an extractor teach

his mind to defend itself. His

subconscious is militarized. It

should've shown on the research-

          COBB

So why the hell didn't it?!

             ARTHUR

Calm down.

          COBB

Don't tell me to calm down-you were

meant to check Fischer's background

thoroughly. You can't make this

kind of mistake-we're not prepared

for this kind of violence-

          ARTHUR

Cobb, we've dealt with sub-security

before. We just have to be more-

          COBB

This wasn't part of the plan, Arthur!

    (points at Saito)

He's dying!

          EAMES

So we put him out of his misery.

                                                          79.

Eames steps into the room, pulls his gun and moves over

Saito.

                    COBB

          No.

                    EAMES

          He's in agony. Let's wake him up-

Cobb GRABS Eames's arm.

                    COBB

          No!

              (they lock eyes)

          It won't wake him up.

                    EAMES

          What do you mean, it won't wake

          him? When you die in a dream you

          wake up.

                    YUSUF

          Not from this. We're too heavily

          sedated to wake up that way.

Eames looks at Yusuf, then to Cobb.

                    EAMES

          So what happens if one of us dies?

                    COBB

          That person doesn't wake up. Their

          mind drops into Limbo.

                    ARIADNE

          Limbo?

                    ARTHUR

          Unconstructed dream space.

                    ARIADNE

          What's down there?

                    ARTHUR

          Raw, infinite subconscious. Nothing

          there but what was left behind by

          anyone on the team who's been trapped

          there before. On this team... just

          Cobb.

                    ARIADNE

          How long would we be stuck there?

                                                        80.

                    YUSUF

          You couldn't even think about

          trying to escape until the sedation

          eases-

                      EAMES

          How long?

                    YUSUF

          Decades-it could be infinite-I

          don't know! Ask him-he's the one

          who's been there before!

Eames moves to Cobb. Looks him in the eye.

                    EAMES

          Great. So now we're stuck in

          Fischer's mind battling it out with

          his private army, and if we get hit

          we're stuck in Limbo 'til our

          brains dissolve into scrambled egg?

Cobb says nothing. Saito groans more loudly.

                    ARTHUR

          Let's just get him upstairs.

INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Saito is laid out on an old desk. Arthur examines him. He

motions to Ariadne. Eames watches Cobb.

                    ARTHUR

          Hold this. Firm pressure.

Arthur turns to Cobb.

                    ARTHUR

          You knew the risks and you didn't

          tell us.

                    COBB

          There wasn't meant to be any risk.

          We weren't supposed to be dealing

          with a load of gunnre.

                    ARTHUR

          You had no right.

                    COBB

          It's the only way you can go three

          layers deep, Arthur.

Arthur turns to Yusuf, hostile.

                                                81.

                    ARTHUR

          And you. You went along with this?

                    YUSUF

          I trusted him.

                    ARTHUR

          You trusted him? When? When he

          promised you half his share?

                    YUSUF

              (offended)

          No! His whole share. Plus, he told

          me he'd done it before.

Arthur turns to Cobb.

                    ARTHUR

          Oh, yeah? With Mal? That worked out

          great, didn't it, Cobb?

Cobb grabs Arthur.

                    COBB

          You don't know anything about that.

          This was the only way to do this

          job, Arthur. I did what I had to do

          to get back to my children.

                    EAMES

          So you led us into a war zone with

          no way out.

                    COBB

          We have a way out. The kick. We

          just have to push on, do the job as

          fast as possible and get out using

          the kick.

                    EAMES

          Forget it. We go any deeper, we

          just raise the stakes. I'm sitting

          it out on this level.

                    COBB

          You'll never make it, Eames.

          Fischer's security is surrounding

          this place as we speak. The ten

          hours of the flight is a week at

          this level-you'll never make it

          without getting killed. Downwards

          is the only way forwards. We have

          to carry on.

Saito groans. Cobb looks at him-

                                                           82.

                    COBB

          And we have to do it fast.

Eames and Arthur weigh this.

                    COBB

          Eames, go get ready. Arthur, let's

          get in there and soften him up.

INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE - LATER

Cobb and Arthur, wearing BALACLAVAS, PULL the sack from

Fischer's head. He is chained to the radiator.

                    FISCHER

          I'm insured against kidnapping up

          to ten million-this'll be simple-

                    COBB

          No, it won't.

Fischer looks at Cobb, unnerved.

                    ARTHUR

          In. your lather's office, below the

          bookshelves, is his personal safe.

          We need the combination.

                    FISCHER

          I never noticed a safe-

                    COBB

          Doesn't mean you don't know the

          combination.

                    FISCHER

          Well, I don't.

                    ARTHUR

          We have it on good authority that

          you do.

                    FISCHER

          Whose?

INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Yusuf looks through Fischer's wallet. Eames is opening a

HINGED, THREE-WING MIRROR.

                    YUSUF

          Five hundred dollars, this cost?

                    EAMES

          What's inside?

                                                        83.

                    YUSUF

          Cash, cards, ID... and this-

Yusuf holds up a SNAPSHOT: the photo from Maurice Fischer's

office- YOUNG ROBERT holds his HOMEMADE PINWHEEL, his FATHER

blows on it. Eames takes it from Yusuf. STUDIES it. Cobb

enters. Eames hands him the snapshot.

                    EAMES

          Useful?

Cobb studies the snapshot. Eames examines himself in the

hinged mirror from multiple angles: ONE BY ONE the myriad

Eames reflections BECOME BROWNINGS. Cobb pockets the photo.

                    COBB

          You're on. You've got an hour.

                    EAMES

          An hour? I was supposed to have all

          night to crack him.

                    COBB

          And Saito was supposed to keep his

          guts on the inside. You've got an

          hour-get something we can use.

Eames turns from the mirror AS BROWNING. He glances at his

watch, then SCREAMS, as if begging for mercy-

INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Browning's CRY reverberates- Fischer looks up, concerned-

                    FISCHER

          What's that?

                    ARTHUR

          Good authority.

Another cry rings out. Fischer recognizes the voice.

                    FISCHER

          Uncle Peter?! Make them stop-

                    ARTHUR

          The combination.

                    FISCHER

          I don't know it!

                    ARTHUR

          Why would Browning tell us you did?

                    FISCHER

          Let me talk to him-I'll find out.

                                                        84.

INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Cobb pushes Browning (Eames), bloody and bruised, into the

room and forces him down next to Fischer. Cobb handcuffs

Browning's wrist to a metal bracket on the side of the sink.

                    COBB

          You've got an hour. Get talking.

Cobb leaves.

                    BROWNING (EAMES)

          They've had me for two days.

          They've got someone with access to

          your father's office and they're

          trying to open his safe-they

          thought I'd know the combination,

          but I don't-

                    FISCHER

          Neither do I, Uncle Peter.

                    BROWNING

              (confused)

          Maurice told me that after he

          passed only you would be able to

          open it.

                    FISCHER

          He never gave me the combination.

Browning thinks for a minute. Realizes something.

                    BROWNING

          He did, he just didn't tell you

          that it was a combination.

                    FISCHER

          What, then?

                    BROWNING

          Something only you would know. Some

          meaningful combination of numbers

          from your experiences with Maurice-

                    FISCHER

          We didn't have a lot of meaningful

          experiences together.

                    BROWNING

          Perhaps after your mother died...

                    FISCHER

          After my mother died, I went to him

          in my grief.

                    (MORE)

                                                        85.

                    FISCHER (CONT'D)

          You know what he told me? "There's

          really nothing to be said, Robert."

                     BROWNING

          He always had a hard time with

          emotional-

                    FISCHER

          I was eleven, Uncle Peter.

Browning (Eames) takes this in.

                    BROWNING

          He loved you, Robert. In his way.

                    FISCHER

          "In his way?" At the end he called

          me to his deathbed. He could barely

          speak, but he took the trouble to

          say one last thing to me. He pulled

          me close... I could make out only

          one word. "Disappointed."

Browning can say nothing.

INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Cobb pulls off his balaclava. Looks down at Saito, who is

breathing fast, shallow.

                    COBB

          How's he doing?

                    ARIADNE

          He's in a lot of pain.

Cobb takes Saito's hand. Looks him in the eye.

                    COBB

          When we get you down to the next

          level, the pain will be less

          intense.

Saito nods, breathing hard.

                    ARIADNE

              (low)

          And if he dies?

                    COBB

          His conscious mind will drop out of

          the dream. He'll be trapped in

          Limbo for a lifetime...

                    ARIADNE

          What will that do to him?

                                                           86.

Cobb looks at her. Grave.

                    COBB

          When he wakes... his mind could be

          completely gone.

                    SAITO

          When... when we wake I will still

          honor our arrangement...

Cobb looks down at Saito sadly.

                    COBB

          Saito-san, when you wake you might

          not even remember that we had an

          arrangement. You'll have forgotten

          this world. Limbo will be your

          reality. Lost there so long, you'll

          have become an old man...

                    SAITO

          Filled with regret?

                    COBB

          Waiting to die alone. Yes.

                    SAITO

          Then I'll take the chance and come

          back. And we'll be young men

          together again.

Saito smiles weakly. Cobb nods at him, turns to Ariadne.

                    ARIADNE

          When were you trapped in Limbo?

Cobb says nothing. Ariadne pulls him away from Saito.

                    ARIADNE

          Cobb, you might have convinced the

          rest of this team to carry on with

          the job. But they don't know the

          truth.

                    COBB

          What truth?

                    ARIADNE

          The truth that at any minute you

          might bring a freight train through

          the wall. The truth that Mal is

          bursting up through your

          subconscious.

                                                         87.

                    ARIADNE (CONT'D)

          The truth that as we go deeper into

          Fischer, we're also going deeper

          into you-and I'm not sure we're

          going to like what we find there.

Cobb stares back at Ariadne. Saying nothing.

                    ARIADNE

          This is not just about Fischer,

          it's about you. Tell me what

          happened to you and Mal. Trapped in

          Limbo.

Cobb looks at her. Thinking it through.

                    COBB

          We were on a job. Exploring dreams

          within dreams. But we didn't

          understand how your mind can turn

          hours into years. How you can get

          trapped. Trapped so deep that when

          you wash up on the shore of your

          subconscious...

SKY, WAVES WASHING OVER HER...

                    COBB

          You can lose track of what's real.

                    ARIADNE

          How long were you stuck?

Cobb pauses before he answers. Looks at Ariadne.

                    COBB

          Fifty years.

Ariadne stares at him, incredulous.

                    ARIADNE

          How did you stand it?

                    COBB

          It's not so bad at first, being

          gods. The problem is knowing that

          it's not real. It became impossible

          for me to live like that.

                                                        88.

                    ARIADNE

          But not for her?

                    COBB

          She accepted it. At some point...

INT. MAL'S CHILDHOOD HOME - DAY

Mal opens a DOLL'S HOUSE. Inside is a SAFE. She opens it- it

is empty. She pulls out her SPINNING TOP.

                    COBB (V.O.)

          ...she'd decided to forget that our

          world wasn't real.

Mal places the top inside the safe. LOCKS IT AWAY...

INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

                    ARIADNE

          And when you finally woke up?

                    COBB

          To wake from that. From decades

          lived. To be old souls thrown back

          into youth. It was hard. At first

          Mal seemed okay. But I started to

          realize something was wrong.

          Finally she admitted it. This idea

          she was possessed by. This simple

          little idea that changed

          everything...

                    ARIADNE

          What was it?

                    COBB

          That our world was not real. No

          matter what I did, no matter what I

          said, she was convinced that we

          were still in a dream. That we

          needed to wake up again...

INT. COBB AND MAL'S KITCHEN - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Cobb is trying to calm Mal, who is hysterical.

                     COBB (V.O.)

          That to get home we'd have to kill

          ourselves.

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

Ariadne looks at Cobb, appalled.

                                                          89.

                    ARIADNE

          What about your children?

Cobb has to look away.

                    COBB

          She... she believed they weren't

          real. That our real children were

          waiting. Somewhere above...

INT. COBB AND MAL'S KITCHEN - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Mal shakes her head at Cobb as he USHERS the children out of

the room, FACES UNSEEN-

                    COBB

          Calm down, Mal-

                    MAL

          They're projections, Dom. Your

          dreams. I'm their mother-don't you

          think I can tell the difference?

Cobb closes the door- turns to her, eyes full of bitter

tears.

                    COBB

          If it's my dream then why can't I

          control it? Why can't I stop this?

                    MAL

              (it's obvious)

          You don't know you're dreaming.

                    COBB

          You keep telling me I am-

                    MAL

          And you don't believe me!

                    COBB (V.O.)

          She was certain. But she loved me

          too much to go without me. So she

          made a plan...

INT. ELEGANT HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Cobb walks along, checking door numbers against a key.

                    COBB (V.O.)

          For our anniversary...

INT. ELEGANT HOTEL SUITE - CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK)

Cobb enters the lavish suite. He notices the DISHEVELED

BEDCLOTHES.

                                                          90.

He steps forwards- SMASH- he has tipped over a champagne

glass with his foot... dinner for two is SPREAD ACROSS THE

FLOOR. He looks at the DEBRIS, confused... next to the broken

glass is a SPINNING TOP. He picks it up, studying it,

thinking. He feels a draught, looks to the window. The

CURTAIN BILLOWS.

EXT. EXTERIOR ATRIUM - CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK)

Cobb looks out the window: Mal sits on the ledge of the

opposite window. HAIR BLOWING. Feet dangling over the

dizzyingly high atrium. She smiles.

                     MAL

          Join me.

                    COBB

          Mal, come back inside.

                    MAL

          No. I'm going to jump. And you're

          coming with me.

                    COBB

          No, I'm not. This is real-if you

          jump, you're not going to wake up,

          you're going to die. Let's go back

          inside and talk about this, please.

                    MAL

          We've talked enough.

She KICKS off a shoe and watches it DROP.

                    MAL

          Come out onto the ledge or I'll

          jump right now.

She means it. Cobb swings his legs out, sitting on the ledge

opposite is wife. He looks down at the drop.

                    MAL

          I'm asking you to take a leap of

          faith.

                    COBB

          I can't do that, Mal. I can't leave

          our children.

                    MAL

          If I go without you, they'll take

          them away, anyway.

                    COBB

          What do you mean?

                                                           91.

                     MAL

          I filed a letter with our attorney.

          Explaining how I'm fearful for my

          safety, how you've threatened to

          kill me...

Cobb looks back at the wrecked hotel suite, PANICKING...

                    MAL (CONT'D)

          I love you, Dom. I've freed you

          from the guilt of choosing to leave

          them. We're going home to our real

          children.

                    COBB

          Out children are here, Mal.

Mal CLOSES HER EYES. Cobb looks for some way to reach her...

                    MAL

          You're waiting for a train...

                    COBB

          NO! MAL, NO, I CAN'T!

                    MAL

          A train that will take you far

          away...

                    COBB

          DON'T DO THIS!

                    MAL

          You know where you hope this train

          will take you, you can't know for

          sure...

                    COBB

          DON'T!

                    MAL

          But it doesn't matter...

                    COBB

          NO!

                    MAL

          Because you'll be together...

Mal SLIPS FORWARD INTO SPACE. Cobb SCREAMS after her. Then

tries to bury his face in the wall...

INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - DAY

Cobb stares as he remembers.

                                                           92.

                    COBB

          He letter to the authorities

          refuted all the claims about her

          sanity that she knew I'd make...

INT. COBB AND MAL'S KITCHEN - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Cobb stands with the Thin Man, who has a piece of paper.

                    COBB (V.O.)

          She'd had herself declared sane by

          three different psychiatrists.

Cobb hears a SHOUT- turns to the garden. James CROUCHES,

Philippa joins him, examining the ground, FACES UNSEEN...

                    COBB (V.O.) (CONT'D)

          It was impossible for me to explain

          the nature of her madness...

The Thin Man thrusts the paper into Cobb's hand.

                    THIN MAN

          Right now. Or never, Cobb.

Cobb turns back to the window- about to call out- James and

Philippa RUN OFF. Cobb turns from the window. Looks at the

paper in his hand. It is an AIRPLANE TICKET.

                    COBB (V.O.)

          So I ran. And I've been running

          ever since, trying to buy my way

          back to my family...

INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - DAY

Cobb looks across at Ariadne.

                    ARIADNE

          Psychiatrists judged her sane?

                    COBB

          She was sane. She was just lost in

          the labyrinth.

                    ARIADNE

          Then why should you blame yourself?

                    COBB

          Because we were a family. And we

          had a life I would do anything to

          get back to now. But that reality

          wasn't enough for me then.

                                                        93.

                    ARIADNE

          It might have been your idea to

          push the limits, Cobb. But you're

          not responsible for the idea that

          destroyed her. The idea that her

          world wasn't real... that was her

          own idea from her own mind.

Cobb says nothing.

                    ARIADNE (CONT'D)

          Your guilt defines her. Powers her.

          If we're going to succeed in this,

          you're going to have to forgive

          yourself, and you're going to have

          to confront her. But you don't have

          to do it alone.

                    COBB

          You don't have to do this for me-

                    ARIADNE

          I'm doing it for the others. They

          don't know the risk they've taken

          coming in here with you.

Cobb looks at the rooftop opposite, sees a SNIPER take up a

position. Cobb shakes his head, frustrated.

                    COBB

          We can't stay here. Arthur?!

INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Browning puts his hand on Fischer's shoulder.

                    BROWNING

          These people are going to kill us

          if we don't give them the

          combination.

                    FISCHER

          They won't, they'll try to ransom

          us-

                    BROWNING

          I heard them-they're going to lock

          us in and run the can into the

          river.

                    FISCHER

          What is in the safe?

                                                           94.

                    BROWNING

          Something for you. Maurice always

          said it was his most previous

          gift... a will.

                    FISCHER

          Maurice's will is with Port and

          Dunn.

                    BROWNING

          It's an alternate. It supersedes

          the other only if you want it to.

                    FISCHER

          What does it say?

                    BROWNING

          It splits all the component

          businesses of Fischer Morrow into

          individual companies, transferring

          ownership to the boards of those

          companies...

                    FISCHER

          Leaving me nothing?

                    BROWNING

          A basic living. Nothing more. The

          entire empire would cease to exist.

                    FISCHER

          Destroy my own inheritance? Why

          would he suggest such a thing?

                    BROWNING

          I don't know, Robert.

Cobb OPENS the door. Arthur is behind him.

                    COBB

          Come to your senses?

                    FISCHER

          Let us go. I don't know the

          combination. Not consciously.

Cobb considers this. Opens his phone. Pulls out his gun.

                    COBB

          Let's try instinctively. I have

          someone standing in your father's

          office ready to tap in a

          combination.

He holds the phone to Fischer's mouth.

                                                           95.

                    COBB (CONT'D)

          First six numbers that come into

          your head. Right now.

                    FISCHER

          I have no idea-

Cobb SWINGS the gun onto Browning-

                       COBB

          RIGHT NOW!

                    FISCHER

          Five, two, eight... four, nine,

          one.

Cobb lowers his weapon. Listens to the phone. Shakes his

head. Shuts the phone.

                    COBB

          You'll have to do better. Bag `em.

Arthur puts SACKS over their heads.

INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Cobb and Arthur drag Fischer and Browning to the van-

                    FISCHER

          We're worth much more to you

          alive...

Arthur places Fischer on the back seat- uses a DROPPER to

drop LIQUID onto Fischer's mask- his head SLUMPS FORWARDS.

"Browning" yanks the sack from his head- it is now EAMES.

                    EAMES

              (excited)

          His relationship with his father's

          much worse that we thought.

                    ARTHUR

          That helps us?

Arthur pulls a SNIPER RIFLE from a case by the van.

                    COBB

          The stronger the issues, the more

          powerful the catharsis.

Cobb motions for Yusuf to follow his upstairs.

                    ARTHUR

          But how do you reconcile them if

          they're that estranged?

                                                           96.

                    EAMES

          I'm working on that.

Arthur lines up a shot through the window-

                    ARTHUR

          Well, work fast-Fischer's

          projections are closing in quick,

          we need to break out of here before

          we're totally boxed in...

Arthur SHOOTS two snipers. Cobb and Yusuf gently load Saito

into the van. He groans. Ariadne straps him in, checks his

bandages. Arthur can't get the last sniper- he's too hidden

behind a wall-

                    EAMES

          Shouldn't be afraid to dream a

          little bigger, Arthur-

Eames lines up a shot with a grenade launcher. Fires- the

sniper EXPLODES into the air- Arthur looks at Eames.

                      EAMES (CONT'D)

          Shall we?

They climb into the van-

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY STREETS - CONTINUOUS

The van pulls out into the rain-drenched streets. Arthur

opens the mechanism case and hands out tubes-

                    COBB

          Shifting Fischer's antipathy from

          his father onto Browning should

          work.

                    EAMES

          We need the imagery, the words...

                    ARIADNE

          So you destroy his one positive

          relationship?

                    COBB

          No. We repair his relationship with

          his father and expose his

          godfather's true nature.

                    EAMES

          Hell, we should be charging Fischer

          as much as Saito.

                                                        97.

                    ARTHUR

          What about his security? It's going

          to get worse as we go deeper.

                    COBB

          We bring in Mr. Charles.

                       ARTHUR

          No.

                    EAMES

          Who's Mr. Charles?

                    ARTHUR

          A bad idea.

                    COBB

          Arthur, the second we approach

          Fischer in that hotel, they're

          gonna mow us down-we run with Mr.

          Charles like on the Stein job.

                    EAMES

          So you've done it before?

                    ARTHUR

          Sure. But it didn't work. The

          subject realized he was dreaming

          and his subconscious tore us to

          pieces.

Eames takes this in.

                    EAMES

          You learned a lot, though. Right?

                    COBB

              (to Eames)

          I'll need a decoy.

                    EAMES

          No problem. How about a pretty

          young lady I've used before?

                       COBB

          Fine-

Cobb looks back: a second S.U.V. pulls out, tailing them.

                    COBB (CONT'D)

              (to Yusuf)

          I know you've got to stay ahead of

          them, but drive with kid gloves,

          okay? The world down there is going

          to be very unstable-

                                                        98.

                    ARTHUR

          And don't make the jump too soon-

          that kick is our only way back, we

          have to be ready to catch it-

                     YUSUF

          I'll use the music to let you know

          when it's coming, but the rest is

          up to you.

Arthur puts the mechanism onto the front seat.

                    YUSUF (CONT'D)

          Everyone ready?

Nods all round.

                    YUSUF (CONT'D)

          Sweet dreams-

Yusuf hits a button and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - SUNSET

Fischer nurses a drink. Staring at the ice cracking.

                    BLONDE (O.S.)

          Am I boring you?

Fischer looks up. A beautiful BLONDE is next to him.

                    BLONDE (CONT'D)

          I was telling you my story. I guess

          it wasn't to your liking.

                    FISCHER

          I have a lot on my mind.

Fischer looks around the bar. There are several STERN-LOOKING

CHARACTERS paying him too much attention.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

Arthur and Ariadne sit at a table across the lobby. They spot

Cobb moving across the lobby towards Fischer.

                    ARTHUR

          And there goes Mr. Charles.

                    ARIADNE

          Who or what, exactly, is Mr.

          Charles?

                                                        99.

                    ARTHUR

          It's a gambit designed to turn

          Fischer against his own

          subconscious.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - CONTINUOUS

Cobb approaches the bar, watched closely by Fischer's Sub-

security.

                    COBB

          Mr. Fishcer! Good to see you again.

          Rod Green, Marketing.

              (to Blonde)

          And you must be...

                     BLONDE

          Leaving.

She presses against Fischer as she slides off her stool and

deposits a cocktail napkin in front of him.

                    BLONDE (CONT'D)

          In case you get bored.

Cobb watches her walk away. The Sub-security FOLLOWS her.

                    COBB

          I think you just got blown off...

          unless her phone number really does

          have only six digits.

Fischer glances at the napkin: "528-491."

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

Arthur watches the Sub-security follow the Blonde.

                    ARIADNE

          And why don't you approve?

                    ARTHUR

          Because it involves telling the

          mark that he's dreaming. Which

          involves attracting a lot of

          attention to us.

                    ARIADNE

          Didn't Cobb say never to do that?

                    ARTHUR

          You must've noticed by now how much

          time Cobb spends doing things he

          says never to do.

                                                       100.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - CONTINUOUS

Cobb turns to Fischer.

                    COBB

          Strange way to make friends.

              (off look)

          Lifting your wallet, I mean.

Fischer pats his pocket. Empty. He looks to the lobby where

he sees the Sub-security trailing the Blonde.

                    FISCHER

          Goddamn it. The wallet alone's

          worth-

                    COBB

          Five hundred bucks. I know. Don't

          worry, my guys are on it.

                    FISCHER

          Who did you say you were?

Fischer looks at him, curious. Cobb plows on, confident-

                    COBB

          I said I was Rod Green from

          Marketing-but I'm not. My name is

          Mr. Charles. I might seem familiar

          to you. I'm in charge of your

          security here.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

The Blonde hurries up to Saito, emerging from the elevator-

                    BLONDE

          Mr. Saito, can I have a minute?

She pushes him back into the elevator, closing the door as

the Sub-security approaches...

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

The Blonde fondles Saito's lapels, getting close.

                    SAITO

          I'm sorry, but...

Saito glances over her shoulder to see, in the tunnel of

infinite reflections created by the elevator's opposing

mirrors, three reflections in, THE BLONDE IS EAMES. He winks.

                    SAITO (CONT'D)

              (pushing him away)

          Very amusing, Mr. Eames.

                                                       101.

                    EAMES

          You look a bit perkier.

A SHUDDER ripples through the elevator.

                    SAITO

          Turbulence on the plane.

                    EAMES

          Feels closer. That's Yusuf's

          driving.

And we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY DOWNTOWN STREETS - DAY

Yusuf FIGHTS the wheel as the van CUTS DOWN AN ALLEY, BUMPING

OVER POTHOLES and SMASHING TRASH CANS aside- THREE S.U.V.s IN

FURIOUS PURSUIT. Yusuf looks in the rear view mirror,

FRUSTRATED. He checks his WATCH, then checks the back: the

SLEEPERS SHAKE with the impact and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - NIGHT

As a TREMOR echoes through the bar Fischer looks at Cobb

trying to place him.

                    FISCHER

          Security? You work for the hotel?

                    COBB

          No. My specialty is subconscious

          security.

                    FISCHER

          You're talking about dreams. You're

          talking about extraction.

                    COBB

          Exactly. My job is to protect

          you...

Behind Fischer a WAITER puts down a tray- tipping a champagne

glass over- SMASH- Cobb NOTICES. Pauses, looks across the bar-

HIS TWO CHILDREN ARE CROUCHED, BACKS TOWARDS US...

Cobb looks around the bar, the patrons start to STARE at

Cobb, suspicious- Cobb shifts back to Fischer-

                                                          102.

                    COBB (CONT'D)

          My job is to protect you from any

          attempt to access your mind through

          your dreams.

Cobb regains his patter- the patrons lose interest...

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Eames pulls out Fischer's wallet, moves to hand it to Saito,

then PAUSES, opens it, leafs past the cast to find... The

SNAPSHOT: young Robert holding his HOMEMADE PINWHEEL, his

father blowing on it. The elevator doors open and Eames steps

off. HANDS Saito the wallet.

                    EAMES

          Get off at a different floor and

          keep moving. Dump the wallet, then

          meet me in the lobby. The security

          will try to track it down. We need

          to buy Cobb a little more time.

The doors close. Saito puts the wallet in his pocket. He

COUGHS- a deep, nasty cough.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - CONTINUOUS

Cobb looks over Fischer's shoulder to see a SUITED MAN

watching him. Another MAN is walking in from the lobby.

                    COBB

          You're not safe here.

Cobb steps away from the bar. Fischer does not move.

                    COBB (CONT'D)

          Trust me. They're coming for you.

Fischer sizes him up, A CLAP OF THUNDER ECHOES, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY DOWNTOWN STREETS - DAY

GUNSHOTS BLAST out the rear and side windows of the van- a

Security Man is leaning out of the lead S.U.V. With a SHOTGUN-

WIND AND RAIN RIP THROUGH THE VAN- in the back, ARTHUR'S

SLEEPING FACE IS WHIPPED BY THE SPRAY, AND WE-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - SUNSET

Fischer looks out the windows at sudden, HURRICANE-LIKE RAIN-

                                                         103.

                    COBB

          Strange weather, huh?

A TREMOR runs through the bar- Cobb looks around-

                    COBB (CONT'D)

          You feel that?

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

Ariadne and Arthur watch the GUSTS OF WIND RATTLE the

windows. Arthur sees HOTEL GUESTS staring out at the weather,

PUZZLED. Several of them TURN TO LOOK DIRECTLY AT ARTHUR.

                    ARIADNE

          What's happening?

                    ARTHUR

          Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention

          to the strangeness of the dream.

          That's making his subconscious look

          for the dreamer. For me.

And we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY STREETS - DAY

At the end of the alley-   Yusuf THROWS the van into a HARD

RIGHT TURN- we move into   EXTREME SLOW MOTION... THE SLEEPERS

IN THE BACK ARE DRAWN TO   ONE SIDE OF THE VAN BY THE

CENTRIFUGAL FORCE... and   we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - CONTINUOUS

The liquid in Fischer's drink RISES UP AGAINST ONE SIDE OF

THE GLASS- Fischer notices, confused.

                     COBB

          Very odd-the weather, the

          gravity...

Fischer looks around the bar- it's as if THE ENTIRE ROOM IS

SET AT A 45-DEGREE ANGLE- glasses SLIDING off tables...

                    COBB (CONT'D)

          But I can explain all this. You've

          actually been trained for this.

              (Fischer nods)

          Think of the strangeness of the

          weather, the shifts in gravity.

          None of this is real...

                    (MORE)

                                                         104.

                    COBB (CONT'D)

              (beat)

          We're in a dream.

Fischer looks at the room around them. Back to Cobb. All

through the bar, patrons turn to look at Cobb IN UNISON.

                    COBB (CONT'D)

          The simplest test of what I'm

          saying is for you to try and

          remember anything about the way you

          arrived in this hotel... okay?

Fischer stares at Cobb, trying to process this. All around

them, people STARE at Cobb. Several get up as if to approach.

                    COBB (CONT'D)

          Breathe. Remember the training.

          Accept the fact that we're in a

          dream. That's why I'm here

          protecting you.

As Fischer considers this we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY STREETS - DAY

Yusuf STRAIGHTENS UP the van, RACING down the street,

swerving through traffic and we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - EVENING

The building gradually EASES BACK INTO ALIGNMENT-

                    FISCHER

          So you... you're not real?

The bar patrons start to ignore Cobb again.

                    COBB

          No. I'm a projection of your

          subconscious. I was put in place to

          protect you in the event that

          extractors pulled you into a dream.

          I believe that's what has happened.

Fischer takes this in. Then looks at the Security Men

approaching across the crooked floor, he nods at Cobb-

                                                          105.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - EVENING

Cobb escorts Fischer across the lobby. As he does so, he

walks past the two CHILDREN, backs to us- Cobb ignores them-

The two Sub-security fall in behind. Cobb hurries Fischer up

the stairs- then PUSHES him into-

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Fischer stumbles in- turns to Cobb, angry-

                    FISCHER

          Hey-

Cobb reaches into his jacket- the First Man BURSTS in- Cobb

KICKS him to the ground- DRAWS his gun as the SECOND MAN

comes through the door, moving towards Fischer-

BLAM! Cobb BLASTS the Second Man in the back- TURNS and

SHOOTS the First Man.

                    FISCHER (CONT'D)

          Jesus Christ! What are you doing?!

Cobb turns to Fischer, calm. Convincing.

                    COBB

          Look at the gun in his hand.

Fischer looks: the Second Man was holding a pistol. Cobb

opens the First Man's jacket to show Fischer his holster and

sidearm.

                    COBB (CONT'D)

          These men were sent to abduct you.

Cobb pulls out the gun and HANDS it to Fischer.

                    COBB (CONT'D)

          If I'm going to help you, I need

          you to be calm.

Fischer remembers something.

                    FISCHER

          If this is a dream, I have to kill

          myself and wake up-

Fischer raises the gun towards his head-

                    COBB

          I wouldn't do that-they've probably

          got you sedated. If you pull that

          trigger, you might not wake up, you

          might drop into a lower dream

          state.

                    (MORE)

                                                       106.

                    COBB (CONT'D)

          Mr. Fischer, you know all this, you

          just have to remember it...

Fischer lowers his gun.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Saito walks down the corridor, followed by a Security Man.

Saito DUCKS around the corner, moves to a GARBAGE CHUTE and

DROPS Fischer's WALLET into it. He SLIPS into the stairwell

as the Security Man comes abreast of the chute and pauses.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Arthur leads Ariadne to a particular room: 491.

INT. ROOM 491 - CONTINUOUS

Arthur leads Ariadne in. He opens the closet, opens the room

safe, pulls our FOUR BRICKS OF PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE.

                    ARTHUR

          So, if everything's correct, this

          room should be directly below 528.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Cobb looks reassuringly at Fischer.

                    COBB

          What do you remember from before

          this dream?

                    FISCHER

              (thinking)

          Rain... gunfire... Uncle Peter.

              (looks up)

          Christ-we've been kidnapped.

                    COBB

          Where were they holding you?

                    FISCHER

          They had us... in the back of a

          van...

                    COBB

          Your body's bouncing around in the

          back of a van right now-that

          explains the gravity shifts.

                    FISCHER

          It was... to do with a safe...

          Christ, why's it so hard to

          remember?

                                                        107.

                    COBB

          It's like trying to remember a

          dream after you've woken up. It

          takes years of practice to do it

          easily. So, you and Browning have

          been pulled into this dream so they

          can steal something from your mind.

          What?

                    FISCHER

          They wanted a combination to a

          safe... they demanded the first

          numbers to pop into my head.

                    COBB

          That's them extracting a locator.

                       FISCHER

          A locator?

                    COBB

          A number from your own

          subconscious. It can be used any

          number of ways...

              (thinking)

          This is a hotel. Room numbers. What

          was the number you gave them?

                    FISCHER

          5, 2... something... it was a long

          number. 528... 528, 4 something.

                    COBB

              (opens phone)

          Well, we know where to start.

              (into phone)

          Fifth floor.

INT. ROOM 491 - CONTINUOUS

Arthur hangs up the phone. He is standing on a chair,

attaching the explosives to the ceiling.

                    ARIADNE

          Do you use a timer?

                    ARTHUR

          No, I have to judge it myself. Once

          you're all asleep up in room 528, I

          wait `til Yusuf starts his kick...

                    ARIADNE

          How will you know?

                                                        108.

                    ARTHUR

          His music warns me it's coming,

          then the van hitting the barrier of

          the bridge should be unmistakable-

          that's when I blow the floor out

          from underneath us and we get a

          nice synchronized kick. Too soon,

          and we won't get pulled out; too

          late and I won't be able to drop

          us.

                       ARIADNE

          Why not?

                    ARTHUR

          The van will be in free fall. I

          can't drop us with no gravity.

Arthur finishes setting the charges.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

Saito moves through the lobby. Browning is coming in the

other direction. Saito assumes him to be Eames.

                    SAITO

          I see you've changed.

                       BROWNING

          I'm sorry?

Eames comes up behind Browning, catching Saito's eye.

                    SAITO

          I'm... I mistook you for a friend.

                    BROWNING

          Good-looking fellow, I'm sure.

Browning moves off. Saito approaches Eames.

                    EAMES

          That's Fischer's projection of

          Browning. We'll keep an eye on how

          he behaves-

                       SAITO

          Why?

                    EAMES

          How he acts will tell us if

          Fischer's starting to suspect his

          motives the way we want him to.

                                                       109.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR, FIFTH FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

Cobb leads Fischer around a corner. Arthur and Ariadne are

waiting in the corridor.

                    COBB

          They work for me.

Fischer starts looking at room numbers. Stops at 528. Cobb

draws his gun, steps back from the door and KICKS it open.

INT. ROOM 528 - CONTINUOUS

Cobb JUMPS into the room, gun up. The room is empty. Arthur

and Ariadne search the room. Saito and Eames arrive. Eames

shuts the door. Arthur FINDS something-

                    ARTHUR

          Mr. Charles!

Arthur holds up a MECHANISM CASE. Cobb shows it to Fischer.

                    COBB

          You know what this is?

Fischer's eyes roam over the dials and plungers.

                    FISCHER

          I think so. But I don't understand.

                    COBB

          They were going to put you under.

                    FISCHER

          I'm already under.

                    COBB

          Under again.

                    FISCHER

          A dream within a dream?

                    ARTHUR

          Shhhh!

Arthur is at the door. Someone is there. A key goes into the

lock- the door starts to open- Arthur REACHES OVER and GRABS

the person entering, THROWS THEM TO THE FLOOR- puts his gun

in their face. IT IS BROWNING.

Fischer stares, disbelieving, at his own godfather.

                    FISCHER

          Uncle Peter. What's going on?

Cobb pulls the key from Browning's hand: ROOM 528.

                                                        110.

                    COBB

          You said you were kidnapped

          together?

                    FISCHER

          Not exactly, they already had him.

          They'd been torturing him...

                    COBB

          You saw them torture him?

Fischer shakes his head. Looks at Browning. Thinking.

                    FISCHER

          The kidnappers are working for you.

                    BROWNING

          No, Robert-

                    FISCHER

          You're trying to get that safe

          open. To get the alternate will.

Browning looks up at Fischer.

                    BROWNING

          Fischer Morrow's been my entire

          life. I can't let you destroy it.

                    FISCHER

          I'm not going to throw away my

          inheritance. Why would I?

                    BROWNING

          I couldn't take the chance of you

          rising to your father's final

          taunt.

                    FISCHER

          What taunt?

                    BROWNING

          That will. I'm sorry, Robert, but

          it's his final insult. A challenge

          to build something for yourself.

          He's telling you that you aren't

          worthy of his achievements.

Fischer takes this in. Devastated.

                    FISCHER

          That he was "disappointed?"

                                                       111.

                    BROWNING

          I'm so sorry. But he was wrong.

          You'll make his company even

          greater than he ever could.

                    COBB

          Your godfather's lying, Robert.

Fischer turns to Cobb.

                    FISCHER

          How do you know?

                     COBB

          It's what I do. He's hiding

          something.

Cobb looks at Browning.

                    COBB

          Let's find out what.

Cobb nods at Arthur, who starts unpacking the mechanism.

Browning watches. Silent.

                    COBB

          Let's do to him what he was going

          to do to you.

Cobb rolls up his sleeve. Nods at Fischer to do the same.

                    COBB

          We'll penetrate his subconscious

          and find out what he doesn't want

          you to know.

Fischer looks Cobb in the eye. Decides- rolls up his sleeve,

offering his bare arm. The team run tubes to each other-

Arthur injects Fischer, whose head slumps.

                      ARTHUR

          He's out.

                    ARIADNE

          Wait, Cobb-I'm lost. Whose

          subconscious are we going into?

                    COBB

          Fischer's. I told him it was

          Browning's so he'd come with us as

          part of our team.

                    ARTHUR

              (impressed)

          He's going to help us break into

          his own subconscious.

                                                       112.

                    COBB

          That's the idea. He'll think that

          his security is Browning's and

          fight them to learn the truth about

          his father.

Arthur hits buttons on the mechanism. The team goes out one

by one. Cobb is last.

                    COBB

          Fischer's subconscious is going to

          run you down hard.

                    ARTHUR

          I'll lead them on a merry chase.

                    COBB

          Be back in time for the kick.

                       ARTHUR

          I'm on it.

Cobb is no longer listening- he stares at the net curtains,

BILLOWING like those in Mal's suite- a GLIMPSE of someone

(Mal?) As the screen goes WHITE, and we are-

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - DAY

CLOSE ON Cobb's face, staring. Fixed.

                    ARIADNE (O.S.)

          Cobb? Cobb?

Ariadne is beside him. They stand on a cliff, dressed in

white snowsuits, carrying white-painted weapons like WWII

commandos. Cobb checks his SNIPER RIFLE, examines their

objective: a massive FORTIFIED MEDICAL FACILITY a mile below.

                    ARIADNE

          What's down there?

                    COBB

          Hopefully, the truth we want

          Fischer to learn.

                    ARIADNE

          I meant what's down there for you?

Cobb turns to her. Eames, Saito and Fischer arrive, SKIING

down from the hill above. Cobb pulls Eames out of Fischer's

earshot.

                    COBB

          You're the dreamer. I need you to

          draw the security away from the

          complex.

                                                       113.

                    EAMES

          Then who guides Fischer in? You?

                    COBB

          If I know the route... we could be

          compromised.

Eames looks as Cobb, uneasy. Ariadne comes over.

                    ARIADNE

          I designed the place.

                    COBB

          No. You're with me.

                    SAITO (O.S.)

          I could do it.

They turn to Saito. Saito shrugs at Eames. Eames smiles.

                    COBB

          Eames, brief Saito on the route

          into the complex. What we're

          looking for is going to be in the

          most heavily fortified section.

          That north tower.

Cobb moves to Fischer. Saito COUGHS. SPITS. Eames sees BLOOD

on the snow. Looks at Saito.

                     COBB

          Mr. Fischer, you're going in with

          Mr. Saito.

                    FISCHER

          You're not coming in?

                    COBB

          You have to do this on your own.

          You have to get in there, break

          into your godfather's mind and find

          out the truth about your father.

Cobb taps Fischer's radio mike.

                    COBB

          Keep this live at all times. I'll

          be listening in, covering you.

              (holds up the sniper

               rifle)

          The windows on the upper floors are

          big enough that I can cover you

          from that south tower.

                                                       114.

Cobb slips into his skis, shoulders his rifle.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. ROOM 528 - NIGHT

Arthur checks the mechanism. He hears LOW BOOMS like thunder.

He checks his watch- THE SECOND HAND CRAWLS FORWARDS. With a

last look at the sleepers, he heads out into the corridor...

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY DOWNTOWN STREETS - DAY

A GUNSHOT slams into the van as Yusuf DRIVES- he glances back

to see a MOTORCYCLE pulling up behind him, the REAR PASSENGER

FIRING A SHOTGUN- the bike pulls alongside Yusuf's window as

the passenger RELOADS- Yusuf YANKS the wheel TOWARDS the

bike, bringing the shotgun barrel into the cab so he can GRAB

it, spin the wheel back- PULLING the passenger from the back

of the bike... Yusuf turns a corner, heading into a disused

MARKET-

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Arthur walks towards the elevator. It OPENS- a SECURITY MAN

emerges, heading right for him. Arthur takes a TURN, speeding

up. The BOOMS are louder, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY DOWNTOWN STREETS - DAY

The bike crosses behind the van, catching up again as the

driver pulls a handgun and starts BLASTING. Up ahead, an

S.U.V. sits in a side road, lining up to head off the van-

the SECURITY MAN driving the S.U.V. guns it, as the bike

creeps up on the other side of the van- Yusuf HITS THE

BRAKES, forcing the bike out into the path of the S.U.V.,

tossing the rider like a rag doll-

Heading out of the market, the van races onto a FREEWAY ON

RAMP, approaching the BRIDGE. An S.U.V. SMASHES into the

van's side, FORCING it up against a CRASH BARRIER... the van

starts to SLOWLY TILT OVER THE BARRIER as the S.U.V. PUSHES-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

As Arthur hurries down the corridor, the corridor starts to

TILT, and Arthur is forced to run UP ONTO THE WALL- he rounds

a corner- STRAIGHT INTO another Security Man- Arthur HEAD

BUTTS him and they STRUGGLE- as they struggle, the corridor

SPINS around, THROWING THEM UP ONTO THE WALLS, THE CEILING-

as wall becomes floor they DROP through a door into-

                                                          115.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The fight continues all over the spinning room- and we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY OFF RAMP NEAR BRIDGE - DAY

SLEEPING ARTHUR BOUNCES around as the van TILTS, SCRAPING

along the barrier- the van CLEARS THE END OF THE BARRIER AND

ROLLS DOWN THE EMBANKMENT, and we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Arthur and the Security Man DROP to the floor, Arthur on top.

Arthur gets up- heads to the stairwell.

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY STREETS NEAR BRIDGE - DAY

The van SETTLES with a thump. Yusuf BREATHES hard. Then

SMILES as he realizes he is in one piece. A RINGING BELL up

ahead makes him look up to the bridge, where the barriers are

starting to come down. Yusuf checks his watch-

                    YUSUF

          Bugger.

Yusuf hits the gas, heading for the bridge. An S.U.V. lines

up behind him, trying to catch up before the van crosses the

barrier onto the bridge-

The van JUST MAKES IT- the S.U.V. behind RIPS its read axle

off, SCRAPING to a halt on the rising section. The Security

Man inside starts FIRING on the van...

INT. HOTEL STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

Arthur RACES down the steps- OPENS the door to the fourth

floor- spots SECURITY MEN outside room 491.

                    ARTHUR

          Hey!

They TURN- he DARTS back into the stairwell- RACES down the

stairs- the Security Men follow- they start SHOOTING, and we-

                                                    CUT TO:

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - DAY

Eames SKIS down within sight of the hospital complex. He

reaches into his pack and lets off a FLARE.

                                                       116.

EXT. HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Security Men on the ramparts spot the flare and send PATROLS

out on skis and SNOWMOBILES to investigate.

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Eames watches them close in, then launches himself down the

mountain, STREAKING across the icy slope, and we-

                                                   CUT TO:

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY RISING BRIDGE - DAY

Yusuf PULLS FORWARD, looking over his shoulder to line up a

BACKWARDS RUN at the edge. He DUCKS as vicious FIRE from the

S.U.V. HAMMERS the vehicle. He looks at his watch. The SECOND

HAND TICKING SLOWLY...

                    YUSUF

          Sod it. I hope your ready.

He grabs an MP3 player and reaches into the back to place

HEADPHONES on sleeping Arthur's head. As he does so, he

notices Saito's bandage BLEEDING THROUGH. Yusuf hits PLAY-

Edith Piaf's "Non, je ne regrette rien" starts up and we-

                                                   CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL STAIRWELL - NIGHT

Arthur STOPS, hearing something- MASSIVE LOW-END MUSICAL

TONES- he looks up PANICKED-

                    ARTHUR

          No, Yusuf. Too soon!

SHOTS slam into the stairs around him and we-

                                                   CUT TO:

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - DAY

Cobb and Ariadne make their way down towards the complex.

                    EAMES (OVER RADIO)

          Cobb? Are you hearing that?

Cobb listens. The wind sounds unusually LOW.

EXT. FOREST, SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Eames is hidden at the base of some trees, whispering as a

patrol passes beneath his position.

                                                        117.

                    EAMES

          I noticed it twenty minutes ago-at

          first I thought it was just wind...

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Cobb is listening intently. The "wind" changes pitch.

                    COBB

          No, it's music. Dammit.

                    EAMES (OVER RADIO)

          What do we do?

                    COBB

          We move fast. Saito, did you copy?

EXT. MOUNTAINS, THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Saito and Fischer CLIMB down a CLIFF FACE above the complex-

                    SAITO

          We're going as fast as we can.

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Ariadne looks at Cobb, concerned.

                    ARIADNE

          How long do we have?

                    COBB

          Yusuf's about ten seconds from the

          jump, which gives Arthur about

          three minutes, which gives us about-

                    ARIADNE

          Sixty minutes.

                    COBB

          The route you gave them, can they

          do it in under an hour?

                    ARIADNE

          I don't think so. They've still got

          to climb down to the middle

          terrace.

                    COBB

          They need a new route-a direct

          route.

                     ARIADNE

          The building's designed as a

          labyrinth.

                                                       118.

                    COBB

          There must be access routes that

          cut through the maze.

              (into radio)

          Eames?

EXT. FOREST, SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Eames cannot answer- he SLALOMS through the forest, Sub-

security in hot pursuit, bullets smashing into the trunks...

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Cobb turns to Ariadne.

                    COBB

          Did Eames add any features?

                    ARIADNE

          Yes.

                    COBB

          What did he add?

Ariadne looks at Cobb.

                    ARIADNE

          I shouldn't tell you. If Mal-

                    COBB

          There's no time-what did he add?

                    ARIADNE

          Utility closets, trap doors...

                    COBB

          What about service features? Did he

          add any large pipes or-

                    ARIADNE

          Ducts. He added an air duct system-

          it doesn't follow the maze. They

          can use it to go straight from the

          outer walls to the upper tower.

                    COBB

          Explain it to them.

          Saito?

EXT. CLIFF FACE BEHIND COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Saito is using a hammer to tap in a belay.

                                                       119.

                      SAITO

          Go ahead.

And we-

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY RAISED BRIDGE - DAY

Yusuf looks at the Security Man in the S.U.V., gives him the

finger and hits the GAS- RACING BACKWARDS at the barrier...

and we-

                                                   CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL STAIRWAY - NIGHT

Arthur RUNS UP the stairs, gun in hand- rounds a corner and-

IMPOSSIBLY- arrives behind the Security Man, who looks at

him, CONFUSED, then looks down to realize he is now at the

edge of a dangerous drop- Arthur shrugs.

                      ARTHUR

          Paradox.

Arthur PUSHES him over the edge- he falls- Arthur races up to

the fourth floor- throws open the door- and we-

                                                   CUT TO:

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY RAISED BRIDGE - DAY

In SLOW MOTION- the van SMASHES THROUGH THE CONCRETE BARRIER-

and we-

                                                   CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Arthur is SPRINTING down the corridor when a TREMENDOUS CRASH

sends him FLYING into the air- and we-

                                                   CUT TO:

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - DAY

A MASSIVE RUMBLE prompts Cobb to look across the valley-

EXT. FOREST, SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Eames shoots out of the trees, then FALLS to the snow as he

sees a great CRACKING up ahead- the SLOPE IS FALLING AWAY IN

AN AVALANCHE-

                                                       120.

EXT. CLIFF FACE BEHIND COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Saito hears the RUMBLE above them. He looks down, Fischer is

below, near the bottom of the sheer face-

                      SAITO

          Look out!

Saito CUTS the rope- they FALL- HIT the icy face and SLIDE

down the slope, clearing the path of the avalanche- and we-

                                                   CUT TO:

INT./EXT. VAN - DAY

In EXTREME SLOW MOTION, the van emerges from the concrete

balustrade and starts FALLING- and we-

                                                   CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Arthur is still FLYING through the corridor, NOT LANDING-

GRAVITY HAS DISAPPEARED... he scrambles for a handhold,

GRABBING a sconce- and we-

                                                   CUT TO:

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - DAY

Cobb watches the avalanche cloud slide past the complex.

                    ARIADNE

          What was that?

                      COBB

          The kick.

                    EAMES (OVER RADIO)

          Cobb? Did we miss it?

                    COBB

          Yeah, we missed it.

EXT. FOREST, SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Eames is lying on the snow.

                    EAMES

          What the hell do we do now?

                    COBB (OVER RADIO)

          Finish the job before the next

          kick.

                                                         121.

                    EAMES

          What next kick?

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Cobb looks at Ariadne as he talks into the radio.

                    COBB

          When the van hits the water. I

          figure Arthur's got a couple

          minutes and we've got about twenty.

Cobb and Ariadne MOVE towards the base of the complex.

EXT. HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Saito and Fischer RUN around the base of the building. They

find a large EXHAUST PORT. Lay a charge on the GRILL. They

blow the charge. Climb into the open vent.

INT./EXT. VAN - DAY

In EXTREME SLOW MOTION, the van seems SUSPENDED IN MID-AIR

TEN STORIES ABOVE THE RIVER... and we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

In ZERO GRAVITY, Arthur pulls himself to the door of 491,

opens it. He looks at the charges planted on the ceiling.

                    ARTHUR

          How the hell do I drop you?

He PULLS the charges from the ceiling. Hurrying. And we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Saito and Fischer hurry through the duct system. Saito is

falling behind, coughing up blood.

EXT. UPPER TERRACE, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Cobb GRABS a Security Guard from behind, strangling him

unconscious. He beckons to Ariadne, covering her as she runs

towards him. They enter the base of the south tower.

INT. TOP ROOM, SOUTH TOWER, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

A guard is manning the tower. Cobb and Ariadne enter- Cobb

SHOOTS the guard and moves to the window.

                                                       122.

                    ARIADNE

              (she points)

          That's the antechamber outside the

          strongroom.

Cobb looks at the large windows of the antechamber.

                    COBB

          What about the strongroom? Doesn't

          it have any windows?

                    ARIADNE

          Wouldn't be very strong if it did.

              (off look)

          Look, if you wanted to design it

          yourself-

                    COBB

          It's fine. Better hope that we like

          what Fischer finds in there.

Cobb sets up his sniper rifle. Through the scope he can see

three guards on the balcony outside the chamber. Three more

inside. Cobb casually picks them off with his rifle. Ariadne

watches through binoculars, appalled.

                    ARIADNE

          These projections, they're part of

          his subconscious?

                    COBB

          Yeah.

                    ARIADNE

          Are you destroying those parts of

          his mind?

                    COBB

          No, of course not. They're just

          projections.

                    EAMES (OVER RADIO)

          Cobb? Something's wrong?

EXT. FOREST, SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Eames is watching the patrols HEAD BACK towards the complex.

                    EAMES

          They're heading your way. Like they

          know something.

INT. TOP ROOM, SOUTH TOWER, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Cobb hears this. Concerned.

                                                         123.

                    COBB

          Buy us some time.

                       EAMES (OVER RADIO)

          On my way.

EXT. FOREST, SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Eames TAKES OFF towards the base of the complex. And we=

                                                   CUT TO:

INT. ROOM 528 - NIGHT

Arthur FLOATS into the room. The SLEEPERS are floating,

loosely connected by their tubes. Arthur looks at them, MIND

RACING. He PULLS Cobb towards Eames, and we-

                                                   CUT TO:

INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - DAY

Saito and Fischer approach the grate covering the exit to the

anteroom. Saito SLUMPS to the floor of the duct, pulls out

his radio. Fischer looks at him- he is PALE, SHIVERING.

Fischer takes the radio, WHISPERS into it.

                    FISCHER

              (into radio)

          We're here. Are we clear to

          proceed?

INT. TOP ROOM, SOUTH TOWER, HOSPITAL COMPLEC - CONTINUOUS

Cobb SCANS the anteroom through the scope-it looks clear.

                    COBB

          You're clear, but hurry-there's an

          army headed your way...

Ariadne watches the patrols approaching the complex...

INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

The SQUELCH from the radio is too loud- Fischer GRABS it and

turns the volume to zero as he starts to remove the grate...

EXT. BASE OF THE HOPISTAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Eames is setting MINES along the LOWEST WALL of the

structure. He moves carefully-there is a SHEER DROP below the

wall...

                                                       124.

INT. TOP ROOM, SOUTH TOWER, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Cobb SPOTS something through his scope. Something above the

main windows, glimpsed through the side of the skylight.

                    COBB

          Shit. There's someone else in

          there.

Cobb prepares to fire. Ariadne GRABS the radio-

                    ARIADNE

          Fischer, stop! It's a trap!-

INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Fischer does not see the flashing light on his radio as he

carefully lifts the grate. He motions for Saito to stay...

INT. TOP ROOM, SOUTH TOWER, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Cobb TENSES to fire.

                    COBB

          Come on... a little lower... a

          little-

COBB FREEZES- IT IS MAL IN HIS SIGHTS. Ariadne puts up her

binoculars. Spots Mal. Fischer is climbing out of the vent...

                    ARIADNE

          Cobb, that's not really her-

Cobb turns to her-

                    COBB

          How can you know that?

INT. ANTECHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

Fischer moves into the antechamber, cautious-

                       FISCHER

          I'm in.

Fischer turns up the volume-

                    ARIADNE (OVER RADIO)

          Fischer, look out!-

Mal DROPS gracefully to the floor behind him-

                       MAL

          Hello.

                                                       125.

INT. TOP ROOM, SOUTH TOWER, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Cobb looks at Ariadne-

                    ARIADNE

          Cobb, she's just a projection.

          Fischer... he's real.

Cobb thinks. Nods, TURNS back to the scope- too late- MAL

SHOOTS FISCHER- Cobb reflexively pulls the trigger- Mal GOES

DOWN- Cobb steps back from the scope, STUNNED.

                    ARIADNE

          Eames? Get to the anteroom now!

They run for the door.

INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Saito STARTS as he hears the shot. He starts edging forwards,

clutching his belly. And we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. ROOM 528 - NIGHT

The sleepers are floating in a rough stack, top-and-tailed.

Arthur pulls the bedding from the bed and uses the sheet to

bind the sleepers together. And we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT./EXT. VAN - DAY

In EXTREME SLOW MOTION, the van CREEPS DOWNWARDS, still high

above the river... and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Arthur PUSHES the floating stack of sleepers to the elevator.

He hits the button- the doors open- he pushes them in- GRABS

the charges- climbs through the hatch in the ceiling and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - DAY

Eames steps over Saito, who looks up at him with DYING eyes-

INT. ANTECHAMBER, HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

Eames jumps out of the vent to find Cobb and Ariadne standing

over the bodies of Fischer and Mal.

                                                       126.

                    EAMES

          What happened?

                    ARIADNE

          Mal killed Fischer-

                    COBB

          I wouldn't shoot her.

Eames grabs a defibrillator from the wall and pulls Fischer's

jacket open-

                    COBB

          It won't do any good-

Eames SHOCKS Fischer's chest...

                    COBB

          Even if you could revive his body,

          his mind's trapped down there. It's

          over.

Eames listens for a pulse. Looks up at Cobb.

                    EAMES

          So that it, then? We failed.

                       COBB

          I'm sorry.

                    EAMES

          It's you who doesn't get back to

          your family.

Eames looks down at Fischer. Then over to the double doors.

                    EAMES

          I wanted to know what was going to

          happen in there. I think we had

          this one.

                    ARIADNE

          There's still a way: We follow

          Fischer down-

They look at her.

                    EAMES

          We're almost out of time-

                    ARIADNE

          Down there they'll be enough time.

          We'll find him-soon as you hear

          Arthur's music start, you use the

          defibrillator to revive him-we give

          him his own early kick from below.

                    (MORE)

                                                       127.

                    ARIADNE (CONT'D)

          Get him in there-

              (points to doors)

          Then, as the music ends you blow

          the hospital and we all ride the

          kick back up through the layers.

Eames looks at her, then to Cobb.

                    EAMES

          Okay, Saito can hold them off while

          I plant the rest of the charges.

                    COBB

          Saito's not going to last, Eames.

                    ARIADNE

          We have to try!

                    EAMES

          Go for it, but I'm taking the kick

          whether you're back or not...

Eames pulls the mechanism from his pack. Offers it to

Ariadne. Cobb watches. Silent. Ariadne pulls out the tubes-

                    ARIADNE

          Can I trust you to do what's

          needed? Mal's down there-

                    COBB

          And I can find her. She'll have

          Fischer.

                    ARIADNE

          How do you know?

                    COBB

          She wants me to come after him. She

          wants me back down there with her.

Cobb rolls up his sleeve. Ariadne rolls up her own sleeve.

Eames NODS. Cobb and Ariadne lie down. Eames hits the button-

WATER. BUBBLES. DROWNING. And we are-

EXT. COAST (LIMBO) - DAY

Ariadne lies in the SURF, STARING up at a CLOUDLESS SKY. A

tremendous BOOM prompts her to look around her- URBAN

BUILDINGS PILED right down to the water. The buildings are

DECAYING, falling into the ocean like a GLACIER calving. Cobb

WADES towards her through the shallow water. Ariadne looks up

at the crumbling city around them.

                    ARIADNE

          This is your world?

                                                         128.

                    COBB

          It was. And this is where she'll

          be.

And we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - DAY

Arthur floats on top of the elevator, planting small charges

on the EMERGENCY BRAKES and CABLE. He sets them, GRABS the

other explosives, then PUSHES AWAY, shooting up the shaft. As

he hits the DETONATOR, BLASTING the braking and safety

systems of the elevator, we move into SLOW MOTION, the

fireballs FLAMING OUT in graceful licks and we-

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ANTECHAMBER - DAY

Eames RACES around, full speed- getting the defibrillator

paddles- laying them by Fischer's body- he runs into the duct-

pulls Saito up to a seated position and hands him a handgun.

                    EAMES

          Come on, Saito. I need you to cover

          Fischer while I plant the charges.

Saito nods weakly, tries to hold the gun. Eames moves to the

window- pulls his machine gun off- checks its load. Ready. He

watches the security patrols climb up the outer walls...

Eames lays down a HAIL of covering fire- then heads outside-

EXT. HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Eames races along the upper terrace dodging fire- BULLETS

SHATTER a window behind him and we move into SLOW MOTION, the

glass CASCADING GENTLY and we-

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. COAST (LIMBO)- DAY

Cobb and Ariadne climb out of the waves, full speed. They

move into the shadow of the tall, crumbling buildings. The

streets are eerily DESERTED. As they move further in, the

buildings become NEWER, different. Ariadne marvels at the

extraordinary collection of buildings- every architectural

style imaginable in waves of FAILED UTOPIAS.

                    ARIADNE

          You built all this?

                    COBB

          We both did.

                                                       129.

                    ARIADNE

          It's incredible.

                    COBB

          We built for years. Then, when that

          got stale, we started in on the

          memories.

A child's SHOUT echoes through the deserted canyons,

prompting Cobb to look down a side street: a LITTLE BLONDE

BOY crouched, his back to us. A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL joins the

boy, and, as Cobb turns down the street, they run off.

Cobb and Ariadne emerge into a peculiar SQUARE lined with an

eclectic mix of buildings, from APARTMENT BLOCKS to HOUSES.

                    COBB

          This is our neighborhood.

                    ARIADNE

              (confused)

          From what city?

                    COBB

          No. Our neighborhood.

              (pointing)

          That was our first apartment...

          then we moved to that building...

          we got that small house when Mal

          became pregnant.

                    ARIADNE

          You reconstructed them all from

          memory?

                    COBB

          We had time.

Cobb pauses in front of a French country house. Staring.

                    ARIADNE

          What's that?

                    COBB

          The house Mal grew up in.

                    ARIADNE

          Will she be in there?

                    COBB

          No. Come on-

Cobb leads Ariadne to the entrance of a glass skyscraper.

                                                        130.

INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY (LIMBO) - CONTINUOUS

Cobb leads Ariadne across the gleaming lobby to the

elevators.

                    COBB

          We both wanted a house, but we both

          loved skyscrapers. In the real

          world we had to choose. Not here.

INT. SKYSCRAPER ELEVATOR (LIMBO) - CONTINUOUS

Cobb pulls out his handgun, and a ziplock bag full of

bullets.

                    ARIADNE

          How do we send Fischer back?

                    COBB

          We need some kind of kick.

                    ARIADNE

          What?

                    COBB

          I'll improvise.

Cobb COCKS his weapon, and the ELEVATOR STOPS. The doors

open. Ariadne moves to exit, Cobb stops her.

                     COBB

          There's something you have to

          understand about me. About

          inception. You see, an idea is like

          a virus...

Cobb leads her out of the lift...

INT. PENTHOUSE (LIMBO) - CONTINUOUS

Cobb and Ariadne step off the lift and into the incongruous

interior of a craftsman house. They cautiously move down the

corridor towards the back of the house...

                    COBB

          Resilient...

              (turns to Ariadne)

          Highly contagious, and an idea can

          grow. The smallest seed of an idea

          can grow to define or destroy your

          world...

Cobb is staring into the kitchen. Mal is sitting at the

table, back to them, staring out at the porch- the TOWERS of

Limbo stretching off behind it.

                                                        131.

                    MAL

          The smallest idea, such as... "Your

          world is not real."

Cobb hands Ariadne his gun and moves towards Mal.

                    MAL

          A simple little thought that

          changes everything...

Ariadne watches as Cobb sits down beside Mal. And we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

Arthur FLIES back down the shaft to the top of the elevator,

SQUEEZES past the car to the bottom and starts to set the

MAIN CHARGES ACROSS THE BOTTOM OF THE CAR, and we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. PENTHOUSE (LIMBO) - DAY

Cobb touches Mal's arm- she TURNS, angry. It is only now that

we see that she holds a CARVING KNIFE. Mal looks at Ariadne.

                     MAL

          So certain of your world. Of what's

          real. Do you think he is-

               (points at Cobb)

          Or do you think he's as lost as I

          was?

                    COBB

          I know what's real.

                    MAL

          What are the distinguishing

          characteristics of a dream? Mutable

          laws of physics? Tell that to the

          quantum physicists. Reappearance of

          the dead? What about heaven and

          hell? Persecution of the dreamer,

          the creator, the messiah? They

          crucified Christ, didn't they?

                    COBB

          I know what's real.

                    MAL

          No creeping doubts? Not feeling

          persecuted, Dom? Chased around the

          globe by anonymous corporations and

          police forces? The way the

          projections persecute the dreamer?

                                                       132.

Mal puts her hand on his face. Pitying.

                    MAL

          Admit it, Dom. You don't believe in

          one reality anymore. So choose.

          Choose your reality like I did.

          Choose to be here. Choose me.

                    COBB

              (rising anger)

          I have chosen, Mal. Our children. I

          have to get back to them. Because

          you left them. You left us.

                    MAL

          You're wrong, Dom. You're confused...

          our children are here-

A child's SHOUT draws Cobb- James CROUCHES on the porch, back

to us. Philippa joins him, also turned away. Cobb watches,

moved. Mal leans in close.

                    MAL

              (whispers)

          And you'd like to see their faces

          again, wouldn't you, Dom?

                    COBB

          Our real children are waiting for

          me up above.

And we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

Arthur scrambles to arrange the sleepers on the floor of the

car- as his hand comes away from Saito, he sees BLOOD on it.

He looks at Saito's belly- the blood is coming through his

shirt. Arthur sticks headphones on sleeping Eames, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. HOSPITAL FORTRESS - DAY

Eames throws a GRENADE, blowing up the security forces trying

to ascend the terraces. He DUCKS to the ground to avoid HEAVY

FIRE- starts unpacking the charges and setting them along the

base of the terraces-

                                                       133.

INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Saito looks up as he hears a Security Guard climbing through

the duct... he raises his gun, TREMBLING with weakness...

And we-

INT. KITCHEN, PENTHOUSE (LIMBO) - DAY

Mal laughs at Cobb.

                    MAL

              (laughs)

          Up above? Listen to yourself. You

          judged me for believing the very

          same thing.

Mal points at the children-

                    MAL

          These are our children. Watch.

              (turns to the kids)

          Hey, James! Philippa?!

The children START TO TURN to us- BUT COBB CLOSES HIS EYES.

                    COBB

          They're not real, Mal. Our real

          children are waiting for us-

The children run off. Cobb opens his eyes.

                    MAL

          You keep telling yourself that but

          you don't believe it-

                       COBB

          I know it-

                    MAL

          And what if you're wrong? What if

          I'm what's real?

Cobb is silent.

                    MAL

          You keep telling yourself what you

          know... but what do you believe?

          What do you feel?

Cobb looks at Mal. Struggling.

                    COBB

          Guilt. I feel guilt. And however

          confused I might get.

                    (MORE)

                                                       134.

                    COBB (CONT'D)

          However lost I might seem... it's

          always there. Telling me something.

          Reminding me of the truth.

                    MAL

          What truth?

                    COBB

          That you were wrong to doubt our

          world. That the idea that drove you

          to question your reality was a

          lie...

                    MAL

          How could you know it was a lie?

                    COBB

          Because it was my lie.

                    MAL

              (realizing)

          Because you planted the idea in my

          mind.

                     COBB

          Because I performed inception on my

          own wife, then reaped the bitter

          rewards...

                    ARIADNE

          Why?

                    COBB

          We'd become lost in here. Living in

          a world of infinite possibilities.

          A world where we were gods. I

          realized we needed to escape, but

          she'd locked away her knowledge of

          the unreality of this world...

INSERT CUT: Mal opens the doll's house. Takes the spinning

top, lies it down in the safe. LOCKS IT AWAY.

                    COBB

          I couldn't make Mal understand that

          we needed to break free. To die. So

          I started to search our world...

Cobb turns to Mal, but keeps talking to Ariadne...

INSERT CUT: Cobb WANDERS the streets of Limbo...

                    COBB

          Searching for the right place in

INSERT CUT: Cobb stops outside the VICTORIAN HOUSE, MAL'S

CHILDHOOD HOME, looking up at it. He heads inside...

                    COBB

          And when I found that place, that

          secret place where she had shut

          away her knowledge years before, I

          broke it open...

INSERT CUT: Cobb looks around Mal's childhood bedroom. Comes

to the doll's house...

                    COBB

          I broke into the deepest recess of

          her mind, to give her the simplest

          little idea.

INSERT CUT: Cobb throws open the safe doors. Sitting on the

shelf of the safe is a spinning top. On its side.

                    COBB

          A truth that she had once known,

          but had chosen to forget...

INSERT CUT: Cobb picks up the totem. He SPINS it in the safe.

IT SPINS AND SPINS WITHOUT END. Cobb CLOSES THE DOOR of the

safe...

                    COBB

          That her world was not real.

INSERT CUT: COBB AND MAL ARRIVE AT TRAIN TRACKS CUTTING

THROUGH WASTELAND.

                    COBB (V.O.)

          That death was a necessary escape.

They lie on the tracks looking into each other's eyes. Mal is

crying. Cobb takes her hand, reassuring. He starts to speak-

                    COBB

          You're waiting for a train. A train

          that will take you far away. You

          know where you hope this train will

          take you, but you can't know for

          sure. Yet it doesn't matter...

Mal looks at him across the railroad tracks. Replies-

                    MAL

          Because you'll be together.

The train comes, OBLITERATING the lovers.

Back in the present- Cobb looks into Mal's eyes. She is

crying.

                                                       136.

                    COBB

          I never thought that the idea I'd

          planted would grow in her mind like

          a cancer. That even after we woke...

INSERT CUT: Cobb looks around the HOTEL SUITE, confused. He

moves to the CURTAINS... Mal is on the ledge opposite.

                    COBB

          You'd continue to believe that your

          world was not real...

Crying, Mal nods-

                    MAL

          That death was the only escape?

INSERT CUT: Mal PLUNGES to her death.

                    MAL

          You killed me.

Cobb looks at Mal. Whispers-

                    COBB

          I was trying to save you-I'm sorry.

Mal comes in close to Cobb. Looks him over.

                    MAL

          You infected my mind. You betrayed

          me. But you can make amends. You

          can still keep your promise. We can

          still be together... right here. In

          our world. The world we built

          together.

Cobb stares at Mal. Mesmerized.

                    MAL

          Fischer's on the porch.

Ariadne looks up as a LARGE BOLT OF LIGHTNING RIPS across the

below the rail.

                    ARIADNE

          He's here. And it's time. But you

          have to come with us.

Another massive lightning strike flickers across the sky-

                    ARIADNE

          Cobb, I'm not going to let you lose

          yourself in here! You have to get

          back to your children!

                    COBB

          Send Fischer, I have to stay-

                    ARIADNE

          You can't stay here to be with her-

Cobb turns from Mal. Looks at Ariadne.

                    COBB

          I'm not. Saito is dead by now. That

          means he's here. I have to stay

          here and find him.

Ariadne removes Fischer's gag- pulls him up, onto the rail.

Cobb looks back at Mal.

                    COBB

          I can't stay here to be with her

          because she's not real.

Mal looks at Cobb, furious.

          Not real? I'm the only thing you do

          believe in anymore. Here-doesn't

          I wish you were. But I couldn't

          make you real. I'm not capable of

          imagining you in all your

          complexity and... perfection. As

          you really were. You're the best I

          can do. And you're not real.

Mal pulls the knife and moves to STRIKE again-

                    ARIADNE

          No!

A SHOT rings out, Mal GRABS her shoulder- Cobb turns to

Ariadne, who is pointing Cobb's gun.

                    COBB

          What're you doing?

                    ARIADNE

          Improvising.

She KICKS Fischer off the roof- AIMS again at Mal-

Fischer DROPS as the sky LIGHTS UP WITH ELECTRICITY- Fischer

SCREAMS, then GASPS, no longer falling, and we are-

INT. ANTECHAMBER - DAY

Eames pulls the defibrillator from Fischer's chest as he

COUGHS AWAKE.

                    EAMES

          Get in there-quick!

Fischer looks up at the double doors. STAGGERS to his feet.

Fischer pushes open the doors to the STRONGROOM.

INT. STRONGROOM - CONTINUOUS

Fischer walks into the silent white room. At one end of the

room is a bed. A figure lies in the bed. His FATHER.

Breathing with tremendous difficulty. Dying. And we-

                                                     CUT TO:

EXT. PENTHOUSE (LIMBO) - DAY

Ariadne takes aim at Mal-

                    COBB

          No!

Cobb holds Ariadne's gaze. She lowers the gun. And we-

                                                     CUT TO:

                                                        140.

Eames GRABS the detonator- then moves to the door of the

strongroom...

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. ELEVATOR, HOTEL - NIGHT

Arthur HITS THE DETONATOR-

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - CONTINUOUS

The CHARGES on the bottom of the elevator EXPLODE, and we

move into EXTREME SLOW MOTION as the flames BALLOON-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. STRONGROOM - CONTINUOUS

A RUMBLE BUILDS as Fischer approaches the bed, overcome with

emotion. His Father sees him. Starts trying to speak. Fischer

leans in...

                    FATHER

              (hoarse whisper)

          I... was ... dis ... dis ...

                    FISCHER

          I know, Dad. You were disappointed

          that I couldn't be you.

The dying man SHAKES HIS HEAD with surprising energy.

                    FATHER

              (whisper)

          I was disappointed... that you

          tried.

Fischer hears this. And we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

The elevator car is ROCKETED along its track by the explosion-

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Arthur is SMASHED against the floor of the car next to the

sleepers who SHUDDER with the force of ACCELERATION- and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. ANTECHAMBER - DAY

Eames WATCHES Fischer-

                                                       141.

                    EAMES

              (to himself) )

          Come on, come on...

INT. STRONGROOM - DAY

The Father collapses back onto the pillow. Fischer starts to

weep. His Father reaches out a trembling hand but when

Fischer tries to hold IT, he SHAKES his son's hand away...

He is reaching for the SAFE next to his bed. His fingers

fumble at the keypad, he can't open it. His son pushes

5,2,8,4,9,1 into the keypad. Opens it. Inside the safe is the

WILL. And beside it is a HOMEMADE PINWHEEL, clearly made by a

child. By Fischer. He takes it out, MARVELING at it. He turns

to his father, but his father is dead.

Eames, watching from the door, HITS THE DETONATOR-

EXT. HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

A line of EXPLOSIONS RIPS ALONG THE LOWER WALL... the ENTIRE

BUILDING STARTS TO SLIDE DOWN THE MOUNTAIN-

EXT. PENTHOUSE (LIMBO) - DAY

A FIERCE WIND starts HOWLING through the house as the sky

outside DARKENS. Cobb shields Mal against the blast- looks up

at Ariadne, who HOLDS the railing, FIGHTING the wind-

                    COBB

          That's the kick-you have to go!

                    ARIADNE

          You're coming!

                    COBB

          No, I'm not. I'm staying here to

          find Saito.

              (turns to Mal)

          And to say goodbye.

Ariadne loosens her grip on the railing...

                    ARIADNE

          Don't lose yourself. Find Saito.

          And bring him back.

                    COBB

          I will.

Ariadne lets the wind pull her off the edge- FALLING- and we-

INT. ANTECHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

Ariadne DROPS as the FLOOR COLLAPSES- her eyes SNAP OPEN-

                                                          142.

EXT. PENTHOUSE (LIMBO) - DAY

Cobb holds Mal in his arms. The wind DIES...

                    MAL

          We'd be together forever. You

          promised me.

                    COBB

          I know. But we can't. And I'm

          sorry.

                    MAL

          You remember when you asked me to

          marry you? You said you dreamt that

          we'd grow old together.

                    COBB

          And we did...

Mal looks at Cobb... thinking. Remembering.

INSERT CUT: TWO ELDERLY PEOPLE (MAL AND COBB) WALK THROUGH

LIMBO... ACROSS A WASTELAND... TWO ELDERLY HANDS CLUTCH EACH

OTHER AS THEY LIE DOWN ON THE RAILROAD TRACK...

                    COBB

          I miss you more than I can bear...

          but we had our time together. And

          now I have to let go...

She nods, weakly. Cobb holds Mal as her eyes close...

DYING... and we-

INT. STRONGROOM - CONTINUOUS

Fischer and his Father's body DROP AWAY-

INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

Ariadne DROPS inside the ROCKETING ELEVATOR, and as it

SMASHES INTO THE TOP OF THE SHAFT Ariadne SMASHES into-

INT./EXT. VAN INTO RIVER - DAY

THE WATER, THE VAN CRUNCHING WITH THE IMPACT- WATER CRASHING

THROUGH THE BROKEN WINDOWS FLOODING THE INTERIOR...

Fischer's EYES OPEN, PANICKING- he UNBUCKLES HIMSELF, pushes

out of the broken window- STOPS, goes back to UNBUCKLE

Browning and DRAG him out.

                                                       143.

EXT. RIVER - CONTINUOUS

Fischer breaks the surface with Browning, who COUGHS and

GASPS. He starts PULLING for the near bank, struggling

through the rain-impacted water-

INT. VAN, UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

Ariadne, Arthur and Yusuf wait calmly underwater. They are

sharing TWO REGULATORS pulled from beneath the front seat.

Arthur turns to Saito. There is blood in the water around

Saito's belly- his eyes are LIFELESS- Arthur feels for a

pulse... turns to Cobb, whose eyes are lifeless... Ariadne

GRABS Arthur's elbow, pulling him away...

EXT. RIVERBANK - MOMENTS LATER

Fischer turns Browning/Eames over. They lie there, exhausted.

                    BROWNING

          I'm sorry, Robert.

Fischer stares at the rain on the water.

                    FISCHER

          The will means that Dad wanted me

          to be my own man, not live for him.

              (turns to Browning) )

          And I'm going to, Uncle Peter.

Browning nods. Wipes the rain from his face. In the puddle

beside them, the reflection is not Browning, but Eames.

EXT. UNDERNEATH BRIDGE IN THE RAIN - MOMENTS LATER

Arthur sits on the riverbank, breathing heavily.

                    ARTHUR

          What happened?

                    ARIADNE

          Cobb stayed.

                      ARTHUR

          With Mal?

                    ARIADNE

          No. To find Saito.

Arthur looks out at the water below the bridge.

                    ARTHUR

          He'll be lost...

                    ARIADNE

          No. He'll be alright.

                                                       144.

And we-

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT. DAWN. CRASHING SURF.

The waves TOSS a BEARDED MAN onto wet sand.

As the Japanese Security Guard turns him onto his back, we

realize that this is Cobb- OLDER. WEARY. TRAVELLED...

INT. DINING ROOM, CASTLE - DAY

Cobb WOLFS his food. The Elderly Japanese Man (Saito, 90

years old) watches him.

                    SAITO

          So... have you come to kill me?

Cobb does not look up.

                    SAITO

          I've been waiting for someone to

          come for me...

                    COBB

          Someone from your half-remembered

          dream...?

Saito peers at Cobb.

                    SAITO

          Cobb? Not possible-he and I were

          young men together. And I am an old

          man...

                    COBB

          Filled with regret?

Saito REMEMBERS, nods...

                    SAITO

          Waiting to die alone, yes.

Cobb is STARING at something on the table.

                    COBB

          I came back for you... I came to

          remind you of what you once knew...

Cobb gestures at the table. Saito follows his gaze down to

the polished surface of the table...

                    COBB

          That this world is not real.

                                                       145.

The top IS STILL SPINNING PERFECTLY, AS IF IT WILL NEVER

TOPPLE. Saito looks at the top. Then back to Cobb.

                    SAITO

          You came to convince me to honor

          our arrangement?

                    COBB

          Yes. And to take a leap of faith.

As Saito-san listens to Cobb, he looks at the GUN on the

table between them...

                    COBB

          Come back and we'll be young men

          together again.

The elderly Saito looks at Cobb. Nods. And we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN, 747 - DAY

Ariadne watches Cobb. His eyes are closed.

                    FLIGHT ATTENDANT (O.S.)

          Hot towel, sir?

His EYES FLICKER OPEN. He takes the towel with a nod. Ariadne

smiles. Relieved.

                    FLIGHT ATTENDANT

          We'll be landing in Los Angeles in

          about twenty minutes. Do you need

          immigration forms?

Cobb nods. Takes a landing card. Looks around the cabin.

Saito is WATCHING him. Serious. Haunted. Holding Cobb's gaze,

SAITO PICKS UP THE PHONE AND DIALS. Cobb nods thanks...

INT. ARRIVALS, LAX - LATER

Cobb steps forwards to the IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL. Hands him

his passport. Nervous. The Official takes a beat, looks Cobb

up and down, then WHUMP!- the passport is stamped. As Cobb

takes it back, he spots Ariadne at the next counter. She nods

at him. He nods back. Then moves off...

As Cobb passes through baggage claim, he exchanges subtle

greetings with Eames and Yusuf.

Arthur smiles broadly at Cobb. Cobb brushes past Fischer, who

glances back at him as if thinking maybe he should know him,

then moves on...

                                                          146.

As Cobb emerges into the crowded arrivals hall, he spots

Professor Miles, waving at him...

INT. KITCHEN, COBB AND MAL'S HOUSE - DAY

Cobb enters with Miles. Drops his bags. Moves to the table,

looking out at the overgrown garden. He reaches into his

pocket, takes out his pewter spinning top, lowers it to the

table and SPINS IT- a CHILD'S SHOUT makes him look up-

Through the window, James and Philippa have run into view,

playing, THEIR FACES TURNED AWAY... Cobb STARES at the back

of his children's heads... Miles moves to the window and

KNOCKS on the glass-

James and Philippa TURN- see their Dad. He steps to the

window, watching their BRIGHT FACES SHINING as they run

towards him...

Behind him, on the table, the spinning top is STILL SPINNING.

And we-

FADE OUT.

CREDITS.

END.
