          SEQ. 75 - PROLOGUE

                         FADE IN:

          A cave painting of the Dreamworks logo. Push past the

          moon to the sun. Bright. Beautiful. The sun DISSOLVES

                         TO:

          Cave paintings of a family of cavemen -- we will come to

          know them as The Croods.

                          EEP (V.O.)

           With every sun comes a new day. A new

           beginning. A hope that things will be

           better today than they were yesterday.

          The Croods scurry out of their cave like mice looking for

          food. Scared. Fast.

          The Croods are chased by beasts across the desert. They

          escape from creatures up trees. They hide behind rocks.

                          EEP (V.O.)

           But not for me. My name's Eep. This, is

           my family, the Croods. If you weren't

           clued in already by the animal skins and

           sloping foreheads - we're cavemen. Most

           days we spend in our cave, in the dark.

           Night after night, day after day. Yep.

           Home sweet home. When we did go out, we

           struggled to find food in a harsh and

           hostile world. And I struggled to

           survive my family.

          The Croods are chased by beasts across the desert. They

          escape from creatures up trees. They hide behind rocks.

                          EEP (V.O.)

           We were the last ones around. There used

           to be neighbors. The Gorts, smashed by a

           mammoth. The Horks, swallowed by a sand

           snake. The Erfs, mosquito bite. Throgs,

           common cold. And, the Croods. That's

           us. The Croods made it...

          Grug protects his family from a GIANT BEAR OWL.

                          EEP (V.O.)

           Because of my Dad. He was strong... and

           he followed the rules.

          A shadow falls across their feet and Grug ushers his

          family home.

          2.

                          EEP (V.O.)

           ... the ones painted on the cave walls.

           Anything new is bad, curiosity is bad,

           going out at night is bad. Basically,

           anything fun is bad. Welcome to my

           world.

          They all run back into the cave where Grug slams the rock

          door closed.

          SLOWLY LIGHT ON CAVE PAINTINGS COMES UP AGAIN. But this

          time the light casts an ominous tone.

                          EEP (V.O.)

           But this is a story about how all that

           changed in an instant.

          RAPID SHOTS OF THE GREAT SPLIT CUTTING THROUGH THE LAND.

          HEADED TOWARDS CROOD VALLEY.

          SHOTS OF CATACLYSM. CUT FASTER AND FASTER UNTIL...

                          EEP (V.O.)

           Because what we didn't know, was that our

           world was about to come to an end. And

           there were no rules on our cave walls to

           prepare us for that.

          CAVEMAN HANDS PRESS against the rock wall. They PUSH. A

          BLINDING LIGHT FLOODS the screen.

                          CUT TO:

          SEQ. 100 - MEET THE CROODS

          A HUGE CAVEMAN, GRUG, RUSHES forward, screaming,

          growling, and throwing handfuls of dirt in a THREAT

          DISPLAY. He BLINKS in the bright morning light. He

          LIFTS and HURLS a large boulder.

                          GRUG

           Raaaaar grooooOOOOoooowwwll ERF ERF

           Glaaaaaabbbbllllllllthhhh!

          As suddenly as he began, Grug stops. Panting, he waits

          for the echoes of his outburst to fade.

          Grug TURNS to the cave entrance, he prepares to BELLOW a

          signal, but before any sound escapes his lips--

          A CAVE GIRL, EEP, bursts from the cave.

          3.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           You're supposed to wait for my signal

           Eep. Eep?

          Eep scares a pack of nearby Liyotes away. They pounce on

          Grug briefly before scampering off. Eep spreads out on

          an overhanging rock. She BASKS IN THE SUN.

                          EEP

           We've been in that cave forever.

                          GRUG

           Three days is not forever.

                          EEP

           It is with this family.

                          GRUG

           Eep would you come down here? You're

           being so dramatic.

          A LITTLE GIRL, SANDY, charges out next. Her display is

          more terrier-like.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           No, no, no Sandy, come back here.

           Remember the signal. Good girls wait for

           the signal.

          A CAVE WOMAN, UGGA, scrambles out next. She is mostly

          focused on catching Sandy, giving only cursory effort to

          her display.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Ugga.

                          UGGA

           As soon as I get Sandy, I'll go back in,

           and you can give the signal.

                          GRUG

           No, I mean, you're already out now.

           THUNK (O.S.)

           I am waiting for the signal, dad.

          We HEAR the voice of Grug's nine-year-old son from inside

          the cave. THUNK is eager to please his dad and emulates

          his every move.

                          GRUG

           Never mind, Thunk. Just, come out.

          4.

                          THUNK

           (not so fast)

           Uhh, but if you don't give the signal,

           how do I know you're my dad?

                          GRUG

           The signal isn't so you know it's me,

           it's so you know I wasn't eaten by an

           animal.

          Beat.

                          THUNK

           Then why is the signal an animal noise?

           I mean, doesn't that just confuse things?

          Grug sighs.

                          THUNK (CONT'D)

           I don't know... I'm still waiting for the

           signal.

                          GRUG

           Sigh. Hoo hooooo! Hoo hooooo!

          Thunk comes out growling, and barrels into Grug. Thunk

          picks up a boulder and throws it. It ricochets off the

          cliff wall and careens into Grug. Grug gets plowed over

          by the boulder.

                          UGGA

           Mom, we're ready to leave.

                          (BEAT)

           Mom!

          Grug sits up and smiles.

                          GRAN

           Still alive!

          Grug's face drops.

                          GRUG

           It's still early.

                          GRAN

           And you're still fat.

                          GRUG

           Breakfast formation!

          The Croods form up in a flying wedge, with Grug in the

          lead.

          5.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           I want to see some real caveman action

           out there. We do this fast. We do this

           loud, we do this as a family and never

           not be afraid. Go!

                          THUNK

           YAY, BREAKFAST!!!!

          COMPRESSED TIME - The Croods RUN out of Crood canyon,

          across the wide expanses of desert.

                          CUT TO:

          SEQ. 150 - SMASH & GRAB

          EXT. MOUTH OF CROOD CANYON - MORNING

          Grug and the Croods come to a stop at the HUNTING

          GROUNDS. They are spent from a fifteen-mile run.

                          THUNK

                          (HUFFING)

           Yeah... breakfast...

          We see a nest with a huge unguarded blue egg. The Croods

          take shelter behind a rock. Grug PEERS over the top.

                          GRUG

           Who's up?

          Eep's hand SHOOTS up. Thunk is less than enthusiastic.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           We'll flip for it.

          Grug LIFTS Gran on his hand, and FLIPS her up in the air.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Call her in the air.

                          EEP

           Heads.

          Gran FACE-PLANTS, her head buried in the sand. Only her

          tail is showing.

                          GRUG

           Tails. Thunk's in.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Positions.

          6.

          The family fades back and splits up. They get into

          fighting/running position.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Ok. Thunk. Go. Come on Thunk.

          Thunk BREAKS COVER. He dashes into the open, SNATCHES

          the egg.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Hah! Way to go. Take it to the cave!

          Thunk PASSES Grug and makes a bee-line for Crood Canyon.

          A Gerf bird smashes Thunk and steals the egg back.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Oooh!

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Release the baby.

          Eep and Sandy MOVE IN on the bird. Sandy NIPS at its

          heels while UGGA CLIMBS up onto its head. She PULLS the

          egg from its beak.

          Down range, TRIP GERBILS SURFACE. They STRETCH their

          shared tail across the Ramu's path like an arresting

          cable on a carrier.

          Ugga RISES to THROW the egg to Grug - the gerbils WRAP

          their tail around the Ramu like a bola. The Ramu GOES

          DOWN hard. Ugga and the egg ROLL forward. The Trip

          Gerbils SNATCH up the egg and make off with it.

                          UGGA

           Get um Mom! Do it for the Croods!

          Gran's cane HOOKS the gerbils in the middle of their tail

          and WHIPS them up and over her shoulder.

                         ON GRAN

          DRIBBLING the egg down-range with her cane like a hockey

          player. LIYOTES POP UP from behind hoodoos. They SWARM

          in behind her.

          The Liyotes TRIP Gran. They steal the egg, and HIT THE

          GAS. They are INCREDIBLY FAST.

                          GRAN

           Old lady down! Eep, avenge me.

          7.

                         ON EEP

          Crouched in the shade of a scrubby bush, like a runner on

          the blocks - she has the Liyotes in her sights. Eep

          LAUNCHES.

          Eep runs after the Liyote with the egg, cutting him off

          in his tracks he slams into a cactus launching the egg

          into the air. Eep leaps into the air taking back the egg.

                          EEP

           Thanks!

          A bunch of Jackrobats see Eep and swarm around her. She

          loses her footing and throws the egg to Grug.

                          GRUG

           Eep!

                          EEP

           Heads Up!

          Grug catches the egg and runs by the entrance of a small

          cave. Thunk following close behind accidentally trips

          over the tail of a sleeping Bear Owl knocking Grug to the

          ground and fumbling the egg once again.

          Thunk catches the egg just as the Girelephant bears down

          on him from behind and lifts him onto one of its tusks.

          The family members meet up as they begin their long run

          back to the cave.

          An entire swarm of animals chase the Croods as they head

          back to their cave.

          The Bear Owl is awakened and goes after everyone on the

          chase.

          Grug protecting his family from the BearOwl tosses each

          family member onto the Girelephant's back.

          Grug dodges the BearOwl's attack and uses him as a

          launching pad to get himself safely on the Girelephant.

          Thunk is happy to see Dad is safe.

                          THUNK

           Oh hey Dad, can we eat now?

                          GRUG

           Just wait till we get home. Eep put on

           the brakes.

          The entrance to Crood canyon appears on the horizon.

          8.

          Eep hangs off the edge of one of its tusks as Grug takes

          over the other. Together they dig their heels into the

          ground, slowing down the Girelephant.

          The Bearowl continues the chase. The Croods maneuver the

          Girelephant to fend off the Bearowl.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Eep!

          The Girelephant moving way too fast readies for the

          crash. The Girelephant crashes into the entrance of the

          canyon, sending the Croods flying in. They all tumble.

          Grug makes an extraordinary football catch. He holds

          tight to the meal as he slams into a rock. Grug holds up

          the egg.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Who's hungry?

                          THUNK

           Alright! Good one, dad!

                          GRUG

           Here you go, Thunk. Drink up.

          Grug tosses the egg to Thunk, Thunk fumbles it and it

          cracks open.

                          THUNK

           Sorry, dad.

                          UGGA

           Looks like fast food tonight!

          The family passes the leaky egg around quickly, each

          Crood gets a taste. Thunk is the last Crood to get a

          mouthful, he hands it over to Grug-- the egg is empty.

                          GRUG

           That's alright. I ate last week.

          A SHADOW TOUCHES Grug's feet. He looks up - the sun is

          setting behind the canyon wall. He HOLDS UP his hand to

          gauge how much daylight is left.

                          GRAN

           Two knuckle warning.

                          UGGA

           Come on Croods. Go, go, go.

                          CUT TO:

          9.

          SEQ. 200 - WELCOME TO CROOD CAVE

          INT. CROOD CAVE - EVENING

                          GRUG

           Come on, come on. Darkness brings death!

           We know this.

          The Croods RUN INSIDE THE CAVE. Ugga picks up a heavy

          stick off the floor.

                          UGGA

           The moon is full. Bath night.

           (grumbling, Gran tries to run

                          AWAY)

           You too, Mom.

                          GRAN

           Run for your life.

          Ugga pulls Gran back.

                          GRAN (CONT'D)

           I don't want to lose my protective layer.

                          UGGA

           Mom, you've got ants.

           (hanging Sandy up)

          Whack! Like she's cleaning a rug, Ugga SMACKS Sandy hard

          with the stick. Dust and bugs fly off of her.

                          UGGA (CONT'D)

           See? Sandy doesn't fuss.

          Ugga CLAPS her hands together and Sandy knows to let go.

          She hits the floor and SCAMPERS away.

                          GRAN

                          (UPSET)

           Aaaaaaaaaah.

          Grug enters and looks around the cave.

                          GRUG

           Is she still out there?

                          UGGA

           You know she hates the cave, Grug.

          ON EEP clinging to the side of the sheer rock face above

          Crood cave. She RAISES HER HAND to `catch' a few more

           Please come back tomorrow.

          ON GRUG getting his `bath.'

                          GRUG

           How can she not like the cave? It's so

           cozy.

                          UGGA

           It is a little, dark, Grug.

                          GRUG

           It's not that dark.

          Grug is finished with his bath.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

                          (LOSING PATIENCE)

           Eep! Eep?

          Eep begins to climb down the wall outside when she hears

          a sound in the distance. Curious, she begins to climb

          even higher. Grug leaves the cave, searching for her.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Come on, I gotta close the cave...

          ON GRUG exiting the cave... Grug sees that Eep is at the

          very top.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Eep!

          Eep continues to climb.

                          EEP

           Okay, okay!

                          GRUG

           Come on.

          Behind Grug, the Bear Owl appears up the canyon. It

          SPOTS Grug and the open cave and RACES to attack. Grug

          sees the BearOwl in full attack mode.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           EEP! COME DOWN!!

          Grug throws a rock which momentarily stuns the creature,

          allowing Eep to JUMP DOWN and DART into the cave. Grug

          barely gets the cave closed in time.

          11.

          SEQ. 210 - BEDTIME STORY

          The Bear Owl PUSHES his paw through the narrow opening,

          and FEELS around for the Croods. The Croods are like

          mice in this world.

                          GRUG

           That was too close!

                          EEP

           I was watching. I was fine.

                          GRUG

           What were you doing up there, Eep?

                          EEP

           I don't know.

                          GRUG

           What were you looking for?

                          EEP

           Nothing.

                          GRUG

           Well then why did you go up there?

                          EEP

                          (ANNOYED)

           I don't know.

                          GRUG

           Why don't you know? Stop looking for

           things. Fear keeps us alive Eep. Never

           not be afraid.

          Eep climbs up on a ledge and curls up in the corner where

          a tiny spot of light seeps in.

                          EEP

                          (TO HERSELF)

           What's the point of all this?

                          GRUG

           Hmmm? What was that?

          12.

                          EEP

           (a little louder)

           I mean, why are we here? What are we

           doing this for?

           No one said survival was fun.

                          EEP

           Nothing is fun.

                          GRUG

           Hmm? Would you come down here. Eep?

          No answer. Grug CLIMBS up. Ugga PULLS Grug back down.

                          UGGA

           Grug. Off.

                          GRUG

           Yes.

          Grug climbs back up.

                          UGGA

           Off!

                          GRUG

           I just don't see why she needs her own

           ledge. That's all. That's what this is

           about.

                          UGGA

           She's working through some things and

           needs her own space.

                          GRUG

           What things? How long is this going to

           take? Really? I mean she already

           doesn't listen to me.

          A pebble hits Grug in the head. It came from Eep's

          ledge.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Hey!

                          UGGA

           See? She's listening.

          13.

                          GRUG

           If she wants to survive, she has to

           follow our rules.

                          UGGA

           How about a story? Eep loves those.

          Grug brightens.

                          GRUG

                          (BRIGHTENING)

           That's a good idea ... How about a story,

           huh?

                          THUNK

           Oh yeah, tell us a story.

          The Croods minus Eep gather in a semi-circle on the

          ground. Grug retrieves Sandy and her Krispy Bear from

          the bone-crib.

                          GRUG

           Ok. Can I borrow that? Thank you. Eep!

           Your old favorite?

                          EEP

           I haven't played with that thing in

           years.

                          GRUG

           Tonight we'll hear the story of Krispy

           Bear.

          Grug sits and waits a beat for Eep to join, but she stays

          put.

          As Grug talks, he gestures at a rough sketch on the wall

          of the cave.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           A long time ago, this little bear was

           alive. She was alive because she

           listened to her father and lived her life

           in routine and darkness and terror. So

           she was happy. But Krispy had one,

           terrible problem. She was filled with...

           curiosity.

                          UGGA

           Grug!

          Ugga covers Sandy's ears.

          14.

                          GRUG

           Yes. And one day, while she was in a

           tree, the curious little bear wanted to

           climb to the top.

                          THUNK

           Wha?

                          GRUG

           And no sooner than she climbed to the

           top, she saw something new and died.

          Grug SWATS the painting.

                          THUNK

           Just like that?

                          GRUG

           Yes! Her last moments of terror still

           frozen on her face.

          Grug holds out Krispy Bear. The family is terrified.

                          GRAN

           Oh, same ending as everyday.

                          THUNK

                          (FREAKED OUT)

           I get it, dad. I get it. I will never

           do anything new or different.

                          GRUG

           Good man, Thunk.

          Pan across the walls to reveal they are covered with

          stories all seemingly with the same ending.

                          UGGA

           Alright, everyone sharpen your teeth and

           let's pile up.

          All their worst fears confirmed, the Croods snuggle into

          one big heap, warm and comfy. Grug casts a glance to

          Eep's ledge. She doesn't budge.

           FADE TO BLACK:

          SEQ. 500 - FOLLOW THE LIGHT

          15.

          INT. CROOD CAVE - NIGHT

          The Croods sleep peacefully in their pile. Except Eep,

          who tosses restlessly on her LEDGE. Outside, we hear the

          ROARS and HOWLS of prehistoric creatures fighting.

          But then, SILENCE.

          And then cutting through the primordial night is a

          MUSICAL SOUND. Unsettling. Unearthly. Eep creeps

          around her sleeping family and cautiously approaches the

          "door" to peer outside, when suddenly--

          WHOOSH! A bright light blazes through the gaps around

          the boulder door, bathing Eep in an OTHER-WORLDLY GLOW.

          She chases the flash of light around the cave trying to

          catch it in her hands.

          Eep presses her face against the cold boulder, trying to

          get a look at what is outside, but she can't get more

          than a blurred glimpse of the canyon beyond - and the

          disappearing light.

          Desperate to see more, Eep braces her back against the

          cave and PUSHES the plug rock with her legs. Slowly, she

          shifts the rock, careful not to wake her father. It takes

          all of her strength, but she manages to move it just

          enough for her to BARELY SQUEEZE out.

          EXT. CROOD CANYON - CONTINUOUS

          Eep stands outside at night for the first time ever. Her

          heart races. The hot night wind blows against her face

          and through her hair. The forbidden sensation is

          exhilarating.

          The canyon beyond is quickly swallowing the light - it

          will be gone in another few seconds. With one of her

          hands pressed tightly to the cave `door', she steels

          herself.

          Eep LETS GO and DASHES after the light, SCRAMBLING

          through the SANDSTONE NARROWS, bounding from side to

          side. As she disappears into the darkness of the canyon,

          we...

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. CANYON

          The light ahead is growing brighter. Eep is closing on

          it. In her excitement, she missteps and SNAPS a stick

          underfoot.

          16.

          It was barely audible. Eep instinctively FREEZES.

          A huge SHADOW of a TUSKED CREATURE is cast on the wall

          above her. Eep throws a rock at the shadow.

          She POWERS STRAIGHT UP the stone wall with unexpected

          speed.

          The Creature RUNS. Eep tops the wall and...

                          CUT TO:

          SEQ. 550 - CLOSE ENCOUNTERS

          EXT. ROCK ARCH - NIGHT

          Eep steps into a small clearing. Stuck in the ground, is

          a TORCH. As far as Eep knows, this is the thing she was

          following. Eep crouches down and cautiously approaches.

          REVERSE ANGLE - Eep can feel the heat from the fire on

          the palms of her hands and her face. TENSE. EXCITING.

          But camouflaged against the rock wall behind her,

          something MOVES. A WARTHOG CREATURE stands upright and

          creeps up behind her.

          Eep reaches out to TOUCH the flame. The torch blows away

          from her. The wind has changed direction. The breeze at

          her back, Eep smells the Creature behind her. On her

          face, awe turns to determination as she wheels and grabs

          the creature. She THROWS and FLIPS it over her shoulder.

          It hits the torch, knocking it to the ground. Eep jumps

          back, GRABBING a good-sized rock - she's poised to bash

          the Creature's brains in.

                          CREATURE

           Nuh! Nuh!

          The Creature defensively raises its arms, hands in front

          of its face.

                          GUY

           No!

          Hands? Eep GASPS, shocked to see HUMAN HANDS attached to

          this monstrosity.

          The Creature slowly puts his hands to the sides of his

          grotesque head, and RAISES its mask. It's a boy... he's

          BEAUTIFUL! This is GUY.

          17.

                          EEP

           Augh!

          Eep LEAPS BACK a few paces, DROPPING the rock on Guy's

          foot.

                          GUY

           AAAAAAAUGHHHHHHHH!

                          EEP

           Shhh!

          Eep moves swiftly to silence him. She POUNCES on him and

          TWISTS his head sideways. Guy is SUFFOCATING. He feels

          around for a stick and BASHES Eep in the side of the

          head.

                          EEP (CONT'D)

           Ow!

           ...You talk.

                          GUY

           I'm a person, like you.

          Eep TOSSES the boulder aside and LIFTS Guy with one hand.

                          GUY (CONT'D)

           Sort of... like you.

          Eep OPENS Guy's mouth and pokes around inside. She

          SNIFFS at him. Turns him upside-down.

                          GUY (CONT'D)

           Okay, could you not, hee hee hee, that

           tickles. Hey!

          Eep looks closely at BELT, a sloth wrapped around Guy's

          waist. Belt's eyes OPEN.

                          EEP

           Augh!

          Eep DROPS Guy on his head.

                          GUY

           OW! Wow. --

          Eep jams her foot over Guy's mouth.

          18.

                          EEP

           Quiet! I'm not supposed to be out here.

          Guy BITES her foot.

                          EEP (CONT'D)

           OW!

          She KICKS Guy in the stomach. He ROLLS sideways. Guy is

          getting the worst of this encounter. Eep kicks Guy off-

          frame. We HEAR the fight continuing.

                          GRUG

                          (TO UGGA)

           Eep's gone.

           What? Grug!

                          GRUG

           Stay in the cave!

          Grug stands outside the entrance to the cave. Peering

          into utter darkness. He steels himself... and then

          releases his hand from the "door."

           (in pain, defeated)

           Wow. You're really strong.

          The flame DWINDLES. Guy MOVES toward it. Eep BLOCKS

          him.

                          EEP

           No! It's mine. No, no. I caught it!

          19.

          No way Guy is getting past her.

                          GUY

           It's dying. I can fix it!

          Eep doesn't want to.

                          GUY (CONT'D)

           Please. I hate the dark.

          Eep sees a kindred spirit. She gets out of his way. Guy

          PICKS UP the torch and BLOWS. Eep scoots closer to Guy,

          staying in the circle of light around him. As Guy brings

          the fire back to life, the relief on his face is familiar

          to Eep. This boy seems to have power over light itself.

          Eep is smitten.

                          EEP

           It does what you tell it?

                          GUY

           Well, yeah, sort of.

           No, no. Fire.

           (to the flame)

           Hi, fire.

                          GUY

                          (LAUGHING)

           It's not alive.

                          EEP

           But you said it was dying.

                          GUY

           Uh sorry,--

                          EEP

           It comes from where you come from?

                          GUY

           No. I make it.

          Eep BALLS her fist, GRABBING Guy tightly by the hair.

                          EEP

           Make some for me.

          20.

                          GUY

           Ow. Okay, it doesn't come out of me.

                          EEP

           Make. MAKE! MAKE IT!

          Eep SQUEEZES Guy like a tube of toothpaste.

                          GUY

           You do this a lot.

          Something CRACKS. Eep DROPS Guy - he's broken.

                          EEP

           Are you dead? Can I have your fire if

           you're dead?

          Belt RUBS two flat rocks together and places them on

          Guy's chest like defibrillator paddles. Guy BOLTS

          upright.

                          GUY

           Hey, those are cold!

                          BELT

           Squirf!

                          GUY

           You think? Listening shells, activate.

          Belt AND Guy use shells to LISTEN to the ground.

                          GUY (CONT'D)

           I concur. Tiger girl, we need to leave

           immediately.

          He tries to pull her by the arm. She stays put like an

          anchor.

                          EEP

           I don't even know you.

                          GUY

           (pained, rushed)

           Ow. I'm Guy.

                          EEP

           Guy?

                          GUY

           And this is Belt. Cook,

           conversationalist, navigator, also keeps

           my pants up.

          21.

                          BELT

           Hhiiyaa! Yaaa!

                          EEP

           What are "pants up?"

                          GUY

           Who are you?

                          EEP

           Eep.

                          GUY

           (cutting her off)

           Let me clarify, Eep. The world is

           ending.

                          EEP

           What?

                          GUY

           I'm calling it...

                          (VERY DRAMATIC)

           The... End.

                          BELT

           Da da daaaaa.

                          EEP

           How do you know?

          Guy and Belt both do gestures to accompany the Da da

          daaaa. It seems very important to them.

                          GUY

           I've seen it. It's coming this way.

           First, the Earth is going to shake. Then

           it breaks open. Everything falls in.

           Fire. Lava. I don't mean to sound too

           dramatic, but Aaaaaaaugh. Believe me,

           everything we're standing on, all this

           right here, will be gone.

          Again with the gestures. It's a little weird to Eep.

                          GUY (CONT'D)

           We've got to get to high ground. I know a

           mountain, that way--

          He points into the distance.

          22.

                          GUY (CONT'D)

           It's our only chance.

           (extending his hand)

           Come with me.

          Guy and Belt reach out their hands to Eep.

                          EEP

           I can't.

          Guy hands the shell to Eep. And Eep is mesmerized. Guy

          pulls his hog-mask back down.

                          GUY

           Okay. Here. If you survive, call me.

          Eep test-blows the shell. It makes a sound, she giggles.

          When she looks up to thank Guy, he is GONE.

                          EEP

           Thank you. Hello? Hey!

          Eep BUMPS directly into Grug.

                          EEP (CONT'D)

           Dad!

                          GRUG

           Are you hurt? What took you?

                          EEP

           Nothing. I left on my own.

                          GRUG

           You... youuuuuuu... ww-what!?

                          EEP

           Dad, let me explain...

          A low GROWL interrupts them.

          ON THE BEAR OWL Sniffing around. It passes over a log.

          CRANE DOWN to reveal Grug hanging under the log by one

          hand, Eep dangling in the other.

                          EEP (CONT'D)

                          (WHISPERED)

           You never let me talk.

                          GRUG

           You're grounded.

                          CUT TO:

          23.

          SEQ. 610 - EARTHQUAKE

          EXT. CANYON - OUTSIDE THE KEYHOLE - MORNING

          Grug and Eep move up the canyon. Eep furiously kicks a

          rock, it nearly hits Grug.

                          GRUG

           Hey!

          Things are tense between the two. At the KEYHOLE, they

          are met by the rest of the Croods.

                          UGGA

           Eep!

                          EEP

           Mom!

                          UGGA

           Grug! What happened!?

                          GRUG

           You know what, I am so mad right now,

           that I can't talk to her.

                          UGGA

           Eep?

                          EEP

           You'll never believe it. I found

           something new.

                          CROODS

           New?!!!!

          The Croods all SNATCH up stones. They form a defensive

          circle.

                          GRUG

           New's a big problem!

          Eep is trapped in the middle of the defensive formation.

          She SQUEEZES out.

                          EEP

           Wait. Wait!

                          UGGA

           Eep. Stay inside the family kill circle.

                          EEP

           It wasn't bad.

          24.

                          GRUG

           New is always bad.

                          EEP

           No. He was nice.

                          GRUG

           What!? Excuse me? He?

                          EEP

           Oh. Well, I thought he was a warthog,

           but then he turned into a boy.

                          GRAN

           Strange. Usually it's the reverse.

          Grug RAISES an eyebrow.

                          THUNK

           Eep's got a boy hog! Eep's got a boy

           hog!

          Eep ELBOWS Thunk in the back of his head.

                          EEP

           There was a boy. Watch, okay. I'm gonna

           call him.

          Eep pulls out the SHELL. She BLOWS into the shell - the

          sound ALARMS the Croods.

          They SMACK the shell from Eep's hand and SMASH it with

          their rocks.

          Eep is incredulous. The dust clears - the panting Croods

          are satisfied the object is gone.

                          EEP (CONT'D)

           What is wrong with you?

                          GRUG

           It was dangerous.

                          EEP

                          (VERY ANGRY)

           It was beautiful. You want to see

           dangerous? Here.

          She pelts Thunk with a rock.

                          THUNK

           Owww! My sniffer!

          25.

                          GRUG

           Okay Eep, that's it. We're going back to

           the cave and you're going to stay in

           there until you're older than... her!

                          EEP

           What!? You can't keep me inside forever!

          Eep throws a tantrum of epic proportion. She SLAMS a

          rock on the ground. It SHATTERS to dust.

          CREAK! A strange GROAN is heard from under the ground.

          Then a small amount of sand falls from up above. A crack

          starts to splinter under their feet.

                          EEP (CONT'D)

           He said this would happen.

          Then BOOM! The ground starts to SHAKE!

                          GRUG

           Get to the cave! GO!

          The Croods RACE through the CANYON NARROWS, fighting

          their way through falling boulders and shifting ground,

          heading towards the safety of their cave.

          The Croods see the cave entrance. The canyon walls above

          their home start to crack. Grug sees that the falling

          rock will crush the cave.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Look out! Stop!

          Grug leaps and tackles his family, protecting them from

          the mass of rocks crashing down.

          The top of the canyon collapses and the Crood's cave is

          destroyed. Everything is engulfed by dust. The earth

          settles.

                          DISSOLVE TO:

          SEQ. 710 - CROSSING OVER

          The dust clears a bit - the Croods are in a tight ball,

          covered by Grug. Grug stands, all Croods were sheltered

          and safe under his mighty arms.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Is everyone okay?

                          UGGA

           Yes. Grug, the cave, it's gone.

          26.

          Grug looks back to Crood cave. It is gone.

                          GRUG

           No.

          Grug searches the rubble for any sign that the cave might

          still be there. He finds one handprint, split in two.

          He carefully fits them back together. Emotional, he

          lowers his head.

          As Eep steps forward, a shaft of light filtering through

          the dusty veil from the wreckage crosses her face--

          As the dust descends, Eep sees A NEW WORLD beyond.

                          EEP

           You really need to see this...

          The dumbfounded Croods stare in awe at the beautiful

          world.

          The Croods look out at the new world.

                          EEP (CONT'D)

           We should go there!

                          GRUG

           No. No one is going anywhere.

          Grug pulls Eep back from the precipice.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           What else did that boy say?

          WHOOSH! Suddenly, bursting from the New World is a giant

          flying creature - a TURTLE DOVE.

          The Croods reel back as it sails overhead. They turn to

          watch the Turtle Dove as it flies away.

          They hear a familiar menacing growl. It's the BEAR OWL!

          It roars and charges toward the Croods.

          Grug instinctively GRABS a giant boulder and rolls it in

          front of his family.

          The Bear Owl runs and swats the massive boulder away like

          a ball of yarn.

          But the Croods are not behind it. They are running

          towards the New World.

          27.

                          UGGA

           Grug?

                          GRUG

           Just go! Go! Go!

          The Croods run towards the precipice with the Bear Owl

          closing in.

          They reach the edge. The Bear Owl dives.

          The Croods LEAP. They hang for a moment and begin

          tumbling down a steep jungle hill.

                          CUT TO:

          SEQ. 776 - NEW WORLD

          EXT. NEW WORLD. DAY

          The Croods tumble through a twisty mess of giant roots

          and strange plants and land in a heap. They all lie on

          their backs, disoriented, but momentarily calm.

          Grug sits up first. He turns to the high, high, cliff

          above them -- to the top, where they have lived all their

          lives up to this moment. A few loose pebbles continue to

          tumble down. There is no sign of the BEAR OWL.

          The others stand up, and they take in this new place.

          Grug takes a deep breath and then quickly counts:

                          GRUG

           One, two, three, four, five --

          BEAT. Grug smiles.

          Gran lands in a heap behind him.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

                          (DEFEATED)

           Six.

                          GRAN

           (winces in pain)

           Oh... Where are we?

                          GRUG

           I don't know, I'm not sure. Down. In a

           lower place. One thing's for sure, we

           can't go back the way we came.

          28.

          The Croods SIT UP. They are disoriented.

                         ON SANDY

                          SANDY

           Sniff sniff sniff 

           Grrrrrrrrrrr..... 

                          UGGA

           (hushed, urgent)

           Sandy? What is it?

          Sandy LUNGES at something almost disappearing into a

          bush.

          Grug BARELY catches Sandy by her leg. Grug PULLS her back

          like a dog on a leash.

                          GRUG

           No, no! Come back, Sandy!

          Sandy has a MOUSEPHANT in her mouth. Grug knocks it from

          Sandy's mouth. A gaggle of mousephants run out from the

          bush and scurry away.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

                          (TENSE WHISPER)

           We can't be out in the open like this.

           We need a cave. Now step where I step.

          They start moving.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

                          (WHISPERS)

           Okay. Stay quiet. Hopefully nothing big

           knows we're here yet.

          PULL BACK - a huge colorful predator, THE MACAWNIVORE

          senses something. He SITS UP and STALKS OFF.

          ON THE CROODS moving fitfully through the strange forest.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Wait. Okay. Wait. Okay. Wait. Okay.

          The Croods cautiously move in fits and stops through the

          middle of this thick, pre-historic rainforest.

                          THUNK

                          (RAMBLING)

           So Dad, just to be clear, are we looking

           for the exact same cave?

                          (MORE)

          29.

                          THUNK (CONT'D)

           If it was me, I'm just throwing this out

           there, if it was me choosing the cave, I

           would go with a smaller cave.

          As they trek, strange creatures (BEAR PEARS, PUNCH

          MONKEYS) watch these foreigners.

          In the front of the line, Grug is freaked out. But in

          the back Eep is taking in the wonders. They pass through

          a curtain of hefty hanging pears. After they pass the

          "pears" all turn to watch the Croods.

          A leaf FLUTTERS down.

                          GRUG

           Wait.

          Eep and Grug LOOK UP.

          WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL THEY ARE SURROUNDED BY PUNCH

          MONKEYS.

                          THUNK

           Dad?

                          GRUG

           I'll take care of this.

          Grug launches into his Threat Display -

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           WWAAAAaaarrgghhaarrraaaarrgghhh!!

          He flails his arms around and jumps about in front of the

          nearest Punch Monkey. No reaction from the Punch Monkey.

          Grug stops, confused... The Punch Monkey now breaks into a

          BROAD GRIN... Then hauls off and - THUD - Punches Grug in

          the face! Grug reels back, surprised - turns... Right into

          another Punch Monkey. It winds up and - THUD! - it hits

          Grug - Grug reels back - into another Monkey - THUD! -

                          THUNK

           Alright dad, go get `em! Oh, oh, now you

           got em-- Now they're really hitting you.

           Dad I got it, just stop running into

           their fists.

          Gran joins in and punches Grug in the nose.

                          GRAN

           Hah, I'm loving this.

          30.

                          UGGA

           Grug, when you're done, we should get

           going.

          Wide shot: Grug is being bounced back and forth like a

          pinball from one punch Monkey to the next. The Punch

          Monkeys are whooping and hollering - this is great fun!

          The Punch Monkeys let go of Grug and begin running away

          for no apparent reason.

          Grug staggers backwards into the family.

                          GRUG

           That's right! You can't get past this!

                          CHUNKY

           ROOOAR!

          A colorful 'bush' rears up - it's not a bush, it's a

          MACAWNIVORE! The Croods react, terrified

          Grug throws a rock at it. The Macawnivore catches the

          rock and SPRINGS! -

                          CROODS

                          GASPS 

                          GRUG

           Climb! Climb! Climb!

          Grug pushes and forces the Croods up a huge tree then as

          it steps away-- it is actually a giant animal.

          GRUG'S POV: A cave!

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           CAVE! GO! GO!

          The Croods jump off the bird leg in hopes of getting to

          the cave.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Come on! Hurry up, let's go! Come on!

          The Croods all RUN LIKE CRAZY in the direction Grug

          pointed. They step inside the "cave." SLAM! The front

          of the cave comes down. The Croods have jumped inside

          the MOUTH of a LAND WHALE!

          31.

                          THUNK

           Hey look! This cave has a tongue.

           Awesome!

                          CUT TO:

          SEQ. 1250 - GUY TO THE RESCUE

          The Land Whale stands up and then SPITS the Croods out

          through its blow hole. The Croods land in a heap.

                          GRUG

           Okay, that's one, two, three, four,

           five... six...

                          GRAN

           And seven... if we're counting Chunky the

           Death Cat.

                          CHUNKY

           Grrrrrrrrr.

          The Macawnivore appears from behind some nearby grass.

          It looks at the Croods with delight. Suddenly, the

          shadow of the setting sky passes over the Macawnivore.

          It freaks out and retreats into the forest.

                          THUNK

           Hah! It's scared of the dark... wait...

           we're scared of the dark.

          And for good reason, because as the SHADOW from the

          setting sun falls across the Croods.

          Suddenly, thousands of PIRANHA OWLS BURST from the

          grasses around the Croods and form a huge undulating

          cloud above them. It's a beautiful sight.

          The cloud of Piranha Owls then SETTLE on a massive LAND

          WHALE.

          Moments later, they fly back into the air - the whale is

          SKELETONIZED. It CRUMPLES to the ground.

                          GRUG

           Kill circle!

          The Croods form their defensive circle, brandishing

          rocks.

          Eep spies a SKULL lying in the sand. She SPRINTS for it.

          32.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Eep! Eeeep!

          Eep breaks a horn from the skull and BLOWS on it loud and

          long.

          ON GUY hearing the horn. He is happy to hear the sound,

          knowing it's Eep calling him.

          Then as Guy begins walking towards the sound, Guy notices

          the circling birds in the sky. Alarmed, he DASHES off.

          Guy appears at the treeline. He spots Eep standing alone

          in the clearing. He sees the birds heading towards her.

          He runs and leaps off a ROCK OUTCROPPING jumping right

          over the CROODS who are huddled near the ROCK.

          Guy lands and in one fluid motion knocking the horn out

          of Eep's hand to stop the noise then STRIKES a spark with

          two STONES. The birds close in, blotting out the

          remaining light. All goes BLACK.

          Then, a tiny leaf of flame FLUTTERS to life before Guy.

          He THROWS two more handfuls of grass on it, and it FLARES

          UP! The light SPLITS the onrushing red tide of birds

          like a knife. For a few moments the Croods are inside a

          TORNADO of the tiny monsters. The mass PASSES.

          Grug SLAPS at one last smoldering bird FLUTTERING past.

          Grug TURNS to see Guy, HOLDING his daughter. Grug's

          expression DARKENS. He SNARLS.

                          GUY

           Ta-da.

                          EEP

           (Sigh.)

          Grug pushes Eep aside and shows Guy his threat display.

                          GRUG

           Auughhauhhhgggh!

           SMASH CUT TO:

          SEQ. 1275 - FIRE GOOD, FIRE BAD

          Suddenly, Guy and Eep are circled by the Croods. They

          are in defensive ape-like positions. Each doing their

          threat display.

          33.

                          CROODS

           Raaarr,

           grOooOOOOowwllll,

                          ERF ERF

           GLaaabbbllllellelller!

          Guy stands in front of Eep defensively.

                          GUY

           Cavies!

                          EEP

           Cavies?

                          GUY

           Cavemen! Stand back! They're

           practically animals. See their bony,

           sloping foreheads?

                          EEP

           Oh... yeah!

                          GUY

           The huge primitive teeth?

                          EEP

           Er... yeah...

                          GUY

           The excessive body hair? Oh, that one's

           got a tail...

                          EEP

           Uhhh... yeah...

          Guy PULLS his knife.

                          GUY

           Close your eyes. I'm going to have to

           take their lives.

                          EEP

           (slapping the knife away)

           No. It won't help.

                          (EMBARRASSED)

           They're my family.

                          GUY

           What?

          Eep nods toward Thunk.

                          THUNK

           Ah, the sun is in his hands!

          34.

          The Croods keep circling.

                          EEP

           No. No. It's "fire."

                          UGGA

           Where did it come from?

                          EEP

                          (PROUDLY)

           He made it.

          Grug grabs him and squeezes him tight.

                          GRUG

           Make some for me!

                          EEP

           It doesn't come out of him.

                          GRUG

           Make. Make it.

          POP! Guy's ribs are cracked for the second time.

                          GUY

           You know, you're a lot like your

           daughter.

          Guy falls in a heap.

                          EEP

           Great, now he's broken.

           UGGA (O.S.)

           Oh, it's a baby sun.

          Grug turns to see Ugga, Thunk, Gran and Sandy are now

          sitting very close around the fire, transfixed.

                          GRUG

           Whoa! Stay back. We don't know what it

           wants.

          As Grug moves around the circle, picking up sitting

          Croods and placing them a safe distance from the fire, he

          talks to them like a kindergarten teacher:

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Now we'll all sit here, and wait for the

           sun to come back. And tomorrow we'll

           find a new cave, and pretend today never

           happened.

                          (MORE)

          35.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           (looks at the fire)

           Isn't this fun, Eep?

          Grug looks around to see that Eep is kneeling beside Guy.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Eep, don't touch him. Goodness knows

           where he's been.

          Suddenly, behind Grug, Sandy ATTACKS the torch. She

          shakes it with her teeth, EMBERS FLY EVERYWHERE.

                          THUNK

           Dad, Sandy's hurting fire.

          Grug reaches down and scoops up Sandy. (NOTE: From this

          point, Grug will hold onto Sandy, no matter how much she

          struggles, kicks and bites.)

                          GRUG

           Sandy! No! Fire is not a play thing!

                          UGGA

           Aww, what a cute little guy.

                          GRUG

           Hey, stay back.

          The Croods snatch at the embers as they dance in the air

          around them.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           No, no, no, wait!

          One of the embers has caught onto Thunk's tunic.

                          THUNK

           It likes me!

           (after a beat)

           Hey! IT'S BITING ME!!

          Thunk takes off running like a maniac.

          The flame explodes into embers, which starts more fires

          in the grass around him. Grug looks at the growing fires

          with utter confusion.

                          THUNK (CONT'D)

                          (SCREAMING)

           Ow! You're not my friend. Stop, stop

           touching me!

          36.

                          GRUG

           Thunk! Uh, try hiding from it in the

           tall dry grass!

          Thunk sprints through the grass, arms flailing, as a ring

          of fire blazes up.

                          THUNK

           (pleading with fire)

           Stop please, please. I'm only nine.

          Gran cackles at her grandson's misfortune, but then she

          realizes her WALKING STICK IS ON FIRE.

          Angrily, Gran starts to slam the burning end of the stick

          on the ground, trying to put it out.

          But she only ends up making more small fires.

                          UGGA

           Ooh, more fire babies.

          While Gran tries desperately to save her cane, Ugga

          starts throwing sticks on the small fires, which begin to

          grow in size.

                          CUT TO:

          EEP AND GUY.

                          EEP

           Hi.

                          GUY

           So, your Dad, he's trying to kill me.

                          EEP

           Yeah. But I won't let him.

                          CUT TO:

          Eep and Guy witness the FIERY MAYHEM:

           GRUG (O.S.)

           Hold on son, come back!

          SERIES OF SHOTS:

           GRUG is chasing THUNK in circles, throwing rocks at his

          flaming butt.

                          THUNK

           I don't like you anymore!

          37.

           Sandy, who is still in Grug's arms, but facing

          backwards, is now holding onto a burning stick and

          lighting everything she passes on fire.

                          SANDY

           Weeeee!!!!

           Gran, who is still trying to put out her stick, is

          batting it into every tree and bush she can hit.

                          GRAN

           Get out! Out!

           Ugga carries a REDWOOD above her head and then tosses

          it onto the small fire.

                          UGGA

           Eat up, babies!

          WHOOSH! Ugga ignites a massive bonfire.

          The Croods appear like a bunch of violent, lunatic

          pyromaniacs.

          CLOSE ON GRAN

          Gran is pounding her walking stick on the ground.

          PULL BACK TO REVEAL - she is standing on the edge of a

          giant corn field that is slowly catching on fire.

                          GRAN

           Die! Die!

          POOF! The fire on her cane has finally gone out.

                          GRAN (CONT'D)

           I win!

          She smiles. And then WA-POP!

          The giant ear of corn explodes blasting Gran off frame

          who slams into Thunk. The speeding ear picks up Ugga,

          Grug.

          ON EEP AND GUY

                          EEP

           They're not so scary once you get to know

           them.

          Eep and Guy are HIT by the speeding corn.

          38.

                          GUY

           Who are you people?

                          UGGA

           Oh, I'm sorry. We're the Croooooods!

           And you are?

                          GUY

           Uh, Guy.

                          CROODS

                          (WAVING)

           Hi, Guy.

          The speeding ear CRASHES into a lone tree, sending Guy

          and the Croods sprawling across the tundra. The flying

          ears ROCKET SKYWARD and BURST like colorful fireworks.

                          THUNK

           Wow! Looks like magic. And smells like

           food.

          Popcorn kernels RAIN DOWN upon the Croods. They are

          BURIED.

                          GRUG

           Don't eat it, it's new.

          The Croods burst out of a mountain of popcorn.

          ON THE BASE OF THE POPCORN PILE

          Guy BURROWS out the side of the popcorn pile like a

          prisoner escaping Alcatraz.

                          GUY

           gasping for air 

           (checks to see if he's been

                          SPOTTED)

          39.

                          EEP

           Hey, where's Guy?

          Guy RUNS for the mountain. Eep POUNCES on Guy like a

          tiger.

                          GUY

           No!

                          EEP

           Going somewhere?

                          GUY

           The mountain? High ground? End of the

           world, remember?

                          EEP

           That already happened. It destroyed our

           cave.

                          GUY

                          (STRUGGLING)

           Noooo. That was just the beginning of the

           end. The end of the end is still coming.

                          GRUG

           (as if to a dog)

           Eep. Drop it.

          Eep SETS him down. Guy BOLTS but discovers Eep hasn't

          let go of his hand. Guy is YANKED backwards like he's

          been tied to a piling.

                          EEP

           We can't let him go! What if we don't

           find a cave before sunset? What if it

           takes a few days? What if the birds come

           back?

          BEAT.

                          GRAN

           We need his fire, dummy!

          WHOOSH! Grug grabs Guy and throws him in a log.

                          GRUG

           Fine. You're staying with us till we

           find a cave.

          Grug hoists Guy in the log onto his shoulder.

          40.

          Grug moves out, AWAY from the mountain. The family falls

          in behind Grug. Thunk is carrying a huge piece of

          popcorn that he's snacking on.

                          GUY

           What? No I'm not. Don't make me part of

           this. Stay here if you want, but let me

           go. I've got a dream, a mission, a

           reason to live.

                          EEP

                          (BRIGHTLY)

           Not anymore.

                          GUY

                          (THINKING FAST)

           Umm... I've got an idea. Let's go to

           that mountain.

          ON THE TALL MOUNTAIN way in the distance.

                          GRUG

                          (BARELY LOOKS)

           It's too far.

                          EEP

           Dad really has his heart set on a cave.

                          GUY

           Uh, there, are, caves on that mountain.

                          EEP

           Have you been there?

                          GUY

           It's a mountain. Mountains are safe.

           Mountains have caves. And water. And

           sticks.

                          THUNK

           Mom? Did you hear that? I can get my

           own stick!

                          GUY

           Yes. Sticks. Caves and sticks. Crazy

           sticks. Let's go.

          On cue, a RUMBLE. This gets Grug's attention. Grug

          STOPS. The Croods wait to see what's going to happen

          next. A Mammoth FALLS out of sight, SWALLOWED by the

          ground.

                          BELT

           Da da daaaaa.

          41.

          Sandy tries to attack Belt.

                          THUNK

           Ugh. That thing is weird.

          Belt antagonizes Sandy by sticking his tongue out at her.

          Sandy goes at Belt again.

                          EEP

           No no, it's okay Sandy. That's just a

           belt.

           Grug takes a step back. Turns.

                          GRUG

           I've made a decision. We're going to,

           that mountain! Don't ask me why. It's

           just a hunch. It just feels right.

                          UGGA

           I don't know Grug. We've never really

           walked that far.

                          THUNK

           I don't think my feet can do that.

                          GRAN

           I'll never live long enough to get there.

                          GRUG

                          (LIGHTING UP)

           Let's do it.

                          (PAUSE)

           Oh come on, just think. Our whole

           family, packed together on a long, slow

           trip across country? Days and nights

           with just each other. We'll tell

           stories. We'll laugh.

           (glancing at Eep)

           We'll become closer as a family.

          Eep RAISES one eyebrow.

          EXT. BURNT OUT SHRUBS

          The Croods have not traveled far. The camera starts

          tight in on Thunk and Sandy. Sandy is harassing Thunk.

                          THUNK

           Aaaaaaaaugh. Get her off. Get off.

          42.

           If you're not ready to challenge her,

           then don't look her in the eye.

          We follow Sandy as she moves past Gran.

                          GRAN

           Could you keep your big giant arms on

           your side of the trail!

          Sandy moves past Ugga, Eep and Guy who is still stuck in

          the log and being carried by Grug.

                          UGGA

           No more touching. No more touching.

                          EEP

           Isn't this fun? We're taking our first

           trip together.

          Thunk accidentally bumps into Eep.

                          EEP (CONT'D)

           Stop shoving, or I will pull out your

           tongue!

                          GRUG

           Do you want me to turn this family

           around? Do you?! Because I will turn

           this family around so fast!

          The camera slowly pulls out from the family in chaos as

          they walk across the burned out landscape.

          The Croods are traveling across the dry land. The camera

          has pulled out from the family as they travel. Family

          chaos continues.

           Dad, I gotta go!

                          GRUG

           Come on, you can hold it.

                          THUNK

          Thunk starts to HOP WITH HIS KNEES GLUED TO EACH OTHER.

                          GRUG

                          (RELINQUISHING)

           Go behind one of those lumpy things and

           make it fast.

           I don't blame it.

          Oh yeah, more traveling. Now we are in the Turkeyfish

          hunting grounds. The camera is so far away the Croods

          are only a speck in the frame.

          Grug, exhausted, in the foreground with family chaos over

          his shoulder.

           Grug, we're all pretty tired.

                          THUNK

           I'm pretty dizzy, so I'm just going to

           lay down for a minute.

                          GRUG

           We'll eat when we get there.

                          GRAN

           It's taking too long! I'm grabbing a

           snack.

          Gran jumps up and tries to grab Belt. Belt pulls a bone

          knife and defends himself.

                          GUY

           No. No. No. Don't do that. He will cut

           you. That's not food, he's a pet. My

           pet.

                          GRAN

           What's a pet?

                          GUY

           An animal that you don't eat.

                          GRAN

           We call those children.

                          GRUG

           No man should have a pet. It's weird,

           and wrong. It's--

          Thunk CRASHES THROUGH the bushes, PURSUED by the Turkey

          The Turkeyfish squashes Grug into the ground. Then

          continues chasing Thunk.

                          THUNK

           (to Turkey Fish)

           You've got a ton of eggs. Just make

           another egg!

          Thunk FLIES INTO FRAME and SPLATS against the rock. The

          Turkey Fish climbs to the top of a nearby rock and dives

          off.

           There! Who's hungry for scorpion?

          The Croods PULL at the legs. They TWIST and SNAP OFF

          like lobster legs.

           You know, we lost him. But when the bird

           stepped on me and pushed me into the

           ground, the scorpion grabbed a hold of me

           and one thing led to another and here we

           are eating him. Win win.

          The dismembered legs continue to STRUGGLE. Guy looks

           You have bug for dinner. Plenty of bug!

                          GUY

           Please... I'll let you help me hunt.

                          EEP

           Really?

                          THUNK

           Ahhh! They're all over me... Tell my

           story...

          EXT. GRASSLANDS - AFTERNOON

          Guy lays a snare in the low grass. He WALKS to the base

          of a rotund, spikey tree, unwinding more rope as he goes.

          He TIES the rope around the base of the tree. Then he

          hands the loose end to Eep. Belt stretches his arms

          WIDE. Guy STOPS jumping and points up to the top of the

          tree.

          Eep takes the cue. She LEAPS up and grabs the leaning

          top of the tree. Her weight gently BENDS the tree top

          down to the ground.

                          GUY

           Okay.

          Guy carefully SETS the trigger.

                          EEP

           What do you call this?

                          GUY

           A trap.

                          EEP

           What does it do?

          Guy makes sound effects to get his point across as he

          describes the trap.

          49.

                          GUY

           (explains with sounds)

           soft whistle Raargh, Thump thump thump,

           thubububububub soft whistle poom!

           Tadaaaaaa!

                          EEP

           How long have you been alone?

          Belt opens his arms wide showing Guy has been alone a

          long, long time.

                          EEP (CONT'D)

           ... So what do we do?

          Guy pulls out a weird miniature TURKEY FISH PUPPET.

                          GUY

           How's your acting?

          ON THE TURKEY FISH getting ready to eat the TRIP-GERBILS.

          The Turkey LIFTS the creature to his mouth to DEVOUR it,

          but he's INTERRUPTED by a WHISTLING sound. He TURNS to

          see the silly little puppet dancing about. The Turkey

          Fish DROPS his meal and cautiously APPROACHES the puppet.

          ON GUY AND EEP working the puppet. Eep is having the

          time of her life.

                          GUY (CONT'D)

           Oh, you're good at this.

          They are so into what they are doing, they accidentally

          get TANGLED UP.

                          GUY (CONT'D)

           Oh, sorry, I...

                          EEP

           Just move your arm... no, your other arm.

           Oh, that one's mine.

          In their struggle to UNTANGLE themselves, Eep and Guy

          inadvertently insult the Turkey Fish. It CHARGES. Eep

          and Guy don't notice.

          The Turkey Fish MISSES the snare, LEAPS the rock and

          SNATCHES the fake bird off of Guy's head, THRASHING it.

                          EEP (CONT'D)

           Uh... It didn't step in your trap-y,

           thing.

          50.

                          GUY

           Yeah, I noticed.

          Eep BOLDLY STANDS in front of the bird. The Turkey Fish

          grabs Guy and tosses him high across the open field. He

          goes flying through the air, screaming.

          ON GRUG - hearing the commotion. Guy lands back in the

          log.

                          GRUG

           Where's Eep?

          Eep is in full parkour as she runs from the Turkeyfish.

                          GUY

           She's awesome.

          Grug STEPS FORWARD. He's going to SPRING the trap.

                          GRUG

           Eep!

                          EEP

           Dad, no!

          She LEAPS the snare, PUSHING Grug DOWN.

          The Turkey Fish HITS the trigger. The snare TRIPS. The

          bird BITES at the cavemen, but comes up short. The

          Turkey Fish WHOOSHES BACKWARDS into the air. He FLIES a

          couple hundred feet up...

          ... and CRASHES down in a cloud of feathers.

                          DISSOLVE TO:

          SEQ. 900 - BBQ/CAPTIVATING CAPTIVE

          EXT. BARBECUE

          ON THE TURKEY ROASTING over an open fire. It looks golden

          and juicy. Grug is agitated. The Croods are devouring

          the Turkey Fish.

                          THUNK

           It's an avalanche of flavor.

          THE CROODS are eating like wild animals. They

          practically MAUL each other for scraps. HOWLS and

          SNARLING fill the night air. Guy is amazed and shocked

          at how the Croods are wolfing it down.

          51.

          Guy sits to the side, his ankle roped to a heavy rock.

          Guy and Belt share a concerned LOOK as they politely eat

          their meal. Eep comes over and sits next to Guy.

                          GUY

                          (TO BELT)

           Looks like we won't be having any

           leftovers.

                          EEP

           What are "left-overs?"

                          GUY

                          (CONFUSED)

           You know, when you have so much food to

           eat you have some, left over.

                          EEP

           We never have that much food.

          Grug is struck by Eep's words. Ugga sees Grug is hurt.

          Guy and Belt are struck by this as well.

                          UGGA

           Grug, how about a story?

                          GRUG

           That's a good idea. How about a story

           huh?

                          THUNK

           Yeah a story, tell us a story!

          Croods gather around Grug.

                          GRUG

           Once upon a time there was a little tiger

           who lived in a cave with her family.

           There were a lot of rules, but the big,

           simple one was to never leave the cave at

           night. And the door was so heavy, you'd

           think it would be easy to remember.

                          THUNK

           So easy to remember!

                          GRUG

           I know! But, while everyone was asleep,

           she went out anyway.

                          CROODS

           No!

          52.

                          GRUG

           Yes! And no sooner than she did, her

           cave was destroyed and everyone had to go

           on this long, sucky walk, with some

           weirdo they met, and died! The end.

                          GUY

           Whoa! I did not see that coming. Twist

           ending. My stories never end like that.

                          THUNK

           Yes! Two stories in one night!

          The Croods LEAVE Grug and GATHER around Guy. Guy is

          uncharacteristically dumbstruck.

          A BEAT -

                          GUY

           Okay. But it won't be as good as Grug's.

           Um, once upon a time, there was a

           beautiful tiger. She lived in a cave

           with the rest of her family. Her father

           and mother told her, "You may go anywhere

           you want but never go near the cliff, for

           you could fall."

                          GRUG

           And die. Good story.

          Thinking the story is over, the Croods begin to get up.

          As Guy begins talking again they settle back down.

                          GUY

           But when no one was looking, she would go

           near the cliff, for the closer she came

           to the edge, the more she could hear, the

           more she could see, the more she could

           feel. Finally, she stood at the very

           edge, and she saw a light. She leaned

           out to touch it, and slipped.

                          GRUG

           And she fell.

                          GUY

           And she flew.

                          CROODS

                          GASP 

                          THUNK

           Where did she fly?

          53.

                          GUY

           Tomorrow.

                          EEP

           Tomorrow?

                          GUY

           A place with more suns in the sky than

           you can count.

                          THUNK

           It would be so bright.

                          GUY

           A place not like today, or yesterday, a

           place where things are better.

                          GRUG

           Tomorrow isn't a place, you can't see it!

                          GUY

           Oh yes, yes it is. I've seen it. That's

           where I'm going.

          Grug studies Guy. Is he crazy? Eep though is entranced.

          Eep and Guy lock eyes. There is something growing between

          them. Grug and Belt see it too. Grug is not thrilled.

                          GRUG

           Well, WE are going to shut our eyes and

           sleep. And when we wake up we're going

           to find the place that has everything we

           want.

                          EEP

           Tomorrow?!

                          GRUG

           A cave.

          Grug stuffs Guy neatly back inside the log. Grug CURLS

          UP by the fire with the LOG TUCKED UNDER HIS ARM far away

          from Eep.

                          DISSOLVE TO:

          ON GRUG'S FACE.

                          GRUG

           snoring, tossing and turning 

          54.

          Morning light kisses Grug's cheeks. He's sound asleep.

          PULL OUT to reveal that Guy's log is now teetering over a

          cliff edge - there was another subduction during the

          night, and half of the Croods' sleeping platform has sunk

          two hundred feet. Grug is still grasping Guy's log,

          which now hangs over the fresh abyss, and the still-

          asleep Guy is now SLIPPING out of one end. In the nick

          of time, Grug SHIFTS position, inadvertently TURNS the

          log, and Guy starts slipping out the OTHER end. Guy

          WAKES UP, looking down.

                          GUY

           AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUGHHHHH.

           SMASH CUT TO:

          SEQ. 1600 - CROODS GET SHOES

          EXT. CORAL FIELDS - MORNING

          The Croods trudge behind Grug as he cautiously makes his

          way to the mountain. Grug SNIFFS, and TESTS the ground -

          he moves like a man in a mine field. Meaning SLOWLY.

                         THE LOG

          Eep walks alongside Guy, who is still being carried by

          Grug in the log.

                          GUY

           That was too close. It almost caught us.

                          GRUG

           I was watching. We were fine.

                          GUY

           We've got to move faster. Do you people

           have any other speed aside from "wander?"

           I'll take a shamble at this point.

                          EEP

           Hey, do you have a minute? How did the

           tiger fly?

                          GUY

           I only share when I'm outside the log.

           I'm funny that way.

                          EEP

                          (WINKING)

           Leave this to me.

          55.

          Eep FALLS BACK behind Thunk, getting him between she and

          her dad.

                          EEP (CONT'D)

           Hey Thunk, you have a spider on your

           face.

          Eep SMASHES Thunk in the face, KNOCKING him into Grug,

          sending Guy and the log FLYING. Grug shoots Eep an

          annoyed look.

                          EEP (CONT'D)

                          (SHRUGGING)

           Oops.

          Grug sees Guy has ROLLED away.

                          GRUG

           He's loose!

          Grug goes to retrieve Guy, and STEPS on something sharp.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Aaaaahhhhhh! Do not step on those weird,

           pointy rocks!

                          THUNK

           You mean these rocks? Ahh owww! Do not

           step on these rocks!

          Thunk steps on the coral - it CRUNCHES under his feet.

                          GRAN

           Step aside, girls!

          Gran steps out, and then SCREAMS.

                          GRUG

           Hello? Nobody's listening! No one is

           listening. You cannot walk on those!

          Guy stands on the coral without flinching.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Arraughrragh come back here now.

                          GRAN

           Well, there goes our chance for survival.

                          THUNK

           And our log!

          Grug must make the choice to go after Guy.

          56.

                          GRUG

           Okay. Arraugh!

          Grug cringes and bellows with every step. Guy still

          locked inside the log, hops away as fast as he can. Grug

          leaps out and grabs the log only to loosen it as Guy

          jumps to a coral patch below.

                          GUY

           Ow, ow, ow.

          Guy now free runs and hides behind a giant shell. He

          looks back at the Croods as they try in vain to cross the

          field and feels pity for Eep.

                          THUNK

           Ow! Jumping doesn't help, I mean, just

           briefly, but it doesn't get better! Ow!

           Do not walk on your hands, the hands do

           not help at all.

          Guy looks back at the stranded Croods. Then he looks

          again to the tall mountain. Belt sees that Guy is having

          a hard time leaving the Croods. He needs to make a

          choice. Belt makes it for him.

                          BELT

           Eeccoomme on!

          Belt walks Guy back to the Croods

           HARD CUT TO:

          GUY STANDS AT THE EDGE OF THE CORAL, ONLY A FEW FEET FROM

          GRUG AND THE CROODS. GUY'S ARMS ARE FILLED WITH

          SUPPLIES.

                          GUY

           I can help you, but we're going to have

           to make a few changes around here. The

           log ride is over. Drop the log.

          Grug grudgingly DROPS the log.

                          GUY (CONT'D)

           Now, kick it away.

          Grug BARELY NUDGES it.

                          GUY (CONT'D)

           Farther.

          Grug KICKS it a quarter-mile.

          57.

                          GUY (CONT'D)

           Really?!

                          GRUG

           Okay, smart, Guy... now what?

          Guy SMILES.

           HARD CUT TO:

          EXT. CORAL FIELDS - LATER

          Everyone is now wearing "shoes" -- some made of leaves,

          sponges and some are actually fish!

          Ugga and Gran wobble on their new shoes.

          Thunk is covering his eyes, too afraid to look down.

          Thunk looks down at his horrifying fish shoes. They

          blink at him.

                          THUNK

           Ahhhh! Good fish.

          Eep is covering her eyes.

                          GUY

           Okay. Now you can look.

          Eep peers down at her new boots.

                          EEP

           Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh! I love

           them! Where are my feet!?

                          GUY

           They're still there!

                          EEP

           Oh, okay.

          Eep slips, and falls into Guy's arms.

                          GUY

           Whoa. You're really

                          (GETTING CRUSHED)

           ... heavy.

                          EEP

           Really? Thank you!

          Grug walks over as the two fall to the ground.

          58.

                          GRUG

           Hey, wait. Whoa. Whoa. WHOA!!

                          GUY

                          (SWEATING)

           Okay! She's up. I'm good. We're

           good...

                          GRAN

           These shoes are great! Where do you get

           these ideas?

                          GUY

           Ah ha.

          On cue, Belt produces a piece of chalk.

          Guy stands Thunk against a wall. Guy stands next to him.

          Belt OUTLINES them. Guy excitedly gestures to the

          silhouettes.

                          GUY (CONT'D)

           I'm calling it, a brain. I'm pretty sure

           it's where ideas come from.

                          THUNK

           Dad. I don't have a brain.

                          GRUG

           We've gotten along just fine without

           brains till now. Cavemen don't need

           brains. We have these. Heeya! Haha!

           (balls his mighty fists)

           That's what I'm talking about! Ideas are

           for weaklings.

          Grug punches at the air in front of Guy making him wince.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Now, let's get to that mountain.

          Ugga and Eep notice each other's shoes.

                          UGGA/EEP

           Oh wow. I love those!

                          THUNK

           Good fish. Don't eat my feet.

                          CUT TO:

          SEQ. 1710 - GOING GUY'S WAY

          59.

          The Croods run, slowly at first, then faster. And

          faster. The shoes make the difference.

          ON THE CROODS

          Grug encounters a bunch of Punch Monkeys again. He

          readies himself for a fight.

          Guy hands out bananas.

          Grug throws his banana to the ground only to slip on it.

          ON THE CROODS

          Grug sees the Macawnivore down below in the crevasse

          waiting for his Croods dinner.

          Grug sees Guy making something out of sticks.

          Traveling by stilts over a crevasse.

          The family hobbles across a canyon on their stilts. Guy

          helps Eep from falling.

                          EEP

           So... How'd the tiger fly?

                          GUY

           He jumped on the sun and rode it to

           tomorrow.

           Grug doesn't like seeing his daughter so close to Guy.

                          GRUG

           No, no, no!

          The family moves across, Grug is the last to follow.

          Grug spies Chunky the Death Cat below him. Grug WHACKS

          Chunky in the face with a stilt.

          Chunky ponders the strange sticks Grug is perched on,

          then WHACKS a chunk out of them. Grug DROPS down by a

          yard or so. Panicking, Grug RACES across the chasm,

          losing stilt height with every SWIPE of Chunky's paw.

          Grug doesn't make it across - SNARLING and BITING sounds

          emanate from the canyon.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Ooowwwww!

          The Croods stand at the top of a cliff.

          60.

          Grug tries to maneuver his way down the cliff by clinging

          to the side.

          Guy and the other Croods sit on a giant leaves, sledding

          down the side of the canyon past Grug.

          They pass Grug up as he continues to make his way down by

          tiptoeing. Grug stumbles and falls down the slope.

                          THUNK

           Hi dad! Bye dad!

                          CUT TO:

          BOOM! A FLASH POPS against the Croods. SWING THE CAMERA

          AROUND to reveal A HUGE STORM hanging like a purple

          curtain before them. The Croods stop dead.

          The rain line BEARS DOWN on them.

          Grug tries to PUNCH the drops.

          ON EEP AND GUY

                          GUY

           You've seen rain before... right?

                          EEP

           We don't get out much.

          Guy opens an Umbrella to cover himself from the rain.

          Belt pulls Eep under the umbrella to be close to Guy.

                          BELT

           Hmmmmm.

          Belt makes an Origami boat. He and Sandy sail across the

          rain puddles.

          Grug seeing Guy and Eep snuggling under the umbrella,

          grabs the umbrella away from Guy. Grug gets hit by

          lightning.

          The rest of the Croods open their umbrellas to take cover

          as they enjoy the RAIN.

          ON THE CROODS UNDULATING REFLECTION

          The Croods stand on a tiny island in a shallow ocean -

          Eep is pointing at her own reflection.

                          GRUG

                          (FRUSTRATED)

           Eep, looks dangerous.

          61.

                          EEP

           Oh dad, you say that about everything.

          Eep goes to jump in the water. Guy STOPS her.

                          GUY

           Careful.

                          EEP

           Oh really? Okay.

          Guy CANNONBALLS. Then SURFACES.

          Eep tentatively HOPS in. Guy STEADIES her. Then shows

          her how to move her arms in a swimming motion.

          Guy SUPPORTS Eep by holding one hand under her tummy.

          She begins to SWIM.

          Gran and Ugga SMILE mischievously - a positive vibe is

          building.

          The Croods ALL JUMP at once.

          Grug is left alone. Belt uses Grug's arm as a diving

          platform. Gran, Sandy and Belt are doing synchronized

          swimming. Then Grug sees Eep and Guy SURFACE - Eep is on

          Guy's shoulders! This is too much for Grug!

                          GRUG

           Augh! No no no! Not cool. Not cool.

           Not cool.

          Grug DIVES IN to put a stop to any potential shenanigans.

          Grug's huge tidal wave SWAMPS Guy and Eep. Grug SINKS to

          the bottom.

          ON GRUG laying on the bottom. His family SWIMS above him

          on the tails of Fishcats, confident and free and buoyant.

          A lone bubble escapes Grug's nose, like oil oozing from a

          sunken wreck. He's feeling mighty extraneous.

          Grug sees the Macawnivore swimming towards him. Grug

          swims for his life. Ends in a big splash.

                          DISSOLVE TO:

           So the bear says, "Your cave?" I've been

           dumping my bones here since last week.

                          GRAN

           Last week, haha. That's a funny story!

                          GUY

           It's not a story! It's a joke.

                          GRAN

           What's a joke?

                          GUY

           You know, just making something up... to

           make you laugh.

                          GRAN

           Hah, I don't get it.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. TUFA MAZE - AFTERNOON

          The Croods stand motionless before an open plain, deeply

          sculpted with meandering grooves which form a massive

          MAZE.

          Guy is handing out SHELLS to the Croods.

                          GUY

           Here you go, one for you, and this ones

           for you.

                          THUNK

           Thanks.

          Grug is annoyed by everyone blowing their shells.

                          GRUG

           Okay. Okay. That's enough. I don't see

           why the kids need their own shells.

                          GUY

           So if anyone gets in trouble, we can call

           the others.

                          GRUG

           Wait-- you're saying we should split up?

                          GUY

           We can try more paths at once. It's the

           fastest way through.

          63.

                          GRUG

           Croods stick together.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Your way isn't safe.

                          GUY

           They can handle it.

                          EEP

           We can do it, dad.

                          GRUG

           No no no no no. It's my job to keep you

           safe. I'm still in charge and we are not

           splitting up.

           (seeing Eep and Guy together)

           Except for you two. And that's final.

          Grug SITS down like a silverback gorilla.

          Just then, A HUGE RUMBLE. The EARTH STARTS TO SHAKE

          VIOLENTLY. The Croods and Guy are KNOCKED DOWN into the

          Maze each `falling' into a separate entrance.

          They disappear into the rift like a penny dropped down a

          drain.

          As Grug and Guy slide passed each other. Frustrated Grug,

          tries to punch Guy.

                          GUY

           Oh, hello.

          INSIDE THE MAZE

          The SHAKING COMES TO A STOP. Everyone (now separated)

          gathers themselves.

          ON GRUG-- finding himself alone.

                          GRUG

                          (VERY FRIGHTENED)

           Hello? Is everyone alright?

                          UGGA

           (trying to calm him)

           We're okay, Grug.

                          THUNK

           Dad? I'm freaking out a little bit.

           Just tell me what to do. Just what do I

           do right now?

          64.

                          GRUG

           Stay where you are. I'll find you.

                          GUY

           No. Too slow. Everybody, keep moving

           forward and we'll get out.

                          THUNK

           Dad?

                          GRUG

                          (ALMOST HYPERVENTILATING)

           Yeah. Okay.

                         ON THUNK

          Looking very frightened.

           GRUG (O.S.) (CONT'D)

           Remember never not be afraid.

           GUY (O.S.)

           You can do this.

                          THUNK

           It's gonna be okay. I'm gonna pass out.

          Thunk PICKS UP his shell, and tentatively makes his way,

          alone, into his branch of the maze.

          ON EEP (OR GUY?)-- in another part of the maze. She puts

          her hand on the giant wall to her LEFT.

          PULL BACK and see that they are actually in parallel

          `channels' but with the huge wall between them.

          ON Gran and Ugga - encountering carnivorous flowers.

          ON Thunk - encountering a croco-pup.

          ON Eep - finding a flower dropped on her path.

          ON Grug - reaching a fork.

          Ugga and Gran don flowery camouflage.

          Thunk THROWS his shell at the Crocopup, MISSES. To his

          surprise the Crocopup returns the shell.

          Thunk plays fetch with this portly beast, which shows him

          the way through the maze.

          65.

          Eep PICKS UP the flower, puts it in her hair, then finds

          a more flowers dropped on her path. She playfully begins

          hunting for Guy.

          Guy and Belt are secretly and playfully tossing flowers

          in Eep's path.

          Grug POPS out of a passageway - he's back where he began.

          He chooses another tunnel.

          Ugga and Gran pass unharmed through the flower grove -

          the colors and smells are overpoweringly vibrant.

          Eep surprises Guy and Belt in their hideaway as the two

          of them continue to throw flowers over the edge and onto

          Eep's path.

                          EEP

           You dropped these.

          Guy slips and falls onto a huge lilypad. He smiles up at

          Eep.

          They share a moment before Eep shyly vanishes again.

          Grug finds himself back at the entrance of the maze. He

          grumbles and enters a different tunnel.

          ON THE MAZE EXIT -

          Guy appears at the exit and puts his hand up to the

          setting sun that kisses the top of the mountain. Guy is

          amazed that he and Eep are both doing the same thing. He

          is smitten. Guy goes over to Eep.

          Guy takes her hand.

                          GUY

           Come with me.

          Eep and Guy turn to each other, just as Thunk emerges and

          tosses a rock for the Croco-Pup to fetch.

                          THUNK

           Here boy, catch!

          A shell note signals Ugga, Gran and Sandy's arrival.

          There is an obvious change in the ladies.

                          THUNK (CONT'D)

           Gran?

          Ugga removes her hat to reveal her new look.

          66.

                          EEP

           Mom?

                          BELT

                          (APPROVING)

           Raaah raaah.

          A loud shell blast interrupts. It is followed by two

          others.

                          UGGA

           Grug?

          Grug lets out another blow on his horn.

                          UGGA (CONT'D)

           I'll go get him.

          ON GRUG still stuck in the maze. He holds his head in

          defeat, and TOSSES the shell down.

          TRUCK-IN on Grug.

           I was in love once. He was a hunter, I

                          UGGA

           Grug, they're okay. Guy's with them.

                          GRUG

           Oh, oh, `Guy'. `Guy' is with them. Well

           thank you for bringing me that

           interesting Guy update!

          A BEAT - Ugga regards her husband

                          UGGA

           Oh, okay. I'm gonna go up and why don't

           you join us when you stop being a big

           drag!

          Ugga climbs up the tree to be with the rest of the

          family.

          Grug isn't thrilled with Ugga's shot at him. He picks up

          two rocks and tries to make fire.

                          GRUG

           Sleep pile? How about a story, huh?

           Anyone?

          Grug listens intently. All he hears is laughter.

                         TREE TOP

          Thunk, Sandy Belt and Gran are sitting around a torch,

          listening to one of Gran's stories.

                          GRAN

           And then Torg said "Know it? I drew it!"

          68.

           THUNK GRAN SANDY BELT

           Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

                          THUNK

           That makes no sense.

          Ugga arrives and sits next to Guy. She takes in the

          scene.

                          UGGA

                          (TO GUY)

           I know it was hard for you to bring us

           along, but they had the best day of their

           lives... Thank you for that.

          A RUMBLE distracts Guy. He looks to the horizon. FIRES

          and SMOKE on the horizon mark the leading edge of the

          collapse. Eep comes to his side.

                          GUY

           I want to show you something.

          Guy LIGHTS A TORCH and leads the Croods up, up, to the

          forest canopy.

          Guy BLOWS OUT his torch. The night sky is revealed in

          all its glory. The Croods are amazed.

          Music POUNDS as the spectacle SWEEPS around the Croods.

          Perched on the canopy of the forest the Croods seem to

          sit at the very brink of the universe.

                          THUNK

           More suns in the sky than you can count.

                          GUY

           Every sun that crosses our sky, comes to

           rest up there.

                          EEP

           Tomorrow.

                          GUY

           That's where we'll be safe.

          ON GRUG ARRIVING at the tree top. When he sees the stars

          he DUCKS back down, terrified.

          He overhears the rest of the conversation.

          Eep with tears in her eyes.

                          EEP

           I'm going with Guy.

          69.

          Grug is beside himself with panic, sick at the thought of

          losing Eep.

                          GRUG

                          (WHISPERED)

           No. Not my little girl.

                          EEP

           Come with us.

                          UGGA

           I can't go without Grug.

                          GRAN

           Well, that makes one of us. Count me in!

                          UGGA

           Really Mom? Now?

          Grug continues to listen in.

                          GRAN

           Grug has no idea how to protect us. In

           fact, he has no ideas at all.

                          UGGA

           No, that's not true. What about that one

           time when he a...

                          GRAN

           Face it! If he actually had an idea of

           his own I'd, I'd have a heart attack and

           die!

                         ON GRUG

          Grug smiles to himself.

                          CUT TO:

          SEQ. 1550 - GRUG TRIES TO CHANGE

          EXT. TREE - SUNRISE

                         ON UGGA

                          UGGA

           Grug?

          The whole family is searching for Grug. He has

          disappeared.

          70.

                          THUNK

           Dad?

                          EEP

           Dad?

                          GUY

           He's a big guy. How can he just disappear

           like that?

                          THUNK

           Hey wait. Let's ask that ugly lady if

           she's seen dad.

                          UGA

           Yeah.

          Grug SPINS AROUND. He's wearing a rasta-style wig made

          from knotted grass. The sight SHOCKS Ugga.

                          GRUG

           Haven't seen him.

                          UGGA

           Augh!

          ON GRUG with the family standing around him.

                          UGGA(CONT'D)

                          (CONCERNED)

           What are you doing?

                          GRUG

           (Playing to Eep)

           Yeah, Wow. Like, I was up all night cuz

           like all these, ideas just kept coming to

           me.

          Grug LIFTS his tunic, a Boa Constrictor is wrapped around

          his waist.

                          GUY

           Is that a snake?

                          GRUG

           Belt! New and improved! It's even self-

           tightening. Ow!

          The constrictor SQUEEZES Grug till he turns blue. Grug

          SMACKS it and it relaxes a little.

                          UGGA

           What is that on your head?

          71.

                          GRAN

           It's called desperation.

          Grug strokes his weird, fake rasta-hair.

                          GRUG

           (swings his long hair around)

           I call it a "rug." Rhymes with Grug.

           And this one. I call it a "ride."

           Rhymes with Grug.

          Grug regards a boulder as if it's a Ferrari.

                          GUY

           That, doesn't--

                          GRUG

           It's gonna get us places faster than

           shoes.

          Grug climbs on top of the rock, facing the wrong way.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Yeah. Try to keep up.

          He LEANS FORWARD. The "car" ROLLS downhill and SMASHES

          through a redwood, TOPPLING it.

                          THUNK

           I wish I had a ride.

                         ON THUNK

          His face SLATHERED with reddish mud.

                          GRUG

           Painting is a thing of the past. I call

           this, a "snap-shot."

          Grug takes a huge flat stone and SMASHES it against

          Thunk, forcibly transferring the mud image to the rock.

          Grug shows the Croods.

                          THUNK

           Let's do it again. I think I blinked.

          Thunk PASSES OUT.

          ON THE CROODS

          Wearing wooden sunglasses. They are effectively wearing

          blindfolds.

          72.

                          GRUG

           I call them "shades."

                          THUNK

           The sun doesn't hurt my eyes anymore!

           Where do you get these great ideas?

                          GRUG

           Since I don't have a brain, they're

           coming from my stomach. Down deep below,

           and then up again into my mind.

          Thunk walks into a tree. All the other Croods RAISE their

          "shades" in time to see Grug walk over a cliff.

                          GUY

           Grug. We have to keep moving.

                         ON GRUG

                          GRUG

           See, I got ideas, I got thoughts.

          ON Grug lifting a huge flat rock over his head.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Like this. I call it a "mobile home."

           Isn't that something?

          A huge BEAST BUNNY JUMPS into the opening of the rock.

          Grug is smashed flat.

                         ON GRUG

          Standing on one side of a primitive Teeter-Totter.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           And I'm calling this one a "lifterator."

                          EEP

           Mom?

                          UGGA

           I know. It's bad.

          Grug tosses a massive boulder on the opposite end. Grug

          is LAUNCHED into the sky. Grug becomes a speck in the

          sky. He is HIT by LIGHTNING.

                          GRAN

           I almost feel sorry for him.

          73.

          Grug falls back down onto the teeter totter dislodging

          the boulder from the other side. The boulder rolls back

          down onto Grug.

                          GRAN (CONT'D)

           Hah, no I don't.

                          DISSOLVE TO:

          SEQ. 1950 - TRUTH REVEALED

          Guy is rowing a SHELL BOAT with everyone inside.

                          UGGA

           What are you trying to do Grug?

                         ON GRUG

          Burned and battered, laying in the bottom of a turtle

          shell boat.

          Ugga is attending to his injuries.

                          GRUG

           I thought if I could have ideas like Guy,

           maybe Eep would listen to me. Maybe she

           wouldn't want to go with Guy.

          Ugga gets a PAINED look on her face.

                          UGGA

           Oh Grug, is that what this is all about?

          Ugga is about to confess her thoughts of going to

          Tomorrow with Guy when Grug interrupts her.

                          GRUG

           And I also thought it would kill your

           mother. So you know? Win win.

                          GUY

           We're here.

          The view of the mountain is beautiful.

          Thousands of birds fly overhead darkening the sky.

          The shell boat hits the shore. The Croods step out onto

          land.

          An explosion goes off on a nearby mountain. A PLUME of

          magma BURSTS from the water in the distance.

          Grug looks around for shelter and spots a cave.

          74.

                          GRUG

           Cave! Everyone inside. Come on! Hurry

           up, let's go. Go, go.

          The Croods don't want to move.

                          EEP

           No.

                          UGGA

                          (GENTLY)

           No more caves, Grug.

                          GRUG

           What?

                          GRAN

           We're gonna jump on the sun and ride it

           to Tomorrow with Guy.

                          GRUG

           Wait, so you're all going to do this?

          Silence from the Croods answers his question.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Thunk?

                          THUNK

           Sorry, dad.

          Thunk joins the others. It's the last straw.

                          EEP

           You have to stop worrying for all of us.

                          GRUG

           It's my job to worry. It's my job to

           follow the rules.

                          EEP

           The rules don't work out here.

                          GRUG

           They kept us alive.

                          EEP

           That wasn't living, that was just, not

           dying. There's a difference.

                          GRUG

           Ugga, everyone, you have to listen to me.

          Ugga doesn't move.

          75.

                          EEP

           We would be dead if we listened you.

          Grug is STUNNED.

                          EEP (CONT'D)

           We have to follow Guy now.

          Grug slowly turns around to face Guy. He is smoldering.

                          GRUG

           Guy?

                          UGGA

           Guy, run.

          Grug lunges toward Guy, SCREAMING.

                          GRUG

           AAAAAAAAAAUGHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!

          Grug ATTACKS Guy - they fall down an embankment.

                          CUT TO:

          SEQ. 2100 - TAR PIT

          Grug CHASES Guy across a TREMBLING landscape.

                          GUY

           This is pointless. We're running out of

           time. Everything is collapsing. You're

           being irrational and counterproductive.

                          GRUG

           Big words anger me. Keep talking.

                          GUY

           Countermeasures.

          Belt THROWS fruit at Grug. The fruit HITS Grug square in

          the face. He's blinded. He doesn't stop.

                          GUY (CONT'D)

           Remember how you were this morning? You

           changed, remember? Idea man? Modern

           man?

          Guy comes to a sudden stop - he's stepped in a small

          puddle of TAR.

          Grug wipes his eyes clean of fruit.

          76.

                          GRUG

           I... am... a... CAVEMAN.

                          GUY

           No, no, no wait.

          Guy and Grug do a slow-motion PLUNGE over a tar-fall. As

          they descend Grug SWINGS at Guy, coating himself with

          tar. Grug's arms are held like glue. His punches stop

          well short of Guy's face. Guy and Grug arrive in a wide

          pool of tar. They SINK slowly.

                          GRUG

           Hnnnnnngh! No. What is this stuff that

           saves you from my punches?

                          GUY

                          (HOLLOW)

           Tar.

          The tone of Guy's voice SINKS IN. Grug CEASES his

          attack.

                          GUY (CONT'D)

           Please Grug. You have to stop struggling.

                          GRUG

           No. I have to get back to them.

                          GUY

           Grug! Stop!

          Grug looks to Guy.

                          GUY (CONT'D)

           No one gets out of this. Believe me. I

           know.

          Grug gets it.

                          GRUG

           Your...?

                          GUY

           Family. Yeah.

                          GRUG

           Sorry.

          Grug looks at Guy again - he needs more than that. Guy

          takes a deep breath - this is going to be hard.

          77.

                          GUY

           I was little when it happened. The last

           thing my parents told me was, "Don't

           hide. Live. Follow the Sun. You'll

           make it to Tomorrow."

          This resonates with Grug.

          A thread of light trickles through the storm, falling

          just near enough to Guy he can gather it in his palm.

                          GRUG

           You followed the light. My daughter is a

           lot like you.

                          GUY

           No. She's like you. She loves you but

           always forgets to say it. Just like you

           forget to tell her.

          Grug ponders this. A CHANGE comes over Grug. He focuses

          on Guy. This hits Grug hard.

                          GRUG

                          (CRUSHED)

           I guess I was just busy keeping them all

           alive.

          Guy considers Grug.

                          GUY

           It's okay. That's what Dads do.

          Grug smiles. He regards Guy in a different light. He

          sees him not as a boy but a man. Someone good enough for

          his little girl.

                          GRUG

           That's right... but we can't do that from

           here. We need one of your ideas.

          The music TURNS.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Come on. You can do it.

          Buoyed by Grug's encouragement, Guy swings into action

          mode.

                          GUY

           Belt! Emergency Idea Generator,

           activate!

          Belt hits Guy in the head with a rock.

          78.

                          GUY (CONT'D)

           Ow!

                          (THEN)

           I've got it!

                          CUT TO:

          SEQ. 2250 - GRUG & GUY ESCAPE

          We are tracking with the MACAWNIVORE. Suddenly, the big

          cat stops. His eyebrows raise.

          MACAWNIVORE'S POV - a FEMALE MACAWNIVORE PUPPET.

                          BELT

                          TA-DAAAAA

                          GRUG

           Wow.

                          GUY

           Yeah, I know. But he's doing the best

           with what he has. Let's go.

          Grug and Guy are holding bones connected to the puppet.

          Belt SIGNALS to Guy.

                          GUY (CONT'D)

           There he is. Belt, I want romance, drama,

           sincerity. Move me.

          Belt makes music, which grabs the Macawnivore's

          attention.

                          GUY (CONT'D)

           Okay he sees us!

          Belt plays a little melodramatic tune.

          Grug halfheartedly moves the bones he's holding.

                          GUY (CONT'D)

           That's our cue. Now work it!

          The puppet starts shaking its tail.

                          GUY (CONT'D)

           He's not coming over. I don't think our

           puppet looks scared enough.

                          GRUG

           Scared? I'll show you scared. Hand me

           those acting sticks!

          79.

          Grug shakes the puppet and makes a frightening sound of

          terror.

          Suddenly, the Macawnivore leaps forward and jumps on the

          puppet. He grabs it and pulls it up out of the tar,

          bringing Grug and Guy along with it.

          Grug and Guy hang on to the bones of the puppet frame.

          The Macawnivore shakes the puppet, pulling it out of the

          tar along with Grug and Guy.

                          GUY

           Hold on!

          The puppet breaks apart, the Macawnivcore turns to Grug

          and Guy. He is not pleased.

                          BELT

           Da da daaaaaa...

          The Macawnivore dashes towards the pair. They try to run

          from him. The Macawnivore's paws slip slowly backwards

          into the nearby tar--he's stuck. The tar snaps him back

          and throws him far from Grug and Guy.

          Belt blows a whistle signalling a field goal!

                          GRUG

           Yes. You did it!

          Grug PATS Guy on the back. Grug realizes his hand is

          stuck to Guy's back.

          The Croods come running to help them.

                          UGGA

           Grug.

                          THUNK

           Dad!

          Grug and Guy TURN to see the rest of the Croods. Grug

          waves to the family with Guy stuck to his hand.

                          GUY

           Hey, we're okay!

          The family stops to take this in.

                          GUY (CONT'D)

           Yeah, we're okay.

          80.

          The ground shakes violently. Meteors stream across the

          sky.

                          GUY (CONT'D)

           Grug. Your call.

          Grug knows his answer.

                          GRUG

           Take us to Tomorrow.

                          CUT TO:

          SEQ. 2925 - TO TOMORROW

          EXT. EDGE OF THE WORLD - EARLY EVENING.

          ON THE CROODS

          RUSHING up the gun-sight into the bright rays of the sun.

                          GUY

           Hurry! Come on. We're gonna make it!

          When the Croods rush toward "Tomorrow," it is a golden,

          ethereal image created by a perfect alignment of sun,

          clouds, and mountain. From the Croods POV it looks as if

          they can cross a solid bridge of clouds and climb onto a

          waiting sun.

                          EEP

           You were right.

                          GUY

           There it is. The sun. We can do it! We

           can ride it to Tomorrow.

          Even Grug is taken with the sight - it's there after all.

          The Croods stare at the open meadow across from them.

          Tremors violently SHAKE the ground.

                          GUY (CONT'D)

           Run!

          When the rift OPENS in front of them, the hot gasses and

          blasts of hot ash BURST the clouds from beneath. The

          debris shades the sun, revealing a very Earthly landscape

          beyond.

          From the Croods perspective, Tomorrow vanished before

          their eyes.

          81.

          A SHOCKWAVE knocks a large chunk of rock off the edge the

          Croods are standing on blowing them backwards.

                          GUY (CONT'D)

           I don't understand. The sun was right

           here. It was right here.

          KABOOM! A gargantuan jet of ash STABS at the sky. Ugga

          PULLS the Croods away from the ledge. She herds them

          back toward the gunsight.

                          UGGA

           We have to go back to the cave. Hurry,

           hurry, stay together. Let's keep moving.

           Move, move! Everybody hold my hand.

           Thunk let's go. Go! Let's stay

           together.

          But Grug doesn't join them. Instead, Grug takes a step

          TOWARD the precipice, peering into the curtain of ash as

          if trying to burn a hole straight through it.

                          UGGA (CONT'D)

           Grug? What's wrong with you? Grug we'll

           die if we stay here!

          Grug spies a wispy shaft of light STRUGGLING through the

          ash cloud. He HOLDS UP his hand to feel it. A beam of

          light settles on his palm. Grug is ENLIGHTENED.

                          UGGA (CONT'D)

           (softly to Grug)

           Grug. Listen to me. We've gotta get

           back to that cave.

          Grug looks back at his family - huddled, terrified. The

          picture of what he would have wanted in the beginning.

          The sight bothers him.

          Grug TURNS to face them.

                          GRUG

           No more dark. No more hiding. No more

           caves.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           To follow the light.

          82.

          A smile breaks across Eep's face - her dad has answered

          the question.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           I can't change. I don't have ideas. But

           I have my strength. And right now that's

           all you need.

                          UGGA

           No. We don't know what's over there.

           Maybe nothing. It's too risky.

                          GRUG

           It's a chance.

          Belt wipes a tear off his face.

                          GUY

           I'll take that chance.

          Grug LIFTS Guy above his head.

                          GRUG

           You know, I've wanted to throw you away

           ever since I met you.

                          GUY

           Heh. That's a joke, right?

                          GRUG

           What's a joke?

          Grug's comment freaks Guy out. ANOTHER ANGLE shows Grug

          with a twinkle in his eye.

          Belt puts on his helmet for safety.

          With a titanic effort, he HURLS Guy in to the void.

          The Croods wait an eternity. Then - a HORN SOUNDS.

                          UGGA

           He made it... He made it...

                          GRUG

           Okay, Thunk. Your turn.

                          THUNK

           You're not coming, are you?

                          GRUG

           When you make it, so will I.

          Grug HURLS Thunk.

          83.

          Ugga KISSES Grug. She whispers in his ear.

                          UGGA

           You did good.

                          SANDY

           Daddy.

          Grug wipes a tear from Ugga's eye. Then lifts her above

          his head. He HURLS her across.

                          GRUG

           Gran.

          Gran is next in line.

                          GRAN

           No mush, just throw me.

          Grug LIFTS her above his head.

                          GRAN (CONT'D)

           Wait. You surprised me today. Lunkhead.

          Grug SMILES and throws her next.

                          GRAN (CONT'D)

           (landing on the other side)

           Still alive!!!

          Another TREMBLER. MORE cliff FALLS away. Now the

          distance is even greater.

          Eep is next in line.

                          GRUG

           Time to go.

                          EEP

           No. I have too much to say to you. I

           need to fix everything and I don't have

           time.

                          GRUG

           I can fix it.

          Grug embraces Eep.

                          EEP

           This works good. What do you call it?

                          GRUG

           I was thinking of calling it a Hug.

           (clears his throat)

                          (MORE)

          84.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Because it rhymes with Grug. But you can

           change it if you want.

                          EEP

           No. I like a "Hug."

          A BEAT.

                          GRUG

           I love you.

          Eep takes in the full effect of her dad's words.

                          EEP

           I...

          The ground begins to shake and break apart around them.

                          EEP (CONT'D)

           Dad, I'm scared.

                          GRUG

           Never be afraid.

          The gap grows wider. Grug lifts Eep and makes the

          greatest throw of his life.

          The tumult parts briefly. Grug can see his entire family

          safe on the other side. He waves a last goodbye. To his

          surprise, a shaft of sunlight has settled on his open

          hand.

                          GUY

           There. I see him!

          The family waves to Grug to let him know they are okay.

          Grug is startled by another earthquake. The ground is

          ripping itself apart as meteors begin to fall around him.

          Grug dodges falling debris and lighting and manages to

          crawl into a nearby cave-- a familiar place for him.

          85.

          INT. CAVE

          Grug grabs two pieces of flint and starts clicking them

          together, just as Guy did earlier. They ignite. Grug

          has created his very first fire.

                          GRUG

                          (PLEASED)

           Hey, I did it.

          Another earthquake shakes the cavern. Grug moves over to

          a wall and uses some nearby mud to paint a portrait of

          his family. He paints each member individually and then

          looks longingly at the family he will never see again.

          The torch begins to go out. Grug blows on it and is

          startled by the massive Macawnivore beast, growling at

          him.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Ahhhh! Back! Stay back! Stay back!

          The Macawnivore blows out the torch. Another meteor hits

          the cave with a loud boom! The Macawnivore stops growling

          and starts blowing on the torch along with Grug. It is

          just as frightened as Grug. Grug reaches out and pets

          the now gentle carnivorous beast.

          INT. CAVE

          Grug and the Macawnivore huddle together in a prehistoric

          armistice. When suddenly, Grug hears the dim tone of

          Eep's "shell signal." He rushes to the entrance to the

          cave. He surveys the raging CATACLYSM outside the cave

          as the world is being torn asunder.

          He hears the SHELL ALARM blow TWO MORE TIMES. His family

          is in trouble.

                          GRUG

           They're in trouble. Hang on! I'm

           coming.

          The scale of his problem sinks in.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           How do I get across? Gotta think. What

           would Guy do? What would Guy do?

          Something occurs to Grug.

          86.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           What would I do?

          He absent-mindedly hands the torch to the Macawnivore.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Hold this.

          Grug CLOSES HIS EYES, and CONCENTRATES.

          The ember of a thought FLICKERS TO LIFE in Grug's brain.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

          to the Macawnivore.

          Grug leaps onto the Macawnivore's back as the birds move

          in closer. The ground begins to break up violently as

          lakes empty themselves and entire forests turn sideways.

          The Macawnivore rushes into a giant rib cage that Grug

          has coated with tar. The Piranha Owls hit the rib cage

          and stick to it. As they fight to free themselves, the

          rib cage lifts off the ground. Grug takes a giant tree

          branch, ignites it, and uses it as a rudder, scaring the

          Piranha Owls and prompting them to fly in one coherent

          direction.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Yes!

          As the cage flies, above the fiery landscape, Grug sees

          Douglas, sitting forlornly with the shell still in his

          mouth.

          87.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Douglas?

          Grug doesn't even debate it, he runs back for the little

          monstrosity.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Hey, I know that guy.

          Grug JUMPS out of the cage and rushes over to grab the

          gerbils. Then Grug notices a familiar Liyote hiding

          under a nearby rock. He GRABS the Liyote. Grug sees the

          TRIP-GERBILS stranded as well. Grug TWIRLS the Trip-

          Gerbils around his neck like a scarf.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Get up!

          A ROAR BUILDS behind Grug - the pyroclastic flow is

          SPEEDING closer.

          Grug CATCHES UP to the lumbering blimp-cage. He PUSHES

          it to go faster.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Hold on.

          The pyroclastic cloud BLASTS up the narrow passage.

          Finally, with Grug's strength, the cage CLEARS the edge

          of the cliff.

          The CLOUD HITS them all, SWALLOWING the Cage like a

          speck.

                          CUT TO:

          SQ 3000 REUNITED - 05.16.2012

          EXT. "TOMORROW"

                         ON EEP

          Standing at the edge of the cliff alone, BLOWING her

          shell horn. Behind her, Sandy HOWLS. Gran puts a

          comforting arm around her grandchildren, even she has a

          tear in her eye.

          The ground begins to shake softly.

                          GUY

           It's not safe here.

          88.

                          GRAN

           I'll tell her.

          Gran walks up to Eep. Eep continues to blow her shell

          horn. Eep and Gran share a moment. Eep breaks into tears.

          Gran looks at her shell horn and BLOWS it loudly. Eep is

          happily surprised.

          The whole family, even Guy, steps up next to Eep and

          begins BLOWING their shell horns.

          It's clear from Eep's expression she has no intention of

          budging.

                          EEP

           I never got to tell him.

          Ugga appeals to Eep.

                          UGGA

           Eep, if your Dad were here, he would tell

                          YOU TO--

           GRUG (O.S.)

           GET OUT OF THE WAY!!!

                          THUNK

           Wow, you sound just like him.

          Ugga looks up. Guy LOOKS UP. Everyone looks up!

           GRUG (O.S.)

           GET OUT OF THE WAY!!!

                          SANDY

           Daddy!

                          EEP

           He did it!

                          GUY

           He's riding the Sun... but not very well.

           Everybody out of the way!

          Grug CRASHES near the family. They run to meet him.

                          THUNK

           Dad!

                          UGGA

           Grug!

          89.

                          GRUG

           Ahhh! Where's the danger? Who blew their

           shell?

          But all Grug sees is his astonished family staring back

          at him.

          Eep RUNS to him, HUGS him ferociously, nearly knocking

          him down.

                          EEP

           I love you too.

          The rest of the Croods begin running to Grug. Grug hugs

          each of them like never before.

                          GRUG

           One, two, three, four, five, six...

          Grug puts his arm around Guy.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           ... and seven.

          Belt wants to be acknowledged as well.

                          BELT

           Eerrghh.

                          GRUG

           And a half.

          All the animals join in hugging Grug.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           And eight, and nine.

          Douglas runs up and licks Thunk.

                          THUNK

           Douglas! Dad you saved him!

                          GRUG

           Well, a boys gotta have a pet.

          Suddenly the group rises up as the Macawnivore stands

          near them.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Turns out, I'm a cat person.

          Grug notices a TAIL sticking out of Chunky's mouth.

          90.

                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Uh! No.

          Chunky SPITS OUT the TRIP-GERBILS. He GRINS sheepishly.

          The TRIP-GERBILS run to Gran knocking her over in their

          excitement.

                          EEP

           You really need to see this.

          The whole family takes this amazing view in then looks to

          Grug for his decision.

                          GRUG

           We should go there.

                          DISSOLVE TO:

          SEQ. 3500 - EPILOGUE

          RUSHING TOWARD A SHORELINE covered in dense palms, gentle

          waves lapping at the sand.

          On Eep, fixing her hair. We PULL OUT to see the whole

          family preparing for a family photo.

           EEP (V.O.)

           This is me. My name's Eep. And this, is

           my family. The Croods. If you weren't

           clued in by the sun tans and pets, we're

           not exactly cavemen anymore.

          Grug has a wonderful picture making contraption they are

          about to experience. The slab of rock smacks them all in

          the face leaving the first family photo.

                          THUNK

           Let's do that again. I think I blinked.

          BACK TO THE SHORELINE, RUSHING ever closer to the beach.

                          EEP

           Our world is still plenty harsh and

           hostile. But now we know the Croods will

           make it.

          ON BELT riding on the back of the Crocopup, delivering a

          drink to Gran, PULL OUT to reveal she is in a sled,

          hitched to a team of Liyotes. The liyotes are tending to

          her. Gran sips her drink.

          91.

                          EEP(CONT'D)

           Because we changed the rules. The ones

           that kept us in the dark.

          On Ugga sharpening a spear. The Macawnivore comes in to

          frame with Grug riding on top. Ugga tosses him the spear.

          Eep, flips from out of the trees. She blows her horn to

          call Guy and the BearOwl for a ride.

                          EEP (CONT'D)

           And because of my dad, who taught us that

           anyone can change...

          The Macawnivore LEAPS through the trees onto a broad,

          beautiful beach with Grug and Ugga atop.

                          GRUG

           Release the baby!

                          EEP

           Well, sort of.

          Thunk breaks through the trees riding a LANDWHALE. Sandy

          and Belt are riding the Crocopup. Eep and Guy are riding

          the BearOwl.

                          EEP (CONT'D)

           So from now on we'll stay out here.

          The first camera picks them up as it reaches the beach.

          It FOLLOWS the Croods as they TURN and ride toward a

          sunrise.

                          EEP (CONT'D)

           Where we can follow the light.

          FLARE TO WHITE

                         BEAT

          Belt and Sandy poke their heads up at the base of the

          screen.

                          BELT/SANDY

           Da da daaaaaaaaaaa.
