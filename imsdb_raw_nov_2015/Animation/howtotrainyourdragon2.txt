           EXT. OPEN SEA - DAY

           Hiccup and Toothless BLUR PAST, leaving a wake that leads...                         

           EXT. BERK - DAY

           (Sequence 0200 - New Berk)

           To the island village of Berk, festively adorned with flags

           and banners. Major new additions alter its familiar skyline.

           HICCUP (V.O.)

           This... is Berk. The best kept

           secret this side of, well,

           anywhere. Granted, it may not look

           like much, but this wet heap of

           rock packs more than a few

           surprises.

          ON A CLUSTER OF SHEEP, hiding nervously between buildings as

          shadows of passing dragons race by. The group moves as one,

          receding into a shadowy alley, pushing one sheep out into the

          light. It's suddenly snatched and carried into the air!

           HICCUP (V.O.)

           Life here is amazing, just not for

           the faint of heart. See, where most

           folks enjoy hobbies like whittling

           or needlepoint, we Berkians prefer

           a little something we like to call--

          WHOOSH, WHOOSH, WHOOSH! A wash of VIBRANT COLORS blurs by.

          DRAGONS BARREL PAST at a dizzying speed. Their RIDERS SWIPE,

          KICK, and ROLL into one another while they WEAVE neck in neck

          between the houses, docks, and revamped structures of Berk.

           HICCUP (V.O.)

           DRAGON RACING!

          It's like an aerial version of the Monte Carlo race.

          Spectators ROAR from wooden bleachers, fastened to cliff

          faces and perched over the sea.

          FISHLEGS, now 20 and even larger, rides his gronkle, MEATLUG,

          who carries the sheep in her claws, until...

          SNOTLOUT, also 20, but every bit as juvenile, and his

          Monstrous Nightmare, HOOKFANG, steal the sheep from them.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 2.

                          SNOTLOUT

           Oh, I'm sorry, Fishlegs! Did you

           want that?

                          FISHLEGS

           Snotlout! That's mine!

          Snotlout FALLS BACK toward RUFFNUT and TUFFNUT, who lag on

          their two-headed Zippleback, BARF & BELCH.

                          SNOTLOUT

           Here ya go, babe.

          With a chivalrous grin, Snotlout tosses the sheep to Ruffnut.

          She SNATCHES it with a sneer and a GRUMBLE.

                          SNOTLOUT (CONT'D)

           Did I tell you that you look

           amazing today? `Cause you do.

                          RUFFNUT

           Come on, Barf. It's starting to

           stink around here.

          Barf starts to peel off, spewing gas. Tuffnut mocks Snotlout

          with a mugging grin.

                          TUFFNUT

           Nope. Still hates you. Let's blow

           this place, Belch!

          Belch ignites the gas, sparking a flashy explosion, and

          leaving Snotlout behind in the smoke.

          As they rush past the main bleachers, Ruffnut DROPS her sheep

          into one of five baskets suspended over a chasm at the lap

          crossing. Each backboard bears an image of its corresponding

          dragon. The Barf/Belch basket filled to the brim with sheep.

          Presiding over the game, STOICK turns to the frenzied crowd.

                          STOICK

           That's nine for the Twins, Astrid

           lags with three, Fishlegs and

           Snotlout trail with NONE!

          Stoick eyes an empty basket at the far end, its backboard

          painted with an image of Toothless.

                          STOICK (CONT'D)

           And Hiccup is... nowhere to be

           found. Hmmm.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 3.

                          GOBBER

           Scared him off with the big talk,

           didn't ya, Stoick?

          WHACK! Snotlout, still smoldering from the blast, gets

          CLIPPED from behind. ASTRID, rolls in, astride STORMFLY --

          spirited and competitive as ever, and beautiful despite

          herself.

                          ASTRID

           What are you doing, Snotlout?!

           They're going to win now!

                          SNOTLOUT

           She's my princess! Whatever she

           wants, she gets.

                          ASTRID

           Ruffnut?! Didn't she try to bury

           you alive?!

                          SNOTLOUT

           Only for a few hours!

          BACK TO THE RACERS, as they peel away, pouring on the speed.

           HICCUP (V.O.)

           Dragons used to be a bit of a

           problem here. But that was five

           years ago. Now they've all moved

           in. And, really, why wouldn't they?

          The racers chase each other through a sprawling hangar and

          into a vast cave, teeming with colorfully painted dragon

          stables. They exit through the far side and circle back

          through the village, blasting past many of its dragon-

          friendly additions.

           HICCUP (V.O.)

           We have custom stables... all-you-

           can-eat feeding stations... a full

           service dragon wash...

          In the village, a baby Gronkle sneezes, accidentally setting

          one of the Viking houses aflame.

           HICCUP (V.O.)

           Even top-of-the-line fire

           prevention, if I do say so myself.

          Astrid rolls her eyes, peels away from the other dragon

          racers, and yanks open a spout on the overhead network of

          aqueducts, dousing the flames with a surge of water.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 4.

          BACK TO STOICK, amused as he watches the racers round the

          island, searching for sheep. He turns to Gobber and nods.

                          STOICK

           It's time, Gobber.

                          GOBBER

           Righty-ho!

           (aloud, to the crowd)

           Last lap!

          A HORN sounds. The racers all turn to each other, excited.

                          ASTRID

           The black sheep! Come on, Stormfly!

           We can still win this thing!

                          RUFFNUT

           Come on, Barf!

                          TUFFNUT

           Let's go!

                          FISHLEGS

           Go, Meatlug!

          GOBBER loads the BLACK SHEEP onto a catapult.

                          GOBBER

           This is your big moment. Have a

           nice flight!

          He pulls the trigger, LAUNCHING the black sheep into the air.

          Astrid spots it and steers Stormfly into a steep climb toward

          it.

                          ASTRID

           Up, up, up!

          In a flash, Fishlegs and Meatlug blur past, NABBING the

          sheep.

                          ASTRID (CONT'D)

           No!

                          FISHLEGS

           Good job, Meatlug!

          Fishlegs tosses his captured prize to Ruffnut.

                          FISHLEGS (CONT'D)

           Here you go, darling. Mine's worth

           ten!

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 5.

                          RUFFNUT

           Yeah! The Black Sheep!

          Snotlout sighs, frustrated.

                          ASTRID

           You guys are fighting for Ruffnut?!

                          RUFFNUT

           I'm totally winning!

          Fishlegs hovers up nest to Ruffnut with a starry-eyed smile.

                          FISHLEGS

           We're winning together!

          She RAMS BARF into Meatlug, sending Fishlegs into an

          uncontrolled SPIN. He SLAMS into Snotlout, sending their

          dragons TUMBLING head over tail. The crowd goes wild.

                          RUFFNUT

           No one can stop me now!

                          TUFFNUT

           Except for me. We're attached,

           genius!

          He GRABS at the sheep. Ruffnut fights back, inciting a tug-of-

          war.

                          TUFFNUT (CONT'D)

           Quit trying to steal all my glory!

          And while they're distracted, Astrid steers Stormfly toward

          them, CLOSING IN.

                          STOICK

           Get `em, Astrid!

                          TUFFNUT RUFFNUT

          It's MY glory! No sheep, no You're always ruining

          glory! EVERYTHING!

          Astrid leaps off of Stormfly, runs up Belch's spindly neck,

          and PLUCKS the black sheep from the Twins' hands.

                          ASTRID

           Gotcha!

          She tumbles through the air onto Stormfly, sticking a perfect

          landing, black sheep in hand.

                          RUFFNUT

           Astrid!

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 6.

          BACK TO STOICK, beside himself. The crowd ROARS.

                          STOICK

           Well played! Hahaha!

           (gloating, to the crowd)

           That's my future daughter-in-law!

          BACK TO ASTRID ON STORMFLY

          eyeing the fast-approaching FINISH LINE, unaware as...

          FISHLEGS suddenly RAMS Meatlug into Stormfly, sending Astrid

          off-course. She recovers and sees Snotlout flying headlong

          toward her, war hammer cocked, aiming at Astrid.

                          SNOTLOUT

           Uh, excuse me.

                          ASTRID

           Stormfly!

          Snotlout HURLS his hammer. Astrid ducks and rolls Stormfly

          out of the way. The hammer catches Fishlegs in the face with

          a CLANG. The crowd collectively winces.

          Astrid and Stormfly recover from their roll, loop over the

          water, and they BLAST past the finish line, DUNKING the black

          sheep into their basket!

                          STOICK

           That's thirteen! Astrid takes the

           game!

          The crowd COMES UNHINGED. Astrid flies over the crowd,

          basking in her victory.

           HICCUP (V.O.)

           Yep. Berk is pretty much perfect.

           All of my hard work has paid off.

           And it's a good thing, too, because

           with Vikings on the backs of

           dragons, the world just got a whole

           lot bigger.

          EXT. OPEN SKY/ISLAND COASTLINE - DAY

          (Scene 0300 - AWOL Part One)

          A boundless sky. Vast. Clear. Crisp. And from it, a BLACK

          SPECK rockets across the horizon. The image of unbridled

          freedom.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 7.

          Tucked into his riding position, HICCUP appears to be part of

          TOOTHLESS. They dip, roll and dive, over a sea teeming with

          Thunderdrums, pulling off daring maneuvers with honed

          refinement, making them seem effortless.

                          HICCUP

           Yeah!

          They jackknife, heading skyward, rolling and tumbling through

          the ethereal cloud-scapes and joining high-flying Timberjacks

          as they soar in formation.

          Hiccup is bound head-to-toe in a snug, aerodynamic flight

          suit -- an asymmetrical, functional design of leather and

          articulated plates. It has an air of Viking bike leather.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           What do you think, bud? Wanna give

           this another shot?

          Toothless grumbles in protest.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Toothless! It'll be fine.

          With a click of a lever, he LOCKS the pedals in the flared

          tail position. Hiccup then unhooks himself from the saddle.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Ready?

          Toothless SNORTS unenthusiastically.

          Suddenly, Hiccup SLIDES OFF of Toothless, peeling away from

          him like a skydiver from a plane, YELLING as he plummets.

          Toothless dives after him. They spiral through the air, face-

          to-face. Toothless is having fun, despite himself.

          Hiccup slips his forearms through a pair of tucked leather

          flaps... and YANKS, unfurling SHEETS OF LEATHER as he extends

          his arms. They catch the wind, SNAPPING OPEN like WINGS...

          and sending him GLIDING -- out of control, at first, then

          stabilizing. The turbulence buffets his flight suit heavily.

          But he's flying!

          Toothless unfolds his wings, too, catching up with Hiccup.

          The freedom is palpable. Hiccup and Toothless are, for the

          moment, the same. Feeling the same rush of adrenaline.

          Independently together.

          They PLUNGE past cloud formations, splitting apart then

          crossing paths again.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 8.

          Impressive as it is, Hiccup is gliding at a steep angle.

          Toothless launches fireballs ahead of Hiccup, boosting him

          higher with the expanding heat bursts.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           This is amazing!

          A cloud layer washes past, exposing a towering ROCK

          FORMATION, dead ahead.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           No longer amazing! Toothless!

          Hiccup tries to steer himself away, to no avail.

          Toothless POURS ON THE SPEED, trying to catch Hiccup as he

          HURTLES toward collision. His locked tail makes maneuvering

          difficult. He's UNABLE TO PULL UP at a steep enough angle.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Oh, no!

          At the last second, Toothless BLASTS the jagged rocks just

          ahead of Hiccup, then WRAPS Hiccup in his wings as they fly

          through it. The obliterated peak rains down around them.

          Toothless emerges through the cloud of debris and HURTLES

          into the trees of a neighboring peak. They tumble down the

          uneven terrain, coming to rest on a small plateau.

          Hiccup emerges from the cocoon of Toothless' wings. He

          switches his prosthetic riding foot to his walking foot and

          stows his leather wings.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           That really came out of nowhere.

          The blown up sea stack collapses.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           We gotta work on your solo gliding

           there, bud. That locked-up tail

           makes for some pretty sloppy rescue

           maneuvers, eh?

          Hiccup reels in his dorsal fin and removes his helmet,

          revealing a 20 year old Hiccup framed by wild hair, complete

          with a Viking braid.

          He walks to the edge of the cliff, taking in the NEW LAND

          stretching off into the horizon, its tall cliffs and sea-

          stacks adorned with swaying gold birch trees basking in the

          dappled afternoon sunlight.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 9.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Looks like we found another one,

           bud.

          Toothless FUSSES and SNORTS, not amused, shaking off dust and

          pebbles like a wet dog.

          Hiccup flinches as a pebble WHACKS him on the back of the

          head. He looks back to Toothless, who averts his eyes.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Oh, what? Do you want an apology?

           Is that why you're pouting, big

           baby boo? Well... try this on!

          Hiccup TACKLES Toothless and tries to put him in a headlock.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Ya feeling it yet? Huh? Picking up

           on all my heartfelt remorse?

          Toothless simply stands on his hind legs, lifting Hiccup off

          of his flailing feet and dangling him over the cliff's edge.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Oh, come on. You wouldn't hurt a

                          ONE-LEGGED--

          Hiccup looks down, seeing the precipitous drop below.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           You're right! You're right! You

           win! You win!

          WHAM! Toothless flips him over, pinning him to the ground.

          Hiccup squirms, throwing mock punches. Toothless playfully

          retaliates with feline taps to Hiccup's head.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           He's down! And it's ugly! Dragons

           and Vikings, enemies again, locked

           in combat to the bitter -- URFFF!

          Toothless rests his head on Hiccup -- SQUEEZING THE AIR out

          of him. Toothless then suddenly starts grooming Hiccup,

          lapping at his face and covering him in slobber.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Gaaaaagh!

          Hiccup fights to get free, finally springing to his feet and

          shaking off the viscous saliva.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           You KNOW that doesn't wash out.

          Toothless LAUGHS, pleased with himself.

          Shifting his attention back to the new land stretched out

          before them, Hiccup reaches beneath his chest plate and

          produces a leather-bound book.

          He unfurls it to reveal an EXPLORERS MAP, modified with added

          strips in every direction to accommodate their ever-expanding

          world. Drawings indicate new lands, new tribes, and many new

          dragons.

          Hiccup peels a fresh strip of paper from a hidden fold in his

          flight suit and holds it out for Toothless to lick.

          Hiccup affixes the moistened strip to the map's outer edge,

          then whittles a pencil and consults a compass affixed to his

          forearm.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           So what should we name it?

          Toothless GURGLES as he gnaws under his wing, preoccupied.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           "Itchy Armpit" it is.

          Hiccup carefully draws the new island's outline.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Whaddya reckon, bud? Think we might

           find a few Timberjacks in those

           woods? The odd Whispering Death or

           two in the rocks? Who knows...

           maybe we'll finally track down

           another Night Fury.

                          (BEAT)

           Wouldn't that be something?

                          (BURDENED)

           So, whaddya say? Just keep going?

          Toothless' ear plates suddenly SHOOT UP. He ROARS, and his

          call is answered by a familiar SCREECH. Hiccup turns to

          see...

          EXT. SEA STACK/ISLAND COASTLINE - DAY

          (Scene 0325 - AWOL Part Two)

          ASTRID rising into view, astride Stormfly. Stormfly grabs

          talon-fulls of rock to slow her landing.

                          HICCUP

           `Afternoon m'lady. Where have you

           been?

          Astrid dismounts and throws back her fur hood as Toothless

          rushes up to greet them.

                          ASTRID

           Winning races. What else? The real

           question is... where have YOU been?

                          HICCUP

           Avoiding my dad.

                          ASTRID

           Oh, no. What happened now?

          Astrid sits beside Hiccup, inspecting his latest addition to

          the map. Behind them, Toothless greets Stormfly, inciting a

          play fight.

                          HICCUP

           Oh, you're gonna love this. I wake

           up. The sun's shining. Terrible

           Terrors are singing on the rooftop.

           I saunter down to breakfast,

           thinking all is right with the

           world, and I get...

          He gets to his feet and puffs out his chest.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                          (APING STOICK)

           ... Son, we need to talk.

          Astrid smiles and adopts Hiccup's sloppy slouch.

                          ASTRID

                          (APING HICCUP)

           Not now, Dad. I've got a whole day

           of goofing off to get started.

          Hiccup breaks character, grimacing at her impression of him.

                          HICCUP

           Okay, first of all, I don't sound

           like that. What is this character?

           And second... what is that thing

           you're doing with my shoulders?

          Astrid laughs, jostling her shoulders in an awkward way.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 12.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           A truly flattering impersonation.

           Anyway, he goes...

           (resuming Stoick's brogue)

           You're the pride of Berk, son, and

           I couldn't be prouder...

                          ASTRID

           (continuing her impression

                          OF HICCUP)

           Aw, thanks, Dad. I'm pretty

           impressed with myself, too.

                          HICCUP

           WHEN have I ever done that with my

           hands?

                          ASTRID

           You just did.

          She laughs, playfully.

                          HICCUP

           Okay... just...

           (holding her arms, mock-

                          STERN)

           Hold still. It's very serious.

          She giggles, trying to hold a straight face.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           (resuming Stoick's brogue)

           You're all grown up, and since no

           chief could ask for a better

           successor, I've decided--

          Astrid straightens, her face brightening.

                          ASTRID

           --TO MAKE YOU CHIEF! Oh, my gods!

          She jumps to her feet, beaming...

                          ASTRID (CONT'D)

           Hiccup, that's amazing!

          And socks Hiccup in congratulations, deliberately hitting the

          dorsal fin release button and triggering it to pop up. She

          laughs as Hiccup reels it back in, self-consciously.

                          HICCUP

           You're gonna wear out the spring

           coil. The calibration is very

           sensitive!

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 13.

          They're suddenly BOWLED OVER by Toothless and Stormfly.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Yeah, so... this is what I'm

           dealing with.

          Astrid helps him up and dusts him off.

                          ASTRID

                          (EXCITED)

           What did you tell him?

                          HICCUP

           I didn't. By the time he turned

           around, I was gone.

          Astrid picks up the map, folding it as she paces around him,

          processing it all.

                          ASTRID

           Well, it's a lot of responsibility.

           The map will have to wait for sure,

           and I'll need to fly Toothless,

           since you'll be too busy...

          She pauses, wincing in sympathy. She turns to Hiccup. He nods

          knowingly, taking the map from her.

                          HICCUP

           It's not me, Astrid. All those

           speeches, and planning, and running

           the village... that's his thing.

                          ASTRID

           I think you're missing the point. I

           mean, chief. What an honor. I'd be

           pretty excited.

          Hiccup shakes his head.

                          HICCUP

           I'm not like you. You know exactly

           who you are. You always have.

           But...

          He shuffles to the cliff's edge, gazing out at the new land.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           I'm still looking. I know that I'm

           not my father... and I never met my

           mother... so, what does that make

           me?

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 14.

          He sits at the edge, looking burdened, restless. Astrid

          approaches and settles beside him, joining him in looking out

          at the distant horizon. She weaves another braid into his

          hair as she speaks.

                          ASTRID

           What you're searching for... isn't

           out there, Hiccup.

          She places a hand on his chest.

                          ASTRID (CONT'D)

           It's in here.

                          (BEAT)

           Maybe you just don't see it yet.

          She kisses his cheek, but gets a mouthful of Toothless'

          slobber. She grimaces, wiping it off.

          Distracted, Hiccup eyes the horizon keenly.

                          HICCUP

           Maybe. But, y'know... there is

           something out there.

                          ASTRID

                          (EXASPERATED)

           Hiccup...

          He turns her face to the horizon. A distant smoke plume rises

          from a misty valley.

          EXT. LAPLAND WOODS/TRAPPER'S FORT - MOMENTS LATER

          (Scene 0400 - Shot Down!)

          Hiccup and Toothless fly over the fjord, winding deep through

          undulating crimson and gold forests.

          Astrid and Stormfly catch up as the autumn colors suddenly

          give way to charred timbers. They fly deeper, through ash and

          wafting smoke. Ahead, in a sheltered harbor, an explosion of

          ice stands as an eerie marker of what used to be a TRAPPER'S

          FORT.

                          HICCUP

           Stay close.

          They fly through the suspended remains of the buildings,

          splintered, and frozen in mid-destruction.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           What happened here?

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 15.

          It's at once harrowing and puzzling. Toothless spots an

          enormous DRAGON FOOTPRINT in the muddy shoreline below,

          leaving him uneasy.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Easy, bud.

          As they crest the ice formations, Astrid spots a CREW OF MEN

          at the stern of a moored ship below.

                          ASTRID

           Hiccup!

           ERET (O.S.)

           Fire!

          The men fire a stern-mounted cannon. The projectile unfurls

          into a NET. Hiccup and Toothless dart out of its way.

                          HICCUP

           Astrid! Look out!

          It HITS Stormfly, TANGLING her wings and causing her to spin

          uncontrolled. Astrid struggles to free her as they HURTLE

          toward a collision.

                          ASTRID

           HICCUP!

          Astrid falls off of Stormfly, but Toothless SNATCHES her at

          the last second.

          Stormfly hits the ground, tangled in the net. Trappers rush

          out of hiding, piling onto her with ropes and weapons. She

          whips her tail, sending spikes flying.

                          ERET

           Watch the tail!

          A large, raven-haired trapper lunges over the spray of spikes

          and lands upon Stormfly's head, twisting it and taking her

          down like a rodeo cowboy.

                          ERET (CONT'D)

           Tie those legs up!

          Eret deftly ties her gnashing jaws shut, wrangling her into

          submission -- clearly a pro among pros. He looks up,

          revealing a handsome face and gleaming, intelligent eyes that

          search the sky as Toothless' tell-tale BANSHEE scream rings

          out.

                          ERET (CONT'D)

           Is that what I think it is?

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 16.

          Toothless suddenly streaks across the sky, banking and

          landing with a FEROCIOUS ROAR.

                          HICCUP

           STOP!

                          ASTRID

           STORMFLY!

           (to the trappers)

           What are you doing?

          Astrid and Hiccup leap off of Toothless, rushing toward

          Stormfly.

          Eret's men immediately draw weapons. Hiccup extends and

          ignites his DRAGON BLADE -- a telescoping fiery sword --

          impressive enough to wow Eret's men.

                          ERET

           Back again?

          Eret steps forward, focused only on Toothless.

                          ERET (CONT'D)

           Soil my britches... that is a Night

           Fury. Thought they were all gone

           for good.

           (to his fellow trappers)

           Looks like our luck's had a turn

           for the better, lads! Don't think

           Drago has one of those in his

           dragon army.

          His men sound out in agreement. Hiccup eyes Astrid, confused.

                          ASTRID

           Dragon army?

                          HICCUP

           Look, we don't want any trouble.

                          ERET

           Ha! You should've thought of that

           before you stole all of our dragons

           and blasted our fort to bits!

                          HICCUP

           Wait...

                          ASTRID

           What are you talking about?

          Astrid and Hiccup take in the icy destruction, putting it

          together.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 17.

                          HICCUP

           You think we did this?

                          ERET

           Dragon trapping is hard enough work

           as it is, without do-gooder dragon

           riders sneaking in to rescue them.

                          HICCUP

           What do-gooder -- there are other

           dragon riders?

                          ERET

           You mean, other than your thieving

           friend from last night? You tell

           me.

          Eret approaches. Toothless snarls, protectively.

                          ERET (CONT'D)

           You may have an ice-spitting dragon

           on your side, but we still have a

           quota to fill. How do you suppose

           we explain this mess to Drago

           Bludvist?

                          HICCUP

           Drago what-fist? Does anything you

           say make sense?

                          TEENY

           He's expecting a new shipment of

           dragons for his army by tomorrow.

                          NO-NAME

           And Drago don't take well to

           excuses.

          Eret parts his tunic, revealing a large branding-iron scar on

          his torso, in the shape of a dragon skull, split by a sword.

                          ERET

           This is what he gave me last time I

           showed up empty-handed. He promised

           to be far less understanding in the

           future.

                          HICCUP

                          (EXASPERATED)

           Look, we don't know anything about

           a dragon thief, or an ice-spitting

           dragon, or your lunatic boss and

           his dragon army, okay?

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Just give us back our dragon, and

           we'll go, strange, hostile person

           whom we've never met.

          Eret bows playfully.

                          ERET

           Oh, where are my manners? I'm Eret.

           Son of Eret. Finest dragon trapper

           alive.

          He pulls a dagger from behind his back, waving it cockily.

          His men ready their weapons and net cannons.

                          ERET (CONT'D)

           After all, it's not just anyone who

           can capture a Night Fury.

          Toothless ROARS a warning.

                          HICCUP

           And this is Toothless. He says

           we're going. Now.

                          ERET

           Heh. They all say that.

                          (BEAT)

           RUSH `EM, LADS!

          Eret lunges toward them. Toothless BLASTS, bringing down a

          massive spire of ice. It shatters as it hits the ground,

          forcing Eret and his men to dive out of the way.

          Making quick use of the distraction, Hiccup re-ignites his

          dragon blade and slashes through the ropes binding Stormfly.

                          ASTRID

           Stormfly! C'mon, go! Go!

          Eret gets to his feet in time to see Toothless and Stormfly

          take to the air, carrying Hiccup and Astrid out of reach of

          the volley of arrows.

                          ERET

           YOU WILL NEVER HOLD ON TO THOSE

           DRAGONS, YOU HEAR ME?! DRAGO IS

           COMING FOR THEM ALL!

          I/E. BERK/BLACKSMITH STALL - SUNSET

          (Sequence 0500 - Lock-Down!)

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 19.

          The GANG joyrides past GOTHI'S house, scattering her

          assortment of terrible terrors. She waves a fist at them as

          they sweep past, WHOOPING AND CHORTLING, leading us down

          to...

          THE UPPER PLAZA, where a GATHERED CROWD of Vikings and their

          dragons are cued up outside of Gobber's BLACKSMITH STALL,

          awaiting their turns. Stoick maneuvers through the crowd,

          spouting JOVIAL GREETINGS in passing.

          He makes a bee-line for GOBBER, who is busily grinding a

          metal dragon tooth into shape. A Zippleback waits patiently,

          his head cocked open like a car hood while the other head

          watches, sympathetically.

                          STOICK

           Any sign of him?

          Gobber flips up his welding guard, revealing a matching area

          of unsoiled skin.

                          GOBBER

           Ah, he's probably flown off the

           edge of the world by now. You sure

           you want that kid running the

           village? You can still delay your

           retirement.

                          STOICK

           Oh, he's ready. You'll see.

          A SUDDEN EXCITEMENT in the crowd heralds Hiccup and Astrid's

          return. They touch down on Toothless and Stormfly.

                          STOICK (CONT'D)

           Haha! There he is!

           (to Gobber, proving his

                          POINT)

           Huh? The pride of Berk!

          Hiccup stows his helmet and heads toward Stoick with urgency.

                          GOBBER

           Who finally decided to show up for

           work. Yay.

                          HICCUP

           Sorry. Got held up.

           (privately, to Stoick)

           Hey, Dad, could I have a word?

                          STOICK

           Something you're itching to tell

           me?

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 20.

                          HICCUP

           Not quite the itch you're thinking

           of, but yes.

          Stoick hands him an apron and guides him to the front desk.

                          STOICK

           Good man! Now, lesson one. A

           chief's first duty is to his

           people. So...

          Stoick changes the rune on the "being served" placard.

                          STOICK (CONT'D)

           Forty one? Forty --

                          HICCUP

           Could we just talk in private for--

                          STARKARD

           --That's me! That's me! I'm next!

           (pushing his way through)

           I was ahead of you! Excuse me, I've

           been here all day!

          STARKARD reaches the counter, giddy with excitement.

                          STARKARD (CONT'D)

           Okay, I want one of those high

           seaters, with lots of spikes and a

           big stowage compartment.

                          STOICK

           Absolutely! You got it, sir!

          Stoick spins Hiccup around, steering him back into the shop.

                          HICCUP

           Dad, this is actually a little more

           important than building saddles.

                          STOICK

           Ah-ah! Lesson two. No task is too

           small when it comes to serving your

           people. Excuse us, Grump.

          They step over the tail of a large, snoring oaf of a dragon,

          stirring him awake with a fussy start.

                          GOBBER

           Grump! You let the forge die down

           again!

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 21.

          Grump coughs a slug of molten lava into the forge. It

          splatters everywhere, igniting a rash of fires. Hiccup side-

          steps them as he gathers materials in the back of the stall.

          Gobber pulls the fire extinguisher, dumping water everywhere.

                          GOBBER (CONT'D)

           That's it, Grump. You're going up

           for adoption!

          Stoick fills a toolbox with tools from Hiccup's workbench.

                          STOICK

           One of these. And this...

                          HICCUP

                          DAD --

                          STOICK

           -- There you go! Go on. Have away.

                          HICCUP

           But, seriously, I really need to

           tell you about this new land we

           came across.

                          GOBBER

           Another one?!

          Fishlegs walks in, followed by the Twins and Snotlout.

                          FISHLEGS

           Any new dragons?

          Stoick slaps a sheet of leather onto a dragon mold, and hands

          Hiccup pencil. Exasperated, Hiccup begins tracing an outline

          as he speaks.

                          HICCUP

           We didn't stick around to find out.

           These folks weren't particularly

           friendly.

                          GOBBER

           Oh, really? Your Night Fury and

           Deadly Nadder didn't bring them

           cheering to the rooftops?

          Gobber spins his prosthetic arm dispenser.

                          HICCUP

           No, this was different. Not the

           standard run-for-the-hills hoo-ha

           I've come to enjoy. These guys were

           trappers. Dragon trappers.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 22.

                          ASTRID

           You should've seen their fort. All

           blown apart and stuck in giant

           spikes of ice. It was weird.

                          HICCUP

           I've never seen anything like it.

           And worst of all, they thought we

           did it!

          Gobber pops off his prosthetic tongs and selects a wire brush

          from his dispenser...

                          GOBBER

           Y'know, you two are gonna get

           yourselves in SERIOUS trouble one

           of these days. Not everyone

           appreciates this way of life.

          Which he uses to brush his mustache and eyebrows.

          Stoick takes the sheet of leather to the table saw...

                          STOICK

           Gobber's right, son. Best we keep

           to our own. Besides, you'll have

           more important uses for your time --

          And pulls a lever, starting it up.

                          STOICK (CONT'D)

           (sing-songy, under his

                          BREATH)

           Once we make the big announcement!

          Hiccup pulls the lever, shutting the saw down.

                          HICCUP

           They are building a dragon army.

          Silence fills the stall. Vikings exchange worried glances.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Or at least the guy they work for

           is. Dargo Bloody Fist or something.

          Stoick's eyes widen. He turns to Gobber, with growing alarm.

                          TUFFNUT

           I'll bloody his fist with my face

           if he tries to take my dragon!

                          RUFFNUT

           Or mine.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 23.

                          TUFFNUT

           You're such a moron.

                          FISHLEGS

           A beautiful moron.

                          SNOTLOUT

           Yeah...

          Ruffnut grumbles, revolted by their advances.

          Stoick grabs Hiccup by the shoulders, wide-eyed and intense.

                          STOICK

           Bludvist? Drago Bludvist?

                          HICCUP

           Uh, yeah. Wait. You know him?

          INT. BERK - DRAGON STABLES - MOMENTS LATER

          Stoick rushes down a circular stone staircase into the vast,

          bustling cave that houses the dragon stables.

                          STOICK

           GROUND ALL DRAGONS!

                          HICCUP

           What? Why?!

          Hiccup, Astrid, Gobber, and Toothless chase after Stoick.

                          STOICK

           SEAL THE GATES! LOWER THE STORM

           DOORS!

                          HICCUP

           Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait! What is

           happening?

                          GOBBER

           You heard the man! Lock it down!

          Behind him, the massive storm doors rattle as they're

          lowered.

                          STOICK

           No DRAGON or VIKING sets foot off

           this island until I give the word!

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 24.

                          HICCUP

           Because some guy you knew is

           stirring up trouble in some faraway

           land?

          Stoick turns to Hiccup, gravely serious.

                          STOICK

           Because Drago Bludvist is a madman.

           Without conscience or mercy. And if

           he's built a dragon army... gods

           help us all.

          Stoick continues on shouting orders, leaving Hiccup stewing.

                          STOICK (CONT'D)

           Get them into their pens! Quickly!

          Hiccup chases around to confront Stoick.

                          HICCUP

           Then let's ride back out there.

           We'll follow those trappers to

           Drago and talk some sense into him.

                          STOICK

           No. We fortify the island.

                          HICCUP

           It's our duty to keep the peace!

                          STOICK

           Peace is over, Hiccup. I must

           prepare you for war.

                          HICCUP

           War? Dad, if Drago's coming for our

           dragons, we can't wait around for

           him to get here. Let's go find him

           and change his mind.

                          STOICK

           Some minds won't be changed,

           Hiccup. Berk is what you need to

           worry about.

                          (BEAT)

           A chief protects his own.

          Stoick heads off, calling out more orders...

                          STOICK (CONT'D)

           SECURE THE STABLES! LATCH EVERY

           STALL!

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 25.

          ... leaving Hiccup eyeing Toothless as the storm doors close.

          Astrid approaches him, seeing the determination on his face.

                          ASTRID

           Hiccup, don't.

                          HICCUP

           I have to.

          He gives her a quick peck on the cheek.

                          STOICK

           THIS WAY! QUICKLY!

          Hiccup and Toothless BLAST PAST, heading for the exit.

                          STOICK (CONT'D)

           HICCUP!

          They try to fly through one door, but it seals shut.

                          HICCUP

           Come on!

          Toothless spins around and DIVES through the gap in the

          second lowering storm door.

                          STOICK

           Hiccup!

          Astrid and Stormfly blow past Stoick and slip through the

          storm door before it shuts, leaving Stoick fuming.

          EXT. OPEN SEA - MIDDAY

          (Scene 0700 - Eret's Lesson)

          Eret's ship carves a defiant path North, leaving the last

          glimpses of Lapland in its wake.

          Eret stands on the bowsprit, eyeing the waves intently,

          searching the surface. He turns toward the deck, where his

          crewmen man the gunwale cannons, sights trained to the sky.

                          ERET

           Keep your eyes peeled, lads! With

           this wind, we'll reach Drago by

           daybreak, so best we fill this ship

           up with dragons and quick! It's no

           time to be picky. Not if we want to

           keep our --

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 26.

                          UG

           Uh... Eret?

          Eret turns in the direction Ug is pointing to see a pair of

          dragons flapping toward them.

                          ERET

           HEADS! OFF THE PORT QUARTER!

          The crewmen swing the net cannons toward the back-lit,

          silhouetted dragons, drawing ever closer.

                          ERET (CONT'D)

           Net `em, lads! Take `em down!

          Eret loads a cannon and takes aim. He spots Hiccup and Astrid

          riding the dragons. His eyes narrow, determined.

                          ERET (CONT'D)

           You're not getting away this time.

          Nets fly through the air. Hiccup and Astrid outmaneuver them

          and dive toward the ship, landing on the deck with a clatter.

                          ERET (CONT'D)

           And here I was worried we might

           turn up empty-handed.

          Astrid brandishes her axe in invitation. Hiccup indicates for

          her to lower it, then holds up his hands in surrender.

                          HICCUP

           Nope. It's your lucky day. We give

           up.

          Eret's crew exchange confused stares. As does Astrid.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           That's one Night Fury, one Deadly

           Nadder, and...

          He dismounts Toothless and tosses a net over Astrid.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           ... two of the finest dragon riders

           west of Luk Tuk. That oughtta make

           the boss happy, right?

          Astrid grumbles. He takes her axe, hands it to Eret, and

          escorts Astrid past the men to the open live well.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Excuse us.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 27.

          He leads Astrid down the ladder. She glares at him, plainly

          hating the plan.

                          ASTRID

           What are you doing?

          Toothless tries to follow them, but Hiccup holds him back.

                          HICCUP

           Toothless, stay.

          Hiccup flips the latch, lowering the grate as Eret watches,

          confounded.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           The dragons don't really care for

           cramped spaces, so they'll just

           hang out with you. They won't be

           any trouble.

          Eret's men nervously direct their swords and spears toward

          Toothless. HE SNARLS.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Unless you do that. Wooden boat,

           big ocean. How's your swimming?

                          NO-NAME

           Not good.

          A burst of flame erupts from the live well, causing the

          crewmen to jump back. Hiccup thrusts his Dragon Blade through

          the grate.

                          HICCUP

           Oops. Almost forgot. Can't have

           armed prisoners!

                          ASTRID

           How is this a plan?

          He retracts the blade and offers it up. A crewman cautiously

          takes it, looking it over. The pommel of the hilt is

          expelling green gas.

                          HICCUP

           Just what every dragon trapper

           needs. One end coats the blade in

           Monstrous Nightmare saliva. The

           other sprays Hideous Zippleback

           gas. All it takes is a spark and...

          A curious crewman clicks the lighter, igniting the gas.

          Hiccup ducks as the sudden explosion sweeps over the deck.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 28.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Oh, yeah, there you go!

          Toothless paws at the embers.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Once they see you as one of their

           own, even the testiest dragons can

           be trained, right, bud?

          Toothless gurgles and falls over.

                          ERET

           Give me that!

          Eret snatches the dragon blade and HURLS it overboard.

          Stormfly bolts after it...

                          ERET (CONT'D)

           What game are you playing?

                          HICCUP

           No game. We just want to meet

           Drago.

          And returns in a flash, dropping it at Eret's feet like a

          fetching dog, tongue wagging. Eret throws it again,

          frustrated. Stormfly returns with it just as quickly.

                          ERET

           Why?

                          HICCUP

           Because I'm going to change his

           mind about dragons.

          Eret and his crew LAUGH. Astrid pokes out of the well.

                          ASTRID

           He can be really persuasive.

          Hiccup pets Toothless, thoughtfully.

                          HICCUP

           Once you've earned his loyalty,

           there is nothing a dragon won't do

           for you.

                          ERET

           Puh! You won't be changing any

           minds around here.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 29.

                          HICCUP

           I can change yours. Right here.

           Right now.

          Hiccup sets Toothless' tail in the locked, splayed position.

          Eret sneers, suspicious.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           May I?

          Suddenly, Hiccup is snatched into the air! Dragons blur past.

          I/E. OPEN SEA - SHIP - SUNSET

          (Scene 1000 - Botched Rescue)

          The crewmen SCRAMBLE to the NET CANNONS as a FLURRY OF WINGS

          streak past, GASHING holes in the sails and SLICING through

          rigging.

                          ERET

           Dragon riders!

          Toothless SHRIEKS and bounds up the mast, spotting Hiccup in

          the talons of a Monstrous Nightmare. Toothless relaxes,

          realizing that it's Hookfang.

                          HICCUP

           Put me down! Snotlout! What are you

           doing?

          Snotlout looks back to see if Ruffnut witnessed the save.

                          SNOTLOUT

           See how well I protect and provide?

          Ruffnut GRUMBLES at the incessant courting. A FLYING NET

          whizzes past her head.

                          TUFFNUT

           Aggh! What is with all the nets?!

                          RUFFNUT

           Hey watch it! That was close...

          Ruffnut spots Eret, FIRING nets from the deck of the ship.

                          TRANSITION TO:

          A SLOW MOTION, sexy POV of Eret's glistening biceps,

          shuddering as he BLASTS the net cannon, aimed directly at

          her.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 30.

                          RUFFNUT (CONT'D)

           Oh, my.

          The net unravels in SLOW MOTION...

                          RUFFNUT (CONT'D)

           Me likey.

          ... enveloping Ruffnut as she yields to it, blissfully.

                          RUFFNUT (CONT'D)

           Take me.

          BACK TO REAL TIME

          As Hiccup FLIPS upside-down in the Hookfang's talons and

          KICKS off, pulling his wing-suit flaps.

          Eret takes aim, but Astrid SHOVES him, throwing off the shot.

                          ASTRID

           HOLD YOUR FIRE!

          Hiccup glides unsteadily towards the ship and collides with

          its sail. He slides down the canvas and drops to the deck.

          Toothless lands behind him.

                          HICCUP

           WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?!

          Gobber and Grump land on the deck, scattering Eret's crew.

                          GOBBER

           We're here to RESCUE you!

                          HICCUP

           I DON'T NEED to be rescued!

           STOICK (O.S.)

           ENOUGH!

          The bow dips heavily as Stoick touches down on SKULLCRUSHER.

          He dismounts, fuming.

          Eret blocks Stoick, cocky and confident.

                          ERET

           Well, didn't you just pick the

           wrong ship, eh? I am Eret, son of --

          Stoick shoves his face aside, sending Eret SLAMMING into

          Grump. Before he can react, Gobber CLUBS Eret on the head,

          sending him collapsing to the deck. Grump then sits on him,

          smothering him into submission.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 31.

                          ERET (CONT'D)

           (panting, suffocated)

           Get... this... thing... off... me!

          Gobber turns to the other crewmen, with a smile.

                          GOBBER

           Anyone else?

          Eret's men eye the Vikings, armed and flanked by their

          dragons. They set down their swords.

                          GOBBER (CONT'D)

           That's what I figured.

                          STOICK

                          (TO HICCUP)

           You. Saddle up. We're going home.

                          HICCUP

           No.

                          STOICK

           Of all the irresponsible --

                          HICCUP

           -- I'm trying to protect our

           dragons and stop a war! How is that

           irresponsible?

                          STOICK

           BECAUSE WAR IS WHAT HE WANTS, SON!

          Hiccup glares, frustrated.

          Stoick SIGHS, realizing that he has to explain.

                          STOICK (CONT'D)

           Years ago, there was a great

           gathering of chieftains to discuss

           the dragon scourge we all faced.

          INT. VIKING HALL - NIGHT

                         FLASHBACK

          A hulking, cloaked figure strides confidently into fire-lit

          hall, interrupting a council meeting of Viking chieftains.

          His face is masked in silhouette.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 32.

           STOICK (V.O.)

           Into our midst came a stranger from

           a strange land, covered in scars

           and draped in a cloak of dragon

           skin. He carried no weapon and

           spoke softly, saying that he, Drago

           Bludvist, was a man of the people,

           devoted to freeing mankind from the

           tyranny of dragons.

          ON STOICK, some twenty years younger, seated in a throne,

          studying the impudent stranger with suspicion.

           STOICK (V.O.)

           He claimed that he alone could

           control the dragons and that he

           alone could keep us safe, if we

           chose to bow down and follow him.

          The Viking council erupts in mocking laughter.

          BACK TO PRESENT

          Snotlout, Fishlegs, and the Twins snicker.

                          RUFFNUT

           Stupid.

                          TUFFNUT

           Good one.

                          STOICK

           Aye. We laughed, too...

          BACK TO FLASHBACK

                          STOICK (CONT'D)

           Until he wrapped himself in his

           cloak and cried out, "Then see how

           well you do without me!"

          Drago Bludvist pulls the dragon skin cloak over himself and

          marches toward the door. Above, dragon fire rips through the

          ceiling, bringing down flaming timbers, followed by dragons

          covered in heavy metallic armor. They BLAST FIRE as panic

          ensues.

           STOICK (V.O.)

           The rooftop suddenly burst into

           flames, and from it, armored

           dragons descended, burning the hall

           to the ground.

          BACK TO PRESENT

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 33.

                          STOICK

                          (STINGING REGRET)

           I... was to only one to escape.

          The Twins, Snotlout, and Fishlegs exchange spooked glances.

                          STOICK (CONT'D)

                          (TO HICCUP)

           Men who kill without reason cannot

           be reasoned with.

                          HICCUP

           Maybe.

          Hiccup turns and stomps toward Toothless, determined. Eret

          watches intently.

                          STOICK

           Hiccup...

                          HICCUP

           I'm still going to try.

          Hiccup jumps onto Toothless and locks eyes with Stoick.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           This is what I'm good at. And if I

           could change your mind... I can

           change his, too.

                          (TO TOOTHLESS)

           Come on.

          Toothless and Hiccup TAKE TO THE AIR, leaving everyone

          stirring in awkward silence.

          Astrid mounts Stormfly, about to go after him.

                          ASTRID

           Let's go.

                          STOICK

           NO! Lead the others back to Berk.

           I've had enough mutiny for one day.

          Astrid stirs, conflicted, as Stoick stomps toward

          Skullcrusher, fuming. He passes Ruffnut, who's busily

          fondling Eret's biceps as he lays crushed under Grump.

                          RUFFNUT

           Ooh, I like that.

                          STOICK

           Ruffnut!

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 34.

                          RUFFNUT

                          (PETULANT)

           Ugh! Okay!

          EXT. SKY - NIGHT

          (Scene 1100 - Ambushed!)

          Hiccup stares ahead, frustrated, as Toothless glides over a

          bed of clouds, glowing in the low, Arctic sun.

          Hiccup YELLS, then slumps back onto the saddle.

          Toothless recoils, sensitive to Hiccup's upset. The steam

          from their breath mixes in the frigid air.

                          HICCUP

           Don't worry, bud. I'm not gonna let

           anything happen to you. I promise.

          Toothless' ear plates perk up. He glances over his shoulder

          to see a disturbance in the blanket of clouds.

          A strange and arresting MASKED WARRIOR rises from the clouds,

          standing upon something unseen. Its armor and cape flap in

          the buffeting turbulence.

          The warrior eyes Toothless and Hiccup, pulling up alongside

          them. Hiccup senses the approaching figure in his periphery

          and sits up, flustered.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           AW, COME ON, DAD! REALLY?!

          He whirls around expectantly then FREEZES, mouth agape.

          The warrior stares blankly, tilting his head in curiosity

          while cutting a menacing silhouette.

          Then, just as gradually as he rose, the warrior dips back

          beneath the clouds, disappearing.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                          (ALARMED)

           Okay.

                          (TO TOOTHLESS)

           No sudden moves.

          Suddenly, the warrior EXPLODES out of the clouds before them,

          standing atop a large dragon. They circle Hiccup and

          Toothless, forcing them to TREAD AIR.

          The warrior points a staff toward Hiccup, unnervingly, as he

          returns to face them.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 35.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Hold on, hold on.

          Toothless GROWLS a warning.

          Suddenly, they're ambushed from behind. Hiccup is plucked off

          of Toothless by another DRAGON and carried off.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Toothless!

          With the tail unmanned, Toothless PLUMMETS helplessly. He

          FLAPS wildly then CRASHES through the ice into the black,

          frigid water. FLAILING and CRYING OUT, he struggles to stay

          afloat as he watches...

          Hiccup disappear into the night sky, carried off in the

          talons of the strange dragon -- one of TENS that accompany

          the warrior in a cavalcade.

          Toothless BELLOWS in distress, desperately trying to take to

          the air. As he LEAPS and CRASHES, time and again...

          A group of SPINY DORSAL FINS split the ice, carving a path

          toward Toothless.

          Beneath the ice, a pod of SEASHOCKERS approach, two-headed,

          with Manta Ray like wings GLIDING silently in the gloom.

          Fixated on Hiccup, Toothless is caught by surprise as the

          Seashockers surface and DRAG HIM UNDER.

          Hiccup's helmet bobs to the surface, marking all that

          remains.

          EXT. ARCTIC SKY/ARCHIPELAGO - NIGHT (MIDNIGHT SUN)

          (Scene 1300 - Dragon Lady)

          Hiccup shivers in the claws of the dragon, surrounded by the

          strange flock full of breeds he's never seen. He looks back

          for Toothless, now long gone.

                          HICCUP

           HEY! YOU LEFT MY DRAGON BACK THERE!

           HE CAN'T FLY ON HIS OWN! HE'LL

           DROWN!

          The warrior offers no response, seemingly immune to the cold

          as he leads the dragon flock across the polar night -- an

          alien landscape, harsh and foreboding.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 36.

          Out of the fog looms an EPIC ICE FORMATION -- jagged, spiked,

          and similar to the icy aftermath of Eret's fort, but many

          times its size.

          The DRAGON ESCORT dives into its jagged folds.

          INT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - CONTINUOUS

          The WILD RIDE suddenly gives way to a MULTILEVEL, CAVERNOUS

          CHAMBER made of ice and columns of basalt rock. It's heavily

          populated with dragons of all kinds, looming in the shadows.

          Hiccup is dropped in the center. He scrambles to his feet,

          calling out into the darkness.

                          HICCUP

           We have to head back for my dragon!

          A HISSING dragon CLOSES IN, sniffing, leering, aggressive.

          Hiccup extends and lights his telescoping dragon blade,

          waving a swirl of fire around himself. The dragon pauses,

          intrigued, and then watches hypnotically as Hiccup pacifies

          him with calculated sweeps of the fiery blade.

          The warrior watches keenly from the shadows.

          Several aggressive dragons close in behind Hiccup. Hearing

          their hisses, he quickly stows the blade, replaces a

          cartridge in its hilt, then flips it around and sprays a

          perimeter of Zippleback gas around himself. He clicks the

          lighter, igniting a flash ring. The testy dragons recoil.

          He then reaches through the smoke, offering his open hand.

          The dragons re-approach, sniffing him with calmed curiosity.

          ON THE WARRIOR

          ... tilting his masked head, curious. He dismounts his dragon

          and approaches Hiccup.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Who are you? The Dragon Thief?

           Drago Bludvist?

          The warrior circles Hiccup in silence, taking in his gear,

          his dragon blade, his face.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Do you even understand what I'm

           saying?

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 37.

          The warrior whirls and HAMMERS his staff. In response, a

          large dragon ASCENDS from the depths, carrying...

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Toothless!

          Toothless is dumped on the ground next to Hiccup, sopping

          wet. Hiccup rushes to him, petting him reassuringly.

          Toothless coos in relief.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           It's okay. I'm glad to see you,

           too, bud. You really had me worried

           there.

          The warrior rattles his staff at a nearby dragon. In

          response, it and the surrounding dragons produce firelight

          from their throats, spotlighting Hiccup and Toothless.

          The warrior sets down his staff and shield, then approaches

          Hiccup, cautiously and animal-like.

          Toothless SNARLS and circles Hiccup defensively, but then

          instantly yields to the stranger's outstretched hand. With a

          quick, disarming gesture, the warrior lays Toothless down in

          a state of bliss. Hiccup is astounded.

          The warrior's hand continues toward Hiccup's face. He

          recoils, but the warrior persists, finding the faint scar on

          Hiccup's chin, glinting in the firelight.

          The warrior GASPS and retreats a few steps.

                          WARRIOR

           (whispered, shaken)

           Hiccup?

                          (BEAT)

           Could it be? After all these years?

           How is this possible?

          The voice is surprisingly female.

                          HICCUP

           Uh, should I... should I know you?

                          WARRIOR

           No. You were only a babe...

          The warrior slowly removes the strange mask, revealing VALKA,

          40, beneath. Her eyes meet his, equally wide-eyed and aghast.

                          VALKA

           ... but a mother never forgets.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 38.

          Hiccup stammers, tongue-tied, aghast.

                          VALKA (CONT'D)

           Come...

          EXT. ARCTIC SKY - NIGHT (MIDNIGHT SUN)

          (Sequence 1325 - Searching)

          Stoick and Gobber search over the frigid waves that lap

          against the pack ice.

                          STOICK

           Boar-headed! Just like his mother!

           She could never stay put either.

          Gobber glances over at Stoick, who's hunched over, brow

          furrowed and solemn.

                          GOBBER

           Ah, he's just twenty. And a Viking.

           I mean, could there be a worse

           combination? Ha! When I think of

           how stubborn and senseless YOU were

           back in the day... well, not much

           has changed, actually.

                          STOICK

           You know what he's like. He won't

           give up, Gobber. And if Hiccup

           finds Drago, before we find him...

                          GOBBER

           Bah! NOTHING can hurt Hiccup so

           long as that Night Fury's around.

           It's a Night Fury!

          Framed by a hole in the ice, a glistening object bobs on the

          surface below. Stoick squints and CIRCLES BACK, leading

          Skullcrusher in a DIVE toward it. Stoick SNAGS it out of the

          water. It's Hiccup's helmet.

          Gobber pulls alongside Stoick, seeing his look of dread.

          Stoick holds the helmet out for his dragon to SMELL.

                          STOICK

           Find him, Skullcrusher. Find him.

          Skullcrusher SNIFFS the helmet like a bloodhound, ROARS, and

          suddenly CHANGES HEADING.

          INT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - TUNNEL - DAWN

          (Scene 1400 - A New Family)

          CLOSE ON Hiccup, flustered, winded, chasing VALKA through

          tightly winding corridors.

                          HICCUP

           Hold on! Wait just a minute! Come

           back here!

                          VALKA

           This way. Come.

                          HICCUP

           You can't just say something like

           that and run off! You're my

           mother?! I mean, what the -- do you

           grasp how INSANE it sounds?!

                          (BEAT)

           I have questions!

                          VALKA

           Come. Quickly!

          Hiccup follows her over the difficult terrain. He tries to

          clamber over a tall rock, unsuccessfully.

                          HICCUP

           Where have you been all this time?

          Toothless boosts him over. Hiccup lands on the other side.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           What've you been doing?! They said

           you were dead! Everyone thinks you

           were eaten by...

          Hiccup trails off as he enters...

          INT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - OASIS - CONTINUOUS

          ... a stadium-sized chamber teeming with ferns, waterfalls,

          hot springs and THOUSANDS of new DRAGONS.

          Hiccup wanders in, basking in the in the amazing sight: a

          dome of sweating ice capping a geothermal micro climate,

          filled with dragons of every shape and kind.

          He spots Valka clinging to a basalt overhang, watching him.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 40.

                          HICCUP

           This is where you've been for

           twenty years?

          She nods from her perch.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           You've been rescuing them.

          She nods again, this time with a smile.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Unbelievable.

                          VALKA

           You're not upset?

                          HICCUP

           What? No. I don't know. It's a bit

           much to get my head around, to be

           frank. It's not every day you find

           out your mother is some kind of

           crazy, feral, vigilante dragon

           lady.

          Valka chuckles, and using her dragon's wing, lowers herself

          to the ground like a skilled acrobat.

                          VALKA

           At least I'm not boring... right?

                          HICCUP

           I suppose there is that...

           (feeble, trailing off)

           ... one... specific... thing...

          Excited dragons rush up to greet Hiccup and Toothless. Hiccup

          pets a few, marveling at the vast dragon utopia before him.

                          VALKA

           Do you like it?

                          HICCUP

           I don't have the words.

          Toothless SNARLS in annoyance as the curious, smothering

          dragons SNIFF every part of him.

                          VALKA

           Can I... ? He's beautiful!

          She reaches out to stroke Toothless, who PURRS at her touch.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 41.

                          VALKA (CONT'D)

           Incredible. He might very well be

           the last of his kind.

          She inspects his talons as Toothless rolls onto his back,

          nuzzling her.

                          VALKA (CONT'D)

           And look, he's your age! No wonder

           you get along so well.

          Hiccup smiles, astounded by Toothless' affection for Valka.

          She checks his teeth. They recede into the gums at her touch.

                          VALKA (CONT'D)

           And retractable teeth? Ah!

           How did you manage to--

                          HICCUP

           --I found him in the woods. He was

           shot down and wounded.

          She winces and offers a sympathetic nod as she stands to

          caress a few of her own rescued dragons.

                          VALKA

           This Snafflefang lost his leg to

           one of Drago Bludvist's iron traps.

           This Raincutter had her wing sliced

           by razor netting. And this poor

           Hobblegrunt was blinded by a tree

           snare... then left to die alone and

           scared.

           (re: Toothless' tail)

           And what of this? Did Drago or his

           trappers do this, too?

                          HICCUP

           Heh. Well, crazy thing is... I'm

           actually the one who shot him down.

          She glares, confused.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           It's okay though. He got me back.

           (playfully, to Toothless)

           Right, bud? You couldn't save all

           of me, could you? You just had to

           make it even. So... peg leg!

          Hiccup rattles his prosthetic leg with a smirk. Valka

          observes their playful rapport with curiosity.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 42.

                          VALKA

           What did your father think of your

           Night Fury friend?

                          HICCUP

           He didn't take it all that well.

          She mutters in agreement.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           But then... he changed. They all

           did. Pretty soon everyone back home

           had dragons of their own.

          She smiles at Toothless, dismissive.

                          VALKA

           If only it were possible.

                          HICCUP

           No, really, I --

                          VALKA

           -- Believe me, I tried, as well.

           But people are not capable of

           change, Hiccup. Some of us... were

           just born different.

          EXT. BERK VILLAGE - NIGHT

                         FLASHBACK

          Dragons sweep from the sky, blowing FIRE, carrying off sheep

          and dried fish. Vikings chase them down, hurling weapons.

           VALKA (V.O.)

           Berk was a land of kill or be

           killed, but I believed peace was

           possible.

          A Viking is about to finish off a felled dragon, but Valka

          chases up to him and tugs at his arm.

                          VALKA

           Stop! You'll only make it worse!

          The dragon takes wing, escaping to safety... leaving the

          Viking warrior glaring at Valka.

           VALKA (V.O.)

           It was a very unpopular opinion.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 43.

          As he rushes off, Valka hears a clatter and whirls around to

          see a DRAGON (Cloudjumper) clawing its way through the roof

          of a house.

                          VALKA

           Hiccup!

          INT. STOICK'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

                         FLASHBACK CONTINUED

          Cloudjumper enters the house through the hole in the roof,

          sniffing out a baby's cradle in the corner.

          Valka rushes in, panicked.

           VALKA (V.O.)

           One night, a dragon broke into our

           house, finding you in the cradle.

          Valka draws a sword quietly, slipping up to the dragon, only

          to find it huddled protectively over the cradle as BABY

          HICCUP innocently plays with one of its talons.

           VALKA (V.O.)

           I rushed to protect you, but what I

           saw... was proof of everything I

           believed.

          Valka's careful approach causes a floorboard to squeak.

          Spooked, Cloudjumper whips around to face her, accidentally

          SCRATCHING baby Hiccup's chin.

          Their eyes meet. Valka lowers her sword, transfixed.

           VALKA (V.O.)

           This wasn't a vicious beast, but an

           intelligent, gentle creature, whose

           soul reflected my own.

          Stoick's AXE spins through the air between them, barely

          missing Cloudjumper and planting into a pillar.

                          STOICK

           Valka, run!

          Alarmed, Cloudjumper WHIRLS around at Stoick and BLASTS!

          Stoick DIVES out of the way as the FIRE SPLATTERS against the

          wall, burning a hole and setting the room ablaze.

          The dragon moves toward Stoick, but Valka grabs hold.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 44.

                          VALKA

           Don't!

          It turns to face her again, locking eyes, agitated.

                          STOICK

           Hold on!

          Stoick dashes through the fire toward Hiccup and pulls him

          out of the cradle. He pulls his axe from the pillar...

           VALKA (O.S.)

           No! Stoick!

          ... but in a WHOOSH of smoke and embers, the dragon and Valka

          are GONE.

                          STOICK

           VALKA!

                          VALKA

                          (DISTANT)

           Stoick!

          Stoick and baby Hiccup watch helplessly as the dragon spirits

          Valka away into the night sky.

                          STOICK

           Valka...

          ON BABY HICCUP'S FACE, with the fresh nick on his chin...

           MATCH CUT TO:

          INT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - DAWN

                         PRESENT DAY

          HICCUP'S FACE, with the matching scar.

                          VALKA

           You and your father nearly died

           that night, all because I couldn't

           kill a dragon.

                          HICCUP

           Yeah, it runs in the family.

                          VALKA

           It broke my heart to stay away, but

           I believed you'd be safer if I did.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 45.

          Hiccup considers this, then raises his eyes to hers, seeing

          the sting of remorse.

                          HICCUP

           How did you survive?

                          VALKA

           Oh, Cloudjumper never meant to harm

           me. He must've thought I belonged

           here...

          She leads him to the edge of raised natural terrace,

          overlooking the steamy oasis with its flowing hot spring

          waterfalls. Half-submerged in the warm lake below, a massive

          white dragon with pronounced, mammoth-like tusks rests

          benevolently on the banks, his stately countenance like that

          of a lion surrounded by his pride.

                          VALKA (CONT'D)

           In the home of the great

           Bewilderbeast. The alpha species.

           One of very few that still exist.

                          (BEAT)

           Every nest has its queen, but this

           is king of all dragons.

          Dragons land and bow reverentially to the Bewilderbeast.

          Valka gestures to the spiked ice ceiling that acts as a

          sweating greenhouse.

                          VALKA (CONT'D)

           With his icy breath, this graceful

           giant built our nest. A safe haven

           for dragons everywhere.

          On HICCUP, putting it together.

                          HICCUP

           Wait, that's the ice-spitter? He's

           responsible for all that

           destruction?

                          VALKA

           He protects us. We all live under

           his care. And his command.

          They pass an eggshell-littered NURSERY. HATCHLINGS dart out

          of it, greeting them excitedly and inciting chaos. Toothless

          is overwhelmed by their manic picking and scratching.

          Cloudjumper balks and sends them scattering.

                          VALKA (CONT'D)

           All but the babies, of course...

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 46.

          The hatchlings clamber on top of the Bewilderbeast and play

          on his massive tusks, despite his authority. Valka laughs.

                          VALKA (CONT'D)

           ... who listen to no one.

          The Bewilderbeast lets out a frosty SNORT, sending off the

          youngsters to spread more mischief.

          Now awakened, The Bewilderbeast raises his gargantuan head to

          take a closer look at Hiccup, coming eye to massive eye.

          Valka bows in his presence. As does Toothless.

                          VALKA (CONT'D)

           I've lived among them for twenty

           years, Hiccup, learning their ways,

           discovering their secrets...

          He acknowledges Hiccup with another icy snort, slicking back

          Hiccup's hair in a frosty veneer. Valka laughs.

                          VALKA (CONT'D)

           He likes you.

                          HICCUP

           Wow.

          She chuckles, delighting in his awe.

                          VALKA

           You must be hungry.

                          HICCUP

           Uh, yeah. I could eat.

                          VALKA

           Good. It's feeding time.

          Toothless tucks himself beneath Cloudjumper's wing, trying to

          befriend him, but Cloudjumper isn't having any of it. He

          grimaces and follows Valka out.

          EXT. OPEN SEA - NIGHT

          (Scene 1200 - Astrid Takes Charge)

          Astrid and Stormfly circle a lone iceberg, being used as a

          rest stop for the Gang and their dragons. She lands with a

          frown, eyeing the distance.

                          ASTRID

           I don't like it. They should've

           been back with Hiccup by now.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 47.

                          RUFFNUT

           I don't like it either. Eret son of

           Eret was the man of my dreams. My

           everything!

                          SNOTLOUT

           But, baby, I grew facial hair for

           you.

          Fishlegs strokes his peach fuzz beard, meek and dejected.

                          FISHLEGS

           Me, too.

                          ASTRID

           What if Drago shot them down? What

           if they need our help?

                          (RESOLUTE)

           We have to find them.

                          FISHLEGS

                          (NERVOUSLY)

           What? But Stoick said...

                          ASTRID

           It doesn't matter what he said, if

           they've all been captured. Come on!

          She flies off, determined.

          EXT. ICE FLOES - NIGHT

          Eret's ship is beset by ice floes. The crew stirs on deck as

          he paces, grumbling, while nursing his head with a large

          chunk of ice.

                          NO-NAME

           Do we go back?

                          ERET

           We've nowhere to go! Nothing to

           sell! And no heads to call our own,

           if we don't turn up with dragons

           and fast --

          He's suddenly scooped up in Stormfly's talons.

                          ASTRID

           Careful what you wish for!

           UG (O.S.)

           ERET SON OF ERET!

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 48.

          Nets whiz past as Astrid and the Gang rocket out of range.

                          ERET

           What is this?!

                          ASTRID

           A kidnapping.

          Ruffnut grabs his leg, clutching him possessively.

                          RUFFNUT

           Yay! Can he ride with me? Can he?

           Can he?

          Both Eret and Tuffnut groan in protest.

                          ASTRID

           You're gonna show us the way to

           Drago.

                          ERET

           And help dragon riders sneak into

           Drago's camp? Just kill me now.

                          ASTRID

           That can be arranged. Stormfly,

           drop it.

          In enthusiastic response, Stormfly pops open her talons,

          sending Eret plummeting. He wails and flails as he hurtles

          toward the ice far below.

                          ASTRID (CONT'D)

           Good girl! Stormfly, fetch.

          She dives after him, just as enthusiastically.

          ON ERET, terrified, as the ground rushes up at him.

                          ERET

           ALL RIGHT! OKAY! I'LL TAKE YOU TO

           DRAGO!

          Stormfly suddenly SNATCHES him out of his free-fall just

          before hitting the ice. Astrid giggles and cracks her

          knuckles.

                          ASTRID

           Works every time.

          EXT. SKY - EARLY MORNING

          (Scene 1600 - Momma's Boy)

                         BEGIN MONTAGE

          Hiccup and Toothless follow Valka and Cloudjumper over a

          majestic fjord in the long rays of the low Arctic sun.

          Hiccup peers over his shoulder to see that a thick flock of

          dragons -- nearly all of Valka's rescues -- are close on

          their tail. He turns back to his mother, confused.

                          HICCUP

           Hey, I thought we were going to

           eat?

                          VALKA

           (with a mischievous grin)

           Oh, we are.

          She directs his gaze below, where in the choppy water of the

          fjord, a group of Seashocker dragons are corralling a dense

          shoal of fish near the surface.

          Suddenly, the Bewilderbeast rises from deep below, scooping

          the fish up in its vast mouth as its tusks break the surface.

          It breaches just below Hiccup and Toothless, giving them a

          fright before spitting the fish into the air and crashing

          back down into the sea.

          Valka laughs at Hiccup's surprise as the hungry dragons race

          for the flailing fish, scooping them out of the air. Hiccup

          gestures to Toothless to join in and he gladly scoops up a

          mouth full.

          EXT. SNOWY SHORELINE - LATER

          MONTAGE CONTINUES...

          Hiccup has his map spread out in the snow, explaining the

          various lands he's discovered during his explorations.

                          HICCUP

           And from Dragon Island, I found

           this archipelago...

          He looks up to see that Valka is no longer next to him, but

          she has sketched out the rest of the northern land masses in

          the snow, wowing Hiccup with just how far and wide she has

          explored.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 50.

          She returned to Hiccup's side with a smile. But his amazement

          is interrupted by Toothless joining in, drawing all over

          Valka's map with a giant icicle.

          Hiccup simply shrugs as his mother giggles, and Cloudjumper

          sneers.

          EXT. WINDSWEPT CLIFF - LATER

          Valka and Hiccup rise on their dragons, carried skyward by a

          strong coastal wind that thrusts vertical up shoreline cliff.

          One by one, dragons leap from the cliff and catch the strong

          updraft, popping their wings open like kites. They ride the

          wind and orbit around each other in a colorful, mesmeric

          dance. It's clearly a form of dragon play.

          Hiccup, lifted off of his saddle by the force of the wind,

          laughs giddily as he watches Valka walk across Cloudjumper's

          wing and onto several others, dragon-hopping from one to

          another, until she gracefully crosses Toothless from wing tip

          to wing tip. She then drops out of sight, reappearing a

          moment later standing atop Cloudjumper. Hiccup is in utter

          awe of her.

          Valka breathes in the frigid air. Lets it out blissfully.

                          VALKA

           When I'm up here, I don't even feel

           the cold. I just feel...

                          HICCUP

           Free.

          She smiles at Hiccup. He gleams back.

                          VALKA

           This is what it is to be a dragon,

           Hiccup.

          Hiccup LOCKS the pedals in the flared tail position and

          unbuckles himself. Valka watches, curious.

                          HICCUP

           It's all well and good to call

           yourself a dragon.

          Hiccup RUNS OFF of Toothless, pulling his stowed wings.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           But can you fly?

          They catch the air, SNAPPING OPEN... and sending him GLIDING.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 51.

          Valka GASPS, astonished. She flies her dragon alongside him,

          marvelling, as...

          ... Hiccup SOARS, riding the wild air currents like an eagle,

          the image of freedom. Toothless descends steadily with him,

          hovering protectively.

          Hiccup grins, pleased at having impressed Valka... until he

          realizes that he is once again racing toward a collision with

          a fast approaching mountain top.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Oh no. Toothless!

          But, with his tail locked, Toothless can't make the tight

          jackknife turn skyward to rescue Hiccup.

          Realizing that they're in trouble, Valka and Cloudjumper pour

          on the speed. All four of them collide just as they reach the

          mountain top, sending them crash-landing in an explosion of

          snow.

          They all TOPPLE head over tail to a messy landing on the wind-

          swept ridge and pop up LAUGHING.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Man! Almost! We just about had it

           that time!

          Toothless raises his snow-packed face, glowering. He tail-

          swipes Hiccup off of his feet and back into the powder.

          Valka inspects Hiccup's wing suit with utter fascination.

                          VALKA

           Incredible.

                          HICCUP

           Well, not bad yourself.

          She caresses his cheek, staring deep into his eyes. Hiccup

          doesn't recoil this time.

                          VALKA

           All this time, you took after me.

           And where was I?

                          (REMORSEFUL)

           I'm so sorry, Hiccup. Can we start

           over? Will you give me another

           chance?

          Hiccup smiles, a simple acknowledgement that all is forgiven.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 52.

                          VALKA (CONT'D)

           I can teach you all I've learned,

           these past twenty years. Like...

          Valka finds a spot at the top of Toothless' neck and rubs in

          a circular pattern. In response, his dorsal blades slowly

          crack, split and extend, forming a pronounced, aerodynamic

          `V' down the length of his back and tail.

                          VALKA (CONT'D)

           Now you can make those tight turns.

          Toothless shudders, as if experiencing a much-needed

          chiropractic adjustment. He bounds over to Hiccup, giddily

          retracting and splaying his dorsal blades like a kid with a

          new toy.

                          HICCUP

           Did YOU know about this?

          Valka smiles, delighting in their mutual amazement.

                          VALKA

           Every dragon has its secrets.

          Toothless pounces around, showing off to Cloudjumper, who

          seems thoroughly unimpressed.

                          VALKA (CONT'D)

           And I'll show them all to you.

           We'll unlock every mystery, find

           every last species, together, as

           mother and son.

                          (BEAT)

           This gift we share, Hiccup... it

           bonds us. This is who you are, son.

           Who we are. We will change the

           world for all dragons! We will make

           it a better, safer place!

                          HICCUP

           That sounds... amazing.

          She pulls him into a hug -- forceful, bursting with emotion.

          Hiccup hugs Valka back. They share a cathartic moment, before

          Hiccup peels away from her.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           This is so great! Now you and I can

           go talk to Drago -- together!

          She chuckles, incredulous.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 53.

                          VALKA

           What? There's no talking to Drago.

                          HICCUP

           But we have to --

                          VALKA

           -- No. We must protect our own.

          Hiccup stares, exasperated by the familiar line. Cloudjumper

          lumbers over, eager to be rid of Toothless' puppy-like

          energy. Valka pets him.

                          VALKA (CONT'D)

           Now come on, we should be getting

           back.

          Before Hiccup can say anymore, he hear heavy breathing next

          to him, and looks over to see Toothless with a gaping grin,

          clapping his dorsal blades.

          EXT. ICE CAVE - DAY

          (Scene 1350 - Meet Drago)

          Astrid and the gang stealthily approach a cluster of tabular

          icebergs, collapsed against each other at the mouth of a

          maze. Stormfly drops Eret to the snow, but before he can

          flee, she lands atop him and nests like a hen with her egg.

                          ERET

           Agghh! Okay! I got you here, now

           get this thing off me!

                          ASTRID

           Never take a toy from a dragon.

           Don't you know anything?

          Stormfly crushes him in place under her weight.

                          ERET

                          (STRAINED)

           Gah! Why does this keep happening

           to me?

          Astrid crawls up the rising ridge to reveal...

          A MASSIVE FLOTILLA, moored together like a floating camp in

          the deep water between collided icebergs.

          Thick chains run deep into the water, where great blasts of

          bubbles erupt on the surface. The unseen creature rocks the

          ships. Its effect alone describes it as gargantuan.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 54.

                          ASTRID

           What's down there?

          Fishlegs rifles through his note cards contained in his belt

          pouch.

                          FISHLEGS

           Large diameter bubbles, massive

           lungs, cold water deep dweller, I'm

           thinking class five leviathan,

           maybe six.

          Suddenly, Stormfly is alerted to an encroaching menace and

          takes wing. BLOW DARTS whiz through the air, hitting the

          other dragons. The effect is immediate -- they fall to the

          ground, unconscious. Drugged.

                          HICCUP

           Meatlug! What's wrong, girl?

          Eret spring to his feet and draws his blades. Astrid and the

          Gang find themselves surrounded by soldiers, camouflaged in

          polar bear furs, and poised to fire darts. They're

          outnumbered. Fishlegs raises his hands, dropping the cards.

          EXT. DRAGO'S SHIP - DECK - MOMENTS LATER

          DRAGO BLUDVIST, a hulking figure draped in a dragon skin

          cloak, crouches over the prow of the fleet's grisly flagship,

          adorned in massive dragon bones and skulls. His scarred face

          is masked by thick, grizzled dreadlocks.

           ERET (O.S.)

           DRAGO!

          Drago turns to see Astrid, Eret, and the Gang being forcibly

          escorted onto the deck. Eret SHAKES HIMSELF FREE.

                          ERET (CONT'D)

           Get off me!

          In the background, a sledge, loaded with Hookfang, Meatlug,

          Belch and Barf -- all unconscious -- is dragged onto the deck

          by armored dragons.

                          ERET (CONT'D)

           Always great to see you, my friend!

           Keeping warm up here?

          The soldiers disarm him, pushing him forward as Drago

          approaches.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 55.

                          ERET (CONT'D)

           Well, as you can see, I'm right on

           time with a new batch of dragons,

           just like I promised.

          Hookfang awakens, groggily shaking off the effect of the blow-

          dart. He rears as soldiers struggle to reign him in.

                          SOLDIER #1

           Watch out! He's waking up! Keep him

           steady!

                          SOLDIER #2

           Give me some backup here!

                          DRAGO

           Drop the ropes.

          They do so. Hookfang bucks and roars, chasing off the

          soldiers, then focusing on Drago as he closes in. The armored

          dragons avert their eyes and cower as Drago passes.

          Hookfang HISSES a warning, but Drago approaches, undaunted.

          Hookfang BLASTS. In a blur, Drago wraps himself in his dragon

          skin cloak. The sticky, napalm-like fire splatters against

          the fireproof scales, enveloping Drago in dripping flames as

          he persists forward without missing a step.

          As the blast ends, Drago drops the cloak, closing in and

          holding a cold stare. Hookfang lets out a ferocious ROAR.

          Drago YELLS back with a fierce, savage scream, interrupting

          Hookfang and causing him to recoil. Drago whirls his bull-

          hook overhead and STABS it into the deck planks.

          Hookfang stirs, his aggression fading in the face of Drago's

          unflinching show of dominance.

          After a moment, Hookfang averts his eyes and lowers his head

          in submission. Drago places his boot upon Hookfang's snout,

          pressing it into the deck planks.

                          SNOTLOUT

           Hookfang!

                          RUFFNUT

           Hey!

                          ASTRID

           What are you doing?

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 56.

                          DRAGO

           (quiet, to the dragon)

           You belong to me now.

                          ERET

           And as an added bonus, I also

           caught you their riders. No extra

           charge.

          Drago notices the saddle on Hookfang's back. His eyes wander

          to the saddle on Meatlug. Alarm flashes in Drago's eyes.

                          ASTRID

           What?! Are you kidding me?!

                          RUFFNUT

           But you were so perfect!

                          ERET

           Turns out, there's a whole bunch of

           them out there. They --

          In a flash, Drago stops toward Eret and seizes him by the

          throat.

                          DRAGO

           How many?

          As Eret chokes, stammering, Astrid whispers to the gang.

                          ASTRID

           Drago doesn't have them after all.

                          DRAGO

           HOW MANY?!

                          ASTRID

           Hundreds! A whole island full!

          His grip tightens around Eret's neck as he turns to Astrid.

                          ERET

           I wouldn't worry about it. My men

           are hunting them down as we speak.

           They won't know where you're

           hiding. I promise you that.

          Astrid nods a covert signal to the Gang -- she has a plan.

                          ASTRID

           Oh, yes they will!

          Drago drops Eret as Astrid advances, staring Drago down. Eret

          tries to signal her to stop, but it's no use.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 57.

                          ASTRID (CONT'D)

           They know we're missing and they

           have tracking dragons. If you so

           much as touch us, Hiccup is gonna

                          KICK --

                          DRAGO

           -- Hiccup?

                          ERET

           He's not a problem. Really. Trust

           me.

                          ASTRID

           He's only the son of Stoick the

           Vast...

          Drago's eyes narrow upon hearing Stoick's name.

                          ASTRID (CONT'D)

           ... his heir to the throne of

           Berk... and the greatest dragon

           master this world has ever seen!

                          DRAGO

           Dragon master? I ALONE control the

           dragons!

                          TUFFNUT

           Nope.

                          FISHLEGS

           Sorry!

                          ASTRID

           And unless you let us go, right

           now, he will blast through here on

           his Night Fury and blow your entire

           fleet of ships to splinters!

          Eret slips away, trying to distance himself from the tension.

                          RUFFNUT

           Then they'll be crying like babies!

                          SNOTLOUT

           Funny and beautiful.

                          FISHLEGS

           Good one, babe!

          Ruffnut groans, exasperated by their smarmy advances.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 58.

                          TUFFNUT

           Yeah. Like babies. They always cry.

           Real tiny ones...

          Drago grabs Eret by the face and bears down on him.

                          DRAGO

           First there was one rider. And now

           all of Berk.

                          (TO ERET)

           And YOU led them to me.

          He THROWS Eret across the deck.

                          ERET

           Drago!

                          DRAGO

           CEASE ALL PREPARATIONS! WE MUST

           ATTACK THE DRAGONS RIDER'S NEST AT

           ONCE!

                          (SAVORING IT)

           WE WILL TAKE DOWN THEIR ALPHA...

           AND THEN WE WILL TAKE BERK!

          Soldiers CHEER in the thousands.

                          ERET

           You're overreacting!

                          DRAGO

           And get rid of him.

                          ERET

           Drago, please...

          The soldiers HURL throwing knives at Eret...

          But Stormfly lands in a blur of wings, shielding Eret from

          the flurry of blades. She whips her tail, throwing spikes in

          all directions.

                          ASTRID

           STORMFLY!

          Stormfly ROARS protectively, hiding Eret within her wings,

          until a well-blown dart sinks into her neck, bringing her

          down...

                          ASTRID (CONT'D)

           NO!

          Revealing Eret, gawking in shock.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 59.

          INT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - OASIS - MORNING

          (Scene 1800 - Family Reunion)

          Hiccup reattaches his flight suit while standing on a ledge

          overlooking the utopian nest, teeming with dragons. Several

          babies race in to hassle Toothless as he naps.

                          HICCUP

                          (DETERMINED)

           Well, bud, we can't wait around for

           Drago to attack this place. We've

           gotta find him first. Let's go.

          Suddenly, a thick hand clamps down over Hiccup's face --

          muffling his scream!

          Toothless whirls around to find STOICK, towering over Hiccup.

          He calms Toothless with a touch and releases Hiccup.

                          STOICK

           Easy now.

                          HICCUP

           Are you kidding me? How'd you get

           in here?

                          STOICK

           The same way we're getting you out.

                          HICCUP

           We?

          Gobber appears in the arch of a tunnel.

                          GOBBER

           All clear!

                          STOICK

           Toothless. Come.

          They hurry back into the winding corridor.

                          HICCUP

           Dad! There's something you need to

           know!

                          STOICK

           Yeah, yeah, tell me on the way.

                          HICCUP

           This isn't an on-the-way kind of

           update, actually...

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 60.

                          STOICK

           I've heard ENOUGH, Hiccup.

                          HICCUP

           ... more of the earth-shattering

           development variety.

                          STOICK

           Yeah, just add it to the pile.

                          HICCUP

           Dad, unlike most surprises I spring

           on you, this is one you'll like. I

           promise! You just have to handle it

           delicately, so...

          They round a tight bend in the corridor to find Gobber

          staring blankly at something unseen in the next chamber. He

          shuffles past Stoick and Hiccup, dazed.

                          GOBBER

           Uh, you might want to take this

           one. Oh, boy.

          Stoick draws his SWORD, then braves into the chamber ahead.

                          HICCUP

           Dad, can you put the sword away...

           please?

          Stoick GASPS as if seeing a ghost... and drops his sword with

          a clatter.

          Valka stands some twenty paces ahead of him, blocking the

          path. She lets out an audible SHUDDER upon seeing him.

          He removes his helmet slowly as Hiccup, Gobber, and Toothless

          appear at Stoick's side.

                          VALKA

                          (RATTLED)

           I know what you're going to say,

           Stoick. How could I have done this?

           Stayed away all of these years. And

           why didn't I come back to you? To

           our son.

          Stoick steps towards her, wide-eyed and speechless. Dragons

          emerge from the recesses behind Valka, hissing protectively.

                          VALKA (CONT'D)

           Well, what sign did I have that you

           could change, Stoick? That anyone

           on Berk could?

                          (MORE)

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 61.

                          VALKA (CONT'D)

           I pleaded so many times to stop the

           fighting, to find another answer,

           but did any of you listen?

                          GOBBER

           This is why I never married.

                          (BEAT)

           This and one other reason.

          Stoick continues to close the gap, mesmerized. With every

          step, Valka becomes increasingly flustered. She backs into an

          ice wall, with nowhere to go, and Stoick just a few paces

          away.

                          VALKA

                          (TEARFUL)

           I know that I left you to raise

           Hiccup alone... but I thought he'd

           be better off without me. And I was

           wrong, I see that now, but...

          Stoick gently reaches a hand toward her face.

                          VALKA (CONT'D)

           Oh stop being so stoic, Stoick. Go

           on... SHOUT, SCREAM, SAY SOMETHING!

                          STOICK

           You're as beautiful as the day I

           lost you.

          His words snuff her retort, rendering her speechless. She

          softens despite herself, yielding her cheek to his palm. He

          caresses her skin as a reluctant tear runs through his

          fingers. He PULLS her into a KISS. She resists briefly, then

          gives in. The surrounding dragons softly RETREAT in kind.

          Hiccup gapes, warmed by the sight of his parents reunited.

          EXT. ICE CHANNEL - DAY

          (Scene 1750 - Eret's Turn)

          Drago's massive flagship leads the flotilla, pulled along

          forcefully by whatever's at the other end of the enormous

          chain.

          Drago WHACKS the chain with his bullhook, spurring it

          forward.

          ON DRAGO'S SHIP

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 62.

          Eret, Astrid, and the Gang are escorted to the stern,

          surrounded by several of Drago's soldiers. Wrists bound.

          Spear tips pressed into their backs.

                          SNOTLOUT

           Could this day get any worse?

                          TUFFNUT

           Uh, let me see. You'll jump into

           freezing cold water and then die

           from drowning.

          They reach the gang plank. Eret peers overboard at the deep,

          icy water below.

                          ERET

           Looks refreshing.

          He turns to Astrid, meeting her glare with mock chivalry.

                          ERET (CONT'D)

           Please, ladies first.

          A pair of soldiers GRAB Astrid by the arms.

                          ASTRID

           You are a steaming heap of dragon --

                          ERET

           -- Duck.

          Eret WHIRLS around, ROUND-HOUSING both soldiers. They GO

          DOWN, heavily.

          He catches one of their spears with his bound hands and

          slices his ropes free. They fall away as he catches the other

          spear, twirling both in invitation.

                          SOLDIER

           Warn the others!

          One soldier runs to send up the alarm... while the last two

          raise BLOW DART TUBES.

          Eret SWIPES the first off of his legs, sending the dart into

          the neck of the second.

                          RUFFNUT

           Get `em, you son of an Eret!

          As the downed soldiers SCRAMBLE to their feet, Fishlegs FALLS

          OVER, CRUSHING them under his weight.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 63.

          Eret CATCHES the falling tube from the second soldier and

          BLOWS the dart at the fleeing third. The soldier DROPS,

          unconscious -- just shy of the Captain's Quarters.

                          RUFFNUT (CONT'D)

           Okay, I love you again.

          Ruffnut skips past Snotlout on her way to Eret. Snotlout

          watches, crestfallen.

                          TUFFNUT

           Ugh. Pathetic. You can still jump.

          Eret avoids Ruffnut and turns to Astrid.

                          ERET

           So? Are we going to save your

           dragons and get out of here or not?

          Astrid narrows her eyes, not knowing what to make of him. He

          reclaims his sword and dagger from the unconscious soldier

          who took them and cuts Tuffnut free.

                          ERET (CONT'D)

           Check every trap. They're here

           somewhere.

          EXT. DRAGO'S SHIP - MOMENTS LATER

          Astrid slips under a tarp and cranks open a metal trap. She

          peers between its massive iron teeth, discovering Meatlug

          within, bound and chained to its base as bait.

                          ASTRID

           Meatlug?

                         ON ERET

          Carefully cranking another trap, wincing at the sound. The

          iron jaws of the trap open wider with every CLICK.

                          ERET

           Anyone coming?

          Ruffnut "stands guard," fixated on Eret's rippling biceps.

                          RUFFNUT

           I don't know. You just keep doing

           what you're doing. Keep crankin'...

          Eret squeezes between the cocked teeth, finding Stormfly

          within, muzzled and chained. She looks up at Eret, calming

          immediately. He pauses, then approaches slowly.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 64.

          Eret carefully reaches out and strokes Stormfly's muzzle.

                          ERET

           Thank you for saving my life.

                          (BEAT)

           Now let me return the favor.

          INT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - VALKA'S LIVING QUARTERS - LATE

                         AFTERNOON

          (Scene 1850 - The Last Dance)

          As Toothless and Cloudjumper hover for scraps, Stoick and

          Valka prepare skewers of fish. She's overwhelmed, lost in her

          thoughts, and covering it up poorly.

                          HICCUP

           Mom, you'd never recognize it!

           Where we used to make weapons, we

           now build saddles, wing slings --

           we even fix dragon teeth! You

           wouldn't believe how much

           everything's changed!

          Valka offers a skittish half-smile and hands him a plate.

                          STOICK

           Our son's changed Berk for the

           better. I think we did well with

           this one, Val.

                          HICCUP

           Thanks, Dad.

          Stoick places his hands on Valka's shoulders. She flinches,

          dropping the plate.

          Cloudjumper steals the fish before Toothless can get to it.

          Toothless whimpers, and as a sign of acceptance, Cloudjumper

          regurgitates the fish so Toothless can have some.

                          VALKA

           I'm... a little out of practice.

                          STOICK

                          (SWEETLY)

           Well, y'know... I didn't marry you

           for your cooking.

                          GOBBER

           (to Hiccup and Grump)

           I hope not. Her meatballs could

           kill more beasts than a battle axe.

                          GOBBER (CONT'D)

           I've still got a few knocking

           around in here. Ha ha!

          Gobber takes a bite, gags, and dump the entire plate of fish

          skewers into Grump's mouth like a trash can.

                          HICCUP

           And once you move back in, with all

           of your dragons, Drago won't even

           stand a chance. Everything will be

           okay!

          Stoick can see that Valka is overwhelmed. He lays a hand upon

          Hiccup's shoulder, calming him.

                          STOICK

           Slow down, son. It's a lot to take

           in.

                          HICCUP

           Oh. Gotcha.

          Valka crosses the room to fill a flask with water, back

          turned to the group, as Stoick eyes her sympathetically. He

          decides on a different approach... and whistles a familiar

          tune.

          ON VALKA, as her eyes widen, stirred, recognizing the melody.

          She turns away from Stoick, as the water overflows from the

          flask.

                          GOBBER

           Oh, I love this one!

          Stoick approaches her delicately.

                          STOICK

                          (WHISPERED)

           Remember our song, Val?

          Hiccup watches him, curious, as Stoick FUMBLES THROUGH THE

          FIRST VERSE of an old Viking courting song:

                          STOICK (CONT'D)

                          (SINGING SOFTLY)

           I'll swim and sail on savage seas,

           with ne'er a fear of drowning. And

           gladly ride the waves of life, if

           you will marry me.

          Valka avoids his gaze, wallowing in a mess of emotions.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 66.

                          STOICK (CONT'D)

                          (SINGING)

           No scorching sun, nor freezing cold

                          WILL --

                          GOBBER

                          (SINGING)

           -- will stop me on my journey!

           (catching himself,

                          EMBARRASSED)

           Sorry.

          Stoick scowls at him, then returns his attention to Valka.

                          STOICK

                          (SINGING)

           If you will promise me your

           heart...

          Stoick pauses, setting Valka up for her part of the duet.

                          STOICK (CONT'D)

           And love...

          Stoick hangs eagerly, awaiting her words, but Valka closes

          her eyes, rejecting his invitation. He lets out a heavy-

          hearted sigh. But nostalgia gets the better of Valka. She

          softly SINGS HER PART:

                          VALKA

                          (SINGING)

           And love me for eternity.

          Stoick beams. She brushes past him, setting into the center

          of the chamber and holding her forearm aloft in invitation.

          Stoick crosses his forearm against hers, initiating a

          beautiful dance to accompany the song.

                          VALKA (CONT'D)

                          (SINGING)

           My dearest one, my darling dear,

           you mighty words astound me. But

           I've no need of mighty deeds, when

           I feel your arms around me.

          The dance is full of charming missteps as Stoick and Valka

          recreate a moment from their past, before Hiccup's wonder-

          struck eyes.

                          STOICK

                          (SINGING)

           But I would bring you rings of

           gold. I'd even sing you poetry.

                          (MORE)

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 67.

                          STOICK (CONT'D)

           And I would keep you from all harm,

           if you'd stay here beside me.

                          VALKA

                          (SINGING)

           I have no use for rings of gold. I

           care not for your poetry. I only

           want your hand to hold. I only want

           you near me.

          Gobber can't help himself. He drags Hiccup onto his feet so

          that he can join in the dancing, too.

                          GOBBER

           C'mon, Hiccup!

           VALKA, STOICK, & GOBBER

                          (SINGING)

           To love and kiss, to sweetly hold.

           For the dancing and the dreaming.

           Through all life's sorrows and

           delights, I'll keep your love

           inside me.

          Hiccup is amazed by the sight of his giddy parents, spinning

          and laughing in each others' arms, reunited.

           VALKA, STOICK, & GOBBER (CONT'D)

                          (SINGING)

           I'll swim and sail through savage

           seas, with ne'er a fear of

           drowning. And gladly ride the waves

           of life, if you will marry me!

          Gobber carries the last note...

                          GOBBER

                          (SINGING)

           I'm still going...

          Hiccup taps him.

                          HICCUP

           Gobber!

                          GOBBER

           I'm done.

          Valka and Stoick slow to a stop, WINDED and LAUGHING.

                          STOICK

           Ah... I thought I'd have to die

           before we'd have that dance again.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 68.

                          VALKA

           No need for drastic measures.

                          STOICK

           For you, my dear... anything.

          She smiles sweetly. Stoick's eyes well with tears. He goes

          down on one knee, proposing to her anew.

                          STOICK (CONT'D)

           Will you come home, Val? Will you

           be my wife once again?

          Toothless nudges Valka closer to Stoick. They laugh as Hiccup

          joins them. Stoick throws his arm around him.

                          STOICK (CONT'D)

           We can be a family! What do you

           say?

          Valka, between tears and laughter, turns to Hiccup.

                          VALKA

           Yes!

          Gobber pops his head in.

                          GOBBER

           Great! I'll do the cooking!

          They laugh.

                          STOICK

           Thank Odin you didn't listen to me,

           son. We never would have found each

           other.

          Suddenly, Toothless and Cloudjumper suddenly perk up, sensing

          something unheard. Hiccup notices.

                          HICCUP

           Toothless?

          Dragons SWARM past Valka's chamber, racing toward some

          unknown disturbance.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           What's happening?

          They're answered by subsequent HEAVY BOOMS that reverberate

          through the fortress.

          EXT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - MOMENTS LATER

          (Scene 1900 - Surprise Guests)

          Valka rushes out to find...

          DRAGO'S ARMADA in the lagoon below and his forces of

          thousands now landed upon the beach.

          They launch catapults and ballistas into the icy spires,

          gaining entrance into the mountain's tunnels.

          Hiccup, Stoick, and Gobber catch up to Valka.

                          HICCUP

           Oh, no...

          Valka tries to hurry off, fuming. Stoick stops her.

                          STOICK

           Val! It's all right, it's all

           right. We're a team now.

                          (BEAT)

           Now what do you want to do?

          She glances from Hiccup to Stoick.

                          VALKA

           We have to save the dragons.

                          STOICK

                          (DETERMINED)

           Aye. You got it!

          He throws an arm around Hiccup.

                          STOICK (CONT'D)

           Come on, son.

          ON THE BATTLEFIELD

          VALKA'S DRAGONS SWOOP down to engage the attackers, picking

          up soldiers and carrying them off while Drago stands in the

          line of fire, unflinching.

          The catapults continue to bring down the icy defenses of

          dragon mountain. Drago's men pour into the tunnels. 

                          DRAGO

           Whatever comes, keep hitting the

           mountain! We need to draw the alpha

           out.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 70.

          Drago's armored DRAGON ARMY takes wing, clashing with Valka's

          dragons in the skies.

                          DRAGO (CONT'D)

           Ready the traps!

          Iron jaws are opened like bear traps, revealing screeching

          `bait' dragons within. Valka's dragons swoop down to rescue

          them, only to be SNAPPED UP in the fearsome jaws.

          A second set of traps are cocked open, but instead of dragon

          cries, ZIPPLEBACK GAS seeps out... followed by an EXPLOSION.

          The TWINS rocket out of the trap, riding BARF and BELCH.

                          TUFFNUT

           Surprise! Yeah!

                          DRAGO

           WHAT?!

          They're joined by Astrid and the rest of the GANG, bursting

          out of the traps atop Meatlug and Hookfang.

          Eret comes flying out last, WAILING aboard Stormfly. He

          struggles to hold on, as she rejoins Astrid (riding Meatlug,

          along with Fishlegs). He gives them a sheepish shrug.

                          ASTRID

           You really are full of surprises.

          She leaps onto Stormfly, steadying them.

                          ASTRID (CONT'D)

           Let's go!

          Together they rocket across the sky...

                          TUFFNUT

           Dragon Riders coming through!

          And DIVE-BOMB the traps, setting them aflame. The yokes and

          leather bindings restraining the bait dragons are

          incinerated, freeing them to fly away, unharmed.

                          DRAGO

           CUT THEM DOWN!

          Projectiles are launched, one of which KNOCKS Ruffnut off her

          dragon. She PLUMMETS past Eret toward the rocky shore below.

                          RUFFNUT

           Eret, son of Eret!

          She suddenly grabbed by both arms before hitting the rocks.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 71.

          RUFFNUT'S POV: of Snotlout on one side... and Fishlegs on the

          other. SOFT and ROMANTICIZED as her epiphany dawns.

          Above them, more catapults fire, bringing down massive spires

          of ice, directly over Astrid and Eret.

                          ASTRID

           Up, girl! To the left, Eret! That's

           it! Look out!

          It's about to crush them when... it's BLOWN TO PIECES by

          Toothless' fireball. Hiccup, Stoick, and Gobber come bursting

          through the flames on their dragons.

          Hiccup and Toothless arc across the sky triumphantly and set

          their sights on a downed dragon surrounded by soldiers.

          Toothless BLASTS one of Drago's net launchers, knocking it

          onto its side. Stoick then CHOPS the trigger line, FIRING the

          catapult and NETTING the throng of soldiers, freeing the

          dragon.

          Drago's ARCHERS target Stoick with their arrows.

                          ARCHER

           Take `em down!

                          GOBBER

           Heads up!

          Gobber flies up from behind, KNOCKING the archers out with

          Grump's tail. Gobber chuckles.

          DRAGO hears Toothless' tell-tale BANSHEE scream and turns to

          see him streaking across the sky.

                          DRAGO

           Dragon Master.

          Hiccup catches up to Astrid and Eret on Stormfly.

                          HICCUP

           Welcome aboard, dragon rider!

                          ERET

           Thanks. I think.

          Astrid glares, both relieved and annoyed to see Hiccup.

                          ASTRID

           Where have you been?

                          HICCUP

           Oh, y'know. Catching up with Mom.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 72.

          Astrid shoots him a confused glare. He nods skyward. Astrid

          and Eret look up to see...

          VALKA, in full warrior garb, rising from the towering ice

          spikes, atop Cloudjumper.

                          ERET

           Whoa...

          An earth-trembling roar follows as the Bewilderbeast rises

          behind Valka.

                          ASTRID

           That's your mother?!

                          HICCUP

           Well, now you know where I get my

           dramatic flair.

          ON DRAGO, gawking in awe as the great BEWILDERBEAST BLASTS

          an epic explosion of ice upon the attackers.

                          DRAGO

           The alpha! Now we have a fight!

          Valka blasts overhead on Cloudjumper, commanding swarms of

          dragons to swoop down and attack Drago's army. A swarm of

          Zipplebacks set themselves aflame and roll like fiery wagon

          wheels through the battlefield, scattering soldiers and

          destroying war machines.

          One of them gets CAUGHT under a Dragon Swatter, but Hiccup

          and Toothless double-back for a rescue.

                          HICCUP

           There! Come on, Toothless! Show

           them what you got, bud.

          Toothless dive-bombs the swatter and DESTROYS it with a

          plasma bolt, freeing the dragon.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Thatta boy!

          BACK TO VALKA, on Cloudjumper as they pry Drago's armored

          dragons off of the flailing wild ones. A net suddenly

          envelops Cloudjumper. They CRASH heavily, but Valka cuts

          herself free, sliding to a stop just paces away from Drago.

                          DRAGO

           I've waited a long time for this!

          Drago cocks his bull hook, ready to strike, but Valka

          deflects Drago's hit and attacks him.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 73.

                          VALKA

           You cannot take our dragons! They

           are controlled by the alpha!

                          DRAGO

                          (SMUG)

           Then it's a good thing I brought a

           challenger.

          He turns to the flagship and YELLS savagely, whirling his

          bullhook overhead.

          The heavy chains are released. The underwater creature, now

          freed, breaks the surface in an epic cascade of seawater. It

          rises toward the shoreline, revealing itself to be...

          A SECOND BEWILDERBEAST -- bigger, meaner, and covered in

          scars that indicate years of training and abuse. The chains

          fall away from iron cuffs fastened to its massive tusks.

          Valka GASPS.

                          HICCUP

                          (HORRIFIED)

           Another one?

                          FISHLEGS

           I WAS WAY OFF! THAT IS A CLASS TEN!

           CLASS TEN!

          Drago's challenger lumbers onto the beach, focused on Valka's

          Bewilderbeast.

                          VALKA

           No. No.

                          DRAGO

           Come on! Take down the alpha!

          Valka attacks Drago with her bullhook, trying to stop his

          commands, but Drago strikes back, knocking her forcefully

          onto her back. He pins her as she struggles, removing her

          mask and staff. He's about to finish her off, when WHAM! He's

          knocked to the ground. He looks up, fuming, to see Stoick

          helping Valka to her feet.

                          VALKA

           Thank you.

                          STOICK

           For you, my dear... anything.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 74.

          As Drago gathers his weapon and drops his heavy cloak,

          circling Stoick, Drago's Bewilderbeast confronts Valka's in a

          threat display.

                          STOICK (CONT'D)

           Val, do you think you can stop

           them?

                          VALKA

           I'll do my best! Come on,

           Cloudjumper!

          Valka cuts the nets away and hops onto Cloudjumper, flying

          off toward the Bewilderbeasts as they charge each other,

          CLASHING TUSKS.

          Drago LUNGES at Stoick, SWIPING his bullhook.

                          DRAGO

           You... I watched you burn!

          The two imposing warriors CLASH WEAPONS, SLASHING and LANDING

          PUNCHES.

                          STOICK

           It takes more than a little fire to

           kill me!

          Valka flies between the Bewilderbeasts, waving her staff

          commandingly, but to no effect.

          BACK TO STOICK AND DRAGO

          As Drago hooks and yanks the axe out of Stoick's hands.

          Gobber flies by and HURLS his mace attachment.

                          GOBBER

           Stoick!

          Stoick catches it and lands a direct hit on Drago.

          But, with a devastating SWIPE, DRAGO's Bewilderbeast takes

          down Valka's, plunging in its tusks and burying its

          opponent's lifeless body under an avalanche.

                          VALKA

           No!

          Hiccup and the others watch in horror as dragons everywhere

          land and bow their heads in acknowledgement of the new alpha -

          - DRAGO'S ALPHA.

                          DRAGO

           We've won.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 75.

          Drago points his bullhook toward Valka and Cloudjumper.

                          DRAGO (CONT'D)

           Now finish her!

          Stoick whirls around, spotting Valka and Cloudjumper in the

          alpha's sights.

                          STOICK

           No!

          Drago's Bewilderbeast INHALES... and BLASTS! Valka steers

          Cloudjumper out of the way, but ice HITS his tail, causing

          them to SPIRAL out of control toward the icy spires.

                          STOICK (CONT'D)

           Hold on!

          He LEAPS onto Skullcrusher, spurring him into the air.

                          STOICK (CONT'D)

           Skullcrusher, go! Come on, Gobber!

          Stoick tosses the mace back to Gobber in passing, who follows

          brazenly, waving it aloft.

                          GOBBER

           Right behind ya, Stoick!

          EXT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - CONTINUOUS

          (Scene 2000 - Stoick's Sacrifice)

          With his tail impaired, Cloudjumper struggles against a

          throng of oncoming dragons. Valka is knocked off, but manages

          to cling to her dragon's neck.

          As she loses her grip and FALLS...

          Stoick LEAPS from Skullcrusher and CATCHES Valka. He sinks

          his axe into an icy column, and they slide to a safe landing.

          Drago's Bewilderbeast presses closer, sniffing them out.

          BACK TO HICCUP, spotting Drago on the battlefield, commanding

          the Bewilderbeast to finish the job.

                          HICCUP

           STOP! Stop!

          Hiccup lands Toothless a few paces from Drago and brazenly

          removes his helmet. Drago eyes him, incredulous, then begins

          to CHUCKLE.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 76.

                          DRAGO

           This... is the great dragon master?

           The son of Stoick the Vast? What

           shame he must feel.

          Toothless snarls, ready to blast, but Hiccup calms him with a

          hand gesture.

                          HICCUP

           All of this loss, and for what? To

           become unstoppable? To rule the

           world?

          Drago smirks and turns away from Hiccup.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Dragons are kind, amazing creatures

           that can bring people together.

                          DRAGO

           Or tear them apart.

          Drago LAUGHS mockingly, then removes his FALSE ARM, revealing

          a stump at his shoulder. Hiccup is taken aback.

                          DRAGO (CONT'D)

           You see, I know what it is to live

           in fear. To see my village burned,

           my family taken.

          He reattaches the prosthesis, circling Hiccup menacingly.

                          DRAGO (CONT'D)

           But even as a boy, left with

           nothing, I vowed to rise above the

           fear of dragons and liberate the

           people of this world.

                          HICCUP

           Then why a dragon army?

                          DRAGO

           (grinning, smug)

           Well, you need dragons to conquer

           other dragons.

                          HICCUP

           Or maybe you need dragons to

           conquer people.

                          (BEAT)

           To control those who follow you...

           and to get rid of those who won't.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 77.

                          DRAGO

           Clever boy.

          Drago grabs his bullhook and re-approaches Hiccup. Toothless

          readies himself.

                          HICCUP

           The world wants peace. And we have

           the answer, back on Berk. Just let

           me show you.

                          DRAGO

           NO! Let ME show YOU.

          Drago SHRIEKS madly, summoning the Bewilderbeast. Toothless

          circles Hiccup, protectively.

          ON THE BEWILDERBEAST, about to blast Stoick and Valka. It

          hears Drago's distant wails, and approaches obediently.

                          STOICK

           What...?

          Stoick follows its stare to the distant battlefield below. He

          spots Hiccup and Toothless a few paces from Drago.

                          STOICK (CONT'D)

                          (PANICKED)

           Hiccup!

          He rushes off. Valka follows, racing past Gobber as he

          finally joins them, winded from having run up the mountain.

                          STOICK (CONT'D)

           Come on, Gobber!

                          GOBBER

           Okay, change of plans.

          He hurries back down the mountain after them.

          BACK TO DRAGO

          jabbing his bullhook into the ground commandingly. The

          Bewilderbeast flinches and stops, submissive.

                          DRAGO

           No dragon can resist the alpha's

           command. So he who controls the

           alpha, controls them all.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 78.

          Drago points to Toothless. The Bewilderbeast stares and

          HISSES, forcing Toothless to cower under a hypnotic

          ultrasonic broadcast. Toothless struggles against the alpha's

          command, writhing and grinding his head against the ground.

                          HICCUP

           Toothless? You okay, bud? What's

           going on?

          Toothless fights the command, shaking his head in protest.

          The Bewilderbeast insists, with a mesmerizing glare and a

          low, throaty grumble... until Toothless finally succumbs to

          its control. He raises his head, his stare vacant and

          robotic, as his pupils turn to slits.

          Drago then points to Hiccup. The Bewilderbeast responds,

          HISSING again at Toothless.

                          DRAGO

           Witness true strength. The strength

           of will over others. In the face of

           it, you are nothing.

          Toothless slowly turns to face Hiccup. Advancing.

                          HICCUP

           Uh, what did he just tell you?

                         ON STOICK

          Bounding across the ice, pushing himself to make it to Hiccup

          in time.

          BACK ON HICCUP

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Toothless, what's the matter with

           you? What're you doing?

          Hiccup is backed against fallen ice, with Toothless advancing

          mindlessly, and nowhere to run.

          Toothless opens his yawning mouth. Gas seeps from his throat.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Knock it off! Stop! Snap out of it!

          Stoick barrels through ice formations and over war machines,

          racing against time.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Toothless! No! Toothless! Don't!

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 79.

                          STOICK

           Hiccup!

                          HICCUP

           STOP!

                          STOICK

           SON!

          Hiccup sees Stoick about to run into the fray.

                          HICCUP

           DAD! NO!

          Toothless BLASTS.

          Stoick leaps in front of it, shoving Hiccup out of the way

          and absorbing the blast in the process. He's thrown against

          the ice with great impact.

          ON VALKA, hearing the blast, horrified.

          Drago glances back, seeing Stoick laying lifeless in the

          aftermath, pleased by the sudden turn of events. He shuffles

          off, satisfied.

          Stunned, Hiccup comes to and sees Stoick in the rubble. He

          rushes past the still-entranced Toothless, straining to

          scatter the ice boulders on top of Stoick's body.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Dad!

          Valka arrives, winded and aghast.

                          VALKA

           Stoick...

          She helps Hiccup to turn Stoick's body over. Valka presses

          her ear to Stoick's heart, confirming his death with a mere

          glance to Hiccup. He tears up, overwhelmed.

                          HICCUP

           No... you...

          Gobber, Astrid, Eret, and the Gang arrive, slack-jawed.

          Satisfied, the Bewilderbeast turns away, releasing Toothless

          of the trance-like state. Toothless blinks, coming to and

          confused. He approaches the group, sniffing Stoick's hand.

          Hiccup SHOVES him.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           No! Get away from him!

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 80.

          Toothless recoils, innocently.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           GO ON! GET OUT OF HERE! GET AWAY!

          Toothless retreats like a scolded dog, ear plates back and

          head hung low. Valka watches, broken-hearted, as Hiccup falls

          upon Stoick, inconsolable.

                          VALKA

           It's not his fault. You know that.

          On the battlefield, the alpha BELLOWS, calling all of the

          dragons to gather. Meatlug, Stormfly, Hookfang and the others

          all follow the command as the Gang calls after them.

           VALKA (O.S.) (CONT'D)

           Good dragons under the control of

           bad people do bad things.

          Drago notices Toothless tumble down a snow-bank, once again

          slit-eyed and entranced, but unable to fly to the alpha

          without a rider. Drago pins him down, eyeing the saddle,

          pedals, and prosthetic tail.

          ON HICCUP and VALKA

          In tears as Toothless rises into view, with Drago in the

          saddle.

                          DRAGO

           GATHER THE MEN AND MEET AT BERK!

          His soldiers cheer in the thousands.

                          HICCUP

           Toothless!

          Hiccup tries to go after Toothless, but Valka holds him back.

                          VALKA

           No, don't!

          Drago JABS his bull hook and points toward the horizon. The

          alpha BELLOWS, commanding an exodus as it leads the way.

                          DRAGO

           Move out!

          Hiccup watches, powerless as all dragons TAKE WING and

          follow.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 81.

          EXT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - LAGOON - DUSK

          (Scene 2100 - Viking Funeral)

          A KEEL grinds against the shoreline pebbles as a listing,

          battered ship is pushed into the still iceberg-filled lagoon.

           GOBBER (V.O.)

           May the Valkyries welcome you, and

           lead you through Odin's great

           battlefield. May they sing your

           name with love and fury, so that we

           might hear it rise from the heights

           of Valhalla... and know that you've

           taken your rightful place at the

           table of kings.

          Bows and pitch-dipped arrows are gathered from the

          battlefield. Gobber hands a set to Hiccup, meeting his eyes

          with sympathetic glance.

           GOBBER (V.O.)

           For a great man has fallen. A

           warrior. A chieftain. A father. A

           friend.

          Hiccup dips his arrowhead in a smoldering chunk of wreckage,

          igniting the pitch that coats the tip.

          He releases his arrow, which sails through the air and lands

          on the deck of the ship, where Stoick is laid out on a pyre,

          covered by a sail, his axe upon his chest.

          The others follow Hiccup's lead. They DRAW BACK in unison and

          LOOSE their arrows, filling the sky with crisscrossing,

          flaming streaks. They arc over the lagoon and set the ship

          alight.

          ON HICCUP, fighting back emotion and losing the battle.

                          HICCUP

           I'm sorry, Dad.

          He eyes the engulfed ship.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           I'm not the chief that you wanted

           me to be. And I'm not peacekeeper I

           thought I was. I don't know...

          Valka watches him, her heart breaking. She steps forward.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 82.

                          VALKA

           You came early into this world. You

           were such a wee thing. So frail, so

           fragile. I feared you wouldn't make

           it.

          Hiccup lowers his eyes, but Valka lifts his chin.

                          VALKA (CONT'D)

           But your father... he never

           doubted. He always said you'd

           become the strongest of them all.

                          (BEAT)

           And he was right.

                          (BEAT)

           You have the heart of a chief and

           the soul of a dragon. Only you can

           bring our worlds together. That is

           who you are, son.

          Hiccup meets her bolstering stare. He turns to the ship and

          watches it in silence, silhouetted in its glow.

                          HICCUP

           I was so afraid of becoming my dad.

           Mostly because I thought I never

           could. How do you become someone

           that great? That brave? That

           selfless?

                          (BEAT)

           I guess you can only try.

           (to the others)

           A chief protects his own. We're

           going back.

                          TUFFNUT

           Uh, with what?

                          RUFFNUT

           He took all the dragons.

                          HICCUP

           Not all of them.

          EXT. ICE CHANNELS - MOMENTS LATER

          (Scene 2200 - Hatchlings to the Rescue)

          WHOOSH! WHOOSH! WHOOSH! JUVENILES BLUR past, like flying

          raptors, ZIGZAGGING wildly.

          Riding bareback, Hiccup & Co. HURTLE through the narrow ICE

          CHANNELS -- created by massive splits in the iceberg shelves.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 83.

                          RUFFNUT

           Fly straight!

                          FISHLEGS

           I don't want to die!

                          TUFFNUT

           We can't fly these things!

                          FISHLEGS

           Yeah, no kidding!

          Fishlegs barrels into a snow bank, sending several chunks

          right into Eret's face as rides inverted and HOLLERING.

                          ASTRID

           But won't that Bewilderbeast just

           take control of these guys, too?

                          HICCUP

           They're babies. They don't listen

           to anyone!

                          TUFFNUT

           Yeah, just like us!

          Gobber follows up the rear clumsily, STRUGGLING for control.

                          GOBBER

           This... is... very dangerous!

          He PULLS ALONGSIDE Hiccup and Valka.

                          GOBBER (CONT'D)

           Some might suggest this is poorly

           conceived.

                          HICCUP

           Well, it's a good thing that I

           never listen.

          A SHARP RIDGE RUSHES up at them. They're going to CRASH.

          Hiccup ROUNDS one side of it, and Gobber flies down the other

          side. They shout through gaps in the iceberg.

                          GOBBER

           So what IS your plan?!

                          HICCUP

           Get Toothless back and kick Drago's-

          He's interrupted by another closure in the gaps of ice. They

          blast out of the other side.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 84.

                          GOBBER

           Heads up!

          They SPLIT to avoid another peak and then reconvene, only to

          find another icy outcropping directly in their path.

                          HICCUP

           And that thing.

          Gobber HITS it, with a THUD and a YELP.

          EXT. BERK - NIGHT

          (Scene 2450 - Hiccup Vs. Toothless)

          Torches burn in their braziers as Berk slumbers... until the

          Bewilderbeast approaches, STOMPING down on the monolithic

          Viking statues that guard the harbor.

          INT. GOTHI'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

          The sound of destruction rouses a flock of Terrible Terrors

          and Gothi, who was sleeping under the dragons. Their pupils

          turn to slits, and heeding the ultrasonic call, they fly off.

          Gothi shuffles onto her deck, confused, then GASPS at

          horrifying sight.

          INT. VIKING HUT - CONTINUOUS

          A Gronckle lounges peacefully by the fire, as his Viking

          owner lavishes him with scratches.

                          HOARK

           Ah, that's a good boy!

          The Gronckle's eyes suddenly turn to slits and it, too, takes

          wing, knocking over a chair and table as it heads for the

          door.

                          HOARK (CONT'D)

           Watch the furniture! Where are you

           going?

          It barrels out of the hut and into the night sky as the

          Viking rushes to the doorway, spotting the same arresting

          sight with a gasp.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 85.

          EXT. GREAT HALL - CONTINUOUS

          Vikings pour out of the Great Hall as all of Berk's dragons

          fill the night sky and join the ranks of Drago's growing

          DRAGON ARMY.

          The Bewilderbeast rises out of the sea, bearing down on the

          people of Berk as Drago hovers on Toothless, leading the

          charge. The Vikings stare, aghast.

                          DRAGO

           Your chief is dead.

          Waves of shock and whispers of "Stoick?" spread through the

          crowd.

                          DRAGO (CONT'D)

           No one can protect you now.

          He thrusts his bull-hook, commanding the Bewilderbeast to

          fire. The Vikings watch in horror as the Bewilderbeast opens

          its yawning jaws and BLASTS.

          EXT. SKIES/BERK - NIGHT

          Dragon roars grow louder as Hiccup & Co. approach through

          clouds, racing against time.

          They collectively GASP at the sight of Drago's Bewilderbeast

          having now covered most of the village in explosions of ice.

          Berk's now commandeered dragons circle in a huddle behind

          him, joining Valka's flock, and corralled by Drago's armored

          dragons.

                          HICCUP

           No...

                          FISHLEGS

           He took all the dragons!

                          HICCUP

                          (FUMING)

           Distract the alpha. Try to keep his

           focus off of Toothless.

                          TUFFNUT

           Uh... how?

                          ERET

           Have you forgotten who you're

           riding with?

          He brazenly aims his baby dragon toward the Bewilderbeast.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 86.

                          ERET (CONT'D)

           There isn't a dragon alive that I

           can't wrangle!

          His baby dragon dives toward the sea instead.

                          ERET (CONT'D)

           Except for this one!

                          SNOTLOUT

           Amateur.

          The others shrug and follow. As they get closer, the

          Bewilderbeast looms bigger and BIGGER.

          Berk's Vikings in hiding notice Hiccup and the others as they

          approach.

                          VIKING #1

           Look, it's Hiccup!

          The Vikings CHEER.

          ON DRAGO, surprised to see Hiccup and the others approaching.

                          DRAGO

           What?

          With an irate HUFF, the Bewilderbeast focuses on Hiccup,

          gaining ever closer to Toothless.

          Suddenly, a SHEEP appears in its sight, rising and falling

          out of view. The Bewilderbeast blinks, confused.

          It looks down to see Eret catching the falling sheep and

          reloading it into the game launcher, as Tuffnut cocks the

          mechanism and Ruffnut pulls the trigger.

                          RUFFNUT

           Keep `em coming!

          Snotlout tosses the black sheep to Tuffnut.

                          SNOTLOUT

           Black sheep, baby!

          Exasperated, the alpha inhales, about to blast, when... HONK!

          The game horn blares, breaking his concentration.

          He turns, finding the horn unmanned. The Bewilderbeast then

          returns his focus to the sheep launcher, until the BLACK

          SHEEP LANDS on the his face, bouncing down his facial spines

          and becoming lodged.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 87.

                          SNOTLOUT (CONT'D)

           Ten points!

          The Bewilderbeast shakes the black sheep off and prepares to

          blast again.

                          SNOTLOUT (CONT'D)

           Uh-oh...

          HONK! The alpha whips around -- still no one at the horn.

          ON FISHLEGS, giggling and hiding behind the game horn.

          The Bewilderbeast finally lets loose the ice blast, covering

          the entire horn in jagged spikes... as Fishlegs leaps from

          the platform.

                          FISHLEGS

           I'm okay!

          BACK TO HICCUP

          as he reaches Drago, hovering directly in Toothless' sights.

                          DRAGO

           You certainly are hard to get rid

           of. I'll say that.

          Hiccup ignored him and focuses on Toothless' slitted pupils.

                          HICCUP

           Toothless? It's me, bud. It's me.

           I'm right here. Come back to me.

          TOOTHLESS' POV: Hiccup appears as an unfamiliar red blur,

          still firmly under the control of the Bewilderbeast.

                          DRAGO

           He is not yours anymore. He belongs

           to the alpha!

          Drago smugly sits back in the saddle, his arms open in

          invitation.

                          DRAGO (CONT'D)

           But, please, oh great dragon

           master, try to take him. He will

           not miss a second time.

          Hiccup holds strong, maintaining eye contact with Toothless.

          He reaches out to touch him.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 88.

                          HICCUP

           It wasn't your fault, bud. They

           made you do it.

          Drago's amusement fades as Toothless stirs. His pupils

          DILATE, then NARROW again.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           You'd never hurt him.

                          (BEAT)

           You'd never hurt me.

          Drago watches, amazed, as Toothless fights the control.

                          DRAGO

           How are you doing that?

          Hiccup holds the stare, tears in his eyes.

                          HICCUP

           Please. You are my best friend,

           bud.

          Bewilderbeast ROARS a forceful command.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           My best friend.

          Toothless' pupils jitter, then DILATE fully. He coos

          sympathetically.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Thatta boy! That's it! I'm here!

          Toothless' eyes finally dilate fully and resolve on Hiccup's

          familiar face.

          Drago goes from astounded to alarmed. Drago STRIKES Toothless

          with the bull hook in a vain attempt to regain control.

                          DRAGO

           No!

          Toothless ROARS defiantly, snatches the bull hook in his

          jaws, and PULLS... yanking Drago off of his back and sending

          him both PLUMMETING to the sea.

                          HICCUP

           Yeah!

          But without a rider, Toothless drops out of the sky as well.

          Hiccup leaps from the baby dragon, diving after him.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 89.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Hang on!

          Drago breaks his fall, landing heavily upon the

          Bewilderbeast's tusk...

          As Hiccup tucks in his arms, trying to close the gap between

          he and Toothless before they both make impact with the ocean.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Almost there, buddy. Almost there!

          Hiccup reaches Toothless. They pair up, mid-air, and

          skyrocket past Drago as he hobbles to the top of the alpha's

          head.

          EXT. BERK - VILLAGE - MOMENTS LATER

          (Scene 2500 - One True Alpha)

          Hiccup looks back at Drago, now issuing commands from the top

          of the Bewilderbeast's head.

                          DRAGO

           Do something!

                          HICCUP

           We need to get those two apart.

          Hiccup flies Toothless past a flag pole tears a strip of the

          flag.

          The Bewilderbeast BLASTS in their direction, barely missing

          them as they disappear around the back of a mountain.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           We gotta block him out, Toothless.

           Do you trust me, bud?

          Toothless coos, allowing Hiccup to BLINDFOLD him with the

          flag. Hiccup calms him with a touch.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           We can do this. You and me. As one.

          Hiccup SPLAYS Toothless' mechanical tail. Toothless responds,

          MATCHING the move with the natural half.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           That's it. Now let's try this one

           more time!

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 90.

          They PEEL around the other side of the mountain, heading

          back toward Drago and Bewilderbeast, passing Astrid and the

          cheering Vikings on the ground.

                          ASTRID

           Take them down, babe!

          The Viking roar in support as Hiccup and Toothless race past.

          Valka watches with pride as her son hurtles towards Drago and

          the alpha.

                          VALKA

           Go get `em.

                          DRAGO

           Take control of it!

          The Bewilderbeast's HISS becomes a furious ROAR, but to no

          avail. Hiccup clamps his hands over Toothless' ear plates,

          muffling the alpha's commands.

                          HICCUP

           Shut it out, Toothless!

                          DRAGO

           STOP THEM!

          The Bewilderbeast BLASTS!

                          HICCUP

           NOW!

          Toothless suddenly PULLS UP, ARCING over Drago's head! Drago

          LAUGHS, victorious, then pauses in shock.

          DRAGO'S POV: as Toothless climbs inverted through the sky,

          the blindfold falls free, revealing an EMPTY SADDLE.

          Drago WHIRLS around, wide-eyed, to see...

          HICCUP ZOOMING TOWARD HIM, his wing-suit deployed, and his

          Dragon Blade trailing Zippleback gas. Drago SWIPES but misses

          him. Hiccup clicks the lighter and ignites the gas, blasting

          Drago off his Bewilderbeast with a SCREAM.

          Drago PLUMMETS, BREAKING HIS FALL against the massive

          dragon's spines and landing hard on the ground, his bullhook

          landing just out of reach.

          The Bewilderbeast WHIPS its tail, trying to SWAT down Hiccup.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Not again.

                          (BEAT)

           TOOTHLESS! IT'S NOW OR NEVER!

          Toothless pops open his dorsal blades, arcs skyward, and

          rejoins Hiccup just before colliding with the alpha's tail.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Come on, bud!

          Together again, they speed along the length of the thrashing

          tail...

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Hold on!

          And shoot past the tip of the tail, narrowly making it!

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Yeah! We did it!

          They arc through the sky and LAND a few paces from Drago,

          kicking up a trail of dust.

          Battered and weary, Drago reaches for his bullhook. Hiccup

          extends and fires up his Dragon Blade, hurling it like a

          javelin, and sticking it in the ground between Drago and his

          weapon, singeing his outstretched hand.

                          DRAGO

           Agghh!

                          HICCUP

           Hold him there Toothless!

          Toothless SNARLS a warning, ready to blast.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           It's all over now.

          But the cloud of dust settles, revealing the Bewilderbeast,

          rising behind Hiccup, ready to blast him instead.

                          DRAGO

                          (GRINNING KNOWINGLY)

           Or is it?

          Hiccup spins around, alarmed, as a RUSH of water THUNDERS up

          the Bewilderbeast's throat.

                          HICCUP

           Oh, no!

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 92.

          It BLASTS, but Toothless leaps into the way, shielding Hiccup

          beneath him. The freezing explosion envelops them both.

          Drago laughs to himself as Valka lands her baby dragon and

          rushes to the icy explosion, hammering away at it

          desperately.

                          VALKA

           No! No...

          ON ASTRID and GOBBER, watching from a distance, horrified. As

          Valka POUNDS at the ice, a GLOWS forms from deep within. She

          realizes what is about to happen and backs away.

          A BLAST thunders from inside the ice, SHATTERING it.

          Toothless emerges from the debris, revealing Hiccup curled

          safely under his wings.

          Toothless is steaming, his black skin glowing blue with rage,

          his split dorsal blades searing with blue heat, a glow

          emanating from his flared nostrils.

          He turns back to Hiccup, to check if he's unharmed, then

          turns his full attention back to the Bewilderbeast. He leaps

          out of the crater and lands upon an ice spire, roaring

          ferociously.

          The Bewilderbeast bellows back at this affront. Toothless

          unleashes a salvo of plasma into the Bewilderbeast's face,

          not letting up.

                          HICCUP

           He's challenging the alpha!

                          VALKA

           To protect you.

          The Bewilderbeast ROARS at this act of insubordination.

          Toothless fires back, time and again, fully in control.

          The alpha thrashes his tusks through the ice, trying to smash

          Toothless, but he deftly spring from spire to spire,

          continuing his unrelenting attack.

          In the midst of the mayhem, the horde of commandeered dragons

          -- both Berk's and Valka's -- break free from the control to

          witness Toothless' retaliation.

          Toothless lands protectively by Hiccup and Valka, commanding

          the dragons to shift sides. The follow, amassing behind

          Toothless.

          Seeing this, Drago panics and rushes toward the

          Bewilderbeast.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 93.

                          DRAGO

           No, no, no, no! Fight back! Fight!

           FIGHT!

          Drago clambers up the Bewilderbeast's tusk, totally unhinged.

                          DRAGO (CONT'D)

           (to the defecting dragons)

           What's the matter with you?

          The Berkians swell in to show their unified support. Drago

          fumes as Hiccup and Toothless fly up together onto an ice

          spire.

                          HICCUP

           Now do you get it? This is what it

           is to earn a dragon's loyalty.

                          (BEAT)

           Let this end now.

                          DRAGO

           Never! Come on!

          He hammers the Bewilderbeast, spurring it into a charge.

          Toothless calls over his shoulder, commanding the dragons to

          ready themselves. He then BLASTS the Bewilderbeast, mid-

          charge. Suddenly, Skullcrusher fires. Followed by another,

          and another.

          Hiccup looks around, amazed to see the flock of dragons

          opening fire on Drago and his Bewilderbeast. They've started

          a rebellion.

          Drago is forced to hide from the fiery barrage by taking

          cover in the tall spines of the giant's crown.

                          DRAGO (CONT'D)

           FIGHT! BLAST THEM!

          His prosthetic arm is blasted clean off by one of his own

          armored dragons.

          The Bewilderbeast rears back to cover them all in ice, but

          Toothless lets loose a powerful shot. The Bewilderbeast's

          head is KNOCKED backward by a blue-flame fireball.

          As the smoke clears, one of its massive TUSKS FALLS to the

          ground, sheared clean off. Drago glares at Toothless.

          Toothless ROARS commandingly, calling an end to the fight.

                          HICCUP

           The alpha protects them all.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 94.

          Overwhelmed and overpowered, the Bewilderbeast yields to the

          new alpha and heeds Toothless' command, retreating into the

          sea in an explosive splash.

          The Berkians CHEER in victory!

          As the smoke clears, Hiccup and Toothless see nothing but

          bubbles on the waves to mark their disappearance. No sign of

          the Bewilderbeast... or Drago.

          Toothless hops down from the spire, cooling off, as people

          celebrate all around them.

          All of the dragons -- Berk's, Valka's, even Drago's -- land

          around Toothless. Cloudjumper bows to Toothless, starting a

          wave of bows, acknowledging their new alpha.

          Toothless looks around, surprised, then lets out a majestic

          ROAR. The assembled dragons join in, roaring in tribute.

          Toothless turns to Hiccup as he approaches.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           You never cease to amaze me, bud.

           Thank you.

          Toothless GURGLES and licks Hiccup's face. Hiccups squeals,

          trying to get away.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Toothless! You know that doesn't

           wash out.

          The crowd laughs. All around them, Berk's dragons reunite

          with their Vikings.

                          ASTRID

           Stormfly!

          Stormfly bounds into Astrid.

                          GOBBER

           Oh, give me a cuddle, Grumpy!

          Grump lands ON TOP of Gobber, flattening him.

          Relieved to the point of tears, Snotlout and Fishlegs race

          towards the expectant Ruffnut...

                          FISHLEGS

           Who's my little princess?

          ... and then right PAST her to embrace their dragons.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 95.

                          FISHLEGS (CONT'D)

           I missed you so much!

                          SNOTLOUT

           Don't you ever leave again,

           Hookfang!

          Ruffnut GRUMBLES, dejected. Barf dips his head in to console

          her.

                          RUFFNUT

           Oh Barf!

          She hugs him. Belch looms in for some affection, but Ruffnut

          pushes him away...

                          RUFFNUT (CONT'D)

           Not you.

          And into Tuffnut who glowers back at her.

          Hiccup smiles, taking in the happy reunions. Skullcrusher

          approaches him, without an owner to reunite with. Hiccup pets

          him, as Eret approaches.

                          ERET

           That was some pretty fine dragon

           wrangling back there. You'd make a

           good trapper.

          Before Hiccup can respond, Skullcrusher nuzzles Eret

          affectionately. Eret chuckles and gently strokes him.

                          HICCUP

           Y'know, Skullcrusher's gonna need

           somebody to look after him now.

                          ERET

           Me?

          Hiccup nods reassuringly. Eret looks at Skullcrusher, pausing

          to consider it.

                          ERET (CONT'D)

           I'd be honored.

          Valka walks up to her son, bursting with pride.

                          VALKA

           Your father... he'd be every bit as

           proud as I am.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 96.

                          HICCUP

           Thank you. I'm really glad you're

           here, Mom.

                          VALKA

           And here I'll stay.

          Toothless arrives, purring at Valka's touch as Astrid strides

          toward Hiccup, beaming proudly.

                          ASTRID

           See? I told you it was in here.

          She places her hand upon his chest, then quickly pokes the

          dorsal fin button, popping it open. She GIGGLES.

                          HICCUP

           Ha, ha. Still doing that one?

           That's hilarious.

                          (THEN)

           Come here, you.

          He scoops Astrid close and pulls her into a kiss. Gobber

          covers a gawking boy's eyes.

                          GOBBER

           Ooh.

          Gothi, the elder, taps Hiccup's shoulder, interrupting the

          romantic moment. She gestures for Hiccup to kneel. He does

          so, respectfully.

          Using ash from a heap of burnt wreckage, Gothi traces a

          Viking symbol onto Hiccup's forehead. She bows.

          Hiccup stands, meeting Gobber's proud, smiling eyes. Gobber

          turns to the silent crowd and throws up his arms.

                          GOBBER (CONT'D)

           The chief has come home!

          The Berkians erupt with cheers and applause as Hiccup takes

          in the moment, acknowledging the weight of responsibility now

          upon him.

          Toothless throws back his head and BLASTS in celebration,

          spurring all other dragons to follow suit, lighting up the

          sky in a spectacular display.

          EXT. BERK VILLAGE - DAY

          (Scene 2700 - A New Beginning)

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 97.

          A sheep grazes lazily on the grass as a Terrible Terror

          struggles in vain to carry him off. Suddenly, both are

          snatched up by a passing dragon.

          IN THE AIR

          Ruffnut and Tuffnut wrestle over the sheep atop Barf & Belch.

          Ruffnut send the sheep flying toward Fishlegs. Snotlout nabs

          it instead, blowing a kiss mockingly.

           HICCUP (V.O.)

           This... is Berk. A bit trampled and

           busted and covered in ice, but it's

           home. It's our home.

          They swoop past a gathered crowd on the battered bleachers as

          Snotlout dunks the sheep in his basket. Eret joins the race

          atop Skullcrusher.

          They fly past Hiccup and Toothless, who are steadily hoisting

          a palette of timber and supplies onto a rooftop where workers

          are rebuilding the damaged houses.

          Hiccup then turns his attention to a massive statue of

          Stoick, presently under construction. He grins with pride.

           HICCUP (V.O.)

           Those who attacked us are

           relentless and crazy. But those who

           stopped them? Oh, even more so!

          He looks to the horizon, scanning it from east to west to

          ensure that no trouble is approaching.

          Astrid and Stormfly buzz past him playfully, coaxing him to

          join the game. He smiles.

           HICCUP (V.O.)

           We may be small in numbers, but we

           stand for something bigger than

           anything the world can pit against

           us.

          Astrid soars past the blacksmith stall, waving to Valka and

          Gobber as they remove the armor from Drago's freed battle

          dragons.

           HICCUP (V.O.)

           We are the voice of peace. And bit

           by bit, we will change this world.

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 98.

          Realizing that he's late, Gobber hurries over to the sheep

          launcher and pulls the trigger, sending the black sheep

          hurtling into the air.

          Astrid and Stormfly close in on the black sheep, about to

          snatch it out of the air, when suddenly, Hiccup and Toothless

          dart past, beating them to it. Toothless looks back with a

          gummy smile.

           HICCUP (V.O.)

           You see, we have something they

           don't. Oh sure, they have armies

           and they have armadas...

          Toothless and Hiccup dive toward the line of baskets. As they

          approach, Toothless bounces Hiccup into the air, allowing him

          to dunk the black sheep into Astrid's basket. They reunite on

          the other side. The crowd cheers!

           HICCUP (V.O.)

           But we... we have...

          Hiccup and Toothless land upon the chief's dais, joined by

          Astrid, Stormfly, and the other dragon riders.

           HICCUP (V.O.)

           OUR DRAGONS!

          Toothless lets out a proud roar as Hiccup look out over Berk,

          gleaming with pride.
