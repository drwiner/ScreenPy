FADE IN:

EXT.  ROUTE 476 - OUTSKIRTS OF PHILADELPHIA - NIGHT

A three lane highway relegated to one lane.  The serpentine

line of cars bottlenecks as it slithers by.  An arch of

ORANGE AND RED FLARES outlines the area of shattered glass

and twisted metal.

We are at the site of a gruesome car accident.  An ambulance

and four police cars are on the scene.  Two cars are involved

in the crash.  The first, a SILVER CADILLAC with its front

caved in a perfect semi-circle; there is no-one inside the

car.

The second car is a different story entirely.  A DARK GREEN

HONDA PRELUDE crushed against the concrete median that

separates the South-bound lanes from the North-bound lanes.

All the windows have imploded.  The original seventeen foot

length of the car, compressed to ten.  The hood has folded

back into the front seat.  This car is not empty!  Through

the sliver that used to be a window, WE SEE a female hand,

purple, swollen and bloody.

Some drivers have stopped their cars on the shoulder and have

walked over to the flares.  A set of cops wave them back.

                    POLICE OFFICER

          Get back in your cars and continue

          with the traffic.  There is nothing

          you can do.

              (beat)

          Get back in your cars...

                                                  CUT TO:

OFFICER PIERCE speaks to a female OFFICER DANA.

                    OFFICER PIERCE

          What's the story?

                    OFFICER DANA

          She's been dead about ten minutes.

          The jaws are on the way... Ran a

          license check.  Her name is Ellen

          Parker.  Forty-two years old.

                    OFFICER PIERCE

          What about him?

Pierce gestures to a HISPANIC TEENAGER who is cuffed behind

his back and being led to a police car.

                    OFFICER DANA

          D.U.I.

                    OFFICER PIERCE

          Shit... How old is he?

                    OFFICER DANA

          Seventeen.  It's his grandfather's

          car.  On his way back from drinking

          with the 'boys'.

Pierce lets it sink in.

                    OFFICER PIERCE

          Who do we contact for her?

Dana checks the papers in her hand.

                    OFFICER DANA

          Her husband.  Maurice Parker.  They

          live in Wynnewood.  Married

          seventeen years.

Pierce looks back at what remains of the HONDA PRELUDE.

Beat.

                    OFFICER PIERCE

          There isn't any good left in the

          world, Dana.  Not one damn thing.

CLOSE UP of the hypnotic RED AND BLUE LIGHTS that consume the

highway.

EXT.  ROAD - EARLY MORNING

                    "TWO WEEKS EARLIER"

Just AFTER DAWN.  A gentle mist hangs in the air.  The calm

suburban streets wait to be flooded with a sea of middle

class homeowners on their way to work...

A woman's REEBOK CROSS-TRAINERS move along the sidewalk...

long, brisk steps, steps people have when walking with a

purpose...

The Cross-Trainers enter the doors of a bakery store seconds

after a man turns a window-sign from "CLOSED" to "OPEN"...

This happens with precision timing, not losing a step... a

well practiced routine.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  ANGELO'S BAKERY - MORNING

ANGELO, a large man, black slicked hair -- has laid out three

identical loaves of RAISIN BREAD on the counter.

                    ANGELO

          Very good batch today.

We finally see the person standing in the REEBOK CROSS

TRAINERS... MRS. ELLEN PARKER, a woman in her forties with a

heart-warming smile and wise glint in her eyes.  The kind of

woman that somehow becomes more beautiful with age.

She carefully squeezes each loaf.  Her hand hovers over the

middle loaf.

                    ELLEN

          That one.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KITCHEN - MORNING

Twenty minutes later.  The basket of the "chosen" raisin

bread is placed on the center of a table.  Ellen covers it

with a cloth napkin.

The eggs sizzle in a pan.  We find Ellen cooking breakfast.

A stunning African Grey Parrot sits proudly on Ellen's

shoulder.  CLAUDE is a breathtaking creature with grey

feathers and a cherry red tail.

The DOOR BELL RINGS.

                                                  CUT TO:

FRONT DOOR

where a delivery man hands over a bouquet of VIOLET ORCHIDS.

Claude, still perched on Ellen like a clothing accessory,

spreads his impressive wings defensively.  The delivery man

scans the far wall to find a collection of bird photographs.

A dazzling collection of all kinds of birds, elaborately

framed and hung.

Ellen signs the release and closes the door.  She takes a

deep smell of the violet orchids and looks down the hall to

the open bedroom door with a glowing smile.  We CATCH A

GLIMPSE of a man dressing.

                                                  CUT TO:

KITCHEN

Where Ellen and her husband are eating breakfast.  Claude is

now in a cage in the hallway.

MR. MAURICE PARKER eats a buttered piece of raisin bread.  He

is a man in his late forties, neatly combed hair, his New

York Times folded into a manageable rectangle.  This is a man

who has been seated a great deal of his life... the type of

man who breaks into a sweat when taking out the garbage.

He feels a stare and looks up to find his wife with that

glowing smile.  He smiles back.

Ellen gestures with her eyes to the violet orchids now

displayed proudly on the window ledge.

                    MAURICE

          Yes?

                    ELLEN

          The flowers... they're beautiful.

Maurice studies them.

                    MAURICE

          They are... who sent them?

Beat.  This takes Ellen by surprise.  Maurice catches the

expression.

                    MAURICE

          You thought I sent them?

                    ELLEN

              (disappointed)

          There was no card.

Maurice reaches over and searches the bouquet.

                    MAURICE

          Have I forgotten something?  Is

          this a special day?

                    ELLEN

              (flat)

          It's just a regular day.

Maurice pulls out a small bent card from between the stems.

                    MAURICE

          It's from Dan and Kate Wilkins...

          for dinner last week...

Maurice hands Ellen the card, she looks at it uninterested.

                    MAURICE

          It's a special day isn't it?

                    ELLEN

          Well, I'm sure it's not Christmas,

          because you'd be worried about how

          much money we don't have to spend

          on each other... I know it's not

          New Years, because you'd be going

          on and on about wearing a tuxedo

          and how much you don't like to

          dance... and I'm sure it's not our

          anniversary, because I didn't find

          an envelope with a hundred dollars

          cash on my bureau with a note that

          says, 'Pick out something

          pretty'... Yes -- Maurice -- I'm

          virtually certain it's not a

          special day today.

Ellen begins to eat.  Maurice stares at her...

                    MAURICE

          You're mad at me... You were

          beaming a minute ago, but since I

          didn't send the flowers... now

          you're mad at me.

Beat.

                    MAURICE

          Why would I send flowers?  What's

          the occasion.

Ellen instantly becomes emotional.

                    ELLEN

          Occasion?  Because you love me...

          That's the occasion.

Ellen returns to eating.  Maurice stares at her quietly.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BOOKSTORE - MORNING

A SHAFT OF LIGHT penetrates the darkness of a room... growing

LARGER as the door swings open.

Ellen steps in first followed by Maurice.  Ellen goes

straight for the blinds.  BURST OF LIGHT stab the room.

The spines of the BOOKS catch the light... rows and rows of

books cradled by a maze of mahogany book shelves.  This is an

old-fashioned store with antique chairs at select places.  A

coffee table sits near the window with a set of deep

cushioned sofa-chairs.  This store is a home...

Maurice moves behind the counter and TURNS ON THE RADIO.

CHOPIN FLOWS from the old speakers atop the corner shelves --

delicately.

Ellen opens the door to the store and locks it in that

position with a slanted piece of wood... The store is now

open.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BOOKSTORE - DAY

Half a dozen people wander the isles.  Maurice's eyes drift

to a pair of eleven year olds who have sauntered into the

store.  One boy disappears behind "Philosophy" and reappears

momentarily with his sweat-shirt zipped up to his neck -- a

rectangle is outlined under his shirt.

                    MAURICE

          I see that!

Maurice comes around the corner -- the boys HAUL ASS out of

the store.  They're long gone before Maurice reaches the

door.  He yells after them.

                    MAURICE

          I'm getting a Doberman!  Two!

Ellen who is sitting in the back room doing the accounts,

comes out when she hears the commotion.

                    ELLEN

          You've been saying that for two

          years; I think they know you're

          bluffing.

Maurice inspects the "Philosophy" section.

Maurice looks up as a young man, early twenties, hurries in.

KRIS REDDY walks past Maurice, his black locks of hair

peeking out from under his Philadelphia Eagles cap.

                    KRIS

              (to Maurice)

          Lizy Bennett?

                    ELLEN

          Hi Kris.

Kris waves as he removes his jacket.  He is wearing a PARKER

BOOKS T-shirt underneath.  He pins an "Assistant Manager" tag

on.

Maurice thinks to himself.

                    MAURICE

          Lizy, Eliza... Elizabeth Bennett...

              (the answer comes to him)

          Pride and Prejudice.

                    KRIS

          You're amazing.

                    MAURICE

          It has to be a full character's

          name.

                    KRIS

          They called her 'Lizy' in the

          book...

              (beat)

          Sorry I was late.  My jeep died on

          the way over from the paper.

                    MAURICE

          They printed your article on, 'Dry

          Verses Can Dog Food'... Very

          enlightening.

                    KRIS

          Pulitzer, here I come.

Kris notices as Maurice goes back to searching the isles.

                    KRIS

          What happened?

                    MAURICE

          Never have children.  If they're

          not a burden to you, they're a

          burden to someone else.

                    ELLEN

              (on the end of his words)

          Kris, go to the pharmacy.  Ask Mr.

          Donnavan to get you a large bottle

          of Geritol... Tell him, Maurice has

          officially become a grumpy old man.

                    KRIS

          What'd they take this time?

                    MAURICE

          Nietzsche!... As if they're going

          to read Nietzsche.

Maurice moves back behind the counter clearly irritated.

                    ELLEN

          They pick on you because they can

          get a rise out of you... children

          can sense those things.

Kris quickly opens his black shoulder bag and pulls out a

mini-tape recorder.  He talks into it -- dead serious.

                    KRIS

          Monday -- August 24... Juvenile

          delinquency -- Are the victims to

          blame?

CLICK.  The tape recorder returns to the bag.  Ellen stares

at him curiously.

                    KRIS

          Story ideas.  I'll forget them

          otherwise.

Ellen nods with realization.  Ellen and Kris turn their

attention to Maurice who is mumbling to himself angrily.  He

looks out the window to the street to see a familiar group of

school boys waving at him tauntingly.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

DIMLY LIT.  Red and gold paper mache lanterns are sprinkled

around the room.  WE FIND Ellen and Maurice polishing off a

dish of General Tso's Chicken.

                    MAURICE

          Two thousand square feet... We can

          add a used book section.

Ellen is not listening.  She is staring at a young couple two

tables over, who can't take their eyes off each other.

                    MAURICE

          Next door is a jewelry store with a

          full-time security guard... He

          stands outside all day.  Let's see

          them try and take Nietzsche then...

Maurice finally notices Ellen is not listening.

                    MAURICE

          Ellen?

                    ELLEN

              (snapping out of it)

          What?

                    MAURICE

          The new store?

                    ELLEN

          Honey, I told you.  If it makes you

          happy, we should just do it.

                    MAURICE

          It's a tremendous amount of work --

          moving.

                    ELLEN

          We can do it together.

Maurice needed the support.  His face brightens.

                                                  CUT TO:

LATER

An empty table.  The dishes have been cleared.  Maurice and

Ellen are opening their fortune cookies.

                    MAURICE

          What's your's say?

Beat.

                    ELLEN

          ... Love is shown through actions

          not just words.

                    MAURICE

          What's that?  That's not a

          fortune... You will be rich...

          That's a fortune.  What you have is

          a statement.

                    ELLEN

          What it is -- is the truth.

                    MAURICE

          I don't follow.

Beat.

                    ELLEN

          Maurice, what would you do for me?

          What would you do for our love?

          I'm not talking about saying, I'm

          talking about doing.

Maurice notices the STRAIN IN HER VOICE.

                    MAURICE

          Is this going to be similar to the

          flower incident?

                    ELLEN

              (very emotional)

          Sometimes people need to see things

          done for them -- because sooner or

          later they don't believe the words

          anymore.

                    MAURICE

              (raising his voice)

          You don't think I love you?

Customers react.

                    ELLEN

              (lowering the volume)

          I want to be shown...

              (beat)

          Maurice would you do anything for

          me?

                    MAURICE

          Yes.

                    ELLEN

          Anything?

                    MAURICE

          What do you want from me?  Would I

          swim across an ocean for you?...

          Would I walk across the United

          States for you?  Yes... Yes I

          would.  You know that.

                    ELLEN

              (soft)

          No I don't.  I don't even know if

          you'd walk across the street for

          me.

Maurice is getting redder by the second.  The entire

restaurant hangs on his response...

                    MAURICE

          So what have you done for me that's

          so earth-shattering?

The waiter closest to the table cringes with Maurice's words.

Ellen drains of color.  She stares at him in complete and

utter disbelief.  She drills him with this iron glare for an

eternity then grabs her purse and heads to the exit.  Maurice

stares at the table for a moment to gather what's left of his

dignity and follows her out.

The waiter moves to the table and clears the aftermath.  He

sees Ellen's fortune crumpled next to her tea cup.  He

unravels it.  The fortune reads...

          "YOU ARE A FRIENDLY AND GENEROUS PERSON."

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BEDROOM - DAY

The room is LIT BY ONE BEDSIDE LAMP.  Maurice is sitting in

bed wearing a robe.  Reading glasses at the end of his nose

as he rubs a yellow cloth over a SILVER MEDALLION.  The

medallion has a raised picture of a lamp, the kind Aladdin

uses, seated on an open book and the words BOOK SOCIETY -

1992.  Maurice meticulously rubs away the smudge marks.

Ellen is at the edge of the bed -- as far from Maurice as

possible.  Her back is to him as she sleeps under the covers.

She speaks without turning around.

                    ELLEN

          Why do you polish that thing all

          the time?

                    MAURICE

          You're talking to me?

                    ELLEN

          Why do you polish it?

Maurice studies the impressive silver medallion.

                    MAURICE

          A Book Society Award is a very

          prestigious thing.

                    ELLEN

          Why are you polishing it -- in bed

          -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at

          night?  Are you going to show it to

          someone?

                    MAURICE

          No.

                    ELLEN

          Then why?

                    MAURICE

          There's no reason.

                    ELLEN

          Exactly.  No reason.  No occasion.

          It just makes you feel good to do

          something for it, to express your

          pride and affection for it some

          how...

              (beat)

          How come you'd do that for a piece

          of metal and not for me?

Maurice has no answer.  He just stares at his hands.

ELLEN'S face can be seen under the covers facing away from

Maurice.  Her eyes are red.  The tears roll off her nose and

land on the pillow unseen and unheard.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KITCHEN - MORNING

The kitchen table is mockingly empty.  No bread.  Not even a

crumb.  Maurice, dressed for work, eyes the table with great

resolve.  He rubs his hands together ceremoniously.

                    MAURICE

          I can do this.

Maurice moves to the fridge and gets out two eggs, onions,

green peppers and mushrooms.

CLAUDE is chirping INCESSANTLY FROM THE HALL.

The pile teeters precariously in Maurice's arms as he moves

the bottom pan from the cabinet --

BEDROOM

Ellen is seated in bed, arms crossed -- equal resolve in her

face.  A LARGE METALLIC CRASH OF POTS ECHOES FROM DOWNSTAIRS.

Ellen grabs her robe.

HALLWAY

Ellen gently takes Claude out of his cage.  She kisses him.

The bird, once frantic, instantly at peace.

                    ELLEN

              (whispering)

          You missed mommie... worried when I

          didn't come down... my baby... so

          sweet.

Ellen feeds the bird as she peeks around the corner, careful

not to be seen.  Maurice is desperately trying to cook an out

of control omelette.  It spills over the sides and SIZZLES on

the range top.  He tries to scoop it up with the pan, tilting

it further -- further -- the entire omelette slides onto the

range.  Maurice frantically tries to wrangle it back in.  Man

vs. Egg.  Man losing.

Ellen has to keep herself from laughing.  Her expression

changes to pity as she watches the chaos unfold.

INT.  BAKERY - MORNING

Ellen scrutinizes a new three loaves of raisin bread.

                    ELLEN

Angelo smiles and packages the chosen loaf.

INT.  KITCHEN - MORNING

A defeated Maurice is eating an apple.  He looks up with

surprise as Ellen walks into the kitchen from the back door,

a bag under her arm.  She glances at him and then moves to

the counter where she prepares the bread for serving.  Ellen

looks down into the trash to find the rebellious omelette

sitting uneaten.

The bread gets laid out in its usual basket, in its usual

manner.  Maurice says nothing as Ellen pulls two eggs from

the fridge and cracks them on a sizzling pan with expert

ease.

                    ELLEN

          Onions?

Maurice smiles warmly at his wife's back before moving to her

and hugging her from behind.  He whispers in her ear.

                    MAURICE

          Why do you put up with me?

Beat.

                    ELLEN

          Love... has something to do with

          it.

Maurice reaches over and turns off the stove.  He then turn

Ellen around and kisses her long and hard.  Ellen pulls away

gently and stares into his eyes.  Maurice looks very

emotional.

                    MAURICE

          I do love you... very, very much.

                    ELLEN

          Show me.

                    MAURICE

              (with all his heart)

          I will -- I promise.

Ellen kisses Maurice and returns to the eggs.  Maurice

continues to hug her from behind.  The MORNING SUN pours into

the kitchen covering Ellen and Maurice in a golden bath.

INT.  EMPTY STORE - AFTERNOON

A large black man wearing a dress shirt, sleeves rolled up to

the elbows TURNS ON a switch.  A SET OF TUBE LIGHTS FLICKER

TO LIFE.

CARL STONE leads Maurice out to the main room which is

presently a cob-web infested, barren space with a few

discarded packing boxes left in the corners.

Maurice runs his fingertips against the wall.

                    MAURICE

          History and the arts will be

          here...

His hand makes a grand swirl pointing to another area.  He

says the next two words with great awe as if he was saying

something holy.

                    MAURICE

          The Classics...

Carl watches curiously as Maurice walks around in a trance.

He moves to the bay window that over looks the street.

                    MAURICE

          We'll have a hand-painted sign...

              (another grand swirl)

          ... Parker Books.

Maurice's already bright eyes, brighten even more as he spots

the security guard strolling up and down the front of the

jewelry store.  The guard catches his stare and waves.

Maurice is aglow... He turns to Carl.

                    MAURICE

          This is my dream... it's finally

          here.

Carl has to smile -- rarely does he see someone so happy.

INT.  OFFICE ROOM - AFTERNOON

We are in Carl's cramped upstairs office... just enough room

to walk amongst the file cabinets.

Maurice holds his pen over the documents before him.

                    MAURICE

          I wish my wife were here.  She

          should see this...

              (stalling)

          She had a doctors appointment in

          Blue Bell.  That's a one and a half

          hour drive.  Ellen's been going to

          that doctor since she moved to

          Pennsylvania...

                    CARL

              (understanding)

          We could do this tomorrow?

                    MAURICE

          Ellen gave me strict orders to sign

          it... We invited some friends over

          -- you see, for a celebration.

Carl smiles patiently, he's seen this before.

Maurice gathers his strength as he puts pen to paper... He

scribbles his signature quickly and let's the pen drop to the

table top as if all the energy drained from his body.  He

looks up to Carl with powerful eyes.

                    MAURICE

          Every journey begins with one step

          right?

Beat.

                    CARL

          Enjoy your party Mr. Parker... Your

          new store will be waiting for you

          Monday morning.

Carl and Maurice shake hands like best friends.

INT.  HOUSE - NIGHT

A wine chiller sits proudly on the coffee table.  The SOUNDS

OF LIGHT CONVERSATION float through the room.  About ten

friends and family have gathered.

Maurice sits on the sofa nearest the window.  He's listening

to the drone of TED PRICE.

Ellen is not present.

                    TED

          ... So she says the "L" word, after

          two dates, the "L" word!  She says

          'Don't you believe in true love?

          Love that can conquer all?'  I say,

          'Whoa, hold on.  Just so we're

          clear on things, I think love these

          days is shit.  It don't mean a

          thing and it don't stand for

          nothing.  Shit.'... You know what

          she says, 'Fine, but how do you

          feel about kids?'

Everyone near the SOFA LAUGHS.  A CAR LIGHT DANCES ON THE

CURTAINS... Maurice quickly pulls the curtain aside and

watches as the car pulls past the house and around the

corner.  Maurice turns back from the window hiding his

concern and without missing a beat...

                    MAURICE

          It's nice to see you don't have any

          scars from your divorce.

This brings on another ROUND OF LAUGHTER.

THE TELEPHONE RINGS.

Maurice rises from his seat -- but is waved off by ADELLE

MATLIN who picks up the phone right away.  Adelle is

Maurice's niece, early thirties, very attractive and always

smiling -- except at this moment.

Ted begins another one of his stories -- the words are

incoherent as Maurice watches Adelle carefully... Adelle

turns her back to the room as she talks and then DISAPPEARS

into the kitchen stretching the phone cord around the

doorway... Something is definitely wrong.

Maurice steadies his gaze at the door of the kitchen...

eternal seconds pass before Adelle appears again.  She looks

different -- ghostly.  She glances up for a fraction of a

second locking eyes with her uncle -- she immediately looks

away.

Maurice watches Adelle move to her husband GERALD and

whispers in his ear.  Gerald changes instantly -- taking on

the same ghostly transformation -- his eyes dart to Maurice.

Ted's story is cut off as Maurice speaks LOUDLY...

                    MAURICE

          What's wrong?

The room goes SILENT as all eyes fall on Adelle and Gerald.

                    GERALD

              (shaking)

          Maurice, can we go into the dining

          room?

Beat.

                    MAURICE

          What's happened to my wife?

This hits everyone in the room like a bomb.  A dread hangs

over every passing second... Gerald crumbles under the

moment... Adelle begins to cry.

                    GERALD

          There was a car accident... Drunk

          driver.

Some of the crowd reacts.  A women covers her mouth.  The

moment is unbearable.

                    MAURICE

              (to himself)

          Please God -- don't do this.

Gerald cracks -- the tears start to flow from his eyes.

                    GERALD

          Maurice, it was serious... I don't

          know how to --

Gerald buries his face into the heels of his palms as if

trying to contain an explosion in his head.

                    GERALD

          Oh Jesus, please help me... She

          didn't... Ellen didn't make it...

          Ellen's dead Maurice.

Maurice closes his eyes shut tightly... like a child scared

of the dark.

Adelle blacks out, knocking over the wine chiller on the way

to the ground.  In less than a minute the room has

transformed from a celebration to a mourning.  Everyone is

frozen staring at Maurice for their cue... A child in her

mother's arms begins to cry as if aware of the circumstances.

EXTREME CLOSE UP.  Maurice opens his eyes slowly.  The room

stays still as Maurice stares at Ellen's HAT sitting on the

piano.

A "FTD" Florist truck pulls up.  A delivery man, moves with

an extravagant bouquet of flowers to the front door.  He

RINGS THE DOOR BELL.  No answer.  KNOCKS.  No answer.

The delivery man looks to the ground and searches, before

placing the bouquet on the porch.

WE NOW SEE that the porch is completely covered with flowers,

bouquets and wreaths.  The delivery man tip-toes his way

through the maze of condolences and moves to his truck.

Maurice sits in a chair facing Ellen's wardrobe closet.  The

LIGHTS IN THE ROOM ARE OFF.  The room is lit only by the

LIGHT FROM THE HALLWAY STREAMING IN AT AN ANGLE.

Maurice gets up and with a great deal of uncertainty, opens

the closet.  Maurice stares at the collection of hanging

dresses.

He reaches out and pulls the cloth of a floral dress towards

him... He closes his eyes and smells the cloth... his face

tightens in pain... both hands cling to the dress tightly...

he tries desperately, can't fight it -- Maurice Parker begins

to cry.

His hands grab frantically at the rest of the dresses --

pressing them to his face and chest.

                    MAURICE

          Oh God... I'm sorry Ellen... I'm so

          sorry...

He hugs the dresses as if they were her.  His weeping turns

to a torturous wail of grief... all the love, all the anger

spilling out in this one moment.

He falls to the ground yanking all the dresses down with him

-- they collapse atop him... He buries his face in his wife's

clothes...

The MUFFLED SOUND OF HIS CRIES ECHOES through the lonely

house.

PARK BENCH

Maurice is seated on a park bench.  Across from him is an

ELDERLY COUPLE -- in their seventies.  The OLD WOMAN is frail

with tiny eyes that disappear when she smiles.  The husband

is a skinny man with a baseball hat that makes him look like

a little boy.

Maurice watches them silently as they sit and hold hands...

Their warm laughs and whispered conversations stinging him.

He watches as the old man gets up.  The old woman tries to

make him stay, but he playfully pulls away.  She shakes her

head like a shy school girl as the old man walks back down

the path by himself.

The old woman glances Maurice's way.

                    OLD WOMAN

          Good morning.

                    MAURICE

          Good morning.

The old woman glances at the empty baby carriage standing

next to the bench.

                    OLD WOMAN

          Is it a boy or a girl?

                    MAURICE

          Oh, that's not mine.

Maurice gestures to the woman and baby who are sitting on a

blanket in the grass.

                    MAURICE

          I don't have kids.

                    OLD WOMAN

          You should.  Children are a

          blessing from God.  I have four.

The old woman studies him.

                    OLD WOMAN

          Are you okay?

Beat.

                    MAURICE

          Is that your husband?

She nods, "Yes."

          You look so happy -- how long have

          you been married?

                    OLD WOMAN

          Forty-seven years.

This hits Maurice hard.

                    OLD WOMAN

          Are you married?

This hits Maurice even harder.

                    MAURICE

              (this is painful)

          Yes... Seventeen years.

The old woman looks down the path for her husband.

                    MAURICE

          Where did he go?

                    OLD WOMAN

          He's getting my sweater from the

          car.  I said there was a breeze.

              (shaking her head)

          I told him not to go.

Beat.

                    MAURICE

          May I ask you a question that might

          sound strange?

                    OLD WOMAN

          Yes.

Beat.

                    MAURICE

          How do you know he loves you?

The old woman looks at him oddly.

                    MAURICE

          I mean besides... time -- how did

          you know ten years ago -- twenty

          years ago?

She thinks hard... tough question.  No answer for a moment

then --

The old woman sees something out of the corner of her eye --

her husband is walking up the path with her white lace

sweater over his arm...

She smiles as the answer comes to her.

                    OLD WOMAN

          Because he shows me... he's not

          much for words, but he shows me.

Maurice sits back -- her answer lingers in the air like a

haunting voice.

Maurice watches as the old man comes back and drapes his wife

with the sweater.  The old woman waves as they continue down

the path... hand in hand.

                    MAURICE

          Pardon?

                    DR. ROYCE

          I mean why the sudden voluntary

          visit  -- usually it takes gun-

          point to get you in here...

                    MAURICE

          Routine, I assure you.  I just

          Yes -- you are.

                    MAURICE

          I'm going to ask you a question

          that may sound peculiar.

Dr. Royce folds his arms and waits... What's this all about?

          How far could an individual walk if

          they had no athletic training --

          you understand, just an ordinary

          person?

Dr. Royce stares at him suspiciously.

          I know what you're getting at.

                    MAURICE

          You do?

                    DR. ROYCE

          I've seen it before.

                    MAURICE

          You have?

                    DR. ROYCE

          You're feeling old and you want to

          start exercising.  A lot of men

          your age feel the need to recapture

          their youth.  Don't feel

          embarrassed about it.

                    MAURICE

              (playing along)

          Okay.

                    DR. ROYCE

          You should start slow and easy --

          fifteen minutes a day.

                    MAURICE

          No.  How far in one attempt --

          what's the farthest someone like

          myself could walk?

The doctor is confused again.

                    MAURICE

          Just for curiosity sake that's all?

                    DR. ROYCE

          I don't know -- maybe twenty

          miles... Of course I'm not

          recommending that... if someone

          like you had to I mean... that's

          how far they'd probably get before

          encountering serious physical

          walls.

          Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take

          you more than five days if you just

          stop to sleep and eat.

                    MAURICE

          By car right?

Joselle scrunches her face in exaggerated shock and takes a

step back to look Maurice up and down.

                    JOSELLE

          How else you gonna get there on the

          ground?

Maurice gives her a sad expression.  If she only knew.

INT.  NEW STORE - DAY

The future Parker Books.  The room sits as empty and barren

as before.

Maurice sits on the floor against the far wall.  He stares at

his new store.  His gaze turns to the window where the guard

strolls by.  The guard doesn't notice him.

Maurice looks terrible, his eyes red and framed by bags...

his skin a yellowish white.

He moves to his feet and TURNS OFF THE LIGHTS.

INT.  BOOKSTORE - AFTERNOON

Kris unloads the last of a shipment of books.  He moves to

Maurice who sits by the window to the street.  Maurice points

to a chair across from him and Kris takes a seat.

                    MAURICE

          Why do you want to be a journalist

          Kris?  What sparked your interest?

Beat.

                    KRIS

          I want to reach people.  Nobody

          listens to me.  This is my way to

          reach them.

                    MAURICE

          To reach people, you have to feel

          something first... You write about

          the wrong things.  How can you feel

          for dog food?  The people at the

          Gazette don't respect it, and

          neither do you.

                    KRIS

          This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever

          happens.

                    MAURICE

          Write from your heart.  That's why

          the classics are great.

Beat.

                    KRIS

          Why are you telling me this Mr.

          Parker?

Maurice looks out the window and picks up an envelope from

the coffee table between them.  He hands it to Kris.

                    MAURICE

          Your bus is arriving.

Kris opens the envelope and finds money.

                    MAURICE

          It's one month's pay.

Kris gets up.  A shock of adrenaline hits him.

                    KRIS

          Are you firing me?

                    MAURICE

          No.  No... I won't be here for a

          while.  The store will be closed in

          the interim.

Kris grabs his coat, shifting his attention between the

window and Maurice?

                    KRIS

          You going on a trip Mr. Parker?

                    MAURICE

          Yes.

                    KRIS

          Where?

                    MAURICE

          California.

Kris moves to the door.

                    KRIS

          That's cool.  What day are you

          arriving?

Beat.

                    MAURICE

          I'm not sure -- sometime in January

          I think.

Kris stops cold.  The door to the street half-open.

                    KRIS

          When are you leaving?

                    MAURICE

          Tomorrow.

Kris is seriously confused now.  Maurice decides to end the

confusion.

                    MAURICE

          I'm walking there Kris.

                    KRIS

          Walking where?

                    MAURICE

          California.

Kris' jaw hits the floor as the bus pulls to a stop across

the street.  Kris pulls up his sleeve and glances at his

forearm.

                    KRIS

          The hairs on my arm are standing

          up... Something strange is

          happening.

                    MAURICE

          I always knew you had good

          instincts...

          Goodbye Kris.  I'll see you when I

          get back.

Kris hesitates before darting out of the store, across the

street and into the bus.  Kris takes a seat in the back and

digs into his bag and pulls out the tape recorder.  CLICK.

heading down the block.

The sign reads:  CLOSED - OWNER OUT OF TOWN.

The house is eerily silent.

Three things lay on the dining table.  A shoulder bag filled

with clothes.  A carrying bag with personals.  And a set of

maps.

Maurice checks the locks on all windows... He places all the

food in the refrigerator into a trash bag... He pulls out a

drawer and loosens a side panel, a wad of money flops out.

Maurice pockets the bills...

Maurice walks through the hall with a portable cage.  He

stops before Claude's hanging cage... no movement, no

chirping.  Maurice stares emotionally for a moment before

reaching in and carefully removing CLAUDE'S LIFELESS BODY

from the bottom of the cage.  Maurice looks down at the lost

pet in his hands.

begins to speak but is caught off guard by YOUNG ELLEN'S

beautiful features.  Maurice manages a few words.

Ellen places the soda she had at her side on the table.

Maurice is completely flustered.

Ellen places her hand out.  Maurice grabs it instinctively

and shakes.

Ellen looks at the full table of books.

worried expression on his face.

          I need to show her how much I love

          her Kris.

                    KRIS

          Why know?

                    MAURICE

          Because I should have shown her

          before... Everyday, I should have

          shown her.

Kris tries to act calm, but it doesn't last long.

          Shit Mr. Parker.  You can't walk

          across the United States -- it's

Maurice takes his time with the response.  Kris waves more

cars to pass them.

          Ellen got up every morning and went

          to the corner store to get me my

kept English Loafers could be mistaken for trash now.

Maurice rubs his barefeet with both hands -- grimacing from

the pain.  The tub is almost filled.  Maurice stops the tap.

The steam from the water fills the room.

Maurice raises his legs with great effort and submerges each

leg into the steaming water.  His eyes close with great

relief as his body melts into the tub.  Maurice lays his head

on the side of the tub... It only takes ten seconds before

Maurice's SNORING fills the bathroom.

Maurice looks back the way he came -- a second of

indecision... the moment passes.

Maurice takes a deep breath before moving to the CRUSHED COKE

CAN.  He moves to the exact spot where he left the road the

night before and begins walking again...

The elevator BELL dings, letting off a cargo of newspaper

Frank and Seth come to their corner and stop before a young

man, Phillies cap turned backwards, sitting behind an IBM 486

DX... fingers flying over the keyboard.

                    FRANK

          Someone's got a hot story.

Kris Reddy keeps typing.  He spits out the answer after a few

seconds.

          Five... Couldn't sleep.

stares up with a smile.

EXT.  STREET - DAY

Maurice as he walks down a winding highway.  His new sneakers

shuffling slowly.

A SHARP PAIN SHOOTS UP MAURICE'S LEG.  His knees buckle.  The

shoulder bags tumble to the ground followed by Maurice

himself.  From a distance it looks like he's been shot.

Maurice grabs the back of his thigh and tries to straighten

his leg out... His face frozen in a painful expression.

Maurice rubs his legs slowly -- working the cramp out.  He

relaxes a bit as he finally straightens his leg.  Maurice

sits there motionless -- eyes glazed... defeated.

The SOUNDS OF A BIRD snap him out of his trance.  He looks up

to see a PAINTED BUNTING, a bird about six inches in height

FLY DOWN from a tree and land on a rock next to him.  Maurice

stares at the beautiful bird curiously.  Its body splashed

with brilliant blues, reds and greens.  It looks out of place

in these mundane surroundings.  Maurice looks around the

skies to see no other birds.  The Painted Bunting chirps a

few times before taking flight into the air.  It circles over

Maurice before disappearing behind the trees.

Maurice smiles.  He pulls himself to his feet with great

effort.

Maurice opens all of his bags and begins emptying the

essentials -- the maps, food, a canister of water.

Maurice reloads one bag and pulls it over his shoulder with

great effort.  At his feet, are the rest of his belonging --

piled on the side of the road.

Maurice painfully begins walking again.

WE PULL BACK on Maurice's figure walking on the highway...

the pile of disregarded things laying by the side... The

highway is endless... winding it's way for miles and miles

into a fixed dot in the distance.

          What is it?

She stares silently at the paper laid out on the table.  The

headline beams at her:

Adelle is shocked.  She gazes at an old picture of her uncle

printed underneath the headline.

She STORMS off into the kitchen with the golden pancakes.

          Sergeant, I'm a psychologist and I

          know the difference between normal

          clearly display psychological

          problems... My uncle lost his wife

          and it devastated him.

          We're very sorry about that.  Some

          of our men were on the scene of the

          accident.

                    ADELLE

          I think my uncle is suffering from

          a condition called Mania which is

          linked with depression.  It is a

          time when an individual will act

          over-confident, and will act out

          impractical, grandiose plans.

          Sometimes these plans can be

          dangerous.

          A couple days to a few months if

          untreated.

Dally digests this information.

                    DALLY

          Look, I'll see if anyone has

          spotted him recently.  If I get any

          information, I'll call you.

          Thank you.

Adelle looks very emotional... on the verge of tears.

          What if something happens to one of

Maurice loses his hard demeanor and moves next to her.  He

lays his hand across her shoulder.

eyes and a tear rolls down her cheek.  He takes a deep

breath.

about ten feet past them when he stops, hesitates and then

heads back to them.

                    MAURICE

          Excuse me, who's truck is this?

The man sitting on the hood of the truck, has dark hair and

hasn't shaven in days.  This unfortunate gentleman is named

DENNY.

Denny gives Maurice a greasy curious look.  He squints his

glazed eyes.

          Yes we are.  Who the fuck are you?

Maurice, doesn't look scared, in fact he looks angered.

          You don't know me from Adam, but I

          want you to do something for me.  I

          want you to wait until you sobered

          up before you get behind the wheel.

          I know this is out of the ordinary,

          but one man to another, would you

          do me that favor?

Silence.  Then everyone in the group BURSTS OUT IN DRUNKEN

LAUGHTER.

          No, I just don't want anybody dying

          because I didn't say something when

          I had the chance.

Denny's face goes blank.  No emotion.  His steady gaze almost

terrifying.

                    DENNY

          I'll drive my truck shit-faced if I

          want to.  You better turn around

          and walk away preacher.  You don't

          know who you're talking to.

Maurice practically hobbles his way down a road lined by

towering pines.  He stops to take a drink from his canister

and keeps walking.  The SOUNDS OF A CAR GROW IN THE DISTANCE.

Maurice doesn't turn his back.

The CANARY YELLOW TRUCK pulls over the ridge with a load full

of passengers.  It gains distance on Maurice.

Maurice hears the ENGINE and waves HIS ARM IN THE AIR --

signaling for it to pass him.  Maurice walks ten more feet

before turning around.

Maurice's face instantly changes when he sees the demented

grins through the windshield of the truck.  Maurice turns and

quickens his pace... The truck picks up pace... Maurice

breaks into a run... The truck speeds up, passes Maurice and

stops in front of him.

Panic fills Maurice as he watches the truck unload it's

drunken passengers.  Eyes scan the forest on either side for

a way out.  Maurice decides to stand his ground.

                    MAURICE

          This is Indiana -- nothing's going

          to happen to you.

          You need a ride, Preacher?

The men walk up to Maurice.

                    MAURICE

          No thank you I'll walk.

A tall lanky gentleman gestures to Maurice's shoulder bag

with his beer can.  Some beer sprays Maurice's feet with the

gesture.

          is this preacher guy?  Coming up to

          me and my friends?  Looking like he

          wanted to kick my ass for drinking?

Denny gives Maurice that inhuman stare.  Maurice is clearly

frightened.

                    DENNY

          Then I figured it.  You're angry.

          You lost somebody, because some

          asshole was drinking.

Maurice is frozen.

                    DENNY

          Maybe you lost a son?  A sister?  A

          wife?

Maurice looks up for a millisecond.  Denny doesn't miss it.

                    DENNY

          A wife?... Did someone piss drunk

          run into your wife?  Crushed her

          like a bug.  Snapped her bones?

                    MAURICE

          That's enough.

Maurice is red with anger.  Denny loves it.

                    DENNY

          Oh the preacher's getting angry

          again...

              (Denny goes ice cold)

          Tell me something.  Did she die

          instantly or did she feel every

          torn muscle and shattered bone?

          Were you there to help her?  Or

          were you safe at home when the

          windshield sliced into her face --

                    MAURICE

          I'll kill you!

Maurice swings.  Denny easily avoids it.  Maurice doesn't see

the first BLOW COMING, IT HITS HIM IN THE CHEST -- Maurice

gasps for air as he buckles to the dirt.  Hands grab --

restrain.  A POWERFUL KICK IN THE RIBS -- ANOTHER...

LAUGHTER... ANOTHER SET OF VICIOUS KICKS... The road and

forest begin to spin... A PAINFUL SLASH ACROSS HIS FACE...

Maurice prepares for the next blow... it never comes.  RED

AND BLUE lights swirl... Maurice looks up, barely focusing --

a man leans over a car door... The image becomes clearer -- a

POLICEMAN stands poised -- gun aimed directly at the men

hovering over him.

                    POLICE OFFICER

          Step away from him now!

Gesturing to a young officer at another desk to come over.

Dally, cups the phone.

The sea of desks are empty.  One empty desk is lit -- Kris

Reddy's desk.  THE CRACKLE OF A SHORTWAVE/C.B. UNIT FLOATS

THROUGH THE LARGE UNOCCUPIED ROOM from an adjacent room.  The

VOICES OF DALLY AND OFFICER GREY ARE DISTORTED BUT AUDIBLE.

WE MOVE TO the back room to find Kris writing furiously in

front of an elaborate C.B. setup.

He jots down the words as fast as they're said:

  "Maurice Parker... Elkhart... Route 80... Precinct 18..."

The transmission gets cut as the phone conversation ends.

Kris quickly rolls the chair across the room and grabs a map

off the shelf.

The map gets pinned under two coffee cups and a ceramic frog

as Kris traces the route from Philadelphia to Indiana... He

sits up straight in astonishment as his eyes hit the KEY of

the map.

                    KRIS

          Jesus -- he's walked six hundred

          miles.

Kris glances at the hairs on his arm and smiles.

EXT.  INDIANA POLICE STATION - MORNING

Maurice and Officer Grey are seated on the front stairs of

the precinct drinking coffee when ADELLE MATLIN DRIVES UP.

Adelle steps out of a RENTED TOYOTA CELICA.  Her tense --

frightened eyes betray her mental state for the past ten

hours.  She walks to the stairs.

                    GREY

          Mrs. Matlin... good morning.

Maurice slowly gets up.  Adelle is in shock as she looks at

the stranger before her.

Maurice stands in a 'COLTS' football T-shirt, faded jeans and

sneakers.  His left cheek is black and blue, and his arm and

side are bandaged.

                    ADELLE

          Uncle Maurice, you're wearing

          sneakers?

                    MAURICE

          High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with

          heel support and air-cushioned

          soles.  They're nasty.

Adelle wasn't sure what that meant.  She shakes it off and

hugs Maurice.  She is visibly relieved to have him in her

arms.

                    GREY

          My shift ended an hour ago.

Adelle notices the ROSE in Grey's hand.  Grey catches her

glance.

                    GREY

          It's for my wife.

                    ADELLE

          What's the occasion?

Grey looks to Maurice -- they exchange a knowing smile.

                    GREY

          No occasion.

Adelle notices the WINK exchanged between Grey and Maurice.

                    GREY

          You can use the conference room, if

          you want to talk.

                    ADELLE

          That won't be necessary.

                    GREY

          Fine.

                    ADELLE

          We can talk on the way back -- I

          rented a car.

Beat.

                    MAURICE

          It'll be kind of hard to talk,

          since you'll be in the car and I

          won't.

Adelle gives Maurice an angry glare -- Maurice holds his

ground.

          And your store?  What about your

          new store?  What about all your

          dreams?

                    MAURICE

          I have new dreams now.

                    ADELLE

          I don't accept that.

                    MAURICE

          Maybe one day -- after you've been

          married twenty years you'll

          understand.

                    ADELLE

          Uncle Maurice -- I spent all our

          frequent flyer miles on a one way

          ticket here... I have a rented car

          outside, just listen to me.

              (beat)

          Come back with me now, and if you

          still want to do something like

          this in a year -- maybe we'll plan

          a car trip across the country --

          Gerald and I will come along --

                    MAURICE

          I have to walk -- by myself -- all

          the way -- every inch.

                    ADELLE

          It's impossible.

                    MAURICE

          It's what she asked for... It's

          what I'm going to do.

                    ADELLE

          She was being symbolic.  What if

          she asked you to fly to the moon?

                    MAURICE

          You'd be visiting me at Nasa.

Adelle changes gears.  She takes a seat next to Maurice and

studies his legs and tired face carefully before uttering the

words.

                    ADELLE

              (whispering)

          What if you don't make it?

                    MAURICE

          I'll make it.

                    ADELLE

          If you really want to do this...

          plan it out.  Rest up.  Train for

          it.  Build up your body.  Plan

          every stop along the way.  How much

          money?  Time?  Really do it

          properly.  This is all so -- by the

          seat of your pants.

                    MAURICE

          No it's not.

                    ADELLE

          Why did you take the back roads

          here?  They're not safe.  You'd

          know that if you'd planned.

Beat.

                    MAURICE

          I've all ready gone six hundred

          miles... I can't do it again.

                    ADELLE

          If you can't redo these six hundred

          miles when you're rested and ready,

          how are you possible going to walk

          another two thousand-five hundred

          miles in your present condition?

Maurice is stumped.  He looks unsure.  He instantly looks on

the verge of tears.

                    MAURICE

          Nothing's going to happen.

                    ADELLE

          Uncle, the way I was told, if that

          police car didn't happen down that

          road, you would be dead right now.

          That guy Denny, had jumped bail in

          another state, he's dangerous...

          They'll be other Dennys, if you

          don't plan.

Maurice stares down at the table -- the life draining from

him with every word she says.

                    ADELLE

          Ellen, deserves you to do this

          right.  Really make it -- if you're

          going to do it.  She deserves it.

          Do you want this?  It's a long

Maurice is stretched out in the back -- his legs propped up

on a blanket.  Maurice shakes his head "no" silently.

His sad eyes watching the passing scenery.  The speeding car

swallows up the miles effortlessly.  Maurice watches the

Jackson Liquor Wholesalers whiz by... The painful hills he

climbed, gone, in an instant... The school where he watched

the children being dropped off, swishes by in a blink... all

those miles lost.

Maurice shuts his eyes in pain.

Maurice is seated in the back staring out at the eighteen

Maurice's dull eyes are about to shut when something catches

his attention.  He sits up and stares out the window with

great intensity.  Maurice watches as a large truck pulls into

the parking lot, across it's side in blazing red --

          "Jackson Liquor Wholesalers - Since 1945"

Maurice scans the area... gas station ATTENDANTS... A BEARDED

HOMELESS MAN laying next to a heating unit... KIDS eating

fast food on old picnic tables...

Maurice's gaze steadies on the TRUCK, as the driver fills the

tank with gas.

          I know, but by that time I'll have

          gotten him some treatment... I just

          want to get back home before he

          changes his mind.

          You want something to eat?

She stares at Maurice covered in a blanket with his back to

her... an unresponsive blob.

                    ADELLE

          I know you're feeling a lot of

          emotions right now.  It's okay to

          be mad.  It's okay to feel

          helpless.  It's part of the healing

          process.  I understand.  I do.

Adelle puts the Celica into drive and pulls out onto the

highway.

A tired Adelle slips out of the car and hugs Gerald.

                    ADELLE

          He was exhausted -- slept the whole

          way.

Adelle and Gerald move to the back door of the Celica.  They

open it and stare at Maurice covered by the blanket.  Adelle

shakes the blanket.

                    ADELLE

          Uncle Maurice we're home... Uncle

          Maurice.

Adelle shakes Maurice, who stirs a little as he wakes.  His

feet slide out from under the blanket -- Adelle stares

curiously at the ARMY COMBAT BOOTS that dangle out.

                    ADELLE

          Uncle Maurice?

Adelle pulls aside the covers... THE HOMELESS MAN, from the

gas station, sits up.  ADELLE'S SHRILL SCREAM BLASTS THROUGH

bearded man struggles out of the car and looks around the

quiet neighborhood.

                    HOMELESS MAN

          So this is the City of Brotherly

Maurice back on the road.  His limp only slightly visible at

this point in the day.  The bandages rubbing him with every

step.

The highway takes him around a beautiful bend of trees.  THE

AIR IS FILLED WITH THE SOUNDS OF BIRDS.  Maurice spots a

YELLOW WARBLER, a striking bird about eight inches long with

vivid yellow feathers.  It sits elegantly on a nearby branch.

He walks towards it -- it stays in position.  Closer.  The

bird chirps back at him.  Maurice is within arms reach of the

bird.

                    MAURICE

          Ellen would have loved you.

Maurice looks closer -- and notices it's wings.  The feathers

bend back -- a dark area at the center.

                    MAURICE

          How did that happen?

Maurice watches the bird hop around the branch -- unable to

Ellen move to the sink and lay a motionless bird on the

counter.

                    ELLEN

              (shaky voice)

          It must've hit the window... I

                    MAURICE

          Don't bring it in here -- it

          probably has all kinds of diseases.

Ellen finds an eye dropper from the table and fills it with

water -- she lets a few drops fall into the birds mouth.

wrapped gently with a hand towel.  A morsel of food is

lowered into its mouth with a pair of tweezers.  The bird

stares blankly at the ceiling.

                    MAURICE

          It isn't going to make it Ellen.

          Let the poor thing go quietly.

          all of us.  You miss that don't

          you?  You miss playing with your

          I don't believe it.

Ellen hugs Maurice.

                    ELLEN

          All he needed was love.  Once you

          have that, you can do anything.

Young Maurice and Ellen watch the bird soar into the blue

Maurice carries the bird back to the trees.  He lays it back

          I received my B.S. from the

          University of Pennsylvania, my

          P.H.D. from Bryn Mawr College.  I

          worked three years at the Boston

          University School of Medicine,

          during which time I had articles

          printed in the "Journal of

          Educational Psychology", "American

          Journal of Psychology", "Psychology

          Review" and "Science"... So I think

          it's safe to say my opinion is

          valid.

Gerald brings the sizzling pan over and divides the steaming

dish into both plates.

                    ADELLE

          Look, please find him for me...

          Officer, I tried... but I brought

          back the wrong person.

Gerald quickly scoops some rice onto both plates.  His mouth

is watering as he goes for the utensils.

Adelle abruptly stands at her place.

                    ADELLE

          Stop laughing!

Gerald gets into his seat at the table just in time to see

Adelle angrily hang up the phone.  She stares off into space

before unconsciously cleaning the table.  Adelle picks up

both plates of food...

                    GERALD

          Adelle --

Gerald's heart sinks as Adelle pops open the trash can with a

tap of her foot and dumps the picture perfect meal into the

garbage.  She goes to the sink and rinses the plates

completely preoccupied with her thoughts.  She mumbles to

herself as she shuts off the water.

                    ADELLE

          He says he admires him.

Adelle storms out of the kitchen.  Gerald sits at the empty

table with a fork in his hands.  He shakes his head in

disbelief.

EXT.  MIDWEST HIGHWAYS - DAY

The land is flat.  From the roads one can see endless fields

in all directions.  When the wind blows, the crops bend in

unison, changing the shape and texture of the land for a

moment and instantly changing back with a snap of the wind.

Maurice takes in the beauty of the land through a painful

grimace.  Occasionally clutching his right leg in moments of

extreme pain.

Maurice rests on an abandoned tractor by the side of the road

and watches the wind change the fields.  He closes his jacket

as the gusts become stronger.

HOTEL

The clock clicks past 11:30 am.  Maurice is still in bed --

the curtains drawn.  He crawls out from under the sheets and

downs two pills with a glass of water.  He looks bad.  His

face pale, his eyes at half-mast.  He wipes unnatural sweat

from his brow and melts into the bed again.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

STREET

Just after dusk.  A small town's main road.  Maurice quietly

passes under the street lights.

He stares up and tightens the hood on his parka as the first

SNOWFLAKE falls into the SHAFT OF THE STREET LIGHT.  Soon

thousands of flakes fall into the light...

GAZETTE BUILDING

Kris fields calls frantically as the LIGHTS BLINK ANXIOUSLY

on his phone.  The front page of the Gazette is posted on his

pin up board.  It reads... "HE MARCHES ON..."  Underneath is

A PICTURE of Maurice standing outside his bookstore holding

up THE BOOK SOCIETY MEDALLION proudly.

A teenage boy gets off the elevator and maneuvers an enormous

bag over his shoulder... emblazoned across his back are the

words "MAIL ROOM."  The boy comes to Kris and empties the bag

on Kris' desk without a word.  Hundreds of letters cascade

down swallowing the table top and covering Kris who stares in

awe as the letters keep coming.

MOTEL

Maurice is COUGHING PAINFULLY.  He crouches over the edge of

the bed and holds his side with every strain.

Maurice looks worse than ever.  His hair and shirt are soaked

with sweat.  The coughing attack stops.  Maurice take a

couple deep breaths before laying back down.

His feet are visible -- sticking out from beneath the sheets.

They look like someone has beaten them with a stick, swollen

and bruised.  They disappear under the sheets.

EXT.  STREET - DAY

Early morning.  The branches of the trees are encapsulated in

ice.  The snow piled ten inches on every surface.  Maurice,

buried deep beneath three layers of clothes, looks around.

His breath materializes with every step.  He forces a weak

smile at the magical landscape before him.  White.  Pure.

Peaceful.

The SOUNDS OF A VOLVO STATION WAGON urges Maurice to the side

of the road.  As it passes a little girl waves from the

passenger window.  Maurice puts on a brave face and waves

back.

Another CAR ENTERS the picture -- A DARK BLUE FIREBIRD rises

over the hill in the opposite lane moving fast, too fast.

SLOW-MOTION as the Firebird skids over the ice and the snow

-- the driver desperately trying to gain control... The

mother in the Volvo hits the BRAKES as the Firebird spins

into her lane... Maurice yells out.

                    MAURICE

          No!

The cars IMPACT with a sickening CRUNCH -- BACK TO REAL TIME:

The Firebird spins into a guardrail, breaking through it and

coming to a stop in a bank of snow.

The Volvo isn't so lucky.  It flips from the impact...

sliding on its roof, driving through the snow, down the

road... It comes to a rest a hundred feet away.

SILENCE.  STILLNESS.  The entire event took only seconds.

Maurice runs frantically after the Volvo.  The windows are

SHATTERED.  Snow has packed into the over-turned car.  No one

can be seen inside the vehicle.

Maurice kneels down and punctures the wall of snow with his

hand.  His arm disappears up to the shoulder.  His face

grimacing with the strain.  His arm comes out slowly...

A few MUFFLED SOBS ARE HEARD BEFORE the little girl breaks

through the wall of snow and slides out of the window.  She

lets out a DESPERATE GASP for air as Maurice pulls her out by

the wrist.

Maurice clears her mouth and face and watches as she coughs.

                    MAURICE

              (panting)

          It's okay.  It's all over.

Maurice lays her gently against a snow bank, before moving to

the other side of the car.

                    DRIVER (O.S.)

          Is she okay?

Maurice looks up to see the driver of the Firebird walking

towards him.  He looks dazed.

Maurice doesn't waste another second and plunges his arm in

the snow... deeper than before.  His cheek pressed against

the snow, almost laying flat on the ground.

                    MAURICE

              (frantic)

          Oh no... she's wearing a seat-belt.

Maurice fishes around... his teeth clenched... He lets out a

POWERFUL GRUNT as he pulls back with all his strength -- a

woman's WRIST appears first, then the tangled hair and then

the body spills out onto the road next to Maurice.

The driver appears over the Woman and Maurice and loses it

when he sees them.

                    DRIVER

          It wasn't my fault.  It wasn't my

          fault.

Maurice, out of breath, clears the woman's face and mouth --

no movement.  No sound.

                    MAURICE

          Come on... please...

Maurice holds her nose and breaths into her mouth...

                    MAURICE

          Please...

She doesn't respond.

                                                  CUT TO:

A FRIGHTENING FLASH

The mother's UNCONSCIOUS face turns into ELLEN.  Her lifeless

eyes -- her bruised cheek and forehead.  Her neck at an

awkward angle.  Maurice stares down at his wife in horror.

                    MAURICE

          No Ellen... don't die...

                                                  CUT TO:

THE MOTHER

being revived by Maurice.  He pushes her chest in counting...

push, count, breath... push, count, breath...

The mother's BODY TWITCHES, slightly at first -- then

obviously... The mother let's out a FEW PAINFUL COUGHS.

She takes a breath.  Life quickly returns to her body.

Maurice places her head in his lap and hugs her, lightly

rocking back and forth.  The tears streaming down his red

face.

                    MAURICE

          Everything's going to be fine

          Ellen.  I won't let anything happen

          to you.  I love you sweetie.

          Everything's going to be different

          now.

The SCENE BACKS OUT as Maurice comforts this stranger in his

arms.

EXT.  ROAD - AFTERNOON

The police have descended on the scene.  Traffic has been

blocked off in both directions.  The LIGHT thrown by the

ambulances tints the snow and fields a THROBBING RED.

Maurice's face can be seen in the shadows of the backseat of

a police car.

OUTSIDE THE CAR

OFFICER HANSEN AND OFFICER TANDY converse.

                    HANSEN

          What's his story?

                    TANDY

          His name is Maurice.  He's dancing

          around everything else.

                    HANSEN

          Red flag, man.

                    TANDY

          If he's in trouble with the law --

          fine.  Not our problem.  He yanked

          two people from a car wreck, let's

          give him some space.

Hansen looks in at the drawn, exhausted face of Maurice

through the window.  Hansen opens the back door.

                    HANSEN

          Maurice, you need anything?  Which

          way were you headed?  We can drive

          you.

                    MAURICE

          No thank you officer.  I'll walk.

Hansen throws a sharp glance to Tandy.  Hansen turns back to

Maurice.

                    HANSEN

          Grub?  Food?  How about food?  Our

          dime at the local diner...

Maurice mulls this offer.

                    HANSEN

          Come on man, you're a hero.  In

          Nebraska we don't let hero's walk

          around with empty stomachs.

Beat.

                    MAURICE

          ... I need to be brought back here.

                    HANSEN

          Deal.

INT.  DINER - EVENING

The end of the meal.  Maurice sits in a booth across from

Hansen and Tandy.  They watch as Maurice coughs violently

into his napkin.

                    HANSEN

          You look like shit Maurice.

Maurice takes a couple strained breaths.

                    MAURICE

          Getting old.

                    TANDY

          How long have you been footing it

          Maurice?

Beat.

                    MAURICE

          Too long...

              (looks around)

          Excuse me gentlemen.

Maurice gets up and heads to the bathroom.  Hansen and Tandy

stare at Maurice's shoulder bag laying on his seat.

                    HANSEN

          Red flags man.

                    TANDY

          Not our problem.

                    HANSEN

          Why so vague?  Why so evasive?  He

          could be somebody hot.

                    TANDY

          Not our problem.

                    HANSEN

          It's going to look beautiful when

          he turns out to be that animal who

          paid a visit to the Steadman's

          house.

                    TANDY

          This guy's not a murderer.

                    HANSEN

          If he is, half the town has seen us

          take him out for dinner like a

          couple of jack-asses.

That makes Tandy think.

                    HANSEN

          If he's clean, he'll never know

          about it.

Tandy looks to the men's bathroom door.

                    TANDY

          Do it quick.

Hansen instantly reaches over and begins rummaging through

the shoulder bag.  Hansen pulls out a little folder.  He

opens the folder to reveal an old certificate.  Hansen shows

Tandy the worn piece of paper.

                    HANSEN

          A marriage certificate?  Who the

          hell carries their marriage

          certificate around?

                    TANDY

          Maurice and Ellen Parker... it was

          issued in Philly... Mr. Maurice

          Parker has come a long way from

          home.  Why?

Hansen returns the certificate and folder to the bag and

leaves the booth quickly.

Maurice returns to the table to find only Tandy seated.

Maurice sees Hansen in the phone booth at the far end of the

diner.

glances out the window to see a highway sign swish by in the

East?  Maurice looks around quickly at the passing scenery.

Hansen and Tandy exchange looks.

          Sure.

Hansen looks back to the road.  The drive continues in

WIND -- AND A METALLIC SLAM in quick succession shakes the

car.

The forest clears quickly into an open field.  Far in the

distance across the field of white is a small pointed

building standing alone.  The glow of a LIGHT can be seen

through the windows.

Maurice trudges through the deeper snow.  Stumbling many

times.  The frigid wind pushing him to his knees.  Maurice

A dimly lit cathedral.  Six foot six, FATHER BERCHMAN walks

down the center isle of the cathedral, through a cloth

curtain and into a

BACK ROOM

where Maurice is sitting in a chair wrapped in a blanket.

                    MAURICE

          What did they ask?

                    FATHER

          If I had seen you.  By the way I'm

          sorry about your wife.  They told

          me.

                    MAURICE

          Thank you... I'm sorry you had to

          lie.  It must have been difficult.

                    FATHER

          I asked the officers if you had

          committed some crime... If they had

          said 'yes', you would be speaking

          with them right now.

This is the father's own room.  Very sparse as one would

expect.  He moves to his bureau and retrieves some pills.

                    FATHER

          Take these, and if you're up to it,

          try to explain how it is you came

          to be sitting here.

Maurice follows the father's instructions and tightens the

blanket around his shoulders.

                    MAURICE

          I'm walking for my wife.

Beat.

                    FATHER

          To where?

                    MAURICE

          Pacifica, California.

                    FATHER

          From where?

                    MAURICE

          Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

                    FATHER

          I see.

Beat.  The father nods as if this is not shocking news.

                    FATHER

          Why?

                    MAURICE

          Do you believe a person's soul

          lives on after their death?

                    FATHER

          Most certainly.

                    MAURICE

          And that that soul takes part of

          the person they were on this earth

          with them.

                    FATHER

          That's a reasonable assumption.

                    MAURICE

          I don't want my wife's soul having

          any doubts.

                    FATHER

          Doubts?  About what?

                    MAURICE

          About my love for her.

The father nods with understanding as if everything became

very clear with that statement.

                    FATHER

          You don't have to prove anything to

          her.

                    MAURICE

          I'm not proving to her.  I'm

          showing her.  And I know I don't

          have to.  I want to.  I've

          realized, love is about giving.

          I'm alive, I can still give to her.

          I want to give her everything I

          can.

The father studies this stranger before him with great

admiration.

                    MAURICE

          There are some people, including

          those officers, that are trying to

          stop me.  They mean well.  But they

          don't understand.  I wouldn't

          either if I were them.

Maurice struggles with the last words.  He slumps back --

physically drained.

The father gets up and takes the empty glass of water from

Maurice's hands.

                    FATHER

          I want you to stay here a few days

          until you're better.  You're no use

          to your wife in this condition.

The father moves for the curtain.

                    MAURICE

          You think I'm crazy too.

The father turns and smiles warmly.

                    FATHER

          I have spent my life dedicated to

          love.  Love of God.  Love of

          humanity.  And here you are living

          through love.  Bathing in it.

          Using its strength, its magic, its

          ability to overcome any barrier...

          If you are crazy, I hope my

          insanity is not far off.

Maurice's eyes well up instantly.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  CHURCH - WESTERN HIGHWAY - DAY

Father Berchman wraps one powerful hand around a tiny silver

cross dangling from his neck.  The other hand waves high into

the air at the shrinking figure of Maurice Parker walking

through the snow.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

HIGHWAY

The long trek continues.  The black tar of the roads peek out

in spots as the SUN BEATS down on the flatlands.  Maurice

drapes his worn scarf around a melting snowman.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

RESTAURANT

We are looking inside a fancy Center-City Philadelphia

restaurant.  Adelle and Gerald are seated by an enormous bay

window.  A waiter comes to their table with their main

course.  Gerald watches the food being served with great

anticipation.

Gerald's eyes drift out the window to the magazine stand on

the sidewalk... He squints to see better.  Realization hits

hard... His eyes light up.  He looks to Adelle and back to

the magazine stand.

In a mad race for time, Gerald begins to devour the food on

his plate.  The waiter and Adelle watch him in shock.  Adelle

glances out the window.  Her eyes squint... then light up.

She jumps to her feet and grabs Gerald by the arm, a fork

full of food drops to his plate.  Gerald looks back at his

full plate longingly as Adelle pulls him out of the

restaurant.

The waiter looks out the window to the magazine stand.  He

squints.

                                                  CUT TO:

MAGAZINE STAND

The NEW YORK TIMES are hung like stockings around the border

of the stand.  On the front pages, a singular headline stands

out among the others:

                  "A JOURNEY OF THE HEART"

A large PHOTO OF MAURICE is next to the headline.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

DINER

A red-headed waitress slices a credit card through the

machine and waits... Green computer letters blink - "This

account has been closed."

The waitress returns with the card -- she shakes her head

"No" at Maurice who digs into his wallet for cash.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

MOTEL

Maurice slides two twenties across the counter to the motel

manager.  Maurice checks the remaining bills in his wallet...

only a few bills left.

In the motel room we find Maurice sitting over the edge of a

bed buckled over in a coughing attack.  It finally stops.

Maurice flops back to the pillows, completely drained.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

ROADS

The flatlands have vanished.  The roads now serpentine

through mountain ranges.

VIEW FROM THE MOUNTAIN RANGE; Maurice moves like a grain of

dust over the black line of the road.

Maurice rests every half mile.  He labors up every incline

with ultimate effort.  He braces himself with a branch

serving as a make due crutch.

Maurice spots a small town nestled in the arms of the

mountain range.  He begins the journey to rest.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

GROCERIES

Maurice pays for his food with the last few bills in his

wallet.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

ROAD

Another stick serves as a walking cane.  The multi layers of

clothes have been shed for a short-sleeve shirt.  Maurice

follows a dirt road that breaks free of the mountains and

into the open country again.

SUPERIMPOSE:  COALVILLE, UTAH... MILE 2,472

EXT.  DRIVEWAY - DUSK

A dust covered mailbox at the end of a long dirt driveway.

Maurice wipes the mailbox clean with his hand.  The name

emerges like an ancient inscription from beneath the mud...

"CALDWELLS."

                                                  CUT TO:

FRONT DOOR

Maurice tentatively moving to the front door.  His hand

instinctively clutches his empty stomach.

The wind blows gently.  Maurice shuts his eyes and takes a

deep breath.  He opens his eyes slowly to see a dinner table

being set.  Potatoes, gravy, fresh baked bread... floating

through the half open window to Maurice's thankful smile.

THE SOUNDS OF CHILDREN AND ADULTS CAN BE HEARD INSIDE.

The first LIGHT KNOCKS go unheard with all the commotion.

HARDER.  The door squeaks open.  Maurice puts on his best

smile... the door opens wider -- no one stands before him.

                    BOY (O.S.)

          Hi.

Maurice looks down to find an adorable little boy, black

hair, big eyes and an even bigger grin.  This is three year

old ISAAC CALDWELL.

                    MAURICE

          Well, hello.

                    ISAAC

          I'm Isaac... I'm three.

                    MAURICE

          I'm Maurice Parker... I'm much

          older than three.  Are your parents

          home?

Beat.  Isaac thinks.

                    ISAAC

          You know what, I can play baseball

          with my brothers when I'm bigger.

                    MAURICE

          Is that right?

                    ISAAC

          You know what... I'm just little

          now, but I'll be big soon.

                    MAURICE

          You'll probably be bigger than your

          brothers.

                    ISAAC

          Yeah!

Isaac is happy with this thought.

Maurice looks up as MRS. CALDWELL comes to the door.

                    MRS. CALDWELL

          Who are you talking to Isaac?

Mrs. Caldwell stops as she stares at Maurice.

                    MAURICE

          Hello, I'm Maurice Parker.  I'm

          just passing through and I need to

          conserve what little funds I

          have... I need some food and a roof

          to sleep under for one night... Now

          I don't look like much, but if

          there are any things that need to

          get done around the house --

Mrs. Caldwell doesn't listen, but instead yells behind the

door.

                    MRS. CALDWELL

          Dave... you're not going to believe

          who's here.

Maurice looks at her oddly.  MR. CALDWELL comes to the door;

his face lights up.

                    MRS. CALDWELL

          This is Maurice Parker -- the one

          walking for his wife.

Mr. Caldwell is completely floored.  So, for that matter is

Maurice.  Mr. Caldwell puts out his hand with awe.

                    MR. CALDWELL

          If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave

          Caldwell.  I do the copy for the

          anchor on the evening news down

          here.

                    MAURICE

          Evening News?

                    MR. CALDWELL

          We did a piece after your story ran

          in the New York Times.

Maurice is truly surprised.

                    MAURICE

          New York Times?

Mrs. Caldwell ushers Maurice in the doorway by the elbow.

                    MRS. CALDWELL

          Someone said they spotted you in

          town... Mr. Parker, you're a

          celebrity.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CALDWELL KITCHEN - NIGHT

The Caldwell family dinner... all twelve of them.  Ten

children talk and reach for food.  Maurice sits at the end

talking, enjoying and sharing.  Isaac sits next to him

proudly.  Maurice has blended in as another member of this

family.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CALDWELL GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT

An inviting room.  The kind prepared for visiting

grandmothers and grandfathers to stay in.

Maurice checks himself out in the mirror... his borrowed

pajamas fit nicely.

He moves to the window and stares at the moon lit

landscape... enormous, endless, dwarfing.

The rocking chair CREAKS as Maurice melts into it.  He rubs

his calves slowly, the pain evident in his face.  His head

leans back after a moment... on the verge of sleep.

The SOUND OF TINY FOOTSTEPS stirs him.  He looks to the

doorway to find Isaac standing quietly at the door in his

baseball P.J.s.

                    MAURICE

          I thought you were asleep.

                    ISAAC

          You know what... I remembered you

          were here and I woke up.

Isaac walks silently to Maurice... Tip-toeing all the way.

                    MAURICE

          Your parents would want you to be

          in bed.

                    ISAAC

          You tell stories?

                    MAURICE

          Oh no... I'm not good at that.

          Very bad in fact...

Too late.  Isaac climbs up into Maurice's lap with great

effort.  Maurice looks down at Isaac who waits patiently for

him to begin.

                    MAURICE

          I would be exceedingly boring.

Isaac waits.

                    MAURICE

          I don't do these type of things.

Isaac -- still waiting.

                    MAURICE

          See there are two kinds of people

          in this world.

              (beat)

          ... Just a short one okay?

Isaac gets in position, cradled in Maurice's arms.  Maurice

searches for something to say.

                    MAURICE

          There was a boy named Isaac who

          wanted to play baseball, but he was

          too small and no one would let him

          play... but he kept practicing by

          himself -- waiting... He went to

          every game and sat in the stands

          with his glove.

                    ISAAC

          You know what... maybe I ran onto

          the field and hit a home run.

                    MAURICE

          Who's telling this story?

Isaac points to Maurice.

                    MAURICE

          Good, now the team had this great

          big player -- Big Billy.  He was

          the best.  He had them in the World

          Super-Bowl-Championship of little

          kids baseball.  But right before

          the game, the second best player on

          the team was suspended because he

          played a prank on a nice man who

          owned a book store... When that boy

          grew up he was convicted on

          burglary charges and spent fifteen

          years in prison -- where he

          belongs.

Isaac didn't understand that last part.

                    MAURICE

          Anyway, Big Billy needed another

          player so he yelled into the

          stands.  'Who can play baseball?'

          And there was a little voice that

          yelled out, 'Me, I can play.'

          Everyone turned to see a little boy

          standing with a glove.

                    ISAAC

              (beaming)

          That's me.

                    MAURICE

          Right.  But everyone saw how small

          Isaac was and laughed... but not

          Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac

          carefully and then told him to join

          the game.  It came to the end of

          the game.  It was the eleventh or

          twelfth inning or whatever is the

          last inning of a game...

                    ISAAC

          Nine.

                    MAURICE

          Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was

          losing and he was on base.  That's

          when Isaac came up.  He could

          barely hold the bat... Big Billy

          winked at Isaac... The ball was

          pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard.

          It soared up and out over the

          stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac

          hit a home run and won the game.

          After the game, Isaac asked Big

          Billy why he let he play.  Big

          Billy smiled and said, I wasn't

          always Big Billy, I was Little

          Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy

          went off after the game and read a

          classic book together.  The end.

                    ISAAC

          You know what -- that was a really

          good story... Tell it again.

Maurice has to smile as Isaac looks up anxiously.

                    MAURICE

          There was a boy named Isaac who

          liked to play baseball...

WE BACK OUT as Maurice rocks back and forth in his chair.

Isaac falling asleep in his arms.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  CALDWELL DRIVEWAY - MORNING

The family dog "Max", scurries up and down with great

excitement.  Max can sense something big is happening.

The Caldwell clan, one and all has gathered at the end of

their driveway.  Maurice is escorted out by Isaac who clings

tightly to his hand.  Mr. Caldwell meets Maurice halfway and

pulls him aside.

                    MR. CALDWELL

          That's a nice watch.

Maurice looks down at his beat-up Seiko.

                    MR. CALDWELL

          I've always wanted a watch like

          that.

                    MAURICE

              (unstrapping it)

          It's yours.

                    MR. CALDWELL

          No.  I won't take it unless I pay

          for it... Let's see, that's a

          pretty nice watch -- I can see

          that.

Maurice watches him suspiciously as he pulls out an envelope

from his jacket pocket.

                    MR. CALDWELL

          Let's say I give you what's in this

          envelope for that beautiful watch.

Maurice is handed the envelope.  He opens it to find a thick

PILE OF CASH, TENS AND TWENTIES.

                    MR. CALDWELL

          I really want that watch.

                    MAURICE

          This isn't right.

                    MR. CALDWELL

          This is my only chance to get a

          watch like that.  It would mean a

          lot to me and my family.  Please

          take it.  It really isn't that

          much.

Maurice stares into the envelope emotionally and hands over

the watch tentatively.

                    MAURICE

          This is a loan.

Mr. Caldwell straps on the watch and then hugs Maurice.

The rest of the family say their good-byes.

Isaac won't let go of Maurice's hand as he walks out into the

street.

                    MR. CALDWELL

          Isaac, come back here.

Isaac just holds on tighter.  After Maurice and Isaac have

walked a few steps out into the street, Maurice kneels down.

                    MAURICE

          I have to go now.

Isaac's bottom lip protrudes as he tries not to cry.  Maurice

has to hold back a few tears himself.  He hugs Isaac tightly.

                    MAURICE

              (whispers)

          Why didn't I meet you fifteen years

          ago?

Maurice pulls away from Isaac slowly.  Isaac runs to his

mother's arms.  Maurice waves good-bye to the Caldwells as he

heads down the road.

Maurice stops, bends down to the road and picks up a TORN

WHITE PAPER STREAMER that spiraled its way to his feet.

He looks ahead and finds both sides of the street lined with

parked cars.  Some of the cars are decorated with white

streamers.

A beautiful canopy of flowers sits at the end of ten rows of

as the young bride and groom nervously say their vows.

Everyone LAUGHS warmly as the groom stumbles over his lines.

SIDE ROOM

Young Maurice sits on a chair in a tuxedo staring out the

half-open door to an OLD MAN who tries to gain his balance by

holding onto the wall.  Maurice is upset.  He runs his

fingers through his hair.

THE DOOR OPENS wide as Young Ellen comes in.  She is wearing

her WEDDING GOWN.  White lace, tight at the arms and waist --

she looks stunning.

                    ELLEN

          What's wrong?  They said something

          was wrong?

Maurice stares at his rented shoes.

                    MAURICE

          I'm fine.

Ellen moves to him and kneels before him.  She lifts his

chin.

                    ELLEN

          Everyone's here.  Everything looks

          beautiful.  They even got the white

          dove I wanted for the cake -- so

          what's wrong?  What is it?

Maurice moves his gaze from her to the half open door.

                    MAURICE

          It's him.

Ellen looks back.

                    ELLEN

          Your father?

                    MAURICE

          He's plastered.

                    ELLEN

          That's okay -- really it is.

                    MAURICE

          No it's not.  He should be here

          with me now, not trying to find

          some fucking bottle of Johnny

          Walker.  He's never been there for

          me.  I've always been alone.

Maurice looks like he may cry.

                    MAURICE

          I'm afraid Ellen... I'm scared of

          being alone again.  What if one day

          you realize how boring I am?  What

          if one day you realize you're not

          happy?

              (beat)

          I could have been alone before, but

          now you've changed things.  I can't

          be alone anymore Ellen.  I'm scared

          what's going to happen to me.

Ellen takes both his hands and squeezes them between hers.

                    ELLEN

          The day I met you, I gave you my

          heart.  Today, I give you my soul.

          Where ever you are, where ever you

          go, I will be with you.  Maurice

          Parker, I promise --

                "CHERISH EVERYDAY TOGETHER"

It is signed "M.P."

The bride and groom look at each other curiously.

          this is racism in our backyard...

Kris hangs up.

          They're pushing my Jewish temple

Kris notices Michelle's familiar bright red face.

                    KRIS

          What?

Michelle is completely flustered as usual.

                    KRIS

          Michelle, breathe... that's it,

          Umm, Coalville Utah.

Kris studies the fax before jumping up from his desk and

moving to the wall.  An enormous U.S. MAP covers three

quarters of the wall.  RED TACKS mark a trail across the

United States, beginning with Philadelphia.  Kris puts a red

tack at the top right corner of Utah.

Kris notices through the open officer door that Frank and

Seth are listening in.  Kris nods to Michelle.  Who

immediately shuts the door on their view.  Kris waves bye

Kris paces the room -- charged with excitement -- eyes

A merciless sun beats down on a long stretch of highway.  The

black tar from the road melting slightly.

No sign of Maurice.  WE SEE into the distance, not a soul in

sight.  WE LOOK to a hillside a hundred meters from the road.

There we see a figure lying still in the shade of an

overhanging rock formation.

Maurice has a towel over his eyes and his feet propped up on

his shoulder bag.  He is fast asleep.

The MOONLIGHT outlines a line figure hobbling his way step by

step with a walking stick.

The air fills with a POWERFUL RUMBLE.  Maurice turns to see a

wave of rocks and sand slide down a hillside to the road.

They CAUSE A GREAT THUNDER that settles to dust.  Maurice

walks down the center of the highway away from the hillside.

EXT.  HIGHWAY - DAWN

THE FIERY NEVADA SUN BEGINS ITS ASCENT INTO THE SKY.  Maurice

looks bad.  He's breathing heavy as he moves up a steep

incline by the side of the road.  His feet slide on the loose

dirt.  Maurice looks like he could collapse at any moment.

He makes it to the indentation in the hillside -- just enough

room to lay down in the shade.  Maurice lays out slowly.  He

pries off his sneakers, band-aids and blisters cover every

inch of his feet.  Maurice dumps the sand out of his sneakers

and painfully pulls them back on.  His eyes close as he tries

to unbutton his jacket... too late he's asleep.

Maurice's bed is a rock that juts from the side of the

hill... First WE SEE nothing, then some grains of sand escape

from the crack where the rock meets the hillside.  The CRACK

BECOMES SLIGHTLY LARGER -- PULLING AWAY FROM THE HILL BY A

FRACTION OF AN INCH.  It stabilizes there.

Maurice unaware of his precarious situation sleeps twenty

five feet above the ground.

directly overhead.

Maurice stirs in his sleep, moving closer to the edge of the

rock.

A STEADY STREAM OF SAND POURS FROM THE CRACK...

A SLIGHT TREMOR...

THEN THE FRIGHTENING SOUND OF ROCK MOVING AGAINST ROCK...

Maurice wakes up as he begins to slide off... Hands scraping

at the dirt... He SLIDES OFF THE ROCK... Feet and hands

desperately trying to cling to the hillside... He picks up

speed as he tumbles down... Maurice looks down in time to see

a small jut in the rock hurtling towards him... no time for

panic... SLAM!  A SICKENING CRACK OF BONE as Maurice HITS the

rock square in the ribs... Maurice flops down the rest of the

slope like a rag doll... he comes to rest in the dirt,

clutching his ribs.  The sun beats down on his stunned eyes.

Maurice stares up at the dizzying slope.  Sand still

trickling down to a stop.  He doesn't try to move for the

first few seconds.  His breathing increasingly erratic.

Maurice drags himself to sit upright.  The sharp pains

causing a distorted grimace on his face.  A short rest,

before working his way to his feet.

HIGHWAY

Maurice uses a highway guardrail as a backrest.  He takes a

seat in the dirt.  Maurice's hair is damp with sweat.  His

breathing relegated to slow gasps.  His left hand covering

his rib cage protectively.  Blood begins to trickle through

the spaces between his fingers.

Maurice closes his eyes for a moment, before his bent leg

goes into spasms... Maurice is forced to straighten the leg

instantly... jarring his tender rib cafe... Maurice clings to

the back of his thigh... Maurice is defeated... On the verge

of tears.

He glances way down the road and spots a TINY CLOUD OF SMOKE

miles away in the distance.  A car is moving in his

direction.

Maurice looks up into the DAZZLING WHITE SKY.  Drops of sweat

falling into his eyes.

                    MAURICE

              (whisper)

          It's over Ellen... I failed you

          again.

Maurice looks down the road at the cloud of dust growing

larger.

                    MAURICE

          I tried Ellen, I really tried... I

          don't have the strength.

The cloud is now clearly a car... Maurice stares up into the

sky again... The tears racing the sweat down his cheeks.

Maurice YELLS TO THE HEAVENS.

                    MAURICE

          You said I would never be alone!...

          You promised...

              (his yelling turns to

               sobs)

          ... You promised.

Maurice's is interrupted by A SLIGHT RUSTLING BEHIND HIS

HEAD.  Maurice turns and looks through his tears...

There, a few feet from him, perched quietly and majestically

on the guardrail is a GOLDEN EAGLE.  It stands two and half

feet tall.  It spreads it's great wings.  The feathers expand

like a blanket, spanning six feet, and throwing a gentle

shade on Maurice's face.

Maurice is frozen in wonder.  The MAGIC of the moment glows

in his eyes.  Maurice's face gains life... The dark feathered

eagle stands like a god before Maurice.  The moment is

breathtaking.

The car on the road, takes the last quarter mile in

seconds... SCREECHING IT'S BRAKES at the sight of Maurice on

the side of the road.

Maurice turns away from the bird as the car pulls up.  The

driver gets out and calls over the hood.

                    DRIVER

          Hey, man are you okay?

Maurice's face filled with strength.  He grins through the

pain.

                    MAURICE

          I'm fine.

                    DRIVER

          What the hell are you doing out

          here?  You need a ride somewhere?

                    MAURICE

          No thank you.

The driver is concerned.  He opens the driver door.

                    DRIVER

          You by yourself?

Beat.

                    MAURICE

          No.

This pacifies the driver somewhat.  He nods and gets in the

car.  Maurice watches as the car pulls away.

He turns back to the guardrail -- the eagle is gone.  Maurice

looks up into the sky.  The Golden Eagle is flying

overhead... a tiny dot against the blazing sun.

Maurice struggles to his feet using the guardrail as support.

Maurice takes his first step...

This is STEPHANIE.

                    STEPHANIE

Stephanie understands his worry.

          Maybe later.

                    MAURICE

          You should definitely have

          children.  They're really special.

Adelle and Gerald are in shock.  Maurice forks another fish

stick with a smile.

          I don't think you realize how

          serious this is Uncle.

                    MAURICE

          How serious is it?

DR. RAY, who has been standing by the window listening, steps

forward.

                    DR. RAY

          You have two broken ribs, a

          punctured spleen and Acute

          Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Maurice gives a comforting smile to Adelle.

                    DR. RAY

          The normal amount of build up in

          your arteries has been aggravated

          by over exertion.  This is called,

          "Claudication,"  As a result, there

          isn't enough circulation to your

          body.  That accounts for the

          discoloration in your extremities

          and the muscle spasms I'm sure

          you've encountered.

                    MAURICE

          Can it kill me?

                    DR. RAY

          It can, but it'll have to wait in

          line.

This surprises Maurice.

                    DR. RAY

          We ran a C.T. and an M.R.I.  We

          found bleeding in your brain.  Your

          collapse was caused by "Transient

          Cerebral-Ischemia"... a sudden loss

          of blood circulation to the brain.

          In other words, Mr. Parker, you had

          a mild stroke.

There is dead silence in the room.

                    MAURICE

              (scared)

          I suppose I over did it.

Adelle moves over to Maurice's side and holds his hand.

                    MAURICE

          What steps do we take now?

                    DR. RAY

          We operate.  We find the artery in

          the brain and close the bleeding...

          I just did this procedure on a

          Senator and he's doing fine.

                    MAURICE

          What are the odds?  Do I have a

          fifty-fifty chance of surviving the

          operation?

                    DR. RAY

          It's hard to say.  It's a delicate

          surgery.  There's no getting around

          the fact that it's a very high-risk

          situation.

Adelle strokes Maurice's hair.  Maurice stares down at his

food before looking up with great resolve.

                    MAURICE

          Then it'll have to wait until I

          finish.

                    ADELLE

          What?

                    MAURICE

          I finish the walk, and then we may

          take all the chances we want.

The room is stunned.  Adelle gets off the bed and collects

herself.

                    ADELLE

          Listen to me very carefully,

          because I don't want you to

          misunderstand me... The walk is

          over Uncle Maurice.  Done.

          Finished.  You've made it to

          California, it was a miracle, now

          let's try to save your life.

                    MAURICE

              (louder)

          I'm completing the walk.  I'm

          almost there.

                    DR. RAY

          Okay, Maurice keep it calm...

              (beat)

          We can talk about this again, but

          just so you know, we have a guard

          on this floor who's sole job it is

          to keep an eye on you.

Maurice is crushed.

                    DR. RAY

          There are a lot of people out there

          who would like to see you finish,

          including me, but I'm not willing

          to put your life in anymore risk

          than it is... We do the operation,

          and when you're better, you finish

          the walk.

The room is dead again.  Maurice drowns in his thoughts.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  HOSPITAL CHAPEL - AFTERNOON

A small chapel.  Stain glass windows overlooking the parking

lot.  Maurice sits in his wheel chair at the back of the

room.  A few other patients are scattered in the four small

pews.

Maurice has his hands folded tightly and stares up at the

statue of Mary.  His concentration is broken as a man in a

full black suit and black shirt sits next to him.  Maurice

nods at the priest.

                    PRIEST

          Hello, Mr. Parker.

                    MAURICE

          Hello.

                    PRIEST

          How are you feeling?

                    MAURICE

          Confused.  I'm not sure what to do

          now.  I'm not sure what he wants

          for me.

                    PRIEST

          He wants to reward you... That's

          why I'm here.

                    MAURICE

              (a little confused)

          What do you mean?

                    PRIEST

          I mean you've done a great thing.

          You should be rewarded monetarily.

Maurice is lost.

                    PRIEST

          What's your shoe size?

                    MAURICE

          What?  Who are you?

The priest reaches into his jacket -- for the first time WE

SEE a Polo design on his shirt and a gaudy gold chain around

his neck.

                    PRIEST

          Clive Silver -- Marketing Executive

          at Reebok.

Maurice stares at the card in disbelief.

                    CLIVE

          We want you to do some spots for

          us.

                    MAURICE

          What the hell is this?

Some of the patients turn around.

                    CLIVE

          I'm talking six figures, pay or

          play -- for two spots.  We want to

          push a new line with you...

          America's New Hero.

Maurice is flustered.  He can't take this.  His eyes become

desperate.

Clive waves his hands in the air excitedly.

                    CLIVE

          Imagine grainy black and white

          shots of long stretches of highway

          -- quick cuts with a slow pounding

          beat underneath... Then we see a

          man walking up a steep incline --

          it's you Maurice.  We see shots of

          you walking.  Cut.  Cut.  Cut.

          Fast... Music crescendoes -- Bham!

          Close up -- and you say...

          'Reebok, Because There's Nothing

          You Can't Do.'

Clive finishes.  He is surprised to find Maurice in tears.

Clive is thrown totally off as Maurice stares at him angrily

through streaming tears.

                    MAURICE

          My wife is dead.

Maurice continues his powerful gaze until Clive looks away.

Clive gathers his things and leaves the chapel without

another word.  Maurice drops his head into his hands and

cries quietly.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

A change of shifts.  Stephanie gathers her things.  She lifts

her coat off the counter.  Underneath is a paper.  She spins

the paper to face her.  The headline reads, "The End of a

Journey - Parker Hospitalized."

                                                  CUT TO:

HOSPITAL ROOM

Stephanie peeks into the dark room.

                    STEPHANIE

              (whispers)

          Good night Mr. Parker.  I'll see

          you tomorrow.

Stephanie waits for a response from the motionless figure on

the bed.  She leaves the room a little disappointed.

WE MOVE CLOSER TO THE BED.  We see Maurice laying still --

the battered photo of Ellen clutches to his chest.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  HOSPITAL HALL - DAY

Stephanie is wheeling Maurice down the hall.  Maurice has a

glint of happiness in his eye.  They move through the doors

marked "Visitor's Area."

Maurice stretches a huge grin as KRIS REDDY gets up from a

chair.  Kris bends down and hugs Maurice emotionally.

                    KRIS

          Tom Joad?

                    MAURICE

          ... The Grapes of Wrath.

                    KRIS

          You're amazing.

                                                  CUT TO:

LATER

Maurice and Kris seated in the corner of the room.

                    MAURICE

          I missed you Kris.

                    KRIS

          I missed you to Mr. Parker.

                    MAURICE

          Adelle told me, your writing is

          going well.  The Crusader for

          social issues and all.

                    KRIS

          You were right.  From the heart is

          always better.

Beat.

                    KRIS

          I drove by the bookstore -- it's

          boarded up now.  There's a sign

          over the wood -- "Office space

          available."

The loss is evident on Maurice's eyes.

                    MAURICE

          I haven't been too punctual with

          the rent.

                    KRIS

          I was thinking you could open

          another store with investors.  I'm

          sure a lot of people would want to

          get involved with you now.

Maurice forces a smile.

                    MAURICE

          Actually, I'm not worried about my

          career right now... I'm more

          worried about how you're getting me

          out of here?

Beat.  Kris glances at the hair on his forearm.

                    MAURICE

          Are they standing?

                    KRIS

              (running his hand over his

               arm)

          Saluting.

Beat.

                    KRIS

          Come on Mr. Parker.

                    MAURICE

          What, come on?

                    KRIS

          I can't do it.  I want you to

          finish, but I want you to live

          more.

Maurice sits back straight.  He looks upset.

                    MAURICE

          We do the operation after I finish.

          I can't risk not finishing... I

          thought you understood what I was

          doing.

                    KRIS

          I do.

                    MAURICE

          Why in God's name did you fly all

          the way here then?

                    KRIS

          Don't do this.

                    MAURICE

          ... To look me in the eye and say

          what's important to you isn't as

          important to me?  To tell me you

          know what's best?  To tell me life

          is more precious than what I feel

          for my wife?

Kris gets very emotional.  He rises from this chair.

                    KRIS

          Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if

          it'll help.  But I'm not risking

          your life.

                    MAURICE

          It's mine to risk.

Maurice turns to the window away from Kris.

                    KRIS

          Your operation is scheduled for

          Friday.  I'll be back before then.

Kris walks to the door and stops.

                    KRIS

          She knows you love her Mr. Parker.

          She knows now.

                    MAURICE

              (not looking at Kris)

          No more words.  Until I touch the

          ocean with my hands... it's all

          just words.

Kris is tortured.  He leaves the room.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  HOSPITAL HALL - DAY

Maurice wheels himself into the hall from the waiting area.

He looks around.  His eyes lock on the EXIT SIGN over the

door at the end of the hall.  His eyes scan the area quickly.

He immediately finds the guard on the floor staring at him.

The guard nods ever so slightly as if to say, "I know what

you're thinking."  Maurice turns his attention to a small boy

in a hospital gown, being scolded by a head nurse.

                    HEAD NURSE

          You cooperate with us about taking

          your medicine and maybe we'll talk

          about candy.

The head nurse takes a chocolate bar out of the boy's tiny

hands.  The boy offers no response.  Maurice watches

curiously as STEPHANIE walks over and pats the boys head.

Maurice catches a small exchange -- Stephanie slips another

candy bar into his pocket.  The boy breaks into a warm smile.

Stephanie puts her fingers against her lips and winks.

Maurice takes this exchange in with great interest.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Stephanie steps into the room and prepares a tray of food.

The SILHOUETTED FIGURE of Maurice seated near the bay window

turns to face her.

                    STEPHANIE

          You should be in bed.

The face stares back from the shadows.  She feels him

watching.

                    MAURICE

          What do your friends call you?

                    STEPHANIE

          Steph.

                    MAURICE

          Do you have a car, Steph?

Beat.

                    STEPHANIE

          You should be in bed...

Stephanie moves to Maurice... She stops short when his face

comes into view.  His eyes are raw -- red.  His face puffy.

                    STEPHANIE

          You're in pain.

                    MAURICE

          I need your help.

                    STEPHANIE

          They told me, you might try to talk

          me into something... You need to

          rest Mr. Parker... It's for your

          own good.

              (beat)

          I've been following your story for

          a long while.  It's a beautiful

          thing you did.

                    MAURICE

          You ever lose somebody Stephanie?

                    STEPHANIE

          Mr. Parker, I'm supposed to give

          you your fish sticks.

Beat.  Maurice melts her with his expression.

                    STEPHANIE

          ... My father.

                    MAURICE

          Did you tell him everything you

          wanted to?  Did you do everything

          you could while he was here?

She shakes her head "No" -- the tears welling up in her eyes.

                    MAURICE

          If I don't do this Steph, my life

          isn't worth saving.

Maurice reaches out and squeezes her soft trembling hand.

                    MAURICE

          Please, help me.

INT.  HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

Stephanie throws a nervous smile to the guard as she escorts

a doctor down the hall... The doctor's oversized while lab

coat almost drags on the floor as he tries to hide the pain

of being on his feet.  MAURICE PARKER studies a bogus chart

in his hands.  His new glasses, sliding off his nose.  Beads

of sweat -- revealing his agony.

                                                  CUT TO:

ELEVATOR

Three people in the elevator; Stephanie, Dr. Maurice Parker,

and a female physician.  The female doctor looks at Maurice

curiously, studying his demeanor -- she can't place him.

The ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN on the third floor... The SOUND OF A

TV FLOODS THE ELEVATOR COMPARTMENT.  Maurice looks up in

horror to see a close-up of his FACE superimposed on the TV

screen seated on the receptionist's desk.  A man gets on the

elevator.

The female doctor stares at the TV as the doors close -- she

immediately turns to Maurice... her view is blocked by the

new passenger... the elevator progresses down 2... 1...

The female doctor leans forward trying to get a glimpse of

Maurice... THE BELL DINGS as the doors open on the ground

floor.

Doctor Maurice Parker and Stephanie quickly exit... the

female doctor stays in the elevator and watches carefully.

                    FEMALE DOCTOR

              (yells)

          Excuse me, doctor...

DOWN THE HALL... Maurice pauses and turns around -- fear

etched across his face.  The female doctor looks around the

barren hall then turns back to Maurice.

                    FEMALE DOCTOR

          Good luck.

The female doctor smiles as the doors shut.  After a few

moments of shock -- Maurice smiles back.

Stephanie yanks Maurice down the hall and out the EMERGENCY

ROOM EXIT.

Stephanie's white VW Rabbit pulls to a stop.

                    MAURICE

He turns back to Stephanie who stares back at him

emotionally.

                    STEPHANIE

          I never thanked my father.  He did

          so much for me... I never thanked

          him.

Maurice holds her sad face in his scared hands.

                    MAURICE

              (whispering)

          It's not too late.

Maurice gets out of the car painfully slow.  He pulls his

shoulder back upright with a laborious breath.  A sense of

pride returns to his face.  He turns back to Stephanie and

catches a horrified look.  He follows her stare...

She is staring at his shirt... He looks down to see a DARK

CRIMSON STAIN GROWING beneath the surface.  He covers the

area with his hand.

                    MAURICE

          You're going to have a lot of work

          to do when I get back.

                    STEPHANIE

          Someone should be with you.

Beat.

                    MAURICE

          Someone is.

He gives her his best smile and begins shuffling his feet

over the loose gravel of the road... one step at a time.

Keeping in step with Newton is a police officer.  SERGEANT

EMORY, jet white hair, army cut, gives him an intimidating

Newton stops Emory before entering.

                    NEWTON

          I'm afraid Mrs. Matlin is very

Emory lets the warning sink in before opening the door.

Adelle's VOICE IS BOOMING.

                                                  CUT TO:

HOSPITAL ROOM

Adelle YELLS at Dr. Ray, a few nurses, and the guard who was

on duty.

                    ADELLE

          ... "American Journal of

          Psychology", "Psychological

          Review", and "Science", so I think

          it's safe to say my opinion is

          valid.

She catches her breath.

                    ADELLE

          How does a grown man who can barely

          walk, just stroll out?... This is

          not James Bond here, this is my

          uncle who owns a bookstore, and

          gets outwitted by grade school kids

          pulling pranks!

Adelle notices the new people in the room.

                    NEWTON

          Mrs. Matlin, this is Sergeant

          Emory.  He'll help us find your

          uncle.

Adelle walks up to Emory.

                    ADELLE

          Let me tell you a story Sergeant.

          There was a patient of mine who had

          a Golden Retriever, Mac... She

          loved Mac, not like a pet, but like

          a family member.  One day, she had

          to leave Mac with 'friends', and

          wouldn't you know it, Mac gets away

          and ends up falling into a sewer.

          My patient comes back -- goes nuts

          when she hears that Mac has been in

          the sewer for over 48 hours.

          Apparently the cop who found the

          dog didn't want to get his pants

          dirty.  And neither did anyone

          else.  So of course, my patient

          decides to go in after it... she

          falls... breaks her hip and lands

          next to her dead dog, who died of

          toxic fumes down there...

Adelle looks around at all the engrossed faces.

                    ADELLE

          The moral of the story is... She

          sued for a lot of money!  She sued

          the friends, the city, and the

          officer for negligence on duty.

          She has no Mac, no happiness, but

          she's very rich now... That was a

          dog.  We're talking about a human

          being...

          I hope everyone clearly understands

          the chain of events that will occur

          if something should happen to my

          uncle, whom I love more than you

          can possibly imagine... Now

          Sergeant I would like to know right

          now, if you're willing to get your

          pants dirty for my uncle?

Adelle and Emory have a staring contest.  Adelle wins.

Adelle stands alone in a room with four men, and she is

clearly the one in charge.

The door flies open.  A police officer walks in pushing KRIS

REDDY through the door.

                    OFFICER

          I found him sneaking up the back

          stairs with this.

The officer holds out a long coat and hat.  Emory walks up to

Kris.

                    EMORY

          Did you help Mr. Parker leave this

          hospital?

Kris looks to the empty bed and smiles... a BIG SMILE.

                    KRIS

          No... But I was going to.

Beat.  Emory turns to the officer and ushers him to the door.

                    EMORY

          Forget him.  It's time to get our

          pants dirty.

Adelle smiles.

                    EMORY

          I want three black and whites from

          here to Handley Avenue.  And no

          communication with the station.

          The press monitors the

          transmissions.

                    KRIS

              (a born actor)

          They can do that?

                    EMORY

          That goes for all of you.  Not a

          word about this disappearance to

          anyone.  Absolutely no press.

Kris smiles innocently.

A COMMOTION BREAKS OUT ONE BLOCK DOWN... Kris spins in that

direction... sees a crowd forming at the corner of the

sidewalk... Starts toward them... Kris sees something through

the thinner parts of the crowd... something laying on the

sidewalk... A man!  Kris' walk turns into a sprint.

Kris works his way through the growing crowd, puncturing the

center of the circle... Kris gazes down at the man writhing

on the concrete... A black man, shaking uncontrollably.  A

women standing over the fallen man waves the crowd back.

                    WOMAN

          He has Epilepsy, just give him

          room... An ambulance is on the way.

The crowd spreads out.  Kris looks down at the unconscious

man on the sidewalk sadly -- Kris' thoughts race.  He moves

on with newfound concern.

A converted gymnasium.  The room is splintered into rows of

folding tables and chairs.  Against the wall, is the serving

IN THE CORNER

The room is crowded with homeless men and women and a few

children.  In the back we find MAURICE.  In his old clothes,

and tired disheveled appearance -- Maurice is virtually

invisible in this crowd.  He presses something to his injured

side.  His condition has worsened.

He eyes the entrance where a POLICE OFFICER walks in and

moves to the serving counter.  The officer asks the serving

lady something, and shows her a picture.  She shrugs her

shoulders and continues serving.  The cop takes one last look

around the hundreds of hungry people leaving the room.

Maurice pulls up his hand from underneath his shirt.  The

napkin he was holding at his side is SATURATED WITH BLOOD.

Maurice replaces it with a clean napkin.

Klein lays the last paper on the table.

          Is that all?

                    KLEIN

          No.  The Mayor sent word, that he

          wants this thing handled quickly,

          before anything unfortunate

          happens.  He said he doesn't want

          to be known as the 'Mayor of the

          City Where Maurice Parker Died!'

Klein opens the door.  Adelle walks in and stands at a

bloodshot, and tired.

          What happened with the museum

          No... No.

          I spoke with Dr. Ray this morning,

          and he said it was highly unlikely

          that someone in his condition could

          survive this long without medical

          attention, let alone walk sixty

          miles -- in fact his exact word

          was, 'Impossible'.

Adelle fiddles with her coat.

                    EMORY

          If I knew where he was, I'd get him

          off the street, but I think it's

          everyone else be braced for the

still in the hot sun.

A hispanic man in his late forties, JUAN is seated in his

Dodge Caravan when he sees someone in his rearview mirror.  A

man is using a stick as a cane.  The struggling man makes his

way along the shoulder very slowly.

Juan reaches over to his passenger seat and turns over the

L.A. Times.  Under the heading, "He's Back!" is Maurice's

picture.  Juan quickly rolls down his window as Maurice

passes by on the shoulder.

              (yelling)

          Hey, Maurice man -- keep going

          buddy!

Maurice is startled at the man's yell, but then smiles when

the words register.  Maurice struggles forward.

Juan keeps yelling encouragements... This grabs the attention

of other drivers who realize who is walking past them.  One

by one, car doors open and people call to Maurice.

Cars start to HONK... More and more people turn to see the

commotion... The YELLING AND HONKING IS JOINED BY WHISTLES

AND CHEERS --

Maurice can't believe it -- he tries to smile but can't hold

it.  His face tightens with every step.  His shirt is soiled

with blood.  He raises his hand and gives a weak wave to a

woman who holds up her little boy through the sunroof of the

          about?

                    DAWSON (V.O.)

          The Doors, the musical group.  I

          saw a documentary where the police

          stopped one of their concerts,

          snatched Jim Morrison right off the

          stage... the crowd went frickin

          How does he look?

          He's having breathing problems and

          he's as pale as stone.  If he

eyes squeezed shut.  A surge of intense pain tries to buckle

him... Maurice fights it off as he moves his feet again.

The helicopter SWOOPS above as he makes his turn onto a FINAL

Maurice and Kris have an entire conversation with one

emotional look.

The SOUNDS of SIRENS BREAK the moment.  Kris turns to see two

police cars turn on the street behind them.

Kris turns to Maurice.

sweat falling from his brow.  People in the crowd cover their

mouths in shock as they get a clear view of him... His shirt

soaked on one side with blood, his entire body shaking with

pain, and exhaustion, his face hollow and pale -- ghostly.

Maurice stops in his tracks.  He looks up at a wooden sign,

worn from the years of salt water air.  The sign reads:

                "PACIFICA BEACH - 1/2 MILE"

Maurice's thoughts fade away from this place, this time...

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  PHILADELPHIA - FIFTEEN YEARS AGO - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

WE ARE IN THE PARKER BEDROOM.  The lights are off.  The

MOONLIGHT FROM THE WINDOWS BLANKETS Young Maurice and Young

Ellen as they lay in bed.  Ellen is cradled in Maurice's

arms.  She is awake and watching the shadows dance on the

ceiling.  She speaks in whispers.

                    ELLEN

          What do you think heaven is like?

Maurice opens his eyes and stares at his beautiful wife.

                    MAURICE

          I don't know.

                    ELLEN

          I think it's a different place for

          each person.

                    MAURICE

          Did you have a dream?

Beat.

                    ELLEN

          I know where my heaven is.

                    MAURICE

          Where?

                    ELLEN

          Pacifica, California.

Maurice chuckles.

                    MAURICE

          Why there?

                    ELLEN

          When I was ten, my family lived in

          Pacifica for a year.  I used to go

          to the beach everyday that summer.

          I never felt so happy, carefree.

          It was a magic place for me...

          That's where my heaven will be.

Beat.

                    ELLEN

          Maurice?

                    MAURICE

          Yes.

                    ELLEN

          If I die, you'll know where to look

          for me?

                    MAURICE

          Go to sleep Ellen.

                    ELLEN

          No really, if God takes us away

          from each other, you know where to

          look now?

Beat.

                    MAURICE

              (pacifying her)

          The beach of Pacifica, California.

                    ELLEN

          Good.

Beat.

                    MAURICE

          Go to sleep Ellen.

Ellen smiles as she cradles deeper into Maurice's arms.

Husband and wife fall asleep together.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  PACIFICA BEACH SIGN - DAY (PRESENT)

Maurice snaps back to the present, the PAIN AND COMMOTION

come back in a tidal wave of reality.

Maurice wipes the tears in his eyes and tries to take a step.

Someone blocks his way.

                    ADELLE

          Uncle Maurice, please, we have to

          get you to a hospital.

Adelle looks at her wounded Uncle sadly.  She touches his

shirt and her hand comes away with blood.

                    MAURICE

          I have to finish first.

                    ADELLE

          I won't let you die.

The inner circle of people bursts open, as KRIS BREAKS

THROUGH.

                    KRIS

          Let him finish Adelle.  He's almost

          there.

                    ADELLE

              (yelling)

          He's almost dead.  Can't you see

          that!  This has nothing to do with

          you.

Maurice touches Adelle's cheek turning her attention back to

him.  He barely manages to get the words out.

                    MAURICE

          It has nothing to do with you

          either... This is between Ellen and

          me.

Beat.  Maurice begins crying uncontrollably.

                    MAURICE

          I'm begging you...

Maurice takes her hand and bends down putting his forehead to

her hand as if getting blessings from her.

                    MAURICE

          Let me do this for Ellen, let me do

          this for my wife.

Adelle's heart is breaking.  She weeps openly as she

straightens her Uncle to an upright position.  She wipes the

tears from his eyes with her hand gently.

AT THAT MOMENT THE INNER CIRCLE BREAKS OPEN AS TWO OFFICERS

RUSH IN.  They reach for Maurice.

                    ADELLE

          Touch him, and they'll be a riot...

Adelle stands firm, the strength in her growing with each

second.

                    ADELLE

          ... and I'll start it.

The officers are taken off guard.  They look around at the

countless sea of eyes on them.  Adelle sees they won't do

anything and moves to Maurice's side.

Maurice begins to walk again.  Adelle to one side, Kris to

the other and thousands of people following in step.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  BEACH FRONT - DAY

The wave of people led by Maurice walk toward the beach.  The

beach is blocked off by barricades all along it's perimeter.

Police officers stand every ten feet along it's edge.

A young officer watches fearfully as the ocean of people move

towards him.  OFFICER GANTZ TALKS INTO HIS WALKIE-TALKIE.

                    GANTZ

          He's coming.  What should I do?

                                                  CUT TO:

SERGEANT EMORY

at the other end of the beach barricade, holding back

hundreds of people trying to get to the beach.  Emory holds

his walkie-talkie and looks around at the sea of anxious

faces.  He makes eye contact with a woman in tears.

                                                  CUT TO:

OFFICER GANTZ

clicking off his walkie-talkie as the crowd presses up to the

barricade.  Officer Gantz is in awe as Maurice appears from

the crowd -- looking like a ghost of war... a holy

apparition.  Maurice works his way painfully to Gantz.

Gantz looks into Maurice's pleading eyes.  Maurice tries to

say something, but nothing can come out...

Gantz turns away from Maurice and picks up one of the

barricades.  He makes an opening about three feet wide.

Gantz turns back to Maurice, stands at attention, and steps

aside.

                    GANTZ

              (with unspeakable

               admiration)

          Watch your step Mr. Parker.

Adelle and Kris watch in amazement as Maurice TAKES HIS FIRST

STEP ONTO THE SAND.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

An empty beach.  ALL SOUND AND CHAOS DISAPPEARS.  THE GENTLE

HISS OF THE OCEAN FILLS THE AIR.

The last fifty yards...

The steps in the sand, heavy, torturous.  Each step, a step

closer to her...

Maurice picks up the pace.  His numb feet making prints in

the sand.  His lungs on fire...

Twenty feet left... Ten... Five...

The COOL WATER engulfs his feet and ankles.  Maurice falls to

his knees like a man falling before God.

Kneeling in the water, Maurice raises his hands to his eyes.

The water spills between his fingers... clear, pure, magical.

Maurice GASPS hard as he falls onto his back.  The water

comes in and washes over him... Gasping harder... He's

staring into the sky... Another wave of ocean gently blankets

him... Gasp... He spots something above him, fluttering...

his vision BLURS... WHITE FLUTTERING... SLOW-MOTION.  THE

IMAGE CLEARS... Maurice smiles as he makes out the image of a

WHITE DOVE FLYING ABOVE HIM...

Maurice takes a short breath, very short.  His body goes

still -- his eyes stay fixes at one point... No more pain, no

more loss, no more words...

The water washes over Maurice A. Parker...

Over his lifeless body...

And over his smile...

                                           FADE TO BLACK.
