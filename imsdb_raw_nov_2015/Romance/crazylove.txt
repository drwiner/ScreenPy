          FADE IN:

          INT. BEDROOM - APARTMENT - DAY

          The sweet silence of slumber. Suddenly, an alarm clock on a

          nightstand SHRIEKS the operatic tones of Maria Callas.

          A well-manicured hand, nails painted pink, slaps the snooze

          button and mutes Maria. A few seconds reprieve.

          Then, another clock, stationed on a dresser, broadcasts the

          FORTISSIMO POUNDING of the "William Tell Overture." Toes,

          also painted pink, swing out of bed and run to the dresser.

          LETTY MAYER, late 20s and beautiful, turns off the music.

          She opens a dresser drawer and surveys panties that are

          arranged by color, from white to beige to black. Behind the

          panties are rows of bras, also organized by color. Letty

          pulls out some taupe undergarments, checks them against her

          nails and replaces them in favor of a pink bra and panties.

          Letty goes to her closet and removes a tailored, pink linen

          suit. She lays it on the bed. Beast, her cat, jumps on the

          bed and settles into the jacket. Letty swoops the animal off

          her clothes and brushes cat hair from the suit.

                               LETTY

                     Listen, Beast. What have I told

                     you about linen?

          The scolding is cut short by an "Urge Overkill" song that

          SCREAMS OUT from another room. On cue, Letty heads down the

          hall, dressing as she goes. She CLUCKS for Beast to follow.

          INT. KITCHEN - SAME

          Letty turns off the alarm clock that BLASTS "Urge Overkill"

          from the counter and checks the time against her watch.

          She swings open a cupboard to look at cans of cat food

          arranged by type. Seafood on the left, chicken in the

          middle, then, naturally, beef. Letty reaches for a can.

                               LETTY

                         (looking at Beast)

                     It's liver saute.

          Letty considers the cat a moment, and chooses another can.

                               LETTY

                     Fine, then, chicken in gravy. But

                     you're going to have to eat the

                     liver tomorrow.

                                                                      2.

          INT. BATHROOM - SAME

          Letty puts the finishing touches on her make-up and pulls

          back her hair, plastering an errant curl into place with hair

          spray. Yet another alarm clock sounds, this time BLARING the

          voice of shock jocks MARK AND BRIAN.

          INT. ENTRY HALL - SAME

          Letty hurries down the hall and turns off the clock, which is

          mounted near the front door. She bends down to kiss the cat

          good-bye, grabs a briefcase and leaves.

          EXT. HALLWAY - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

          A school bell BUZZES. Grade-schoolers, clutching lunch

          pails, scurry past Letty, who stands outside an office door.

          She straightens her jacket, takes a deep breath and starts to

          turn the handle.

          Letty is stopped cold when CHANDRA, 7, the victim of a bloody

          nose, runs up to her, bawling.

                              CHANDRA

                    Miss Mayer. Miss Mayer.

          Letty looks quickly at Chandra, her watch, the door.

                              LETTY

                        (to Chandra)

                    Goodness, this is a bad one.   Tip

                    your head back.

          She bends down and pushes back Chandra's head. Chandra, off

          balance, places one very bloody hand on Letty's jacket lapel,

          staining it for all eternity.

          Letty, grimacing, takes the bloody hand firmly in her own and

          guides Chandra down the hall, coaxing the child as she goes.

                              LETTY

                    Come on. Pinch it, Chandra. Pinch

                    it.

          INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - LATER

          PRINCIPAL GAIL LAUER, 40s, sits in uncomfortable silence with

          BILL JOHANSEN, the 50-something school Superintendent. Also

          present are MRS. MONTES, who is a School Board Member, and

          two other BOARD MEMBERS.

          Principal Gail glances at the clock. Mrs. Montes taps her

          foot. Johansen clears his throat.

                                                                     3.

                              JOHANSEN

                    Well, I have a full calendar today,

                    and I'm afraid...

          The door bursts open. Letty stumbles into the room. She

          clutches her briefcase to her chest, trying to cover her

          blood-smeared lapel.

                              LETTY

                    Mr. Johansen, hello. I'm so sorry

                    I'm late. It's very nice to meet

                    you.

          Letty continues to hug the briefcase while awkwardly bending

          down to shake hands with Johansen and the others.

                              PRINCIPAL GAIL

                    The Superintendent was just getting

                    ready to leave.

                              LETTY

                    I do apologize.    A student had a

                    crisis.

                              MRS. MONTES

                    A crisis, you say?

                              LETTY

                    A bloody nose...

          There is no response. Letty reluctantly lowers the briefcase

          and reveals the stain.

                              LETTY

                    A bloody nose of epic proportions.

          Johansen smiles.

                              JOHANSEN

                    OK, Miss Mayer. Ten minutes.     Wow

                    us.

          EXT. PLAYGROUND - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - LATER

          A bunch of BOYS play kickball in a haze of sawdust. Chandra

          sits on a bench, clamping an ice pack to her nose. JENNY, a

          limber 8-year-old, hangs upside down from the jungle gym.

          Letty talks on her CELL PHONE. She glances around to monitor

          her wards, eyes darting like a hawk's toward the kickball

          game.

                                                                   4.

                               LETTY

                    No cherry drops, Jenny.

                        (into the phone)

                    Yes, hi. I'm calling for Paul

                    Lascher.

                        (beat)

                    Could you tell him it's Letty?

                        (beat)

                    He can't? Um, well, tell him, tell

                    him that they went for my math

                    idea. Thanks.

          Letty dials again. She sees two boys fighting over the ball

          and moves in to break them up.

                               LETTY

                        (to boys)

                    Not so rough, guys.

                        (into phone)

                    Mom? Hi. You'll never guess

                    what...I've got the best news.

                        (beat)

                    No, about work. How about dinner?

          Brawl averted, out of the corner of her eye, Letty catches

          Jenny make the daring Cherry Drop back flip off the bar. She

          blows a series of ANGRY, STACCATO NOTES on her whistle.

                               LETTY

                        (to Jenny)

                    You're in trouble, young lady.

                        (into the phone)

                    I know, Mom. But it's the only

                    place I can call from.

                        (beat)

                    Can you tell Ruth about dinner?

                        (beat)

                    Paul's fine, just fine.

          The class bell BUZZES.

                              LETTY

                    Got to go, Mom.   The monsters call.

          INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Tuxedoed waiters glide through the tony restaurant, where the

          patrons dare speak only in hushed tones. Letty sits sipping

          wine with her mother, MRS. MARTHA MAYER, immaculate in a

          cream suit, young looking for her 50-odd years.

                                                                   5.

          Letty's sister RUTH--early 20s and pretty, with flyaway hair

          and an ever-present smile--bounds into the restaurant, oozing

          happiness. Letty discretely waves her over.

                              RUTH

                    Sorry I'm late.

          Letty pours her a glass of wine.

                              MRS. MAYER

                    Letty was just getting ready to

                    tell me her good news.

                              RUTH

                        (to Letty)

                    Tell, tell.

                              MRS. MAYER

                        (leaning toward Letty)

                    Letty, dear, is that a cat hair on

                    your blouse?

          Letty removes the nasty hair from her blouse.

                              LETTY

                    So, I got the district to approve

                    my after-school math program.

          Ruth smiles at her, but vacantly.

                               MRS. MAYER

                    How wonderful, darling.

                        (beat)

                    What does that mean for you?

                              LETTY

                    I'll be running it three days a

                    week, and...

                              MRS. MAYER

                    Will you get time off to do that?

                              LETTY

                    Not now, but maybe later, if they

                    like the program.

          Ruth stares around the restaurant, a shit-eating grin

          plastered across her face.

                              LETTY

                        (to Ruth)

                    What's up with you?

                                                                 6.

                             RUTH

                    Me? Nothing. Tell me more about

                    the job.

                              MRS. MAYER

                        (to Ruth)

                    Not a job, a promotion.

                              LETTY

                    No, Mom, it's more of a prestige

                    thing.

                               RUTH

                    Mmmmmmm.

          Letty passes her hand in front of Ruth's eyes.

                               LETTY

                    Ruth.   Calling Ruth.

                              RUTH

                        (laughing)

                    Sorry.

                              LETTY

                    Just go ahead and tell us.

                              RUTH

                    There's nothing to tell.

                              MRS. MAYER

                        (to Ruth)

                    Are you sure, Dear?

                               LETTY

                    Come on.

                               RUTH

                    No, really. Tell me about the

                    promotion.

                              LETTY

                    Well, my theory is that people can

                    really enjoy math, but they lose

                    interest...

          Ruth can't hold it a moment longer without bursting.

                              RUTH

                        (almost screaming)

                    I'm getting married.

                                                                   7.

          Mrs. Mayer's eyes immediately fill with tears. Ruth leaps up

          and hugs her mother. Other diners glance toward the table.

          One WOMAN IN THE RESTAURANT taps the side of her glass with

          her fork and raises a silent toast to Ruth. Other DINERS

          follow suit. Ruth grins back and starts to giggle.

                               MRS. MAYER

                    I'm so happy for you.     It's just

                    wonderful.

          Mrs. Mayer dabs her eyes with her napkin.

                              MRS. MAYER

                    My goodness. A wedding.      My

                    goodness.

                               LETTY

                    Wow.   Congratulations.

          Ruth dashes around the table to embrace the stunned Letty.

                              RUTH

                        (to Letty)

                    Can you believe it?

          Ruth sits back down and pulls a gorgeous ring from her purse.

          She slips it on and wiggles her finger in front of Letty and

          her mother, who peers at it with approval.

                              MRS. MAYER

                    Tell us every detail.

                              LETTY

                    You've only known Jake a few

                    months.

                              RUTH

                    Three and a week.

                        (screaming again)

                    Isn't it great?

                               MRS. MAYER

                    My goodness. What about an

                    engagement party? We must start

                    planning.

                        (signaling a waiter)

                    Champagne. Girls, we need some

                    champagne.

          Off Letty's frozen smile, we

                                                      CUT TO:

                                                                   8.

          INT. BEDROOM - LETTY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Letty's in bed, drawing a giant multiplication chart. PAUL

          LASCHER, early 30s, handsome in a corporate way, shrugs off

          his expensive suit.

          He opens a drawer of Letty's dresser, and removes a neatly

          pressed T-shirt. He smooths out another shirt he has

          accidently rumpled in the process.

                              PAUL

                    So, another one bites the dust.

                               LETTY

                    It's not another one. It's my

                    sister.

                        (beat)

                    Aren't you happy for her?

                              PAUL

                    She's only known the guy a few

                    months.

          Paul lays his folded trousers across Letty's desk.

                              PAUL

                    Can I put these here for tonight?

                               LETTY

                        (pointing to the closet)

                    In there's better.

                        (beat)

                    It's kind of romantic, don't you

                    think?

                              PAUL

                    I really think if you're going to

                    spend your life with someone you

                    want to know them pretty damn well.

          Paul sits on the bed, and leans against a pillow.

                              LETTY

                    Believe me, I know your feelings on

                    the matter.

                              PAUL

                    The receptionist said you called

                    earlier about something.

          Letty holds up her multiplication chart and shows it to Paul.

                                                        9.

                              LETTY

                    My math program. The

                    Superintendent said he'd fund it.

                              PAUL

                    Good going. I knew you could do

                    it.

          Paul kisses Letty on the cheek.

                              PAUL

                    It looks like we're both bucking

                    for advancement.

                               LETTY

                    Yeah?

                              PAUL

                    Huntley told me today that if I

                    come through on the Benton

                    deposition, they may consider me

                    for senior associate.

          Letty hugs Paul.

                               LETTY

                    Congratulations.    We should

                    celebrate.

                              PAUL

                    I was thinking dinner on Friday

                    with James and Meg at the Saint

                    Mark.

                              LETTY

                    I mean tonight.

          Letty sensually caresses his shoulders.

                              LETTY

                    Like right now...

                              PAUL

                    Actually, I need to review the

                    deposition questions tonight.

                    Maybe tomorrow?

                               LETTY

                    Oh, ok.   Maybe.

                                                                    10.

                              PAUL

                    But I thought if you don't mind,

                    you could listen and see how I come

                    across?

                               LETTY

                        (beat)

                    Sure. Of course.

          Letty continues coloring her multiplication chart.

                               PAUL

                    Letty, please, I need your full

                    attention.

          Letty puts the chart down and sits up straighter.

                              LETTY

                    Let me have it.

          INT. CLASSROOM - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

          Letty rubs her eyes with fatigue.    Bobby stands next to her

          holding a crumpled paper bag.

                              BOBBY

                    My dog ate my turtle, and the shell

                    went crunch. I brought it for show-

                    and-tell.

          The children perk up at this news.

                              LETTY

                    I'm sorry about your turtle Bobby,

                    but you know we only have show-and-

                    tell on Mondays. Today, we're

                    scheduled for grammar.

                              BOBBY

                    But my mom says I have to throw it

                    away tonight.

          Bobby opens the bag. He reaches in to remove the turtle. The

          children TITTER. Letty's on him in a second.

                              LETTY

                    Don't even think about it.

          She grabs the bag. From outside, there is a KNOCK.     Letty

          and the students look toward the window.

          It's Ruth. She's been crying.   She waves to Letty.    Chandra

          waves back at Ruth.

                                                                     11.

          Letty puts up her finger to signal "just a minute" to Ruth.

          She sets the turtle bag on Bobby's desk.

                              LETTY

                    Class, why don't you...

          Ruth knocks on the glass again. Letty glances at her

          distraught sister and walks quickly toward the door.

                              LETTY

                        (to class)

                    You guys pull out your verb sheets

                    and review them.

          Letty leaves the room. The class watches through the window

          as Ruth throws her sobbing self into Letty's arms.

          EXT. HALLWAY - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - SAME

                              RUTH

                    She says she won't even come if Dad

                    brings Monica.

                              LETTY

                    Mom won't miss your wedding.

                    She'll come around. I promise she

                    will.

          Letty glances through the window at her classroom, where

          Bobby waves the turtle over his head.

                              RUTH

                    How?

                               LETTY

                    I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too.

                        (beat)

                    A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics

                    and they'll be ours.

                              RUTH

                    Maybe if we had them both to dinner

                    or something.

          Letty looks again at the classroom, where the students are

          lobbing the turtle back and forth.

                              LETTY

                    Maybe.

                              RUTH

                    You always throw the best dinner

                    parties, Letty.

                                                                   12.

          Letty's attention snaps back to Ruth.

                              LETTY

                    Oh, wait a minute, now I see where

                    you're going.

                              RUTH

                    Please, Letty.

                              LETTY

                    Mom and Dad? At dinner together?

                    Are you crazy?

          Ruth starts to sob--big, loud, air-gulping sobs.   Letty pats

          her shoulder.

                              LETTY

                    Maybe, though. Maybe it would

                    work. I could throw you an

                    engagement party maybe.

                              RUTH

                    Really?

          Principal Gail, trolling the halls, spies Letty with Ruth.

          She dispatches a stern look in Letty's direction.

                              LETTY

                        (nodding toward Gail)

                    You know what, Ruthie? I better get

                    back to my class, OK?

                              RUTH

                    And the party?

                              LETTY

                    Yeah, it'll be fun.

          Ruth grabs Letty in another hug.

                              RUTH

                    Thank you so much.

          INT. CLASSROOM - SAME

          Letty strides into the classroom, pulls the turtle away from

          Bobby and drops it in the trash.

                              LETTY

                    Who can come up here and give me a

                    sentence with a "to be" verb in it?

                                                                     13.

                              ZACH

                    Who was that girl?

                              LETTY

                    Come on up, Zach.

          Zach approaches the board and begins to write, "I am..."    He

          doesn't get any further before Letty cuts him off.

                              LETTY

                    Neater, Zach.

          Zach begins again, but Letty stops him when he reaches "am."

                              LETTY

                    Zach, you know the line by the "a"

                    has to come straight down or it

                    looks like an "o."

          Zach looks back toward his classmates for help.

                              LETTY

                    What's wrong, Zach?

          Letty picks up a piece of chalk and writes an "a." She

          erases it furiously and works at it until the "a" is perfect.

                               L

                              LETTY

                    Try again, Zach.    Like that.

          Letty jabs at the board with a piece of chalk. Zach freezes.

          He sees Letty's shoes, her arm, her contorted face, and,

          above all else, that perfect "a" staring right back down at

          him.

          Letty grips Zach's arm, guiding the chalk to form what looks

          like a pretty good "a."

                              LETTY

                    I don't believe it.    You still

                    can't do it.

                              ZACH

                    I'm sorry, OK, Miss Mayer?

                              LETTY

                    No, it's not OK. You'll never get

                    to college on OK.

          Letty's fingers press into Zach's arm. A tear slides

          ominously down his cheek.

                                                                   14.

                              LETTY

                    It has to be good, Zach.   Do you

                    understand me?

          Zach wrests free of Letty. He's in full cry now. He backs

          away, stumbles, then makes a run for his seat. Bobby

          SNICKERS at Zach's misfortune. Other children glance around,

          unsure, confused.

          Letty looks vacantly at the children, stares at the board and

          looks at the children again.

          She sits down at her desk and buries her face in her hands.

          Letty's fists, clenched at first, slowly relax. She takes a

          deep breath and raises her head.

                              LETTY

                    I'm very, very sorry, Zach.

          Zach continues to cry. Letty looks down at her desk. She

          grabs a piece of construction paper and a jar of paste.

                              LETTY

                    You know what, guys? Wednesday's

                    not a grammar day. It's a collage

                    day. It's a collage ON THE WALL

                    day.

          Letty jumps up. She slaps the paper on the wall with some

          paste. She motions for the students to join her.

          The children slowly approach her. Zach lags behind.

                              LETTY

                    And, Zach? Zach, I want you to be

                    in charge of paste.

          INT. BEDROOM - LETTY'S APARTMENT - DAY

          Letty lies in bed. The alarm clock BLASTS opera. Letty

          fumbles for the switch. She can't turn it off. She yanks

          out the cord.

          L

          Letty gets out of bed, walks to the dresser and turns off the

          second clock before it rings. She goes to the KITCHEN and

          snaps off the alarm, then heads down the HALLWAY and shuts

          that alarm off, as well.

          Letty hurries back to her BEDROOM and crawls into bed.   Paul,

          toweling his hair dry, walks in.

                                                                  15.

                              PAUL

                    What are you doing?    You're going

                    to be late.

                              LETTY

                    I'm calling in sick.

          Paul sits on the bed and puts his hand to Letty's forehead.

                              PAUL

                    You don't have a fever.

                              LETTY

                    I don't feel like going to work

                    today.

                              PAUL

                    Won't it be hard for them to get a

                    substitute this late?

                              LETTY

                    It'll be OK.

                              PAUL

                    But what about that math project?

                              LETTY

                    Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK

                    with you or am I committing some

                    horrible crime?

                              PAUL

                    Forget I asked.

                               LETTY

                    I'm sorry.

                        (beat)

                    I'm just...I'm so tired lately.

                              PAUL

                    Maybe you ought to see a doctor.

                              LETTY

                    No, it's not like that.

          Letty starts to cry.

                              LETTY

                    It's just I've got those parent

                    conferences, and I'm supposed to

                    set up the math program by next

                    week.

                              (MORE)

                                                                     16.

                              LETTY(cont'd)

                    And shopping for Ruth's dress and

                    that, that engagement dinner.

                              PAUL

                    You can get out of the dinner.

                              LETTY

                    No, I can't. I've already

                    convinced both Mom and Dad to come.

                              PAUL

                    Come on, Letty.   It'll get done.

          Paul touches Letty's shoulder. She pulls away from him.

                              LETTY

                    I don't think so.

                              PAUL

                    Of course it will. Remember the

                    big talent show you planned last

                    year? And what about the Christmas

                    benefit when Santa canceled at the

                    last minute? But you still pulled

                    it off.

                              LETTY

                    Yeah.

                               PAUL

                    You just need to get more

                    organized. L

                              LETTY

                    Maybe.

                              PAUL

                    Let's make a list of the things you

                    need to do, OK?

          Letty nods her head, and Paul grabs a legal pad from his

          briefcase.

          INT. CLASSROOM - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - NIGHT

          MR. and MRS. ANDERSON, over-eager parents, sit across the

          desk from Letty, who stares at the legal pad in her lap. As

          the Andersons talk, Letty twists a lock of hair tighter and

          tighter.

                              MRS. ANDERSON

                    So at home, we've started our own

                    little library for Chandra.

                                                                  17.

                              MR. ANDERSON

                    We thought it would be a good

                    project for her to set up her own

                    card-catalogue.

                              LETTY

                    I see.

          Letty tries unsuccessfully to extricate her hand from her

          hair.

                              MRS. ANDERSON

                    But what I'm wondering is whether

                    we should also be spending more

                    time on her computer skills at

                    home. What do you think?

                              LETTY

                    Well...

                              MR. ANDERSON

                    Because we don't want her to get

                    behind her classmates.

                              MRS. ANDERSON

                    And we trust your opinion.

                    Chandra's always talking about Miss

                    Mayer.

                              LETTY

                    Oh.

                              MR. ANDERSON

                    Just the other day she came home

                    and told us about you taking care

                    of her bloody nose.

                              MRS. ANDERSON

                    And she went on and on about the

                    collage. That seems very

                    inventive, Miss Mayer.

          Letty stares blankly at the couple.

                              MR. ANDERSON

                    Miss Mayer?

                              LETTY

                    What the fuck. It's my job.

          Off Mr. Anderson's raised eyebrow, we

                                                   CUT TO:

                                                                   18.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - LETTY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          The room is a mess of scattered papers and the math Twister

          game. Letty sits on the ground crying. She makes a pyramid

          out of the wadded-up tissues that surround her.

          INT. BRIDAL SHOP - DAY

          The upscale shop is festooned with pastels and lace and lots

          of signs announcing "Sale Day." Frenzied women pick through

          dresses as "Pachelbel's Canon" plays in the background.

          Letty is wedged into a corner, sipping coffee. A CLERK

          approaches her with a coffee pot and tray of pastries.

                              CLERK

                    More coffee?

                              LETTY

                    Hit me.

                              CLERK

                    Danish?

                              LETTY

                        (rooting through the tray)

                    No more bear claws left?

          Ruth bounces into the shop.

                              CLERK

                        (to Ruth)

                    Danish?

                              RUTH

                    Oh, no thanks, I'm too excited to

                    eat.

          The clerk gives Ruth an approving smile as Letty rips into a

          sweet roll. Ruth looks through a nearby rack of gowns.

                              RUTH

                        (to Letty)

                    Where's Mommy?

                              LETTY

                    Do you have to call her Mommy?

                              RUTH

                    Where's the old bag I sometimes

                    call Mommy?

                                                                   19.

                              LETTY

                    She said she'd be here at 10.

          Ruth pulls a dress from the rack and holds it up.

                              RUTH

                    What do you think of this one?

                              LETTY

                    I'd have to see it on.

          Ruth looks closer at Letty.

                              RUTH

                    Have you been crying?    Your eyes

                    are all puffy.

          Letty self-consciously touches her eyes.

                              LETTY

                    Things have been kind of stressful

                    lately.

                              RUTH

                    But everything's OK?

          Ruth is trying on a veil at this point.

                              LETTY

                    Yeah, everything's under control.

                              RUTH

                    What about the engagement party?

                              LETTY

                    Everything's ready for tomorrow

                    night--except the artillery.

                              RUTH

                    Thanks so much for planning it,

                    Letty. Jake's really looking

                    forward to it.

          Letty sighs, moves to the racks and pulls out a dress.

                              LETTY

                    You better start trying on before

                    the vultures get all the good ones.

          INT. DRESSING ROOM - LATER

          R

           uth twirls around in a taffeta gown as Letty picks up

          discarded dresses from the floor and hangs them up.

                                                                  20.

                              RUTH

                    What about this one?

                              LETTY

                        (with sisterly pride)

                    You look beautiful.

                               RUTH

                    Really?

                               LETTY

                    Truly.

          Martha Mayer is led in by the clerk.

                               LETTY

                    Hi, Mom.

                              RUTH

                    Look, Mom, I think I've found the

                    dress.

                              MRS. MAYER

                    You look just wonderful, Ruthie.

                    But I really think you should try

                    on a few more, don't you?

          Letty and Ruth shoot each other a look of doom.

          INT. BRIDAL SHOP - LATER

          A bedraggled Letty and her mother fight the crowds to look at

          dresses. They are bumped and jostled from all sides.

                              MRS. MAYER

                    Has Paul heard about his promotion?

                              LETTY

                    No, not yet. But you know Paul.

                    He's sure to get it.

          Ruth comes out of the dressing room in another gown.

                              MRS. MAYER

                    I don't like the bias cut on that

                    one.

          Mrs. Mayer holds up an ornate dress.

                              RUTH

                    No more. I can't stand to try on

                    one more dress.

                                                                  21.

                              MRS. MAYER

                    Letty, I think this would be

                    beautiful on you.

                                LETTY

                    Oh no.

                              MRS. MAYER

                    Paul could pop the question at any

                    time.

                              LETTY

                    Mom, please.

                              MRS. MAYER

                    Especially with a promotion in the

                    offing.

                              RUTH

                    Go on, Letty. I want to see it on

                    you.

                              LETTY

                        (to Ruth)

                    Do you think I should?

                                RUTH

                    Yes, yes.    It'll be fun.

          Letty takes the gown and disappears into the dressing room.

          INT. BRIDAL SHOP - LATER

          Letty emerges from the dressing room.

                               LETTY

                    Mom?   Mom? Ruth?

          Letty peers around the corner, becoming a tad frantic. But

          neither her mother nor Ruth is to be found. It's just Letty,

          resplendent in ecru satin.

                              CLERK

                    I think they went over to the next

                    shop to take a peek at shoes.

          Letty pushes back her veil, sits down on the floor and takes

          a sip of her now-cold coffee.

                                                                     22.

          INT. LETTY'S LIVING/DINING ROOM - EVENING

          A "House and Garden" picture of elegance. Letty, Paul, Ruth

          and Jake stand at nervous attention, decked out in their

          Sunday best.

          A KNOCK marks the first arrival. Letty opens the door to her

          mother, who does a quick reconnaissance of the room.

                              MRS. MAYER

                    I gather he's late as usual.

                              LETTY

                        (to her mother)

                    Can I get you a glass of champagne?

          The doorbell RINGS. Letty greets her father, a mid 50s

          business type, and his wife MONICA, a younger version of

          Letty's mother.

                              LETTY

                    Hi, Dad, Monica.   I'm so glad you

                    could come.

          Suddenly, the parents are face-to-face, Letty standing

          between them.

                              LETTY

                    Mom, this is Monica.   Monica, my

                    mother, Martha.

          The two Mrs. Mayers make appropriate MURMURS. Letty's

          parents stare each other down. Ruth shifts from foot to foot.

          Silence falls in the room with a thump.

                              LETTY

                    Dad, Mother, you've met before,

                    right?

          Ruth takes a dramatic gulp of air. The evening hangs in the

          balance. Finally,

                              MR. MAYER

                    How've you been, Martha?

          INT. LIVING ROOM - LETTY'S APARTMENT - LATER

          Mr. Mayer and Monica cozy up to each other on the love seat

          while Mrs. Mayer, Ruth and Paul sit on the opposite couch.

          Letty passes hors d'oeuvres, and Jake doles out napkins.

                                                                 23.

                              LETTY

                    It's mushroom-time, folks.

                              MR. MAYER

                        (biting into one)

                    I like the touch of cilantro. It is

                    cilantro, isn't it?

                              LETTY

                    You can always call it, Dad.

                              M

                               ONICA

                    You must get your cooking skills

                    from your father, Letty.

          Uncomfortable silence falls on the party. Monica wipes the

          edge of Mr. Mayer's mouth with her napkin.

                              LETTY

                    Ruth's narrowed the dress hunt down

                    to two, Dad.

                              MR. MAYER

                    Tell me about them.

                              RUTH

                    One's a silk...

                              MRS. MAYER

                    Not in front of Jake, Ruthie.    It's

                    bad luck.

          Ruth looks at Letty nervously.

                              MONICA

                    I remember how hard it was looking

                    for my dress. I must have been to

                    100 stores.

          Mrs. Mayer clears her throat.    More silence.

                               LETTY

                    You know what I think we need?

                    Martinis. How about martinis to

                    celebrate?

                              PAUL

                    Yes.

                              MRS. MAYER

                    That might be nice.

                                                                  24.

                              MR. MAYER

                    As long as you have...

                               LETTY

                    Puglia olives. Would I forget?

                        (beat)

                    A round of martinis coming right

                    up.

          Letty leaves with Paul hot on her heels.

          INT. KITCHEN - SAME

          Letty shakes the martinis while Paul gets out the glasses.

          Ruth enters the kitchen and sidles up to Letty.

                              RUTH

                    How can I help?

                              LETTY

                    Paul, can you hand me the olives?

                    Ruth, I need you to, what was it?

                              RUTH

                    What about the souffle?    Has that

                    gone in?

                              LETTY

                    Yeah, I just put it in. But the

                    squab, I think that needs to be

                    basted.

          Paul hands Letty the olive bottle.

                              PAUL

                        (to Ruth)

                    Kind of icy in there.

                              RUTH

                        (to Paul)

                    Thank God we have alcohol.

          Letty skewers olives and puts them in the martinis. Bits of

          fleck rise from the olives, then swim to the tops of the

          glasses.

                                LETTY

                    Fuck me.

                              RUTH

                    What's the matter?

          Letty grabs the olive bottle.

                                                                  25.

                               PAUL

                    Letty?

          Letty stands still, fixated on the olive bottle.

                               PAUL

                    Let?       L

                              LETTY

                    Olives Aux Herbes De Provence.    I

                    got the wrong kind of olives.

          Ruth holds up a glass.

                              RUTH

                    What's all the dreck?

                              LETTY

                    Sage, rosemary...

                        (in a sarcastic French

                         accent)

                    Les Herbes.

                              RUTH

                    It'll be fine.

                              LETTY

                    No, no. They've got to be Puglia

                    olives, packed in a light brine

                    with a flavor that doesn't

                    overpower the palate.

          Jake enters.   The three turn on him.

                              LETTY/PAUL/RUTH

                    You can't leave them alone./Get

                    back in there./Are you nuts?

          Jake whirls around and exits.

          Letty looks for olives, banging open the cupboards one after

          the other. Quicker and quicker. More and more frantic.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

          Jake, Mr. Mayer, Monica and Mrs. Mayer stare at each other,

          listening with alarm to the wild slamming of cupboards in the

          kitchen.

                              JAKE

                    What do you think of those Lakers?

                                                                     26.

          INT. KITCHEN - SAME

          Letty paws through her purse.

                              PAUL

                    What are you doing?

                              LETTY

                        (wild-eyed)

                    Can you loan me a 20?

                                 PAUL

                    Sure. Why?

                              LETTY

                    I'm going to the store.

                              PAUL

                    I think you're overreacting.

          Letty turns her best school marm look on Paul. He hands over

          a crisp bill.

                               RUTH

                    Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The

                    souffle...

                              LETTY

                    I'll be back before you can say

                    souffle.

          Letty leaves from the kitchen's back door. Ruth heads to the

          living room. Paul leans wearily against the counter,

          savoring one of the herb-filled martinis.

          INT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT

          Fluorescent lights beat down on Letty. She races through the

          aisles. She clutches her keys in one hand, a $20 bill in the

          other. Letty careens around a corner. At the last second,

          she avoids smacking into another shopper. She stops.

          L

          LETTY'S POV:

          Shelf after shelf of olives...black olives...all black.

          BACK TO SCENE:

          Letty darts up and down the aisle, searching, searching.

          Nothing.

                                                                       27.

          Letty scurries to the front of the store. She taps a STORE

          CLERK on the shoulder. Six people waiting in line mutter,

          annoyed.

                              LETTY

                    I can't find martini olives.     All

                    you have are black.

                              STORE CLERK

                        (without looking up)

                    Aisle 2A.

          Letty whips down an aisle.    She starts to sweat.

          An OLD LADY blocks her path.

                              OLD LADY

                    Excuse me, Miss. I can't reach the

                    cat food.

          Letty pauses.    She reaches up and hands the woman a can of

          food.

                              OLD LADY

                    And a turkey and giblets, too,

                    please. She does like her turkey.

          Letty grabs another can, throws it in the Old Lady's cart and

          darts away while the Old Lady continues to talk.

          LETTY'S POV:

          The sign for Aisle 2A.    Olives.   Lots of them.   Green.   All

          shapes. All sizes.

          BACK TO SCENE:

          Letty's shoulders relax.    She scans the shelf.

          LETTY's POV:

          Labels of olives: big, small, with pimentos, without.        None

          from Puglia, Italy.

          BACK TO SCENE:

          Letty zooms back to the front of the store.      To the clerk.

                              LETTY

                    They're not there. I need the ones

                    from Puglia.

                                                                     28.

          She gets no response from the clerk, who counts change for a

          customer. Letty gestures wildly with her hands.

                              LETTY

                    They're the ones that are packed in

                    brine, but they don't overpower

                    the, you know, the palate.

                              STORE CLERK

                        (without looking up)

                    Specialty foods. 7B.

          Letty's off again. To the land of pink peppercorns,

          dehydrated mushrooms and Chinese 5-Spice. But no olives.

          Not a single bottle.

          L

          Letty paws through the shelves, knocking things over as she

          scours the aisle. She is oblivious to the mess that

          surrounds her.

          An EMPLOYEE with a price checker walks half-way down the

          aisle. He spots Letty and rushes away.

                              LETTY

                    Where are they?   Where are they?

          More and more items crash to the ground.   Letty is beyond

          frenzied.

                              EMPLOYEE (OS FILTERED)

                    Manager to 7B. Manager please.

                              LETTY

                    Where are they?

          Letty pounds her fist against the shelf. More goods fall.

          Shoppers stare. The Manager rushes toward Letty.

                              MANAGER

                    What's wrong, Miss?

                              LETTY

                    Tell me where they are.

          She gestures. She knocks over a bottle of fat-free

          Lingonberry preserves. It crashes to the floor, spewing jam.

                              MANAGER

                    I think you should go now.

                              LETTY

                    I need my olives.

                                                                     29.

                              MANAGER

                    It's time to leave.

          The Manager places his hand on the small of Letty's back as

          if to guide her out of the store. Letty backs away. The

          manager grabs hold of her wrist.

          Letty whacks him in the shoulder with her free hand. She

          pushes him away. Hard. He staggers against the opposite

          shelf.

          Customers and employees gather at both ends of the aisle,

          riveted by the spectacle.

                              MANAGER

                    Call security. Where's security,

                    please?

          Letty takes her arm and slides a shelf-full of products onto

          the floor. They crash and break. She screams.

                              LETTY

                    Fucking olives. Fucking, fucking

                    olives.

          Two SECURITY GUARDS turn the corner.   Letty spots them.   One

          creeps closer.

                              LETTY

                    No, no, no. Go away.

          Guard One continues to approach, cooing encouragingly. Letty

          throws a jar at him. It clips him in the head. He turns

          away, bleeding. Guard Two pulls out a billy club.

                              MANAGER

                        (yelling)

                    Call police. Now.

          Letty stops. Dazed. She turns around. Guard Two walks toward

          her. His stance suggests he's stalking a wild animal.

          Letty tries to brush off the jam that dribbles down her

          skirt. She looks to both ends of the aisle.

          LETTY'S POV:

          Faces, dozens and dozens of faces, stare down at her.   People

          point. One boy LAUGHS.

          BACK TO SCENE:

                                                                    30.

          Letty backs against the shelf. She slides down it until she

          is sitting on the floor. She buries her head in her knees,

          sobbing.

                                                           FADE OUT:

          FADE IN:

          INT. LETTY'S ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY

          The room is furnished like a Hyatt Hotel minus anything you

          might use to kill yourself. Letty sleeps.

          MICHAEL, mid 30's, in jeans and T-shirt, sits in a chair next

          to the bed. He looks intently at Letty, checks his watch and

          taps her on the shoulder. She stirs.

                               MICHAEL

                     Miss Mayer? Miss Mayer?

          LETTY'S POV:

          Everything's a morning blur. Gradually, items come into

          focus -- the intercom for the nurse, the door with a window

          in it, the three tissue boxes on the bedside table. It's a

          hospital, all right. Letty's vision is filled suddenly by

          Michael's concerned face peering into hers.

          BACK TO SCENE:

                               MICHAEL

                     I know you've had a rough night,

                     but I have a few questions for you,

                     Miss Mayer, or Letitia.

          Letty pulls herself up to a sitting position.

                               MICHAEL

                     Do you mind if I call you Letitia?

                               LETTY

                     Letty.

                               MICHAEL

                         (consulting his notes)

                     First off, Letty, can you tell me

                     where you are?

                               LETTY

                     I answered these questions last

                     night.

                                                          31.

                              MICHAEL

                    I know this can be a real drag, but

                    the attending physician on day

                    shift is required to do his own

                    prelim exam when a patient is

                    admitted during the night.

                              LETTY

                    Hillview Psychiatric Hospital.

                              MICHAEL

                    Great. Now, Letty, I'd like you to

                    remember three items. I'm going to

                    ask you to repeat them in just a

                    few minutes. They are chair, cup

                    and ball. Did you get that?

          Letty nods.

                              MICHAEL

                    OK, let's subtract 6 from a

                    succession of numbers starting with

                    91.

                              LETTY

                    85.

                              MICHAEL

                    And 85 minus 6?

                              LETTY

                    59.

          Michael waits.

                             LETTY

                    No, 79. Sorry, this makes me

                    nervous.

                              MICHAEL

                    It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind

                    of thing.

          L

          Letty smiles uncomfortably.

                              MICHAEL

                    Now the three things I asked you to

                    remember.

                              LETTY

                    Chair, cup and ball.

                                                          32.

                                MICHAEL

                    Terrific.

          Letty smiles, a real smile this time.

                               MICHAEL

                    Let me shift gears here a minute...

                        (beat)

                    Do you ever hear voices that other

                    people don't hear or see things

                    they don't?

                                LETTY

                    No.

                              MICHAEL

                    What about patterns? Do you find

                    yourself checking and re-checking

                    locks? Or washing your hands over

                    and over again?

          Letty shakes her head "no."

                              MICHAEL

                    How about arranging your

                    possessions in a certain way?

          Letty pauses.

                               MICHAEL

                    Yes?   Go right ahead.

                              LETTY

                    Sometimes my food, and my clothes,

                    and my underwear.

          Michael leans closer.

                              MICHAEL

                    How do you sort it--by lace and

                    cotton?

                                LETTY

                    By color.

                              MICHAEL

                    What if it's got a pattern?

                              LETTY

                    Is this really important? Because

                    I don't think it's a problem.

                                                                   33.

                              MICHAEL

                    I see.

                        (looking at his notes)

                    How long has it been since you've

                    done something you've enjoyed,

                    Letty?

                               LETTY

                        (beat)

                    A while, I guess.

                              MICHAEL

                    That must be really difficult.

          Letty tears up.   Michael puts his hand lightly on her arm.

                              MICHAEL

                    Hey, it'll be OK.   We'll make sure

                    of that.

          Letty gives him an appreciative look.

                              MICHAEL

                    For now, why don't you just take it

                    easy while I confer with my

                    colleagues. A nurse should be in

                    shortly.

          INT. LETTY'S ROOM - LATER

          Letty, dressed and made up, sits rigidly on the bed. She

          writes in her organizer. DR. ROBERT EMLEE, early 40s and in

          jeans, enters with his own organizer.

                              DR. EMLEE

                    Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and

                    I have some questions to ask you...

                              LETTY

                    I did this already.

                              DR. EMLEE

                    It's hospital policy...

                              LETTY

                    To be interviewed every hour?

                              DR. EMLEE

                    I'm the only doctor making rounds

                    this morning.

                                                          34.

                              LETTY

                    Well, I don't have hallucinations.

                    Honest.

                              DR. EMLEE

                    This doctor, was he tall, with dark

                    hair?

                              LETTY

                    Yeah, and a dimple.

          Dr. Emlee shifts uncomfortably.

                               DR. EMLEE

                    I'm afraid Lhe's not a doctor.

                              LETTY

                    Psychologist, therapist, whatever.

                               DR. EMLEE

                    Patient.

                               LETTY

                    What?

                              DR. EMLEE

                    Michael, the man who came to see

                    you, is a patient.

                              LETTY

                    What kind of place is this?

                              DR. EMLEE

                    I apologize for the inconvenience,

                    but I must ask you some...

                              LETTY

                    I want to see my mother

                    immediately.

                              DR. EMLEE

                    We discourage family visits for the

                    first 48 hours after an emotional

                    trauma like the kind you've

                    experienced.

                              LETTY

                    I don't think you understand.    I

                    won't wait.

                                                                    35.

                               DR. EMLEE

                    You'll have to. Your family agreed

                    to the conditions not to see you

                    when they admitted you to Hillview,

                    Letitia.

                        (beat)

                    We can talk about how that makes

                    you feel, but we can't change the

                    rules.

          Letty sinks back on her pillows, the wind knocked out of her.

                              DR. EMLEE

                    Dr. Stone's evaluation from last

                    night indicates you're experiencing

                    a great deal of anxiety, probably

                    related to depression...

          LETTY'S POV:

          Dr. Emlee continues to talk. His words become more and more

          distant as the RINGING in Letty's head grows louder.

                              DR. EMLEE

                    We need to talk about starting you

                    on drug therapy. Most depressive

                    personalities benefit from a drug

                    like Prozac or maybe Zoloft...

          CUT TO:

          INT. REC ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - SAME

          It's a bigger version of a waiting room you'd find in a

          doctor's office. And it has more games.

          Some patients watch television. Others play pool. Several

          form a group around Michael, who holds the same notebook he

          used in his session with Letty. JOHN, unkempt in a bathrobe,

          hands him a few ratty dollar bills.

                              JOHN

                    I'm in for 5 for manic depressive.

          THOMAS, late 40s and in a suit, waves a $5 bill at Michael.

                              THOMAS

                    I'll go with that as well.

          Michael takes the money, and turns to MARIE, late 30s.

                                                                  36.

                               MARIE

                        (to John and Thomas)

                    You two always bet manic

                    depressive.

                        (

                          to Michael)

                    Tell me more about the guard she

                    strangled.

                              MICHAEL

                    No, just hit in the head.

                              JOHN

                    What about voices?    Does she hear

                    voices?

                              MICHAEL

                    Not that she admits to.

                              MARIE

                    Is she a washer?

                               MICHAEL

                    No, but she is exceptionally

                    organized.

                              THOMAS

                    How organized?

                              MICHAEL

                    She arranges her underwear by

                    color.

          Michael motions to MRS. HALLSTROM, mid 50s, who shuffles by.

                              MICHAEL

                    Mrs. Hallstrom, you want in?

                              MRS. HALLSTROM

                    All tapped out.

                              MICHAEL

                    I'll float you.

          Mrs. Hallstrom keeps walking.

                              MARIE

                        (to Michael)

                    It's been weeks since she played.

                              MICHAEL

                    What about you, Marie?

                                                                     37.

                               MARIE

                        (handing Michael a $20

                         bill)

                    I'll say major depression

                    complicated by obsessive compulsive

                    disorder.

                        (beat)

                    And could I get my change in ones?

          INT. HALLWAY - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - NIGHT

          Letty lags behind NURSE GATES, early 30s and in civilian

          clothes, as they walk down the hall.

                              NURSE GATES

                    Treatment schedules are posted on

                    the bulletin board. Dinner at 6,

                    lights out at 10 and no

                    fraternizing between patients.

          Letty nods.

                              NURSE GATES

                        (pointing as she goes)

                    That's the rec room. We show

                    movies there on Wednesdays and

                    Fridays...And this is the dining

                    hall.

          Letty stops in her tracks at the sight of the room, an

          upscale version of a college cafeteria. Groups of people eat

          and talk. A paper airplane sails from one table to another.

                              LETTY

                    I'm really not that hungry.

                              NURSE GATES

                    Just eat whatever you want. This

                    will give you a chance to meet some

                    people.

                              LETTY

                    You know, my mom's coming to get me

                    tomorrow. I'll be leaving.

                              NURSE GATES

                    It's OK, Letty. I'll be right here

                    with you.

          INT. DINING HALL - SAME

          Nurse Gates guides Letty to a table where John, Mrs.

          Hallstrom, Marie and Thomas sit.

                                                                  38.

                              THOMAS

                    So I said to my publisher this

                    afternoon, I said, don't you even--

                              NURSE GATES

                        (interrupts)

                    Hi, gang. I want to introduce you

                    to Letty.

                        (to Letty)

                    Letty, this is Mrs. Hallstrom and

                    Marie, and John and Thomas.

                              THOMAS

                        (to Letty)

                    Just discussing my pesky publisher.

                    May I ask what you do when you're

                    not vacationing?

                              MARIE

                        (to Thomas)

                    Let the poor girl get some food,

                    for Heaven's sake.

                              LETTY

                    I'm a teacher.

                              THOMAS

                    As you may have gathered, I'm a

                    writer.

          John snorts. Thomas ignores him.   Mrs. Hallstrom stares down

          at her plate.

                              THOMAS

                    I don't like to say novelist. That

                    sounds a little grandiose, but I am

                    on my third novel and...

                              NURSE GATES

                    Excuse me for interrupting, Thomas,

                    but we really should get some

                    food...

          Nurse Gates leads Letty to a table, and hands her a plate.

          Letty looks up to see Michael at the other end of the table,

          doing a card trick for two OTHER PATIENTS.

                              MICHAEL

                        (to patients)

                    Now I'm going to say that the card

                    you picked was the Ace of Spades.

                                                                       39.

          He flips the top card up and it's the Ace of Spades.       The

          patients chortle.

                                 NURSE GATES

                    Michael.

          Michael turns toward the nurse.

                              NURSE GATES

                    Michael, this is Letty.      She just

                    arrived yesterday.

          Letty stares at Michael coldly.

                               LETTY

                    We've met.

                        (to Michael)

                    I missed you during rounds this

                    morning.

          Letty turns and leaves, carrying her empty plate with her.

                              NURSE GATES

                        (to Michael)

                    This doctor thing has got to stop.

          Nurses Gates hurries after Letty.

          EXT. HALLWAY - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY

          Letty stands outside the waiting room door.       She tucks her

          blouse into her jeans and enters.

          INT. WAITING ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY

          Letty's mother sits on the edge of a couch in a room that

          looks much like the library of an English country manor. She

          springs up as soon as she spots Letty. They rush to each

          other. Letty's mother strokes her hair.

                               M

                               RS. MAYER

                    I'm here, Sweetheart.      I'm here.

                    It's going to be OK.

                                 LETTY

                    I'm sorry.     I'm so sorry.

                              MRS. MAYER

                    Oh, Letty, what happened?

                              LETTY

                    Mom, I was there, and I just, I was

                    so...

                              (MORE)

                                                          40.

                              LETTY(cont'd)

                    They didn't have the olives, and I,

                    I got so upset. I don't know how it

                    happened.

                              MRS. MAYER

                    I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he

                    says...

                               LETTY

                    I'm so glad to see you. You can't

                    believe the people in here.

                    They've got patients posing as

                    doctors...

                              MRS. MAYER

                    Everyone says it's the best

                    facility in the area for this sort

                    of thing.

                              LETTY

                    I just want to go home.   Can we go

                    home now?

                              MRS. MAYER

                    I think the best thing for you

                    right now is to stay here and get

                    well.

                              LETTY

                    Maybe I should talk about this with

                    Ruth, or Paul.

                              MRS. MAYER

                    We all agree with the doctor, Dear.

                    He thinks it's safer for you to

                    stay here for a while.

          Letty listens, waits, can't absorb it.

                              LETTY

                    You all really think I need to be

                    here?

                              MRS. MAYER

                    Yes.

                              LETTY

                    But what about Beast?   Who'll...?

                              MRS. MAYER

                    Ruth's already taken him home.

                                                                    41.

                              LETTY

                    And my class. It'll be hard to

                    find a good substitute. And what

                    about my math program?

                               MRS. MAYER

                    Paul said he'd call the school.

                        (beat)

                    And your father thinks he's

                    convinced the guard not to press

                    charges as long as you get help.

                                LETTY

                    Charges?

                              MRS. MAYER

                    For his injuries. I guess you...I

                    guess he got hit in the head.

          Mrs. Mayer holds out a duffel bag to Letty.

                              MRS. MAYER

                    I packed up some of your clothes,

                    and I can bring whatever else you

                    need.

          Letty refuses to accept the duffel bag. Her mother sets it

          on the floor and stands. Letty is five again.

                              LETTY

                    Mom, no, please don't go.    Please.

          Letty's mother holds her. Mrs. Mayer, crying, pulls away

          from Letty. She kisses her daughter on the cheek.

                              MRS. MAYER

                    I'll see you soon.

                                LETTY

                    Tomorrow?

                              MRS. MAYER

                    As soon as Dr. Emlee says.

          Letty's mother walks out the door.    Letty stares after her.

          INT. LETTY'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Letty, crying, unpacks her duffel bag, laboriously smoothing

          and refolding every item she puts in the drawer.

          Finishing her task, Letty goes to the mirror and stares at

          her reflection. Finally, she fixes her makeup.

                                                                    42.

          Letty leaves her room. We follow her FOOTSTEPS down the

          hallway. In the distance, Letty sees the Rec Room. She

          hears the CLAMOR of voices. Every step is agony.

          Letty stops herself just before entering, trying to collect

          herself.

                              MICHAEL (O.S.)

                    Four people bet OCD and clinical

                    depression so I split the pool.

                              JOHN (O.S.)

                    Yeah, her diagnosis was no mystery.

                              MARIE

                    Especially the OCD.

          Sick realization spreads over Letty's face.

                              JOHN (O.S.)

                    Fuck, I mean, anyone who color-

                    codes her panties has big problems.

          Letty freezes. Michael rounds the corner. He stops when he

          sees her, falters, recovers his composure.

                              MICHAEL

                    Hey there. They're showing

                    "Groundhog Day" if you...

                              LETTY

                    You took bets on my diagnosis?

                              MICHAEL

                    It's no big deal.   We all compare.

                              LETTY

                        (voice rising)

                    W

                     ho do you think you are?

          INT. REC ROOM - SAME

          Patients are grouped in front of the TV, watching Bill

          Murray. Heads turn as they hear shouting in the hallway.

          Not even a moment's hesitation before, one by one, they get

          up and hurry to the hall. Only Mrs. Hallstrom remains.

          INT. HALLWAY - SAME

          John, Marie and others gather around the fighters.

                              MICHAEL

                    Don't take it personally.

                                                                    43.

                              LETTY

                    You have no right, no right to take

                    the worst thing that's ever

                    happened to me and make it into

                    some kind of game.

                              MICHAEL

                    Stop acting like you're someone

                    special. You're just like the rest

                    of us.

                              LETTY

                    I'm not the one who's masquerading

                    as a doctor. I'm not the one

                    who's, who's...

                              JOHN

                        (to Letty)

                    He's schizophrenic.

                              LETTY

                    I'm not the one who's

                    schizophrenic. I don't see people

                    who aren't there or run around

                    acting crazy.

          Letty pounds her fist against the wall.

                              PATIENTS

                    Go, Girl!/ Come on, Michael.

                              MICHAEL

                    Oh, no, you're perfectly sane.

                    That's why you're here.

          Letty looks like she's been slapped. She thinks for a

          moment. The patients wait, breathless, for her retort.

                              LETTY

                    Go fuck yourself.

          Michael grins at Letty. She turns, and strides down the

          hall. There's a smattering of applause. It grows stronger.

          We see Letty's eyes fill with tears as, behind her, the

          patients yell.

                              PATIENTS

                    Bravo./Encore./Re-match.

                                                                  44.

          INT. LETTY'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Letty, unable to sleep, tosses and turns. She gets out of

          bed and paces the room nervously, trying to hold herself

          together. She slumps to the floor and starts to cry.

          INT. GROUP THERAPY ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY

          D

           r. Emlee and seven patients sit in a circle of metal folding

          chairs. Michael, who sits next to Emlee, practices rolling a

          quarter back and forth across his fingers.

          Letty sits across from Michael and Emlee, her legs and arms

          crossed tightly. The group concentrates on Mrs. Hallstrom.

                              MRS. HALLSTROM

                    I can't stop thinking about the

                    things I did wrong when my daughter

                    was little.

                              DR. EMLEE

                    And how's that make you feel?

                              MRS. HALLSTROM

                    I just feel like sleeping.    All the

                    time.

                              THOMAS

                    Hell's bells, you can count me in

                    on that. I haven't had enough Z's

                    since I ran those sleep disorder

                    experiments at Stanford back in the

                    70s.

                              MARIE

                    We really miss doing things with

                    you, Mrs. Hallstrom.

          Michael, sitting next to Mrs. Hallstrom, squeezes her arm.

                              MRS. HALLSTROM

                    Maybe when I hit my manic phase

                    again.

          Group members smile.

                              JOHN

                    I've noticed Letty doesn't much

                    like to do things with us.

          The group looks expectantly at Letty.

                                                                   45.

                              LETTY

                    Oh, no. Of course I do.

                              JOHN

                    Then why are you so defensive?

                              MICHAEL

                        (to John)

                    I don't think we need to sacrifice

                    Letty to pep up a slow session.

                              JOHN

                        (to Michael)

                    You're the one who told everyone

                    about her panties.

          Michael grimaces at John.   Letty's head is bent down.

                              DR. EMLEE

                    Maybe you'd like to share some of

                    your feelings about OCD or

                    depression with us, Letty.

          Letty eyes the doctor.   She's dangerously close to tears.

                              LETTY

                    Do we have to talk about this?

                              DR. EMLEE

                    I think in the spirit of group

                    therapy, it's beneficial for each

                    of us to open ourselves up to the

                    others.

          Michael reaches his hand behind Dr. Emlee's head, catching

          Letty's eye in the process. Michael pulls a silver dollar out

          of Emlee's ear.

          Letty looks but doesn't respond. The other patients ignore

          Michael. Emlee is oblivious.

                              DR. EMLEE

                    You never know, Letty, how the

                    person sitting next to you may be

                    able to shed light on one of your

                    problems...

          Michael goes for a bigger trick. Reaching again behind the

          doctor's head, he produces a small bouquet of paper flowers.

          Letty, almost against her will, smiles.

                                                                  46.

                              DR. EMLEE

                    ...by revealing something that's

                    going on in his or her own life.

          Michael waves the flowers back and forth behind the doctor's

          head. Letty's smile broadens.

                              DR. EMLEE

                        (responding to her smile)

                    There, now, I knew you'd feel

                    better once we discussed group

                    process. Let's talk a little about

                    your OCD.

          INT. LIBRARY - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY

          Letty ponders a shelf of ratty paperbacks. Michael turns the

          corner, thumbing through a dog-eared book. Letty spots him

          and moves away. Michael sidles up next to her.

                               M

                               ICHAEL

                    Looking for a romance?

                                 LETTY

                    Excuse me?

                              MICHAEL

                    What are you looking to read?

                              LETTY

                    Anything interesting.

          Michael holds out his book to her.

                              MICHAEL

                    This is good.

          Letty glances at the title, "101 MAGIC TRICKS."

                              LETTY

                    But you're checking it out.

                              MICHAEL

                    I've already checked it out 17

                    times.

          Michael reaches behind Letty. She pulls away. He produces a

          scarf from behind her back, and presents it to her. She

          doesn't take it.

                              LETTY

                    You keep the book.   I'm looking for

                    Emily Dickinson.

                                                                   47.

          Letty walks away.   Michael follows.

                              MICHAEL

                    Hey, if you take the magic book,

                    I'll feel like maybe you accept my

                    apology and don't hate me anymore.

          Letty hesitates.

                              LETTY

                    I haven't heard an apology.

          Michael drops to one knee.

                              MICHAEL

                    I'm really sorry I hurt your

                    feelings. I got a little carried

                    away. Can you ever forgive me?

          Letty takes the book from him and walks away.

          INT. REC ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY

          Letty sits in an arm chair staring out at the garden. Her

          attention is drawn to a nearby couch where Michael sits

          opposite Mrs. Hallstrom, apparently playing cards.

          Michael lays a card down.

                              MICHAEL

                    Mrs. Hallstrom, I'm pretty sure you

                    could use that.

          She shakes her head slowly back and forth.   Michael places it

          in her hand of cards.

                               MICHAEL

                    Now, don't you have a gin rummy,

                    Mrs. Hallstrom?

                        (beat)

                    Go ahead, now, just lay those cards

                    down.

          Mrs. Hallstrom slowly spreads her hand of cards on the couch.

                              MICHAEL

                    Hot damn. Gin rummy. I told you

                    so. You're three games up on me.

          Mrs. Hallstrom smiles. Michael catches Letty watching them,

          and Letty quickly looks away.

                                                                  48.

          INT. LETTY'S ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - NIGHT

          Letty opens her drawer to pull out a T-shirt. Several are

          rumpled. She starts refolding them when she spots it.

          There, nestled among her clothes, is a book of Emily

          Dickinson's poetry. Letty picks it up, runs her hand over

          the cover and starts reading.

          EXT. COURTYARD - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY

          Paul and Letty walk onto a postcard-perfect stone terrace

          overlooking the garden. Paul pulls up a chair for Letty and

          stares out at the scenery.

                              PAUL

                    It's prettier here than I thought

                    it would be.

                              LETTY

                    Yeah, I guess it's all right.

                              PAUL

                    Are you all right?

                              LETTY

                    That's a big question.

                              PAUL

                    I hope it wasn't something I did.

                              LETTY

                    Something you did?

                              PAUL

                    That put you in here.

                               LETTY

                    Of course not, no.

                        (beat)

                    Is that why you're here?

                              PAUL

                    I think we need to talk about some

                    things.

                              LETTY

                    Yes, I suppose so.

                              PAUL

                    This has been really difficult,

                    this whole thing.

                              (MORE)

                                                                     49.

                               PAUL(cont'd)

                    These past few weeks, it's made me

                    really go back and examine our

                    whole relationship.

                        (beat)

                    I mean, we've been going out for

                    four years, and it hasn't always

                    been so easy.

                              LETTY

                    No.

                              PAUL

                    Especially this last year.

                              LETTY

                        (softly)

                    Especially now.

                              PAUL

                    So, I've been thinking a lot...

                              LETTY

                    I have too, Paul.

                              PAUL

                    I talked to Ruth a little bit, and

                    I think it's about time...

                              LETTY

                    I know. We can't just keep going

                    through the motions.

                               PAUL

                    Exactly. It's time to make

                    decisions.

                              LETTY

                    You don't have to say anything

                    else. I've known for a while that

                    this was coming.

                              PAUL

                    I just wish we'd done it sooner.

          Paul takes Letty's hand in his.

                              PAUL

                    Will you marry me?

          Paul pulls a diamond ring from his pocket and puts it on

          Letty's finger. She stares at it, mesmerized.

                                                            50.

                              PAUL

                    I had to smuggle it in here. I

                    guess you're not really supposed to

                    have jewelry.

                              LETTY

                        (by rote)

                    Or be up past ten or fraternize

                    with other patients.

                                PAUL

                    I hope you like it. It's a Marquis

                    cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with

                    emeralds around it, but this was

                    simpler, more classic in its lines.

                         (beat)

                    L

                     Letty?

                              LETTY

                    It's, it's really nice, Paul.

                              PAUL

                    You can take it back and we can

                    have one custom made if you want.

                              LETTY

                    No, you've done a perfect job.

                              PAUL

                    So, what do you say, Let?

          Letty looks him in the eyes for the first time.

                              LETTY

                    Do you think, really, that it's OK

                    to get engaged when I'm in here?

                              PAUL

                    Sure. We'll save the formal

                    announcement for when you're out. I

                    already told your mother. I hope

                    you don't mind.

                              LETTY

                    No, no.

                              PAUL

                    So will you?

                              LETTY

                        (working up a smile)

                    Of course. Yes. I will.     I do.

                                                                   51.

          Paul and Letty kiss, then hug.

          EXT. COURTYARD - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - LATER

          It's completely dark. Letty sits in the same position we saw

          her in hours ago. Michael walks up to her.

                              MICHAEL

                    You missed out on some great

                    broccoli florets at dinner.

                              LETTY

                    I wasn't hungry.

                              MICHAEL

                    John even managed to lob a load of

                    mashed potatoes into Mrs.

                    Hallstrom's milk.

                              LETTY

                        (smiling)

                    Finally. I was getting tired of

                    watching him try every night.

                              MICHAEL

                    Was it bad news--the visit from

                    Peter?

                              LETTY

                    Paul.

                              MICHAEL

                    He looked pretty serious.

                              LETTY

                    He asked me to marry him.

                              MICHAEL

                    Very romantic setting.

                              LETTY

                    It was romantic.   He's very

                    romantic.

                              MICHAEL

                    So are you engaged, or what?

          Letty holds out her hand, where the diamond glistens. Michael

          bends forward to look at the ring, caressing her hand as he

          does so.

          Letty pulls away. The ring is gone.

                                                                    52.

                              LETTY

                    What have you done with the ring?

                              MICHAEL

                    It's magic.

          Letty stands up.

                              LETTY

                    This isn't funny.   Paul would kill

                    me.

          Michael holds his hands in fists toward Letty.

                              MICHAEL

                    Guess which hand.

                              LETTY

                    Enough with the abracadabra.

                              MICHAEL

                    Guess.

                              LETTY

                    T

                     he left one.

          Michael opens his hand.   It's empty.   Michael addresses an

          imaginary audience.

                              MICHAEL

                        (to audience)

                    The fair maiden guesses

                    incorrectly. Should we give her

                    one more try?

                        (to Letty)

                    The audience says one more try.

                    What guess you now?

                              LETTY

                    The right one.

          Michael opens his right hand. A plastic, Cracker-jack ring

          rests in it.

                              LETTY

                    Come on, Michael.

          Michael grabs Letty's hand and slides the ring onto her

          finger.

                              MICHAEL

                    With this ring, I thee...

                                                                 53.

          Letty pulls her hand away.

                              LETTY

                    Really, this isn't funny.

                              MICHAEL

                    OK, OK, I'll give it back.

          Letty holds out her hand.

                              MICHAEL

                    For a price.

                                 LETTY

                    Good God.

                              MICHAEL

                    A small price.

                              LETTY

                    I won't do your portion of kitchen

                    cleanup.

                                 MICHAEL

                    No.

                              LETTY

                    And I'm not covering for you when

                    you sneak out to call Dominos.

                              MICHAEL

                    I want a kiss.

          Letty stares at him.    She laughs.

                              LETTY

                    Get serious.

          Michael moves close to her.

                              MICHAEL

                    I'm serious.

          Letty looks into his eyes.

                              LETTY

                        (softly)

                    Everything's a joke with you.

          Michael and Letty kiss, long and deep. Letty pulls back.

          She gazes at Michael. She steps closer to him.

          They kiss again, longer and deeper.

                                                                   54.

          They separate. Letty looks ready for another kiss.   Michael

          caresses her cheek.

          He walks back toward the hospital door. He stops, comes back

          to Letty. He hands her the diamond ring.

                               MICHAEL

                    Here.

          He walks inside.   Letty watches him go.

          INT. DR. EMLEE'S OFFICE - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY

          Dr. Emlee and Letty sit across from each other.

                              LETTY

                    The medicine's still bothering me.

                    It feels like I have cotton wrapped

                    around my brain.

                                DR. EMLEE

                    We'll see about adjusting the

                    dosage if that doesn't clear in the

                    next (week.

                          beat)

                    How are other things going?

                              LETTY

                    I think I've told you all the news.

                    Let's see--the engagement. Oh, and

                    my sister's coming to visit me, and

                    they say my cat misses me.

                              DR. EMLEE

                    The question, Letty, is how are you

                    feeling?

                              LETTY

                    I miss Beast a lot, too.

          INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - NIGHT

          Darkness. Michael sleeps. A Christmas Carol BLASTS through

          the intercom system.

                              INTERCOM

                    Hark the Herald Angels sing...

          Michael bolts awake. He stumbles out of bed, in wildly

          striped boxers, and races toward the hall.

                                                                     55.

          INT.   HALLWAY - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - SAME

          Doors open like kernels of popcorn exploding.   Michael,

          Marie, Thomas, John, then Letty.

          The music BLARES on. Nurse Gates runs down the hall and

          shouts to Michael.

                               NURSE GATES

                     What are you doing?

                               MICHAEL

                         (yelling)

                     Not me.

          The music lowers. Mrs. Hallstrom, in a Santa cap, appears.

          She distributes erasers as she threads through the patients.

                                MRS. HALLSTROM

                     Sorry, sorry. Candy canes are out

                     of season.

                               NURSE GATES

                     Mrs. Hallstrom?

          Mrs. Hallstrom gives an eraser to the nurse.

                                NURSE GATES

                     Come on. Come with me, Mrs.

                     Hallstrom.

          Nurse Gates leads Mrs. Hallstrom away as the older woman

          continues tossing erasers down the hall.

          Marie stares at Michael's shorts.

                               MARIE

                     Hot boxers.

          Michael smiles awkwardly at Letty. She returns to her room.

          INT. LETTY'S ROOM - SAME

          Letty climbs into bed. She opens the bedside drawer, and

          pulls out a Tiffany's ring box. There, cradled in the satin

          lining, is the diamond from Paul. Right beside it is

          Michael's Cracker Jack special.

          L

          Letty puts on Paul's ring. She studies her hand. With an air

          of secrecy, she slips on Michael's ring. She quickly takes

          it off. Wearing Paul's ring, she turns off the light and

          snuggles into bed.

                                                                  56.

          EXT. GARDEN, HILLV IEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY

          Afternoon light casts long shadows in the garden of pruned

          hedges and tea roses. Letty and Ruth power-walk down a

          cobblestone path, heading away from the English Tudor

          hospital that looms large in the background.

          Letty wears a sweatshirt emblazoned with the logo for the

          University of South Carolina Cocks.

                               LETTY

                    I can't believe you finally gave me

                    the shirt.

                              RUTH

                    Loaned you. And it's only 'til you

                    get out of here.

                              LETTY

                    That settles it. I'm never leaving.

                              RUTH

                    I can hardly wait 'til you're free.

                    Planning the wedding without you

                    has been a disaster.

                              LETTY

                    You're slowing.

                              RUTH

                        (picking up the pace)

                    Mom and I fought for 20 minutes

                    over whether we should go with ecru

                    invitations or brilliant white.

          Letty checks her stop watch.

                              RUTH

                    What do you think?

                              LETTY

                    Ecru.

                              RUTH

                    And then the gold scroll or the

                    black Romanesque print?

          Letty completely stops and faces Ruth.

                              LETTY

                    Do we have to talk wedding details?

                                                                   57.

                              RUTH

                    Oh, no, of course not.

                              LETTY

                    I mean, you can always send me

                    fabric samples to look at or

                    pictures of dresses. But, it's

                    been so long since we've seen each

                    other.

                              RUTH

                    Of course. You're right. Besides,

                    we should be talking about your

                    engagement.

          They start walking again.

                              LETTY

                    Tell me more about Beast beating up

                    that other cat.

                                RUTH

                    Bloody furry mess, like I said.

                        (beat)

                    Aren't you so excited about Paul?

                        (

                          beat)

                    Letty?

          Ruth stops this time.

                              RUTH

                    What's going on with you, Letty?

                              LETTY

                    Ruthie, do you ever wonder if

                    you'll meet someone else...someone

                    besides Jake?

          Power walking's forgotten.   Ruth and Letty start to amble.

                              RUTH

                    What's his name, Letty?

                              LETTY

                    I didn't say...

                              RUTH

                    Don't even try.    What's his name?

          INT. LETTY'S ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - NIGHT

          Nurse Gates passes by the open door, and pokes her head in.

                                                                   58.

                              NURSE GATES

                    Lights out, Letty.

          Letty closes the door. She pulls a nightshirt from a drawer,

          disrupting a perfectly-folded T-shirt. Letty bends down to

          straighten it, but changes her mind. She shuts the drawer.

          Letty puts on the nightshirt, crawls into bed and snaps off

          the light. She fluffs her pillow, and turns over. She rolls

          back.

          Letty turns on the light. She goes to the drawer, opens it,

          pulls out the T-shirt and refolds it. She shuts the drawer.

          Letty yanks open the drawer again and looks at her handiwork.

          It's a fight with the drawer. Opened and closed. Until Letty

          takes a deep breath, pulls it open a final time, hesitantly

          ruffles the T-shirt and slams the drawer shut.

          She runs to bed and hops in, turning off the light and

          burying her head under the pillow.

          A few moments pass.

          A KNOCK on the door. Letty opens it to find Michael.

                              LETTY

                    We're supposed to be asleep.

                                MICHAEL

                    Exactly.

          Michael takes Letty's hand and pulls her toward the door.

                              LETTY

                    We'll get caught.

                              MICHAEL

                    No rounds for another three hours.

          Michael checks the hallway and pulls Letty into it.

                              MICHAEL

                    Nervous? Scared? Worried you're

                    not fit for a caper of epic

                    proportions?

                              L

                              LETTY

                    Don't be ridiculous.

                              MICHAEL

                    Rendezvous at the closet in 30.

                                                                  59.

          Letty forges ahead to the nurses' station, while Michael

          turns a corner in the hall, peeking out so he can watch Letty

          approach Nurse Gates.

          NURSES' STATION - SAME

                              NURSE GATES

                    Letty, you should be in bed.

                              LETTY

                    There's a spider in my room.

                              NURSE GATES

                    Yeah?

                              LETTY

                    It's got a green dot on its back.

                    I can't go to sleep with it

                    watching me.

                              NURSE GATES

                    Sounds awful. I guess we better

                    check it out.

          Letty and Nurse Gates walk down the hall to Letty's room,

          passing the alcove where Michael lurks in the shadows. He

          sneaks into the main hall and pads up to the nurses' station.

          Michael wanders around the desk, crouches on the floor so he

          can't be seen from the hallway and pulls the phone down to

          his level. He dials.

                               MICHAEL

                    Extra large pepperoni and

                    mushrooms.

          Michael reaches up to a hook and grabs a white lab coat. He

          puts on the coat, which identifies him as "Val Williams."

                    Mottled really.   Green and red.

          Nurse Gates looks Letty squarely in the eye.

                    I don't know why you feel you have

          Michael pays the DOMINO'S PIZZA MAN and tries to walk past

          the guard, JIM, who blocks his path.

                              JIM

                    I'm afraid I can't let you take

                    that in without the proper invoice.

                              MICHAEL

                    It's a pizza.

                    All the same, rules are rules.

                    You don't understand. This is a

                    very important, very special,

                    morale-boosting pizza.

                              JIM

                    What I understand is how low morale

                    gets when you're posted at a guard

                    station all night, Val.

          Reluctantly, Michael opens the pizza box, and Jim helps

          himself to two slices. Michael starts to shut the box. Jim

          reaches in for a third slice.

          Letty and Nurse Gates sit cross-legged on the bed, facing

          each other. Letty's face is puffy from crying.

                              LETTY

                    I don't mean to go on and on like

                    It's OK.   It's good to let it out.

          Michael passes the open door with the pizza box and points

          down the hall. Letty stares right through him.

                              NURSE GATES

                    Did you ever tell Paul how you

                    felt?

                    He was graduating from law school,

                    and he just assumed I was OK with

                    dropping out.

                    We never really talked about it.

          The pizza, cokes and a candle sit in the middle of the floor,

          which Michael has draped with a sheet. Michael stares at the

          dwindling candle.                                  C

          Nurse Gates nods sympathetically.

                              LETTY

                    Is that so wrong?

          Michael passes the open door again, waving his hands wildly

          to attract Letty's attention. She doesn't notice him.

                    Yes, of course. Whenever you want.

          Letty gives Nurse Gates a hug.

          INT. LINEN CLOSET - SAME

          TAPS on the door. Michael looks up. He jumps to his feet

          and lets Letty in, gesturing for her to sit. They lean

          against a stack of pillows.

                              LETTY

                    Sorry I'm late...

          Michael puts his finger to Letty's lips.

                                 MICHAEL

                    Shhh.

          A SERIES OF SHOTS THAT FADE INTO EACH OTHER:

          A.) The two munch on pizza. Michael picks off black olives

          and hands them to Letty, who plops them on top of her pizza.

          B.) Michael hands Letty a cigarette. She gestures no.       He

          lights one for himself and begins blowing smoke rings.

          C.) Michael offers Letty pizza.     She clutches her stomach to

          show that she's full.

          D.) Letty indicates she wants a cigarette. Michael

          demonstrates how to smoke, affecting the style of a 1930s

          movie star. Letty follows suit.

          E

           .) Letty grabs a pillow and hits Michael over the head. He

          pulls the pillow away from her. Letty stands up, grabs

          another pillow and hits Michael again. He whacks her in the

          back of the knees and she falls on top of him.

          Enough of the fighting.    They kiss.   Michael strokes the back

          of Letty's neck.

          FOOTSTEPS approach the door and stop. Michael and Letty stop

          kissing and look at the door. The FOOTSTEPS continue on.

          Michael pulls Letty's shirt up. She starts to pull it over

          her head, but can't get it all the way off in the cramped

          space. Michael kisses Letty's mouth through the shirt. She

          GIGGLES. Michael helps Letty off with the shirt.

          He kisses her chest.    Letty bites him lightly on the

          shoulder.

          Michael pulls away in surprise, grinning. Letty reaches up

          and bites him again. Michael bites her back.

                                                                      64.

          Letty reaches her hands behind her head, searching for

          something to hold onto. She grabs a stack of sheets, which

          topple onto Michael.

          Michael sits up, trying to clear the sheets off himself and

          Letty. Letty pushes him down and crawls on top of him.

          Marie enters with her toothbrush and toothpaste.   She moves

          Letty sits on the couch.   Emlee leans forward in his chair.

                               DR. EMLEE

                     I think it's a problem that you

                     never told me about Michael. I had

                     to hear it from another patient.

                               LETTY

                     I couldn't really say anything

                     because of that fraternizing rule.

                               DR. EMLEE

                     Well, Letty, this does present a

                     liability issue for the hospital.

                               LETTY

                     I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I

                     can take care of myself.

                               D

                                R. EMLEE

                     What about Michael? Do you know

                     the extent of his...

                               LETTY

                     I know Michael's a schizophrenic,

                     and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic-

                     depressive, and John Lockyer has

                     episodes of psychosis, and I heard

                     a rumor that you suffer from

                     delusions of grandeur.

                               DR. EMLEE

                     Go ahead and put the guard back up,

                     Letty. But you need to know what

                     you're dealing with.

                               LETTY

                     I don't need a lecture.   I care

                     about Michael.

                               DR. EMLEE

                     Then that's even more reason to

                     listen. Look, schizophrenics tend

                     to withdraw from reality. They

                     experience emotional disturbances

                     that result in personality changes.

                    You could be lying next to Michael

                    in bed one night, and he could have

                    a hallucination, or a delusion. It

                    might happen when you're driving

                    or...

                    Look, I know he's almost through

                    with treatment here. And, he's on

                    medication.

                               DR. EMLEE

                    Drugs can help suppress symptoms.

                    But lots of patients stop taking

                    them when they're on their own

                    because the side effects are so

                    harsh.

                    And, Michael's condition is often

                    worsened by periods of stress. He's

                    I'd like you to promise you won't

                    carry on a relationship with

                    Michael. Otherwise, I'll consider

                    moving one of you to another ward.

                              LETTY

                    First you tell me to do what I want

                    to, then you tell me to stop.

                              DR. EMLEE

                    All I want you to do is think about

                    what's best for you. Really think

                    about it.

          EXT. GROUNDS - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY

          Letty lies in the middle of a copse of trees, reading Emily

          Dickinson. Michael walks up and hands her a dandelion.

                              MICHAEL

                    A daisy for the lady.

                              LETTY

                    The lady knows this is a dandelion.

                              MICHAEL

                    A rose is a rose.

                                                            67.

          Letty kisses him on the cheek.

                                LETTY

                    Thanks.    Where've you been all day?

                              MICHAEL

                    Back-to-back sessions with the

                    shrink.

                              LETTY

                    Sounds important.

                              MICHAEL

                    I'm not allowed to see you anymore.

                                LETTY

                    Really?    Me too.

                              MICHAEL

                    I had to sneak by the guards to get

                    here. They say you're highly

                    unstable, have a depressive

                    personality, and may hold back my

                    own recovery.

                                LETTY

                    Wow.    I'm bad news.

                              MICHAEL

                    What's my rap?

                               LETTY

                    Schizophrenic recidivism marked by

                    hallucinations and paranoid

                    delusions.

                                MICHAEL

                    Fuck.    That's all true.

          Letty laughs.

                              MICHAEL

                    Really, though. My thoughts go

                    haywire sometimes.

                              LETTY

                    What are the delusions like?

                               MICHAEL

                    I think people are after me, crap

                    like that.

                              MICHAEL(cont'd)

                    When I was 18, my mom came home and

                    found me sitting naked on the

                    kitchen table. I thought I was God.

          He waits for Letty to register the information.

                              MICHAEL

                    Shocking, huh?

                              LETTY

                    Sure. But I took out a whole

                    grocery store.

                              MICHAEL

                    I wish I could have seen that.

                              LETTY

                    I'm starting to think that

                    everyone's crazy to some extent.

                               MICHAEL

                    M

                     y Grandma Rosa says that some

                    trees get planted in rich top soil,

                    and they grow right up to the sun,

                    tall and straight. Other trees,

                    they start as seeds in the crevices

                    between rocks so they have to twist

                    and bend to reach the light.

                        (beat)

                    But even though they end up

                    crooked, they're still trees, just

                    like the straight ones.

          Lying on their backs, Michael and Letty stare up at the

          leaves overhead.

                              MICHAEL

                        (with a start)

                    Why in the world did you let me

                    start talking in metaphors? That's

                    no way for us to break up.

                                LETTY

                    Break up?    They wish.

          Michael and Letty hug.

          INT. NURSES' STATION - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY

          Nurse Gates pours tablets from a potpourri of pill bottles

          into little paper cups. A Federal Express delivery man with

          a bunch of boxes stops at the station.

                                                                  69.

                              DELIVERY MAN

                    I need a signature, please.

          Nurse Gates looks at the form.

                              NURSE GATES

                    What is all this stuff?

                              DELIVERY MAN

                    I just deliver it, Ma'am.

                              NURSE GATES

                    Well, who exactly is it for?

                              DELIVERY MAN

                    A Mrs. Eunice Hallstrom.

                              NURSE GATES

                    I see. Can you wait a moment?

          Nurse Gates locks the medication in a cupboard, and hurries

          down the hallway.

          INT. GROUP THERAPY ROOM - SAME

          Our usual cast of characters.

                               DR. EMLEE

                    But how does that make you feel,

                    John, what Letty said about your

                    hostility?

                              JOHN

                    She doesn't know what the hell

                    she's talking about.

          Nurse Gates barrels in.   The group looks up.

                              NURSE GATES

                    I'm sorry, Doctor. I just need a

                    moment with Mrs. Hallstrom.

                              DR. EMLEE

                    What seems to be the problem?

                              NURSE GATES

                    They say she ordered...Mrs.

                    Hallstrom, did you order a bunch of

                    stuff, because Federal Express...

          M

           rs. Hallstrom's face glows.

                                                                    70.

                               MRS. HALLSTROM

                    It's here, everyone. Come along.

                    It's here.

          She runs out. Nurse Gates follows her. A moment passes.    The

          patients look expectantly at Dr. Emlee.

                              DR. EMLEE

                    Oh, fine, let's see.

          They storm the door.

          INT. NURSES' STATION - SAME

          By the time the patients round the corner, the Federal

          Express man is leaving, and Mrs. Hallstrom has ripped open

          one of the boxes. She clutches a handful of jewelry.

                              MRS. HALLSTROM

                    For you, John. And, Letty. And,

                    Michael, I know you'll love these.

          She hands Michael a pair of faux sapphire earrings. He clips

          them on. Letty and several others carry necklaces. Thomas

          sports a rhinestone tiara. The patients compare jewelry.

                              DR. EMLEE

                    Mrs. Hallstrom, you ordered all

                    this?

                              JOHN

                        (to Mrs. Hallstrom)

                    Thomas got a crown and all I got

                    was a lousy bracelet?

                              DR. EMLEE

                    You must have spent thousands of

                    dollars.

                              MRS. HALLSTROM

                    Don't worry, Doctor, I didn't

                    forget you.

          Mrs. Hallstrom hands Dr. Emlee a fake ruby hair comb.

                              DR. EMLEE

                    Mrs. Hallstrom, you can't possibly

                    afford to pay for this. It must go

                    back.

          Chatter in the hallway stops.

                                                                   71.

                               MRS. HALLSTROM

                    Why, no, Doctor. It can't. Most

                    of it's for my daughter, Lily.

                    She's coming to family day

                    tomorrow...all the way from

                    Cleveland with my grandson.

                    You can't be taking away their

                    "Welcome to California" presents.

                              DR. EMLEE

                    It's going back. We'll contact the

                    company this afternoon.

                        (to patients)

                    Take the jewelry off, please.

                               M

          The patients reluctantly remove their gifts.

                               RS. HALLSTROM

                    But I have to keep something for my

                    daughter.

                              DR. EMLEE

                    Let's go back to group, and discuss

                    it there. Back to group, everyone.

          The patients head back to group.   Dr. Emlee turns to Nurse

          Gates.

                              DR. EMLEE

                        (to Nurse Gates)

                    Increase her lithium to 600

                    milligrams, three times a day. Oh,

                    and Nurse, let's see about

                    canceling the cable.

          EXT. PATIO - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY

          The place buzzes with festivity. A "WELCOME FAMILIES" sign

          hangs from a patio beam. A table is laden with cookies and

          lemonade and platter after platter of carrot curls.

          Letty takes a cookie and looks toward the lawn where Michael

          plays frisbee with his family, even his grandmother, ROSA.

          Nurse Gates walks up to Letty.

                              NURSE GATES

                    Your mother's in the rec room,

                    Letty.

                                                                  72.

          INT. REC ROOM - SAME

          Letty passes Mrs. Hallstrom, who sits by herself, holding one

          small gift on her lap.

          Letty spots her Mom across the room, and walks up to her.

          Her mother has covered a table with swatches of fabric.

                              MRS. MAYER

                    It's so good to see you,

                    Sweetheart.

                              LETTY

                    You too, Mom.

                              MRS. MAYER

                    You're looking good.    A little

                    thin, but good.

          Letty examines a fabric sample.

                              MRS. MAYER

                    Thanks so much for doing this.

                    Ruthie and Jake are up to a million

                    things. And I just can't decide.

          Letty rearranges the fabric samples on the table by color.

                              LETTY

                    Which flowers did you order?

                              MRS. MAYER

                    We haven't. I wanted to talk that

                    over with you, too.

                              LETTY

                    Oh, OK, well, better to choose the

                    table cloths first anyway.

                              MRS. MAYER

                    I

                      was thinking either the peach

                    moire or cream damask.

          Letty holds up a swatch of bright yellow.

                              LETTY

                    This would complement the blue in

                    the bride's maids' dresses. Look.

                              MRS. MAYER

                    Where's your ring, Sweetheart?

                                                                    73.

                              LETTY

                    We aren't allowed to wear jewelry

                    in here, Mom.

                               MRS. MAYER

                    Just think, pretty soon, we'll be

                    doing all these wedding

                    preparations for you.

                        (beat)

                    Of course, if that's what you still

                    want. Ruthie told me some silly

                    story about a crush on some boy

                    here.

          Letty pulls out a cigarette, lights it and starts smoking.

                              LETTY

                    I haven't had a crush since I was

                    12.

                              MRS. MAYER

                    When did you start smoking?

                              LETTY

                    I'll put it out if it bothers you.

                              MRS. MAYER

                    The puckering, dear. It doesn't

                    seem so now, but in time, it will

                    cause wrinkles around the mouth.

          Letty grinds the cigarette beneath her heel.    She bends over

          the fabrics.

                              MRS. MAYER

                    You know, your life isn't about

                    being in a mental hospital.

                              LETTY

                    What?

                              MRS. MAYER

                    I hear this Michael fellow is

                    schizophrenic.

                              LETTY

                    Mom, please.

                              MRS. MAYER

                    Don't forget that Paul's a

                    promising young attorney who loves

                    you very much...

                                                                  74.

                              LETTY

                    Mom, look, if I want to dump Paul,

                    I'll dump him. If I want to screw

                    Michael or live with him or marry

                    him, then I'll do that.

          Thomas, who sits across the room, looks up from his book.

                              MRS. MAYER

                        (whispering)

                    I'm only looking out for you.

                              LETTY

                        (yelling)

                    And if I want to smoke, I'll

                    fucking smoke.

          Letty races out the door and into the garden. In the

          distance, Michael spots her and jogs over. Letty's mother

          watches them. Thomas approaches Mrs. Mayer.

                              THOMAS

                    Mrs. Mayer, I'm sorry but I

                    couldn't help overhearing. I just

                    wanted to say, not that it's any of

                    my business...

                              MRS. MAYER

                    Yes?

                              THOMAS

                    I think, really, I think I'd go

                    with the cream damask.

          I

           NT. REC ROOM - LATER

          Letty and Michael walk through the rec room toward the dining

          hall. Nurse Gates bends down in front of Mrs. Hallstrom, who

          sits where we last saw her.

                              NURSE GATES

                    It's OK to be upset.

                              MRS. HALLSTROM

                        (gaily)

                    Upset? Why of course not. My

                    goodness, no. I'm sure she just

                    got hung up.

          Letty and Michael stop.

                                                                  75.

                              MICHAEL

                    Mrs. Hallstrom, why don't you join

                    my family for dinner. You'll love

                    my Grandma Rosa.

                              MRS. HALLSTROM

                    That's so sweet, Michael. But,

                    really, I've so many things to do.

                              LETTY

                    If you change your mind, we'll be

                    in the dining hall.

          Michael and Letty walk on, exchanging a sad look.

          INT. DINING HALL - LATER

          Mr. Santucci and Mrs. Santucci sit at the heads of the table.

          Letty sits between Rosa and Michael.

                              ROSA

                        (to Letty)

                    What do you need now?

                        (to Mr. Santucci)

                    Send down the lamb. This girl's as

                    thin as a stick.

                               LETTY

                    Oh, no.   I'm stuffed.

                              ROSA

                    Tell her to eat, Frank.

                               MR. SANTUCCI

                    Mangia.   Mangia.

                              MICHAEL

                        (whispering to Letty)

                    You can't turn down Grandma Rosa's

                    lamb.

                              ROSA

                    Or my eggplant. I make the best

                    eggplant in L.A. The mozzarella I

                    use, it's so fresh it sweats.

          Letty heaps more food on her plate.

                              MRS. SANTUCCI

                    Michael says you're a teacher.

                                                                      76.

                              LETTY

                    I was. I'm hoping I'll still have

                    a job when I get out.

          Mrs. Hallstrom walks into the room, wearing her Christmas

          stocking cap. She starts to dispense erasers.

                              LETTY

                    What's she doing?

          Mrs. Hallstrom, practically skipping, zeros in on Grandma

          Rosa. She hands Rosa the gift meant for her daughter.

                              MRS. HALLSTROM

                    Rosa, Rosa, you must have this,

                    Rosa.

                              ROSA

                    Grazie.

                              MICHAEL

                    Mrs. Hallstrom, join us. Please.

          But, by this point, Mrs. Hallstrom's already bounded away,

          divesting herself of more and more erasers to bewildered

          parents and delighted children.

          She clambers onto a table in the middle of the room. Marie

          gets up from another table and leaves the room to get help.

                              MRS. HALLSTROM

                    Merry Christmas to all. Ho, ho,

                    ho, ho.

                              LETTY

                    Michael, we've got to stop her.

          Michael pushes back his chair.   He's trapped between the

          table and the wall.

                              MRS. HALLSTROM

                    My goodness, it's so very warm in

                    here. So warm.

          She takes off her cap and tosses it to a surprised looking

          man. But she doesn't stop there. With haphazard abandon, she

          begins to disrobe, first her blouse, then her skirt.

                              MRS. HALLSTROM

                    Way, way, way too warm for

                    December. Now, let's sing Jingle

                    Bells, Jingle Bells, Jingle all the

                    way...

                                                                  77.

          The group looks on in horror, mesmerized by her behavior.

          Then, almost as one, the patients spring into action.

          Michael bolts over his dining table and runs to Mrs.

          Hallstrom. He jumps onto her table, trying to restrain the

          dancing woman so he can wrap his sweater around her.

          By this time, John, Thomas and Letty have surrounded her in a

          protective enclave. Michael sets Mrs. Hallstrom on the

          ground. She looks up at the group, and continues belting out

          I

          "Jingle Bells."

           NT. LINEN CLOSET - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - NIGHT

          Letty and Michael lie on the floor next to each other,

          trading puffs on a cigarette. The glowing ember is the only

          light in the room.

                              MICHAEL

                    You must have thought about it.

                    Everyone does.

                               LETTY

                    I just want to see Beast.

                        (beat)

                    Where would you go?

                              MICHAEL

                    The mission up in Santa Barbara.

                              LETTY

                    No way.

                              MICHAEL

                    That's where I always go when I get

                    out.

                              LETTY

                    Why?

                              MICHAEL

                    My dad used to take me there when I

                    was little. It's totally quiet.

                    And you can see the ocean for

                    miles.

          They smoke for a while.

                              LETTY

                    What else would you do?

                                                          78.

                              MICHAEL

                    I'd like to drink a bottle of red

                    wine with you and then make love to

                    you and spend the whole night

                    together. And we'd get up in the

                    morning and spend hours lounging

                    around and reading the paper.

                              LETTY

                    And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed

                    from the can.

                              MICHAEL

                    How can you even mention Spaghetti-

                    O's after eating Grandma Rosa's

                    dinner tonight?

                              LETTY

                    I have a terrible confession.

                              MICHAEL

                    Tell the doctor.

                              LETTY

                    I don't like lamb.

          Michael sits up.

                              MICHAEL

                    Then it's over.

                                LETTY

                    Lie down.

          Michael lies down.

                              MICHAEL

                    It's a good thing my family loves

                    you.

                              LETTY

                    Your family just met me.

                              MICHAEL

                    You're right. I guess I was

                    projecting. What I should have

                    said is, "It's a good thing I love

                    you."

                                LETTY

                    Do you?

                                                                       79.

                                 MICHAEL

                    I do.

                              LETTY

                    Michael, I...

                              MICHAEL

                    It's OK. You don't have to say

                    anything.

                                 LETTY

                    But I do.     I love you, too.

          Michael and Letty lie still, looking into each others eyes.

          INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY

          P

           osters of Harry Houdini and Doug Henning.       Handcuffs and

          card decks all over.

                              MICHAEL

                    Your Honor, I feel I should be

                    released. I'm sufficiently able to

                    look after...

          Michael stops. His eyes glaze over.        His head darts toward

          the corner of the room.

                              MICHAEL

                        (to the corner)

                    What? What?

          Nothing's there.   Nothing at all.    But Michael keeps staring.

          A KNOCK on the door. Michael's eyes refocus.       He opens the

          door to find Letty.

                              LETTY

                    John and Nurse Gates are waiting

                    for you.

                                 MICHAEL

                    Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I

                    look?

                               LETTY

                        (straightening his tie)

                    Great. I came to tell you to break

                    a leg, and to give you this for

                    good luck.

          Letty hands him the Cracker Jack ring.

                                                                     80.

          INT. COMMITMENT COURT - DAY

          Michael sits near the front of the courtroom with half a

          dozen other patients from various institutions.

          Nurse Gates sits a few rows back near JOHN'S MOTHER and

          Michael's family--Mr. and Mrs. Santucci and Grandma Rosa.

          JUDGE MILTON, 60s, questions John, who's on the stand.

                              JUDGE MILTON

                    Why have you petitioned to leave

                    the institution?

                              JOHN

                    I haven't had an episode in more

                    than a month, Sir.

                              JUDGE MILTON

                    How do you plan to support

                    yourself?

                              JOHN

                    My family's helping me out, Your

                    Honor.

                              JUDGE MILTON

                    Where will you live upon release?

                                JOHN

                    Live?

          John's mother nods encouragingly at him.

                              JUDGE MILTON

                    Where do you plan to reside, Mr.

                    Lockyer?

                              JOHN

                    With my mother.

                              JUDGE MILTON

                    Is your mother here today?

          John points to her.   John's mother waves at the judge.

                              JOHN

                    That's the bitch. That cock-

                    sucking bitch. She put me here.

                    She did. She's the Satan that did

                    this all.

                                                                  81.

          As bailiffs remove John from the stand, Michael offers a wan

          smile to his family.

          INT. COMMITMENT COURT - LATER

          Michael, outwardly poised and collected, sits on the stand.

          His hands are clenched in tight fists.

                              JUDGE MILTON

                    The records indicate no major

                    episodes in the past four months.

                    And it seems you have the support

                    of the staff.

                                MICHAEL

                    Yes, Sir.

                              JUDGE MILTON

                    But I see you've been in and out of

                    the hospital more than ten times.

                              MICHAEL

                    Eleven, Your Honor.   But I'm on a

                    new medication now.

                              JUDGE MILTON

                    Do you feel ready to re-enter the

                    world?

                              MICHAEL

                    Yes, Sir. My family is    prepared to

                    support me until I find   a job.

                    They've already located   an

                    apartment for me that's   very near

                    them.

                              JUDGE MILTON

                    Very well, then. By order of the

                    court, you are released. I wish

                    you good luck.

          Michael's shoulders relax. He opens his fist. Inside is the

          Cracker Jack ring, and the magenta circle it has imprinted on

          his palm.

          EXT. COMMITMENT COURT - LATER

          Michael walks to the car with his mother, father and

          grandmother, who keeps tousling his hair with pride.

                                                                     82.

          INT. VISITING ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY

          Letty stands awkwardly in front of Paul, who sits in a

          wingback chair.

                              PAUL

                    What's so urgent?   You've got me

                    worried.

                              LETTY

                    I need to tell you something, and

                    I'm not sure how.

          Paul stands.

                               PAUL

                    You can tell me anything.

                        (beat)

                    Do you want to postpone the

                    wedding? Is it too much pressure?

                                LETTY

                    No...

                              PAUL

                    That's a load off my mind.

                              LETTY

                    Paul, I want to break off the

                    engagement.

                              P

                                 AUL

                    You what?

                              LETTY

                    I don't mean to hurt you.    I know

                    this is a terrible thing.    And I

                    have really loved you.

                              PAUL

                    Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me?

                    Letty, it's natural to be nervous.

                    But we're going to work through our

                    problems.

                              LETTY

                    I've met someone else.

                                PAUL

                    Who?

                              LETTY

                    It doesn't matter who.

                                                                  83.

                              PAUL

                    Have you been seeing another

                    teacher?

                              LETTY

                    No.

                              PAUL

                    It's a doctor, isn't it? That's

                    unethical. I'll have him rung up

                    on malpractice charges so fast his

                    head will spin.

                              LETTY

                    He's a patient here.

          Paul considers this a moment.

                              PAUL

                    Of all the crazy things. I

                    understood when you dropped out of

                    law school. And during this whole

                    mess, I've tried to be supportive.

                    But, really, Letty, what can you be

                    thinking?

                              LETTY

                    I love him.

                              PAUL

                    You're going to throw away our life

                    together for some shared experience

                    with a looney-tune that you

                    misguidedly think is love?

                              LETTY

                    Here's the ring.

                              PAUL

                    No way. You keep the ring.     You'll

                    come to your senses.

                              LETTY

                    I've made my decision, Paul.

                              PAUL

                    You keep it, Letty. This is not

                    over. Our life is not over.

          EXT. FRONT STEPS - SAME

          Paul walks out the door and down the steps past Michael, who

          runs up them two at a time.

                                                                   84.

                              MICHAEL

                    How's it hanging, Paul?

          Paul turns to watch Michael as Michael swings open the door

          and sails into the institute.

          INT. VISITING ROOM - SAME

          Letty waits as a NURSE opens the door to the ward.   Letty is

          about to step through, when Michael enters.

                              MICHAEL

                    Visitor for Ms. Mayer.

          Letty whirls around.

                                 LETTY

                    Well?        M

                                  ICHAEL

                    Home free.

          Letty and Michael hug.

                              NURSE

                    Letty, Michael, you have about five

                    minutes until visiting hours end.

          The nurse retreats.

                              LETTY

                    Tell me all.

                              MICHAEL

                    I was brilliant, or at least

                    boringly sane.

                              LETTY

                    So there were no problems?

                                 MICHAEL

                    Not a one.

                              LETTY

                    And did you go to the mission?

                              MICHAEL

                    No, you goof, I came to see you.

                              LETTY

                    Just checking.

                                                                   85.

                              MICHAEL

                    I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the

                    dirty deed?

                                 LETTY

                    Yeah.

                              MICHAEL

                    So, it's over?

                               LETTY

                    All over.

                        (beat)

                    Did you see your new apartment?

                              MICHAEL

                    One bedroom, second floor, no view.

                                 LETTY

                    Furnished?

                              MICHAEL

                    No, I need some serious household

                    advice.

                              LETTY

                    First off, you'll need to go to

                    Target. And, let's see, what

                    should you buy?

                              MICHAEL

                    I better make a list.

                              LETTY

                    List schmist. You'll remember.

          INT. HALLWAY - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - NIGHT

          Letty sits in the corridor opposite Marie and Thomas.   They

          are playing BLACKJACK. Letty deals.

                                 THOMAS

                    Hit me.

          Letty hands one over.    Thomas flips over his cards.

                                 THOMAS

                    I'm over.

          Letty looks to Marie, who waves her off. Marie is fine with

          her cards. They look down the hall. Nurse Gates walks beside

          JAMIE, a man in his late 20s, who wears the same dazed

          expression Letty did the morning after she was admitted.

                                                                     86.

                              NURSE GATES

                        (to Jamie)

                    Dr. Stone will ask you some

                    questions, and then we'll get you

                    settled.

          Nurse Gates and Jamie come upon the gang.

                              NURSE GATES

                        (to Letty/Bill)

                    Lights out in 15, Guys.

          Nurse Gates continues down the hall, hand firmly planted

                               M

          under Jamie's elbow as he weaves unsteadily beside her.

                               ARIE

                    Wow, that first night is hard.

                              LETTY

                    It's going to be a difficult few

                    weeks for him.

                              THOMAS

                    It really makes you think.

                              LETTY

                    It really does.

          They look down the hall at the retreating figures.   They look

          at each other.

                              MARIE

                    I'll put in 5 that it's a straight

                    diagnosis of depressive

                    personality.

                              LETTY

                    Are you kidding? With those glazed

                    eyes? I'm willing to bet 10 there

                    was some break with reality going

                    on there. Psychosis. Without a

                    doubt, psychosis.

          INT. DR. EMLEE'S OFFICE - DAY

          Letty is curled up in a chair opposite Dr. Emlee.

                              LETTY

                    But what I really can't believe is

                    that I'm starting to actually miss

                    work.

                                                                  87.

                              DR. EMLEE

                    Have you been in contact with the

                    principal about your job?

                              LETTY

                    I thought about calling, but I want

                    to wait until I know when I'll be

                    out.

                              DR. EMLEE

                    Then, you should call.

                              LETTY

                    What?

                              DR. EMLEE

                    I think it's about that time,

                    Letty. The charges against you

                    have been dropped, the drugs have

                    evened out and you seem to be

                    dealing with your life quite well.

                              LETTY

                    Are you saying I'm through with

                    therapy?

                               DR. EMLEE

                    Let's not be hasty.

                        (beat)

                    I'm saying we should plan a release

                    date for early next week.

          Off Letty's excited face, we

                                                   CUT TO:

          EXT. TARGET - DAY

          Crowds, crowds and more crowds. Michael pulls unsuccessfully

          at a shopping cart that is stuck to another.

          A MATRONLY WOMAN walks up, nudges Michael out of the way and

          yanks the cart out of its row. She rolls it toward Michael,

          grabs one for herself and is on her way into the store.

          M

           ichael takes several deep breaths. With trepidation in his

          step, he heads into the great unknown of the crowded store...

          EXT. TARGET - 30 MINUTES LATER

                                                                   88.

          Michael emerges from the store, quite pleased with himself

          that he made it out alive. He commands a cart heaped full of

          useless gadgets and trinkets, a half dozen picture frames and

          about 20 decorative pillows.

          EXT. GROUNDS - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY

          Letty and her mother walk briskly through the gardens.

                              MRS. MAYER

                    Must you walk so quickly?

                              LETTY

                    It's good exercise, Mom.

                              MRS. MAYER

                    I've got 26 years on you. If we

                    could just slow down, we could talk

                    so much easier.

          Letty slackens her pace.

                              MRS. MAYER

                    I'm so thankful you'll be leaving

                    next week. If you want me to pick

                    you up, I will.

                              LETTY

                    I've already made arrangements.

                              MRS. MAYER

                    Ruthie mentioned that Michael might

                    be coming for you.

          Letty stops and wags her finger at her mother.

                              LETTY

                    Mom, we agreed. You can visit, but

                    you're not allowed to mention

                    Michael.

                              MRS. MAYER

                    Not even if it's something

                    positive?

                               LETTY

                    Nyet.   That's the condition.

          Mother and daughter keep walking in silence.

                              MRS. MAYER

                    Have you spoken to Paul at all?

                                                                     89.

                               LETTY

                     One more and you're out.

                               MRS. MAYER

                     Honestly, Letty.

                               LETTY

                     A deal's a deal.

          The two walk on in silence.

          Silence.

          More silence.

                               MRS. MAYER

                     Have you heard the figure on how

                     much Queen Elizabeth's going to pay

                     in taxes this year?

          Letty stops walking. She turns a sunny smile on her mother,

          then hugs her.      L

                               LETTY

                     I knew you had it in you.

          INT. LETTY'S ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY

          Letty neatly folds garments and lays them in a suitcase.    Dr.

          Emlee looks on.

                               DR. EMLEE

                     So, we'll meet every Tuesday and

                     Friday. And if you have any kind

                     of emergency, you can page me.

                               LETTY

                     OK, good. That's good. Thanks an

                     awful lot for everything, and for

                     coming down here to see me off.

                               DR. EMLEE

                     It was just a little going-away

                     gesture.

                               LETTY

                     I have a going-away gesture for

                     you, too.

                               DR. EMLEE

                     Oh?

                                                                    90.

          Letty puts her hand in her suitcase and rummages through the

          clothes, creating a jumbled mess. She snaps the luggage

          closed. Bits of clothing hang out. They LAUGH.

          INT. NURSES' STATION - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY

          Letty sets her duffel bag down next to two suitcases. She

          hugs Marie, John, Thomas, then walks over to Mrs. Hallstrom,

          who hangs back from the group. Letty embraces her.

                              LETTY

                    I'll miss you, Mrs. Hallstrom.

          There's no response.    Letty goes to Nurse Gates and hugs her.

                              NURSE GATES

                    Take care, Letty. And, let me know

                    if you need help with any spiders.

                              LETTY

                    You know I will.       Thanks for

                    everything.

          Letty walks toward Michael, who gathers up her bags.

                              MICHAEL

                    See you later, guys.

          Michael and Letty walk through the VISITING ROOM...

                              MICHAEL

                    Aren't you supposed to throw a

                    bouquet or something?

                              LETTY

                    Aren't you ever quiet?

          They walk out the doors onto the FRONT STEPS OF THE HOSPITAL.

          Michael grabs Letty's hand as they hurry down the steps.

                                 MICHAEL

                    Where to?

                              LETTY

                    I've heard the mission in Santa

                    Barbara is the place to go.

          EXT. SANTA BARBARA MISSION - MAGIC HOUR

          In the background, the Spanish-style mission blends into the

          hillside. Letty and Michael sit on a bluff, holding hands.

          They look out at the ocean, where the sun heads toward the

          waves in a fiery red glow.

                                                                    91.

          INT. HALLWAY - MICHAEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

          Michael and Letty walk down the hall. Michael stops at a door

          and showcases it. He jingles the keys.

                              MICHAEL

                    This is it -- 3B.     Check it out.

                                LETTY

                    Open up.    I want to see.

                              MICHAEL

                    Close your eyes.

          Letty claps her hands over her eyes.    Michael opens the door

          and guides her into his castle.

          INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - SAME

                                MICHAEL

                    OK.    Open them.

          Letty surveys the territory. Forget tables, chairs and

          couches. Throw pillows are strewn everywhere.

                                LETTY

                    Wow.

                              MICHAEL

                    You like it?

          Letty picks up a pillow and runs her hand over the fabric.

          She pauses a moment before speaking.

                              LETTY

                    I love the pillows.

                              MICHAEL

                    Throw pillows, Letty. The sales

                    lady said they're the latest thing.

                              LETTY

                    Very trendy. Let's see the rest.

          Michael leads Letty to the bedroom.

          INT. BEDROOM - SAME

          A futon bed, draped with a mosquito net, rests in the corner.

          Two TVs take center stage.

                              LETTY

                    It's TV heaven.

                                                                  92.

                              MICHAEL

                    I was tired of watching what

                    everyone else wants to watch. Now

                    we can watch two shows at once.

                              LETTY

                    Let's try out the bed.

          Michael grabs her hand and pulls her toward the door.

                              MICHAEL

                    You've got to see the kitchen

                    first.

          INT. KITCHEN - SAME

                              MICHAEL

                    Do you like it?

                              LETTY

                    I love your apartment.

                                MICHAEL

                    Really?

                              LETTY

                    You'll never get rid of me.

          Michael kisses Letty on the lips.

                              LETTY

                    What do you say we go out to dinner

                    to celebrate?

                              MICHAEL

                    Out? Are you kidding?     I've got

                    all the fixings here.

          Off Letty's look of surprise, we watch Michael open a

          cupboard door. The shelves are filled from top to bottom

          with cans of Spaghetti-O's.

          Letty squeezes Michael in a bear hug.

          INT. BEDROOM - MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Letty, in a T-shirt, and Michael, in boxers, lounge on the

          futon. They watch both TVs -- one tuned-in to Jay Leno, the

          other to David Letterman.

          Michael eats from a can of Spaghetti-O's. Letty reaches over

          with her fork and snags a mouthful from Michael's can.

                                                                       93.

                              LETTY

                    How can you not like the Top 10

                    List?

                                 MICHAEL

                    I like it.     But Headlines are

                    better.

                              LETTY

                    You're so wrong.

          Letty takes her remote and increases the volume on her TV.

          As Letterman gets louder, Michael zaps his volume.

          It's a war. Letterman then Leno get LOUDER and LOUDER and

          LOUDER until Letty makes a might lunge. She wrests Michael's

          remote from him. Letty MUTES both TVs.

                                 MICHAEL

                    Hey.

                              LETTY

                    It's sex time.

          Michael mockingly checks his watch.    Letty climbs on top of

          him. Michael rolls on top of her.

                              MICHAEL

                    I think it's my turn.

          CLOSE on their faces as Michael gently licks the side of

          Letty's mouth.

                              LETTY

                    Did I get spaghetti sauce on my

                    face?

                                 MICHAEL

                    No.

          Michael licks Letty's nose.

                                 LETTY

                    Michael.

                                 MICHAEL

                    Shhhh.

          Michael and Letty look into each other's eyes, bathed in the

          blue light thrown off by the twin televisions.

          Michael places a pillow gently beneath Letty's head.    He

          caresses her face.

                                                                     94.

          Letty's eyes are alive to every look, every touch. Michael

          kisses her slowly on the forehead, the nose, and the lips.

          CLOSE on Letty's hands as she reaches up to stroke Michael's

          forehead and caress his temple.

          CLOSER on her hands as Letty runs them through Michael's

          hair, then twists a curly lock around her finger.

          SOFT MOANS as we

                                                         DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. BEDROOM - MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - DAY

          CLOSE on Letty's hand, resting on the comforter on Michael's

          bed. The alarm clock RINGS. Letty's hand slaps it into

          submission.

          INT. BEDROOM - MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - LATER

          Letty's still in bed, a look of bliss across her face.

                               MICHAEL

                    Letty?   Rise and shine.

                                                         LETTY'S POV:

          Michael's face fills her vision.

                                                       BACK TO SCENE:

          Letty's eyes close.

                                 LETTY

                    Not yet.

                              MICHAEL

                    I'll be forced to tickle you.

          Letty opens one eye and glares at him.

                               L

                                 LETTY

                    Go away.

                              MICHAEL

                    How about this? It's 10:30.

          Letty bolts upright.

                              LETTY

                    I'm supposed to meet the principal

                    in half an hour.

                                                                     95.

                              MICHAEL

                    I'll see you tonight.

          Michael gives her a kiss and walks into the LIVING ROOM.

          Michael adjusts his tie. Letty, naked, runs into the room

          and throws her arms around his neck.

                                 LETTY

                    Good luck.

                              MICHAEL

                    You, too. Kick ass today.

          Michael walks out the door. Letty thinks for a minute. She

          flings open the door and yells to Michael's retreating back.

          INT. HALLWAY - SAME

                              LETTY

                    My apartment tonight.   You can meet

                    Beast.

          Michael swings around.

                              MICHAEL

                    Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?

                                 LETTY

                    Yeah?

                              MICHAEL

                        (yelling)

                    You've got one hell of a great

                    body.

          The door across the hall opens. A LITTLE OLD MAN stares at

          Letty's naked figure. She slams Michael's apartment door.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - SAME

          Letty collapses in GIGGLES.

          INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

          Letty sits across from the principal.

                               PRINCIPAL GAIL

                    I didn't have any choice but to

                    include the parents' letters in

                    your file.

                                                          96.

                              LETTY

                    Well, I understand.     I know my

                    behavior was poor.

                              PRINCIPAL GAIL

                    So, in light of how the parents

                    feel, and the fact the students are

                    doing so well with the substitute,

                    I don't think I can put you back in

                    the classroom just yet.

                              LETTY

                    Look, Gail, I've been a good

                    teacher.

                               PRINCIPAL GAIL

                    I know, Letty. But the incident

                    with Zach was frightening for the

                    children.

                        (beat)

                    Now if you'd come to me, explained

                    what was going on...

                              LETTY

                    Believe me, I wish I'd understood

                    what was going on. I've worked

                    really hard to get better.

                              P

                               RINCIPAL GAIL

                    I'm glad you're doing well.

                              LETTY

                    I've already thought about how to

                    tell the kids where I was.

          Letty hands the principal a letter.

                               LETTY

                    And I'd like to send the parents

                    this letter of explanation. With

                    your support, I think they can

                    accept me.

          The principal reads the letter.

                              PRINCIPAL GAIL

                    It's a very nice letter. But I

                    have to go with what's best for the

                    students.

                              LETTY

                    What does that mean?

                                                                  97.

                              PRINCIPAL GAIL

                    I need someone to work on budget

                    projections.

                              LETTY

                    Office work?

                              PRINCIPAL GAIL

                    Or, of course, you could take a

                    sabbatical the rest of the year.

          INT. BANK - DAY

          Michael sits at a back desk with MR. SMYTHE, who wears a

          three-piece pin-striped suit and taps a pencil on his knee.

                              MR. SMYTHE

                    It's not that we're doubting your

                    intelligence, Mr. Santucci. But

                    your work history shows so many

                    interruptions.

                              MICHAEL

                    I know, but as I said...

                               MR. SMYTHE

                    I appreciate your candor about your

                    illness, but my bosses are

                    concerned.

                              MICHAEL

                    I can do the job.

                              MR. SMYTHE

                    Between you and me, my uncle, he

                    has some mental problems, and I

                    know what you're going through. If

                    it were up to me, I'd hire you.

          Michael's already standing.

                               MICHAEL

                    Right.   Thanks for your help.

          He shakes Mr. Smythe's hand, and, downcast, gets out of the

          bank as quickly as he can.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - LETTY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Letty sits on the floor. She gulps down some aspirin, then

          hauls Beast into her lap. The doorbell RINGS.

                                                                  98.

                                 LETTY

                    It's open.

          Michael walks in, and looks around.

                              MICHAEL

                    Gosh, Letty, this is a great place.

                                 LETTY

                    Thanks.

          He kisses her, and lies down on the floor to stroke the cat.

                               M

                               ICHAEL

                    This must be Beast.

                              LETTY

                    That's Mr. Beast to you.

                              MICHAEL

                    How was your day?

                              LETTY

                    I bombed. It's either work in the

                    office or nothing.

                              MICHAEL

                    Sounds grim.

                                LETTY

                    Yeah.    How was the job search?

          Michael makes a thumbs-down gesture.

                              LETTY

                    Who ever said sanity was fun?

                              MICHAEL

                    It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.

                                 LETTY

                    Promise?

                               MICHAEL

                    Promise.

                        (beat)

                    As long as we have steak.

                                 LETTY

                    Steak?

                                                                     99.

                               MICHAEL

                    It's a well-known fact that a red-

                    meat dinner can cure the blues.

                        (beat)

                    You and Beast wait here. I'll be

                    back in a jiff.

          Letty gives Michael a tired smile. Michael jumps up and

          leaves. A moment passes. The door opens again.

                              MICHAEL

                    While I'm gone why don't you slip

                    into something a little more naked?

          EXT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT

          Michael walks out of the grocery store, loaded down with

          bags. He carries a bottle of wine and a bunch of flowers.

          He passes two ladies who gossip outside the store.

                              LADY ONE

                    I can't believe he did that.

                              LADY TWO

                    What a weirdo.

          Michael stops abruptly.   He turns back and looks at the

          women. They LAUGH.

          Michael starts toward the car. He hears more LAUGHTER from

          the women. He turns back and walks up to them.

                              MICHAEL

                    Don't ever talk about me again, you

                    hear me?

          The women pull back in fright.

          INT. KITCHEN - LETTY'S APARTMENT - LATER

          Letty, in a skimpy negligee, lights candles on the table.

          Michael enters with the groceries and wine.

                              LETTY

                    I thought maybe you got lost.

                              MICHAEL

                    The store was busy.

                              LETTY

                    You got wine. That's great.

          M

                                                                   100.

                              MICHAEL

                    Would you mind if we just called it

                    an early night?

                              LETTY

                    You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.

                              M

                               ICHAEL

                    I think I should go home.

                              LETTY

                    Are you OK?

                              MICHAEL

                    Big restaurant interview tomorrow.

                              LETTY

                    But what about the red meat-blues

                    thing?

                              MICHAEL

                    You know, we've got that dinner

                    with my parents tomorrow, too. I

                    should really get some rest

                    tonight.

          Michael gives Letty a kiss good night. He leaves. She

          stares after him. Reluctantly, she blows out the candles and

          starts putting the groceries away.

                              LETTY

                        (to Beast)

                    How's filet sound?

          INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

          The coffee shop hasn't opened for business yet. Michael and

          six people in their early 20s fill out applications.

           ichael stares blankly at his application.    He fills out his

          name. He can't get any further.

          TWO OTHER APPLICANTS glance toward him.   Michael tries to

          write. He can't.

                              MICHAEL

                        (under his breath)

                    No, no, no. Not now. No.

          The other applicants look toward Michael and quickly avert

          their eyes. The RESTAURANT MANAGER walks up to the group.

                                                                  101.

          Michael grabs his briefcase and walks out of the restaurant.

          His application, incomplete, remains on the table.

          INT. KITCHEN - SANTUCCI HOUSE - NIGHT

          This kitchen is the heart of the home--copper pots, two pasta

          makers and every size wooden spoon made.

          Letty, lightly dusted with flour, mixes fresh pasta with her

          hands. Mrs. Santucci peers into the bowl.

                              MRS. SANTUCCI

                    More water. It's too pasty.

          Letty pours in more water.

                               LETTY

                    I'll never Mget the hang of this.

                               RS. SANTUCCI

                    All the Santucci women go through

                    this.

          Letty smiles at her and kneads harder.   Mr. Santucci enters

          and kisses his wife.

                              MR. SANTUCCI

                    Hi there, Letty.

                                 LETTY

                    Hi, Frank.

          Mr. Santucci looks in the pasta bowl.

                              MR. SANTUCCI

                    It needs more water.

          He dumps some in.   Letty looks sadly at the gloppy mess.

                              LETTY

                        (to Mrs. Santucci)

                    Maybe we should make lamb next

                    week.

          Michael walks in.

                              MRS. SANTUCCI

                    Hi, Sweetheart.

                              LETTY

                    How'd it go?

                                                                 102.

          Michael takes his tie, holds it up like a noose and lets his

          tongue loll out of his mouth.

                              LETTY

                    What happened?

                              MICHAEL

                    Four interviews. Four no-gos.

                              LETTY

                    The restaurant, too?

                              MICHAEL

                    I couldn't even face that one.

          Mr. and Mrs. Santucci look at each other.

                              LETTY

                    That's OK. We can call and

                    reschedule in the morning.

                              MICHAEL

                    You don't have to take care of me,

                    you know.

          An uneasy silence falls in the room.

                              MRS. SANTUCCI

                    Maybe we should save the job talk

                    for after dinner.

          Michael looks in the bowl of pasta dough that Letty continues

          to labor over. He reaches in to help with the mixing.

                              MICHAEL

                        (to Letty)

                    Just promise you'll love me even if

                    I end up in a job where I have to

                    wear a blue polyester cap.

                              LETTY

                    I think you know I'd love you even

                    more in a blue polyester cap.

          INT. BATHROOM - MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Michael finishes brushing his teeth. He opens the medicine

          cabinet, pulls out a prescription bottle and pours a pill

          into his hand.

                              LETTY (OS)

                    You're going to miss the Top Ten.

                                                                 103.

                              MICHAEL

                    Coming.

          He raises the pill to his mouth, then opens his hand and lets

          it drop in the sink. Michael runs the water and watches the

          pill swirl slowly down the drain.

                              LETTY (OS)

                    Michael, hurry.

          Michael stuffs the pill bottle in a bottom drawer. He opens

          the door, sprints into the bedroom and leaps onto Letty, who

          lies on the futon. Letty SCREAMS and LAUGHS.

          INT. MCDONALD'S RESTAURANT - DAY

          Michael sits in a booth drinking coffee. He bows over an

          application, pen in hand. About a third is filled out.

          INT. SUPERINTENDENT'S OFFICE - DAY

          Letty and Superintendent Johansen sit on the floor, which is

          covered with math games, posters and charts.

                              LETTY

                    I think I could get the program up

                    and running in the next two weeks.

                              JOHANSEN

                    From what I understand the

                    principal has removed you from

                    student activities.

                              LETTY

                    She's worried that I'm unstable.

          Johansen studies her.

                              LETTY

                    But I wouldn't push for the program

                    if I wasn't ready.

                              JOHANSEN

                    What about the office work?

                              LETTY

                    I'd have to do that, too. But I've

                    gotten better at pacing myself.

                              JOHANSEN

                    Are you sure?

                                                                  104.

                              LETTY

                    I'll call you if I have problems.

                    Scout's honor.

                              JOHANSEN

                    I have to say I'm inclined to give

                    it another try.

          Letty hugs Johansen.

                               JOHANSEN

                    But, Letty, why don't you give

                    yourself three weeks to set it up

                    this time?

          INT. MCDONALD'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Michael sits in the same booth, eating a hamburger.   About

          half of the application is now completed.

          INT. TUXEDO SHOP - NIGHT

          Letty and her mother sit in silence. Letty smiles at her

          mother. Her mother gives her a very tiny smile back.

          Michael hurries in.

                              MICHAEL

                    Hey, Letty. Mrs. Mayer.

                              LETTY

                    I got worried. Are you OK?

          Michael pulls a blue polyester hat out of his pocket and puts

          it on.               M

                               ICHAEL

                    How may I help you?

                              LETTY

                    Congratulations.

                              MRS. MAYER

                    Michael, the shop's about to close.

                    Maybe you could try on your tux.

          Michael heads to the dressing room in the back of the store.

                              LETTY

                        (to Mrs. Mayer)

                    Michael just got a job.    Couldn't

                    you congratulate him?

                                                                   105.

                               MRS. MAYER

                    I will, Dear. I promise.

                        (beat)

                    Why McDonald's?

                              LETTY

                    He's been looking everywhere for

                    weeks, Mom.   It's not that easy

                    after you've been locked away.

          Letty looks toward the back of the store.    Her mother looks

          at her. Letty ignores her mother.

                              MRS. MAYER

                    I've read that lots of people my

                    age are supplementing their incomes

                    these days by working at McDonald's

                    and Burger King.

          Letty looks at her mother, tries to read her.

                              LETTY

                    I'm going to take that as an honest

                    effort at being open minded.

                              MRS. MAYER

                    Don't be fresh.

                              LETTY

                    Just remember that I love him.

          Michael walks out of the dressing room and advances toward

          the two women, bowing in Cary Grant fashion as he nears.

          Letty's mother turns to her daughter, who beams brightly at

          the dashing Michael.

                              MRS. MAYER

                        (to Letty)

                    I'll say this, Dear.   He looks damn

                    good in a tuxedo.

          EXT. TRACK - DAY

          Letty and Michael jog.

                              MICHAEL

                    Aunt Lily is the one who married

                    your father's cousin?

                              LETTY

                    No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is

                    the one who looks like a hooker.

                                                                    106.

                              MICHAEL

                    Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who

                    likes magic?

                              LETTY

                    You don't have to know all this by

                    Saturday. It took me years.

          INT. CHURCH - DAY

          Every inch of every pew in the Baroque church is stuffed with

          guests. Michael sits in the second row. He cranes his head

          around as "Pachelbel's Canon" RINGS OUT and the FLOWER GIRL

          L

          advances.

          Letty, in the first part of the bride's maids' procession,

          heads down the aisle next. The bride is nowhere in sight.

          But even so, as soon as Michael spots Letty, he stands.

          Everyone else remains seated. They look at him. Michael

          doesn't notice. He has eyes only for Letty.

          Letty's mother looks at Michael with more than annoyance.

          Begrudgingly, she also stands.

          Following the lead, the entire church stands for Letty.    She

          smiles at Michael.

          INT. BALLROOM - COUNTRY CLUB - LATER

          A parade of guests pass through the receiving line to greet

          Mr. Mayer, Monica, Letty, Mrs. Mayer, Ruth and Jake.

          Michael hovers close to Letty. AUNT LILY, with fluorescent

          red hair and a silver lame miniskirt, spots him.

                              AUNT LILY

                        (to Michael)

                    What a beautiful wedding.

          As she passes out of earshot,

                               MICHAEL

                        (to Letty)

                    Aunt Lily?

                              LETTY

                    Bingo.

          Mrs. Mayer talks to her brother CORT.

                                                                 107.

                               MRS. MAYER

                     Oh, and have you met Michael?    He's

                     Letty's boyfriend.

          Letty and Ruth overhear this. They make eye contact.   Ruth

          raises her eyebrows toward Letty. Letty smiles back.

          INT.   BALLROOM - LATER

          Ruth and Letty talk while Michael twirls across the dance

          floor with Monica.

                               RUTH

                     The worst was when I stammered

                     Jake's name.

                               LETTY

                     I don't think people even noticed.

                     I thought the ceremony was perfect.

                               RUTH

                     That's thanks to all your help.

          Cort, overweight and red from drink, approaches Ruth and

          Letty.

                               LETTY

                     Uh oh, Uncle Cort at 6 o'clock.

                                RUTH

                     Sorry to do this to you. But I am

                     the bride.

          Ruth turns and flees. CORT pounces on Letty and plants the

          wettest kiss ever on her mouth.

                               CORT

                         (to Letty)

                     I don't think I've seen you in two

                     or three years.

                               LETTY

                     Has it been that long?

                               CORT

                     You were with that lawyer.

                               LETTY

                     I'm dating Michael now.

                               CORT

                     Met him in the receiving line. What

                     is it that he does for a living?

                                                              108.

          Michael walks up to Letty and Cort as they speak.

                              LETTY

                    Well, he just got a job...

                              M

                               ICHAEL

                    In the restaurant business.

          Letty looks at Michael, surprised.

                               CORT

                    Speak of the devil.

                        (beat)

                    How did you guys meet again?

                              LETTY

                    At the psych hospital.

                              CORT

                    I would've sent a card, but your

                    aunt and I, we weren't sure if that

                    was the thing to do.

                              LETTY

                    That's fine, Uncle Cort.

                              CORT

                        (to Michael)

                    So you were a volunteer over at the

                    hospital?

                              MICHAEL

                    Something like that.

                              LETTY

                    When he could get time off from the

                    restaurant business.

                              MICHAEL

                        (to Letty)

                    How about a dance?

                              CORT

                    You two go ahead. I'm going to go

                    bother that pretty sister of yours

                    for a dance.

          Cort gives Letty another big, wet kiss.

                              LETTY

                    Bye, Uncle Cort.

                        (to Michael)

                    What's with the lie?

                                                                     109.

                              MICHAEL

                    It wasn't exactly a lie.

                              LETTY

                    Pretty close.

                              MICHAEL

                    People at weddings don't want the

                    truth.

          Michael grabs a glass of champagne from a passing waiter.

                              LETTY

                    It's not good to drink so much with

                    the medication you're on.

                              MICHAEL

                    What's with this music? I'll go

                    talk to the D.J. and see if we

                    can't get something good going.

          Michael heads toward the D.J. and confers with him.    Mr.

          Mayer walks up to Letty.

                              MR. MAYER

                    It's good to see you so happy.

                              LETTY

                    Thanks, dad.

          Michael then walks back to Letty and pulls her out onto the

          dance floor as "Twist and Shout" BOOMS OUT from the speakers.

          Letty's mother departs the dance floor, grimacing. Ruth

          shoots Michael a look of pure pleasure. And everyone begins

          twisting, as we

                                                              CUT TO:

          INT. LIVING ROOM - MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Completely dark.   Silent.

          Letty, in a nightshirt, wanders in, and stumbles through the

          room. She fumbles for the switch on the floor lamp.

          The light comes on, illuminating a small circle.    Just

          outside of it sits Michael.

          H

           e stares straight ahead.    Letty kneels down in front of him.

                                                                    110.

                               LETTY

                    Michael?

                        (beat)

                    Michael? You should come to bed.

          Michael remains focused on the space directly in front of

          him.

                               LETTY

                    Did you take the aspirin and water?

                    You don't want to feel awful in the

                    morning.

                        (beat)

                    I'll get you some.

          Letty begins to stand up. The movement breaks Michael's

          trance. He pulls her back down.

                              LETTY

                    What is it? Are you OK?

                              MICHAEL

                        (strangely calm)

                    Always the drugs.

                              LETTY

                    What?

                              MICHAEL

                    I saw you talking to my Mom.

                              LETTY

                    We both talked to her, Michael.

                    And your dad.

                              MICHAEL

                    Why'd you tell her I wasn't taking

                    my meds?

                              LETTY

                    What do you mean not taking your

                    meds?

                              MICHAEL

                    Why'd you tell?

                              LETTY

                    I didn't talk to her about

                    medications, Michael. Don't be

                    silly.

          Michael beats his hand on the floor.

                                                                     111.

                               MICHAEL

                    Silly?   Silly am I?

                              LETTY

                    Michael, take it easy.

                              MICHAEL

                    Silly, silly, silly.

                              LETTY

                    I think I should call someone.

          Michael reaches out, grabs the floor lamp, and pushes it

          over. He lurches to his feet and pulls Letty to a standing

          position.

                              MICHAEL

                        (screaming)

                    Don't upset my Mom.     Don't you

                    upset my Mom.

                              LETTY

                    Michael, calm down. Please. It's

                    OK.

          Michael knocks some flowers over, then rips apart a pillow.

          Letty hovers in back of him.     He pauses.   She puts her hand

          on his back.

          Michael whirls around.   He slaps Letty's hand away. She

          stumbles backward.

                              LETTY

                    Michael, stop.

          He stares in her direction, but he doesn't respond.      Letty

          can't make a connection.

          Michael shoves his fist through a window.

          Letty grabs the phone.

                              MICHAEL

                    Not my Mom. Not my silly silly

                    Mom.

          Letty runs with the phone. Michael follows her. Letty

          trips. She rights herself. She locks herself in the bathroom.

          INT. BATHROOM, MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - SAME

          M

           ichael POUNDS on the bathroom door.     Letty dials 9-1-1.

                                                                    112.

                              LETTY

                    I've got an emergency.    I'm at...

          Michael HOWLS -- a long, piercing inhuman sound.

                              LETTY

                    1450 North Jenkins. Apartment 2.

                    My boyfriend's out of control.

          On the other side of the door, Michael SCREAMS.    Another

          window SHATTERS.

                              NEIGHBOR (OS)

                    What's going on in there?

                               LETTY

                        (into phone)

                    Please, please, send someone.

                        (beat)

                    No, he's having an attack. He's

                    schizophrenic...

          INT. LIVING ROOM - MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - LATER

          Letty, wearing Michael's tux jacket, is curled up on the

          floor in a fetal position.

          She stares...at the upset flowers, at the ripped-up pillows,

          at a fist-sized hole ripped through an unsturdy wall. Her

          gaze stops on a Spaghetti-O's can, lying empty on the floor.

          KNOCKS on the door.   Letty rises slowly, padding to the door

          like an old woman.

          The KNOCKS grow urgent.   Letty opens the door to Ruth.

          Letty throws herself into Ruth's waiting embrace.

          Immediately, Letty cries.

          After a moment, Letty steps back.

                              LETTY

                    I'm sorry, so sorry.   I never

                    should have called.

          Ruth looks into Letty's eyes.

                              RUTH

                    You did the right thing.

                              LETTY

                    I ruined your wedding night.

                                                                  113.

                              RUTH

                    I'm glad you called. Now, not

                    another word about it.

          Ruth pulls Letty into the apartment and shuts the door behind

          them. It is only then that she sees the destruction in the

          living room. Horror flashes across her face.

                                 RUTH

                    Oh my God.

          Tears stream down Letty's face.   Ruth starts to cry.

                              RUTH

                    Did he hurt you?

          Letty shakes her head "no." Her sobbing intensifies. Ruth

          puts her arm around Letty, and together, they sit on the

          floor.

          Ruth holds Letty until the crying eases.

                              LETTY

                    Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?

                              R

                               UTH

                    You don't have to make any

                    decisions tonight.

                              LETTY

                    But what am I going to do?

                              RUTH

                    Do you want to go see him? I'll

                    take you if you want to go.

                                LETTY

                    I can't.    I can't see him there.

          Ruth holds her close again.

                               LETTY

                    I was so sure. I really thought it

                    would work.

                        (beat)

                    We have plans, Ruth.

                                RUTH

                    I know.    I know.

                                                                 114.

          EXT. SANTA BARBARA MISSION - DAY

          Letty sits on the same bluff she once shared with Michael.

          She smokes a cigarette, and stares out at the ocean.

          EXT. SANTA BARBARA MISSION - LATER

          Letty remains on the bluff, crying. A priest, passing in the

          background looks over at her, and continues on his way.

          EXT. SANTA BARBARA MISSION - NIGHT

          In the darkness, Letty lies on her back. She stares up at

          the moon and stars, bright against the night sky.

          EXT. BOTANICAL GARDENS - DAY

          Letty walks along a pathway with Paul.

                              PAUL

                    I'm glad you agreed to see me.

                              LETTY

                    I'm just glad there aren't any hard

                    feelings.

                              PAUL

                    Oh, none. None. I completely

                    understand what was going on.

                              LETTY

                    Oh.

                              PAUL

                    How's work going?    Are you back at

                    school?

                              LETTY

                    I start on Monday.

                              PAUL

                    So things are back on track?

                              LETTY

                    Getting back.

                              PAUL

                    I heard about your friend.

                              LETTY

                    What?

                                                                   115.

                              PAUL

                    I heard your friend was back in the

                    hospital.

                               LETTY

                    Michael.   Yes.

                              PAUL

                    I just wondered, well, if this

                    meant there was a chance for us.

                    Because I think about you a lot,

                    and I still feel...

                               LETTY

                    Our relationship meant a lot to me,

                    too, Paul. But it's over.

                        (beat)

                    And Michael being in the hospital

                    doesn't really change things.

                              PAUL

                    I think I've heard this speech

                    before.

                              LETTY

                    I'm really sorry.

          Letty reaches up to hug him.    He quickly disengages himself.

                               P

                               AUL

                    I've got a deposition that I really

                    need to get cracking on, so if you

                    don't mind...

                              LETTY

                    Sure, I understand.

          Paul starts down the path.

                              LETTY

                    Wait. Wait.

          Letty runs up to Paul.

                              LETTY

                    I need to give you this.

          Letty hands Paul the engagement ring. He takes it and

          continues walking as she stares after him.

                                                                 116.

          EXT. HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY

          Letty walks up the steps to the imposing facility. We follow

          her journey through the VISITING ROOM, past families

          conversing with patients, to the NURSES' STATION.

          Letty walks up to Nurse Gates, who gives her a quick hug.

          John and Bill watch as Letty signs the visitors' register.

                              NURSE GATES

                    He's in Jamie's old room.

          Letty walks down the HALLWAY and pauses outside Michael's

          door. She KNOCKS.

                               MICHAEL (OS)

                    Come in.

          INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - SAME

          Michael is in the middle of taping up the same Houdini poster

          we saw in his last room when Letty enters.

                               LETTY

                    Hi.

                               MICHAEL

                    Hey.

          Letty and Michael kiss awkwardly.    Dead silence.

                              LETTY/MICHAEL (TOGETHER)

                    How are you?

          They smile nervously.

                              LETTY

                    I guess we need to talk.

                              MICHAEL

                    I guess so.

                              LETTY

                    It's hard to know where to start.

                              MICHAEL

                    Pretend like I'm your shrink.

          Letty rolls her eyes.

                               MICHAEL

                    Sorry.   I'll be quiet.

                                                                   117.

                              LETTY

                    I think about you all the time.

                              MICHAEL

                    I sure know what that feels like.

                              LETTY

                    And all the plans we have.

                              MICHAEL

                    Yeah, the plans.

          Letty looks out the window.

                              LETTY

                    I've been thinking I could try to

                    visit you at night after work, and

                    then there'd be more time on

                    weekends to see...

                              MICHAEL

                    Letty, please.

                              L

                                 LETTY

                    What?

                              MICHAEL

                    Like I've told you before I don't

                    want you taking care of me.

                              LETTY

                    Someone has to take care of you

                    right now, Michael. You tore up

                    the apartment. You stopped taking

                    your medications.

                              MICHAEL

                    But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean

                    to do that.

                              LETTY

                    Well then why'd it happen?

                              MICHAEL

                    I don't know. I don't fucking

                    know.

          Letty and Michael glare at each other.    Letty looks away.

                                 LETTY

                    I'm sorry.     I didn't come here to

                    blame you.

                                                                    118.

                              MICHAEL

                    I didn't mean for any of this to

                    happen.

                              LETTY

                    Oh, God, Michael, I know.

                        (softly)

                    Why does everything have to be so

                    hard?

          Michael shakes his head.

                              LETTY

                    What are we going to do?

                              MICHAEL

                    What do you want to do?

                              LETTY

                    I know I don't want to lose you.     I

                    don't think I could stand it.

                              MICHAEL

                    Yeah, but can you stand to be with

                    me like this?

          Letty waits. She looks away. She turns back and stares into

          Michael's eyes. Finally, she says it.

                               LETTY

                    No. I can't, Michael. I'm so sorry,

                    but I just can't handle all this

                    right now.

          Letty starts to cry.   Tears well up in Michael's eyes.

                               MICHAEL

                    I know.   I can't either.

          Michael sits down on the bed and they hold each other.

                              LETTY

                    I love you so much.

                              MICHAEL

                    I love you too, Letty.     I love you,

                    too.

          Letty and Michael grip each other.    Finally, they pull apart.

                              LETTY

                    Maybe we could just run away to

                    Tahiti and live on the beach.

                                                                 119.

                              MICHAEL

                    That's the best idea I've heard in

                    a long time.

          Letty wipes a tear from Michael's cheek.

                              LETTY

                    Don't you have a magic trick or

                    something to make this easier?

                              MICHAEL

                    How about something better?   Like a

                    kiss.

          T

           he couple kisses more tenderly than ever before.

                              LETTY

                    I can still come visit you, you

                    know.

                              MICHAEL

                    Would that really be such a good

                    idea for either of us?

                              LETTY

                    Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?

                              MICHAEL

                    I will. And you make sure you take

                    care of yourself.

          Michael puts his hand under Letty's chin and draws her head

          up so he can look into her eyes.

                              MICHAEL

                    Promise you won't fall for any guys

                    pretending to be doctors.

          Letty shakes her head "no" as tears stream down her face.

                              LETTY

                    I guess I should go now.

                              MICHAEL

                    You should go.

          Letty stands up and walks toward the door. She comes back

          and embraces Michael again. Slowly, they separate, and Letty

          leaves the room. Michael stares out the window.

                                                                 120.

          EXT. HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - SAME

          Letty walks out the door, down the steps and along the front

          walkway -- until, finally, the hospital recedes in the

          distance.

          INT. CLASSROOM - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

          Letty sits on top of a desk. Children of all ages stare her

          down. A few familiar faces--Bobby and Jenny--grace the room.

          Principal Gail passes outside the window and glances in.

                               LETTY

                    First of all, I want to welcome you

                    to MathShop. I have lots of fun

                    games planned for us.

                        (beat)

                    Let's see, Bobby, can you help me

                    pass out these cards?

          Bobby doesn't move.

                              LETTY

                    Is something wrong, Bobby?

                              BOBBY

                    Why were you gone so long?

                              JENNY

                    My mom said you went crazy.

                              LETTY

                    I had what some people call a

                    nervous breakdown. I wasn't

                    dealing with life so well so I

                    went...

                              BOBBY

                    To a place for psychos.

                              LETTY

                    To a psychiatric institution.

                              J

                               ENNY

                    What's that?

                               LETTY

                    It's a place where you figure out

                    what you want, and what things in

                    your life aren't working. You

                    learn to look out for yourself and

                    not get...

                                                                 121.

          Letty trails off. She sees that she's lost the class. Bobby

          launches a spit wad that hits the boy in front of him.

                              LETTY

                    Let me show you the best thing I

                    learned.

          She walks up to Bobby. He twists around in his seat, trying

          to hide the rest of his supply of spit wads.

          Letty waves her hand around Bobby's head. The children,

          stare, delighted. She pulls a bright coin out of his ear,

          and hands it to him.

                              CHILDREN (TOGETHER)

                    Wow./ Neat./ Do it again, Miss

                    Mayer.

          Letty puts her hands behind her back and produces a bouquet

          of paper flowers. Now, she's got the class hooked.

                                                           FADE OUT

                                     THE END
