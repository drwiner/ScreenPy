	"THE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS"

	FADE IN:

	JACK BAKER

	is standing before a dirty window, looking

	out at a dirty city street.  He is wearing a tuxedo.

				VOICE (O.S.)

		Hey.

	WIDEN ANGLE

	It's the GIRL from this afternoon.

				JACK

		Hey.

	Jack looks at the Girl, sleepy and warm under the

	bedcovers, then at the rest of the apartment.  

	Not good.

				GIRL

		Whatcha doin' over there?

				JACK

		Gotta go.

				GIRL

		How come?

				JACK

		Job.

	The Girl glances at the bedside clock.

				GIRL

		Funny hours.

				JACK

		Funny job.

				GIRL

		Will I see you again?

	Jack looks out at the dirty street again.

				JACK

		No.

	The Girl doesn't appear terribly unnerved by this.

				GIRL

			(at the tux)

		You weren't wearing that, were

		you? Earlier.

	Jack shakes his head, taps a brown paper bag on

	the sill.

				JACK

		Brought it.

				GIRL

		Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.

				JACK

		Thanks.

				GIRL

		I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone

		who wore that shit.

	Jack smiles, grabs the paper bag, and moves to

	the door.

				GIRL

			(continuing)

		Hey.

			(as he stops)

		You got great hands.

	EXT.  STREET - JACK

	Jack ain't exactly Cary Grant, but any guy wearing

	a tux on these streets doesn't exactly mesh with

	the milieu.  Pausing for a flask of whiskey at an

	all-night liquor store, he breaks the seal before

	he hits the sidewalk and moves on, drinking as he

	goes.  Finally, he comes to a nice downtown hotel.  

	Slipping the bottle in his coat, he squints up at

	the glittering building as if sizing up an opponent.

				DOORMAN

		Hey, Jackie!

				JACK

		How goes it, Tommy?

				TOMMY (DOORMAN)

			(shrugging)

		Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?

				JACK

		Losing his teeth.

				TOMMY

		No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox.

		I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust

		the taps.

				JACK

		Yeah.

			(standing back)

		Jesus, you look like fucking

		royalty, Tommy.

	Tommy brushes at his new velvet coat.

				TOMMY

		Yeah.  The big boys sent it down

		yesterday.

				JACK

		Another five years, huh?

				TOMMY

		Like clockwork.  You got a good

		memory, Jackie.

				JACK

		It ain't always a blessing.  My

		brother here?

				TOMMY

			(nodding)

		He's got blood in his eye.

	Jack glances at his watch, waves to Tommy, and

	moves into the hotel.

	INT.  HOTEL - ANGLE ON FRANK

	Jack's older brother, FRANK, is pacing outside the

	lounge when he sees Jack approaching.

				FRANK

		Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could

		make it.

				JACK

		How we doing?

				FRANK

		How we ... ? What, are you kidding

		me?

				JACK

		Am I late?

				FRANK

		That's not the point.

				JACK

			(taking out a cigarette)

		What's the point?

				FRANK

		You cannot continue to walk in at

		the last moment, Jack.

				JACK

		You want me to show up late a few

		nights?

				FRANK

		Jack.

				JACK

		Frank.

				FRANK

		Jack.

				JACK

		Frank.  I'm here.  I always get

		here.  Don't sweat it.

				FRANK

		Christ, will you look at your hair?

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Jack turns to the wall, which is paneled in tiny

	tinted mirrors shot through with veins of gold.

				JACK

		What's wrong with it?

				FRANK

		You look like you just crawled out

		of bed.

				JACK

		No one's gonna be looking at my

		hair.  Come on, we're on.

	Frank just stands there, bottled up with

	exasperation.

				JACK

			(continuing)

		Careful, Frank.  When you get angry your

		tie starts to spin.

	Jack steps into the lounge and Frank, shaking his

	head, follows.  As they move away, a cardboard

	stand-up is revealed.  On it are two 8 X 10 glossies

	of Frank and Jack, and below printed in bold letters,

	this: "Tonight!  The Doubly Delightful Tones of the

	Fabulous Baker Boys!"

	BAKER BROTHERS

	as they make their way through the dimly-lit lounge

	and settle behind matching pianos, it becomes apparent

	that what the "Fabulous Baker Boys" are, in fact, is a

	poor man's version of Ferrante and Teicher.

	WIDER ANGLE INCLUDING LOUNGE

	As they begin to plink out their "theme song" tables

	of middle-aged couples sipping enormous banana

	daiquiries begin to tap their feet and bob their heads.

	After a few bars, the boys finish with a flourish and

	the couples applaud.

				FRANK

			(Mr.  Smile)

		Thank you.  Thank you.  Good evening and welcome

		to the Starfire lounge.  My name is Frank Baker

		and eighty-eight keys across from me is my

		little brother, Jack.

	Applause.  Little brother Jack smiles, winks, and takes

	a draw on his cigarette.

				FRANK

			(continuing; could do this in his sleep)

		You know, my brother and I have been playing

		together, gosh, I don't know.  How long has it

		been, Jack?

				JACK

		Twenty-eight years, Frank.

	Applause.

				FRANK

		That's a lot of water under the

		bridge, eh, Jack?

				JACK

		Lotta water.

				FRANK

		Of course, back then, things were a little

		different.  I was eight, Jack was seven, just

		about the only song we knew was 'My Bonnie

		Lies Over the Ocean', and the only one who would

		listen to us was the family cat, Cecil.

			(to Jack)

		We must have shaved three lives off that cat,

		eh, Jack?

	Laughter. Jack smiles like he's got a mouth full of

	razor blades.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		But seriously.  It's been fifteen years since

		Jack and I first stepped on the stage as

		professionals. Three states, sixty-eight cities,

		and more-grayhairs-then-we'd-like-to-admit later...

		well, believe me, we've seen our share of this

		crazy country of ours.  But even though we've

		played some of the finest venues in the world ...

	At this point, Jack begins to mimic his brother's words.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		... There's one place that's always been, for us,

		a very special place, and that place is... this

		place, the Starfire lounge.

	Jack lays in a few soft bass chords.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Why?  Well, I guess you could just say it's

		the ...

			(pregnant moment)

		... people.

	At which point Frank's hands descend onto the keyboard

	and give birth to the melody of -- what else?  "People.'

	JACK AND FRANK - LATER

	They exit the stage to applause.

				FRANK

		Thank you.  Remember, room service is available

	till one A.M. for you late-nighters.

	INT.  HOTEL KITCHEN

	Jack and Frank pass through the steamy hotel kitchen.

				FRANK

		Don't make trouble, all right?

				JACK

		Who's gonna make trouble?

			(spotting someone)

		Hey, amigo!

	JACK'S POV - MAN

	in an apron, cutting meat off a huge soup bone,

	looks up.

	BACK TO SCENE

				MAN

		Jack!

			(lower)

		Frank.

				FRANK

			(the feeling's mutual)

		Yeah, hi, Hector.

				HECTOR (MAN)

			(re: the soup bone)

		For Eddie.  I wrap.

				JACK

		Gracias.

				FRANK

			(as they exit)

		I mean it, Jack.  Behave.

				JACK

		Like an angel.

	INT.  OFFICE

	Frank stands across the desk from a YOUNG MAN who,

	despite his youth, has an irritatingly paternal

	attitude toward the two men in his office.  Jack stays

	in the doorway, smoking a cigarette, as if to venture

	any further is to risk contracting some hideous

	disease.

				LLOYD (YOUNG MAN)

			(preparing a cash envelope)

		Terrific, boys.  Really.  Terrific.

				FRANK

		Thanks, Lloyd.

				LLOYD

		Yes, sir.  You're just what we needed on a night

		like this.

				FRANK

		Uh ... thanks.

	Frank glances at Jack and realizes he should have left

	him in the kitchen with Hector and the soup bone.

				LLOYD

		Only, Jack, do me a favor, will ya, pal?  If you

		wanna smoke, put on a pair of sunglasses and go

		play with the niggers on State Street.  These

		blisters from the midwest don't wanna watch some

		guy dripping ash all over himself while he's

		playing 'The Sound of Music.'

	ANGLE - JACK

	Smoke curls out of Jack's nose.  He is utterly still,

	like a pit bull eyeing a steak.

	BACK TO SCENE

				LLOYD

		Okay, boys, that ought to buy you a few more

	lessons.  By the way, Frankie, I'm declaring this.

	Lloyd slaps a slender envelope onto the desk and,

	business closed, busies himself with other matters.

				FRANK

		Uh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us

	back, do you, Lloyd?

				LLOYD

		I'll call you.

				FRANK

		Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I

	thought maybe...

				LLOYD

		I'll call you.

	Frank bites down and takes the envelope from the desk.

				JACK

		Count it.

				FRANK

		Huh?

				JACK

		Count it.

				FRANK

		Jack...

				JACK

		Count the fucking money, Frank.

	Lloyd looks up.  Jack is staring right into him.

	Reluctantly, Frank opens the envelope.

				FRANK

		It's all here.

			(pulling Jack out)

		I'll be talking to you, Lloyd.

	Lloyd doesn't answer.  He just looks at Jack, smiling

	with amusement.

	EXT.  STREET - JACK AND FRANK

	Jack comes out onto the street holding the wrapped

	soup bone, dogged by Frank, who's got the cardboard

	stand-up under his arm.

				FRANK

		You mind telling me what that was about in there?

		Was that planned?  

		Or were you just bored and decided

		to get creative?

				JACK

		Fuck him.

				FRANK

		This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on

		Route 81, Jack.

				JACK

		Fuck him.

				FRANK

			(to himself)

		Fuck him.  Great.  Terrific.  Fuck him.

	The fabulous Bakers walk in silence until they come to

	Frank's car. Frank opens the trunk and starts to put

	the stand-up away.

				JACK

		So we on tomorrow night?

				FRANK

			(shaking his head)

		Maybe Thursday.  I hear the harpist at the

		Sheraton's got appendicitis.

	Jack nods and starts to walk away.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Hey.

	Jack stops.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Listen ... why don't you come out to the house

		this weekend.  Say hello to the kids.  

		They've grown.

				JACK

		I hate your kids, Frank.

				FRANK

		You're their uncle.

				JACK

		Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.

				FRANK

		They don't.  They're always asking about you.

				JACK

		They tried to electrocute me, Frank.

				FRANK

		It was an accident.

				JACK

		It was no fucking accident, Frank. The little

		one ...

				FRANK

		Cindy.

				JACK

		She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub.  

		How do you explain that?

				FRANK

		She didn't know what she was doing.

		You're too sensitive.

				JACK

		You got weird kids, Frank.

				FRANK

		Look, I just thought if you came out you might

		see what you're missing.

	Jack just stares at Frank.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Just think about it, all right?

		Consider it a standing offer.

	Frank closes the trunk and moves to the driver's side.

				FRANK

			(continuing;like a litany)

		You want a ride, Jack?  No, Frank,

		I'll walk.  Okay, Jack, good night.

		Good night, Frank.

	Frank turns the ENGINE OVER and pulls away from the curb.

	Jack watches the taillights burn into the distance,

	then takes the whiskey bottle from his coat and heads

	for home.

	ANGLE - APARTMENT BUILDING

	Jack crosses the street and waves up to his apartment

	building, where a black labrador is studying him from

	a second story window.

	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT

	Jack's apartment is small, old, and comfortably

	cluttered.  The most striking item is a vintage phone

	booth placed against the wall.  As Jack lets himself in,

	EDDIE, the dog from the window, walks over.  He is not

	an overly enthusiastic dog, but you can see from his

	face that he has a great deal of affection for Jack.

				JACK

		Hi, pal.  Thought you were gonna clean the

		apartment.

	Eddie nuzzles the soup bone.  Jack unwraps the paper

	and hands it over.

				JACK

			(continuing)

		Take it easy, will ya?  You're becoming a regular

		Johhny Appleseed the way you're dropping teeth

		around here.

	Jack hangs his tie on the phone booth and walks over

	to an old phonograph stacked six deep with discs.  

	He lifts the records back up the post and clicks ON the

	MACHINE.  As Bill Evans' smoky "PEACE PIECE" fills the

	tiny apartment, Jack breaks the collar of his shirt and

	walks over to the old piano near the window.  Settling

	back with the bottle of whiskey, Jack rests his elbows

	gently on the keys and stares out the open window,

	listening to the music.

	INT.  PIANO STORE

	Jack and Frank work opposite sides of a large piano

	showroom, inspecting rentals of every style and color.

	WILLIE, the owner of the place, leans against a cheap

	upright, contemplating his shoes.

				FRANK

		What happened to the two Clays, Willie?

				WILLIE

		Out.

				FRANK

		When they coming in?

				WILLIE

		Wednesday next.

		Frank looks across the room at Jack.

				FRANK

		What d'ya got?,

				JACK

		Bosen black.

			(taps a key)

		Flat.

				FRANK

		What d'you say, Willie?  Tighten her up?

				WILLIE

		What's the gig?

				FRANK

		Two nights.

	Willie just looks at his shoes and shakes his head.

	Frank frowns and glances around.

	Across the room, Jack pauses before another piano.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		What d'ya got?

				JACK

			(tapping)

		Yamaha white.  Nice.

	Frank moves to another grand and alternates taps with

	his brother to see if the two pianos are in harmony.

				FRANK

		What do you think?

				JACK

		Try the black Knable.

	Frank moves to another piano and repeats the process,

	watching Jack for a verdict.

	After a moment, Jack nods.

				FRANK

		Tag 'em, Willie.  The Regency downtown,

		Thursday-Friday.  Thanks.

				WILLIE

		My pleasure.

	INT.  DINER

	The brothers sit at a window of a corner diner,

	Jack nursing an ice coffee,

	Frank playing with a plate of scrambled eggs.  

	The glass next to them is cluttered with photographs

	of neighborhood luminaries,

	including two of Jack and Frank in their tuxedoes.

				FRANK

		You know, I think it's been five years since I

		saw you eat anything. That's the God's truth.

				JACK

		Trust me, you're not missing anything.

				FRANK

		You look awful.

				JACK

		Thanks.

				FRANK

		Really.  You sleeping?

				JACK

		Only on odd days.

				FRANK

			(a look)

		Seeing anyone in particular?

				JACK

		Why the interest?

				FRANK

		Because I'm your brother.  Because I care about

		you. Because sometimes it seems like the most

		significant relationship in your life is with

		that goddamn dog of yours.

	Jack studies his brother's face.

				JACK

		I'm not seeing anyone.  In particular.

				FRANK

		What about that waitress at the Ambassador?

				JACK

		Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?

				FRANK

		Funny.

			(points at his wedding band)

		Strike a bell?

				JACK

		It's only a ring.  Not a collar.

				FRANK

		It's more than that.

	Jack smiles and sips his coffee.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow.

				JACK

		No thanks.

				FRANK

		No, I mean it.

				JACK

		So do I.

				FRANK

		We gotta go, Jack.

				JACK

		No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up

		there every couple weeks you feel guilty.  

		I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go.

				FRANK

		This time you gotta go.

				JACK

		I don't gotta go.

				FRANK

		You gotta go.

				JACK

		Says who?

				FRANK

		Your older brother.

				JACK

		You're thirteen months older than me, Frank.

		That might've meant something in the Apache

		clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.

				FRANK

		Christ, Jack, it's her birthday.

	Jack glances up.  Frank nods.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		So what do you say?

		Think the city can spare you for an afternoon?

	Jack squints out the window.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Okay.  And don't worry about a present.

		I got her something from both of us.

	EXT.  STREET

	Jack, cradling a pink bakery box in one hand,

	gets out of Frank's car and surveys the street

	on which he grew up.

				FRANK

		Make sure you lock.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Unless you count the elderly gentleman picking roses

	three houses down, there would not appear to be a wealth

	of potential car thieves in the immediate vicinity.

	But it's not Jack's car, so he doesn't press the point.

	BACK TO SCENE

				FRANK

		Place looks good, huh?  I got a neighbor boy to

		mow the lawn, pick up. Five bucks.  

		Times've changed, huh?

			(pointing)

		See the tree?

		Remember the job Cecil did on it the day

		Dad planted it?

		You can still see the scars on the trunk.  Really.

		I was looking at it just the other day.

		Jesus, I thought he was gonna kill that cat.

	Frank smiles, recalling Cecil's near-demise,

	then raps on the front door.

	Jack studies the tree a moment,

	then gestures to the tiny ribboned box in Frank's hand.

				JACK

		So what'd we get her?

				FRANK

		You'll see.

	ANGLE - FRONT DOOR

	At that moment, the door swings open and ELLIE BAKER

	is there, a vibrant woman in her sixties.

				MRS. BAKER

		Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys!

				FRANK

		How's the birthday girl?

				MRS. BAKER

		A little stiffer, but just as sturdy.

	Mrs. Baker hugs Frank, then, a bit awkwardly,

	embraces Jack.

				MRS. BAKER

			(continuing)

		John.  It's good to see you.

				JACK

			(uncomfortable; balancing cake box)

		Good to see you, Ma.

	Jack looks over his mother's shoulder at Frank and

	mimics "John" with a knowing nod.

				FRANK

		Uh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore.

		Jack. He goes by Jack.

				MRS. BAKER

		I thought maybe held gotten over that.

				FRANK

		Twenty years, Ma ...

				MRS. BAKER

		Yes, yes.  It's just that John is so much nicer.

		Jack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl,

		we had a pig on the farm named Jack.

		I guess I just can't help making the association.

	Jack's eyes slide over to Frank as if to suggest he

	holds his brother personally responsible for this.

				FRANK

		Uh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma,

		John Kennedy went by Jack.

				MRS. BAKER

		Catholics.  What do you expect?  

		Oh, well, what's in a name, right?

		Let's go inside and have a look at that cake.

	As Mrs. Baker exits, Frank leans over to Jack.

				FRANK

		Keep her busy, will ya?

		I have to set a few things up.

	Frank disappears, leaving Jack alone on the porch

	with the bakery box.  Jack shakes his head,

	wondering how he's going to make it through the afternoon,

	then enters the house.

	INT.  HOUSE

	The front room is cluttered with his childhood.  

	Most noticeable are the pianos: two tiny uprights,

	perfectly matched, their simulated ivory keys yellowed

	with age.  Above them, pressed between glass and framed,

	are the music ribbons, faded by twenty years of sunlight.

	Finally, there is the sheet music, dusty and dog-eared,

	piled everywhere in drunken stacks.

	This and all else in the room Jack confronts slowly,

	warily, but with a noticeable dispassion,

	until his eyes fall upon a photograph.

	In it, he and Frank are standing alonside a tall man

	in baggy slacks, safe within the arc of his long arms.

	Frank is staring straight into the camera, neat, clean,

	perfectly posed, but Jack, a year younger,

	his shirt too big, is caught in profile,

	looking up at the tall man with an almost worshipful gaze.

				MRS.  BAKER

			(entering)

		Well, now, where's everyone run off to?

		Frank?

				JACK

		Downstairs.

				MRS. BAKER

		Oh.

	All at once, Jack and his mother realize they are alone.

				MRS. BAKER

		Well, shall we cut that cake?

	Jack nods and follows her into the kitchen.

	He places the box on the table and stands off to the

	side while Mrs. Baker sets about preparing things.

				MRS. BAKER

		So. How are you?

				JACK

		Fine.  You?

				MRS. BAKER

		Oh, fine.

	Silence.

	Jack watches his mother poise the knife over the cake.

	Her fingers are trembling.

				MRS. BAKER

			(continuing)

		Big piece or little?

				JACK

		Huh? Oh, no.

				MRS. BAKER

		None?

				JACK

		I'm not much for sweets.

	Mrs. Baker nods.

				MRS. BAKER

		How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?

				JACK

		Eddie.

				MRS. BAKER

		Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?

				JACK

		He's losing his teeth.

	Mrs. Baker stops and looks up into Jack's eyes.

	Suddenly, a NOISE is heard in the other room.

				MRS. BAKER

		Sounds like your brothers back with us.

	INT.  KITCHEN - DAY

	Frank comes stumbling up the basement stairs with an

	old movie projector and a roll-up screen.

				MRS. BAKER

			(entering)

		What's all this?

	Frank sets the projector down and hands his mother the

	tiny ribboned box.

				FRANK

		Go on.

	Jack watches from the kitchen doorway as Mrs. Baker

	pulls the ribbon off the box.  

	Inside is a tiny spool of film.

				MRS.  BAKER

		Why, what's this?

	INT.  KITCHEN (LATER)

	Blank screen, curtains drawn, the room dark.  

	Frank clicks on the projector and picks up his cake.  

	Mrs. Baker close on his elbow,

	sets her plate on her knees and watches the screen.  

	Jack sits off to the side.  

	A title card appears:

	"For Mrs. Ellie Baker, who made it all possible."

	Mrs. Baker gives Frank a puzzled look.  

	He just smiles.

	Suddenly, images spring to the screen,

	obviously footage several years old,

	showing Jack and Frank as children,

	sitting at the tiny pianos, wearing matching suits,

	smiling matching smiles as they play for the camera.

				MRS. BAKER

		Oh my God ...

				FRANK

		Recognize these two characters?

				MRS. BAKER

		I thought these were lost.  

		Where did you find ...

				FRANK

		In the attic.  Behind some of Dad's stuff.

			(pointing with his fork)

		Look, Jack can hardly reach the pedals.

	As Frank's laughter fills the dark room,

	Jack stares with cold fascination at the screen.  

	Suddenly, a jagged cut springs the boys a year later,

	in the same positions, smiling the same smiles.

				MRS. BAKER

			(laughing)

		Oh no!

				FRANK

		I had a boy down at the camera shop cut them

		all together.  Boy, old man Henderson didn't

		fool around when he gave a haircut, did he, Jack?

	Jack says nothing.

				MRS. BAKER

		Oh, look at you two.  So skinny.

		And those tiny suits ...

				FRANK

		Wait.  Watch.  Here comes Dad.

	Jack's eyes narrow as the film jumps another year

	and a man enters the frame, obviously by accident.  

	He is so tall his face cannot be seen.  

	As he dances quickly out of sight,

	he ruffles Jack's hair.

				MRS. BAKER

		That man.

	As the film jumps again,

	Jack glances at the photograph to his right.

	The images on the screen flicker softly off

	the glass of the picture frame.

				MRS.  BAKER (O.S.)

			(continuing)

		Oh, look how you're growing.

		My little boys ...

	Jack's eyes drift from the photograph to his mother

	and brother, sitting close together in the love seat,

	laughing.  After a moment, their voices fade and Jack

	looks back to the children on the screen,

	like two tiny men, mirror images of one another.

	At first the changes are subtle.  

	Little Jack's tie is askew, his shirt missing a button.

	But as the years flick by, the brothers resemble one

	another less and less, until finally,

	the little boy that was Jack is completely gone and in

	his place is a slouching, tousle-haired adolescent in

	rumpled coat and open collar,

	a cigarette hanging disdainfully from his lip.  

	A woman's hand darts into the frame and plucks the

	offending cigarette away in a flash.

	INT.  CAR

	Frank and Jack are parked in front of Jack's building.

	Whispers of steam snake from the

	mancovers in the street.

				JACK

		I made her nervous.

				FRANK

		What do you mean?

				JACK

		Her hands.  Like that.

	Jack holds out a trembling hand.

				FRANK

		Nah.  Medication.

	Jack looks over at Frank.  He nods.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Couple years, now.

			(taps his heart)

		Keeps the beat steady.  Nothing serious.

	Jack considers this a moment, then gets out of the car.

				FRANK

		She was glad to see you.

	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT

	Jack lets himself into his apartment and stops.

	Across the room, curled up on the couch, is a little girl.

	Jack takes the girl gently in his arms and carries her to

	the bedroom.  As he folds a blanket under her chin,

	he pauses. The girl's face is calm, peaceful.

	EXT.  STREET - DAWN

	The next morning.  Early.  

	The sun is peeking sleepily between the buildings and

	beginning to drip out onto the street.  Suddenly,

	RINGING OUT over the rooftops, is "JINGLE BELLS"

	-- not the entire song, just the first two bars,

	over and over.

	IHT.  JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Jack, on the couch, his arm draped over a slumbering

	Eddie, opens his eyes.  Across the room,

	seated at the piano, is NINA, the little girl.

	She stops playing and turns.

				NINA

		Morning.  You want coffee?  I made coffee.

	Jack looks into the sleepy face of Eddie and sits up.

	He nods to the coffee.  Nina goes to the kitchen.

				NINA

			(continuing)

		I did the dishes last night. You're missing a cup.

	Jack rubs his head, then gets up and walks to the window.

				NINA

			(continuing)

		Did you break a cup, Jack?

				JACK

		Eddie did.

	Nina looks at Eddie, sleeping on the couch,

	then brings Jack his coffee with both hands.

				NINA

		I practiced the piano last night.  Two hours.

		I think I'm ready for 'Jingle all the way.'

	Jack nods.  Suddenly, the sound of HEAVY FOOTSTEPS is heard.

	Jack and Nina glance up at the ceiling.

				NINA

			(continuing)

		Guess they're up.

				JACK

		Sounds big.  What's he do?

				NINA

		Process server.

		Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours

		are more regular.  All I know's he came to take

		the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for

		dinner.  And breakfast.

				JACK

		What happened to the donut king?

				NINA

		Married.

	Upstairs, a DOOR SLAMS and HEAVY FEET ECHO in the

	stairwell. Nina peers out the window.

				NINA

		No breakfast.  Maybe they had a fight.

	TWO DEEP THUMPS sound on the ceiling.

				NINA

			(continuing)

		Well, gotta go.  Teach me later?

	Jack nods.

	Nina kisses him on the cheek and exits.

	Jack walks over to the couch and gives Eddie a nudge.

				JACK

		Hey.

	INT.  LUAU LOUNGE

	Though the plastic palms and grass-skirted waitresses

	of the Luau Lounge make the Fabulous Baker Boys' presence

	seem a bit incongruous, Jack and Frank hold nothing back,

	giving "McCarthur Park" the full treatment.  

	Unfortunately, the audience in the Luau Lounge wouldn't

	fill a Hawaiian haystack and their applause

	is less than volcanic.

				FRANK

		Uh, thank you.  That concludes our show for this

		evening.  Jack and I only hope you enjoyed

		yourselves as much as we did.

	As the guests wander out, clutching their roomkeys,

	a freckle-faced BELLHOP comes up.

				BELLHOP

		Mr. Baker.

				FRANK

			(tired)

		Yeah, Jimmy.

				JIMMY (BELLHOP)

		Mr. Simpson asked to see you.

				FRANK

		All right, tell him I'll be right there.

	As Jimmy exits, Frank stands and points at Jack.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Tomorrow we close with the 'Aquarius Suite.'

	INT.  HOTEL CORRIDOR

		Frank pauses before a door marked "HOTEL MANAGER."

		It's half-open.  Inside, CHARLIE SIMPSON,

		a heavy man in a shiny suit,

		is throwing darts in the general direction of a

		dartboard.  He's not very good.  Frank knocks.

				CHARLIE

		Frankie.

				FRANK

		You wanted to see me, Charlie?

	ANOTHER ANGLE

				CHARLIE

		Yeah, come on in.

				FRANK

		Little slow tonight.

				CHARLIE

			(waving it off)

		Mondays.

	Charlie takes an envelope from his desk and hands it

	to Frank.

				FRANK

		What's this?

				CHARLIE

		Your pay.

				FRANK

		Now?  Why not tomorrow?  After the show.

				CHARLIE

		Take it now.

				FRANK

			(confused)

		What about tomorrow?

				CHARLIE

		We don't need you, Frankie.

	For a moment, Frank just stands there.

				FRANK

		I've got the grands for two nights,

		Charlie.  You can't just --

				CHARLIE

		It's all there.  Both nights.

	Frank looks at the envelope in his hands.

				FRANK

		What're you saying, Charlie?

				CHARLIE

		Look, Frankie.  You and Jack been

		playing here, a long time.

				FRANK

		Twelve years.

				CHARLIE

		Right, twelve years.  Couple times

		a month.

				FRANK

		So?

				CHARLIE

		So maybe it's time we took a vacation from

		each other.

				FRANK

		Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night.

		You said so yourself.

				CHARLIE

		It wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie.

		I got six waiters standing in back listening

		to baseball.  I gotta move the liquor.  

		To move the liquor, I gotta fill the tables.  

		It's a matter of economics.  Me, I love you.

		I love both you guys, you know that.  

		You're class.  But people today.  

		They don't know class if it walks up and

		grabs 'em by the balls.

	INT.  HOTEL LOBBY

	Jack rises as Frank passes through the lobby with

	the cardboard stand-up.

				JACK

		What's with Charlie?

				FRANK

		Nothing.  Everything's great.

		Terrific.

	INT.  FRANK'S HOUSE

	With the stand-up under his arm,

	Frank enters and closes the door quietly.  

	A light is glowing in the kitchen.  

	The rest of the house is dark, quiet.  In the kitchen,

	he checks the message pad by the phone.  Nothing.  

	On the table, a plate of cold chicken is waiting for him.

	Next to it is a stack of bills with a note attached:

	"Frank. Please."

	Frank sighs and leans the stand-up against the wall.  

	The photo of Jack is peeling off the cardboard.  

	Finding a stack of glossies in a drawer,

	Frank removes the old Jack from the stand-up and

	replaces it with a new one.  

	As he presses the photograph in place,

	his eyes drift to the one of himself.  

	It was taken a long time ago.

	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT

	Jack places a record on the turntable and sits at the

	piano by the window.  As the needle hits the spinning

	disc, a sharp, snappy BASS LINE REVERBERATES throughout

	the apartment.  Jack takes a drink, then joins in with

	the record, playing along.  His concentration is intense,

	so much so that, a moment later, when the PHONE RINGS,

	he seems not to hear it.  Finally, he picks it up.

				JACK

		Yeah?

				FRANK (V.0.)

		It's me.

				JACK

		Frank?

				FRANK (V.0.)

		Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the

		house tomorrow, will ya?

				JACK

		I've had enough family for one

		month, Frank.

				FRANK (V.0.)

		It's not family.  It's business.

				JACK

		So talk to me tomorrow.  After

		the gig.

				FRANK (V.0.)

		We don't get a gig.

				JACK

		What're you talking about?

				FRANK (V.0.)

		Something came up.  Don't worry,

		Charlie stayed true.  Both nights.

		I'll give you your share tomorrow.

		At the house.

	Silence.

				FRANK (V.0)

			(continuing)

		So you'll come out, right?

				JACK

		Yeah, okay.

	Jack listens to the PHONE HISSING in the dark,

	then the CONNECTION goes DEAD.

	EXT.  STREET

	A taxi lets Jack off on a street of shabby tract houses.  

	In his rumpled city suit, Jack looks like a cheap

	gangster amid the weedy lawns and overgrown junipers.  

	He walks up to the door of a small white house and

	presses the doorbell.

	When there is no response, he goes around to the back.

	EXT. BACKYARD

	The backyard is small, with a short chainlink fence

	surrounding it.  Two kids, a girl and a boy,

	are splashing around in a build-it-yourself

	above-ground pool.  

	When they see Jack, they stop splashing.

	Only their heads are visible above the water.

				JACK

		Hey, kids.  Dad home?

	The two heads say nothing.

				JACK

			(continuing)

		What d'ya say?  Wanna run and get

		him for me?

	Still nothing.  Jack frowns, takes out a cigarette,

	and pats his pocket for a match.

				JACK

			(continuing)

		Shit.

	The kids' eyes widen at his profanity.  

	Jack, the unlit cigarette dangling from his lip,

	ponders things for a moment,

	then flicks the'cigarette away and steps over the fence.

	At which point,

	the tinier of the two heads in the pool begins to scream.

				JACK

			(continuing)

		Hey, kid.  Take it easy.

	No use.  The kid's a world-class screamer.  

	Frank, wearing baggy shorts and looking alarmed,

	comes racing out of the house.

				FRANK

		Cindy!  What is it?

	Cindy points.  At Jack.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Jack.

				JACK

		Your doorbell doesn't work.

				FRANK

		Honey, it's only Uncle Jack.  You

		remember Uncle Jack.

	DONNA, Frank's wife, appears.

				DONNA

		What's the matter?  Jack?

	Jack waves.

				FRANK

			(lifting Cindy out of the pool)

		Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart?

				DONNA

		I'll take her inside.  You too,

		little Frank.  Out of the pool.

	Donna shepherds the kids toward the house.

				FRANK

		Feet!

	The kids wipe their dripping feet on the outside mat

	and disappear into the house.  Frank turns to Jack.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		It's probably the excitement of

		seeing you again.

	EXT.  BACKYARD (LATER)

	Donna comes out of the house with a tray of lemonade.

	The men are sitting by the pool in a pair of webbed

	aluminum chairs.

				FRANK

		Well, look at this.

				DONNA

		You bring trunks, Jack?

				JACK

		Trunks?

				DONNA

		Swimming trunks.

				JACK

		Oh. No. Strictly dryland.

				DONNA

		Too bad.  You could use some sun.

		Really.

				JACK

		Maybe next time.

				DONNA

		We have some lotion.

				JACK

		Just the same.

				DONNA

		Suit yourself.

	Donna returns to the house.

	Frank takes a sip of his lemonade and scans his

	surroundings complacently.

				FRANK

		Nice, huh?

				JACK

		What?

				FRANK

		The trees.  The flowers.  Nice.

				JACK

		Terrific.

				FRANK

			(expansively)

		Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring.

		After the rains.  Look good as new.

				JACK

		You ask me out here to sell me

		your house, Frank?

	Frank shakes the ice in his glass.

				JACK

			(continuing)

		Charlie paid you off last night,

		didn't he?

				FRANK

		I don't know what you mean.

				JACK

		The hell you don't.

				FRANK

		I told you.  Something came up.

		Some political dinner or something.

				JACK

		Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank.

		No one paid us off.

				FRANK

		It wasn't like that.

				JACK

		No?

				FRANK

		No.

				JACK

		What was it like?

				FRANK

		Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right?  

		I got two kids. I got a wife.

		Besides, he made the deal.  

		There's no shame in it.

				JACK

		That how you see it?

				FRANK

		Yeah, that's how I see it.

	Jack shakes his head in disgust.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		And don't go shaking your head, little brother.

		I'm not the one who walks in every night smelling

		like he's got a day job in a piss factory.

			(pause)

		It killed him, you know.

	Jack glances up.  Dangerous territory.

				JACK

		A gust of wind killed him.

				FRANK

		Yeah, and what put him up there?

				JACK

		Hey, you weren't there.  Right?

	Jack's look ends this.  Frank sighs.

				FRANK

		Look, can we forget last night?

		We gotta talk.

				JACK

		Talk.

				FRANK

		I been thinking maybe we should

		make some changes.

			(pause)

		I been thinking maybe we should

		take on a singer.

	Silence.

				JACK

		Sure, why not.

				FRANK

		It's just an idea.  I want your opinion.

		I mean, we go halfway on everything, right?

				JACK

		It's more like 40-60, wouldn't

		you say?

				FRANK

		We agreed that if I took care of the business;

		I'd be entitled to the extra.

		Isn't that what we agreed?

				JACK

		That's what we agreed.

				FRANK

		If you're unhappy with the

		arrangement --

				JACK

		I'm not unhappy.

				FRANK

		If you'd like to assume more of the financial

		responsibilities, I'd be glad --

				JACK

		Frank.  Fuck it.  Okay?

				FRANK

		I've tried to do well by you, Jack.

		By both of us.

				JACK

		I'm grateful, Frank.  How much?

		For the singer.

				FRANK

		I thought maybe twenty percent.

		Look, with the additional bookings we'll

		come out ahead.  The big hotels,

		they want a pretty girl with a big voice.

		We have to stay competitive, Jack.

	Jack laughs coldly.

				FRANK

		What's that?

				JACK

		You, Frank.  All these years you been telling me

		we're different.  We got novelty, Jack.

		No one can touch us.

				FRANK

		Two pianos isn't enough anymore,

		Jack.

				JACK

		It never was.

	YOUNG WOMAN

	in pink sweater and a short black skirt stands in the

	center of a tiny room in the back of Willie's piano

	showroom, holding some sheet music.  Sammy Davis Jr.'s

	face is on the sheet music.  Frank is sitting against

	the opposite wall, a notepad in his hand.  

	Jack is at the piano.

				FRANK

		Good morning, Miss...?

				YOUNG WOMAN

		Moran.  Monica Moran.

				FRANK

		All right, Miss Moran

				MONICA (YOUNG WOMAN)

		Actually, that's my stage name.

				FRANK

		I'm sorry?

				MONICA

		Moran.  Monica.  The whole thing.  

		It's my stage name.  My real name's Blanche.

				FRANK

		Blanche.

				MONICA

		No romance, right?  That's why I came up with

		Monica. It's what I prefer.

				FRANK

		Well, that's fine --

				MONICA

		But if you call my house and my mother answers,

		ask for Blanche.  If you ask for Monica, she'll

		think you have the wrong number and hang up.

				FRANK

		Right.

				MONICA

		And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her.

		She's opposed to my career.

				FRANK

		Uh-huh.  Well, Miss Moran, what

		is it you'd like to do for us?

				MONICA

		Candy Man.'

			(worried)

		Is that all right?

				FRANK

		It's one of Jack's favorites.

	Monica turns and, seeing Jack at the piano,

	gives a little start.

				MONICA

		Oops.  I almost forgot you were

		there.  Here's the music.

	Monica begins to hand Jack the sheet music.

				FRANK

		Uh... he knows it.

				MONICA

		Really?  Isn't that a coincidence.

				JACK

		Small world.

	Monica smiles.  She likes Jack.

				FRANK

		Well, shall we?

	Probably not, but Jack begins to play anyway,

	laconically picking out the cheery tune while Monica

	swings her arms and taps her foot. Despite all this,

	Monica still manages to come in between beats and Jack

	has to scramble over a chord to catch her,

	sort of like a fireman with a net.

				MONICA

		Who can take a sunrise

		Sprinkle it with dew

		Toss it in the air and

		Make a groovy lemon pie

		The Candy Man can

		The Candy Man can...,

	There would appear to be ample evidence as to why the

	mother of Monica nee Blanche opposes her

	daughter's career.

				FRANK

		Thank you, Miss Moran, that's enough.

	Monicals eyes are closed now and she is fully caught up.

	Frank looks over at Jack.  

	Jack shrugs and continues to play.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Miss Moran ... Miss Moran ...

		Blanche!

	Monica's eyes pop open.

				MONICA

		Oh, sorry.  I get so caught up in

		it sometimes.  It's scary.

				FRANK

		Yes, it is.

				MONICA

		Well ... thanks.

			(to Jack)

		Bye.

				JACK

		Drive carefully.

	As Monica exits, Jack and Frank glance at one another

	and thus begins a seemingly endless parade of aspiring

	singers who can't sing.  As Frank sinks lower in his

	chair and Jack's ashtray spills over with wounded

	cigarettes, singer after singer, in all shapes, sizes,

	and colors, come forth to offer their own unique

	interpretations of "Feelings," "I Gotta Be Me,"

	"This Is My Song," and perhaps most appropriately,

	"What Kind of Fool Am I."

	Finally, when it is all over,

	Jack and Frank are left alone in the tiny room,

	looking dazed, exhausted, and mildly homicidal.

	TALL YOUNG WOMAN

	As the sequence ends, a TALL YOUNG WOMAN in high heels

	walks into Willie's.  She glances around,

	then spots Willie across the room,

	eating a corn beef on rye.

				WOMAN

		Hey.  You one of the fabulous

		Baker Boys?

	JACK AND FRANK

	are putting on their coats, preparing to leave.

	Frank is staring at his notepad.

				FRANK

		Thirty-seven.  Thirty-seven.

				JACK

		What?

				FRANK

		Thirty-seven girls.

		And not one who can carry a tune.

		That must be statistically impossible.

				JACK

		It was a somewhat extraordinary

		day.

				FRANK

		I just don't understand.  You

		would think someone ... anyone ...

				WOMAN (O.S.)

		Damn!

	The Woman in high heels stumbles into the doorway,

	holding a shoe in her hand.  It's broken.

				WOMAN

			(continuing)

		Brand new Thursday.  You believe

		it?

	After today, Jack and Frank are prepared

	to believe anything.

				WOMAN

			(continuing)

		This where the auditions are?

				FRANK

		This is where the auditions were.

				WOMAN

		What do you mean?

				FRANK

		We're finished.

				WOMAN

		What about me?

	Frank looks at his watch.

				FRANK

		You're an hour and a half late.

				WOMAN

		My watch is broken, too.

				FRANK

		Punctuality.  First rule of show

		business.

	The Woman looks around her.

				WOMAN

		This is show business?

				FRANK

			(in no mood)

		Look, miss.  We're tired,

		you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.

				WOMAN

			(touching her lip)

		Just like that, huh?  You're not

		even gonna give me a chance?

				FRANK

		Don't take it personally.

				WOMAN

		How should I take it?

				FRANK

		Impersonally.

	Frank begins to leave.

				WOMAN

		I don't believe it.  I come all the way down down

		here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me

		a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a

		few minutes late.

				FRANK

		You're an hour and a half late.

				WOMAN

		So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?

				FRANK

		We ran long.

				WOMAN

		So run a little longer.

				FRANK

		Miss --

				WOMAN

		You find a girl?

	Jack and Frank glance at each other.

				JACK

		No.

				WOMAN

		So. I'm here, you're here, the

		piano's here.  What d'ya say?

	Before Frank can answer, Jack walks over to the piano.

				FRANK

		Terrific.  Thirty-eight.

				WOMAN

		What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.

				JACK

		Don't worry about it.

				WOMAN

			(to Frank)

		You know, I'm feeling a lot of

		hostility from you.

				FRANK

			(appealing)

		Jack.

				JACK

		Let's get it over with.

				FRANK

		All right.  What's your name?

				WOMAN

		Susie.  Susie Diamond.

				FRANK

		Catchy.  You have any previous entertainment

		experience, Miss Diamond?

				SUSIE (WOMAN)

		Well ... for the last four years

		I've been on call to Triple A

		Escort service.

	Jack and Frank exchange a glance.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		Hey, it's legit.  Strictly dinner

		and dance.

				FRANK

		Okay.  I think that's all we

		need to know.

				SUSIE

		I sing now?

				FRANK

		That's the premise.

	Susie gives Frank a dark look, then turns to Jack.

				SUSIE

		I Get Along Without You.' Slowly,

		okay?

	Jack nods and begins to play.  

	Frank slouches down in his chair,

	preparing to be tortured again.

				SUSIE

			(continuing; singing)

		I get along without you very well

		Of course I do

		Except when soft rains fall

		And drip from leaves, then I recall

		The thrill of being

		Sheltered in your arms

		Of course I do

		But I get along without you very well.'

	Susie stops.  Frank just sits there.  

	Jack just sits there.  She can sing.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		So?

				FRANK

			(blinking)

		Uh ... we'll let you know.

	Jack looks over at Frank like he's insane.

				SUSIE

		When?

				FRANK

		When we know.

				SUSIE

			(smiling)

		Don't leave a girl hanging.

		Second rule of show business.

	Frank's not amused.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		Yeah, well, okay.  'Bye, Bakers.

	Susie walks out barefoot.

				JACK

		What are you, crazy?

				FRANK

		I just thought we should talk

		about it.  Between ourselves.

				JACK

		What's there to talk about?  She can sing.  

		That puts her at the head of the class.

		That makes her the only one in the class.

				FRANK

		I don't know ... She had gum on her lip,

		for Christ sake.  

		I don't think she's right for the act.

				JACK

			(studying him)

		You're getting cold feet about

		this.

				FRANK

		I was just thinking what Ma would

		think.

				JACK

		Ma? Ma?  Was Ma there the last time we played the

		Ambassador?  Oh, that's right, she was on bass.

		How could I forget.

	Frank frowns and looks down at his hands.

				JACK

			(continuing)

		How many other silent partners are there, Frank?

		Donna?  Little Cindy?  

		Hell, let's give Eddie a vote.

				FRANK

		Okay, okay.  I'll call the girl.

	Frank gets up wearily, then glances down at the notepad.

				JACK

		What's the matter?

				FRANK

		I didn't get her number.

	EXT.  STREET

	Jack and Frank dash out of Willie's and glance up

	and down the street.  Nothing.

				FRANK

		We can always look her up in the

		book.

		JACK.

		Right.  Susie Diamond.  She's probably listed right

		next to Monica Moran.

	Jack shakes his head in disgust.

				WOMAN (O.S.)

		Does this mean I get the job?

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Jack and Frank whirl around.

	There, standing in the doorway, is Susie.

				SUSIE

		Intuition.

	CITY SKYLINE

	Gleaming beautifully at the start of a new day.  

	Once again, "JINGLE BELLS" is heard,

	only this time carried a little further:

	"Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way..."

	JACK, FRANK AND SUSIE

	Ensconsed in the back room of Willie's, preparing

	for their first rehearsal ...

				FRANK

		Ready?

	Jack nods.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Ready?

	Susie nods.  Frank poises his hands over the piano,

	hesitates, then looks at Jack again.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Ready?

	Jack squints at Frank, then nods.  

	Frank turns to Susie.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Ready?

				SUSIE

			(looking around)

		What are we, an orchestra all of

		a sudden?

	Frank g1ares at her.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		Sorry.

	Frank poises his hands over the piano again and

	begins to play the opening passage of

	"Just the Way You Are." A moment later, Jack joins in,

	and a moment after that, Susie.  Unfortunately,

	Jack and Frank, accustomed to playing alone,

	are a tad overwhelming and the result sounds like a

	fifth grade recital.

	After a few bars, Susie holds up her hand.

				SUSIE

		Fellas, fellas ...

	Jack and Frank stop.

				FRANK

		What's the problem?

				SUSIE

		The problem is I can't hear myself

		sing with all this...

			(searching)

		... music.  You know what I'm saying?

	Jack and Frank look at one another.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		I mean, back there it may be hard to notice,

		but up here I'm having a little trouble

		getting a word in.

	Jack and Frank just stare.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		I mean, you're supposed to be

		backing me up, right?

				FRANK

			(icily)

		No. We are not supposed to be

		backing you up.

				SUSIE

		What I mean is --

				FRANK

		We're a team.  We work together.

				SUSIE

		So work with me, not against me.

		Okay?

	Frank stares at Susie for a long moment.

				FRANK

		I suppose we can bring it down a

		little.

				JACK

		I'll drop the eighths.

				FRANK

		Okay?

	Susie looks at the two brothers.

				SUSIE

		Okay.

	WILLIE'S SHOWROOM - LATER

	Frank is on Willie's telephone.  

	In the front of the store, just out of earshot,

	Jack sits at a beat-up grand,

	while Susie moves aimlessly from one piano to another.

				FRANK

		I'm telling you, Ray.  She's got

		a voice like an angel ... What?

	Frank glances furtively across the room to where Susie,

	making a very sexy silhouette against the front window,

	is running her hand over a pearl-white piano.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		No, I wouldn't say she's got a

		body like an angel.

	As Frank continues to talk in the background,

	Susie looks over at Jack.

				SUSIE

		Hey, he's not sore, is he?

				JACK

		He'll come around.

	Susie nods, goes back to stroking the piano.

				JACK

			(continuing)

		You never sang before?

				SUSIE

		Not for money. With my mother.

	Jack nods slowly, but Susie sees he doesn't understand.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		She used to waitress downtown, nights,

		when I was a kid.  On the way home, we'd sing.

		You know how people whistle when they're nervous?

		My mother sang.  She always said you're never alone

		with a song 'cause thousands of people know the

		same song and even though you can't hear 'em,

		they're singing with you.  I don't know.  

		If they were, they were all singing safe inside

		their apartments.

			(shrugging)

		But it worked.  We always got home.  Ever since,

		I always wanted to sing.  

		I never took lessons or anything, though.

		I guess you guys took a lot of lessons.

	Jack looks down at the piano in front of him.

				JACK

		Yeah.  We took a lot of lessons.

	JACK AND NINA

	Jack's tuxedo is hanging in the shower as he gets

	ready for the night's gig.  Nina, standing next to him

	at the sink, watches as he works up a lather on a bar

	of shaving soap, then paints his face with the suds.

				NINA

		You shave like an old movie, Jack.

	As Jack picks up a razor, Nina takes the brush and begins

	to soap her face in the mirror.

				JACK

		In the old days, every man had a shaving mug that

		he kept at the barber shop.  Then, whenever he

		wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop

		and there would be his mug, waiting for him.

				NINA

		Is that what you used to do?

				JACK

		My days are not the old days,

		genius.

				NINA

		What are they?

				JACK

		The recent past.

				NINA

		Oh.

			(nodding to the ceiling)

		Bigfoot gets his out of a can.

				JACK

		How do you know?

				NINA

		I saw his stuff in the bathroom.

				JACK

		Oh?

				NINA

		I guess it's getting serious.

				JACK

		Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry

		him.

				NINA

		I hope not.  He's already busted the springs

		in two chairs.  Hey, what's this?

	Nina holds up the handle of the shaving brush.

				JACK

		Ivory.

				NINA

		Looks old.

				JACK

		Older than me.

				NINA

		Wow.

	Jack gives Nina a look, then begins to splash his face.

	Nina picks up the razor.

				JACK

		Hey, what do you want to do?  Grow

		a beard?

				NINA

		Why not?

				JACK

		Well, let's get your first prom

		under the belt, okay?

				NINA

		What's a prom?

				JACK

		Ever go to church?

	Nina nods.

				JACK

		It's like that.  Only you gotta

		dance.

	INT.  HOTEL

	As Jack enters the hotel, he passes by the cardboard

	stand-up, prominently displayed in the lobby.  

	It is virtually unchanged, except for a small notation

	at the bottom: "With Guest Vocalist."

	On the other side of the lobby,

	Frank is pacing nervously.

				FRANK

		Where the hell is she?

				JACK

		It's early.

				FRANK

		I told everyone seven-fifteen.

		Didn't I? Seven-fifteen.

				JACK

		She'll get here.

				FRANK

		Just like the day of the auditions,

		right?  Jesus.  How's my hair?

				JACK

		Awe inspiring.

				FRANK

		Yeah, well, Your's isn't.

			(taking out a comb)

		Let me run a comb though it.

				JACK

		Get out of here.

				FRANK

		Come on, stand still.

				JACK

		Get out of here!

				FRANK

		It's not gonna hurt you.

				JACK

		I'll hit you, Frank.  I swear.

	Frank hesitates, like a basketball player trying to

	feint an opponent, then takes a flick at Jack's hair.

	Jack hits him.

				FRANK

			(holding his shoulder)

		You hit me.

				JACK

		I told you I was gonna hit you.

	He looks capable of hitting him again, too.

				FRANK

		All right, all right.  I'm a little

		tense.

				JACK

		You're a fucking alarm clock.

				FRANK

		I just wish she'd get here, that's

		all.

				JACK

		She's here.

	Susie, wearing a flamboyant orange dress,

	is standing across the lobby, staring at the stand-up.

				FRANK

		Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna

		wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense

		to come in the back.

			(walking over)

		Good evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late.

				SUSIE

		Where's my name?

				FRANK

		What-?

				SUSIE

		And how come you guys are the only ones with

		your pictures on the poster?

				FRANK

		We'll talk about it later.  Right

		now, you gotta get changed.

				SUSIE

		Changed?

				FRANK

		Where's your dress?

				SUSIE

			(to Jack)

		What's he talking about?

				FRANK

		Is there a language problem here?  Your dress.

		For tonight.  Where is it?

				SUSIE

		Do I look like I'm naked?

				FRANK

		That!  You can't wear that!

				SUSIE

		What's wrong with it?

				FRANK

		It's orange!

				SUSIE

			(to Jack)

		Am I missing something?

	Before Jack can reply, Frank grabs Susie's hand and

	pulls her toward the door.

				FRANK

		Come on.

				SUSIE

		Hey!

				FRANK

		Come on.  We don't have much time.

				SUSIE

		Time for what?

	INT.  DEPARTMENT STORE

	Frank, Jack and Susie dash through a cavernous

	downtown department store, the brothers turning a few

	heads with their tuxedoes.  As they reach the ladies'

	department, Frank begins to flip through the

	dress racks.

				SUSIE

		If you ask me, this is pretty

		stupid.

				FRANK

		Just look.  What do you wear?

		A nine?

				SUSIE

			(offended)

		A seven.

				FRANK

		My wife wears a seven.  You don't

		look like a seven to me.

				SUSIE

		I wear a seven.

				FRANK

		Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?

				SUSIE

			(looking)

		Save it for your wife.

				FRANK

		We're not exactly silly with time,

		you know.  Jack, you find anything?

	Jack, somewhat out of his element, is looking at belts.

				JACK

		No.

				FRANK

		Here, how's this?

	Frank holds out an inky black dress.  Susie gives it

	a long look.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Close enough.  Let's go.

	Frank begins to drag Susie into the dressing room.

				SUSIE

		Hey, pal.  I don't know about you, but where I

		come from there's a little girl's room and a

		little boy's room and the little boys don't go

		where the little girls go.

				FRANK

		All right, but make it quick.

			(remembering)

		Shoes!  What size do you wear?

				SUSIE

			(from the dressing room)

		Nine.

				FRANK

		Nine?

				SUSIE

		Nine!

				FRANK

			(to himself)

		Big feet.

	INT.  SHOE DEPARTMENT

	Frank and Jack work the shoe department,

	scouting the endless rows.

				FRANK

		See anything?

				JACK

			(holding one up)

		How about these?

				FRANK

		Jack, for crying out loud.  Your

		bachelorhood's showing.

			(seeing something)

		Ah, here we go.

	Frank grabs a pretty blue pump and gestures to the

	SALESMAN, who's waiting on a woman.

				FRANK

		Hey!  Do these come in black?

				SALESMAN

		I'll be with you in a minute, sir.

				FRANK

		I don't have a minute, pal.  Yes

		or no?

				SALESMAN

			(glowering)

		Yes.  They come in black.

				FRANK

		Okay.  Give me a pair of nines.

		Pronto.

	The Salesman looks casually at Jack.

				SALESMAN

		Does he want a pair, too?

	INT.  DRESS DEPARTMENT

	As Jack and Frank return to the dress department,

	Frank jettisons the shoebox and tissue paper.

				FRANK

		All right, we got your shoes.

	Just then, Susie steps out of the dressing room.

	Even Frank stops at the sight of her.

				SUSIE

		What do you think?

				FRANK

		Uh... good.

				SUSIE

			(turning to Jack)

		Zip me up?

	The dress is open down to the small of her back.

	It's a nice back.

	Jack takes the zipper and closes the panels carefully.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		Shoes?

				FRANK

		Right.

	Frank puts the shoes down and Susie steps into them.

				SUSIE

		They're tight.

				FRANK

		They're nines.

				SUSIE

		Well, they're aspiring to be

		sevens.

				FRANK

		You can buy new ones tomorrow.

				SUSIE

		Oh, thanks.

				FRANK

		Don't worry.  We'll take it out

		of your share.

				SUSIE

		You're a prince.

	INT.  HOTEL

	As the trio rushes into the hotel service entrance,

	RAY, the assistant manager, appears.

				RAY

		You better buy yourself a watch,

		Frankie.

				FRANK

		We had a little emergency.

				RAY

		Yeah, well, I've got a little emergency.

		You know what I'm saying?

			(seeing Susie)

		Who's this, Minnie Pearl?

	All eyes turn to Susie's dress, which still has the

	tags attached.

				FRANK

			(moving off)

		Jesus.

				RAY

		I want seventy-five minutes, Frankie.

		You hear me?

				JACK

		This is going well, isn't it?

	INT.  KITCHEN

	The three rush into the kitchen.

				FRANK

		We need scissors over here!

		Who's got scissors?

			(turning to Susie)

		Okay, remember.  Jack and I go on first,

		I do the set-up, then introduce you.

		And you say ...

				SUSIE

			(deadpan)

		Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  

		I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here.  

		It's like a dream come true.

		And speaking of dreams ...

				FRANK

		Right.

				SUSIE

		Piece of cake.

	A tiny MAN in an apron walks up with a meat cleaver.

				FRANK

		Carlos, that's,a cleaver.  I need

		scissors.

				CARLOS (MAN)

		No scissors.

				FRANK

		Jesus Christ.  All right.  Let's

		go, Jack.  Fix your tie.

	Jack and Frank exit.  

	Susie stares a little warily at Carlos and his cleaver.

	INT.  LOUNGE

	Jack and Frank slide quickly behind their pianos.  

	About half the tables in the room are filled.

				FRANK

		Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  

		Welcome to the Ambassador Lounge.  

		My name's Frank Baker and no, you're not

		seeing double, it's just my

		little brother, Jack.

	Some laughter.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		I'm glad you're all in such a good mood tonight,

		because we've got a very special

		evening planned ...

	INT.  KITCHEN

	Susie sits on a stool while Carlos positions the dress tags

	on a cutting board.  As a WAITRESS from the bar passes by,

	Susie snares a drink from her tray.

				WAITRESS

		Hey!

				SUSIE

		Just a sip.  To kill the

		butterflies, okay?

				WAITRESS

		Okay.  But no lipstick.

	Susie takes a quick sip.

				SUSIE

		There.  No one's the wiser.

				WAITRESS

		Nice dress.

	As the Waitress exits, Carlos brings the cleaver down

	with a sharp chop, severing the tags.

				SUSIE

		Appreciate it, Ace.

	LOUNGE

	The audience is laughing.

				FRANK

		But seriously, folks, as I sit here tonight,

		looking out on all your kind faces, I can't help

		but feel some of us have met before.  We may not

		know each other's names, we might not recognize

		one another on the street, but we know each other

		just the same.  And over the years we've shared

		something.  A little music, a little drink,

		a little laughter, maybe even... a few tears.  

		But I guess that's what friends are for, huh?

	Applause.  Jack puts out his cigarette.

				JACK

		Oh, brother.

				FRANK

		And it's especially nice to be among friends

		tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special

		night for my brother and I. This evening we've

		asked a young lady to join us, a lady Jack and I

		are sure will soon seem like just another old

		friend to you all.  She's making her debut here

		this evening and, as far as I'm concerned, she

		couldn't be doing it in a better place.

		Because there's one place that's always been for

		us a very special place, and that place is this

		place, the Ambassador Lounge.  Ladies and gentlemen,

		please welcome a very special lady with a very

		special way of singing a song, Miss Susie Diamond.

	Applause.  Susie strides out of the kitchen, past the

	busing station, and up to the microphone stand, which,

	unfortunately, is not on.

				FRANK

			(continuing; whispering)

		The switch.  Hit the switch.

				SUSIE

		Switch?

			(as she hits it)

		What fucking switch?

	Silence.

				SUSIE

			(continuing; very demure)

		Pardon me.

	Jack and Frank look at one another, then, before

	outrage can set in, plunge into the opening number.  

	Susie takes the mike from the stand and smiles sweetly.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		I can't tell you how thrilled I

		am to be here.

	For the moment, the audience doesn't seem quite sure

	how thrilled they are to be here.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		I'm all smiles, darling

		Through and through...'

	INT.  LOBBY

	A BELLBOY exits the elevator and, hearing Susie's voice

	coming from the lounge, stops.  

	He looks to the CLERK behind the front desk.

				BELLBOY

		I thought the Bakers were on

		tonight.

				CLERK

		They are.

				BELLBOY

		Well, who's that?

	The Clerk looks up from the register and listens.

				CLERK

		I don't know.  Frank?

	INT.  LOUNGE

	Judging from the faces, Susie's as big a hit in the

	lounge as she is in the lobby.  Head thrown back, eyes

	closed, she sings with abandon, finishing on a long

	extended note, then swooping down in a dramatic,

	exhausted bow.  There is a split second of silence,

	then thunderous applause.  Magic.

	EXT.  HOTEL

	The new trio, fresh off their first gig,

	come out of the service entrance into the night.

				FRANK

		Fucking.  She says fucking in

		front of an entire room of people.

				SUSIE

		I said I was sorry.

				FRANK

			(to Jack)

		Did you hear it?

				JACK

		Fucking.

				SUSIE

		Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais

		by the time I got out there anyway.

				FRANK

			(directly to her)

		Fucking.

				SUSIE

		For Christ sake, I said it, I

		didn't do it.

			(pulling out some bills)

		Besides, I don't think they were

		too offended, do you?

				FRANK

			(grabbing the bills)

		Give me that.

				SUSIE

		Hey!

				FRANK

		We are not a saloon act.  We do

		not take tips from dirty old men.

				SUSIE

			(innocent)

		I was gonna split it with you guys.

				FRANK

		We do not take tips.  I'll apply

		this to the cost of the dress.

	Frank puts the money in his pocket.  Susie stares at

	him, steaming.

				SUSIE

		Then I want my name on the poster.

		And my picture!

			(taking off her shoes)

		And these shoes are too goddamn tight!

	Susie hurls the shoes at Frank and stalks off barefoot.

	Jack is leaning against the wall,

	watching it all with amusement.

				JACK

		Nice girl.

	ON Frank's expression we hear the OPENING NOTES of

	"New York, New York" and we see:

	SERIES OF SHOTS

	Susie and the boys performing it in one lounge after

	another, playing to increasingly enthusiastic audiences,

	no empty tables now.

	As the SONG ends, we CLOSE ON the cardboard stand-up,

	newly done over with a picture of Susie and an

	accompanying exclamation: "See the Sensational Susie

	Diamond!" As the FINAL CHORD sounds we --

	CUT TO:

	INT.  LLOYD'S OFFICE

	Jack and Frank, once again in the office of the

	supercilious Lloyd, waiting as he prepares their

	cash envelope.

				LLOYD

		Yes, sir.  That's quite a girl you boys latched

		onto.  She a local?

				FRANK

		Born and bred.

				LLOYD

		Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys.  

		Don't spend it all in one place.  

		Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?

				FRANK

		We trust you, Lloyd.  You know

		that.

	Frank takes the envelope and begins to leave.

				LLOYD

		Say, Frankie.  Since I've got you here...

		How's next week look for you guys?

	Frank glances at Jack, giving it to him.  

	Jack's eyes go cold.

				JACK

		We'll call you.

	As Lloyd's face drops, Jack and Frank step into the

	hallway and begin to walk slowly away, playing it cool,

	then glance at one another and begin to walk faster

	because they're about to burst out laughing.

	FOLLOWING SHOT

	By the time they reach the lobby, they are laughing,

	tripping across the carpet, out the front entrance and

	onto the sidewalk, where their voices explode in the

	night air and they begin to do a weird boyish waltz

	together, laughing giddily, until they see - standing

	under an awning, lighting a cigarette - Susie, watching

	them with raised eyebrows.  Jack and Frank, frozen in a

	clumsy embrace, quickly disengage and begin clearing

	their throats and squaring their cuffs.  Susie exhales

	a plume of smoke, studies them a moment,

	then smiles slightly.

				SUSIE

		Night, Bakers.

	As she turns away, Jack glances up, watching her

	trim shadow disappear down the street.

	EXT.  CITY

	Gray and cold.  The streets swept with rain.  

	And once again the tentative piano:

	"JINGLE BELLS, jingle bells, jingle all the way.  

	Oh what fun it is to ride ...

	Oh what fun it is to ride ... Oh what fun..."

	INT.  VETERINARY CLINIC

	Jack and Eddie are sitting in the waiting room:

	small and dirty and packed with pet owners and

	their animals.

	After a moment, a WOMAN with a clipboard appears.

				WOMAN

		Barker.

			(no takers)

		Jock Barker?

				JACK

			(realizing it's him)

		Baker.  Jack Baker.

				WOMAN

		Right.  Bring him back.

				JACK

		Come on, Ed.

	Jack and Eddie follow the Woman down a corridor.

				WOMAN

		You should've brought a leash, Mr. Barker.

		The doctor doesn't like to be bitten.

				JACK

		He doesn't bite.

				WOMAN

		They never do, Mr. Barker.

				JACK

		Baker.

				WOMAN

		Right.  In there.

	The Woman points Jack and Eddie into a small room.

	There is an examining table, a sink, and on the wall,

	a chart detailing the various breeds of dogs and cats.

	Jack glances around the room, then comes back to Eddie,

	who's staring up at him.

				JACK

		You shoulda brushed, pal.

	Just then, a MAN in a white coat breezes in.

				DR. BEASLEY (MAN)

		Ah, labradorus retreiverus.  Good fellows.  

		Quiet, but able to appreciate a good joke.

	Dr. Beasley pats Eddie on the side, then turns to Jack.

				DR. BEASLEY

		Beasley.

				JACK

		Baker.

				DR. BEASLEY

		What's our friend's problem?

				JACK

		Teeth.

				DR. BEASLEY

		What's wrong with them?

				JACK

		They're falling out.

				DR. BEASLEY

		Uh-oh.  That's not good.  Let's

		get him up here.

	Jack lifts Eddie up onto the table and Dr. Beasley opens

	Eddie's mouth for a look.  It doesn't take long.

				DR. BEASLEY

		They gotta go.

				JACK

			(a take)

		How many?

				DR. BEASLEY

		Five's my guess.  Maybe more.

		Won't know till I get in there.

			(consulting his clipboard)

		Leave him now and you can pick

		him up in the morning.

				JACK

		Isn't there something you can

		give him?  A pill or something?

				DR. BEASLEY

		Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to

		the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest.

		Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that,

		would we?

				JACK

		How will he eat?

				DR. BEASLEY

		Start him out on cottage cheese.  

		If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a

		few minutes.  Go down like pudding

		through a hot pipe.

				JACK

		No bones?

				DR. BEASLEY

		No bones.

	Jack looks at Eddie.

				JACK

		What do you do to him?

				DR. BEASLEY

		Don't worry, Mr. Baker.  We'll knock him out.

		He won't feel a thing.

				JACK

		I think maybe I'll bring him back

		next week ...

				DR. BEASLEY

		The sooner we do this the better,

		Mr. Baker.

	EXT.  STREET

	Jack steps out onto the rainy street alone.

	He glances back at the vet's with second thought,

	then moves slowly off.

	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT

	Jack enters with a small grocery bag and opens the

	refrigerator.  A carton of cream, a few eggs --

	there's not much there.  He takes a small container of

	cottage cheese from the grocery bag and places it on an

	empty shelf.  As he closes the refrigerator door, he

	glances around the apartment.  It is very still, very

	quiet.  He looks up at the ceiling absently, then walks

	over to the window and looks out.  There is a mug of

	coffee there on the sill.  He takes it and holds it in

	both hands for a moment, then places it back on the sill.

	He sits at the piano and runs his fingers lightly over

	the ivory, not making a sound, then places his hands on

	the keys and begins to play.  "Jingle Bells."

	INT.  CORNER DINER

	In the front window, room has been made among the

	photographs for one of Susie.  Inside, Jack, Frank

	and Susie sit at a table, surrounded by empty coffee

	cups and cigarettes.  Frank has several slips of paper

	before him with names and dates.

				FRANK

		The twenty-third ... Yeah, here it is. We got the

		Carlton or the Plaza.  Four day turns.

		What do you think, Jack?

	Jack is staring out the window.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Jack, you with us?

				SUSIE

		The Carlton's a dump.  No cover.  No minimum.

		And they water their drinks.

		It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.

	Susie, as she says this, is pouring sugar into her Coke.

				FRANK

			(watching)

		I guess it's,the Plaza then.  

		That brings us to the twenty-seventh.  

		We got the Avedon for three or the Park

		downtown for two.

				SUSIE

		We take the Avedon, right?  Simple.

	Frank rubs his chin and looks at Jack.  Jack shakes

	his head.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		The Park?  It's only two nights.

		Why throw away a night?

				JACK

		Because Blackie Carson books the Park and

		whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.

				SUSIE

		Oh.

			(lifting her glass)

		Well, for Blackie then.

				FRANK

		By the way, I got a messsage

		yesterday from some guy looking for

		New Year's action.  Resort, upstate.

				SUSIE

			(likes "resort')

		Hey.

				JACK

		Sounds like a booking agent

		looking to book an easy fee.

				FRANK

		That's what I figure.  Probably have us in

		a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.

				SUSIE

		Maybe it's legit.

				FRANK

		Maybe.  I'll call him.

				JACK

		Make it collect.

				FRANK

			(shuffling his slips)

		That's it except for the first.

		We got the Sheraton, the Ambassador, or the

		Holiday Inn on Sixtieth.  All three-day turns.

	Frank looks at Jack.

				JACK

		Draw.

	Susie shrugs.

				SUSIE

		How'd you guys used to decide what

		gig to take?

	Jack and Frank exchange a glance.

				FRANK

		Uh, well ... we flipped a coin.

				SUSIE

		So find a dime.  Let's get out

		of here.

	EXT.  DINER

	Jack and Frank step out-of the diner and turn their

	collars up against the chill.  

	Frank pulls on a pair of gloves.

				FRANK

		Jesus, it's gonna be mean this year.  

		Where're your gloves?

	Jack shrugs.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Better take care of your fingers, little brother.  

		Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't

		be able to play 'Chopsticks.'

				JACK

		I'll take my chances.

	Frank pats his hands together and glances into the street.

				FRANK

		Something, huh?  All those bids.

				JACK

		Yeah.  Something.

				FRANK

		Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.

				JACK

		You wanna get a drink?

	Frank stops, surprised.

				FRANK

		No, I... Little Frank's got strep. Donna's been

		up two nights making sure the rest of us

		don't get it.

	Jack nods.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		You all right?

				JACK

		Yeah, fine.

				FRANK

		Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then.

				JACK

		Right.

	As Frank leaves, he takes a glance at his brother,

	then disappears around the corner.  A second later,

	Susie comes out of the diner.

				SUSIE

		Where's egghead?

				JACK

		His kid's sick.

				SUSIE

			(searching her purse)

		I don't know.  It's hard figuring you two

		as brothers.  Seems like the hospital might've

		scrambled the babies somewhere.

				JACK

		He takes after our mother.

				SUSIE

		Yeah,well, a11 I know is mother nature must be

		one crazy dame.  Shit.

	Jack offers his pack of cigarettes.

				SUSIE

		Uh-uh.  I never touch American

		cigarettes.

			(still searching)

		What's tomorrow again?

				JACK

		The Stratford.

				SUSIE

		Nice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even

		the bedspreads.

			(shaking the purse)

		Damn!  Two-fifty a pack and I go

		through 'em like toothpicks.

		Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece,

		you believe that?

				JACK

		Huh?

				SUSIE

		Paris Opals.  Twelve-and-a-half cents.  I sat

		down with a pencil and added it one day.  But

		I figure, if you're gonna be sticking something

		in your mouth, you might as well make it the best.

			(finding one)

		Ah, here's a lost soul.

	Jack lights it.  She takes a draw.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		Mmm.  Like kissing a rose.  Well,

		au revoir.

				JACK

		Hey.

			(as she stops)

		You feel like a cup of coffee?

				SUSIE

		You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in

		there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes.

				JACK

		You want me to walk you?

	Susie looks at Jack a little funny.

				SUSIE

		No. Thanks.

		She starts to move away, then stops and looks back.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are

		you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me

		and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like

		I'm some kinda princess when I burp.

		JACK

		Forget it.

				SUSIE

		I mean, that'd be too creepy.

		With us working together and all.

				JACK

		Forget it.

				SUSIE

		Nothing personal --

	Jack holds up his hand.  Susie just stands there.

				JACK

		Better hurry.  You're a nickel

		down on your cigarette.

	EXT.  VETERINARY CLINIC

	Jack paces outside the veterinary clinic, rubbing his

	arms against the night's chill.  He glances up at the

	flickering sign over the building: "Twenty-Four Hour

	Emergency Care." Inside, a KID with deep-set eyes is

	bent over a magazine.  Jack hesitates then enters.

	INT.  VETERINARY CLINIC

				KID

		Yeah?

	Jack glances around, ill at ease.

				KID

			(continuing)

		You want something, pal?  If you're looking for a

		bathroom, try the Super Chief around the corner.

	The Kid goes back to his magazine.

				JACK

		No, I, uh, left a dog here this morning.

		He needed some work on his mouth.

				KID

		Regular hours are eight to five.

				JACK

		Yeah, yeah, I know.  I was just passing by.

		Thought I'd check in on him.

				KID

		You can check in on him tomorrow.  

		Between eight and five.

				JACK

		Yeah, well, couldn't I take a

		look now?

	The Kid looks up at Jack with mild contempt.

				KID

		You want to know if he's okay.

		Right?

				JACK

			(uncomfortable)

		Yeah.

				KID

		All right.  Hold on.

				JACK

		The name's Baker --

				KID

		Save it.  What's he look like?

				JACK

			(puzzled)

		Black.  Labrador.

				KID

		All right. they lay the dead ones out in the

		cold room.  I'll take a look.

	The Kid disappears into the back.  Jack stands frozen,

	watching the swinging door come to rest.  He looks

	like a man who, unexpectedly, finds a razor pressed

	to his neck.  He fumbles for a cigarette, but doesn't

	light it.  He waits.  A moment later, the door swings

	open.

				KID

		Nope.  Just a couple poodles.

	Jack nods, then, moving stiffly, leaves.

	EXT.  VETERINARY CLINIC

	Outside, he reaches into his coat and takes the bottle.

	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT

	On the floor, a long line of bowls, each containing

	a different concoction, all intended for the ailing Eddie.

	Eddie, lying a few feet away, shows no interest.  

	In the kitchen, Jack is heating something up in a pan.

				NINA

		I tried Cheerios this morning.  

		He didn't even get up.

		Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.

				JACK

		He's just feeling sorry for himself.  This is it,

		pal.  Hear me? Two bucks a can.

	Jack dumps some brown slop into a bowl and places it next

	to the others.  Nina and he wait.  At first, nothing, then

	... Eddie's eyes move.  His nose twitches.  

	His head lifts. Finally, he gets up and walks to the

	bowl.  He eats.

				JACK

			(continuing)

		Chili.

	CITY

	draped in winter.  Dark skies, people lost in heavy

	coats, the city's battered Christmas decorations hung

	tenuously across traffic-clogged streets.  Over it all

	we hear "JINGLE BELLS," PLAYED for the first time

	completely through, hesitantly but without error.

	As the SONG ENDS, we are:

	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT

	watching Nina strike the final chord triumphantly.

	She turns to Jack, who's been listening from the couch.

				JACK

			(nodding to the ceiling)

		You're gonna knock her dead, kid.

	INT.  LUAU LOUNGE

	All done up in reds and greens for Christams Eve.

	Jack, Frank and Susie -- each decked out in their own

	little Santa hats -- perform "Silver Bells" for the

	happy crowd. Jack, smoking a cigarette, will not be

	mistaken for Santa Claus, but Susie looks adorable.

	Frank just looks happy. As they finish,

	the crowd applauds.

	INT.  BATHROOM

	Jack, now sans Santa hat, enters the bathroom off the

	lobby and finds Santa Claus standing in front of the

	mirror, fussing with his beard.

				JACK

		Hey, Frank.

				FRANK

		You recognized me.

				JACK

		Just a lucky guess.

				FRANK

		So what do you think?

				JACK

		Very realistic.

				FRANK

			(not buying it)

		Yeah, well, what can I say?  Dad must've had

		forty pounds on me.

		Jesus, you remember him being this big?

	Jack looks in the mirror.

				JACK

		Yeah.

				FRANK

		Well, the line's growing weaker, little brother.

		Lucky for us there aren't any dragons left to slay.

	INT.  LOBBY

	Jack and Frank step out into the lobby, thus giving

	a few people, Susie among them, the curious privilege

	of seeing Santa Claus exit a men's room.

				FRANK

		You want to come out to the house tomorrow?

		The way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided

		to really lay it on.  Turkey, stuffing, the

		whole bit.  Kitchen's so full of food you can

		hardly move.  We could use another appetite.

				JACK

		Thanks, but I've got plans.

				FRANK

		All right, but if you change your mind,

		let me know.  I gotta go get Ma in the

		morning anyway.

				SUSIE

			(coming up)

		Well, well.  Ho, ho, ho.  You

		moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?

				FRANK

		For the kids.

			(moving off)

		Merry Christmas, you two.  Don't

		forget.  We leave the twenty-sixth.

	Frank pushes through the revolving door and steps

	out into the street in his Santa suit.

				SUSIE

		He do that every year?

				JACK

		Every year.

				SUSIE

		Aren't the kids asleep?

				JACK

		Every year.

				SUSIE

		So why's he do it?

				JACK

		I guess in case one year they're not.

	Jack looks into Susie's eyes, then crosses to the

	door and exits.  Susie watches him go, then turns to

	the desk clerk.

				SUSIE

		Call me a cab, will ya?

	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT

	As Jack enters his apartment, he senses a presence in

	the room and looks over to the old phone booth.  

	Nina is sitting inside on the little stool, her head

	tilted against the glass.  Jack studies her a moment,

	then takes the carton of eggnog he's carrying into the

	kitchen and grabs a pair of glasses.  He pulls a chair

	over to the phone booth and sits down.

				NINA

		How'd the show go?

				JACK

		Okay.  How'd yours go?

				NINA

		Not so good.

	Jack looks at Nina's face, tender and young in the

	soft shadows of the booth.  After a moment, her eyes

	shift to the carton in his hand.

				NINA

		Eggnog?

	Jack nods.

				NINA

			(continuing)

		From Hurley's?

				JACK

		Eighty proof. What d'ya say?

		Think you can handle it?

	Nina nods. Jack begins to fill the two glasses.

				NINA

		Jack.

				JACK

		Yeah?

				NINA

		Can I stay here tonight?  Even if

		she comes here?

	Jack pauses a moment, then closes the carton and sets

	it aside.

				JACK

		Sure.

		He hands Nina her glass, then takes his own.

				NINA

		Merry Christmas, Jack.

				JACK

		Merry Christmas.

	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT - NEXT MORNING

	Jack and Nina are standing in the middle of the room,

	looking down at something.

				NINA

		What do you think?

	Eddie, outfitted in a brand new, spanking red dog

	sweater, stares up at Jack and Nina, wondering why

	he's the object of so much attention.

				JACK

		Very cool.

	EXT. CEMETERY - JACK, NINA AND EDDIE

	(sporting his new sweater)

	make their way across an empty cemetery.

	Nina is swinging a bottle of whiskey.

				NINA

			(looking around)

		There were more flowers last year.  Mr. Rinaldi

		down at the drugstore says it's going to snow

		by New Year's.  Says he can feel it in his elbows.

		I hope it snows.  I want to make a snowman.

		You ever make a snowman, Jack?

				JACK

		Sure.

				NINA

		That's what I want to do.  

		I want to make a snowman.

	As they come to a plot of ground, they stop.  

	There are two matching headstones, one for Jack's father,

	fully engraved, and another for Jack's mother, bearing

	only her name.  Jack studies the plot a moment, then

	crouches before his father's marker: "ANDREW S. BAKER.

	Adoring Husband of Eleanor, Loving Father of Franklin

	and John." Jack brushes some dirt from the face of the

	stone, then stands.

				NINA

			(continuing)

		Now?

	Jack nods.  Nina uncaps the whiskey bottle and pours

	it onto the dead man's grave.

				NINA

			(continuing)

		Merry Christmas, Mr. Baker.

	They stand another moment, just looking, then turn away.

	As they begin to walk, Jack sees Eddie in his new

	sweater sniffing at a gravestone.

				JACK

		Hey, Eddie.  Have some respect,

		will ya?

	EXT.  BUILDING

	Jack is sitting on a suitcase in front of his building.

	A moment later, Frank pulls the car up to the curb and

	Jack gets in.  Susie is sitting up front.

	INT.  CAR

	Frank, burning with the afterglow of a holiday spent

	with family, cheerfully maneuvers the car

	through the city.

				FRANK

		So. How was everyone's Christmas?

	Jack and Susie stare disconsolately out the window.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Too early, huh?  Well, there's coffee and donuts

		for whoever wants them.  

		How about a maple bar, Jack?

	Jack shakes his head and takes out a cigarette.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Uh, Jack ... if you don't mind.

	Jack stares at the back of Frank's head,

	then puts the cigarette away. Susie takes a peek in

	the donut bag and looks a little sick.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		By the way, if anyone gets bored,

		Donna packed some travel games.

		They work wonders with the kids.

	Frank reaches under the seat and hands Susie a sack

	full of magnetic games, puzzles, and plastic cubes.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		You two could play checkers.

				SUSIE

		Maybe we should just listen to the radio.

				FRANK

		Sorry.  It only plays static.

	Susie looks at the radio,

	then at the games in her hands.

				SUSIE

		How long did you say it takes to

		get to this place?

	INT. CAR - FEW HOURS LATER

	Jack is staring out the window at the winter landscape,

	an unlit cigarette dangling from his lip.  

	Susie is gnawing on a donut, deeply obsessed with an

	elaborate plastic puzzle.

				FRANK

		Any more coffee?

	Susie snaps out of her trance and shakes the Thermos.

				SUSIE

		Uh-uh.  Hey, what's this?

	Susie notices an old, leather-bound ledger.  Inside,

	there are hundreds of tiny entries.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		You play all these places?

				FRANK

		Baker's unabridged.

				SUSIE

		Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of

		noise.  What's with the stars?

				FRANK

		Virgins.

				SUSIE

		Virgins?

				FRANK

		First times. Hey, look at this.

	A crepe-covered car surrounded by several other

	HONKING VEHICLES passes by.  Jack stares at the beaming

	newlyweds as they glide past his window,

	two kids starting life in a beat-up Eldorado

	covered with toilet paper.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		When's the last time we played a

		wedding, Jack?

				JACK

		Two years ago.  March.

				SUSIE

			(consulting the ledger)

		He's right.

				FRANK

		He's always right.  Go ahead.  Pick a virgin.

	Susie looks at Frank curiously.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Go ahead.

				SUSIE

			(scanning the book)

		Okay.The Fantasy Inn.

				FRANK

		Jack?

				JACK

			(staring out the window)

		November.  '71.

				FRANK

		First night?

				JACK

		Day.  Wednesday.

				FRANK

		Last?

				JACK

		Sunday.

				SUSIE

		I don't believe it.

				FRANK

		I told you, he's got the gift.  Same with music.

		Hears it once and he's got it.

		Frank smiles into the rear view mirror.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		My brilliant little brother.

	EXT.  HOTEL

	The hotel, done in a sort of King Arthur motif,is

	built right on the ocean.  Frank guides the car down

	a simulated cobblestone drive and the three get out.

				FRANK

		Will you listen to that ocean?

	It's LOUD.  Frank takes a deep breath.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		And how about this air? I'm telling you,

		a few days in this place'll put five years

		on your life.

				SUSIE

		Smells like fish.

				FRANK

		Of course it smells like fish.  

		We're on the ocean.

		What'd you expect, Chanel number five?

				SUSIE

			(to herself)

		Smells like tuna number two to me.

				FRANK

		It's paradise.  That's what it is.

		Paradise.

	As Susie and Jack follow Frank up the drive, Jack

	notices the beat-up Eldorado in the parking lot,

	its toilet paper streamers blowing

	gently in the ocean breeze.

	INT.  HOTEL LOBBY

	The lobby is done in royal reds and blues and there

	are a lot of swords on the walls.

	Franks steps up to the front desk.

				FRANK

		Hi, we're the Fabulous Baker Boys.

				CLERK

		Glad to meet you.  I'm Terrific

		Tom.

				FRANK

		No. We're the entertainment.

				TOM (CLERK)

		Oh, right, gotcha.  You got bags?

				FRANK

		Outside.  Blue Chevy.

				TOM

			(ringing a bell)

		Cyril.  Chevy.  Blue.  Take 'em up

		to the Guinevere Suite.

	A lanky boy in velvet jodhpurs and high stockings ambles

	out for the bags.  Tom hands Frank the room keys.

				TOM

			(continuing)

		Right on the ocean, Mr. Baker.

		You can practically dangle your toes

		in the water.

	INT.  SUITE

	Tom wasn't kidding.  The immediacy of the ocean beyond

	the window is almost scary.

				FRANK

		You believe this?  I'm telling you, we're getting

		away with murder.  Two shows a night and the rest

		of the time we live like kings.  It's a crime.

	Jack stares at the ocean, then at the two beds placed

	side by side.  Suddenly Susie comes through the bathroom.

				SUSIE

		Hey, we're connected.

				FRANK

		Great.

				SUSIE

		Great?

				FRANK

		Yeah.

	Susie shrugs and returns to her room through the

	bathroom.

				JACK

		I thought we had separate rooms.

				FRANK

			(opening drawers)

		We do.  She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey.

		Wash and Dries.

				JACK

		I thought we all had separate rooms.

				FRANK

		Come on, Jack.  It's not like it's the first

		time we've bunked together.  It'll be like when

		we were kids.  Relax.  Enjoy the view.

	INT.  DINING ROOM

	Jack, Frank and Susie are in the dining room, which,

	like their rooms, looks out over the ocean.  

	Dinner is over and they're well

	through a second bottle of wine.

				SUSIE

		You're kidding me.

				FRANK

		As Charlie Steinway is my witness.

				SUSIE

		Peggy Lee?

				FRANK

		Tell her.

				JACK

		She was staying at the Grand

		downtown ...

				FRANK

		It was April.  April seventeenth.

		That one I remember.

				JACK

		We were playing the lounge one

		night and she came in.

				FRANK

		Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.

				JACK

		Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said

		yes, and we did a few bars.

				FRANK

		A few bars!

				SUSIE

		What'd she sing?

				FRANK

		People.' You think Streisand, right?  

		Hot that night.  Chills.  

		Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.

				SUSIE

		Wow. You ever see her again?

				FRANK

		No. We got a picture, though.  

		One of the waitresses had a camera.

			(to Jack)

		God, we were just kids.  That was

		something, wasn't it?

	Jack nods.  Frank shakes his head, still lost in the

	spring evening years before, then notices the newlyweds

	sitting across the room.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Hey, will you look at that?

				SUSIE

		They must've bought the same

		map we did.

				FRANK

		What do you say we send a bottle

		over?

				SUSIE

		I don't believe it.  You're a

		romantic, Frank.

				JACK

		He's drunk.

				FRANK

		Not true.  Besides, Jack's the romantic.

				SUSIE

		Oh yeah?

				FRANK

		He's just afraid to show it.

		Aren't you, little brother?

				JACK

		Have some more wine, Frank.

				FRANK

		Good idea.

			(lifting his glass)

		To Peggy Lee.

	INT.  BATHROOM

	Frank, standing, dressed in pajamas.

	Jack is staring out the window at the darkness.

				FRANK

		I'm putting my stuff on the right,

		okay?

				JACK

		Okay.

				FRANK

		I figure that way we won't get confused.

				JACK

		Right.

				FRANK

		Unless you want the right.

				JACK

		No, you take the right.

				FRANK

		We might as well do the towels the same way.

				JACK

		Okay.

				FRANK

		I just figure things'll go smoother, you know,

		if we have it all worked out from the beginning.

				JACK

		Good idea.

				FRANK

		But if it doesn't work out, let

		me know.  I'm,flexible.

				JACK

		Right.

	Frank nods and moves to the bed.

				JACK

			(continuing; re: the bathroom light)

		You leaving that on?

				FRANK

		Yeah.

				JACK

		All night?

				FRANK

		Yeah.

				JACK

		We're gonna be here a week?

				FRANK

			(puzzled)

		Yeah.

				JACK

		So you're gonna leave it on.

		Every night.  For a week.

				FRANK

		Yeah.  You mind?

				JACK

		Why would I mind?

				FRANK

		I don't know.  I mean, I always did it as a kid.

		I figured it was no big deal.  Is it?  A big deal?

	Jack just stares at Frank.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Oh. I didn't know.  I mean, I always did it as a kid.

		It was never a big deal then.  Was it?

	Jack just stares at Frank.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Oh. Well.  You want me to turn

		it off?

	Jack just stares at Frank.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		I'll turn it off.

	Jack turns back to the window.

				JACK

		Forget it.  It's no big deal.

	INT.  DINING ROOM - DAY

	The next morning.  Jack and Frank are standing

	in a huge dining room, appraising two elegant grands.

				FRANK

		They're beauties, huh?

	Jack steps up to one and runs his hand over the keys.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Reminds me of those Steinways Willie used to have.

	Frank taps a few notes on his piano, humming happily.

	Jack begins to echo his brother's notes, listening.

	After a moment, Frank notices.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		What?

	INT.  DINING ROOM

	A short, stubby LITTLE MAN in a charcoal suit strides

	into the dining room, followed by Terrific Tom.

				MR. DANIELS (LITTLE MAN)

		Good morning, gentlemen.  I'm Mr. Daniels,

		the manager.  I believe I've spoken to one of you

		on the phone.

				FRANK

			(offering his hand)

		That'd be me, sir.  Frank Baker.  

		This is my brother Jack.

	Jack, slouched against the piano, smoking, nods.

				MR. DANIELS

		Tom here tells me there's a problem with the

		pianos.  We were assured they were in tune.

				FRANK

		Yes, well, they are.

				MR. DANIELS

		Then I'm afraid I don't understand.

				FRANK

		They are in tune.  But not with

		each other.

				MR. DANIELS

		Is that important?

				FRANK

		Uh, well ...

				JACK

		Yes.  It's important.

	Frank glances nervously at Jack.

				MR. DANIELS

		Tom, who're we dealing with on

		these?

				TOM

		A Mr. Reynolds, sir.  But he's gone on vacation.

		I called this morning.

				MR. DANIELS

		Well, gentlemen, I don't know what to say.  

		Not being a musician myself I find it difficult

		to grasp the magnitude of this.  I don't suppose

		there's any way you could just ... accommodate.

				JACK

		Accommodate?  I don't think I know

		what you mean.

				FRANK

		I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say,

		Jack, is --

				JACK

		Why don't we let Mr. Daniels tell

		us what he's trying to say.

				MR. DANIELS

		I assure you, Mr. Baker, no offense is intended.

		I simply mean, well, we're not a symphony, are we?

	INT.  HALLWAY

	Frank dogs Jack down a hallway.

				FRANK

		Jack ... Jack ... You're acting like

		a kid.

				JACK

		No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around

		one of these assholes and you turn into a

		fucking three-year-old.

				FRANK

		What's the matter with you?  So the piano's a

		little out of tune.  So what?

				JACK

			(stopping)

		Christ, can't you hear it?

				FRANK

		No! I never hear it!

			(shaking his head)

		Maybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know.

		But I won't let it bother me.

				JACK

		Doesn't it matter to you?

				FRANK

		What matters to me is we've got the six easiest

		nights we've had in ten years.  

		So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat.  

		So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody.

		So why should you care?

				JACK

		Because I can hear it.

				FRANK

		Well, then stuff cotton in your ears, because

		come six o'clock we're gonna walk into that

		dining room with smiles on.

		Understand, little brother?

	INT.  HOTEL ROOM

	Frank is adjusting his tie in the bathroom mirror.

	Jack, sitting at the window, his foot up against the

	glass, drinks from a flask as the sky above the ocean

	goes dark.  After a moment, Susie enters wearing a

	little tuxedo of her own and begins to brush her hair.

				SUSIE

		Hey, fellas.  What's the word?

	Nothing.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		What's with you two?

				FRANK

		Jack woke up on the wrong side

		of the bottle.

	Susie looks at Jack.  Then Frank.

				SUSIE

		0-kay.

	INT.  LOUNGE

	As Jack, Frank and Susie perform "Strangers in the Night,"

	dozens of couples move slowly on the dance floor,

	while others sit at candle-lit tables, sipping cocktails.

	As the song ends, the couples applaud.

				FRANK

		Thank you, thank you.

			(as applause dies)

		You know, Susie and Jack and I only just arrived

		here yesterday, but already the people here at the

		King Corporation's Moorish Manor have made us feel,

		well, a part of the family. And it's their hope that,

		before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part

		of that family also.  So, if during-the next few days,

		we should happen to pass one another in the hallway

		or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger.

		Stop.  Say hello.  Introduce yourself.  Because here,

		there are no strangers, only friends.  

		And family.  Right, Jack?

				JACK

		Right.  I love you, Frank.

				FRANK

			(stunned)

		What?

				JACK

		I love you.  I just wanted to say it.

	Frank stares incredulously at Jack.

				FRANK

		Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack.

			(moving quickly along)

		So. Susie.  How 'bout it.

				SUSIE

		Huh?

				FRANK

		Got another song for us?

				SUSIE

		Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.

				FRANK

		Well then ... shall we?

	BACKSTAGE

	Frank corners Jack as they exit the stage.

	Susie looks around nervously to see if anyone's watching.

				FRANK

			(whispering)

		What's the matter with you?

				JACK

		I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family.

		I just got emotional.

				FRANK

		How dare you say you love me.

				JACK

		It won't happen again.  Scout's

		honor.

				SUSIE

		What's with you guys?

				FRANK

		Someone needs to grow up.  I won't

		take it, Jack.

				JACK

		Sure you will.

	Jack pushes past Frank and leaves.  

	Frank watches him go, then turns to leave himself.

	INT.  BATHROOM

	Middle of the night.  Jack, fully clothed,

	is sitting on the rim of the tub, smoking.

	Susie enters.

				SUSIE

		Oh, sorry.  With the light always

		on, it's hard to tell.

				JACK

		It's okay.

			(the cigarette)

		Last one.

				SUSIE

		Can't sleep?

				JACK

		In and out.

				SUSIE

		It's the waves.  God's music, my mother used to say.

		She was crazy for the ocean.

				JACK

		Yeah, well, I wish God would go

		a little easy on the trumpets.

				SUSIE

		How's egghead?

				JACK

		Like a baby. You?

				SUSIE

		In and out.

	Jack nods.  Susie looks at him carefully.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		If you want, I got a pack in the

		room.

				JACK

		No thanks.  I never touch French

		cigarettes.

	INT.  LOBBY - DAY

	The next morning.  As Jack passes through the lobby,

	he hears the plaintive PLINKING of a PIANO.  Curious,

	he goes to the dining room and peers in.  

	The tables have yet to be set for the evening and,

	except for Frank, the room is empty.

				JACK

		What the hell are you doing?

				FRANK

			(not looking up)

		What's it look like I'm doing?

		I'm tuning a goddamn piano.

				JACK

		Really.

				FRANK

		Yes, really.  I don't want you to be unhappy,

		Jack.  If you say it's out of tune,

		it's out of tune.

	Jack smiles to himself and crosses the room.

				JACK

		How's it coming?

				FRANK

		Fine.

				JACK

		How long you been at it?

				FRANK

			(shrugging)

		Half-hour.  Once I finish this octave I'm gonna

		get breakfast.  You see what's on the buffet?

				JACK

		They stopped serving two hours ago.

				FRANK

		Two hours ago!

				JACK

		Time flies, huh?

	Frank looks despairingly at the pianos.

				JACK

			(continuing)

		I could give you a hand.  If

		you want.

	INT.  DINING ROOM - DAY

	Jack and Frank are eating lunch.  Frank has a tiny

	stack of blue cards he's perusing.  

	He holds one out to Jack.

				FRANK

		What do you make that?  Paruchi?

	Jack nods.  Frank continues to go through the cards

	as he speaks.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		You haven't seen Susie, have you?

				JACK

		No. Why?

				FRANK

		Just wonder what she's up to.

		I never see her.  Makes me nervous.

				JACK

		She's a big girl.

				FRANK

		Yeah, well, she's our girl now.  I think we better

		keep an eye on her.  There's trouble there.

			(another card)

		Hey, listen to this.  Ethel and Bert Lane.  

		Married seventy-five years.  You believe that?

				JACK

		What the hell are these?

				FRANK

		Dedications.  I came up with the idea on the road.

		See, every morning the maids drop one of these

		cards in each room.  The guest fills out the card,

		leaves it at the front desk, and that night we play

		it.  Daniels went crazy for the idea.

			(whispering)

		And that's not all.  Last night, after the nine

		o'clock, he corners me, right, and starts asking

		about our availability.  Like he wants to line

		something up.

		I think he's got a hard-on for Susie.

				WOMAN

		Excuse me.

	Frank jumps.  A WOMAN in a bright flowered gift shop

	dress pokes her head in.

				WOMAN

		I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting

		here, I just had to come over.  Florence Simmons.

				FRANK

		Uh ... Frank Baker.  This is my

		brother.

				FLORENCE SIMMONS (WOMAN)

		Oh, I know, I know.  My husband and I saw you

		play last night and it's the most remarkable thing.

				FRANK

		Oh. Well, thank you.

				FLORENCE SIMMONS

		No, I mean you.

			(to Jack)

		I have a brother-in-law who looks exactly like you.

		Exactly.  You don't happen to have a Huckleberry

		in your family tree, do you?

				JACK

		Afraid not.

				FLORENCE SIMMONS

		Well, it's frightening.  You could be his twin.

		Of course, he doesn't have your talent.  Musically,

		I mean.  He sharpens things for a living.  Lawn

		mower blades, kitchen knives, anything with an edge.

		Can imagine?

	Jack is having a hard time imagining Florence Simmons.

				FLORENCE SIMMONS

			(continuing)

		Well, anyway, I just had to make sure there was

		no relation.  You play wonderfully.  Both of you.

	Florence Simmons gives a little flutter of

	a wave and exits.

				FRANK

		Funny, huh?

				JACK

		What?

				FRANK

		Thinking there's someone who looks like you,

		walking around the street somewhere.

			(smiling)

		Wonder if I saw him I'd think it

		was you?

	EXT.  HOTEL - DAY

	Jack is standing on the walkway that encircles the

	hotel, watching the waves tumble into one another.  

	As he starts to take out a cigarette, he notices

	Florence Simmons standing a few yards away

	with a camera.

				FLORENCE SIMMONS

		I just know my sister won't believe

		me. Do you mind?

	Jack shakes his head and Florence starts to aim the

	camera.

				FLORENCE SIMMONS

		I really hate to impose.  It's just that the

		resemblance is so extraordinary.

			(focusing)

		I wonder if you could turn this way so your face

		isn't in the shadows.

	As Jack turns, he glances over Florence's swaying

	shoulder and sees Susie and a man standing at the other

	end of the walkway.  They are leaning into the wind,

	her hair blowing free, brushing the man's face.

				FLORENCE SIMMONS

		Say cheese.

	The camera clicks.

				FLORENCE SIMMONS

			(continuing)

		Gotcha.  Would you like a copy for

		yourself?  The hotel develops.

	Jack glances away from Susie and the man.

				JACK

		No.

	ON Jack's expression APPLAUSE is heard and a moment

	later we --

	CUT TO:

	INT.  DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	That evening.  The trio has just finished a song and

	those on the dance floor are clapping.

				FRANK

		Thank you.  You know, before we came out here

		this evening, Susie and Jack and I were looking

		over your dedications and something struck us.

	Susie and Jack look at Frank as if they have no idea

	what he's talking about.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		We realized that, well, we're really not so

		different from one another after all.  Oh sure,

		we may be at different points in our journey,

		but we all travel pretty much the same road.

		And so, with that in mind, we'd like to introduce

		you to two very special couples.  First, married

		for all of two days, please say hello to Helen

		and Bud Wilson.  Helen.  Bud.

	Those standing on the dance floor applaud as the young

	couple from the beat-up Eldorado make their way to the

	front of the room.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		And now, our second couple.  I'm talking about

		Ethel and Bert Lane, ladies and gentlemen.  Now,

		Ethel and Bert would be upset with me if I told

		you they'd been married for fifty years.  Why?

		Because, ladies and gentlemen, Ethel and Bert Lane

		have been married for seventy-five years!

	The audience lets go with an audible "ooh"

	and applauds enthusiastically.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Ethel, Bert.  Get up here and

		show these kids how it's done.

	A path is cleared and a tiny couple begins to make

	their way to the dance floor.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Aren't they a sight?

	They are indeed, and a sight slower getting to the

	dance floor than Frank anticipated.

	He nods to Jack and they launch into "The Anniversary

	Waltz," but have to keep repeating the opening passage

	while they wait for Ethel and Bert.  Finally, everyone

	on the dance floor steps back and, with some help from

	a few waiters, who slide a section of tables out of the

	way, Ethel and Bert Lane begin to dance in the center

	of the room, slowly but wonderfully, while the younger

	couple whirls around them like a youthful satellite.

	INT.  BATHROOM

	Jack is sitting in the bathroom again, smoking.  He

	hears Susie's door open, then VOICES -- hers and a

	man's.  He puts out his cigarette in the

	sink and leaves.

	INT.  HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY

	The next morning.  Frank, the early bird, is

	returning to the room with a newspaper under his arm.

	Whistling happily, he rounds the corner just in time to

	see a man exit Susie's room.  Astonished, then outraged,

	he goes to Susie's door and knocks sharply.

				SUSIE

			(opening door)

		Forget your tie, handsome ...

		Frank!

				FRANK

		You want to tell me what the

		hell's going on?

				SUSIE

		Huh?

				FRANK

		I just saw a man walk out of

		your room.

				SUSIE

		Uh ...

				FRANK

		In case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be

		here.  So it might be nice if you conducted

		yourself with a certain amount of decency.

				SUSIE

		Decency?  Hey listen, pal ...

				FRANK

		No. You listen.  I had my doubts

		about you from the beginning

				JACK

		Hey!

	Frank and Susie turn.  Jack is standing in the hallway.

				JACK

			(continuing)

		What're you trying to do?  Wake

		up the whole goddamn hotel?

				FRANK

		We were just having a little

		discussion about morality.

				SUSIE

		Some discussion.

				FRANK

		I just saw a man walk out of your

		room!

				JACK

		You saw wrong.

				FRANK

		Huh?

				JACK

		He's with the hotel.  I called him.

				FRANK

		What are you talking about?

				JACK

		We had a leak in the bathroom.

		He fixed it.

				FRANK

		He was wearing a suit.

				JACK

		He had to come quickly.  It was

		a big leak.

				FRANK

		How come I didn't hear anything?

				JACK

		You're a heavy sleeper, Frank.

		You've always-been a heavy sleeper.

			(looking at Susie)

		Unlike me.

	Frank looks at Jack, then Susie.

				FRANK

		I guess I ... If I jumped to...

				SUSIE

		Forget it.

	The three stand there awkwardly for a moment.

				FRANK

		Well...

	Frank shrugs lamely and exits.

				SUSIE

		Boy, he comes on like a hurricane

		in the morning, doesn't he?

	Jack just stares at her.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		Yeah, well, thanks for sticking

		your head in.

				JACK

		Hey, business is business.

	He turns to leave.  Susie's eyes narrow.

				SUSIE

		It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.

				JACK

		Just dinner and dance, right?

	INT.  DINING ROOM

	Jack, Frank and Susie are sitting at a table in the

	smaller dining room.  It is conspicuously quiet.  

	The main course seems to be a conscious attempt to

	ignore each other.  Finally, Susie looks at Frank.  

	Then Jack.  Then out the window.

				SUSIE

		Paradise.

	INT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	Jack and Frank's room.  It is New Year's Eve,

	just before show time, and Jack and Frank are in

	their tuxes.  Frank is on the phone.

				FRANK

			(into phone)

		Yes, Daddy promises.  I'll bring you one of the

		little glasses, how's that?  Just like Grandma has.  

		It has a picture of the hotel on it and everything

		... No, honey, they don't sell puppies here ...

		Who? ... Well, we'll see.  Let me talk to Mommy,

		okay?... Okay,sweetheart.  Happy New Year.

			(waits)

		Hi, honey.  She says Angela Secoli got a puppy for

		Christmas.  Explain to her why we can't ... I don't

		know, tell her you're allergic ... It's not lying.

		Well, okay, it is lying, but ... All right, then tell

		her I'll explain it ... He what? ... No kidding?

		Without the training wheels?

			(affected by this)

		Well, that's great.  Tell him, tell him. I can't wait

		to see ... No, no new bike.  Maybe for his birthday ...

		Okay.  Listen, honey, I have to go.We're on in ten

		minutes ... Yeah, Happy New Year ... I love you ...

	Frank sets the phone down and stares at it.  

	Jack studies him a moment, then Frank suddenly

	claps his hands.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Well, let's go.  The public waits.

	INT.  DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	A mass of swarming, jubilant people.  The voices are

	high and loud and there's not a hand without a

	champagne glass.  Couples lean into one another

	intimately, dancing gaily between the tables, toasting

	strangers without hesitation.

				FRANK

			(yelling to be heard)

		All right, everyone.  This is it.

		Let's hear it.  Ten.  Nine ...

	Gradually, the entire room joins the chant.

				FRANK/EVERYONE

		Eight.  Seven.  Six.  Five.

		Four.  Three.  Two!  ONE!

		HAPPY NEW YEAR!

	There is a blizzard of confetti as people scramble to

	find that certain someone to kiss in the new year.  

	In this moment, Jack, Frank and Susie find themselves

	oddly removed from the frantic cheer below them,

	their presence suddenly unnecessary, forgotten.  

	Finally, Susie walks over to Frank and gives him a kiss,

	then goes to Jack.  They hesitate, then kiss lightly,

	pulling away and glancing awkwardly into each other's

	eyes.  Frank sounds the first chord of "Auld Lang Syne"

	and Susie looks away from Jack and returns to her place

	on the stage.  As she begins to sing, the others in the

	room, all intimate friends for one brief moment,

	begin to sing with her.

				SUSIE/EVERYONE

		Lest old acquaintances be forgot ...

	As the voices slowly fade, they are joined by the

	sound of the OCEAN until the ocean is all we hear

	and we see:

	INT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	Jack, lying on his bed in the dark.  He opens his eyes,

	squinting against the light from the bathroom, then

	glances over to Frank's bed and detects the outline

	of a body in the darkness.  Swinging his legs over the

	side, he sits up on the edge of the bed and rubs his eyes.

	Suddenly there is a rustle of blankets and the shadow in

	the next bed shifts, falling into the shaft of light cast

	from the bathroom.  It is a little boy.  Startled, Jack

	stares at the sleeping boy, then hears movement in the

	bathroom.  Rising slowly, he walks to the bathroom and

	gently eases the door open a few inches.  Inside, swimming

	murkily in the steamy mirror, is the reflection of a man.  

	His back is to Jack, but Jack can see that the man is

	shaving.  As Jack lets his gaze drop to the floor, he sees

	that water is dripping off the man's pant cuffs and

	gathering in pools on the bathroom floor ... Jack wakes

	up.  He stares at the ceiling, listening to the waves,

	then lifts his head and looks to the bathroom.  It is

	dark. Turning, he glances at Frank's bed.  It's empty.

	INT.  DINING ROOM

	Dark and soundless.  Balloons, streamers and the other

	debris of revelry cover the tables and floor like snow.  

	Frank is sitting at the window, drinking as he stares at

	the ocean.  As Jack crosses the room, he looks up.

				FRANK

		Ah, well, if it isn't the lad with the golden ear.

		Happy New Year, little brother.

				JACK

		What're you doing down here?

				FRANK

		Celebrating.  Join me?

				JACK

		The party's over.

				FRANK

		No, you're wrong.  It's just beginning.

		Come on, have a drink.  

		Show your big brother how it's done.

	Frank pours him a glass.  Jack notices the bottle.

				JACK

		Expensive hangover.

				FRANK

		A gift.  Courtesy of our courteous

		hotel manager, Mr. Daniels.

			(toasting Jack)

		We, dear brother, are a fucking

		smash.

			(nodding)

		Yup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they

		have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids.

		Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with

		Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais

		and everyone has a grand time crawling around on

		the front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a

		dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in

		a different colored shell and at the end of the

		evening they crack themselves open.  It's our job

		to separate the yolks from the whites.

		Slippery business.

	Frank smiles as he takes a swallow of his drink, then

	leans his head back, staring at the ceiling.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		You know, I've never kissed my wife on New Year's.

		Not once in twelve years.

	Jack studies Frank as he stares at the ceiling.

				FRANK

		The Holmby has a chandelier like that doesn't it?

		With the blue glass.

	Jack looks up at the chandelier.

				JACK

		The Royal.

				FRANK

		Right.  The Royal.  When's the

		last time we were there?

				JACK

		Couple years.

				FRANK

		February?

				JACK

		April.

				FRANK

		Right.  It's incredible how you

		do that.  Remember things.

				JACK

		A useless talent.

				FRANK

		Drove me crazy when we were kids.

		The way you never looked at the music.

		Miss Simpson would just play it and ...

	Frank snaps his fingers.

				JACK

		They were simple songs.

				FRANK

		Not for me.  I still have to look at the music

		sometimes, you know that?  Otherwise, I forget.

		I just forget.  But you.  You never forget.

		Ever.

			(turning)

		So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?

				JACK

		I told you.  It's a useless talent.

	Frank studies Jack a moment, then stares out at the

	ocean.

				FRANK

		God, the old man would've loved

		this view, wouldn't he?

				JACK

		Yeah.

				FRANK

		I always think of him on New Year's.  

		How he used to pour us each half a can of beer.

		Remember?

				JACK

		You always threw up.

				FRANK

		Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice.

		He loved that about you.

				JACK

		He was just having fun.

				FRANK

		It was like you'd passed some test,

		you know?

				JACK

		It was just a can of beer, Frank.

				FRANK

		Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me

		anything.  Even though I was the oldest.  

		It was always you two, running off, doing things

		together.

				JACK

		You could've come.

				FRANK

		I could've.  But he didn't want

		me to.

				JACK

		You're making things up, Frank.

				FRANK

		Maybe so.

			(pause)

		You ever go back there?  Where it

		happened.

	Jack stares at the angry SEA, LOUD even through the

	thick glass.

				JACK

		No.

	EXT.  HOTEL - DAY

	The next morning.  Jack is sitting outside the hotel,

	watching HELEN and BUD WILSON pack up the Eldorado.  

	The streamers, by now turned to mush, cling like oatmeal

	to the car's exterior.  After a moment, Frank exits with

	a little bag from the gift shop and pulls out a

	tiny souvenir shot glass.

				FRANK

		Want one?

	Jack shakes his head.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Ah well, the kids'll break a

		couple anyway.

	Suddenly, across the parking lot, the voices of the

	newlyweds are heard.

				BUD

		Give me the keys.

				HELEN

		You're not going to drive.

				BUD

		Give me the keys!

				HELEN

		You're not going to drive!

				BUD

		It's my goddamn car!

				HELEN

		It's our goddamn car!

				BUD

		Give me the keys.

				HELEN

		No.

	Bud hesitates, then makes a rush for his wife, but

	she's too quick and runs to the other side of the car.

	Frustrated, he begins to run around the car like a

	madman, trying to catch her.  Finally, when he gets

	close, she darts off, sprinting across the parking lot.

				FRANK

		I think I'll warm up the car.

	OVERVIEW - CITY

	Cold, dark, dangerous, but somehow looking quite

	appealing after a week in paradise.

	INT. CAR - NIGHT

	The trio, looking road-weary, is parked in front

	of Jack's building.  It is very late.

				FRANK

		That takes care of this week.  The tenth we

		got the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're

		at the Capri.

				JACK

		The tenth's out.

				FRANK

		What?

				JACK

		I can't make the tenth.

				FRANK

		What do you mean?

				JACK

		I mean maybe you should check with us before you

		go off and book us a month in advance.

				FRANK

		Be reasonable, Jack.

				JACK

		I play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank.

		How much more reasonable you expect me to be?

	Jack gets out of the car.  Frank shakes his head in

	exasperation, then looks to Susie.

				FRANK

		How about you?  Got a Bar Mitzvah

		this weekend?

				SUSIE

			(distracted)

		Huh?

				FRANK

		Forget it.

	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT

	Jack lets himself in and closes the door quietly.

	In the darkness he can make out Nina and Eddie,

	curled up on the couch, asleep.  Above them,

	hung carefully on a string, are some paper letters:

	"WELCOME HOME."

	INT.  LOUNGE

	In a lounge whols basic decor makes abundant use of

	several historical eras but which might best be described

	as Modern Pilgrim, Jack, Susie and Frank perform

	"Feelings," while waiters in huge Paul Revere hats pass

	in and out of view.

				SUSIE

		Feelings ... Wo wo wo ... Feelings

		... Wo wo wo ... Feelings ...

	KITCHEN

	Jack, Frank and Susie exit the lounge to applause.

				SUSIE

		I can't sing it anymore.

				FRANK

		What?

				SUSIE

		That song.  I can't sing it anymore.

		I'm gonna get sick.

				FRANK

		What're you talking about?  They

		love it.

				SUSIE

		I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it.  

		Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?

				FRANK

			(as to a child)

		Susie.  It's one more show.  One

		more time.  That's all.

				SUSIE

		And two more times tomorrow night, and two more

		times the next night, and the next night and the

		next night and the next night.  Frank, I can't

		sing that fucking song anymore!

	She's yelling.  The kitchen workers are glancing over.

	Jack studies her as she tries to calm herself.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		I need some air.

	EXT.  HOTEL

	A few minutes later.  Jack comes out of the hotel and

	sees Susie pacing.  

	He sits down and watches her for a moment.

				JACK

		You're gonna wear down those

		heels if you don't give it a rest.

		She stops.

				JACK

			(continuing)

		Relax.  We'll drop the song.

				SUSIE

		Guess I got a little scattered.

				JACK

		It's a shitty  song.

	Susie nods and looks up at the glittering hotel.

				SUSIE

		How do you do it? Every night?

				JACK

		Practice.

			(pause)

		There are worse songs, you know.

		Not many, but a few.

	Susie nods.  Jack studies her.  Something's on her

	mind.

				SUSIE

		Listen...

			(looks into his eyes)

		Nothing.

	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT - DUSK

	A record is spinning on Jack's phonograph as the sun

	goes down outside his window.  As we MOVE AWAY FROM

	the phonograph and PAST the window, we FIND Jack at

	the piano, playing along with the record,

	lost in concentration.

	EXT.  BUILDING - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Susie is working on a Paris Opal, pacing, occasionally

	glancing up at Jack's apartment, where the MUSIC can be

	heard FAINTLY.  After a moment, she drops her cigarette

	on the sidewalk.  There are half a dozen others

	already there.

	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT

	The record finishes, but the needle doesn't pick up,

	bumping into the label.  Jack glances at the clock next

	to him and gets up.  He puts on a jacket, then takes a

	pair of gloves and pulls them on carefully.

	EXT.  BUILDING

	As Jack comes out of his building, Susie stops pacing,

	surprised.  Jack, wearing the same look of concentration

	he had at the piano, doesn't see her and turns down the

	other end of the street.  Susie starts to call after

	him, but stops.

	EXT.  JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT

	The sun is gone now and the moon is in the sky.  

	We see the hot neon exterior of a tiny jazz club.

	INT.  CLUB - NIGHT

	Jack is sitting in the shadows near the stage, where

	a trio is playing.  He has a drink in front of him,

	but it is untouched.  After a moment, the trio finishes

	and the pianist, a huge black man named HENRY, nods to

	the applause.

				HENRY

		Thank you.  As most of you know, we like to shake

		things up here every so often just to keep you

		people on your toes.  So I'm gonna take a little

		rest, grab myself a drink, and let an old friend sit

		in.  He drops by about once a year just to keep

		his hands clean.  Ladies and gentlemen.  

		Jack Baker.

	Jack rises to polite applause and shakes Henry's hand.  

	As he settles behind the piano, he sits for a moment,

	not moving, then nods to the two men behind him.  As they

	begin to play, we recognize the music from the record.  

	Jack waits, then brings his hands to the keys.  As he

	plays, his face is suddenly calm.  Peaceful.

	EXT.  CLUB - NIGHT

	Later.  Jack comes out of the club and into the night,

	lighting a cigarette as he moves up the street.

				SUSIE (O.S.)

		You were good.

	Jack stops.  Susie.

				JACK

		I can keep the beat.

				SUSIE

		Better than that.

	Jack's face goes a little cold, but he says nothing,

	beginning to walk again.

				SUSIE

		What's the matter?

				JACK

		Nothing.

				SUSIE

		What'd I say?

				JACK

		Nothing.

				SUSIE

		You're upset.

				JACK

		I'm not upset.

				SUSIE

		All I said was you were good.

				JACK

			(stops)

		Look. You don't know good. All right?

				SUSIE

		What's that supposed to mean?

				JACK

		It means you wouldn't know good

		if it came up and fucked you.

				SUSIE

		You were good.

				JACK

		Let's make a deal.  You shut up.

				SUSIE

		You were good.

				JACK

			(exasperated)

		How do you know?

				SUSIE

			(yelling)

		Because I saw the other people!

		And they knew you were good!

		You were good, goddamnit!

	Jack studies Susie, then glances off.  For a moment,

	they just stand on the corner, not talking.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		So you wanna get a drink?

	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT

				JACK

		Nina?

				SUSIE

		Who's Nina?

				JACK

		Friend.

				SUSIE

		Friend?  What's she look like?

		Maybe I can help you find her.

				JACK

		She's four feet tall.  Ed?

				SUSIE

		Ed? How many people live here?

	Eddie walks around the couch and looks curiously at

	Susie.  Jack moves to the kitchen.

				JACK

		I have to make him some chili.

		Okay?

				SUSIE

			(a look)

		Sure.

	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT - LATER

	Light from a weak lamp, lots of shadows, as romantic

	as Jack's apartment will ever get.  Outside the window,

	the city looks like a thousand jewels, gleaming.

	Susie cradles a drink in her hand as she moves slowly

	about the room, slipping, in and out of the shadows as

	if they were veils.

				SUSIE

			(at window)

		Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it.  

		When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before

		the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a

		wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights

		of the city and string them into-a necklace for

		myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her

		eyes, I don't know, it was like she really

		believed it.

				JACK

		How come you didn't close your eyes?

	She looks surprised by the question.

				SUSIE

		I don't know.  I guess I didn't

		trust the night like she did.

	Susie finishes her drink and sets it down.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		Let me have a cigarette, will you?  

		All of mine are down there on the sidewalk.

	Jack looks at her curiously.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		Long story.

	Jack gives her an American cigarette and lights it.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		You know, I saw you guys once.

		You and Frank.  At the Roosevelt.

				JACK

		Must've been a cheap date.

				SUSIE

		Soap convention.

				JACK

		Soap?

				SUSIE

		Yeah, they got a convention for everything. At

		least he was clean.  Boy, the guys I met when I

		was with the service, you wouldn't believe.  The

		older ones, they were okay.  Nice.  Polite.  Pulled

		the chair out for you.  But the younger ones ...

			(shaking her head)

		Mama used to say, dance with a man once, but if you

		can feel calluses on his fingers, don't dance with

		him again.  She thought she had it all figured out.  

		But she wasn't so smart.  There are killers with

		palms like a baby.

	Susie takes a long draw and blows the smoke out slowly.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		It wasn't so bad, though.  I'd get a nice piece of

		steak, flowers, sometimes even a gift.  Usually

		whatever the guy was into.  Got a socket set once.  

		Believe it?  The guy looked like held just given me

		four dozen roses.

			(almost wistful)

		But I stayed at the Hartford once.  You should see

		the rooms.  All satin and velvet.  And the bed.  

		Royal blue, trimmed in lace clean as snow.  Hard to

		believe sleeping in a room like that don't change

		your life.  But it don't.  The bed may be magic, but

		the mirror isn't.  You wake up the same old Susie.

			(pause)

		I didn't always, you know.  If I liked the guy ...

	Susie looks at Jack, but he just takes a drink.  She

	looks out the window again.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		Sometimes I wish the sun would never come up.

	She stares at the lights another moment, then turns and

	nods to the phone booth.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		So what's this?

	Jack frowns, takes another drink.

				JACK

		History.

				SUSIE

		Huh?

				JACK

		My father proposed to my mother

		in there.

				SUSIE

		No kidding?

	It's a small phone booth.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		The both of them?  In there?

				JACK

		He called her.

				SUSIE

		Oh. So what's it doing here?

				JACK

		Long story.

				SUSIE

		You sending me home?

	Jack locks eyes with Susie, then glances away.

				JACK

		They'd been out dancing all night and he took

		her to the train station -- she lived over in

		Brookhaven.  Usually held ride with her, but this

		time he didn't.  Anyway, he starts walking home,

		only as he's walking he starts getting nervous.

				SUSIE

		Nervous?

				JACK

		By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's

		got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the

		rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading

		about it in the morning edition.

				SUSIE

		You're kidding.

				JACK

		He had a mind that escalated things.

				SUSIE

		So, what happened?

				JACK

		He calls her, asks her to marry him, she thinks

		he's crazy, he asks her again, she still thinks

		he's crazy but says yes anyway, and the next thing

		you know he's got his brothers down there and

		they're tearing the thing right off the curb.

	Susie blinks.

				JACK

			(continuing)

		I don't know.  Maybe he thought some rich guy was

		gonna try and call her.

				SUSIE

		Wow.  But I still don't see how ...

				JACK

		Ma didn't want it around.  After.

				SUSIE

		Oh.

	Jack glances out the window.

				SUSIE

			(continuing, carefully)

		Frank said you saw him die.

	Jack glances up quickly, surprised.  He nods.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		Frank said ---

				JACK

		Frank wasn't 'there.

	Susie stops, looks down.  Jack studies her for a moment,

	then decides.

				JACK

		He took me out to the docks one day.  We did that a

		lot.  There were other places, but he loved the ocean.

		He'd worked boats as a kid.  Never got rid of it.

		It was always in him.  He'd drink a little when we'd

		go.  If he drank enough, he'd do this funny Irish jig.

		To make me laugh.

			(pause)

		He drank a lot that day.

	Susie studies Jack as he stares into his glass.

				JACK

			(continuing)

		There was a lot of wind.  He was up on this cargo

		shelf, right over the ocean.  And he started to

		do the jig.  One minute he was there ...

			(shrugs)

		I thought it was a joke at first.

		He did things like that.  Games.

			(pause)

		I was laughing when it happened.

	Jack stares at the glass in his hands, then glances

	up and catches Susie looking at him.

				JACK

		You got pretty eyes, you know that.

	INT.  JACK'S BEDROOM

	Jack's bed.  In the darkness, we see Susie's profile,

	her eyes looking up toward the ceiling.  Jack's body

	falls slowly across her and he kisses her neck.

	EXT.  JACK'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

	We see Eddie, wearing his Christmas sweater,

	sleeping on the fire escape.

	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Susie is dressed, sitting at the piano, staring out the

	window as she absently hits a key.  She is smoking one

	of Jack's cigarettes.  Distracted.  Jack comes to the

	doorway and watches her.  Plink.  Plink.  Plink.

				JACK

		You gotta move 'em around if you want to

		play a song.

	Susie starts, looks at her hand on the piano,

	pulls it away.

				SUSIE

		Oh. Hi.  Sorry.

				JACK

		Coffee?

				SUSIE

		Yeah... No.

				JACK

		Look, if you want to leave...

				SUSIE

		Yeah, maybe ... No. God, I hate these cigarettes!

	Susie throws the cigarette out the window,

	then looks down.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		Shit.  I think I started a fire.

				JACK

		If our feet get hot, you grab

		the piano.

	Susie smiles weakly.

				JACK

			(continuing)

		Why don't you go.  I'll see you

		tomorrow night at the Ambassador.

	Susie doesn't move.

				SUSIE

		I followed you last night.  I

		mean, I was here.  Outside.  I was

		about to come up when you came out.

	Jack waits.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		The reason I came by ... I couldn't tell Frank...

		I'm leaving.  The act.

	Susie stares up at Jack, but he says nothing.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		It's a ... I met this guy at the resort.  He liked

		my voice.  And, it's ... He thinks I can sell cat

		food just by singing about it.  Can you believe it?

	Susie tries a laugh.  Jack nods.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		You can always get another girl.

				JACK

			(looks out window)

		There's always another girl.

	INT.  LOUNGE

	Jack and Frank stand in a lounge, talking to NICK, the

	manager.  Busboys move in and out, preparing the room

	for the evening.

				NICK

		Sick?  How sick?

				FRANK

		The flu.

				NICK

		So she's got a few sniffles.

				FRANK

		Doctor's orders.

	Nick frowns, looking at the two pianos across the room.

				NICK

		You got no right springing this on me, Frankie.  

		It's unethical.

				FRANK

		Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.

				NICK

		What am I gonna do?  Put a record

		player out there?

			(exiting)

		Bad, Frankie.  Bad.

				JACK

			(to Frank)

		What're you doing?

				FRANK

		Just until we find another girl.

				JACK

		Cancel, Frank.

				FRANK

		You want to know how much I got tied up in

		deposits with Willie?  We're in for three

		weeks solid, Jack.

				JACK

		Better give her pneumonia.

	INT.  BACK ROOM

	Jack and Frank find themselves in the back room of

	Willie's again.  They do not look happy.

				GIRL (O.S.)

		Remember me?

	Jack and Frank look up.  A girl in a yellow and black

	dress is in the doorway.  She looks like a bumblebee.

				GIRL

		Monica.  Monica Moran.  I came in the last time

		you guys were looking for a singer.

			(smiling)

		Perseverance.  First rule of show business.

	Jack and Frank just stare at her.

				MONICA (GIRL)

		I bought a book.  That's what it says.

	EXT.  WILLIE'S - LATER

	Frank is looking at a list.

				FRANK

		We got the Roosevelt on Thursday, the Park in a

		couple of weeks.  Larry Shelton said he'd let me

		know by Friday on the Ambassador.  That's it.

	Frank folds the paper carefully.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		I got some calls out.  Things

		that might be good for us.

	Frank looks over at Jack for the first time.  He's

	leaning against the building, staring at his shoes.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		We'll try for a girl again next

		week.

	Jack nods.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Okay.  Well, the Roosevelt then.

	INT.  ROOSEVELT HOTEL - LOUNGE

	Once grand, now dark and dusty looking.  A small crowd.

				FRANK

		You know, my brother and I have been playing

		together, gosh, I don't know.  Jack?

				JACK

		Twenty-eight years.

	No response.  Bored, brutally indifferent faces.

				FRANK

		Of course, uh, back then it was, uh, a little

		different.  We were just kids.  Just about the

		only one who would listen to us was the family

		cat, Cecil.  We must've shaved three lives off old

		Cecil, huh, Jack?

	Frank laughs and his voice, eerily magnified by the

	microphone, is the only sound in the room.

				FRANK

			(continuing; hanging tough)

		Yeah, well, anyway.  It's nice to be back here in

		the Roosevelt Room, because this has always

		been ...

	Frank falters as he sees Mrs. Baker enter the lounge and

	seat herself at a table in the back of the room.

	Jack follows Frank's eyes and spots her.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		a very special place for Jack and I.

			(recovering)

		And tonight we'd like to open with a very special

		song.  It's the song my mother and father danced 

		to the night they were married.  This is for them.

	INT.  LOBBY

	Jack watches as Frank gives Mrs. Baker a hug.

				FRANK

		You should've told us you were coming, Ma.  

		We would've come and got you.

				MRS.  BAKER

		Spur of the moment.

				FRANK

		So what'd you think?

				MRS.  BAKER

		Thrilling.

			(glancing at Jack)

		Both of you.

				FRANK

		The audience was a little off

		tonight.

				MRS.  BAKER

		A few empty tables.  It's cozier.  

		Besides, Mel Torme couldn't fill this place

		on a Wednesday night.

				FRANK

		I guess you're,right.  Well, what do you say we

		get a little midnight snack?  

		Theo's should still be open.

				MRS.  BAKER

		No, no.  You boys are tired.

				FRANK

		No, we're not.  Jack?

				JACK

		No.

				MRS.  BAKER

		I'm tired.  Really.  I should get

		home.

				FRANK

		You sure?

				MRS.  BAKER

			(nodding)

		Just call me a cab.

				FRANK

		A cab?  Ma, come on.  My car's just a half

		block down.  You wait here.

				MRS.  BAKER

			(smiling)

		All right.

	Frank dashes out of the lobby.  Jack and Mrs. Baker

	watch him go, then turn to each other.  Mrs. Baker smiles

	awkwardly, then surveys the lobby.

				MRS.  BAKER

			(continuing)

		It's beautiful, isn't it?

	The brocade on the walls has faded and the chairs -

	once covered with velvet, now with a cheap imitation -

	look old and dowdy, but the room still maintains an

	elegant dignity.

				JACK

		Yeah.

				MRS.  BAKER

		This was quite,a place once.  After the war.  On

		Friday nights they had dances in the ballroom

		upstairs.  It was beautiful.  Crystal chandeliers.

		White tablecloths.  Orchids floating in the punch

		bowls... It was a wonderful place to be young.

	Jack watches his mother as her eyes pass over the room.

	After a moment, she nods toward the lounge.

				MRS.  BAKER

			(continuing)

		It went well tonight.

				JACK

		Frank works hard.

				MRS.  BAKER

		And you don't?

				JACK

		He leads, I follow.

				MRS.  BAKER

		Is that the way it is?

				JACK

		Pretty much.

				MRS.  BAKER

		He mentioned you had a girl for

		a while.  A singer.

				JACK

		For a while.  She left.

				MRS.  BAKER

		Yes, well, it's probably best.

		No sense bringing someone else in.

				JACK

		I suppose.

	Mrs. Baker glances into the lounge, at the two pianos.

				MRS.  BAKER

		Funny.  Watching tonight, I was

		remembering when you were young.

		How I used to stand in the kitchen, listening to

		the two of you practice while I did the dishes.

			(smiling)

		My two little radios.  Sometimes I'd stop and go to

		the door and just watch.  Sometimes your father

		would too.

			(pause)

		He liked to listen to you play.

		Did you know that?

	Jack shakes his head.

				MRS.  BAKER

			(continuing)

		You miss him, don't you?

				JACK

		It's been a long time, Ma.

				MRS.  BAKER

		Yes.

			(pause)

		I supposed you still have that old phone booth.

	Jack nods.  Mrs. Baker smiles, then it fades.

				MRS.  BAKER

			(continuing)

		His love scared me, you know.  The day he died he

		 left a flower on my pillow.

	Jack looks puzzled.  Suddenly his mother reaches out

	and very gently touches her fingers to his face.

				MRS.  BAKER

			(continuing)

		You look so like him.

	They stand like this for a moment, connnected, then

	Frank steps in from the street.

				FRANK

		Your limo's ready, Ma.

				MRS.  BAKER

		All right.

	Mrs. Baker takes her hand from Jack's face and turns

	away.  Just before she exits, she looks back.

				MRS.  BAKER

			(continuing)

		Good night, Jack.

	EXT.  STREET

	Jack, walking home, turns a corner and suddenly stops.

	Across the street, talking to a man, is Susie.  She says

	a few words to the man, then touches him lightly on the

	arm and begins to walk away.  Jack watches her retreat,

	then follows, moving quicker as he draws close.  As he

	reaches her, he gently touches her elbow and she turns.

	Not Susie.  The woman stares at Jack, startled.  

	For a moment, he doesn't move.  Finally, he lets go of

	her elbow.

				JACK

		Sorry.

	INT.  CAR - NIGHT

	A few nights later.  Frank guides the car through wet

	city streets.  It's two AM and raining hard.

				JACK

		We're not getting paid then.

				FRANK

		No.

				JACK

		Nothing. We get nothing.

				FRANK

		I told you, Jack.  It's a telethon.

		No one gets a cent.

				JACK

			(a pause)

		What's it for?

				FRANK

		I don't know. Some disease.

				JACK

		What disease?

				FRANK

		I don't know.

				JACK

		You don't know?

				FRANK

		It's a disease, Jack.  We're against it.

		It's not a moral decision.

				JACK

			(another pause)

		What channels it on?

				FRANK

		Seventy-one

				JACK

		Seventy-one?  What's seventy-one?

				FRANK

			(defensive)

		A channel.  

		It's just a little further down the dial, that's all.

		Look, it's publicity.  Publicity's publicity.  Right?

	Jack stares at Frank.

				JACK

		Right.

	INT.  HALLWAY

	Jack and Frank make their way down a hallway.

				FRANK

		The guy said to find Studio E and

		turn right.  What's that say?

	Suddenly, a rapid-fire THUMPING SOUND resounds through

	the corridor.  As Jack and Frank turn, they see a huge

	YOUTH in a wheelchair dribbling a basketball toward them.

				YOUTH

		Fast break!

	Jack and Frank step back and watch the kid one-wheel it

	around the corner.

				FRANK

		I guess it's that way.

	INT.  STUDIO

	Jerry Lewis need not fear.  This is strictly a tin foil

	and crepe paper operation. Along one wall is the "phone

	bank," monitored by a few sleepy volunteers, and opposite,

	in makeshift bleachers, is the audience.  A huge tote board,

	set on rolling astors, is next to the phones.  The total,

	at 2:15 AM, is $1125.38. As Jack and Frank enter, the kid

	in the wheelchair is doing basketball tricks before the

	camera.

				FRANK

		This must be it.  I'll see when

		we're on.

	Frank leaves. Jack glances around the studio like he's

	walked into a nightmare.  At the phone bank, a heavyset

	MAN in a sweatshirt and a cap, looks over.  Both the

	sweatshirt and the cap have "Earl" printed on them.

				EARL (MAN)

		You the magician?

				JACK

		No.

				EARL

			(disappointed)

		Oh.  What do you do?

	Jack points to the pianos across the room.

				JACK

		Piano.

				EARL

			(hopeful)

		Two at a time?

				JACK

		My brother and I. One each.

				EARL

			(disappointed again)

		Oh.

				JACK

			(indicating the kid in the wheelchair)

		What's wrong with the kid?

				EARL

		Knee.  Tore it up against St. Anthony's.  Right

		before the accident.

				JACK

		Accident?

				EARL

		The fire.  The way we're going we'll be lucky to

		buy a carton of jockstraps, let alone a new gym.

		As Jack registers this, Earl's PHONE RINGS.  Frank

		returns and gestures to the kid in the wheelchair.

				FRANK

		We're on after Meadowlark.

			(seeing Jack's face)

		What's wrong?

				JACK

		Are you kidding me?  Are you

		fucking kidding me?

				FRANK

		What?

				JACK

		We're playing for a goddamn

		gymnasium!

				FRANK

			(worried)

		What?

	Before Jack can further enlighten Frank, the kid in the

	wheelchair rolls off and a guy in a cheap rented tux

	strides in front of the camera.  He's VINCE NANCY,

	the host.

				VINCE

		Let's hear it for our own Jimmy

		Marshall, shall we?

	The audience applauds.

				VINCE

			(continuing)

		As most of you'know, young Jimmy put a nasty twist

		on that knee trying to win-one for good ol' Grant

		High this year.  Luckily, the doctors tell us

		Jimmy'll be able to play next season.  That is ...

		if there is a next season.

			(Uncle Sam)

		That's where you come in.  Pick up that phone.  

		Make a donation.  Let's keep our kids off the

		streets and in the gym where they belong.

	Applause.

				VINCE

			(continuing)

		All right.  Well, friends, what can I say about

		our next guest?

			(consulting a card)

		He, uh, they, uh, we are very pleased to have with

		us two of the most respected men in the musical

		entertainment field.  I think you'll agree with me

		when I tell you we're in for a real treat when I

		say that we have with us ... the Fabulous Bunker

		Boys!  Come on out here guys.

	Vince gestures grandly to the left and Jack and

	Frank enter from the right.

				VINCE

			(continuing)

		Whoops, there they are.  Hey, nice

		suits, fellas.

			(to camera)

		Now I know a lot of you amateur musicians out

		there are going to want to rap with these guys and

		don't worry.  Right after they finish up here,

		they're going to be manning the phones.  Maybe we

		can even convince them to raffle off a few piano

		lessons if we're lucky.  What do you think?

	The audience applauds.  Jack glares at Frank.  He shrugs.

				VINCE

			(continuing)

		Well, all right then.  What are we

		waiting for?  Take it away, guys.

	Jack and Frank poise their hands over their pianos and

	begin to play.  As the music rises, the studio becomes

	very quiet, almost still.  Unfortunately, Jack and Frank

	are barely through the opening passage when a thunderously

	LOUD BELL begins to RING.  Suddenly, Vince steps out

	again.

				VINCE

			(continuing)

		Uh oh.  We know what that means, don't we?  It's

		time to turn the board over.

			(to Jack, Frank)

		I'm afraid you fellas'll just have to wait a minute.  

		Let's bring out the board.

	Two post-pubescent giants roll out the tote board

	right in front of Jack and Frank.  

	Jack looks positively homicidal.

				FRANK

		Jack ...

	Jack kicks out the piano bench and starts to leave.  

	Then, seeing the kid in the wheelchair, he grabs the

	basketball and fires it at Vince.

				VINCE

		What the --

				JACK

			(pointing)

		You're a fucking creep, you know

		that.  I oughta kick your ass.

				FRANK

			(whispering)

		Jack, you're on television.

				JACK

		Shut up, Frank.

	Earl of the sweatshirt and cap puts his hand on

	Jack's shoulder.

				EARL

		What do you say we go for a walk,

		pal.

				JACK

		Get your hand off me.

				EARL

		Come on, friend.  I can smell it on you.  

		Get yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget

		what you're angry about.

				JACK

		Go fuck yourself.

				EARL

			(eyes go hard)

		You're a real tough guy when the

		ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?

				JACK

		I don't see any ladies here.

		Except maybe you.

	That does it.  Earl takes hold of Jack's collar and

	starts to-wrestle him roughly toward the door.

				FRANK

		Hey, leave him alone.

				EARL

		Do your brother a favor and have his mouth sewn up.

				JACK

		You're a lousy dancer, Earl.  Don't

		you know the man's supposed to lead?

	Earl shoves Jack into the hallway, hard.  

	Jack stumbles back against the wall.

				EARL

		Who do you think you are, asshole?

		Liberace?

	EXT.  STREET

	Jack walks down the street, mindless of the rain.  

	Frank follows a few yards behind.

				FRANK

		Jack.  We just,passed the car. Jack.  This is a

		tuxedo.  Three hundred dollars.

			(pause)

		You gonna talk to me?  Or is this Jack's famous

		silent act?  Look, it was for publicity.  

		Do you understand?  Publicity.

	Jack stops and stares at Frank incredulously.

				JACK

		What-are you?  A fucking moron?

		It's three o'clock in the morning,

		Frank.  Who's watching?  Your wife?

		Maybe you can get us a gig playing

		Little Frank's birthday party.

		What do you think?

				FRANK

		Look.  I didn't know when we were going to be on

		until yesterday.  What was I supposed to do?  

		I had the pianos anyway.

				JACK

		Basketballs, Frank.  You had us

		playing for basketballs.

				FRANK

		I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed

		up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle

		of a gig.

				JACK

			(incredulous)

		What?

				FRANK

		It wasn't professional, Jack.  It was a stunt.  

		A stupid-ass stunt.

	Jack just stares at Frank, as if looking at a stranger.

				JACK

		What's happening to you, Frank?  You been kissing

		ass so long you're starting to like it?  You let

		that guy turn us into clowns tonight.  We were

		always small time, but we were never clowns, Frank.  

		What's happened to your dignity?

				FRANK

		Dignity?  Who the hell are you to

		talk about dignity?

	Frank suddenly steps forward and reaches into Jack's

	jacket, coming away with a bottle.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		This where you get your dignity, Jack?  

		This is where you get your courage?

	Jack tries to grab the bottle but Frank holds it away.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		No, let's do it straight for

		once, shall we?

	Frank tosses the BOTTLE into the street, where it

	SHATTERS.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Let me explain something to you, little brother.  

		See, I've got people who depend on me.  I've got

		a wife and two children who expect to wake up every

		morning with food on the table and heat in the house.  

		I got a mortgage.  I got car payments.  I got Ma's

		medical bills. Oh yeah, and I got you.  Yeah, you.  

		Jack the shadow who's so cool and so hip and so

		fucking sure he's better than everyone else.  Don't

		you think I'd like to walk up to one of these assholes

		and blow smoke in his face?  Goddamn right I would.  

		But I can't.  Because I have to be responsible, little

		brother.  I have to make sure the numbers balance out

		in my favor at the end of each month so everyone can go

		on living their lives.  You don't win medals for it,

		but you can be damn sure you'd all take notice if I

		folded up shop.  So don't talk to me about dignity,

		little brother.  You're drawing on a weak hand.

	Jack stares at Frank through the rain,

	then turns and begins to walk away.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Great.  Terrific.  Walk away.  You're good at that,

		Jack.  Just don't forget to stop off for another

		bottle of courage on your way home.

			(pause)

		That's what he'd do.

	Jack stops, his back to Frank.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		You've found the perfect solution to all the

		pain in the world, haven't you, little brother?  

		Eight-fifty a bottle, available any time day or

		night at your friendly neighborhood liquor store.  

		You're weak, Jack.  Just like he was.

	Jack turns, tough and dangerous in the darkness.

				JACK

		Stay off it.

				FRANK

		No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of

		watching you make him up into some kinda god.  

		For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid

		bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He

		wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.

				JACK

			(eerily cold)

		You weren't there.

				FRANK

		That's right.  I wasn't there.  I don't have the

		luxury of being a witness to tragedy.

				JACK

			(coiled)

		Fuck you.

				FRANK

		No, fuck you.  And fuck him too.

		Fuck the both-of you.

	Jack suddenly bolts for,ward and grabs Frank by the

	lapels.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Hey, what're you doing?  Hey!

	Jack flings Frank against the wall, pounding, pulling

	and slamming him in a fitful rage.

				FRANK

			(continuing; scared)

		Jack! ... Jack! ...

	Frank slides to the ground, afraid, trying to protect

	himself.  Jack hovers over him.

				JACK

		How's it feel to have your little brother beat

		the shit out of you?  Huh?  Huh!

	Jack comes down with a vicious fist at Frank's face.  

	Frank holds up his hands, trying to shield himself,

	and catches a blow on his fingers.

				FRANK

		My hands!  My hands!

	Jack grabs one of Frank's hands.

				JACK

			(mocking)

		Your hands.  Your hands couldn't take the blue

		ribbon on amateur night.

	Jack bends back Frank's fingers.

				FRANK

			(terrified)

		Jack!

				JACK

		Who's weak now, big brother?

	Jack pushes Frank's fingers until the knuckles crack.

				FRANK

		Jack!  JACK!

	Frank's voice echoes high above the sound of the rain.  

	Suddenly Jack stops.  Looking at Frank's hand, still

	clasped in his, he seems as shocked by his own behavior

	as Frank.  Letting go, he steps back awkwardly and looks

	at his brother, beaten, to the ground, his tuxedo ripped

	and dirty.  He stares at his own hands, the knuckles split

	and bleeding.  He no longer looks dangerous.  He looks

	hollow, frightened.

				JACK

		I'm through with it.  I can't do

		it anymore.

	Frank, rubbing his fingers, glances up at Jack, but Jack

	just turns away, leaving Frank on the sidewalk, and

	disappears into the rain.  MUSIC begins.  A sad, plaintive

	solo piano.  And we see:

	SERIES OF SHOTS

	Jack, crossing the street to his apartment, the rain

	over now.

	Frank, driving home, his face swollen and bruised in the

	dim glow of the streetlights.

	Jack, letting himself into his apartment and standing

	there.  Alone.

	Frank, easing the car into the driveway, turning off

	the engine.

	Jack, taking a bottle from the kitchen, moving numbly.

	Frank, much later, still sitting in the driveway as

	the sun begins to come up.

	Jack, sitting in the phone booth, the bottle in his hand.

	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY

	The next morning.  Jack is sitting on the windowsill,

	watching the RAIN DRUM the GLASS.  He glances at the phone

	across the room, takes another look at the rain, then goes

	to the phone.  He picks it up hesitantly, then dials.  

	It rings.  Again.  Again.

				CINDY (V.0.)

		Hello?

	Jack blinks.  It's Cindy.

				CINDY

		Hello ... Hellooooo ...

			(fainter)

		Daddy.  Daddy!  Someone's on the

		phone and they won't talk.

	Jack sets the phone back down on the cradle.

	INT.  BAR

	Jack stands in a dark bar.  It is early morning and the

	light from the street gives the room a ghostly atmosphere.  

	A big, beefy MAN with a bar towel hooked in his belt is

	talking to Jack.

				MAN

		If they wanna talk about their wife, you listen.  

		If they wanna talk about their job, you listen.  

		If they wanna talk about their parakeet, you listen.  

		That's it, six nights a week, nine to one or until I

		send you home.  Okay?

	Jack nods and points to the piano in the corner.

				JACK

		That it?

				MAN

		How many you need?

	Jack walks over to the giano and strikes a note.

				JACK

		It's out of tune.

				MAN

		Trust me, the way I fix a martini,

		it'll be in tune.

	The MUSIC RETURNS, sad and plaintive, and we see:

	INT.  FRANK'S HOUSE

	Frank, attempting to give piano lessons to a brother

	and sister tandem who would be better served by an

	obedience school.  While the little girl pounds

	incessantly on the piano, her brother runs circles

	around the room, destroying everything in sight.

	MUSIC CONTINUES and we see:

	EXT.  STREET

	Jack and Eddie, going for a walk, passing the diner

	where Jack and Frank's pictures are still displayed.

	MUSIC CONTINUES and we see:

	INT.  BAR

	Jack, in the bar, playing the music we've been hearing

	throughout the previous scenes.  It is after midnight

	and the tables are empty.  Only a few somber men remain

	at the bar.  They do not appear to be music lovers.  

	As Jack finishes, he takes a cloth and wipes the keys.  

	There is a glass on the piano with money in it.

				SUSIE (O.S.)

		I thought the Bakers didn't take

		tips.

	Jack glances up, but he knows the voice.

				JACK

		I give it all to charity.

	Susie nods.

				SUSIE

		Saw the sign outside.  Got your

		own sign, huh?

				JACK

		Yeah.  Got my own sign.

				SUSIE

		So ... ?

				JACK

		We outgrew each other.

				SUSIE

		Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't

		figure.  You two.

				JACK

		You don't pick your brother.

				SUSIE

		Yeah.

				JACK

		So how's the cat food business?

				SUSIE

		Terrific.  I'm doing vegetables next week.

	Jack nods.

				JACK

		What kind?

				SUSIE

		Huh?

				JACK

		Vegetables.

				SUSIE

		Oh. Carrots.  And peas.  None of

		the important ones.

	Susie tries a smile.  Takes a breath.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		Listen... you want to get a drink?  I got a new

		place.  Or we could go to a bar ...

			(looking around)

		Well, maybe not a bar.  But I know

		a place uptown, if you want --

				JACK

		I've given it up.

	Susie stops.

				SUSIE

		No kidding?  Well ... I guess you can't do a

		reunion over tomato juice, can you?

			(pause)

		Anyway, if you're ever in the

		neighborhood ... I wrote it down.

	Susie takes a slip of paper from her purse and hands

	it to Jack.  They lock eyes for a moment.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		Tell egghead I said hi.  If you

		see him.

				JACK

		If I see him.

	Susie nods and walks toward the door.

				JACK

			(continuing)

		Hey.

			(as she stops)

		You got pretty eyes.

	Susie smiles.  As she leaves, Jack studies the slip

	of paper in his hand, then drops it in the tip glass.  

	He glances at the door, swinging slowly shut in Susie's

	wake, then reaches into his coat and takes out a bottle.

	INT.  FRANK'S DEN

	Frank sits alone in the darkness of the den.  The

	cardboard stand-up is there, along with several old

	photographs, including one showing two skinny kids in

	tuxes standing with a glamorous Peggy Lee.  After a moment,

	Donna enters.

				DONNA

		Frank?  It's late, honey.

	Frank stays staring at the photograph of Peggy Lee.

				DONNA

			(continuing)

		Mrs. Lerner called after dinner.  Robbie can't make

		his lesson tomorrow.

	Donna waits for her husband to say something, then sees the

	photograph in his hand.

				FRANK

		You know how good he is?  It's like breathing

		with him.  I've always envied it.  But tonight,

		looking at all this -- at his face -- I don't know.  

		Maybe it's worse.  For him.

			(gesturing to the piano)

		It's funny.  When I sit here and play ... nothing.  

		But when I was up there with him...

		It was like I had the gift, too.

	INT.  FRANK'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NEXT DAY

	Frank is standing in the hallway of his house, leaning

	against the bathroom door.  It's locked.

				FRANK

		Come on, Jeremy.  Open the door.

	Somewhere in the house, the PHONE RINGS.  

	Frank ignores it.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Jeremy.  You want me to call your father?  

		He's not going to be very happy when he hears

		he's spending fifteen dollars an hour for you

		to sit on the toilet.

	Donna, looking shaken, steps into the hallway.

				DONNA

		Honey ...

				FRANK

		You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm

		playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next

		thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom.  

		There's nothing sharp in there, is there?

				DONNA

		Honey ...

				FRANK

		Where are our kids?  

		Has he got one of them in there?

				DONNA

		Frank.

	Frank finally looks at his wife.  She's crying.

	INT.  HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	Jack rushes down a hospital corridor and heads for the

	nurses station.  As he moves to the counter, Donna

	appears.

				JACK

		Donna.  Where is she?

	Donna just shakes her head.

				DONNA

		We tried the apartment, but after

		that we didn't know where to call.

	Jack looks frozen.

				DONNA

			(continuing)

		Frank'll be back in a moment.  

		He took Little Frank to the bathroom.

	Jack begins to back away slowly.

				DONNA

			(continuing)

		Jack ...

	EXT.  STREET

	Jack moves aimlessly down the street, slipping in

	and out of shadows.  Finally he stops inside a closed

	storefront, his back up against the window, and looks

	down at his hands.  They're shaking.

	INT.  APARTMENT HALLWAY

	Jack stands in an apartment hallway, waiting.  

	After a moment, the door opens.  It's Susie.

				SUSIE

		Jack.

				JACK

		Hi.

				SUSIE

		Well, this is some surprise.

			(seeing his face)

		Hey ... You don't look so good, pal.

	Susie studies Jack as he glances around the hallway.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		Jack?

	Jack looks up.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		You want to come in?

	He nods.  Susie steps back and Jack enters.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		Let me get the light.

				JACK

		No.

	He stares directly into her eyes.

				JACK

			(continuing)

		Leave it dark.

	INT.  SUSIE'S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING

	Jack is standing at the foot of the bed, looking down

	at Susie's naked back as she sleeps.  He studies her

	face as if looking for something, then takes his coat

	and begins to leave.

				SUSIE

		I used to do that.

	Jack turns.  Susie is looking at him.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		Sneak out in the morning.  Before the guy could

		wake up and ruin it.  Never figured I'd be on

		the other end of it, though.

				JACK

		I didn't want to wake you.

				SUSIE

			(smiling slightly)

		Yeah.

				JACK

		Thanks.  For letting me in last night.

				SUSIE

		Funny how life repeats itself, huh?  Over and over.  

		Like a song.

	Jack looks at Susie for a long moment, then nods and

	turns for the door.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		Hey.

	Jack stops, his hand on the doorknob.

				SUSIE

			(continuing)

		Am I gonna see you again?

	Jack looks at her face, beautiful in the morning light.

				JACK

		Yeah.  You're gonna see me again.

	Susie smiles slightly.

				SUSIE

		Okay.

	EXT.  STREET

	Jack is standing across the street from his mother's

	house, just looking.  After a moment, he crosses the

	street.  As he moves up the drive, he takes notice of

	the tree growing in the front yard and crosses to it,

	kneeling by the trunk and studying the scars there --

	cat's claws -- running vertically up the tree, the

	damage smoothed and widened by time.  He runs his

	fingers over the imperfection, then stands and walks

	toward the house.

	EXT.  HOUSE

	Through the screen door, Jack can hear a CLICKING

	sound and see partially into the front door.  Half

	the room is cast in shadow, the other in blinding light.  

	He opens the door and enters.

	INT.  HOUSE

	Inside, the movie PROJECTOR is RUNNING, the tail of a

	completed FLIP SLAPPING like a whip against the carriage.  

	Jack TURNS OFF the PROJECTOR and the room falls entirely

	into shadow.  For a moment, the house is silent, full of

	ghosts, then, gradually, a NOISE is heard coming from the

	kitchen.

	INT.  KITCHEN

	As Jack comes into the kitchen, he finds Frank searching

	through a cabinet.  He watches for a moment.

				JACK

		What're you looking for?

	Frank turns quickly, surprised.

				FRANK

		I didn't hear you come in.

				JACK

		What're you doing?

				FRANK

	Oh ... I was just hoping for something to drink.  But

	it seems the old lady was dry. Not even a bottle of

	cooking sherry.

	Jack nods.  Frank looks nervous.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Uh, we already boxed some things.  I figured you'd

		want to go through Dad's stuff.  It's in there.  

		If you want to get started.

				JACK

		Later.

	Frank nods.  Silence.

				JACK

			(continuing)

		Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.

				FRANK

		Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know.  

		She and Dad had taken care of it.

				JACK

		Right.

				FRANK

		I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're

		doing the stone today.

			(pause)

		It's okay?  Wednesday?

				JACK

		Yeah, fine.

				FRANK

		There's not going to be a viewing.

		I figured with the kids and all ...

				JACK

		Sure.

	Jack glances around the room.  Pictures on the walls.  

	Handmade curtains, lightly faded.

				FRANK

		It's funny.  Before, whenever I came here, the

		house seemed small.  But today ... I can't keep

		up with it. I keep losing my wind.

	Frank smiles slightly and he and Jack lock eyes for a

	moment.

				FRANK

			(continuing;glancing away)

		God, I could use a drink.

	Jack hesitates, then pulls a bottle out of his coat.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Oh. Well, great.  I'll get a couple glasses.

	Frank moves to a cabinet, but there's nothing there.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Damn.  Donna must've packed

		them up this morning.

	Jack holds out the bottle.

				JACK

		Go ahead.

				FRANK

		No.

				JACK

			(showing the seal is unbroken)

		Bought it on the way over.  Clean

		as a nun.

				FRANK

		No, it's not that.  I ... can't

		drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.

				JACK

		Oh, yeah, right.  I forgot.

	Frank looks embarrassed.

				FRANK

			(remembering)

		Oh, hey, I want to show you

		something.  Come on.

	Jack follows Frank back into the front room.  Frank

	stands before one of the tiny matching pianos and

	gestures Jack to the other.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Hit the C. Go ahead.

	Jack steps over to the other piano and taps, then Frank

	does the same.  Jack glances up in surprise.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		I'm right, aren't I? They're

		in tune.

	Jack hits the note again and nods in amazement.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		All these years.  She kept them in tune.  

		Can you imagine?  

		Now why would she do something like that?

	Frank looks down at the keys and his smile fades.  

	Suddenly he notices the collection of tiny souvenir shot

	glasses on top of the piano, each bearing the name of a

	different hotel.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Hey, what do you know.  Looks like we can have

		that drink after all.

			(picking up a few glasses)

		What's your pleasure?  We got the downtown Ramada.  

		We got the Travelodge on Route 41.  

		And ... the Mallory.

				JACK

		I'll take the Mallory.

				FRANK

		Good choice.

	Frank blows some dust off the glasses.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Looks like these got a few years on them.

				JACK

		This'll kill 'em.

	Jack pours and he and Frank settle on the tiny piano

	benches.  As Frank swallows, he winces.

				FRANK

		Jesus.

	It suddenly grows silent, each sitting in his old

	familiar place, staring into his glass.

				JACK

		How're your hands?

				FRANK

			(surprised)

		Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple

		sore knuckles.  Nothing.

				JACK

		You know, that night, I ... It

		just all came up.

				FRANK

		Yeah, I know.  Me, too.

				JACK

		I mean, you can play.  You're

		okay.

				FRANK

			(smiling)

		I can keep the beat.

	Jack smiles slightly, then both go back to their glasses.

				FRANK

			(continuing)

		Charlie called.

				JACK

		Yeah?

				FRANK

		Yeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others.  

		Donna said even Lloyd called the other day.  

		Nothing like a little absence to make the heart

		grow fonder, huh?

				JACK

		Yeah.

	Jack and Frank lock eyes again.  

	Frank's glance drops to Jack's glass.

				FRANK

		Jesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory?

				JACK

		Five years ago.

			(thinking)

		November.

				FRANK

		Right.  It was someone's birthday.

		Halloran?

				JACK

		Daughter's.  Sweet sixteen.

				FRANK

		Christ, that's right.  How could

		I forget.  What a nightmare.

				JACK

		She asked for it.

				FRANK

		I told Halloran we didn't do

		vocals, but he said:

				JACK AND FRANK

			(in unison)

		What my Sissy-wants, my Sissy gets.

				JACK

		She got it all right.

	Jack and Frank glance at one another, little boy

	mischief glowing in their faces.  Suddenly they swivel

	on the pianos and begin to play "You're Sixteen."

				JACK AND FRANK

			(singing)

		She comes on like a dream

		Peaches and cream

		Lips like strawberry wine

		She's sixteen, she's beautiful and she's mine.

		Ribbons and curls

		Ooh, what a girl

		Eyes that sparkle and shine

		You're sixteen, you're beautiful, and you're mine.

	As Jack and Frank finish, they're laughing.  After a

	moment, their voices die and the house is quiet again.  

	Full of ghosts.  Each stares at the tiny keyboard before

	him, awkward with the intimacy of the moment.  It is

	quiet for a very long time.  Finally, Frank looks over.

				FRANK

		Well ... One more time?

	Jack glances up and sees Frank has his empty glass

	held out.  He hesitates, then picks up the bottle.

				JACK

		One more time.
