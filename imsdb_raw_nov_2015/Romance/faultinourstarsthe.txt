                            THE FAULT IN OUR STARS

                                  Written by

                      Scott Neustadter & Michael H. Weber

                             Based on the novel by

                                  John Green

                                                          May 1, 2012

                                                          FIRST DRAFT

          HAZEL GRACE LANCASTER (16) lies in the grass, staring up at

          the stars. We're CLOSE ON her FACE and we hear:

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           You have a choice in this world, I

           believe, about how to tell sad

           stories.

          CUT TO a SERIES OF QUICK IMAGES:

          - Hazel and the BOY we will come to know as AUGUSTUS "GUS"

          WATERS (17) at an outdoor restaurant in some magical place.

          [They look very much like the perfect Hollywood couple.]

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           On the one hand, you can sugar coat

           - the way they do in movies and

           romance novels.

          - "Perfect" Hazel and "Perfect" Gus sit on a BENCH

          overlooking an incredible seascape in some foreign country.

          She rests her head on his shoulder.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           Where villains are vanquished

           and... heroes are born and...

          - "Perfect" Hazel and "Perfect" Gus kiss in a dark room.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           ... beautiful people learn

           beautiful lessons...

          - "Perfect" Hazel and "Perfect" Gus fall onto a bed together.

          They look deep into one another's eyes.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           ... and nothing is too messed up

           that can't be fixed with an apology

           and a Peter Gabriel song.

          BACK TO Hazel on the grass, still watching the stars. Were

          those dreams or were they memories? Still unclear.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           I like that way as much as the next

           girl, believe me. It's just not the

           truth.

          Hazel closes her eyes.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           This is the truth.

          And EVERYTHING GOES BLACK. We HEAR:

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           Sorry.

           FADE IN ON:

           2.

          INT DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

          The real Hazel is no less beautiful than the one we just saw.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           Late in the Winter of my 17th

           year...

          There are, however, some key and obvious differences.

          First, you'll notice the OXYGEN TUBE in her nostrils which

          help her to breathe.

          Second, you'll notice her hair - which we couldn't see in the

          grass. It's much shorter than the "Perfect" version, the

          result of someone whose head was completely shaved a few

          years before.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           ... my mother decided I was

           depressed.

                          HAZEL

           I'm not depressed.

          Hazel's legs dangle over the side of an exam table. Her

          mother FRANNIE (early 40s, younger than she feels) explains

          to the DOCTOR:

                          FRANNIE

           ... she eats like a bird. She

           barely leaves the house,

                          HAZEL

           I'm not depressed.

                          FRANNIE

           ... she reads the same book over

           and over...

                          DOCTOR

           She's depressed.

                          HAZEL

           I'm not depressed!

          Off her look, CUT TO:

          QUICK SEQUENCE, which play over:

                          HAZEL (V.O.)

           The booklets and web sites always

           list depression as a side effect of

           cancer...

          - A SHOPPING MALL. Filled with TEENAGE GIRLS - gossipping,

          laughing - being teenage girls, basically. And here's Hazel.

          With her Mom. And her oxygen tank. Just another day.

           3.

                          HAZEL (V.O.)

           Depression's not a side effect of

           cancer...

          - HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM. She sits watching game shows in the

          middle of the afternoon. Her Mom brings her a sandwich. A

          glass of water. And then a whole host of prescription meds.

          Hazel eyes them with indifference.

                          HAZEL (V.O.)

           ... it's a side effect of dying.

          - A STARBUCKS. Hazel sits alone reading a dog-eared, heavily

          underlined copy of a novel ("An Imperial Affliction" by Peter

          Van Houten). She only looks up when distracted by a squeal of

          delight. A YOUNG GUY has lifted a YOUNG GIRL over his

          shoulder playfully. He spins her around. Hazel watches a beat

          - goes back to the book.

                          HAZEL (V.O.)

           Which is what was happening to me.

          And we CUT BACK TO:

          INT DOCTOR'S OFFICE - SAME

          Frannie continues to talk to the doctor. Hazel continues to

          dangle her feet.

                          FRANNIE

           ... some days she won't even get

           out of bed.

          The Doctor scratches his beard, thinking.

                          DOCTOR

           I may switch you to Zoloft. Or

           Lexapro. And twice a day instead of

           once.

                          HAZEL

           Why stop there?

                          DOCTOR

           Hmm?

                          HAZEL

           Keep `em coming. I can take it. I'm

           like the Keith Richards of cancer

           kids.

          The Doctor looks at Frannie who just shakes her head.

                          DOCTOR

           Have you been going to that Support

           Group I suggested?

          Instead of answering, Hazel looks at her Mom.

           4.

                          FRANNIE

           She's gone a few times.

                          HAZEL

           I'm not sure it's for me.

                          DOCTOR

           If you're depressed --

                          HAZEL

                          (EXASPERATED)

           I'm not de--

                          DOCTOR

                          (IGNORING HER)

           -- support Groups are a great way

           to connect with people who are...

                          HAZEL

           What?

                          DOCTOR

                          (BEAT)

           On the same journey.

                          HAZEL

           "Journey?" Really?

                          FRANNIE

           Hazel.

                          DOCTOR

           Just give it a chance, ok? For me.

          Hazel rolls her eyes, knows she's lost this battle.

                          DOCTOR

           Who knows? You might even find

           it... enlightening.

           SMASH CUT TO:

          INT CHURCH BASEMENT - DAY

          CLOSE UP on PATRICK (30s, pony-tail). He has a guitar.

                          PATRICK

           ... we are gathered here today -

           literally - in the heart of Jesus.

          ANGLE on Hazel who just shakes her head. This is the lamest

          thing she could be doing right now.

                          PATRICK

           Who would like to share their story

           with the group?

          The basement is filled with SICK PEOPLE. Hazel among them.

          Most are under the age of 18. QUICK CUTS:

           5.

                          SPEAKER #1

           Jillian. 15. Lymphoma.

                          SPEAKER #2

           Angel. 17. Ewing sarcoma.

                          PATRICK

           Patrick. 34. Testicular. It started

           a few years ago, when I was...

          As Hazel watches, bored, and Patrick continues, we hear:

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           I'll spare you the gory details of

           Patrick's ball cancer. Basically,

           they found it in his nuts, cut most

           of it out, he almost died, but he

           didn't die, and now here he is -

           divorced, friendless, addicted to

           video games, exploiting his

           cancertastic past in the heart of

           Jesus - "literally" - to show us

           that one day - if we're lucky - we

           could be just like him.

          They all say:

           ALL IN UNISON

           "We're here for you Patrick."

          Hazel says it the least enthusiastically. She locks eyes with

          her only friend in Support Group, a blonde kid with an eye

          patch, ISAAC. He's also shaking his head.

                          PATRICK

           Who else would like to share?

                          (NO RESPONSE)

           Hazel?

          Oh no. Patrick gestures for her to speak. Reluctantly she

          stands, sighs...

                          HAZEL

           I'm, uh, Hazel. 16.

                          (BEAT)

           Thyroid originally but with quite

           the impressive satellite colony in

           my lungs.

          Not much more to say, Hazel is about to sit down.

                          PATRICK

           And how are you doing Hazel?

          Hazel has no idea how to answer that.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           You mean besides the terminal

           cancer?

           6.

          But that's not what she says. She says:

                          HAZEL

           Alright? I guess...?

          Isaac tries not to laugh at this. Hazel sits back down.

           ALL IN UNISON

           "We're here for you Hazel."

          Hazel exhales. This is not at all helpful. A few more beats.

                          PATRICK

           Maybe now I'll play a song...

          EXT CHURCH - LATER

          Frannie sits in the car in the parking lot, reading from a

          book, waiting for Group to be over. She sees the church door

          open and puts the book away. Hazel comes out. Frannie looks

          at her like "well, was it great?" Hazel just exhales and gets

          in the car. CUT TO:

          INT HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM - ANOTHER DAY

          "America's Next Top Model" is on the TV. Hazel sits on one

          side of the L-shaped couch, flipping through her novel.

          Frannie and Hazel's dad MICHAEL (40s, kind, doing his best to

          stay positive) sit on the other side, watching her - but

          trying not to make it seem that way. After a few beats:

                          FRANNIE

           It's Friday night.

                          HAZEL

           Hmm?

                          FRANNIE

           I was just thinking... you should

           call your friends, see what they're

           up to.

                          HAZEL

                          (DISINTERESTED)

           That's ok.

          Frannie and Michael look at one another, don't say anything.

                          MICHAEL

           Wanna see a movie?

          Hazel looks up from the book. Sees her parents. Gets an idea.

                          HAZEL

           Why don't you guys go to a movie?

           (off their look)

                          (MORE)

           7.

                          HAZEL (CONT'D)

           You haven't been out in a while.

           Go. Have fun. Take the night off.

          Frannie and Michael look at one another again.

                          MICHAEL

           This is a really good show.

          Hazel sighs. And just like that, everyone goes back to what

          they were doing. CUT TO:

          QUICK SEQUENCE, which plays over:

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           And that was my life.

          - Hazel watching TV, book in hand.

          - Hazel in another doctor's office.

          - Hazel popping pills.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           Reality shows. Doctor's

           appointments. Eight prescription

           drugs, three times a day.

          INT HAZEL'S KITCHEN - ANOTHER DAY

          Hazel and her parents in the kitchen.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           And worse worse worst of all...

           support group.

                          HAZEL

           Ugh. You can't make me.

                          MICHAEL

           Of course we can, we're your

           parents.

          Hazel frowns.

                          MICHAEL

           Hazel, you need to get out of the

           house. Make friends. Be a teenager.

                          HAZEL

           If you want me to be a teenager,

           don't send me to Support Group. Buy

           me a fake ID so I can go to clubs

           and drink gimlets and take pot.

                          MICHAEL

           You don't take pot.

           8.

                          HAZEL

           See, that's the kind of thing I

           would know with a fake ID.

                          FRANNIE

                          (BEAT)

           Get in the car.

          Hazel mock stabs herself in the stomach with an invisible

          sword. CUT TO:

          EXT CHURCH - ESTABLISHING

          A small Episcopalian sanctuary in suburban Indianapolis.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           And so I went...

          Frannie's car pulls up close to the back entrance.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           Not because I wanted to or because

           I thought it would help. But for

           the same reason I did anything

           these days...

          Hazel, oxygen tank in toe, gets out of the car with Frannie's

          assistance.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           ... to make my parents happy.

                          HAZEL

           Are you gonna sit here and wait the

           whole time?

                          FRANNIE

           Of course not, no. I...

           (she totally is)

           I have errands to run.

          Hazel knows she's not planning to run any errands. She

          doesn't press the issue.

                          HAZEL

           Ok.

                          FRANNIE

           Love you.

                          HAZEL

           Love you too Mom.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           The only thing worse than biting it

           from cancer - is having a kid bite

           it from cancer.

          As Frannie gets back in the car, she shouts to her daughter:

           9.

                          FRANNIE

           Make some friends!

          Hazel just shakes her head. CUT TO:

          INT CHURCH - SAME

          Hazel walks towards the elevator. An EXTREMELY SICK LOOKING

          KID holds it open for her. Hazel thinks better of it.

                          HAZEL

           I'll take the stairs.

          The KID nods. The doors shut. Hazel is reminded - it could

          always be worse. She turns to go, walking right into:

                          GUS HAZEL

          Ooph. Sorry!

          A SUPREMELY BEAUTIFUL BOY (we will come to know him as GUS).

          Tall, lean, muscular, straight short mahogany hair, blue

          eyes. Hazel has never seen a better looking kid in her life.

                          GUS HAZEL

          My bad. No, it's...

          For a brief moment, the Earth stops. They stand looking at

          one another. Hazel is speechless.

                          HAZEL

           Excuse me.

          With the Beautiful Boy watching, a wan smile on his face,

          Hazel shuffles off as fast as she can, ducking into:

          INT BATHROOM - SAME

          Hazel catches her breath. Shakes her head. Surprised at

          herself.

          She looks in the mirror. So doesn't like what she sees. The

          Earth starts moving again. CUT TO:

          INT CHURCH BASEMENT - LATER

          Hazel sits in the Circle of Sick.

                          PATRICK

           Who would like to begin?

          No volunteers. Hazel catches sight of the Beautiful Boy,

          sitting next to Isaac. He seems to be watching her, that same

          flirty smile on his face. She self-consciously looks away.

           10.

                          PATRICK

           Isaac, I know you're facing a

           challenging time. Perhaps you would

           like to say something...

          Isaac nods, rises.

                          ISAAC

           Yeah, um... I'm Isaac. 17. Eye

           cancer.

                          (BEAT)

           It's looking like another surgery

           in a couple weeks. After which,

           well, I'll be blind...

          Hazel tries to focus on what Isaac's saying but it's

          difficult. She still feels the Beautiful Boy's gaze on her.

                          ISAAC

           Not that I'm complaining or

           anything. I know a lot of you have

           it way worse but, still, I mean,

           you know, being blind's gonna

           suck...

          As Isaac shares, the Beautiful Boy doesn't look away from

          Hazel. Hazel finds this intimidating. And intimidation

          irritates her. So she decides to play the game with him,

          meeting his gaze and holding it just as firmly.

          A staring contest.

                          ISAAC

           ...My girlfriend helps. And friends

           like Augustus here...

          Isaac nods towards the Beautiful Boy who now has a name -

          AUGUSTUS. He still doesn't look away from Hazel.

                          ISAAC

           So... yeah. That's what's up.

           ALL IN UNISON

           "We're here for you Isaac."

          The staring contest continues another few beats until:

                          PATRICK

           And does your friend want to speak?

          This causes the Beautiful Boy to momentarily look away. Aha,

          he's lost the contest! Hazel smiles, flicks her eyebrows up

          as if to say "Victory is mine!" He smiles back at her, the

          most radiant smile on the planet. He turns back to the Group.

                          GUS

           Hi. I'm Augustus Waters. 17. Had a

           touch of osteosarcoma bout a year

           and a half ago - lost this baby as

           a result...

           11.

          Gus holds up his right leg - a prosthetic.

                          GUS

           But really I'm just here at Isaac's

           request.

                          PATRICK

           And how are you feeling Augustus?

                          GUS

           Me? Oh I'm grand. I'm on a roller

           coaster that only goes up, my

           friend.

          Hazel smiles. Gus catches this. Embarrassed, she stops

          smiling and looks away.

                          PATRICK

           Perhaps you'd like to share your

           fears with the group, Augustus.

                          GUS

           My fears?

          Gus thinks about this.

                          GUS

           Oblivion.

                          PATRICK

           Oblivion?

          ANGLE ON Hazel, intrigued.

                          GUS

           Yeah, see... I intend to live an

           extraordinary life. To be

           remembered. If I'm scared of

           anything it's... not doing that.

          Patrick doesn't quite have the tools to deal with that.

                          PATRICK

           Would, uh, anyone like to speak to

           that?

          And Hazel's hand goes up. Even Patrick is surprised by that.

                          PATRICK

           Hazel! That's unexpected.

          Hazel stands, takes a second to gather her thoughts. Augustus

          watches her, waits for it.

                          HAZEL

           I just wanna say... there will come

           a time when, you know, all of us

           are dead.

          Gus is now even more fixed on her than before.

           12.

                          HAZEL

           It might be tomorrow. Might be a

           million years from now but... it's

           gonna happen. And when it does,

           enough generations will come and

           go, there'll be no one left to

           remember Cleopatra. Or Mozart. Or

           Muhammad Ali, let alone any of us,

           right?

          The look on Gus's face is unreadable.

                          HAZEL

           Oblivion's inevitable. And if that

           scares you, well, I suggest you

           ignore it. God knows it's what

           everyone else does.

          A beat. And then an enormous smile spreads across Gus's face,

          not a flirty smile but a surprised one, a real one. CUT TO:

          EXT OUTSIDE THE CHURCH - LATER

          Hazel waits for her Mom's car to appear.

          Across the parking lot, she sees Isaac going at it with a

          redhead, MONICA (17), sucking face like there's no tomorrow

          against the door of her green Pontiac Firebird. Between

          kisses, we can hear:

                          ISAAC MONICA

          Always. Always.

          And Hazel hears:

                          GUS

           Literally.

          Hazel turns to find the Beautiful Boy, Augustus, standing

          right next to her.

                          GUS

           I thought we were in a church

           basement but apparently we were

           literally in the heart of Jesus.

          Hazel smiles.

                          HAZEL

           Someone should probably tell him,

           don't you think? Jesus? Seems kinda

           dangerous keeping all these kids

           with cancer in your heart.

          Gus laughs.

                          GUS

           What's your name?

           13.

                          HAZEL

           Hazel.

                          GUS

           No your full name?

                          HAZEL

                          (CONFUSED)

           Hazel Grace Lancaster.

          Gus nods to himself, smiles. Still fixated on her.

                          HAZEL

           What?

                          GUS

           I didn't say anything.

                          HAZEL

           Why are you looking at me like

           that?

                          GUS

           Because you're beautiful.

          Hazel is taken aback. No one's ever said that to her before.

                          GUS

           I enjoy looking at beautiful people

           and I decided a while back not to

           deny myself the simpler pleasures

           of existence. Particularly given

           that, as you so astutely pointed

           out, we're all gonna die pretty

           soon.

                          HAZEL

                          (BEAT)

           I'm not beaut --

          A CUTE YOUNG GIRL walks past them.

                          YOUNG GIRL

           Hey Gus.

                          GUS

           Hey Alisa.

          Hazel isn't surprised that other girls know Gus. Of course

          they do. She turns back towards Isaac and Monica pawing at

          each other. She hears:

                          ISAAC MONICA

          Always. Always.

                          HAZEL

           What's with the "always?"

           14.

                          GUS

           "Always" is their thing. They'll

           "always" love each other and

           whatnot. Must have texted "always"

           to each other at least four million

           times this year.

          They continue to watch the show. It's pretty gross. Isaac

          squeezes Monica's breast like a clown horn.

                          HAZEL

           He's gotta be hurting her boob.

                          GUS

           Let's watch a movie.

          Hazel is again surprised.

                          HAZEL

           Oh. Um. Uh...

           (yes!)

           Sure. Yeah. I'm... pretty free this

                          WEEK--

                          GUS

           No I mean now.

                          HAZEL

           What?

                          GUS

           Hmm?

                          HAZEL

           What do you mean "now?"

                          GUS

           I've got a car.

          He shrugs. Hazel has never seen someone so confident.

                          HAZEL

           You could be an axe murderer.

                          GUS

           There is that possibility.

                          (BEAT)

           Come on Hazel Grace... take a risk.

          As Hazel mulls this over, Gus reaches into his pocket and

          pulls out, of all things, a pack of cigarettes! Hazel is in

          disbelief. He flips the box open, puts a cigarette between

          his lips.

                          HAZEL

           Oh my god. Oh. My. God. You're

           kidding right?

           (off his look)

           You just ruined the whole thing!

           15.

                          GUS

           Whole thing?

                          HAZEL

           What, you think that's cool? Oh you

           idiot! There's always a hamartia,

           isn't there? And yours is - even

           though you had FREAKING CANCER you

           give money to a corporation for the

           chance to acquire EVEN MORE

           CANCER!? Ugh. And you were doing so

           well.

          As she rants, Gus continues to look at her with that smile on

          his face. Hazel does not find it so amusing.

                          HAZEL

           Let me tell you... not being able

           to breathe? Sucks. Totally sucks.

                          GUS

           Hamartia?

          Hazel folds her arms and turns away from him.

                          HAZEL

           A fatal flaw.

          Gus takes a beat and then moves to face her, the smile still

          etched on his face.

                          GUS

           They don't hurt you unless you

           light them.

                          HAZEL

           Sorry?

                          GUS

           I've never lit one.

          Hazel turns back to him.

                          GUS

           It's a metaphor. See? You put the

           thing that kills you between your

           teeth. But you don't give it the

           power to do the killing.

          Hazel is floored. And impressed.

                          HAZEL

           Metaphor.

          Gus holds her gaze. And it's at this point Frannie pulls up.

                          FRANNIE

           Hi sweetheart. Ready for some

           "Model?"

           16.

          Hazel looks at Gus, cigarette dangling from his lips. Cool as

          anything. Handsome as hell. She looks back at her mom.

                          HAZEL

           Can't tonight.

           (off her confused look)

           I've made plans with Augustus

           Waters.

          And with that, she walks off. Frannie looks at the boy with

          the cigarette in his mouth. This could be trouble. Or

          awesome. Or both. And we CUT TO:

          INT GUS'S CAR - LATER

          Hazel is terrified. Turns out, Gus is the world's worst

          driver. When he brakes, her body flies forward against the

          seatbelt. And when he hits the gas, seconds later, her neck

          snaps back in the seat. Gus sees the look on her face.

                          GUS

           I failed the test a couple times.

                          HAZEL

           You don't say.

                          GUS

           Most amputees can drive with no

           problem but... yeah. Not me.

                          HAZEL

           I'm surprised you have a license.

                          GUS

           Tell me about it!

          Another brake forces Hazel against the seat belt.

                          GUS

           The fourth time I took the test...

           it was going about how this is

           going... and when it was over, the

           instructor looks at me and goes,

           "your driving, while unpleasant...

           is not technically unsafe."

                          HAZEL

           Aha. Cancer perk.

                          GUS

           Total cancer perk.

          A few beats of silence.

                          GUS

           So what happened to you?

          Hazel takes a deep breath. She's told this story before but

          somehow this seems different.

           17.

                          HAZEL

           I was 13 when they found it.

          And as she speaks, we see it unfold. SMASH CUT TO:

          INT HOSPITAL BED - FLASHBACK

          13-YEAR OLD HAZEL has a biopsy.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           Stage IV thyroid cancer.

          INT OPERATING ROOM - FLASHBACK

          13-YEAR OLD HAZEL on the operating table. It's a nightmare.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           I had surgery first.

          INT SEVERAL MORE HOSPITAL ROOMS - FLASHBACK

          This poor little girl is taking a beating. And it's just

          getting started.

          - Radiation treatment.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           Then Radiation...

          - Having her head shaved by Frannie.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           Then Chemo...

          - With a PICC line in a chemo chair.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           All of which worked for a while.

          - A RADIOLOGIST looks at an X-ray. He's not pleased.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           And then stopped working.

          - 14-Year Old Hazel lies in bed, struggling to breathe.

          Frannie runs her fingers through her hair. Dad calls 9-1-1.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           And then my lungs started filling

           up with water.

          - In the ICU, her parents standing over her.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           That should have been the end.

           18.

                          FRANNIE

           (through the tears)

           Are you ready, sweetie?

          14-Year Old Hazel nods. Michael can't keep it together any

          longer. He completely breaks down.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           But it wasn't.

          INT ICU - THE NEXT MORNING

          The sun shines in the room. 14-year old Hazel eats ice chips,

          the color has returned to her cheeks.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           The antibiotics kicked in. They

           drained the fluid from my lungs.

           And in time I got better. Stronger.

          INT YET ANOTHER HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

          Slightly older Hazel is getting more intravenous medication.

          It's never ending.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           I even found myself in an

           experimental trial. You know the

           ones that are famous in the

           Republic of Cancervania for not

           working.

          - A SECOND RADIOLOGIST examines a second X-ray.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           It's called Phalanxifor. Didn't

           work in over 70 percent of patients

           but, for some reason...

          The Radiologist looks surprised.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           ...it worked in me. They called it

           "The Miracle."

          And finally, BACK TO:

          INT GUS'S CAR - SAME

          Gus has one eye on the road, the other on Hazel. He was

          impressed with her before. He's totally dazzled now.

                          HAZEL

           Tumors shrank, my mets have hardly

           grown since...

                          (MORE)

           19.

                          HAZEL (CONT'D)

           Of course my lungs still suck but,

           theoretically, they could continue

           to suck in just this way for, I

           dunno, a while maybe.

                          GUS

           Wow.

                          HAZEL

           Yeah.

                          GUS

           So are you back in school or...?

                          HAZEL

           Can't.

                          GUS

           Why not?

                          HAZEL

           Got my GED.

                          GUS

           A college girl! Well that explains

           the aura of sophistication...

          He smiles at her. She smiles back. Shoves his upper arm

          playfully. They're easing into each other.

          Eventually Gus's car pulls into his driveway.

                          GUS

           We're here.

          He's as good at parking as he is at driving. CUT TO:

          EXT/INT GUS'S HOUSE - SAME

          Hazel follows Gus inside. She quickly notices all sorts of

          engraved plaques and framed signs with phrases like "Home is

          Where the Heart Is" and "True Love is Born from Hard Times."

          Hazel looks at Gus quizzically.

                          GUS

           My parents call them

           "encouragements."

           (rolling his eyes)

           Don't ask.

          Gus's MOM and DAD (40s) are in the kitchen making dinner.

                          GUS

           Hey guys.

                          GUS'S MOM

           Augustus, hi. New friend?

           20.

          Gus's parents don't seem surprised to see Gus with some

          random girl in their house. Hazel takes note of that.

                          GUS

           This is Hazel Grace.

                          HAZEL

           It's just... Hazel.

                          GUS'S DAD

           How's it going, Just Hazel?

                          GUS

                          (ABRUPTLY)

           Downstairs if you need us!

          Gus drags Hazel to the next room. As she's pulled:

                          HAZEL

           Nice to meet you!

          They walk down the carpeted stairs - Gus having an easier

          time with his one leg than Hazel is with her oxygen tank and

          weak lungs.

          Eventually they arrive at Gus's basement bedroom. There's a

          TV with a video game console, a few band posters, and a whole

          host of basketball memorabilia (autographed sneakers, school

          trophies, framed images etc.) Gus sees her looking at them.

                          GUS

           I used to play.

                          HAZEL

           Must have been pretty good.

                          GUS

           These are mine. And these. The rest

           of it's just cancer perks.

          Gus grabs a DVD from his stack of DVDs. Hazel sits down on

          the bed, her breathing noticeably heavier.

                          HAZEL

           Need to sit.

          Gus sits down next to her on the bed.

                          HAZEL

           Don't get any ideas.

           (catching her breath)

           All that standing... and stairs...

           and then more standing... lotta

           standing for me.

                          GUS

           I understand.

           21.

                          HAZEL

           I'll be fine in a minute. Unless I

           faint. I'm a bit of a Victorian

           lady, fainting-wise.

          Gus smiles. He waits for her breathing to slow down. In time:

                          GUS

           You ok?

          Hazel nods, smiles.

                          GUS

           So what's your story?

                          HAZEL

           I already told you my story. I was

                          DIAGNOSED --

                          GUS

           Not your cancer story. Your story.

           Interests, hobbies, passions, weird

           fetishes...

                          HAZEL

           Um...

                          GUS

           Don't tell me you're one of those

           people who becomes their disease.

                          HAZEL

           No. I'm just... I don't know... un-

           extraordinary.

                          GUS

           I reject that out of hand.

           (beat, Hazel shrugs)

           Think of something you love. First

           thing that comes to mind.

                          HAZEL

           "An Imperial Affliction."

                          GUS

           Ok. What's that?

                          HAZEL

           It's a novel. My favorite novel.

                          GUS

           Does it have zombies?

                          HAZEL

                          (LAUGHING)

           What? No.

                          GUS

           Stormtroopers.

           22.

                          HAZEL

           Seriously?

                          (HE SHRUGS)

           It's not that kind of book.

                          GUS

           Sounds horrible.

                          HAZEL

           It's not, it's... kind of my bible

           actually.

                          GUS

           Interesting. What's it about?

                          HAZEL

           Cancer.

           (off his look)

           But not in that way, trust me. The

           guy who wrote it, Peter Van Houten,

           he's... well, the only person I've

           ever come across who seems to a)

           understand what it's like to be

           dying and b) not have died.

                          GUS

                          (INTRIGUED)

           In that case... I am going to read

           this horrible book with the boring

           title that does not contain zombies

           or stormtroopers. And in

           exchange...

          Gus pulls a book from his bookshelf.

                          GUS

           ... all I ask is that you read this

           brilliant and haunting novelization

           of my favorite video game.

          Hazel looks at the slim, ridiculous novella. She laughs.

          She's adorable when she laughs. She takes the book from him

          and as she does, their hands get tangled together for a

          brief, charged moment.

                          GUS

           Your hands are cold.

                          HAZEL

           Not so much cold as under-

           oxygenated.

                          GUS

           Ooh Hazel Grace...

                          (BEAT)

           I love it when you talk medical to

           me.

          Hazel blushes. And off her completely smitten smile, CUT TO:

           23.

          INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT

          Hazel sits in bed reading Gus's novella. Frannie stands in

          the doorway, notices the new book.

                          FRANNIE

           That's different.

          Hazel shrugs. Frannie looks intrigued.

                          FRANNIE

           Did he give it to you?

                          HAZEL

           By "it" do you mean herpes?

          Frannie rolls her eyes. Hazel's phone buzzes. She excitedly

          checks it - only to be disappointed. Frannie notices.

                          FRANNIE

           I'm sure he'll call, don't worry.

                          HAZEL

           I'm not worried. Please. It's not

           like I'm waiting for him to call or

           anything. I just... we hung out. No

           big deal.

          Frannie says nothing to that. Her silence says it all. Hazel

          rolls her eyes. CUT TO:

          QUICK SERIES OF SCENES:

          Hazel continues "not to wait" for Gus's call. We see her:

          - Brushing her teeth. And checking her phone.

          - Watching TV. And checking her phone.

          - Eating breakfast. And checking her phone.

          - Looking out the window on a rainy day. Trying not to check

          her phone. Willing herself to not check the goddamn phone.

          And checking the phone.

          Where is he?! Did he forget about her?

          INT HAZEL'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

          Hazel at the dinner table with her parents. She's a little

          sullen, barely touching her food.

          Hazel's phone buzzes. She tries not to seem too eager to

          check it, what with her parents watching and all. She subtly

          looks down at her lap. And sure enough: a text from Gus! Her

          eyes bug out. We see:

           24.

          "Tell me my copy is missing the last ten pages or something."

          Hazel smiles. Goes back to eating. Frannie and Michael share

          a quick glance. A second later, there's a follow-up text.

          "Tell me I have NOT reached the end of this book!"

          Hazel smiles again.

          And then a third text:

          "A BOOK CAN"T END IN THE MIDDLE OF A SENTENCE?! WHAT IN GOD'S

          NAME IS THIS MADNESS! AAAAHHHH!"

          Hazel now laughs out loud. Michael clears his throat. Hazel

          looks up.

                          MICHAEL

           Would you like to be excused?

          EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

          Hazel sits down on a patio chair and dials the phone. Gus

          answers on the first ring.

           GUS (O.S.)

           Hazel Grace.

                          HAZEL

           Welcome to the sweet torture of

           reading "An Imperial --"

          At which point she hears a loud WAIL coming from the other

          end of the phone.

                          HAZEL

           What the -- are you ok?

           GUS (O.S.)

           Me? Yeah. I'm excellent.

          INTERCUT between Hazel on the patio and:

          INT GUS'S BASEMENT BEDROOM - SAME

          Isaac's head is buried in Gus's couch. He's wailing like a

          banshee, having some kind of nervous breakdown.

                          GUS

                          (INTO PHONE)

           I am, however, with Isaac.

          Hazel hears more wailing. Has no idea what to make of it.

           25.

           GUS (O.S.)

                          (TO ISAAC)

           Dude! Hey! Does Support Group Hazel

           make this better or worse?

          Hazel genuinely has no idea what the hell is going on.

                          GUS

           Isaac! Focus. On. Me.

          Hazel waits a few beats for Gus to come back on. Finally:

           GUS (O.S.)

                          (TO HAZEL)

           How fast can you get here?

          Hazel thinks about this. And on her face, CUT TO:

          INT GUS'S BASEMENT - LATER

          Hazel descends the steps. She hears an ungodly moan before

          she sees anyone. What has she gotten herself into? Gus

          appears at the base.

                          GUS

           (calling to Isaac)

           Isaac, Hazel from Support Group is

           coming downstairs.

          Gus waits for a response. None comes. He gestures for her to

          follow him into the room. Before he does:

                          GUS

           A gentle reminder: Isaac is in the

           midst of a psychotic episode.

                          (HAZEL NODS)

           You look nice, by the way.

          Hazel blushes, follows Gus into the room to find Isaac

          sitting upside down in a gaming chair. Tears are flowing down

          his reddened cheeks. Empty soda cans and bags of junk food

          lie around him.

                          HAZEL

           How ya doing Isaac?

          Again, no response. Hazel looks to Gus for an explanation.

                          GUS

           Seems Isaac and Monica are no

           longer a going concern.

                          HAZEL

           Oh I'm sorry.

                          (BEAT)

           Do you want to talk about it?

          Isaac starts to sob again.

           26.

                          GUS

           He just wants to cry and play video

           games.

                          HAZEL

           Fair enough.

                          GUS

           It doesn't hurt to talk to him,

           however. If you have any sage words

           of feminine advice...

                          HAZEL

           I actually think his response is

           appropriate.

                          GUS

           "Pain demands to be felt."

                          HAZEL

           (lights up at that)

           You're quoting my book!

          Gus winks at her. At which point, Isaac lets out another

          howl. Gus gestures for Hazel to sit. The two of them flank

          Isaac. He finally speaks.

                          ISAAC

           She didn't want to do it after the

           surgery. Said she couldn't handle

           it. I'm about to lose my eyesight

           and she can't handle it.

          Hazel rubs his shoulder in sympathy.

                          ISAAC

           I kept saying "always" to her.

           Always, always, always. And she

           just kept talking over me and not

           saying it back. It was like I was

           already gone, you know? "Always"

           was a promise! You can't break

           promises.

                          HAZEL

           Sometimes people don't understand

           the promises they're making when

           they make them.

                          ISAAC

           Right, sure, but you keep the

           promise anyway. That's what love

           is. Love is keeping the promise

           anyway.

                          GUS

           That could be an "encouragement."

          It's silent for a beat. And then Isaac stands up, a funny

          look on his face.

           27.

                          GUS

           Isaac...?

          Suddenly Isaac starts kicking his chair across the room.

                          GUS

           Here we go...

          The chair lands against the bed. Gus hands Isaac something

          else to throw, a pillow. Isaac grabs the pillow and slams it

          against the wall. He dives on it and beings pummeling the

          pillow like a maniac.

                          GUS

           That's it! Punch that thing.

          And so he does. As he continues to, Gus looks at Hazel,

          cigarette dangling from his mouth.

                          GUS

           I've been wanting to call you on a

           nearly minutely basis but I have

           been waiting until I could form a

           coherent thought in re: "An

           Imperial Affliction."

                          (SHE SMILES)

           I can't stop thinking about it.

                          HAZEL

           I know, right?

                          GUS

           The only problem is the ending.

                          HAZEL

           It is rather abrupt.

                          GUS

           It's torture! I mean, I totally get

           that she died or whatever - Anna.

           But there is an unwritten contract

           between author and reader and I

           think ending your book in the

           middle of a sentence kind of

           violates that contract.

                          HAZEL

           But that's part of what I like

           about it. It portrays death

           truthfully. You die in the middle

           of your life, in the middle of a

           sentence. But I do - God, I do want

           to know what happens to everyone

           else.

                          GUS

           Yeah like her Mom.

                          HAZEL

           The Dutch Tulip Man...

           28.

                          GUS

           Sysiphus the Hamster...

          Hazel beams. Gus totally gets the book. A bond between them.

                          GUS

           Have you tried contacting this...

           Peter Van Houten?

                          HAZEL

           I've written letters. He's never

           responded. Apparently he moved to

           Amsterdam, became a recluse. Hasn't

           published anything. Doesn't do

           interviews.

                          GUS

           Sad.

                          (BEAT)

           Hang on.

           (turns to Isaac)

           Isaac!

          Gus stands and takes the pillow out of Isaac's hand.

                          GUS

           Pillows don't break.

          Gus hands Isaac one of his basketball TROPHIES.

                          GUS

           You need to break something.

          Isaac looks at it, then back to Gus as if asking permission.

          Gus nods. Isaac holds it over his head and SMASH! The trophy

          breaks into a million pieces. Isaac almost smiles. Gus hands

          him another.

                          GUS

           Go to town, my friend.

          And Isaac does. Smashing them one by one. Hazel looks at Gus.

                          GUS

           I've been looking for a way to tell

           my Dad that I kinda hate

           basketball. Think maybe we've found

           it.

          Isaac grabs more of the TROPHIES, smashing them to pieces.

          Gus and Hazel enjoy the spectacle. When there are none left

          Isaac is panting, standing over the bronze carnage.

                          GUS

           Feel better?

          Isaac thinks about it. Shakes his head no. Gus puts his arm

          around him but looks at Hazel.

           29.

                          GUS

           That's the thing about pain... it

           demands to be felt.

          Hazel smiles. And on her face, we CUT TO:

          INT LANCASTER HOUSE - DINING ROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT

          Where Hazel is having dinner with her parents.

                          FRANNIE

           Dr. Maria called today. The PET

           Scan is set for the eighth.

          Hazel nods. This could be a source of worry but she's not

          going to think about that right now. She's upbeat. And she's

          actually eating, which her parents can't help but notice.

          Frannie and Michael look at one another, pleased.

                          FRANNIE

           I told you Support Group was a good

           idea.

          Hazel's phone buzzes. "Augustus." She looks to her parents.

                          MICHAEL

           By all means.

          EXT HAZEL'S BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

          Hazel lays on the grass in her backyard staring up at the

          stars. She rings him back and as she does SPLITSCREEN w/

          Hazel in the grass and:

          INT GUS'S BASEMENT BEDROOM - SAME

          Gus (upside down) in bed, a laptop on his chest.

                          GUS

           Hazel Grace.

                          HAZEL

           Hello Augustus.

                          GUS

           So I read it again. And I just kept

           feeling like... like it was a gift.

           Like you'd given me something

           important.

                          HAZEL

                          (TOUCHED)

           You're welcome.

                          GUS

           On the other hand... we need

           closure, don't we?

           30.

                          HAZEL

           What we need is a sequel.

                          GUS

           Yes. We need to know what happens

           to Anna's family after she dies.

                          HAZEL

           That's what I kept asking Van

           Houten for in my letters.

                          GUS

           But he never wrote back.

                          HAZEL

           That's correct.

                          GUS

           Because he's a recluse.

                          HAZEL

           Yeee-up.

                          GUS

           Utterly unreachable.

                          HAZEL

           Unfortunately so.

          Gus clears his throat, smiles. Hazel waits.

                          GUS

           "Dear Mr. Waters... I am writing to

           thank you for your electronic

           correspondence received this 6th of

           April.

          Hazel sits up. Could it be...?

                          GUS

           "I am grateful to anyone who sets

           aside the time to read my book..."

                          HAZEL

           Augustus!?

                          GUS

           I found his assistant. I emailed

           her. She must have forwarded it to

           him.

           (Hazel is stunned)

           Shall I continue?

                          HAZEL

           Keep reading, keep reading!

           31.

                          GUS

           "I am particularly indebted to you,

           sir, both for your kind words about

           `An Imperial Affliction' and for

           taking the time to tell me that the

           book, and here I quote you

           directly, `meant a great deal' to

           you."

          Hazel pays attention to every word.

                          GUS

           "To answer your question: No, I

           have not written anything else, nor

           will I. I do not feel that

           continuing to share my thoughts

           You're making this up?

                          GUS

           Hazel Grace, could I, with my

           meager intellectual capabilities,

           make up a letter from the great

           Peter Van Houten?

                          HAZEL

           Holy hell.

                          GUS

           Indeed.

                          HAZEL

           Can I... would you mind...

                          GUS

                          (SMILING)

           Go check your in-box.

          Hazel jumps up as fast as her lungs will allow. CUT TO:

          INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Hazel sits at her computer, Van Houten's assistant's email

          address staring her in the face. The cursor blinks on a blank

          page. And then Hazel starts writing...

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           "Dear Mr. Peter Van Houten, my name

           is Hazel Grace Lancaster. My friend

           Augustus Waters, who read your book

           - at my recommendation - just

           received an email from you at this

           address. I hope you will not mind

           that he shared that email with me."

           32.

          While Hazel reads the letter, we see a SERIES OF SCENES

          showing the next several days. They include:

          - Hazel and Gus drinking coffees at a cafe. He's

          enthusiastically telling a story and she's enjoying every

          moment of it.

          - Hazel helping Gus become a better driver. It's no use.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           "I was wondering if you wouldn't

           mind answering a few questions I

           have about what happens after the

           end of the book. Specifically, the

                          FOLLOWING:"

          - In his kitchen, laughing, trying to make omelettes.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           "Does Anna's Mom marry the Dutch

           Tulip Man; is the Dutch Tulip Man

           up to something - or is he just

           misunderstood? What happens to

           Anna's friends?

          - Watching TV. Their bodies almost touching. But not quite.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           Lastly, I was hoping you could shed

           some light on Sisyphus the Hamster.

           These questions have haunted me for

           years. And I don't know how long I

           have left to get answers to them."

          And finally, back in Hazel's bedroom. She finishes reading

          this letter into the phone.

                          HAZEL

           "I know these are not important

           literary questions and that your

           book is full of important literary

           questions, but I would just really

           like to know."

          INTERCUT w/ Gus bouncing a ball against the wall, listening.

                          HAZEL

           (reading it aloud to him)

           "And of course, if ever you do

           decide to write anything else, even

           if you don't want to publish it,

           I'd love to read it. Frankly, I'd

           read your grocery lists. Yours with

           great admiration, Hazel Grace

           Lancaster. Age 16."

                          GUS

           Not bad.

           33.

                          HAZEL

           You think?

                          GUS

           Bit pretentious. But then again,

           Van Houten uses words like

           "tendentious" and... "bacchanalia"

           so I think he'll like it.

          Hazel smiles, looks at a clock.

                          HAZEL

           Is it really almost 1?

                          GUS

           Guess so.

                          HAZEL

           I gotta get to sleep.

                          GUS

           Ok...

                          HAZEL

           Ok...

          Neither one of them want to hang up the phone.

                          GUS

           Ok...

                          HAZEL

           Ok...

          They both laugh at this.

                          GUS

           Perhaps "ok" will be our "always."

          Hazel smiles.

                          HAZEL

           Ok.

                          GUS

           Ok.

                          HAZEL

           Ok.

          Gus hangs up. We stay with Hazel. Is it really possible this

          Beautiful Boy likes her? She thinks about it. She's not

          convinced. CUT TO:

          INT HOSPITAL - RECOVERY ROOM - DAY

          Isaac lies in bed, bandages covering his eyes, now officially

          blind. A NURSE attends to him while Hazel sits by his side.

           34.

                          ISAAC

           She hasn't even visited. Fourteen

           months we were together. What kind

           of person...

                          ISAAC'S NURSE

           You'll get over her Isaac. Just

           takes a little time. You'll see.

          The Nurse exits the room.

                          ISAAC

           Is she gone?

                          HAZEL

           Yeah.

                          ISAAC

           Did she really just say "you'll

           see?"

                          HAZEL

           (shakes her head)

           Qualities of a Good Nurse. Go.

                          ISAAC

           Doesn't pun your disability.

                          HAZEL

           Gets blood on the first try.

                          ISAAC

           That is huge. I mean, seriously, is

           this my freakin' arm or a

           dartboard? Three - no condescending

           voice.

                          HAZEL

           (lays it on thick)

           "I'm gonna stab you with this

           needle now, so there might be a

           little ouchie."

          They laugh and then lapse into silence for a moment.

                          HAZEL

           You doing alright, Isaac?

                          ISAAC

           I don't know. To be honest, I think

           a hell of a lot more about Monica

           than my eye. Is that crazy? That's

           crazy.

                          HAZEL

           It's a little crazy.

           35.

                          ISAAC

           But I believe in love, you know? I

           don't believe that everybody gets

           to keep their eyes or not get sick

           or whatever, but everybody should

           have true love. Don't you think?

          Hazel thinks about it as Isaac presses the button on his pain

          pump, self-administering morphine.

                          ISAAC

           Gus was here earlier.

                          HAZEL

           (trying to be nonchalant)

           Was he?

          Isaac exhales as the pain pump starts to kick in.

                          ISAAC

           Mmm... that's better.

                          HAZEL

           The pain?

           (off his slow nod)

           Good. Good, Isaac.

           (Isaac closes his eyes)

           What about Gus?

          But Isaac is already asleep. Whatever he was going to say

          about Gus is gone. Hazel nods, pats his hand. CUT TO:

          INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - MORNING

          Hazel rolls out of bed, stumbles to her computer. She

          casually checks her in-box and is shocked to discover - he's

          written her back!

                          HAZEL

           Holy shit!

           you, I barely know you."

          Hazel's jaw hangs open as she reads the next part:

                          HAZEL

           "Should ever you find yourself in

           Amsterdam, do pay a visit at your

           leisure. Yours most sincerely,

           Peter Van Houten" Son of a - WHAT

           IS THIS LIFE!!!

           36.

          Frannie races in, clearly expecting a health problem.

                          FRANNIE

           What's wrong?!

                          HAZEL

           (realizing she scared her)

           Nothing. Sorry.

                          FRANNIE

                          (CONFUSED)

           Nothing?

                          HAZEL

           Everything! Look!

          Hazel shows Frannie the note. Frannie reads it.

                          HAZEL

           Can we go to Amsterdam? Please?

          Frannie thinks about how to respond for a beat.

                          FRANNIE

           Hazel, I... I love you and... you

           know I'd do anything for you, but

           we don't...

                          (PAINED)

           We don't have the money. The

           expense of getting equipment over

           there - love, it's just not

           possible...

                          HAZEL

                          (DEFLATES)

           No, yeah, of course.

          Clearly Frannie feels awful. Which makes Hazel feel awful.

                          FRANNIE

           I mean, I could talk to your father

                          OR --

                          HAZEL

           Mom, no. Please. Don't do anything.

           Forget I mentioned it.

          A beat between them. Frannie walks out, sadly. Hazel sits on

          the bed, totally bummed now for two reasons.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           Guilt is definitely a side effect

           of cancer.

          EXT SUBURBAN STREET - LATER

          Hazel and Gus walk together on the sidewalk.

           37.

                          GUS

           Just use your wish.

                          HAZEL

           I've used it already. Pre-

           "Miracle."

                          GUS

           What'd you do?

          Hazel doesn't want to say. Gus realizes.

                          GUS

           Not Disney.

                          HAZEL

           I was 13...

                          GUS

           Tell me you did not go to Disney

           World.

           (Hazel looks away)

           Hazel Grace! You did not use your

           one dying Wish to go to Disney

           World!

                          HAZEL

                          (FEEBLE)

           And Epcot Center.

                          GUS

           (hands in the air)

           Oh my God!

                          HAZEL

                          (DEFENDING HERSELF)

           We had fun on that trip.

                          GUS

           That is the saddest thing I've ever

           heard!

                          HAZEL

           I met Goofy...

                          GUS

           Now I'm embarrassed.

                          HAZEL

           Why are you embarrassed?

                          GUS

           How can I have a crush on a girl

           with such cliche wishes?

                          HAZEL

           Wait, what?

          The word "crush" has taken Hazel totally by surprise.

           38.

                          GUS

           What?

          She looks at him. A beat. She quickly looks away, blushing.

          Gus continues on about Disney but all Hazel can think about

          is "CRUSH". She tries not to seem too excited. CUT TO:

          INT PET SCAN ROOM - DAY

          Hazel, in a hospital gown, is slowly fed through the machine.

          A TECH explains that she should hold still, try and relax,

          etc. But Hazel knows. She knows all about these procedures.

          She's a pro. CUT TO:

          EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - FRONT

          Gus is waiting on the front stoop when Frannie's car pulls

          up. They're home from the hospital.

          He wears an Indiana Pacers JERSEY and carries a bouquet of

          bright orange TULIPS.

          Michael gets out of the passenger's seat to help Hazel out of

          the car. Gus rises to assist them.

                          MICHAEL

           Is that a Rik Smits jersey?

                          GUS

           It is indeed.

                          MICHAEL

                          (BEAT)

           Man, I loved that guy.

          Hazel sees Gus, wasn't expecting him.

                          HAZEL

           Gus?

                          GUS

           Hi Hazel.

                          (BEAT)

           How would you like to go on a

           picnic?

          INT HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Gus is with Frannie and Michael downstairs.

                          FRANNIE

           Something to drink?

                          GUS

           I'm great Mrs. Lancaster.

           39.

          Meanwhile, upstairs, Hazel gets ready for the date. She's put

          the orange flowers in a toothbrush holder and is putting on

          LIP GLOSS. She can faintly hear the conversation downstairs.

          ANGLE ON Gus sitting on the stairs. Michael next to him.

                          MICHAEL

           You're a survivor yourself?

                          GUS

           (taps his leg)

           Didn't cut this fella off for the

           hell of it. Though it is an

           excellent weight-loss strategy.

           Legs are heavy!

                          MICHAEL

           How's your health now?

                          GUS

           N-E-C for fourteen months.

                          MICHAEL

           That's fantastic.

                          GUS

           I'm very lucky.

          ANGLE ON Hazel, checking herself out in the mirror. Seems to

          like what she sees a lot more than before.

          BACK ON Gus and Michael, downstairs:

                          MICHAEL

           Son, you have to understand...

           Hazel's still pretty sick. She will

           be the rest of her life.

          ANGLE on Hazel, who can hear all of this. She stops what

          she's doing and listens.

                          MICHAEL

           She'll want to keep up with you -

           she's that kind of girl - but the

           truth is, her lungs --

                          HAZEL

           You ready Gus?

          Hazel appears, silencing her Father mid-sentence. CUT TO:

          EXT PARK - LATER

          Behind the Indianapolis Museum of Art is 152 Acres of Gardens

          and Grounds. Hazel and Gus walk together.

                          HAZEL

           Is this where you bring all your

           romantic conquests?

           40.

                          GUS

           Every last one.

                          (BEAT)

           Probably why I'm still a virgin.

          Hazel laughs, elbows him.

                          HAZEL

           You're not a virgin.

           (off his look)

           Are you really?

          Gus picks a STICK up from the dirt. Draws a BIG CIRCLE in it.

                          GUS

           See this? This circle is virgins...

          Now Gus draws a much smaller circle inside that circle.

                          GUS

           And this... is 17 year old dudes

           with one leg.

          Hazel laughs. Point made. He grabs her hand, helps her walk

          up a tiny hill. Once up there, Gus lays a blanket on the

          ground. They sit, looking out over a rather odd SCULPTURE - a

          set of GIANT WHITE BONES where children can jump and play.

                          GUS

                          (EXPLAINING)

           "Funky Bones" by Joep Van Lieshout.

                          HAZEL

           He sounds Dutch.

                          GUS

           And he is. Much like Rik Smits. And

           tulips.

          Hazel raises an eyebrow at Gus. He's sure taking this

          Amsterdam/Dutch thing pretty far. He removes some sandwiches

          and orange juice out of a basket.

                          GUS

           Sandwich?

                          HAZEL

           Let me guess --

                          GUS

                          (NODS)

           Dutch cheese. And tomato.

           (she takes one)

           The tomatoes are Mexican. Sorry.

          They eat for a second, their eyes watching the children play

          on the bones.

           41.

                          GUS

           How cool is that? A skeleton being

           used as a playground.

                          HAZEL

           You do love your symbols.

                          GUS

           Speaking of which...

          Gus stands up, takes a cigarette, puts it in his mouth. He

          clears his throat.

                          GUS

           You're probably wondering why

           you're sitting here eating a bad

           cheese sandwich and drinking orange

           juice with a guy in a Rik Smits

           jersey.

                          HAZEL

           It has crossed my mind.

                          GUS

           Hazel Grace, like so many before

           you - and I say this with great

           affection - you spent your Wish...

           moronically.

                          HAZEL

           I was thir--

                          GUS

           Hush! I'm in the midst of a grand

           soliloquy here.

                          HAZEL

           Sorry. Please, continue...

                          GUS

           You were young. Impressionable. The

           Grim Reaper staring you in the

           face. And the fear of dying with

           your one true Wish left ungranted

           led you to rush into making one you

           didn't really want, for how could

           little Hazel Grace, having never

           read "An Imperial Affliction" ever

           know that her one TRUE wish was to

           visit Mr. Peter Van Houten in his

           Amsterdamian exile.

          Hazel nods in agreement.

                          GUS

           If you were smart, you would have

           saved your wish til the time in

           your life when you really knew your

           true self.

           42.

          Gus stops talking. Hazel is confused.

                          HAZEL

           But I... didn't save it.

          Gus smiles.

                          GUS

           Good thing I saved mine.

          Hazel cocks her head to one side. What is he talking about?

                          GUS

           Got it in exchange for the leg.

                          (BEAT)

           And I still have it.

          She starts to realize.

                          HAZEL

           Are you saying --

                          GUS

           I'm not gonna give you my Wish or

           anything. But I too have an

           interest in meeting Peter Van

           Houten and it wouldn't make much

           sense to meet him without the girl

           who introduced me to his book, now

           would it?

           (Hazel's eyes widen)

           I talked to the Genies and they're

           in total agreement.

                          (BEAT)

           We leave on May third.

          Hazel is so excited that she grabs Gus and pulls him into a

          hug. Their faces close, lips inches apart, and just when it

          looks like something might happen --

                          HAZEL

           Wait a minute.

                          (BEAT)

           Are you only doing this so I'll

           kiss you?

          A beat. Gus blinks a few times.

                          HAZEL

           Cause I'd totally kiss you either

           way.

          And kiss him she does. He's surprised. And when it's over,

          they sit back, look at one another. A magic moment.

                          HAZEL

           Seriously... why are you doing

           this?

           43.

                          GUS

           Because Hazel Grace... I found my

           Wish.

          And Hazel is beyond touched. We hear:

                          FRANNIE (OVERLAP)

           Are you out of your mind?

          INT HAZEL'S UTILITY ROOM - DAY

          Frannie folds laundry while Hazel pleads her case.

                          FRANNIE

           It's too much, Haze. We can't

           accept something like that from a

           virtual stranger.

                          HAZEL

           He's not a stranger.

                          FRANNIE

           Really?

                          HAZEL

           Don't be gross.

                          FRANNIE

           It's still "no," I'm afraid.

                          HAZEL

           Can we at least ask Dr. Maria?

          INT DOCTOR'S OFFICE - ANOTHER DAY

          Where Hazel's oncologist DR. MARIA shakes her head.

           DR. MARIA

           That's out of the question.

                          HAZEL

           You said the PET scan was

           encouraging!

           DR. MARIA

           The PET scan is encouraging. We

           just don't know how long it'll stay

           that way. What if you get sick in a

           foreign country?

                          HAZEL

           They have doctors in Amsterdam. And

           cancer. Someone will know what to

           do.

           44.

           DR. MARIA

           Be that as it may, without someone

           familiar with your particular case,

           I can't --

                          HAZEL

           (turns to her Mom)

           So you'll come too.

                          FRANNIE

           What?

                          HAZEL

           The Genies can hook it up. They're

           loaded.

                          FRANNIE

                          I --

                          HAZEL

           You've never been to Amsterdam,

           have you Mom?

          And judging from her face, seems she'd kinda like to. Dr.

          Maria looks at Frannie, shrugs - kid's got a point.

          Hazel smiles. And on that smile, we SMASH CUT TO:

           BLACK.

          Over which, we HEAR:

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           And then this happened.

          INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          [Note: There's no sound in this sequence. Just images.]

          Hazel wakes up screaming in the middle of the night, shaking

          and holding her head.

          Frannie and Michael burst in. Mom grabs her crying daughter,

          frightened beyond belief, waves to Michael to call for help.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           People talk about the courage of

           cancer patients. And I do not deny

           that courage...

          He leaves the room to do so and Fran stays behind, rocking

          with her daughter, promising her it'll all be ok. Whatever

          nightmare this is, it's going to end. CUT TO:

          INT FRANNIE'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

          Still silent. Michael drives, trying to keep it together.

          Frannie's in the back with Hazel's head in her lap.

           45.

          Hazel continues to scream in silence, whether from pain or

          terror, we do not know.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           I'd been poked and stabbed and

           poisoned for years and still I trod

           on.

          INT EMERGENCY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Michael carries Hazel into the chaotic emergency room.

          They're practically running. There's still no sound.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           But make no mistake...

          The doctors rally to assist the screaming, crying child.

          She's wheeled away from her family who can only watch. We

          stay with her and WE HEAR:

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           In that moment I would have been

           very, very happy to die.

          END SEQUENCE.

          INT HOSPITAL ROOM - ICU - MORNING

          The sound returns. And it's the sound of a heart monitor.

          BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. It's also the sound of a working heart.

          Hazel has made it through. Her eyes open. A NURSE is there.

                          HAZEL'S NURSE

           Hello.

                          HAZEL

           Hi.

                          HAZEL'S NURSE

           You're ok, Hazel.

          Even Hazel seems surprised by that.

                          HAZEL'S NURSE

           Would you like to see your parents?

          Hazel nods. The Nurse goes to get them. Soon they come

          bounding in, crying and kissing her repeatedly. So much

          relief. CUT TO:

          LATER. Hazel's bed has been raised up so she can talk to her

          parents "comfortably."

                          FRANNIE

           They thought it was a brain tumor.

                          MICHAEL

           It wasn't - thank god --

           46.

                          HAZEL

           So what happened?

                          FRANNIE

           The usual. Fluid in the lungs,

           preventing oxygenation. They put

           that in...

          There's a TUBE in Hazel's side draining fluid into a plastic

          bladder that hangs off her bed.

                          FRANNIE

           Drained a liter and a half last

           night.

          (That's a lot of fluid.)

                          MICHAEL

           The good news is... no tumor

           growth. No new tumors in your body.

          Hazel nods. That is a relief.

                          MICHAEL

           We're all so relieved.

          Frannie embraces her daughter.

                          FRANNIE

           This is just a thing Hazel. It's a

           thing we can live with.

          Hazel nods again. Only in the universe of Hazel Grace

          Lancaster is something like this just a thing. Meanwhile:

          INT HOSPITAL ICU - WAITING AREA - LATER

          Here's Gus, his foot tapping nervously on the floor. It's

          unclear how long he's been waiting there. He sees Michael

          walk down the hall. Races after him.

                          GUS

           Mr. Lancaster! How's she doing?

                          MICHAEL

           Better, thank you. Much better.

          Gus nods, as relieved as the rest of them.

                          GUS

           They won't let me in. Family only.

                          MICHAEL

           I'm sorry --

                          GUS

           No I get it. Will you just... will

           you tell her I was here?

           47.

                          MICHAEL

           Of course I will.

          Gus smiles. And sits back down. Though he won't get to see

          her, he still wants to stay.

                          MICHAEL

           Gus.

          Michael really likes this kid.

                          MICHAEL

           Why don't you go home, get some

           rest?

          Gus looks up. That might be for the best. CUT TO:

          INT HOSPITAL - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAYS LATER

          Hazel and her Parents sit at a very large conference table

          along with Dr. Maria and THREE OTHER ONCOLOGISTS - her whole

          "Cancer Team."

                          ONCOLOGIST #1

           The great news is... Phalanxifor

           continues to control your tumor

           growth.

                          (BEAT)

           The not so great news is we're

           still seeing serious problems with

           fluid accumulation.

                          (BEAT)

           So how should we proceed?

          Silence. Hazel looks around the room, waits for someone to

          answer. No one does.

                          HAZEL

           Um, I feel like I'm not the most

           qualified person to answer that.

                          ONCOLOGIST #1

           I was talking to Dr. Simmons.

          DR. SIMMONS (late 60s, white beard, old school) speaks next.

           DR. SIMMONS

           It's a strange case. Normally the

           tumors start resisting the

           treatment. But that hasn't happened

           here - yet.

          Hazel hears the "yet" the loudest.

           DR. SIMMONS

           Unfortunately, the drug may be

           worsening the edema.

           48.

           DR. MARIA

           But if we stopped it entirely,

           we're likely to face even graver

           dangers.

                          MICHAEL

           So we're gonna do nothing?

           DR. MARIA

           That's what we have to decide. The

           truth is... very few people have

           been on Phalanxifor as long as

           Hazel has. We don't really know the

           long term effects.

          That comforts no one.

                          HAZEL

           Can't I just get like a lung

           transplant or something?

          The Doctors look at one another like "who wants to take that

          one?" Eventually:

           DR. MARIA

           You would not be considered a...

           strong candidate for a transplant.

          Hazel takes that in, nods, tries to pretend it didn't bother

          her. Sensitive Michael on the other hand starts to cry a

          little bit. He grabs Frannie's hand.

           DR. SIMMONS

           We're trying to prevent endothelial

           growth while at the same time

           preventing immunosorbent...

          As Dr. Simmons drones on with some cancer gobbledygook,

          Hazel's eyes remain firmly fixed on her parents. She hates

          what she's doing to them. And seeing them holding hands,

          crying but trying not to cry - it jogs a memory. CUT TO:

          INT HOSPITAL ICU - FLASHBACK

          We saw this once before. It looks like the end for 13-year

          old Hazel. Her father is weeping off to the side while her

          mom stands over her, holding her hand, and asking:

                          FRANNIE

           (through the tears)

           Are you ready, sweetie?

          13-year old Hazel nods. The doctors get to work. The

          anaesthetic takes hold and Hazel goes under. But not enough.

          Cause she totally hears her mother say:

                          FRANNIE

           I won't be a mom anymore.

           49.

          She falls into her husband's chest. And we're BACK TO:

          INT HOSPITAL - CONFERENCE ROOM

          Hazel comes out of the memory when her parents see her

          staring at them. She tries to shake it off. Dr. Simmons is

          still talking nonsense when:

                          HAZEL

           I have a question.

           DR. MARIA

           Yes Hazel.

                          HAZEL

           Can I still go to Amsterdam?

          Dr. Simmons can't help himself. He laughs. Everyone looks at

          him. He clears his throat.

           DR. SIMMONS

           That would not be wise at this

           juncture.

                          HAZEL

           Why not?

           DR. SIMMONS

           Excuse me?

                          HAZEL

           Why not, Dr. Simmons?

           DR. SIMMONS

                          I --

          The doctors are trying to be delicate here.

           DR. MARIA

           It would... increase some risks --

                          HAZEL

           So does going to the mall --

           DR. MARIA

           Yes but an airplane?

                          HAZEL

           They have oxygen on airplanes.

                          FRANNIE

                          HAZEL --

                          HAZEL

           It's my life, right?

           DR. SIMMONS

           You're Stage IV --

           50.

                          HAZEL

           I have this opportunity I may never

           have again. If the medicine's

           working, I don't see why --

           DR. SIMMONS

           Because, Hazel.

                          (BEAT)

           Look, I don't know any other way to

           say this... You're just too sick.

          And this is like a punch in the gut.

           DR. SIMMONS

           I'm sorry.

          Everyone feels horrible now. Dr. Maria, Frannie and Michael,

          and even Hazel. This meeting couldn't have gone worse. And we

                         CUT TO:

          EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY

          Hazel parent's bring her home from the hospital. She looks

          miserable. It's clear the last few days have been a big

          emotional set back. CUT TO:

          INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - LATER

          Her parents tuck her in.

                          FRANNIE

           We'll be right outside.

          Hazel nods. Her phone buzzes. She looks at it. A text from

          Gus that reads: "ok?" Hazel looks at it.

          And she doesn't write back. CUT TO:

          INT HAZEL'S KITCHEN - ANOTHER NIGHT

          Hazel sits staring at nothing. The house phone rings. Michael

          comes in from another room with the phone in hand. Whispers:

                          MICHAEL

           Gus again.

          Hazel thinks about it - silently shakes her head, no. Michael

          says into the phone.

                          MICHAEL

           I'm sorry Gus, she's asleep.

          Hazel stands and goes into her bedroom, clearly depressed.

           51.

          INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - LATER

          Hazel reads from "An Imperial Affliction." Her phone buzzes

          again. "Augustus." It just says "hello?" Again she ignores

          it.

          And then a second text. She looks at it. "The silence is

          deafening." She puts the phone back down.

          Hazel's heart breaks. She can't take it anymore. She picks

          the phone back up. She texts the following:

          "I don't know if you'll understand this but I can't see you

          anymore. I mean I want to. I just..."

          She thinks about the rest. She writes:

          "I'm a grenade."

          She sends the text. Waits.

          And then there's more to say. She sends a second text.

          "When I look at you, all I can see is what I'm going to put

          you through. I can't have that. I'm sorry."

          She sends that text. Waits.

          He writes back.

          "Ok."

          Hazel reads it. Writes back: "Ok."

          A beat. Gus responds: "oh my god, stop flirting with me!"

          Hazel smiles - she can't help herself! - but she must. She

          gets her emotions in check. Puts the phone away. CUT TO:

          EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - ESTABLISHING

          An ugly day in Indianapolis.

          INT HAZEL'S HOUSE - SAME

          Inside, Hazel is about as miserable as the weather. The sky -

          and the circumstances - have cast a grey pall over the day.

          EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - BACKYARD

          Hazel walks out back. Looks up at the clouds, threatening

          rain but not yet delivering it. She sits down in the grass,

          on the verge of tears. She looks at the old rusty SWING SET

          that's been in her backyard for years.

           52.

          And starts to cry. Just for a few brief moments, she lets

          herself cry.

          Then she wipes the tears. Becomes strong again. And makes a

          decision.

          Hazel dials her phone. We hear:

           GUS (O.S.)

           Hazel Grace!

                          HAZEL

           Hi Augustus.

           GUS (O.S.)

           Are you crying, Hazel Grace?

                          HAZEL

           Kind of.

           GUS (O.S.)

           What's the matter?

                          HAZEL

           I don't know. I want to go to

           Amsterdam. And I want him to tell

           us what happens after the book and

           I don't want my particular life and

           also the sky is making me sad and

           there's this old swing set that my

           Dad made for me when I was a kid.

           It's just... everything.

          Hazel is on the verge of losing it again. A few beats of

          silence pass by.

           GUS (O.S.)

           I demand to see this swing set of

           tears.

          Hazel can't help but smile and we CUT TO:

          LATER. Same backyard - only now Hazel is with Gus. Which

          makes everything better.

          They both look at the swing set.

                          GUS

           I see your point.

                          (BEAT)

           That is one sad swing set.

          Hazel nudges her head onto his shoulder.

                          HAZEL

           Thanks for coming over.

           53.

                          GUS

           You do realize... trying to keep

           your distance from me will in no

           way lessen my affection for you.

          Hazel says nothing.

                          GUS

           All efforts to save me from you

           will fail.

          Hazel looks at him. He's sure not making this easy.

                          GUS

           Is this about Amsterdam? Cause we

                          DON'T --

                          HAZEL

           It's not about Amsterdam. It's

           about me. It's about...

                          GUS

           Grenades.

          Hazel nods.

                          GUS

           I get it. One day you're going to

           explode in a huge ball of fire and

           everyone close to you will die in

           your wake.

                          HAZEL

           Exactly.

                          GUS

           There's already two people in your

           life you're going to destroy. Why

           add a third to that list. Am I

           right?

                          HAZEL

                          (NODS)

           That's why I don't have a hamster.

          Gus is silent. He can't argue. They stand there quietly a few

          more beats, looking out at the swing set. Until:

                          GUS

           We have got to do something about

           this frigging swing set.

          INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Hazel sits at the computer screen writing a Craigslist post.

          Gus stands next to her.

           54.

                          HAZEL

                          (TYPING)

           "Swing Set Needs Home."

                          GUS

           "Desperately Lonely Swing Set Needs

           Loving Home."

                          HAZEL

           "Lonely, Vaguely Pedophilic Swing

           Set Seeks Butts of Children."

          Gus laughs.

                          HAZEL

           No?

          Gus laughs harder. Hazel laughs with him.

                          GUS

           That's why.

          Hazel looks at him, not understanding.

                          GUS

           In case you were wondering...

           that's why I like you.

           (beat, off her look)

           You're so busy being you that you

           have no idea how utterly

           unprecedented you are.

          Hazel absorbs that. Her feelings for this boy in a tangle.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - BACKYARD

          Gus and Hazel watch as a TOWNIE finishes loading the swing

          set into the back of his PICK-UP. Gus salutes the swing set

          as the truck drives off.

          Then he sneaks a quick kiss on Hazel's cheek. She shoots him

          a look. Gus throws up his hands.

                          GUS

           Friendly.

          She playfully elbows him away.

          EXT CHURCH - ANOTHER DAY

          Hazel walks with Isaac out of Support Group.

                          ISAAC

           Do you like him?

                          HAZEL

           Of course I like him.

           55.

                          ISAAC

           But you don't want to hook up with

           him?

          Hazel doesn't know what she wants.

                          HAZEL

           It's complicated.

          INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - DAY

          Hazel is at her computer reading a new email from Lidewij

          Vliegenthart. Clearly Hazel was not expecting this.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           "Dear Hazel, I have received word

           via the Genies that you will be

           visiting us with Augustus Waters

           and your mother beginning on the

           4th. A week away! Peter and I are

           delighted and cannot wait to --

          Hazel is confused. She stands and walks into the hallway.

                          HAZEL

           Mom?

          No response.

                          HAZEL

           Mom!

                          (STILL NOTHING)

           MOM!!!

          Frannie races out of her room in a towel, dripping wet.

                          FRANNIE

           What is it, what's wrong?!

                          HAZEL

           Sorry, I... I didn't know you were

           in the shower.

                          FRANNIE

                          (EXHAUSTED)

           Bath. I was just... just trying to

           take a bath for five seconds.

           What's the matter?

                          HAZEL

           Did you ever call the Genies to

           tell them the trip is off? I just

           got an email from Peter Van

           Houton's assistant. She still

           thinks we're coming.

          Frannie purses her lips and squints past Hazel. Clearly

          unsure what to say.

           56.

                          HAZEL

           What?

          Frannie can't keep a straight face.

                          FRANNIE

           I'm not supposed to tell you until

           your father gets home.

                          (BEAT)

           We're going to Amsterdam.

                          HAZEL

           (still not believing)

           Really...

                          FRANNIE

           Dr. Maria called last night and

           made a convincing case that you

           need to live --

                          HAZEL

                          (YELLING)

           I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!!

          Hazel can't move all that fast to hug her Mom so Frannie

          comes to her and they embrace. After:

                          FRANNIE

           I'm getting back in the tub now.

          When she leaves Hazel grabs her cell phone. ANGLE ON IT.

          Hazel sends Gus the following text: "STILL FREE MAY 3? :-)"

          A moment later Gus responds: "EVERYTHING'S COMING UP WATERS!"

          Hazel is over the moon with excitement. She smiles, then

          tries to calm herself, knowing it's the best thing.

                          HAZEL

           (whispering to her lungs)

           One week, lungs. Keep your shit

           together one more week...

          INT KITCHEN - ONE WEEK LATER

          Luggage waits by the door, including oxygen tanks and medical

          equipment. Frannie makes breakfast as Hazel enters, now

          dressed and excited for the trip.

                          HAZEL

           Amsterdam!

                          FRANNIE

           Amsterdam!

          And a moment later Michael joins them.

           57.

                          MICHAEL

           Amsterdam!

          They're all going crazy with excitement! CUT TO:

          EXT HOUSE - LATER

          Michael finishes loading up the car. Kisses his wife goodbye.

          He embraces Hazel. She hugs him back and of course he starts

          to cry.

                          MICHAEL

                          (WHISPERING)

           I love you. I'm so proud of you.

                          HAZEL

           For what?

          Michael lets go of her and wipes away his tears. They look at

          each other. Unable to help himself, he grabs her for another

          hug. Hazel lets him, laughing.

          INT / EXT CAR - LATER

          The car is packed with oxygen tanks, a suitcase for clothes,

          another for medicines and back-up medicines just in case etc.

          Frannie pulls up to Gus's house. They get out of the car and

          head to the front door, buzzing with excitement.

          As they get close, they can hear a commotion inside. A

          WOMAN'S VOICE yelling something unclear, followed by:

           GUS (O.S.)

           BECAUSE IT'S MY LIFE, MOM. IT

           BELONGS TO ME!

          Frannie immediately puts her arm around Hazel and quickly

          spins her back to the car.

                          HAZEL

           Mom?

                          FRANNIE

           We can't eavesdrop, Hazel.

          Back at the car, far out of earshot, they wait. Hazel unsure

          what that was about. Frannie politely honks the horn.

          A moment later Gus emerges from the house, smiling. A travel

          bag over his shoulder and a cigarette dangling from his lips.

                          GUS

                          (TO FRANNIE)

           Always a pleasure to see you ma'am.

                          (BEAT)

           Hello, Hazel Grace.

           58.

                          HAZEL

           Ok...?

                          GUS

           Ok.

                          HAZEL

           Ok.

          Frannie doesn't know what to make of any of that. She just

          says, when they stop and look at her:

                          FRANNIE

           Amsterdam!

          EXT AIRPORT - ESTABLISHING

          A SKYCAP helps Hazel, Gus and Frannie with all their bags and

          equipment.

          INT AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER

          They wait in line for the security checkpoint. When it's

          Hazel's turn she unhooks the plastic nubbins from her nose.

          Gus places the oxygen tank on the conveyer belt.

          Hazel takes slow, careful steps through the metal detector.

          She seems determined to get through this without any help.

          But upon reaching the other side it's clear that even these

          few steps without oxygen were a struggle.

          Hazel holds on to the side of the conveyer belt to steady

          herself. As soon as her tank reappears she puts the cannula

          back in place. Still light-headed, Hazel closes her eyes and

          focuses on her breathing. She catches her mom looking at her,

          nervously.

                          HAZEL

           (with some difficulty)

           Amsterdam!

          INT AIRPORT GATE - LATER

          Arriving at the Gate area they draw curious looks from the

          OTHER PASSENGERS: Hazel with her oxygen tank, Gus with his

          noticeable limp and Frannie helping with the equipment.

          A YOUNG COUPLE gets up so that Hazel and Gus can sit.

                          HAZEL

           Oh that's not necessary.

          But they give up their seats anyway. Hazel and Gus take them.

          We see various Passengers watching. Hazel ignores the

          attention until a LITTLE GIRL (6, cute braids) appears.

           59.

                          LITTLE GIRL

           What's in your nose?

                          HAZEL

           It's called a Cannula. These tubes

           give me oxygen and help me breathe.

          The GIRL'S MOTHER swoops in, a little frantic.

                          GIRL'S MOTHER

           Jackie... Oh, I'm sorry.

                          HAZEL

                          (SINCERE)

           No, no. It's alright.

                          LITTLE GIRL

           Would they help me breathe too?

                          HAZEL

           I dunno. Wanna try?

          Hazel removes her cannula and let's the Little Girl try it.

                          LITTLE GIRL

           Tickles.

                          HAZEL

           Right?

                          LITTLE GIRL

           I think I'm breathing better.

                          HAZEL

           Well... I'd love to give you my

           cannula but... I kinda really need

           the help.

          The Little Girl nods, hands it back to Hazel, who quickly

          reattaches it.

                          LITTLE GIRL

           Thanks for letting me try it.

          They smile at each other before the Little Girl walks back to

          her family. She waves. Hazel waves back.

           AIRPORT ANNOUNCEMENT (O.S.)

           We will now begin pre-boarding

           Flight 144 to Amsterdam. For those

           passengers in need of extra

           assistance...

                          HAZEL

           I think that's us.

           60.

          INT AIRPLANE - MOMENTS LATER

          Hazel sits in the middle with Frannie on the aisle and Gus at

          the window. He looks around, antsy.

                          HAZEL

           Have you never been on a plane

           before?

          Gus shakes his head, he has not. And he's nervous. He pulls a

          cigarette out of his pocket and puts it in his mouth. Within

          seconds a FLIGHT ATTENDANT rushes over.

                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT

           Sir, you can't smoke on this plane.

           Or... any plane.

                          GUS

           (cigarette in his mouth)

           I don't smoke.

          The Flight Attendant shoots him a look.

                          HAZEL

           It's a metaphor. He puts the

           killing thing in his mouth but

           doesn't give it the power to kill

           him.

                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT

                          (NO NONSENSE)

           That metaphor is prohibited on

           today's flight.

          Gus nods and puts the cigarette away.

                          PA SYSTEM

           "Flight attendants, prepare for

           departure."

          The engines roar to life and the plane accelerates towards

          take off. Gus is getting more worried by the second. He grabs

          the arm rest, his eyes wide.

                          HAZEL

           Ok?

          Gus doesn't say it back. Hazel laughs.

                          HAZEL

           This is what it feels like to ride

           in a car with you.

          Gus grabs Hazel's hand as the plane lifts off. He looks out

          the window - they're flying! - and then back to Hazel.

                          GUS

           We're flying! Look!

          Hazel smiles at his enthusiasm.

           61.

                          GUS

           Holy -- look at that?! NOTHING HAS

           EVER LOOKED LIKE THAT EVER IN ALL

           OF HUMAN HISTORY!

          He's adorable at this moment. Hazel can't resist leaning over

          to give him a kiss on the cheek.

                          FRANNIE

           (not looking up from her

                          MAGAZINE)

           Just so you know, I'm right here.

           Sitting next to you. Your mother.

                          HAZEL

           We're just friends, Mom.

                          GUS

           She is. I'm not.

          Hazel shoots him a look. Gus shrugs - "what, it's the truth."

          Hazel just shakes her head. CUT TO:

          LATER. Mid-flight, the plane is dark, Frannie's asleep. Hazel

          and Gus watch the same gory action movie. Actually, he

          watches the movie. She just watches him watch it. He watches

          it with gusto.

          Hazel continues to watch him. Try as she might, she's falling

          in love. CUT TO:

          SFX: the PLANE touching down. CUT TO:

          EXT/ INT AMSTERDAM HIGHWAY - TAXI CAB - MORNING

          Hazel, Gus, and Frannie ride in the back of a YELLOW CAB.

                          CAB DRIVER

           Americans?

                          FRANNIE

           We're from Indiana.

                          CAB DRIVER

           Indiana. They steal from the

           Indians but the keep the name, yes?

          Hazel and Gus share a look.

                          HAZEL

           Something like that.

          Meanwhile, the landscape outside is flat and dusty, with dirt

          tracks and the occasional concrete building. In other words,

          it looks more like Indianapolis than Holland.

                          HAZEL

           (to the Driver)

           This is Amsterdam?

           62.

                          CAB DRIVER

           Yes and no. Amsterdam is like the

           rings of a tree. It gets older as

           you get closer to the center.

          Soon enough, the cab takes an off-ramp and turns a corner and

          suddenly, it's as if they're transported - not only to

          another universe but to another time as well.

          We see MULTI-COLORED ROW HOUSES lined on both sides of a

          windy CANAL. HOUSEBOATS float against the edges and everyone

          rides BICYCLES down cobblestone streets. They're astounded.

          INT HOTEL - LATER

          Gus helps Hazel and Frannie bring their stuff into the room.

          We see a WICKER BASKET of gifts - presents from the Genies -

          welcoming their arrival. Hazel, exhausted, sits on the bed.

                          GUS

           I'll be right down the hall.

          Hazel nods, already drifting off to sleep. CUT TO:

          INT HOTEL ROOM - HOURS LATER

          Some time later. Hazel stirs. Her Mom is seated in a sagging,

          paisley CHAIR across from the bed reading a TRAVEL GUIDE.

                          HAZEL

           Good morning.

                          FRANNIE

           Actually, it's five o'clock.

                          HAZEL

           How was the park?

                          FRANNIE

           Never made it.

                          HAZEL

           Mom!

                          FRANNIE

           What? I like watching you sleep.

          Hazel shoots Frannie a look. Even in an exotic city, her Mom

          still can't enjoy herself.

                          FRANNIE

           I promise I'll do crazy Mom stuff

           tonight while you and Gus are at

           dinner.

                          HAZEL

           What do you mean?

           63.

                          FRANNIE

           You have reservations at a place

           called Oranjee. Mr. Van Houten set

           it up. Very fancy according to the

           Book. And romantic.

                          HAZEL

           Mom...

                          FRANNIE

           I'm just saying...

                          HAZEL

           A 16 year old girl running free

           with an older boy on the streets of

           a foreign city famous for its vice

           and debauchery... is totally cool

           with you. Is that what you're

           saying?

                          FRANNIE

           (beat, excited)

           Let's get you dressed!

          Hazel just shakes her head. CUT TO:

          INT HOTEL ROOM - LATER

          Frannie opens the door to find Gus in a perfectly tailored

          BLACK SUIT, cigarette dangling from his mouth.

                          FRANNIE

           (calling to the bathroom)

           Hazel! Gus is here.

                          (TO GUS)

           Looking sharp.

                          GUS

           Thank you ma'am.

          A few beats later Hazel emerges from the bathroom. She wears

          a knee-length, pale blue SUNDRESS. And she looks...

                          GUS

           Wow.

                          HAZEL

           I...

                          (BEAT)

           Am I under-dressed?

                          GUS

           You look gorgeous.

          Gus offers Hazel his arm. She takes it. They're ready to go.

           64.

          INT/EXT AMSTERDAM - ON THE TRAM - LATER

          Hazel and Gus ride the crowded tram through the city. ELM

          TREES line the canals, their pale petals blowing into the

          wind like a spring snowstorm.

          An OLD COUPLE stands to give up their seats - this happens

          all the time. Hazel again tries to protest and again it falls

          on deaf ears. She and Gus sit. They look out the window onto

          the city. Excited. The night just beginning.

          EXT ORANJEE RESTAURANT - LATER

          At the edge of the canal, near an ancient bridge. Hazel and

          Gus are shown to a TABLE right next to the water.

                          HOSTESS

           Your table, Mr. And Mrs. Waters.

          Gus pulls out Hazel's chair for her. A WAITER brings them a

          bottle of CHAMPAGNE as they sit.

                          HOSTESS

           The champagne is our gift.

          Hazel and Gus look at each other. Is this a dream? The

          champagne is poured and Gus raises his glass.

                          GUS

           Ok.

          Hazel raises hers.

                          HAZEL

           Ok.

          They clink glasses and sip.

                          HAZEL

           Wow that's good.

                          WAITER

           Do you know what Dom Perignon said

           after he invented champagne?

                          (BEAT)

           `Come quickly,' he said. `I am

           tasting the stars!'

          Hazel and Gus smile.

                          WAITER

           Welcome to Oranjee. Would you like

           a menu or will you have the chef's

           choice?

          Gus looks at Hazel. She shrugs.

           65.

                          GUS

           The chef's choice sounds lovely.

           (the Waiter nods)

           And can we get more of this?

                          WAITER

           We have bottled all the stars for

           you this evening, my young friends.

          The Waiter leaves. Hazel and Gus look at each other.

                          GUS

           Thank you for coming to Amsterdam.

                          HAZEL

           Thank you for letting me hijack

           your wish.

                          GUS

           Thank you for wearing that dress

           which is like whoa.

          Hazel shakes her head, trying not to smile but unable not to.

          The Waiter brings two more glasses of champagne and a plate:

                          WAITER

           Belgian white asparagus with a

           lavender infusion.

          Hazel takes a bite.

                          HAZEL

           Oh my god.

                          GUS

           Yeah?

          Gus takes a bite.

                          HAZEL

           I mean...

                          GUS

           That is just...

                          HAZEL

           There are no words.

          Meanwhile, down on the water a BOAT passes, filled with

          merry, drinking LOCALS. One of them raises a glass to them

          and says something in Dutch.

                          GUS

                          (SHOUTING BACK)

           We don't speak Dutch!

                          ANOTHER LOCAL

           She says, "the beautiful couple is

           beautiful!"

           66.

          Hazel and Gus smile. This night could not be going any better

          so far. CUT TO:

          LATER. Hazel and Gus enjoying their second courses.

                          GUS

           I want this dragon carrot risotto

           to become a person so I can take it

           to Vegas and marry it.

          Hazel leans back in her chair, in need of a breather.

                          HAZEL

           I like your suit.

                          GUS

           Thanks. First time wearing it.

                          HAZEL

           That isn't the suit you wear to

           funerals?

                          GUS

           Oh no. That one's not nearly this

           nice.

           (off her look)

           When I first found out I was sick -

           I mean, they told me I had like an

           85% chance to be cancer-free. Great

           odds, sure. But that meant a year

           of torture, the loss of my leg, and

           still a 15% chance it might fail.

                          (BEAT)

           So right before the surgery I asked

           my parents if I could buy a suit,

           like a really nice suit, just in

           case I didn't make it.

                          HAZEL

           It's your death suit.

                          GUS

           That's what it is.

                          HAZEL

           I have one of those. Bought it for

           my 15th birthday. Don't think I'd

           wear it on a date, though.

                          GUS

           Are we on a date?

                          HAZEL

           (cocks her head)

           Watch it.

          Gus winks. CUT TO:

          LATER. Dessert on the table. As they euphorically eat:

           67.

                          GUS

           God?

                          HAZEL

           Maybe.

                          GUS

           Angels?

                          HAZEL

           Undecided.

                          GUS

           Afterlife?

                          HAZEL

           No. Well...

                          (BEAT)

           Maybe I wouldn't go so far as to

           say no. I just... I'd like some

           evidence.

                          (GUS NODS)

           What do you think?

                          GUS

           Absolutely.

                          HAZEL

           Really?

                          GUS

           Oh for sure. I mean, not like a

           heaven where you ride unicorns,

           play harps, and live in a mansion

           made of clouds but, yeah, I believe

           in something.

          Hazel is surprised.

                          GUS

           Something becomes of us. It has to.

           Otherwise what's the point?

                          HAZEL

           Maybe there is no point.

                          GUS

           I refuse to accept that.

                          (BEAT)

           I won't accept it.

          Hazel thinks about it. She appreciates his conviction but is

          still not sure she agrees. The hand they've been dealt too

          unfair. Hazel looks out at the water as she says:

                          HAZEL

           I hope you're right.

                          GUS

           I'm in love with you.

           68.

          That gets her attention.

                          GUS

           You heard me.

                          HAZEL

                          AUGUSTUS --

                          GUS

           I'm in love with you. And I know

           that love is just a shout into the

           void, and that oblivion is

           inevitable, and that we're all

           doomed and that there will come a

           day when all our labor has been

           returned to dust, and I know the

           sun will swallow the only earth

           we'll ever have, and I am in love

           with you.

           (shrugs, matter-of-fact)

           Sorry.

          At which point, the Waiter reappears.

                          WAITER

           More stars?

          Hazel is still too speechless to respond, her eyes fixed on

          Gus. Eventually Gus answers for them.

                          GUS

           Just the check, please.

                          WAITER

           No, sir.

                          (BEAT)

           Your meal has been paid for by Mr.

           Van Houten.

          Gus raises his eyebrows at Hazel. This Van Houten guy is

          something else.

          EXT AMSTERDAM CANALS - LATER

          Hazel and Gus on a park bench, his arm around her, looking

          out over the water. Seeds blow from the elm trees and the

          reflections of the city ripple in the water below them.

          Hazel leans into his body, just a little. They stay like

          that, savoring the best night of both of their lives. CUT TO:

          EXT AMSTERDAM - HOTEL - ESTABLISHING

          A crisp Spring morning in Amsterdam. The buzz in the air

          outside is equalled by the buzz in:

           69.

          INT HOTEL ROOM - SAME

          Where Hazel excitedly paces through the room.

                          FRANNIE

           I really don't get that shirt.

          Hazel wears a screen print t-shirt of Magritte's "Ceci N'est

          Pas Une Pipe." (A painting of a pipe with words below that

          mean "This is not a pipe.")

                          HAZEL

           Van Houten will get it. Trust me.

           There are like fifty Magritte

           references in "Imperial

           Affliction."

                          FRANNIE

                          (READING)

           "This is not a pipe."

                          HAZEL

           Exactly.

                          FRANNIE

           But it is a pipe.

                          HAZEL

           No it's not. It's a drawing of a

           pipe. See?

                          (SHE DOESN'T)

           All representations of a thing are

           inherently abstract. A drawing of a

           thing is not the thing itself. Nor

           is a t-shirt of a drawing of a

           thing the thing itself.

          Frannie is still at a loss but she's impressed.

                          FRANNIE

           When did you get so grown up? I

           feel like it was yesterday I was

           telling 8-year old Hazel why the

           sky was blue. You thought I was a

           genius back then.

                          HAZEL

           Why is the sky blue?

                          FRANNIE

                          (BEAT)

           Because I say so.

          A knock on the door. Gus pokes his head in.

                          GUS

           Who's ready for some answers!

           70.

          EXT. VONDELSTRAAT ROW HOUSES - LATER

          Gus and Hazel stand outside Van Houten's white house.

                          HAZEL

           I'm so excited I can barely

           breathe.

                          GUS

           As opposed to other days...?

          She playfully hits him. He takes her arm, picks up the oxygen

          tank, and up they go towards his front door.

          As they approach, there's a noticeable NOISE coming from

          inside the house. It's the deep thump of a BASS BEAT. Loud.

          Like, obnoxiously loud.

          Hazel grabs the brass ornament and knocks. They wait. There's

          no response.

                          GUS

           Maybe he can't hear over the music?

          Gus tries again, this time with more force. Still nothing. He

          tries a third time. Finally, the music stops. They wait.

          Still excited.

          A moment later the door swings open.

          It's a MAN IN PAJAMAS (60s), with a huge potbelly, thinning

          hair, and a week-old beard. All he says is:

           MAN IN PAJAMAS

           What?!

          Gus and Hazel look to one another. Could it be?

                          GUS

           Mr. Van Houten?

          At which point, the Pajama Man slams the door in their faces.

          Hazel and Gus are too stunned to react. Through the closed

          door, they hear this:

           MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)

                          (SHOUTING)

           LEEE-DUH-VIGH!

           WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

           Are they here, Peter?

          So it is PETER VAN HOUTEN. Gus and Hazel can't believe it.

           MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)

           There are two --

                          (BEAT)

           Who the hell's "they?"

           71.

           WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

           They are Augustus and Hazel, the

           young fans with whom you've been

           corresponding.

          Gus and Hazel smile at hearing their names. Perhaps this will

          help things take a turn for the better.

           MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)

           The Americans?

           WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

           You invited them, remember?

           MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)

           You know why I left America,

           Lidewij? To never have to encounter

           Americans. Get rid of them.

          Hazel and Gus can't believe it. This is terrible!

           WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

           I will not do this Peter. Be nice.

          At which point, the door opens - opened by the Woman whose

          voice they'd been hearing - Van Houten's assistant LIDEWIJ

          (30s, Dutch, pretty in a bookish way). She virtually shoves

          Van Houten towards a stunned Gus and Hazel.

          And they are again face-to-face with Van Houten. One beat,

          two beats. No one knows what to say. Finally:

                          VAN HOUTEN

           Which of you is Augustus Waters?

          Gus raises his hand tentatively.

          Van Houten sizes them up. Without another word, he turns and

          walks inside - at least this time, leaving the door ajar.

                          LIDEWIJ

           Please. I am sorry. Come in.

          Hazel and Gus share one more awkward glance before Gus takes

          a step. Hazel follows. They walk:

          INT VAN HOUTEN'S HOME - SAME

          Lidewij leads Gus and Hazel into a living room so sterile

          it's creepy. The walls are empty and white, there's a single

          couch, a small ottoman, and a single lounge chair. That's it.

          Van Houten sits in the chair.

          Off to the side are two large black garbage bags, full and

          twist-tied.

                          HAZEL

           Trash?

           72.

                          LIDEWIJ

           Fan mail. 18 years worth. He never

           opens it.

          Van Houten kicks his feet up on the ottoman and crosses his

          slippers. He motions for them to sit on the couch.

                          VAN HOUTEN

           Yours are the first missives to

           which I've replied and look where

           that got me.

          Hazel and Gus take their seats.

                          VAN HOUTEN

           Scotch?

                          HAZEL

           Um, no thanks.

                          VAN HOUTEN

           Augustus Waters?

                          GUS

           It's 11am.

                          VAN HOUTEN

           Just me then, Lidewij. Scotch and

           soda.

                          LIDEWIJ

           Perhaps some breakfast first Peter?

                          VAN HOUTEN

           She thinks I have a drinking

           problem.

                          LIDEWIJ

           I also think the Earth is round.

          Nevertheless, Lidewij pours Peter half a glass and hands it

          to him. He takes a sip, then sits up straight.

                          VAN HOUTEN

           So you like my book.

                          HAZEL

           Yes. We - well, Augustus, he made

           meeting you his Wish so that we

           could come here and talk to you.

          Van Houten says nothing. Takes a long pull on his drink.

                          VAN HOUTEN

           Did you dress like her on purpose?

                          HAZEL

           (looks at her shirt)

           Kinda.

           73.

          Van Houten says nothing to that.

                          VAN HOUTEN

           I do not have a drinking problem. I

           have a Churchillian relationship

           with alcohol: I can crack jokes and

           govern England and do anything I

           want to do. Except not drink.

          He glances over at Lidewij, who dutifully refills his glass.

                          GUS

           Incidentally, thank you for dinner

           last night.

                          VAN HOUTEN

                          (TO LIDEWIJ)

           We bought them dinner last night?

                          LIDEWIJ

           It was our pleasure.

                          VAN HOUTEN

                          (SIGHS)

           You've come a long way so... what

           is it I can do for you?

                          HAZEL

           We have some questions --

                          VAN HOUTEN

           Uh-huh...

                          HAZEL

           About what happens, you know...

           after... the end of your book.

           Specifically to those who Anna

           leaves behind. Like her Mom, the

           Dutch Tulip Man, Sisy --

                          VAN HOUTEN

                          (INTERRUPTING)

           How familiar are you with Swedish

           hip-hop?

          Hazel looks at Gus. Is he kidding?

                          HAZEL

           I would say... limited?

                          VAN HOUTEN

           But presumably you know Afasi Och

           Filthy's seminal album "Flacken."

                          GUS

           Um...

                          VAN HOUTEN

           Lidewij! Play `Bomfalleralla'

           immediately.

           74.

          Lidewij sighs but she does as she's told. A few seconds

          later, some loud Swedish rap song blasts from the speakers.

          Hazel and Gus sit through this, totally baffled.

                          HAZEL

           (yelling over the music)

           I'm sorry, sir. We don't speak

           Swedish.

                          VAN HOUTEN

                          (YELLING)

           Who the hell speaks Swedish? The

           important thing is not what

           nonsense the voices are saying, but

           what the voices are feeling.

          The song continues another awkward ten seconds or so before

          Gus has enough. He gets up and turns off the music.

                          GUS

           Are you messing with us?

                          VAN HOUTEN

           Pardon?

                          GUS

           Is this some kind of performance?

                          VAN HOUTEN

           Rudolf Otto said that if you had

           not encountered the numinous then

           his work was not for you. And I say

           to you, my friends, if you cannot

           hear Afasi Och Filthy's bravadic

           response to fearfulness, then my

           work is not for you.

          Hazel is really getting worried at this point. They came all

          this way for this?

                          HAZEL

           So anyway... when the book ends,

           Anna's mom --

                          VAN HOUTEN

           (raising a hand to silence

                          HER)

           Let us imagine that you are racing

           a tortoise.

          Hazel and Gus fidget in their seats. Lidewij frowns, clearly

          feeling bad for them. Van Houten continues.

                          VAN HOUTEN

           The tortoise has a ten yard head

           start. In the time it takes you to

           run ten yards, the tortoise has

           moved maybe one yard. And so on,

           forever.

                          (MORE)

           75.

           VAN HOUTEN (CONT'D)

           You are faster than the tortoise

           but you can never catch him, you

           see, you can only decrease his

           lead. Now certainly you can run

           past the tortoise as long as you

           don't contemplate the mechanics

           involved but the question of how

           turns out to be so complicated that

           no one really solved it until

           Cantor's proof that some infinities

           are bigger than other infinities.

          Hazel and Gus have no idea how to respond.

                          VAN HOUTEN

           I assume that answers your

           questions.

                          GUS

                          (TO HAZEL)

           I don't know what's going on.

                          VAN HOUTEN

           And yet you seemed so intelligent

           in print, Mr. Waters.

           (under his breath)

           Must be all that cancer in your

           brain.

                          LIDEWIJ

           Peter!

          Gus could throw a punch right now. Hazel tries to calm the

          situation.

                          HAZEL

           Can we please, maybe, talk about

           Anna for a sec? I mean, I

           understand that the story ends mid-

           sentence because she dies or she

           becomes too sick to continue --

                          VAN HOUTEN

           I'm not interested in talking about

           that book.

                          HAZEL

           - but that doesn't mean her family

           and everyone she loves doesn't have

           a future, right?

                          VAN HOUTEN

           I said I'm not interested --

                          HAZEL

                          (GETTING UPSET)

           But you promised!

                          (CALMS HERSELF)

                          (MORE)

           76.

                          HAZEL (CONT'D)

           Mr. Van Houten, you said you would

           tell us what happens and that's why

           we're here. We... I need you tell

           me. Surely you've thought about it.

           I mean, as characters --

                          VAN HOUTEN

           Nothing happens to them! They're

           fictions. They cease to exist the

           moment the novel is over.

          This is not what Hazel came all this way to hear. She won't

          accept it.

                          HAZEL

           They can't!

           (again, has to calm

                          HERSELF)

           I mean, I understand. In a literary

           sense. But it's impossible NOT to

           imagine some future --

                          VAN HOUTEN

           I can't do this. Lidewij, get rid

           of them, please.

           (Lidewij doesn't move, he

           turns back to Hazel)

           I won't indulge your childish

           whims. I refuse to pity you in the

           manner in which you're accustomed.

                          HAZEL

           I don't want your pity --

                          VAN HOUTEN

           Of course you do. Like all sick

           kids, your existence depends on it.

                          LIDEWIJ

           Peter!

                          VAN HOUTEN

           (on a roll)

           You are fated to live out your days

           as the child you were when

           diagnosed, the child who believes

           there is life after a novel ends.

           And we, as adults, we pity this, so

           we pay for your treatments, for

           your oxygen machines. We give you

           food and water though you are

           unlikely to live long enough --

                          LIDEWIJ

           PETER!

                          VAN HOUTEN

           You are a side effect of an

           evolutionary process that cares

           little for individual lives.

                          (MORE)

           77.

           VAN HOUTEN (CONT'D)

           You are a failed experiment in

           mutation.

                          LIDEWIJ

           I RESIGN!

          Lidewij has tears in her eyes. Gus has balled his fists. But

          not Hazel. Van Houten's words have not phased her one bit.

          She rises from the couch.

                          HAZEL

           Hey listen douchepants. You're not

           gonna tell me anything I don't

           already know about illness. I need

           one thing and one thing only from

           you before I walk out of your life

           and that's for you to tell me what

           happens to your goddman characters!

                          VAN HOUTEN

                          (BEAT)

           I cannot tell you.

                          HAZEL

           Bullshit!

                          VAN HOUTEN

           I cannot --

          Van Houten goes to take a drink but...

                          HAZEL

           Make something up.

          ... Hazel smacks it right the fuck out of his hands,

          surprising everyone.

          After a beat:

                          VAN HOUTEN

           Lidewij. I'll have a martini

           please.

                          LIDEWIJ

           I have resigned.

                          VAN HOUTEN

           Oh don't be ridiculous.

          No one moves. Van Houten realizes he's alone in this.

                          VAN HOUTEN

           I'd like you to leave now.

                          HAZEL

           You're really not gonna tell us?

                          VAN HOUTEN

           I would like you... to leave.

           78.

          Hazel is furious. Gus stands next to her, touches her arm is

          if to say "come on, enough of this guy." CUT TO:

          EXT VAN HOUTEN'S HOUSE - SAME

          Gus and Hazel come out of the house, practically shaking. As

          they get to the street, Van Houten has one more thing to say.

                          VAN HOUTEN

           Have you ever stopped to ask why

           you care so much about your silly

           questions?

          A beat.

                          HAZEL

           Go fuck yourself.

          Van Houten doesn't have a response to that. He just shuts the

          door. And when he does, that's when Hazel gets emotional.

                          GUS

           Hey. It's ok. It's ok...

           (beat, an idea)

           I'll write you a sequel.

           (she cries harder)

           I will. Better than any shit that

           drunk could write. With blood and

           guts and sacrifice. You'll love it.

          Hazel nods, then wipes away tears. She fakes a smile and Gus

          gives her a hug. Afterwards:

                          HAZEL

           I spent your Wish on that asshole.

                          GUS

           You did not spend it on him. You

           spent it on us.

          They embrace once more.

                          HAZEL

           I wanted...

                          GUS

           I know... I know. Apparently the

           world is not a wish-granting

           factory.

          This gets a real smile from Hazel. That's when Lidewij comes

          outside. Clearly she's been crying too.

                          LIDEWIJ

           I'm so sorry. Circumstance has made

           him cruel. I thought meeting you

           would help him, if he would see

           that his work has shaped real

           lives, but... I'm very sorry.

           79.

          Hazel says nothing. Gus holds her in a very protective way.

                          LIDEWIJ

           Perhaps we can do some sightseeing.

           Have you seen the Anne Frank House?

                          GUS

           I'm not going anywhere with that

           monster.

                          LIDEWIJ

           He is not invited.

          EXT ANNE FRANK HOUSE - LATER

          Lidewij walks back from the ticket kiosk with more bad news.

                          LIDEWIJ

           I'm afraid there's no elevator.

                          HAZEL

           Oh, um, that's alright.

                          LIDEWIJ

           No, there are many stairs. Steep

           stairs.

                          HAZEL

           I can do it.

                          GUS

                          HAZEL --

                          HAZEL

           I can do it!

          Hazel is not going to stand for any more disappointments

          today. They are going inside. CUT TO:

          INT ANNE FRANK HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

          A VIDEO plays on a MONITOR showing the Nazi invasion of

          Holland. Hazel and Gus stand with Lidewij in a pack of

          BACKPACKERS and TRAVELERS about to take the tour. Many of

          them begin to walk up the first flight of stairs.

                          LIDEWIJ

           Shall we?

          Hazel nods. Both Hazel and Gus walk slowly up the stairs. So

          far so good. They find themselves in an office space.

                          LIDEWIJ

           This is the bookcase that hid the

           Frank family and four others.

          The BOOKCASE is half open. Behind it is an even steeper set

          of stairs, only wide enough for one person at a time.

           80.

          Some of the Travelers begin to walk up the stairs. Gus looks

          at Hazel - are you sure we should continue? She begins the

          climb, determined. Lidewij trails behind, carrying her oxygen

          tank.

          Hazel moves very slowly. We are aware of her labored

          breathing the entire time.

          ANGLE ON OTHER TOURISTS, watching and quietly commenting.

          Just like at the airport, except now in foreign languages.

          Hazel arrives on the NEXT FLOOR - an empty room. She's

          definitely starting to struggle. She leans against the wall

          to catch her breath. Gus comes to her side, wipes her brow.

                          GUS

           You're a champion.

          Hazel smiles. When she's feeling up to it they walk into the

          next room, also empty. And another staircase, even more

          narrow and steep - practically a ladder. When Gus sees this

          he looks at Hazel:

                          GUS

           That's enough --

                          HAZEL

                          (RESOLUTE)

           I'm ok.

          Hazel very slowly begins the climb. Again we're aware of her

          every breath. It's dark. And it's becoming very difficult.

          Near the top Hazel stumbles but is finally able to pull

          herself through.

          Once there, she falls to the floor, slumping against the

          wall, trying to catch her breath. Gus crouches next to her.

                          GUS

           We're at the top. That's it.

          Hazel becomes aware that TOURISTS look at her with concern.

          She smiles, stands up, nothing to see here.

          And now they're in the final room - a long, narrow hallway.

          This is where Anne Frank and 7 other people lived in hiding

          for as long as they could. There's a TIME LINE detailing

          their story.

                          LIDEWIJ

           The only member of the whole family

           to survive was Otto, Anne's father.

          Gus takes Hazel's hand.

                          LIDEWIJ

           I don't know how you go on, without

           your family.

           81.

          Lidewij stays behind to study part of the exhibit. Gus leads

          Hazel into the room at the end of the hallway where a VIDEO

          details the last days of Anne Frank's life. Over it, we hear

          a YOUNG GIRL's VOICE reading from the diary.

          The Travelers stand to watch and listen. Gus and Hazel do the

          same. The room is dark.

           GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)

           "At such moment's, I don't think

           about the misery..."

          Gus and Hazel stand very closely together. The video is the

          cherry on top of a very emotional day. Hazel watches it.

           GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)

           "...but about the beauty that still

           remains."

          Gus, meanwhile, is just watching Hazel, the same way she

          watched him on the airplane. After a beat, she catches him.

          Their eyes meet. The emotions build...

           GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)

           "Try to recapture the happiness

           within yourself. Think of all the

           beauty in everything around you...

           and be happy."

          And Hazel KISSES Gus. A most passionate, intense, you-and-me-

          against-the-world kind of kiss, better than any they've

          experienced or could even imagine. It seems to last for a

          small eternity.

          Eventually, they break away and open their eyes. They quickly

          notice all the Travelers staring at them. For a brief second,

          they wonder if that was a very inappropriate thing to do...

          When suddenly everyone starts clapping for them, moved by the

          whole thing. One EUROPEAN even shouts "bravo!" Hazel blushes,

          Gus smiles, bows, he grabs her hand. CUT TO:

          INT GUS'S HOTEL ROOM - LATER

          They fall onto Gus's bed, kissing. Hazel is very in the

          moment and now it's Gus who seems nervous. As they kiss:

                          GUS

           It's above my knee.

          She ignores him, more kissing. She takes off his shirt.

                          GUS

           It tapers a little and then it's

           just skin --

                          HAZEL

           What?

           82.

          Hazel pulls away from him.

                          GUS

           My leg.

                          (BEAT)

           Just so you're prepared --

                          HAZEL

           Oh get over yourself.

          Hazel kisses him again. Now he tries to pull her shirt off

          but it gets tangled in with her oxygen tube. He can't figure

          it out. Eventually the whole thing is hilarious to them. They

          shake their heads - laughing - certainly not your typical

          Hollywood movie moment. And yet, for them:

                          HAZEL

           I love you, Augustus Waters.

                          GUS

           I love you too, Hazel Grace.

          They resume kissing. And we CUT TO:

          INT HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

          Gus wakes up in the bed. He looks around for Hazel but she

          isn't there. On the bed is a piece of paper. A note.

          It reads: "Dearest Augustus..."

          Beneath that is a BIG CIRCLE, labeled "Virgins." And in that

          circle is a SMALLER SECOND CIRCLE labeled "17 year old dudes

          with one leg." We'll notice part of that circle is now

          outside the bigger circle. Gus flashes that signature smile.

          EXT CAFE - DAY

          Hazel and Gus sit with Frannie drinking coffee in the sun at

          an outdoor cafe. They're re-enacting yesterday's events.

                          HAZEL

           "Get up you fat bastard."

                          GUS

           "I can't stand up, I'm too drunk."

                          HAZEL

           I said "get up."

                          GUS

           "Standing is for fools!"

                          HAZEL

           God, what an asshole.

          They both giggle at the whole thing.

           83.

                          HAZEL

           It was awful, Mom. You can't

           imagine.

                          FRANNIE

           And then what happened?

                          HAZEL

           Then we went to the Anne Frank

           museum.

                          FRANNIE

           And after that?

          A quick glance between Hazel and Gus.

                          HAZEL

           We just... walked around.

          Hazel and Gus smile, thoroughly in love but trying to keep it

          in check in front of her Mother.

                          FRANNIE

           Sounds lovely.

          A few beats later.

                          FRANNIE

           Listen... I'm gonna stretch my legs

           a little. Give the two of you some

           time to talk.

                          HAZEL

                          (THAT'S WEIRD)

           Um... ok...

          As she stands up to leave, Hazel thinks she catches Gus and

          Frannie making eye contact for a brief second. Once Frannie

          has left them:

                          HAZEL

           That was weird.

          Gus doesn't respond except to say:

                          GUS

           Shall we?

          EXT AMSTERDAM STREET - LATER

          They start to walk. Gus takes a cigarette out of his pack,

          sticks it between his lips. Hazel notices he's struggling

          with something.

                          HAZEL

           Augustus?

           84.

                          GUS

           There's something I have to tell

           you...

          They walk in silence a few beats.

                          GUS

           Just before you went into the

           hospital... There was this... I

           felt this... ache in my hip.

          Hazel grabs onto his arm, a lump already forming.

                          HAZEL

           Oh no...

          Gus takes the cigarette out of his mouth, clenches his teeth

          tightly, trying not to cry.

                          GUS

           I had a PET scan.

          Gus sits down on a BENCH. Looks up at her. Tries to smile.

          Before he even says it, she knows.

                          GUS

           It lit up like a Christmas tree,

           Hazel...

                          HAZEL

           Oh god.

                          GUS

           The lining of my chest, my liver...

           everywhere.

                          HAZEL

           Oh my god no!

          Hazel loses it in that moment, falling on top of him, hugging

          him for dear life, her head in his lap.

                          HAZEL

           I'm so sorry, Augustus. I'm so so

                          SORRY --

                          GUS

           I'm sorry too --

                          HAZEL

           It's so unfair --

                          GUS

           I should have told you --

                          HAZEL

           It's so fucking unfair!

          A beat. Gus still trying not to cry.

           85.

                          GUS

           Apparently the world is... not a

           wish-granting factory.

          And at that point, Gus lets it go, lets himself cry and be

          sad and feel awful.

          But just for a second. Then he shakes it off, pulls Hazel's

          face up to his, tries again to smile through the tears.

                          GUS

           Don't you worry about me, Hazel

           Grace. I'll find a way to hang

           around and annoy you for a long

           time.

          She hugs him, perhaps a little too tightly. He winces.

                          HAZEL

           Does it hurt?

                          GUS

           It's ok.

                          (BEAT)

           I'm ok.

                          HAZEL

           Ok.

                          GUS

           Ok.

          But of course it's not ok. Not by a mile.

          Hazel takes a moment to look at him, touches his cheek.

                          GUS

           What?

                          HAZEL

           I'm just... I'm very fond of you.

          He grabs her hand and holds it.

                          GUS

           I don't suppose you can forget

           about it, treat me like I'm not

           dying.

                          HAZEL

           I don't think you're dying,

           Augustus. You've just got a touch

           of cancer.

          Gus nods. Squeezes her hand.

                          GUS

           Would it be absolutely ludicrous to

           make out right now?

           86.

          Hazel doesn't answer. She just kisses him, hard. And on the

          two of them, so in love, we CUT TO:

          INT AIRPLANE - LATER

          Hazel lays on Gus's shoulder as he stares out the window,

          leaving Amsterdam behind.

          INT INDIANAPOLIS AIRPORT - BAGGAGE CLAIM - DAY

          As they ride down the escalator, Hazel sees Michael standing

          amongst the livery drivers. He holds a sign that says -

          instead of someone's last name - "My Beautiful Family (and

          Gus)."

          Upon seeing them, he immediately starts to cry of course. He

          kisses his wife, gives Hazel a big hug. Gus goes to shake his

          hand but Michael hugs him as well. CUT TO:

          INT HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM - THAT NIGHT

          Hazel sits with her father on the couch.

                          HAZEL

           Gus had a recurrence.

                          MICHAEL

                          (NODS)

           Mrs. Waters told us the night

           before you left.

                          (BEAT)

           I'm sorry Hazel.

          They sit for a beat. Tears form in Michael's eyes.

                          HAZEL

           You're not gonna say it?

                          MICHAEL

           What's that?

                          HAZEL

           The usual. "Everything happens for

           a reason..."

          Michael shakes his head.

                          MICHAEL

           I don't know, Haze.

                          (BEAT)

           I always thought being an adult

           meant knowing what you believe...

                          (BEAT)

           ... that has not been my

           experience.

          Hazel understands exactly. CUT TO:

          INT GUS'S BASEMENT BEDROOM - DAY

          Gus lays in bed, eyes open, a PICC line now being fed through

          a port in his chest. Chemotherapy at work.

          Hazel and Isaac are keeping him company.

                          HAZEL

           How are your eyes?

                          ISAAC

           Great. Wonderful. I mean, they're

           not in my head is the only problem.

                          GUS

           I hate to one-up you but... seems

           my entire body is made out of

           cancer now, so...

          Isaac nods. Tries not to get emotional but it's happening. He

          goes to touch Gus's arm and accidentally touches his thigh.

                          GUS

           Whoa, I'm taken.

          Isaac laughs.

                          ISAAC

           (to Hazel, re: Gus)

           Did you write his eulogy yet?

          Hazel is confused.

                          GUS

           Dude.

                          ISAAC

           What?

                          GUS

                          (STILL CONFUSED)

           Augustus?

          Gus looks at her, grows a little serious.

           88.

                          GUS

           I need speakers at my funeral. I

           thought maybe you and Isaac... but

           especially you --

                          ISAAC

           Hey!

                          GUS

           Would you be kind enough to whip

           something up?

                          HAZEL

           (touches his hand)

           It would be an honor.

          They hold holds.

                          ISAAC

           You guys are adorable.

          Hazel play slaps Isaac on the arm.

                          HAZEL

           How's your love life? Anything from

           Monica?

                          ISAAC

           Not a word.

                          HAZEL

           She hasn't even like, texted to ask

           how you're doing?

          He shakes his head. Gus gets an angry look on his face.

                          HAZEL

           That is so messed up!

                          ISAAC

           I've stopped thinking about it.

           Moving on. There's a new girl in

           Support Group with these humongous -

          Isaac gestures to his chest. Hazel is confused.

                          HAZEL

           How do you even know that?

                          ISAAC

           I'm blind but I'm not that blind.

                          GUS

           Hazel Grace!

          They turn to him.

                          GUS

           Do you happen to have four dollars?

           89.

          No one knows what that means. CUT TO:

          INT HAZEL'S CAR - LATER

          Gus is in the passenger's seat. Isaac sits in the back. Hazel

          returns to the car. With a CARTON OF EGGS.

                          HAZEL

           Ok now what?

          Gus smiles. CUT TO:

          EXT SUBURBAN STREET - MOMENTS LATER

          Hazel, Gus, and Isaac lean against Hazel's car staring

          something down.

                          ISAAC

           Is it there?

                          GUS

           Oh it's there.

          REVEAL they're looking at Monica's green Firebird.

                          ISAAC

           She's in the house?

                          GUS

           Who cares where she is? This is not

           about her. This is about you.

           (sticks out his hand)

           Hazel...

          Hazel nods, opens the egg carton, hands Gus an egg. Gus puts

          it in Isaac's hands. Positions Isaac - who, of course, can't

          see a thing - towards the Firebird.

          Isaac winds up and tosses the EGG.

          It misses the car by a mile. After a beat:

                          ISAAC

           I didn't hear anything.

                          GUS

           A little to the left.

                          ISAAC

           My throw was to the left or I

           should aim to the left?

                          GUS

           Aim left.

          Isaac turns his shoulders.

           90.

                          GUS

           Lefter.

          Isaac turns some more.

                          GUS

           Yes! Excellent! And throw hard.

          Gus hands him a SECOND EGG. Isaac winds up and hurls it -

          missing the car again but hitting the HOUSE.

                          GUS

           Bullseye!

                          ISAAC

           Really?

                          GUS

           No you missed it by like 20 feet.

           (hands him a THIRD)

           Try one more time.

          Isaac hurls it, this time smashing the car's taillight.

          Isaac's face lights up.

                          HAZEL

           Woo hoo!

          Isaac grabs for ANOTHER EGG. Throws it. Then ANOTHER. He's a

          throwing machine. Most of them miss but at least he's

          enjoying himself. Finally there's a DIRECT HIT on the car

          door, triggering the alarm. Isaac pauses.

                          GUS

           Keep throwing, keep throwing!

          Isaac does. Gus smiles, putting an unlit cigarette in his

          mouth. Hazel watches him, enjoying this moment.

          Eventually, MONICA'S MOM opens the front door and comes out.

                          MONICA'S MOM

           What in God's name --

          Seeing Hazel, Gus, and Isaac, she stops in her tracks.

                          GUS

           Are you Monica's mom?

                          MONICA'S MOM

                          (CONFUSED)

           I am.

                          GUS

           Hello ma'am. Your daughter has done

           an injustice and we've come here

           seeking revenge. We may not look

           like much. Between the three of us,

           we have five legs, four eyes, and

           two and a half working lungs.

                          (MORE)

           91.

                          GUS (CONT'D)

           But we also have two dozen eggs. So

           If I was you, I would go back

           inside.

          Monica's Mom is very confused. A beat. Without another word,

          she turns and goes back inside. The three of them celebrate.

          As Isaac picks up where he left off, Hazel gently kisses Gus

          on the cheek. And over we hear:

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           A few days later, Gus landed in the

           hospital with chest pains.

          INT HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - DAY

          Hazel bounds in to find Mrs. Waters in the waiting room. She

          stands to hug Hazel. They both sit down.

                          HAZEL

           How's he doing?

           MRS. WATERS

           He's had a tough night, Hazel. His

           blood pressure's low. His heart --

          Mrs. Waters starts to cry.

                          HAZEL

           What about the chemo?

           MRS. WATERS

           (shakes her head)

           They're gonna stop the chemo.

          They both know what that means. Mrs. Waters gathers herself.

                          HAZEL

           Can I see him?

           MRS. WATERS

                          (BEAT)

           We have to be a family now.

          Hazel nods. She understands.

           MRS. WATERS

           We'll tell him you were here.

                          HAZEL

           If you don't mind, I'll just hang

           for a while.

          Mrs. Waters nods, hugs her again, walks out through the heavy

          doors towards Gus's room. Hazel sits in the chair. Same chair

          Gus sat in while waiting for her. They've switched places.

           92.

          EXT INDIANAPOLIS MUSEUM OF ART - DAY

          Hazel pushes Gus, now confined to a WHEELCHAIR, to their spot

          on the hill overlooking "Funky Bones." A second picnic, this

          time with champagne. Hazel pours some for them both into

          little Winnie the Pooh cups. She's trying to be upbeat - but

          it's difficult. Gus watches the kids play on the bones.

                          HAZEL

           What are you thinking about?

                          GUS

           Oblivion.

                          HAZEL

           Augustus...

                          GUS

           I know it's kid's stuff but... I

           always thought I'd have a grand

           story to tell, you know? Something

           that would run in all the papers. I

           always thought I was special.

                          HAZEL

           You are.

                          GUS

           Yeah but... you know what I mean.

          Hazel, annoyed finishes her cup, tosses it to the side. Gus

          can tell he's said something wrong.

                          GUS

           What?

                          HAZEL

           I do know what you mean, I just...

           I don't agree.

          Hazel stands up, anger building.

                          HAZEL

           This obsession with being

                          REMEMBERED --

                          GUS

           Don't get mad --

                          HAZEL

           But I am mad!

                          (BEAT)

           I think you're special, is that not

           enough?

                          GUS

                          HAZEL --

           93.

                          HAZEL

           You think the only way to live a

           meaningful life is for everyone to

           love you, for everyone to remember

           you. Well guess what, Gus, this is

           your life. This is all you get. You

           get me, and your family, and this

           world. And if that's not enough,

           well I'm sorry, but it's not

           nothing. Cause I'll remember you,

           I'll love you --

                          GUS

           You're right --

                          HAZEL

           And I just wish... I just wish

           you'd be happy with that.

                          GUS

           You're right. I'm sorry.

           (pulling her back down)

           I'm sorry.

          Gus hands Hazel another Winnie the Pooh cup. Raises his to

          hers in a toast.

                          GUS

           It's a good life, Hazel Grace.

          She softens. They toast.

                          HAZEL

           It's not over yet, you know.

          Gus nods. Of course it isn't. And yet they both know there

          isn't much time. CUT TO:

          INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT

          Hazel is asleep. Suddenly, her phone buzzes. She looks at it -

          "Gus" - then she looks at the clock - 2:35am. A pit grows in

          her stomach. A quick panicked beat before she answers:

                          HAZEL

           Hello?

           GUS (O.S.)

                          (WEAKLY)

                          HAZEL

                          (RELIEVED)

           Oh, thank God. Hi. Hi, I love you!

           GUS (O.S.)

           I'm at the gas station --

           94.

                          HAZEL

           What?

           GUS (O.S.)

           Something's wrong. You gotta...

           please come help me.

          INT/ EXT HAZEL'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

          Hazel drives like a maniac down the street, eventually

          finding herself at the Speedway gas station.

          Gus's car is alone in the parking lot and she pulls up next

          to it. She gets out of her car, opens his driver's side door,

          and finds him sitting there, his shirt stained with vomit and

          blood. She gags from the smell.

                          GUS

                          (MUMBLING)

           Hi.

          Hazel looks down at his hands which are pressed tightly to

          his belly. She sees something is leaking from the TUBE

          sticking out of it.

                          HAZEL

                          (PANICKED)

           Oh, God, Augustus, I'm calling 911.

                          GUS

           No! Please! Hazel, listen to me. Do

           not call 911 or my parents -- I'll

           never forgive you -- Don't, please.

          Gus starts to cry.

                          GUS

           Please just look at it.

          Hazel lifts up his shirt. His ABDOMEN is bright red.

                          HAZEL

           I think it's infected...

          Hazel feels his forehead, he's burning up.

                          HAZEL

           Gus, what the -- why are you here?

           Why aren't you home?

          Gus throws up. He doesn't even have the energy to turn his

          mouth away from his lap.

                          HAZEL

           Oh, sweetie...

                          GUS

           I wanted to buy some cigarettes. I

           lost my pack. Or they took it.

                          (MORE)

           95.

                          GUS (CONT'D)

           I don't know. They said they'd get

           me another one but I wanted... to

           do it myself. Do one little thing

           myself.

          Hazel doesn't know what to do.

                          HAZEL

           I can't fix this. I have to call

           someone. I'm sorry.

                          GUS

           No, Hazel, please!

          But she must. She gets out her cell phone and dials. At which

          point, Gus really loses it, weeping like the poisoned, dying

          teenage boy that he is. As Hazel dials, we hear:

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           I wish I could say Augustus Waters

           kept his sense of humor till the

           end, did not for a moment waiver in

           his courage and his spirit soared

           like an eagle to the sky...

                          GUS

           (to himself, shaking)

           I hate myself I hate myself I hate

           this I hate this...

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           ...but that is not what happened.

          LATER. An EMT loads Gus into the back of an AMBULANCE. Hazel

          is allowed to ride with him in the back. As the car starts

          moving, Gus grabs her hand.

                          GUS

           Read me something.

                          HAZEL

           Read you something?

                          GUS

           Do you know any poems?

                          HAZEL

           I know one.

                          GUS

           Read it to me.

                          HAZEL

           "The Red Wheelbarrow" by William

           Carlos Williams.

           (beat, tries to remember)

           "So much depends / upon / a red

           wheel / barrow / glazed with rain /

           water / beside the white /

           chickens."

                          (BEAT)

           Is that it?

          That is it. But there's another ten minutes of driving to do.

          Hazel thinks fast.

                          HAZEL

           No of course not. Um... what

           else...

                          (THINKS)

           so much depends/ upon a blue sky/

           cut open by the branches/ of the

           trees./ So much depends/ on the

           transparent G-tube/ erupting from

           the belly/ of the blue-lipped boy.

          Gus smiles, weakly, barely conscious. Hazel cradles his head

          in her arms. And continues...

                          HAZEL

           So much depends upon this observer/

           of the universe...

          As Gus is drifting off to sleep, WE HEAR:

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           One of the less bull-shitty

           conventions of the cancer genre is

           the convention known as the "Last

           Good Day..."

          EXT GUS'S HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY

          Gus comes home from the hospital. He does not look good - but

          he lives. Hazel is there to help get him inside.

          INT GUS'S HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY

          Gus no longer sleeps in his basement. Nor does he sleep in

          his own bed. He sleeps in a HOSPITAL BED set up in a guest

          room. Hazel is with him. They're watching sports on TV.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           This is where the victim of cancer

           finds himself unexpectedly with

           some hours...

          EXT GUS'S BACKYARD PORCH - ANOTHER DAY

          Hazel and Gus getting some fresh air. She sits there reading

          a book. Gus just sits there. His eyes staring off into

          nothing. Hazel waves to him. Gus looks over, as if waking

          from a dream. She manages a smile. He manages one back.

           97.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           ... when it seems like the

           inexorable decline has suddenly

           plateaued, when the pain is for a

           minute bearable.

          INT HAZEL'S DINING ROOM - ANOTHER DAY

          Hazel sits at dinner with her parents. She is barely touching

          her food.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           The problem, of course, is that

           there's no way of knowing that your

           last good day is your "Last Good

           Day." At the time, it's just

           another decent day.

          The phone buzzes and Hazel answers it.

                          HAZEL

           Hi, Augustus.

           GUS (O.S.)

           Good evening, Hazel Grace.

          His voice is strong today, and Hazel is happy to hear it.

           GUS (O.S.)

           Quick question for you. Did you

           ever write that eulogy I asked you

           to prepare?

                          HAZEL

           I may have...

                          GUS

           Excellent. Do you think you could

           find yourself at the Literal Heart

           of Jesus in 20 minutes.

                          HAZEL

           Um... sure. Is everything --

           GUS (O.S.)

           I love you Hazel.

          The call ends. Hazel, confused, stands to go.

                          HAZEL

           I gotta go.

                          FRANNIE

           Finish eating first.

                          HAZEL

           I can't, I have to meet Gus.

           98.

                          FRANNIE

           You haven't eaten a thing.

                          HAZEL

           I'm not hungry.

                          FRANNIE

           You can't not eat, Hazel.

                          HAZEL

           I am aggressively unhungry, ok?

                          MICHAEL

                          HAZEL --

                          HAZEL

           I have to go.

                          FRANNIE

           Sit down.

                          HAZEL

           No!

                          MICHAEL

           Hazel, listen to your mother.

          Hazel tries to push past her but Frannie grabs her shoulders.

                          FRANNIE

           You have to eat, Hazel. You're not

           gonna starve yourself to death just

           because Gus is sick. You have to

           stay healthy --

                          HAZEL

           I can't! I can't stay healthy

           because I'm not healthy, Mom. I am

           dying. I am going to die and leave

           you here alone and you won't have

           me to hover around and you won't be

           a mother anymore, and I'm sorry,

           but I can't do anything about it,

           ok?! Just leave me alone!

          Upon seeing her mother's face change, Hazel immediately

          regrets this.

                          FRANNIE

           You heard me?

          Frannie has tears in her eyes. Hazel looks away, feeling

          terrible.

                          FRANNIE

           You heard me say that to your

           father?

          Frannie sits down on the couch with her daughter.

           99.

                          FRANNIE

           Oh god, sweetie. I'm sorry. I was

           wrong, ok? It wasn't true. It's not

           something I believe.

          Michael sits across from them.

                          FRANNIE

           As long as either of us is alive, I

           will be your mother. Even if you

           die, I --

                          HAZEL

           When.

                          FRANNIE

           Even when you die, I will still be

           your mother. I will always be your

           Mother.

          By now Michael is crying too. They all are.

                          HAZEL

           I worry that you won't have a life.

           That you'll sit around all day with

           no me to look after and stare at

           the walls and be miserable or off

           yourselves or something.

                          FRANNIE

           We're not gonna off ourselves. It's

           gonna hurt like hell to lose you

                          BUT --

                          MICHAEL

           Hazel. You of all people know it's

           possible to live with pain.

          She takes that in. It rings true to her. Hazel nods.

                          FRANNIE

           I don't just sit around, you know.

          Hazel is confused. Frannie looks at Michael like, "should I

          say something?" She goes for it.

                          FRANNIE

           I'm taking some classes. Online. To

           get my master's in social work.

                          HAZEL

           You are?

          Hazel is stunned.

                          HAZEL

           So when you're waiting for me

           outside Support Group or whatever,

           you're always --

           100.

                          FRANNIE

           Working or reading. If I get my

           MSW, I can council families in

           crisis or lead groups dealing with

                          ILLNESS --

                          HAZEL

           Why didn't you tell me?

          Frannie and Michael don't quite know what to say.

                          MICHAEL

           We didn't want you to feel

                          ABANDONED --

                          HAZEL

           Are you kidding? Mom, this is

           awesome! This is fantastic! Oh my

           god!

          Hazel grabs her Mom for a hug.

                          HAZEL

           I'm so excited! You're gonna be so

           great, Mom!

                          FRANNIE

           Thank you. That means everything to

           me.

          Mom and Daughter hug. And when it's over:

                          FRANNIE

           I'd still really like you to eat.

                          HAZEL

           I know Mom. And I will. I promise.

           But right now... I really gotta go.

          INT CHURCH - LATER

          Hazel enters the Literal Heart of Jesus room which is now

          empty except for Isaac, up on a dais, and Gus, in his

          wheelchair. Gus is thinner than we've ever seen him, thinner

          than any young man should be. But for now, he's happy.

                          GUS

           Hazel Grace, you look ravishing.

                          HAZEL

           I know, right?

                          (BEAT)

           So, um, what's going on guys?

                          ISAAC

           You're late.

                          HAZEL

           Late for what exactly?

           101.

          Gus gestures for her to sit next to him and she does.

                          GUS

           I wanted to attend my funeral. By

           the way, will you speak at my

           funeral?

          Hazel looks at him like "of course, silly" and then kisses

          him on the mouth.

                          GUS

           Sweet. I'm hopeful I'll get to

           attend as a ghost, but just to make

           sure, I thought I'd - well, not to

           put you on the spot, but I thought

           I'd arrange a pre-funeral.

                          HAZEL

           Why now?

                          GUS

           No time like the present.

                          HAZEL

           (looks around the room)

           How did you even get in here?

                          GUS

           Would you believe they leave the

           door open at night?

                          HAZEL

           Um, no.

                          GUS

           As well you shouldn't.

          He smiles and for a brief moment it's old Gus. Hazel laughs.

          Isaac clears his throat.

                          ISAAC

           "Augustus Waters was a self-

           aggrandizing bastard. But we

           forgive him. We forgive him... not

           because he had a heart as

           figuratively good as his actual one

           sucked, or because he got 18 years

           when he should have gotten more."

                          GUS

           17.

                          ISAAC

           I'm assuming you've got some time,

           you interrupting bastard! I mean

           seriously...

           (back to the speech)

           "Augustus Waters talked so much

           that he'd interrupt you at his own

           funeral. And he was pretentious.

                          (MORE)

           102.

                          ISAAC (CONT'D)

           Sweet Jesus that kid never took a

           piss without pondering the

           resonances of human waste

           production. And he was vain. But

           that comes with superhuman

           handsomeness."

          Gus nods - that part is true.

                          ISAAC

           "But I will say this: when the

           scientists of the future show up at

           my house with robot eyes and they

           tell me to try them on, I will tell

           the scientists to piss off, because

           I don't even want to see a world

           without Augustus Waters."

          Hazel smiles - but it's one that triggers an immediate

          emotional waterfall.

                          ISAAC

           "And then, of course, having made

           my rhetorical point, I will put my

           robot eyes on because, I mean...

           robot eyes!"

          Gus has a big smile on his face.

                          ISAAC

           "So anyway, Augustus, my friend...

           Godspeed."

          Gus nods a couple times.

                          GUS

           Thank you Isaac.

          This causes Isaac to lose it. He clings to the lectern.

                          ISAAC

           Goddamn it, Gus.

                          GUS

           Hey don't swear in the Literal

           Heart of Jesus.

                          ISAAC

           Shit! Ass! Balls!

          Isaac sighs. Wipes away the tears. And another beat passes.

                          ISAAC

           Can I get a hand here, Hazel?

          Hazel remembers Isaac can't see. She rises, goes up to get

          him, walks him back to her seat.

                          GUS

           Hazel Grace, it's down to you.

           103.

          Hazel takes out a piece of paper, walks up to the dais. Takes

          a beat to ready herself.

                          HAZEL

           "Augustus Waters was the great star-

           crossed love of my life. Ours was

           an epic love story, and I won't be

           able to get more than a sentence

           into it without disappearing into a

           puddle of tears.

                          (BEAT)

           Like all real love stories - ours

           will die with us, as it should. I'd

           hoped that he'd be eulogizing me,

           because there's no one I'd rather

           have..."

          And that's all she can get out before falling apart. She lets

          it out for a couple beats and then pulls herself together.

                          HAZEL

           (beat, composing herself)

           "I can't talk about our love story

           so instead I will talk about math.

           I am not a mathematician, but I

           know this: there are infinite

           numbers between 0 and 1. There's .1

           And .12 And .112 And an infinite

           collection of others. Of course,

           there is a bigger infinite set of

           numbers between 0 and 2, or between

           0 and a million. Some infinities

           are bigger than other infinities. A

           writer we used to like taught us

           that. I want more numbers than I'm

           likely to get, and God, I want more

           numbers for Augustus Waters than he

           got. But, Gus, my love, I cannot

           tell you how thankful I am for our

           little infinity. You gave me a

           forever within the numbered days,

           and for that I am eternally

           grateful. I love you."

          Gus smiles, nods, and closes his eyes. CUT TO:

           BLACK.

          Over which we hear a RINGING TELEPHONE.

          INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Hazel turns on the LIGHT by her bed. Her HOUSE PHONE is

          ringing and it's 4am.

          She knows instantly.

           104.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           Augustus Waters died eight days

           later in the ICU...

          Hazel's head falls into her chest.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           ... when the cancer, which was made

           of him, stopped his heart, which

           was also made of him.

          Her bedroom door opens. It's Frannie and Michael. This only

          confirms her worst fears. She starts to cry. Her parents

          embrace her in the bed.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           It was unbearable. The whole thing.

           Every second worse than the last.

          EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - SAME

          Hazel sits in the car in the dark. She's blaring the loudest

          music she can possibly blare - a means of drowning out the

          horrors of the world. Over which we hear this:

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           One of the first things they ask

           you in the ER is to rate your pain

           on a scale from 1 to 10. I'd been

           asked this question hundreds of

           times and I remember once, early

           on, when I couldn't catch my breath

           and it felt like my chest was on

           fire, and the nurse asked me to

           rate the pain and though I couldn't

           speak, I held up 9 fingers.

          The loud music isn't protecting Hazel as well as she hoped.

          She falls apart nonetheless.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           Later on, when I'd been feeling

           better, the nurse came in and she

           called me a fighter. "You know how

           I know," she said. "Because you

           called a ten a nine."

          INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - ANOTHER MORNING

          Hazel puts on her funeral dress. She looks in the mirror.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           But that wasn't the truth. The

           reason I called it a nine was... I

           was saving my ten.

           105.

          INT CHURCH - DAY

          The place is filled today with mourners for Augustus Waters.

          Hazel comes in with her parents and stands in the back,

          watching people she's never seen before approach the Waters

          family and extend their deepest condolences.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           And this was it. The great and

           terrible ten.

          When Mr. and Mrs. Waters see Hazel, they open their arms.

           MRS. WATERS

           He loved you so much.

          Hazel nods. Hugs them back.

                          HAZEL

           He loved you so much too.

          More MOURNERS approach the family, leaving Hazel stranded in

          the receiving line. Her eyes turn towards the COFFIN. She's

          not entirely sure she wants to go there but she takes a deep

          breath, wills herself to walk towards it.

          Gus is there in the same suit he wore to Oranjee.

          Immediately, Hazel breaks down. And immediately, she catches

          herself.

                          HAZEL

           It's ok, you hear me? It's ok.

          She leans forward and kisses his cheek. She looks around.

          Once in the clear, she pulls out a hard pack of Camel Lights

          and sticks them in the space between Gus and the lining of

          the coffin. A MINISTER approaches at that moment.

                          MINISTER

           I think we're ready to begin.

          Hazel nods and walks back to her parents, taking her seat in

          the middle of the room.

                          MINISTER

           Augustus Waters fought hard for

           many years. His battle was a

           courageous one and his strength was

           a source of inspiration for each

           and every one of us...

          Hazel frowns. This is all such bullshit. And she hears:

                          MALE VOICE

           What a load of shit, eh kid?

          Hazel recognizes that voice. But it doesn't make sense. She

          turns around and, sure enough, it's Peter Van Houten.

           106.

                          MINISTER

           Let us pray.

          Everyone clasps their hands, closes their eyes. Hazel keeps

          staring at Van Houten, too shocked to do a thing.

                          VAN HOUTEN

           We need to fake pray now.

          Van Houten bows his head. Hazel, still stunned, slowly turns

          back to the Minister, trying to make sense of this unexpected

          appearance.

                          MINISTER

           Now I call on Augustus's close

           friend Isaac to say a few words.

          Isaac stands, walks up to the podium with someone's help.

          Hazel sneaks one more look at Van Houten. Yup, it's really

          him. That makes no sense to her. Isaac starts to speak.

                          ISAAC

           Of all the things I've lost in my

           life, this hurts the most.

          And Isaac stops talking. It's unclear if that was the end or

          if he just can't go on. He returns to his seat. The Minister

          walks back up.

                          MINISTER

           And now we'll hear from Gus's...

           special friend Hazel Lancaster.

          Hazel stands, walks up to the podium. A few titters in the

          room at the words "special friend."

                          HAZEL

           I was his girlfriend.

          Some laughter from the crowd. She takes out her notes.

                          HAZEL

           There's a beautiful quote in Gus's

           home that reads "if you want the

           rainbow, you gotta deal with the

           rain."

          Hazel continues to speak but we over it, WE HEAR instead:

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           I didn't believe a word, of course.

           But that was ok. Funerals, I'd

           decided, aren't for the dead.

           They're for the living.

          Gus's Parents, arm in arm, nod along with every word. CUT TO:

           107.

          EXT CEMETARY - DAY

          Everyone is watching Gus's body be lowered into the ground.

          Everyone but Hazel. She looks off into the distance.

          Off to the side, we see Van Houten, also not watching the

          burial. He's watching Hazel. CUT TO:

          LATER. Ceremony over, we see Hazel with her parents.

                          HAZEL

           I'll be fine.

                          FRANNIE

           Are you sure? We can drive you --

                          HAZEL

           No, I'd... I'd like to be alone for

           a while.

          Hazel hugs Mom and Dad, walks alone towards the parking lot.

          As she gets to the car, Van Houten approaches.

                          VAN HOUTEN

           Could I hitch a ride?

          Hazel doesn't want to help this man.

                          VAN HOUTEN

           Just to the bottom of the hill.

          Hazel exhales. Fine. Once they're both in the car:

                          HAZEL

           How did you even --

                          VAN HOUTEN

           The internet.

                          HAZEL

           And you just... bought a ticket?

                          VAN HOUTEN

           The drinks are free drinks in First

           Class.

          Van Houten removes a FLASK from his coat pocket. Takes a

          swig. Hazel shakes her head in disgust. Starts driving.

                          VAN HOUTEN

           Omnis Cellula e cellula.

          Hazel ignores him.

                          VAN HOUTEN

           Your boy Waters and I corresponded

           quite a bit in his last --

                          HAZEL

           You read your fan mail now?

           108.

                          VAN HOUTEN

           I would hardly call him a fan. He

           despised me. But he was quite

           insistent I attend his funeral and

           tell you what became of Anna and

           her mother. So here I am and that's

           your answer: omnis cellula e

           cellula.

                          HAZEL

           I'm so not in the mood --

                          VAN HOUTEN

           "Life comes from life."

                          HAZEL

           Goodbye Mr. Van Houten.

                          VAN HOUTEN

           You don't want an explanation?

                          HAZEL

           Nope. Thanks though. Have a great

           life.

                          VAN HOUTEN

           You remind me of her.

                          HAZEL

                          (BEAT)

           I remind a lot of people of a lot

           of people.

                          VAN HOUTEN

           She was eight, my daughter. She

           suffered... beautifully. For so

           long.

          Hazel starts to understand Van Houten - and softens.

                          HAZEL

           She had leukemia? Like Anna?

                          VAN HOUTEN

           Just like her, yes.

                          HAZEL

           Were you married then?

                          VAN HOUTEN

           Not when she died, no. I was

           insufferable long before Anna, my

           dear. Grief doesn't change you,

           Hazel, it reveals you.

          Hazel takes that in.

                          HAZEL

           Well I'm sorry for your loss.

           109.

                          VAN HOUTEN

           And I'm sorry for yours. I'm sorry

           for everything, for being so rude

           to you two, for ruining your trip --

                          HAZEL

           You didn't ruin our trip, you

           asshole. We had an awesome trip.

                          VAN HOUTEN

           Hazel, I'm trying. I'm trying! You

           asked me to tell you what happens

           and I wish I could do that. I wish

           that I could. But I can't. No one

           can. No one knows, Hazel. They

           don't talk to us. Unless...

          Van Houten takes out a typed piece of paper. He hands it to

          Hazel who grabs it - and immediately crumples it into a ball.

                          HAZEL

           You think I care about that? I

           don't give a shit, Van Houten.

          Hazel throws the piece of paper at Van Houten.

                          HAZEL

           You're a drunk and a jerk and a

           failure. And I'd like you to get

           out of my car right now so I can go

           home and grieve.

                          VAN HOUTEN

                          (STUNNED)

                          BUT --

                          HAZEL

           Get out of the car!

          Van Houten knows he's too late. He does as he's told,

          stepping out of the car onto the side of the road. He stands

          there as Hazel peels out.

          In the rearview mirror, she sees him raise the FLASK, as if

          toasting her. She blinks away some tears and drives. CUT TO:

          INT HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Hazel lies in front of the TV. "Top Model" is playing but

          she's lost in her own world. Tears fall from her eyes and she

          can't do anything to stop it. Hazel gets up.

          INT BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Hazel sits against the tub on the floor and weeps. Soon

          there's a knock.

           110.

                          HAZEL

                          (THROUGH TEARS)

           Occupada.

           MICHAEL (O.S.)

           Can I come in?

          Hazel leans over and unlocks the door. Michael kneels down

          next to her, putting her head on his shoulder.

          Hazel presses her face into his shirt and cries some more.

          Michael squeezes her tightly. And this time, he doesn't cry.

                          MICHAEL

           I'm so so sorry.

                          (BEAT)

           It was a privilege to love him,

           though, wasn't it?

          Hazel nods into his shirt. Then looks up at her Dad.

                          MICHAEL

           Gives you an idea how we feel about

           you.

          Michael smiles at Hazel. And he doesn't cry. Hazel draws

          strength from him.

          EXT ISAAC'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Hazel and Isaac have climbed through his open bedroom window.

          They sit on the roof.

                          ISAAC

           Do you know if it hurt or whatever?

                          HAZEL

           He was really fighting for breath,

           I guess. He eventually went

           unconscious, but it seems like,

           yeah, it wasn't great or anything.

           Dying sucks.

                          ISAAC

                          (LONG BEAT)

           It just seems so impossible.

                          HAZEL

           Happens all the time.

                          ISAAC

           Are you angry?

                          HAZEL

           Very.

           111.

                          ISAAC

           Me too.

           (a few beats)

           Gus really loved you, you know.

                          HAZEL

           I know.

                          ISAAC

           He wouldn't shut up about it.

                          HAZEL

           I know.

                          ISAAC

           It was annoying.

                          HAZEL

           I didn't find it that annoying.

          They sit there in silence a few beats.

                          ISAAC

           Did you read the note or whatever

           from your author friend?

                          HAZEL

           He is not my friend and -- how do

           you know about that?

                          ISAAC

           We talked at the cemetery. Said he

           came all this way to give you that.

                          HAZEL

           Yeah well I'm over it. I never want

           to read another word of that

           asshole's again.

                          ISAAC

           Yeah but he didn't write it - Gus

           did.

                          HAZEL

                          (STUNNED)

           What?

                          ISAAC

           That's what he said. Gus had

           written something, sent it to Van

                          HOUTEN --

          Hazel sits up. Her heart is racing.

                          ISAAC

           What?

                          HAZEL

           I... I have to go. I... Are you...?

           112.

                          ISAAC

           I do it all the time. Go.

          As quickly as possible Hazel leaves. Isaac stays behind,

          enjoying the cool night. A new day is coming.

          INT/ EXT HAZEL'S CAR - DAY

          Hazel is inside the car, rummaging crazily through the trash

          in an effort to find what Van Houten gave her. She's about to

          give up when she sees it - crumpled up into a ball beneath

          the passenger's seat. She reaches under, pulls it up, and

          unwraps it. As she reads, WE HEAR:

                          GUS'S VOICE

           Mr. Van Houten, I'm a good person

           but a shitty writer. You're a

           shitty person but a good writer.

           We'd make a good team. I don't want

           to ask you any favors but if you

           have the time, and from what I saw

           you have plenty, please fix this

           for me. It's a eulogy for Hazel.

          Hazel is overcome with emotion.

                          GUS'S VOICE

           She asked me to write one and I'm

           trying, I just, I could use a

           little flair. See the thing is...

           we all want to be remembered.

          She smiles to herself, remembering:

          - That first time Gus and Hazel ran into each other.

          - The staring contest in Support Group.

                          GUS'S VOICE

           We all want to leave a mark.

          - Driving (badly) in Gus's car.

          - Their first kiss at the picnic by "Funky Bones."

                          GUS'S VOICE

           But not Hazel. Hazel is different.

           Hazel knows the truth. She didn't

           want a million admirers, she just

           wanted one. And she got it. Maybe

           she wasn't loved widely but she was

           loved deeply. And isn't that more

           than most of us get?

          - And BACK TO HAZEL reading the letter, tears in her eyes.

                          GUS'S VOICE

           When Hazel was sick, I knew I was

           dying. But I didn't want to say so.

           113.

          INT ICU - FLASHBACK

          Gus stealthily sneaks into Hazel's single room in the ICU.

          She sleeps. He kneels by her side.

                          GUS'S VOICE

           She was in ICU and I snuck in for

           ten minutes and sat with her before

           I got caught. Her eyes were closed,

           her lungs were intubated...

          Gus takes her hand and holds it.

                          GUS'S VOICE

           ... but her hands were still her

           hands, still warm, and the nails

           painted this dark blue back color

           and I just held her hands and I

           willed myself to imagine a world

           without us and what a worthless

           world that would be.

          - AND BACK TO HAZEL reading the letter. She never knew that

          story, never knew he was there. CUT TO:

          EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - LATER

          Hazel walks out to the grass behind her house, the oxygen

          tank dragging behind her. She lays down on the grass and

          looks up at the stars - the same IMAGE that opened the movie.

                          GUS'S VOICE

           She's so beautiful. You don't get

           tired of looking at her. You never

           worry if she's smarter than you

           cause you know she is. She's funny

           without ever being mean.

                         SHE REMEMBERS:

          - The magical dinner at Oranjee.

          - The bench in which they sat overlooking the water.

          - The passionate kiss in Anne Frank's house.

          - Falling onto the bed together.

          [All of these are images we saw at the beginning of the

          movie, only now, we SEE the oxygen tank, we SEE Gus's leg, we

          SEE the fumbling and the difficulties etc. They don't make

          these images less beautiful. They make them twice as

          beautiful - because they're real.]

                          GUS'S VOICE

           I love her, god I love her. I'm so

           lucky to love her, Van Houten.

                          (MORE)

           114.

           GUS'S VOICE (CONT'D)

           You don't get to choose if you get

           hurt in this world but you do have

           a say in who hurts you.

          - AND BACK ON Hazel in the grass. She holds the letter to her

          chest. A single tear falls onto her cheeks.

                          GUS'S VOICE

           I like my choices. I hope she likes

           hers.

          Hazel CLOSES HER EYES.

                          GUS'S VOICE

           Ok, Hazel Grace?

          A beat. Another.

          Hazel OPENS HER EYES. And she says to the universe:

                          HAZEL

           Ok.

           BLACK.
