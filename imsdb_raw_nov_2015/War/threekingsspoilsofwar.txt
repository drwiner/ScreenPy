     President Bush in the Oval Office delivering an address to

                          PRESIDENT BUSH

                ...This act of naked aggression must be

                checked.  The United States, along with

                coalition forces from the Middle East,

                have drawn a line in the sand.  There is

                only one way for this situation to be

                satisfactorily resolved.  The belligerent

                forces from the Republic of Iraq must be

                removed from Kuwait, be it by choice, or

                by force...

     EXT. DESERT - DAY

     From a distance we see a Humvee sitting alone in the middle

     of a huge, empty desert.  Just the Humvee, nothing else for

     miles.  We hear the sound of a man making machine gun-like

     noises.

                          JAEGER (V.O.)

                At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     CU - HUMVEE

     There are three soldiers at the Humvee.  Second Lieutenant

     JOHN EPPS,                   who sweeps the horizon with a

     pair of binoculars.  PFC WES HAMMOND, who is behind the wheel

     looking very bored, and PFC MARK JAEGER, who is at the

     Humvee's thirty caliber machine gun, making the noises and

     shooting at phantom troops.  When Jaeger talks it's with all

     the swagger of a B-movie hero.

                          JAEGER

                At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.

                          EPPS

                What are you doing?

                          JAEGER 

                What does it look like I'm doing?  I'm 

                killing Iraqis.  At-at-at-at-at.  At-at- 

                at-at-- 

                          WES 

                Could you stop, please.  You're giving me

                a headache. 

                          JAEGER

                A headache? 

                          WES 

                Yeah, a headache.  My head hurts.  You're

                making me uncomfortable. 

                          JAEGER 

                I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking 

                away in a desert in the middle of nowhere

                facing three-hundred-thousand screaming 

                Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that

                doesn't bother you.  But me making a 

                little noise is driving you out of your

                skull. 

                          WES 

                Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Yes. 

                          JAEGER

                Okay. 

     Jaeger goes right back to playing soldier. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)

                At-at-at-at-at. 

                          EPPS

                Knock it off! 

                          JAEGER 

                Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I 

                want to be ready when this war starts.

                          EPPS 

                Ready for what?  What are you supposed to

                be doing? 

                          JAEGER

                I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis. 

                          EPPS

                No you're not. 

     Epps points in the opposite direction that Jaeger was 

     'firing.'

                          EPPS(CONT) 

                The Iraqis are that way.  Those are our

                troops you're shooting at. 

     With his binoculars Epps looks in the direction Jaeger was

     shooting. 

                          EPPS(CONT) 

                You know what?  I think you got 

                Schwarzkopf.  You did!  You got the 

                General right in the ass.  Now that's

                good shooting. 

                          JAEGER

                Blow me. 

                          EPPS 

                Another month in this desert and I might

                just. 

                          WES 

                Think we're going to do it?  Think we're

                going to war? 

                          EPPS 

                Not up to us.  Up to the Iraqis.  All

                they have to do is get out of Kuwait. 

                          JAEGER 

                We ought to kick their asses anyway.

                Even if they do get out of Kuwait we

                ought to kick their asses. 

                          WES 

                I don't think we'll go to war.  We 

                shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our

                fight, it's a regional conflict.  It

                should be decided regionally. 

                          JAEGER 

                People are suffering. 

                          WES

                People were suffering in Afganistan, and

                we didn't do anything.

                          EPPS 

                That's 'cause the Afganis weren't smart

                enough to be sitting on top of oil. 

                People suffering is one thing, but when

                the Yuppies aren't going to have enough 

                gas for their BMWs it's time to break out

                the tanks.  Come on.  Pack up.  We've got

                a whole lot of nothing to patrol. 

     As they pack up and get ready to roll on Jaeger says almost

     to himself:

                          JAEGER 

                We ought to kick their asses.  Either way

                we ought to.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. STREET BAZAAR - EVENING 

     The bazaar is loud and colorful, a cacophony of Arabic fills 

     the air.  The bazaar is filled with vendors actively selling

     their wares to each passerby, literally shoving them in the

     faces of prospective customers. 

     Epps, Wes and Jaeger walk along side by side looking almost

     like the Three Musketeers, except that Wes is droning on. 

                          WES 

                ...And it's very important when you sit

                down never to point the soles of your

                shoes at anyone.  It's considered

                offensive. 

                          EPPS 

                You know so much about the Middle East,

                you know where we can get something to

                eat. 

                          JAEGER 

                When do you ever point the soles of your

                feet at people? 

                          WES 

                I'm saying don't do it accidently. 

                          JAEGER 

                Oh yeah.  Accidently. 

     Jaeger lifts his leg and purposefully points the bottom of

     his foot at a vendor. 

                          JAEGER(CONT) 

                I'm sorry.  My foot accidently jumped up 

                in the air where you could see the bottom

                of it.  I hate it when that happens.

     (Wes slaps Jaeger's leg down.) 

                          WES 

                Come on.  You're going to get us in

                trouble. 

                          JAEGER 

                It was an accident.  You saw it was an

                accident. 

                          WES 

                I'm just trying to help you guys out.  It

                doesn't hurt to know something about

                Saudi Arabia.

                          EPPS 

                Like learning Arabic?  You're gonna learn

                Arabic you might as well learn were we

                can get something to eat around here. 

                          WES 

                I didn't learn Arabic because we were 

                getting shipped here.  You don't learn it

                in a couple of weeks.  I studied it in

                high school. 

                          JAEGER

                Spanish wasn't hard enough? 

                          WES 

                I thought it would be good to know. 

                          JAGER 

                Yeah, if you ever need to buy a rug. 

                          WES 

                Hey, Jaeger.  Why don't you try this:

Ashra Ka mahari dahra sahib.

                          JAEGER 

                What does that mean? 

                          WES 

                Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can

                use that when you surrender.

                          JAEGER 

                How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm

                horny."  I can use that now. 

                          WES 

                Don't even try it.  You offend a woman

                out here you're in serious trouble.

                          EPPS 

                Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his

                personality as a form of birth control. 

                          JAEGER 

                Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys

                recently?  Blow me. 

     As Epps and Wes walk on Jaeger notices something on a 

     VENDOR'S table.  It is a small, square box - slightly larger

     than a man's palm - fashioned of wood and metal.  It is not

     particularly ornate, but eye catching in its own way.  The

     instant Jaeger picks it up and begins to look it over the

     Vendor is giving him the hard sell in Arabic.  Jaeger holds

     the box up to the vendor. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)

                What is this? 

     All he gets is more Arabic.  Jaeger calls over to Wes. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)

                Hey, Wes.  Wes! 

     Wes comes back over to Jaeger. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)

                What is this? 

                          WES 

                Now you need me.

                          JAEGER 

                What is it?  You know so much about

                Arabland tell me what it is. 

     Wes looks over the box carefully. 

                          WES 

                Well, based on my knowledge of the 

                region, its culture and her people I

                would have to say it's a box. 

                          EPPS 

                Can you eat it?  If you can't eat it I

                really don't care what it is. 

                          JAEGER 

                Ask him what it is.

     Wes says something to the vendor in Arabic.  The Vendor

     answers back. 

                          WES 

                He says it's a box. 

                          JAEGER 

                Yeah, you're funny. 

                          WES 

                It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out

                how to open it there's supposed to be a

                treasure inside.

                          JAEGER

                     (Excited)

                For real?  A treasure? 

                          EPPS 

                Oh, man, you're not going to fall for

                that. 

                          JAEGER 

                There might be something in there. 

                          EPPS 

                Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge. 

                          JAEGER

                There might be. 

                          WES 

                And you're the guy who's going to open 

                it.

                          JAEGER

                I could. 

                          EPPS 

                You could turn on a light if someone put 

                your hand on the switch. 

     Decisively, without even haggling about price, Jaeger whips

     out some money and pays the vendor for the box.

                          EPPS(CONT) 

                Well, that showed me.  Now, can we eat? 

     The three men walk on, Jaeger starting to work on the puzzle box. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT 

     It's filled with young soldiers messing around, playing 

     cards, listening to music, whatever.  Jaeger lays on a bunk

     holding the puzzle box, probing it with his fingers, trying

     to find a way to make it open. 

     Wes crosses over. 

                          WES 

                You get it yet? 

                          JAEGER 

                Naw, nothing. 

                          WES 

                You will.  You'll get it. 

                          JAEGER 

                I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I

                get this thing open. 

                          WES 

                You really think there's a treasure

                inside? 

                          JAEGER 

                I don't care if there's a lump of coal in

                here.  I just want to be able to rub 

                Epps' face in it when I crack this thing. 

     Wes watches Jaeger work the box for a beat.

                          WES

                Jaeger? 

                          JAEGER

                What? 

                          WES 

                You know the fifteenth is the deadline

                for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait. 

                          JAEGER 

                Yeah.  So? 

                          WES 

                That's in two days.

                          JAEGER

                Like I said; so?

                          JAEGER 

                What's your point, Wes?  You have a

                point? 

                          WES 

                We're going to war, aren't we.  If 

                they're doing all that it must mean we're

                going to war. 

                          JAEGER 

                It doesn't mean anything. 

                          WES 

                Why would they do all that if we weren't? 

     Jaeger, frustrated, finally looks up from his box. 

                          JAEGER 

                Okay, so we're going to war.  We're 

                supposed to go to war.  We're soldiers, 

                that's what we do.  The guns, the tanks,

                the planes; you're just now getting the

                hint we're in the war business? 

     Jaeger goes back to his box.  Wes stands over him for a beat

     longer, then: 

                          WES

                Jaeger? 

                          JAEGER 

                     (For sure aggravated)

                What!?

                          WES 

                You ever think about dying? 

                          JAEGER 

                Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open. 

                          WES 

                You ever think about it?  You ever worry? 

                          JAEGER 

                The only thing I worry about is how much

                Iraqi ass I'm going to be able to kick

                before this whole thing is over.  The 

                only people who I've got anything to worry

                about are the poor, dumb camel jockeys 

                who don't know enough to get out of the 

                way when I come rolling at them; an M-16

                in each hand, and a grenade between my 

                teeth.  Now if you'll excuse me, soldier,

                I'd like to get back to my box.  I've got

                a treasure to find. 

     Wes lingers over Jaeger for a few more beats, then walks off as we:

     CNN footage of the air war on a Watchman.

     Jaeger gets down from the machine gun, pulls out his puzzle

     box and starts to work on it again. 

                          JAEGER 

                This is stupid.  It's going on a month 

                now.  How long are they going to let the

                can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't

                I've got to have something to tell people

                when I get home besides I protected a 

                stretch of dirt that nobody wanted for

                nothing in the first place. 

                          WES 

                The longer the air force hits the Iraqis,

                the safer it'II be for us when we have to

                engage. 

                          JAEGER 

                You know what, Wes?  If you get a note

                from your mommy they might excuse you

                from the war. 

                          EPPS 

                You all want to lay off?  God.  I hope

                the Iraqis shoot me; put me out of my

                OH MY GOD! 

     Startled, Epps and Wes each pull their guns and spin in 

     Jaeger's direction expecting to have to fire at something. 

                          EPPS

                What!?  What!? 

                          JAEGER 

                I did it!  I got the box open. 

     Jaeger has indeed opened the box.  We can see something

     inside of it. 

                          EPPS 

                You almost got yourself shot, that's

                what you did. 

     Wes excitedly goes over to Jaeger. 

                          WES 

                What's inside? 

     Jaeger pulls out a small tube sealed with wax.

                          JAEGER 

                It's...it's...I don't know what it is. 

                          WES 

                It's a container.  Break the seal. 

     Jaeger hesitates a beat, which heightens a bit of suspense.

     All three men can't help but be drawn closer to the container. 

                          EPPS

                Go on, man. 

     Jaeger pokes his finger through the wax and pulls it off the

     tube.  He sticks his finger back into the container and draws

     out a rolled up piece of paper. 

                          WES

                Paper. 

                          EPPS 

                It's a fortune box. 

     Jaeger unrolls it.

                          EPPS 

                Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle

                box factory. 

     We see the paper.  Lines are drawn on it, large, crude 

     figures.  It's hard to make out exactly what it all is

     supposed to represent. 

                          JAEGER 

                It's a drawing, or something.  Some kind

                of art. 

     Epps takes the paper from Jaeger and gives it a once over. 

                          EPPS 

                Looks like something a kid would do. 

     Wes takes the paper and looks it over.

                          WES 

                It's a map, I think that's what it is.

                          EPPS 

                There you go, Jaeger.  Just find the

                buried treasure, and you're a

                millionaire. 

     Jaeger takes back the paper.  All excited like a kid on

     Christmas:

                          JAEGER

                You think? 

                          EPPS 

                Yeah, that's exactly what I think.  You

                and the five thousand other suckers who

                bought those boxes.  Let's get out of

                here.  We got sand to protect. 

     Epps and Wes load up and get ready to move out.  Jaeger just

     keeps staring at the map, eyes lit like candles.

     They're posted on the walls with various levels of troop 

     strength - allied and Iraqi - indicated.  More data is 

     constantly flowing in, analyzed and processed.

                          JAEGER 

                I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of

                Iraqi. 

                          WOODS 

                A map?  All I got is maps.  I'm gonna 

                have Delayed Map Syndrome when I finally

                get out of here.  What kind of map you

                need?  Topographical, geographical,

                thermal?

                          JAGER

                I don't know.  A map map. 

                          WOODS

                A map map. 

     Woods pulls out a map and hands it to Jaeger.

                          WOODS(CONT)

                That shouldn't be too hard to read.  Iraq

                is the pink thing. 

                          JAEGER 

                I could use some recon photos too. 

     Woods gives Jaeger a sideways glance.

                          WOODS 

                Planning on going to war all by your lonesome? 

                          JAEGER 

                Just...want to be ready when we do.

                Ready for what?  Sight-seeing? 

                          JAEGER

                The photos. 

     Woods starts to dig for photos. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)

                Some good ones. 

                          WOODS 

                They're all good ones.  Satellites we've

                got can snap a shot of the boil on

                Saddam's ass. 

                          JAEGER 

                Saddam's got a boil on his ass? 

     Woods looks up at Jaeger with an expression that says:

     "What?"

                          JAEGER(CONT)

                I don't know. 

     Woods goes back to looking, pulls some photos and hands them

     to Jaeger.

                          JAEGER(CONT) 

                Thanks, man.  Appreciate it. 

     Staring at the pictures like they held the secrets of the

     ages Jaeger starts to exit.  Woods mumbles after him: 

                          WOODS 

                Yeah.  You figure out how to win the war

                be sure to let us know.

     INT. BARRACKS - LATER 

     Maps and photos cover Jaeger's bunk the way autumn leaves 

     cover the ground.  He swings between studying the maps, and

     reading from a book titled A History Of The Ottoman Empire.

     Jaeger puts the book down, then slides the drawing from the

     puzzle box up next to one of the recon photos.  He looks at

     the mosaic he's put together, looks at it like it was having

     a dialogue with him.  Dig it:  It is talking.  A voice only

     Jaeger can hear.  Right now it's just a little whisper, but

     the voice is getting louder. 

     A crossing SOLDIER, carrying a football, calls to Jaeger.

                          SOLDIER 

                Come on, Jaeger.  We're playing ball.

     Jaeger fairly jumps as he comes out of his trance.

                No that's okay.  I'm gonna...I'm doing some...

     The soldier crosses off.  Jaeger goes back to staring at his

     maps, and photos and drawings and books.  "What were you

     saying?"

     As it all keeps talking to him we:

     Jaeger and Epps come around to Wes' Watchman.  We see CNN

     footage of some Iraqi soldiers - looking very tired, hungry

     and scared - surrendering to a CNN news crew. 

                          WES{CONT) 

                They're surrendering to a news crew.  You

                believe that?

     Jaeger tosses his hands in the air in defeat. 

                          JAEGER 

                That's it.  It's over.  Eighteen hours

                into the war and it's over. 

                          WES 

                Those soldiers have got loafers on.  What

                kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?

                          EPPS

                A casual one.

                          WES 

                Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be

                home in no time. 

                          EPPS 

                Better grab up some sand to take home to

                your family.

     Jaeger bites at his lip.  He wants to say something, but 

     isn't quite sure how, if he should, if...  Fuck that, Jaeger.

     Just say it. 

                          JAEGER 

                We...we could go home with something

                else. 

                          WES

                What? 

                          JAEGER 

                With...with millions.  Millions of

                dollars. 

                          EPPS 

                What are you talking about?

     Jaeger pulls out the drawing from the puzzle box.

                          EPPS(CONT) 

                Don't even.  You're not going to show me

                that tired map. 

                          JAEGER

                Wait.  Wait. 

     Jaeger starts to tear at his pockets like he's trying to get

     at a bee.  He pulls out his other maps, recon photos...  The

     guy's a walking atlas.

     Epps looks on in shock at the spectacle. 

                          EPPS 

                I think you've got some issues to deal

                with.  Really, when we get out of here 

                I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you. 

                          JAEGER 

                Just listen to me!  I've been doing some

                reading.  In the Sixteenth century this

                region was invaded by the Turks.  It 

                became part of the Ottoman empire.  When

                the Turks rolled in they raped, they 

                pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who 

                had anything wanted to hide it from these

                bastards.  They buried their treasures,

                drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle 

                boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read

                about it. 

                          EPPS 

                     (Sarcastic) 

                Wellllll, if you read it it must be true.

                Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer? 

                          JAEGER 

                Christ!  Wes, tell him.  You know this

                stuff. 

                          WES 

                The Turks invaded, yeah. I guess people

                would have hidden what they had.  But 

                that doesn't mean what was in that box

                is-- 

     Jager holds up the puzzle box drawing to one of the maps.

                          JAEGER 

                Looks at this!  Look at it!  The drawing

                is a map of this area right here.  You

                can see it.  The geography, the

                landmarks.  It's the same area. 

     Epps grabs the map from Jaeger.

                          EPPS 

                And you know what that area is?  It's

                Iraq.  IRAQ!  We're doing a little thing 

                with them right now; Desert Storm.  Maybe

                you've read about it. 

                          JAEGER 

                What we're doing is kicking ass.  For 

                God's sake they got Iraqis surrendering

                to news crews.  The war is over.  We've

                just got to keep shooting people 'cause 

                the army spent all this money, and we've

                got to put on a show for the taxpayers. 

                          WES 

                You're not saying what I think you're

                saying.  I can't believe you're even

                thinking it. 

                          JAEGER 

                It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf.

                I got recon photos.  There're no troops

                there, no fighting-- 

                          WES 

                You don't know where the Iraqis have 

                moved to.  And our forces haven't even

                engaged the Republican Guard yet, we 

                don't know--

                          JAEGER 

                It's about a hundred miles from where we

                are now.  How long do you think it would

                take us to-- 

                          WES 

                It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred

                miles through three different kinds of 

                terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a

                river.  If the map is even real. 

                          JAEGER 

                It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real. 

                          WES 

                So you just want to cross into hostile 

                territory in the middle of a war on a 

                wild goose chase?  It's crazy.  Tell him

                it's crazy, Epps. 

     Epps thinks.  He doesn't say nuthin', just thinks.  It's the

     thinking that makes Wes nervous.

                          WES(CONT)

                Epps, tell him. 

     Epps gets a little more thinking in.  Wes sees which way this

     is going. 

                          WES 

                You're out of your minds, you know that?

                Both of you.  You don't even know if 

                there's anything out there.  What the

                hell are you thinking? 

                          EPPS 

                I'm thinking about when this war is over.

                Why you figure I'm here?  'Cause I got

                tired of being president of GM?  If a

                brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs 

                there aren't too many big money prospects

                around, and I'm not particularly 

                interested in spending the rest of my 

                life fighting the oil companies' wars.

                So I say if maybe there's something out 

                there, what the hell, that's what I say. 

     Wes can't believe what he's hearing.  He pulls out the last

     card he has to play. 

                          WES 

                It's desertion.

     Jaeger sweeps a hand across the great nothingness.

                          JAEGER 

                Deserting what?  What the hell are we

                deserting? 

     Both Jaeger and Epps close on Wes for the hard sell. 

                          EPPS 

                It's war.  People get lost all the time

                in war, cut off--

                          JAEGER 

                We disappear for awhile.  We disappear,

                we came back; nobody knows nothing. 

                          EPPS 

                But we all got to be in for this.  We all

                go, or we do nothing. 

                          WES 

                Epps, you're smarter than this.  Jaeger I

                understand, but you're smarter. 

                          JAEGER 

                You know it's real.  You know it's real,

                and you know it's there.  You know it. 

                          WES 

                You're insane if you think you'll find

                anything, and sure insane if you think

                you can get us there and back alive. 

                          EPPS 

                If you say that, then I say you don't 

                know Second Lieutenant Epps very well, do

                you? 

     Wes buries his head in his hands.  He squeezes at it hard 

     like he'd rather make his brains ooze out his ears than say

     what he's going to say. 

                          WES 

                God!  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I

                don't. 

                          JAEGER

                Yes! 

                          EPPS 

                It's going to be cool, Wes.  It's all all

                right.

                          JAEGER 

                We go, we get rich, we go home.  It's

                that easy. 

     Jaeger and Epps start to pack up.  To no one in particular,

     and not too convincingly Wes mutters. 

                          WES 

                Yeah.  That easy. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. DESERT - LATER 

     To strains of Hendrix's Wait Until Tomorrow the Humvee cuts 

     across the desert kicking up plumes of loose sand.  It looks

     more a dune buggy out for a joy ride than a military vehicle. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     I/E. HUMVEE - SIMULTANEOUS 

     Epps drives, Jaeger rides shotgun, relaxed, feet up on the 

     dash.  Wes is in back with a "what the fuck did I get myself

     into look on his face."  The Hendrix comes from a Walkman 

     hooked up to a pair of small speakers.  Basically these guys 

     are just kicking it.  War?  What war?  Our boys are just on a

     beer run.  Maybe this wasn't such a bad idea after all. 

                          EPPS 

                Now this is war. 

                          JAEGER

                Roger that. 

                          WES 

                We're going to get court martialed, you

                know that. 

                          JAEGER 

                Hell, we'll just buy our way out. 

     Epps picks up a map and gives it a read.  To Jaeger he says:

                          EPPS 

                Hand me the navicom.

     Jaeger hands Epps a piece of electronic hardware no bigger

     than a video box.  It's a navigational computer which can

     pinpoint its location, by satellite, within meters. 

     Basically the ultimate compass.  Epps compares the navicom's

     readout with the map. 

                          EPPS(CONT)

                Hold on boys and girls...hold on... 

     Epps watches the navicom...watches it... 

                          EPPS(CONT)

                Yeah!  Welcome to beautiful Iraq.  Land

                of enchantment and riches.

                          WES

                Oh, God. 

                          JAEGER 

                You're such a pussy, you know that?

                How'd you get in the army? 

                          EPPS 

                Cool it, Jaeger.  Hey, Wes?  Wes? 

                          WES

                What? 

                          EPPS 

                I know you think this is crazy, but a 

                couple of hours from now you're going to

                be one rich dude trying to buy up every

                other puzzle box out there. 

                          WES 

                I'd settle for being alive.  Really.

                Alive would be fine. 

                          JAEGER 

                Epps, is that a sand dune. 

                          WES 

                Oh, no. 

                          EPPS 

                Why, yes, Jaeger.  I believe it is. 

                          WES 

                No, please, not again. 

     Epps punches the accelerator and the Humvee jumps forward

     like a horse out of the gate.

                Nooooooooo! 

     As gravity takes hold and brings the Hummer back to earth we:

     The occupants jostle as the Hummer touches down.  Epps and

     looking sick. 

                          JAEGER

                Hey, Wes, what kind of treasure you

                figure these people buried? 

                          WES 

                If!  If there's a treasure. 

                          JAEGER 

                Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you

                figure it is? 

                          WES 

                I don't know.  It would be small, easy to

                transport and hide.  Gold or jewels.

                Probably gold.

                          JAEGER 

                Yeah!  Gold!  How much? 

                          WES 

                How the hell should I know how much? 

                          EPPS 

                But that's the great thing about Gold.  A

                little goes a long way. 

                          JAEGER 

                You know what I'm doing with my part of

                          JAEGER 

                You know what I'm doing with my half? 

     Epps turns to Jaeger.  There's just the slightest, slightest

     hint of edge brushed across his tone.

                          JAEGER 

                Yeah.  I meant... You know what I'm going

                to do with it?  I'm going to buy a Sixty-

                three 'Vette Stingray.  All tricked out

                and cherry.  I'm going to be so sweet. 

                          EPPS 

                A car?  You're going to buy a car? 

                          WES 

                This is too much.  You don't even have

                the money and you're wasting it. 

                          JAEGER 

                A car is not just a car where I come 

                from.  I had this friend, had this wicked

                candy apple red Sixty-four and a half

                Mustang-- 

                          EPPS 

                You're getting gold, and you're going to 

                blow it on wheels? 

                          JAEGER 

                What are you going to do with your 

third

? 

                          EPPS

                Invest it. 

                          JAEGER

                Oh, that's fun. 

                          EPPS 

                It's not about being fun.  It's about 

                being smart.  You take that money, you

                take care of it, let it grow, and you 

                don't ever have to do anything again. 

                Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm

                talking about.

                          JAEGER 

                And I'm talking about enjoying myself.

                          EPPS 

                You know, you sound just like a boy who's

                never-- 

                          WES

                What's that? 

     Jaeger and Epps look out the front windshield.  A plume of

     sand rises up from the desert several hundred meters before

     them.  So engrossed in their discussion previously they

     hadn't even noticed until Wes pointed it out. 

     Epps reaches over and kills the tape player.  A loud quiet

     comes with it.  All three men just stare at the plume as it

     drifts closer.  Finally: 

                          EPPS 

                Take the binoculars.

                          JAEGER

                Wh-what do you think--

                          EPPS

                TAKE THE GODDAMN BINOCULARS!

     Jaeger scrambles up the binoculars, and stares off into the

     distance.  Epps and Wes wait...they wait... 

                          JAEGER 

                Iraqis. 

                          WES

                Oh, God! 

                          JAEGER 

                Two vehicles.  They're not supposed to be

                here. 

                          WES

                Oh, Jesus! 

                          JAEGER 

                They're not...I had the pictures.

                They're not supposed to be here! 

                          EPPS 

                Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up! 

                          JAEGER 

                We've got to do something.  We've got to

                turn around.

                          EPPS 

                We can see them, they can see us.  We

                run, they chase.

                          WES

                What are we going to do? 

     Epps thinks.  Thinking's not good enough for Wes.

                          WES(CONT) 

                What are we going to do!? 

                          EPPS 

                We're going to keep driving. 

                          JAEGER

                They'll shoot us! 

                          EPPS 

                We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we

                keep driving they might think we 

                friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know

                we're Americans they might get scared, 

                think we're part of a detachment and keep

                on going. 

                          JAEGER 

                They're not going to-- 

                          EPPS 

                It's the only way.  We drive!

     Epps is right.  Jaeger and Wes know it.  They shut up and 

     ride.  Dig that tension:  Wes sweating, Epps giving the wheel

     a white knuckle grip.  Jaeger reaches down and readies his M-

     16.  When he chambers it, it sounds like thunder cracking. 

     The plume draws closer and closer until it's not just a 

     plume, but two dots.  Then it's two jeep-like vehicles.  Next

     we can even make out the passengers.

     That doesn't do much to relax our boys.

     Us, the Iraqis, we're almost on top of each other now.  The

     vehicles are going to pass within feet.  Epps throws in one

     more thing:

                          EPPS 

                Wave at them.  Don't look, just wave.

     All three throw up some weak, forced waves.  THE VEHICLES

     PASS.  Look at that:  The Iraqis are waving back.  And that's 

     all they're doing, just waving.

     Our boys break out into cheers. 

                          JAEGER

                Yeah!  Yeah! 

                          WES

                I think I'm going to throw up.  I am.

                I'm going to toss. 

                          JAEGER 

                You see that?  Right by us.  They went 

                right by.  You had them Epps; you called

                it. 

                          EPPS 

                Figure they don't want to mess with us 

                anymore than we want to mess with them. 

                          JAEGER 

                Look at you, not even breaking a sweat.

                You're cool, boy.  You're cool. 

     They all have a good laugh, but Wes brings that to a crashing

     halt.  Looking back at the Iraqis, in a voice dead with fear: 

                          WES

                They stopped. 

                          EPPS

                Wha... 

                          WES 

                Oh, Jesus, they've stopped. 

     Epps and Jaeger look behind them.

                          WES(CONT) 

                They stopped, and they've turned around. 

     The two Iraqi vehicles have stopped, they've turned, and now

     they're racing towards our boys.  Epps momentarily freezes.

     Jaeger helps him right out of it. 

                          JAEGER 

                Go, go, go! 

     Epps punches it, and the Hummer takes off.  The Iraqis are

     right behind them. 

     The vehicles all do same hard driving:  They twist and turn

     like wild snakes over the loose sand; hit dunes, take 

     flight... It's the open desert, and our boys have nowhere to

     hide. 

     Inside the Hummer it's a rough, rough ride.  Our boys are

     thrown violently about the cabin.  For Epps controlling the

     Hummer is about as easy as riding a wild horse. 

     The Iraqis turn things up a notch and start sending gunfire

     our way.  Bullets kick up around the Hummer like angry, 

     little bees with a hell of a sting.  Epps yells at Jaeger. 

                          EPPS

                Shoot them! 

     Now it's Jaeger who's freezes.  Epps returns the favor.

                          EPPS(CONT)

                Shoot 'em! 

     Jaeger climbs back to the Humvee's machine gun, works the

     action and starts firing.  Unlike before when he was playing,

     the real thing is much wilder.  The Humvee bounces around 

     like a cork in the ocean.  Taking aim is nearly impossible.

     The best Jaeger can do is squeeze off rounds in the Iraqis'

     general direction. 

     All Wes can do is cover his head, and stay down like a scared

     little girl. 

                          JAEGER

                Steady it out! 

                          EPPS 

                I steady it out, they blow us out of the

                sand! 

     It's like a dog fight in the dirt.  The vehicles weave,

     cut... One of the Iraqis starts to cut across Jaeger's firing

     line.  Jaeger swings the machine gun around hard and lets

     loose.  A hail of bullets rips into the Iraqi vehicle just

     above wheel level.  It kicks the vehicle up and back, 

     whipping and twisting it horribly in the air time after time,

     then smashing it back into the ground. 

     Jaeger is beside himself.

                          JAEGER 

                I got him!  You see that, I nailed him! 

     As if in answer the remaining Iraqi vehicle's gunner tears

     off a salvo that eats up the space right around Jaeger.  He's

     not hit, but it kicks him back down into the Humvee screaming

     with fear. 

                          EPPS

                Damn it!

     The boys are running out of options, and Epps knows it. 

                          EPPS(CONT)

                Wes, take the wheel. 

     No good. Wes is too scared to move.  Epps reaches back and

     literally pulls him up and over into the front. 

                          EPPS(CONT)

                Take it! 

     With little finesse Wes takes the wheel as Epps slides over.

     Epps takes up an M-16 with a grenade launcher.  He loads it

     up, and readies the weapon.  Crawling to the back he takes

     aim. 

                          EPPS(CONT)

                Keep it steady. 

     Wes does his best to give a level ride, but the Iraqi bullets

     coming at them don't help much. 

     Epps zeroes in on the target.  He takes aim and starts to

     squeeze back on the trigger.  He almost has a shot off when

     Wes hits a dune rocking the Hummer violently.  Epps loses the

     target. 

                          EPPS(CONT)

                Damn it!  I said keep it steady. 

     Epps tries to take aim again.  Careful aim.  One shot is all

     he gets.  The bullets keep coming, but he's in no hurry.

     Waiting...waiting...  The Iraqis are only getting closer. 

                          WES

                Shoot...shoot! 

     Waiting...

     Closer... 

                          WES

                SHOOT! 

     EPPS FIRES!  The grenade rips from the launcher, riding a 

     trail of white smoke, and slams into the Iraqis.  You know 

     the story:  Huge explosion, car parts flying a hundred feet

     into the air, bodies whipping through space, stuff Bob Dole

     would hate.  But maybe he would like it.  They were just

     Iraqis.

     Wes brings the Hummer to a halt.  A spastic, scared, relieved 

     laugh escapes him.  Jaeger, checking himself for wounds, and

     Epps, M-16 still in hand, get out.  Epps makes his way to the

     wreckage, sweeping it with his rifle ready to blast any

     survivors.  Yeah, like somebody's walking away from that

     bang. 

     Wes finally makes his way over to the others who stand and

     stare at the burning hulk of whatever it was.

                          WES

                I thought we were dead. 

                          JAEGER 

                Yeah, well, we're not. 

                          WES 

                We got to get out of here. 

     Nobody says anything.  This really scares Wes.

                          WES(CONT)

                We have to go back. 

                          JAEGER 

                We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we

                get what we came for. 

                          WES 

                     (Incredulous) 

                We just about got killed.  You know what

                happened?  We just about got killed, and 

                you want to go on? 

                          EPPS 

                Jaeger, go check out the Hummer for

                damage.

     Jaeger starts to cross back to the Hummer.  Wes gives him

     something to take with him. 

                          WES 

                You're crazy, you know that?  You're

                insane! 

     Jaeger goes leaving Epps and Wes all by their lonesome.  Wes

     turns to Epps.

                          WES(CONT) 

                You know that, right?  You know he's

                sick? 

     With a flip of his head Epps indicates the dead Iraqis.

                          EPPS 

                They shouldn't have been here.

                          WES 

                We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There

                is a war going on! 

                          EPPS 

                This is miles from the battle lines.

                They were probably deserters. 

                          WES 

                Deserters would have run, they wouldn't

                have engaged. 

                          EPPS 

                They shouldn't have been out this way,

                that's all I'm saying. 

     Wes starts to get it.  It really doesn't matter what he has

     to say. 

                          WES 

                We're not going back, are we? 

     Epps has got nothing to say to the truth.  He turns and

     starts to walk to the Hummer.

                          WES(CONT) 

                You bastard!  You're trying to get us

                killed. 

     Like a whip Epps snaps around.  He grabs up Wes and pulls him

     close. 

                          EPPS 

                I'm trying to get us paid.  I'm trying to

                get us all paid!  As long as there's a 

                chance something is out there we go on.

                There's not going to be anymore trouble.

                If there is, we go back, but there won't

                be. 

     Almost as an afterthought Epps realizes he's got Wes, and

     lets him go.  Gently he puts it: 

                          EPPS(CONT) 

                You'll feel different after we find the

                treasure.  Money has away of making

                people feel different. 

     Nobody's got anytbing to say to that, so they say nothing.

     Epps heads back to the Hummer.  A beat later Wes follows.

     Jaeger is already behind the wheel.  Epps rides shotgun this

     time.  Once again Wes is in back.  To Jaeger, Epps ask: 

                          EPPS

                She okay? 

                          JAEGER 

                Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine. 

                          EPPS

                Let's go.

     Jaeger fires it up, and pulls out.  As they head off we: 

                                                           FADE TO:

     BLACK

                                                           FADE TO:

     I/E. HUMVEE - LATER 

     The sun beats down violently as the Hummer rolls along.

     Epps, Jaeger and Wes all ride along in an angry silence.

     Jaeger starts to smile.  He chuckles to himself.  Epps, 

     looking for anything to break the tension smiles a bit 

     himself. 

                          EPPS

                What? 

                          JAEGER 

                I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest

                of the boys knew what we're doing.  I

                mean if they knew what we were coming

                back with. 

                          EPPS 

                You can't tell anybody about this. 

                          JAEGER 

                I know.  I know.  But I'm saying, if they

                knew.  We're going to be millionaires,

                man.  Millionaires! 

     Epps joins in cackling like a Hyena. 

                          EPPS 

                It'd make their heads explode.

                          JAEGER 

                Millionaires, man. 

     He turns back to Wes.

                          JAEGER(CONT} 

                You know we're going to be rich.  Admit

                it.  You know.  Come on, admit it. 

     In spite of himself Wes gives a little smile.

                          JAEGER(CONT) 

                Ahh, there it is.  There it is.  You know

                it. 

     Singing to Levert: 

                          EPPS 

                Money, money, money, money...MONEY. 

     Jaeger joins in. 

                          EPPS/JAEGER 

                Money, money, money, money...MONEY. 

     Epps starts to slow down. 

                          WES 

                What are you doing.

                          EPPS 

                Low on gas.  Got to refill. 

     A nervous look punches it way onto Jaeger's face.  Epps

     stops.  He and Wes jump out of the Hummer and go around back 

     to the reserve tanks.

     Jaeger stays in the vehicle looking all tense.  After a beat

     Epps screams for him. 

                          EPPS(O.C.)

                Jaeger...JAEGER! 

     Time to face the music.  Jaeger hauls himself out of the 

     Hummer and goes around to Epps who's got a look on his face

     like he's just had a spoonful of steaming shit.  He points

     angrily at one of the reserve tanks. 

                          EPPS 

                Look at it.  LOOK AT IT!  Shot to hell.

                It's been leaking gas since the fire 

                fight.  I told you to check for damage. 

                          JAEGER

                ...I know. 

                          EPPS 

                And you missed this?  How are you going

                to miss something like this? 

                          JAEGER 

                I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew 

                one of the reserves got hit you'd want to

                turn back. 

                          WES 

                So, you just let us drive on knowing we 

                were losing fuel?  Knowing we were going

                to run low in the middle of nowhere? 

                          JAEGER 

                ...I figured...I figured you'd turn back. 

     Wes gets a slow boil on. 

                          WES 

                ...You stupid son of a bitch. 

     Wes lunges for Jaeger, but doesn't have the speed or the

     skills.  Jaeger counters, and sinks a fist into Wes' jaw. 

     Wes goes down, but he manages to take Jaeger to the sand with

     him.  They start to scrape, but it's obvious Jaeger has got

     the upper hand.

     Epps reaches down and yanks Jaeger off of Wes.

                          EPPS

                Get off him. 

     Jaeger comes up to his feet.  Wes wipes some blood from his 

     lips.  He looks down at his bloodied hand, then sneers at

     Jaeger. 

                          EPPS(CONT) 

                You two fighting's not going to get us 

                anything.

                          WES 

                Him getting us stranded out here doesn't

                do much good either.

                          JAEGER 

                We're not stranded.  We've got enough gas

                in the other reserve to get us back.

                          WES 

                Then lets go back while we still can.

                          JAEGER 

                As soon as we hit the mountain we would 

                have had to go on foot anyway.  We're not

                that far.  We can make it. 

                          EPPS 

                What do we do with the Humvee?

                          JAEGER

                We leave it. 

                          WES 

                What if someone takes it? 

     Jaeger throws his arms wide to the empty desert.

                          JAEGER

                Who?  Who's going to take it.  We mark

                the location with the navicom, we can

                come right back to this spot. 

     Wes has had enough. 

                          WES 

                You two don't even know how crazy you 

                are.  You want to go on your sick, little

                treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me

                absent. 

                          JAEGER 

                You have to go with us, Wes. 

                          WES 

                Really?  What is that, an order, 

private

? 

                          JAEGER 

                You have to go with us.  You can't walk

                back... 

     Jaeger dangles the keys to the Humvee from a finger.

                          JAEGER{CONT) 

                And you sure as hell aren't going to

                drive. 

     Wes burns a hole through Jaeger's head with his eyes.  Epps

     steps to him.

                          EPPS 

                Load what you can; water, tools, weapons.

                Anything you think we might need. 

     Wes burns on a bit more, then turns and heads for the Hummer.

     Jaeger watches him go, then smiles to himself.

                          JAEGER

                Who's he kidding?  He wants it as bad as

                we do.  We're going to be fat, Epps.  As

                soon as we get back to Saudivillie you

                and me are going to-- 

     Epps gets up in Jaeger's face.  The menace he projects is

     very real. 

                          EPPS 

                We're going to keep going 'cause I want

                some of whatever's out there.  But you 

                ever pull something like trying to get my

                ass stranded out here again, and I'll

                kill you myself.  You got that? 

     Jaeger just stands there, his fear swelling. 

                          EPPS(CONT)

                SAY IT! 

                          JAEGER

                I got that...sir. 

     Epps storms over towards the Hummer leaving Jaeger to be all

     scared with himself. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. DESERT - LATER 

     A long line of footprints works their way through the sand up

     to Epps, Jaeger, and Wes.  Epps and Wes trek side by side.

     Jaeger is behind them, having trouble keeping up.  Between

     pants he gasps:

                          JAEGER 

                Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to

                go so fast. 

                          EPPS 

                Faster we get there, faster we get back. 

                          JAEGER 

                Yeah.  I know.  I'm with you. 

     Jaeger struggles on just a bit more, then:

                          JAEGER(CONT) 

                I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a

                little water. 

                          EPPS 

                Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you

                aren't getting any of ours.

                          JAEGER 

                I'm just going to have a little sip,

                that's all.  Just a sip. 

     Jaeger lets himself drop down into the sand.  He looks up.

     Epps and Wes are still walking. 

                          JAGER{CONT)

                Wait for me! 

                          EPPS

                You can catch up. 

                          JAEGER 

                Yeah...I'm right behind you. 

     Wes looks back at Jaeger sitting on the ground sucking on his

     water. 

                          WES 

                Thanks for straightening out Jaeger.

     Epps shrugs, like hitting Jaeger wasn't much of anything.

                          EPPS 

                Maybe we are crazy for doing this.  But

                if we do it, we do it right.  I just

                needed to explain that in a way I

                wouldn't have to do it again. 

                          WES

                Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an

                idiot. 

                          EPPS

                He's not so-- 

                          WES 

                He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as

                hard as he thinks.

                          EPPS 

                How tough you have to be to make the 

                army?  All you've got to do is shoot a

                gun, and stop a bullet.

     Again Epps looks behind him as Jaeger struggles to his feet

     and stumbles after his two comrades.

                          WES 

                Look at him.  We ought to just leave him

                behind. 

     Epps gives a little laugh like he's just heard a mildly

     amusing punchline.

                          WES(CONT) 

                Like he said:  People get lost in wars

                all the time.  And out here?  Out here

                there are eight million ways to die. 

     All this talk starts to creep out Epps a little. 

                          EPPS 

                Okay, so he was riding you.  Get over it.

     Wes smiles a little smile. 

                          WES

                I'm just talking. 

     They walk on.

     Jaeger works to catch up, muttering to himself as he goes.

                          JAEGER

                Can't even slow up for me.  Wasn't for me

                they wouldn't even be here.  I'm the one

                that found the map.  Should have just 

                come by myself.  Should've.  Shouldn't

                even cut them in.  Shouldn't. 

     As Jaeger steps down be hears an audible clicking sound come 

     from under his boot.  He goes dead still.  Panic races up and

     down his spine.  In almost a whisper be says:

                          JAEGER

                Epps... 

     Again, louder: 

                          JAEGER(CONT)

                Epps! 

     Like he couldn't be more annoyed Epps turns around.

                          EPPS

                What!? 

                          JAEGER

                Mine. 

     Epps isn't sure of what he's heard. 

                          EPPS

                What? 

                          JAEGER

                Mine.  Land mine!

     Epps doesn't say anything, he just keeps on staring.  Scared,

     angry they don't get it: 

                          JAEGER(CONT) 

                I stepped on a land mine!

     Epps and Wes look at each other, then back to Jaeger.  Like

     he's got no time to mess around: 

                          EPPS 

                You didn't step on any mine. 

                          JAEGER

                I heard it click. 

                          EPPS 

                If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by

                now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines

                anymore. 

                          JAEGER

                I heard it.

                          WES 

                Maybe it's just a can, or something. 

     Jaeger loses it. 

                          JAEGER 

                JESUS CHRIST, I'M STANDING ON A MINE.

                SHUT UP, AND GET OVER HERE! 

     Just plain sick of all this, Epps and Wes trudge back over to Jaeger. 

                          EPPS 

                Paranoid, that's your problem.  You're

                just paranoid.  Why'd the paranoid one

                have to find the map? 

     Epps pulls a knife from his belt.  He sinks to the ground and

     probes the sand under Jaeger's foot.  Nothing...nothing... 

     WE HEAR THE SOUND OF METAL AGAINST METAL.  Epps goes white.

     For a second he doesn't move.  Tension falls like a steel

     curtain.  Slow, careful, Epps withdraws the blade and stands.

     Jaeger reads the expression on Epps' face. 

                          JAEGER

                Oh, God!  Oh God! 

                          EPPS

                Just be cool. 

                          JAEGER 

                It's a mine, isn't it? 

                          EPPS

                Just relax. 

                          JAEGER 

                How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!? 

                          EPPS 

                We're going to get off, all right.  We'll

                get you off of there.  Just...be cool. 

     Epps goes to Wes.  The two start to move away from Jaeger. 

                          JAEGER

                Where you going? 

                          EPPS 

                Me and Wes are just going to talk. 

                          JAEGER 

                Why you got to move away to talk!? 

                          EPPS 

                We're going to be right over here. 

                          JAEGER 

                You're moving away because it's going to

                blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow

                up! 

                          EPPS 

                I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool! 

     Epps and Wes move over and huddle.

                          WES 

                What kind of mine? 

                          EPPS 

                I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess

                with it. 

                          WES

                Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse,

                that's Vietnam stuff. 

                          EPPS 

                Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford,

                okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. 

                Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe 

                it's going to go off in two seconds, and

                we won't have to worry about getting 

                Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to

                worry about is finding the pieces. 

     Behind them, pathetically, Jaeger cries: 

                          JAEGER

                Epps... 

                          WES 

                Doesn't matter.  We're not going to be

                able to get him off it anyway. 

                          EPPS

                There's a way. 

                          JAEGER

                Epps...

                          WES 

                Can't do it.  Can't do it, and keep him 

                alive. 

     Epps' eyes narrow.  He doesn't want to hear this kind of

     talk. 

                          EPPS 

                I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.

                          JAEGER 

                Epps, my leg is falling asleep. 

     Epps thinks, and thinks hard.

                          EPPS

                     (To Wes) 

                We've got rope? 

                          WES

                For climbing.

                          EPPS

                Break it out. 

     Epps crosses back over to Jaeger.

                          JAEGER

                My leg is falling asleep. 

                          EPPS

                It's not falling asleep.  You've only

                been standing there for three minutes. 

                          JAEGER 

                I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's

                falling asleep. 

                          EPPS 

                It falls asleep and you die, so wake it

                the hell up. 

     Wes crosses over with climbing rope.  Very, very gently Epps

     wraps the middle of the rope around Jaeger's waist leaving

     several feet dangling off each end. 

                          JAEGER 

                How's this going to work? 

                          EPPS 

                Me and Wes each going take an end of the 

                rope, run our asses of, and yank you off

                the mine. 

                          JAEGER 

                That's going to do it, right?  I'm going

                to be okay.

     Not too convincingly: 

                          EPPS

                You're going to be fine. 

                          JAEGER

                You're not going to let me die, are you!?

                Don't let me die! 

     Ignoring the question:

                          EPPS 

                When we start running suck up your 

                breath.  You're going to get the wind

                knocked out of you. 

                          JAEGER 

                Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to

                die. 

     Epps and Wes pick up separate ends of the rope, and take up 

     positions behind Jaeger.  Epps waits a beat, afraid of what

     might happen, but there is no choice.  He digs in ready to

     take off running.  Wes whispers to him:

                          WES 

                What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to

                bounce right up out of the ground, 

                explode in the air, kill him and us. 

                          EPPS

                You just go when I say go. 

                          WES 

                Should have at least gotten the map off

                of him.  Blows up with him then we did

                all this for nothing. 

     Ignoring him: 

                          EPPS

                Ready? 

                          WES

                Yeah. 

     Epps takes a couple of deep breaths, holds one: 

                          EPPS

                GO! 

     Wes and Epps are off the the races, churning up sand as they

     race away from Jaeger.  They scream like banshees as if to

     draw strength.

     Jaeger does a little chant: 

                          JAEGER 

                Oh, God.  Oh, God! 

     The rope goes taught.  Jaeger's body jerks violently backward

     as he gets the air punched out of him.  As his feet leave the

     ground the mine detonates.

                                                            CUT TO:

     POV - JAEGER 

     A fireball blossoms, and eats up the air towards the camera

     as THE CAMERA ITSELF RUSHES AWAY from the belching fire and

     smoke. 

                                                            CUT TO: 

     JAEGER 

     His feet just clear the outer edge of the fireball, but still

     get licked and burned by flames before he slams to the ground

     several feet from the explosion. 

     Epps runs to Jaeger.  Wes takes a casual stroll back over. 

                          JAEGER 

                I'm all right.  Oh, Jesus, I'm all right. 

     All casual like, Wes says: 

                          WES

                The map okay? 

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. DESERT - LATER

     We see a set of three very odd tracks across the ground.  It

     looks like something has been dragged through the sand.  THE

     CAMERA FOLLOWS THE TRACKS TO EPPS, WES AND JAEGER who crawl

     on their bellies.  They thrust knifes into the sand before 

     them searching for mines.  We get the feeling they've been at

     this for awhile.

                          WES

                How long we going to keep this up. 

                          JAEGER 

                Until we're out of the mine field is how

                long. 

                          WES 

                Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.

                          JAEGER 

                That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could 

                have just spread them out like that; make

                us think we're in the clear. 

                          WES 

                You want to crawl, crawl. 

     Wes stands and starts to walk.  Epps waits a beat and follows

     suit.  Only Jaeger stays down. 

                          JAEGER 

                You're going to blow yourselves up. 

                          EPPS 

                Wes is right.  If there were any more 

                mines we would have found them.  Hell, 

                that one you stepped on was probably old 

                anyway; left over from the war with Iran.

                          JAEGER 

                You don't know that.  It could be a trick. 

                          EPPS 

                If we step on a mine we'll know it was.

                Let me see the maps.

     Jaeger stays down, afraid to get up. 

                          EPPS(CONT) 

                Get up and give me the maps.

     After a beat Jaeger stands and hands over the map from the

     puzzle box and a recon photo.  Epps compares the two, then

     takes out the navicom. 

                          EPPS(CONT)

                We're on course.  Northeast, twenty-eight

                degrees.  When we hit the base of the 

                mountain we'll find a pass.  I can see it

                on the recon photo.  Shouldn't be too 

                hard to traverse.  That'll take us to the

                top and... 

     Epps points at a black dot on the puzzle box map with a

     smaller white dot in the middle. 

                          EPPS 

                This.  Whatever it is. 

                          JAEGER 

                It's the treasure, that's what it is. 

                          WES

                It better be. 

     Epps starts to pack away the map.  Real plain Jaeger says:

                          JAEGER

                The map. 

     Epps stops, like he almost not sure what Jaeger is talking

     about.  Jaeger extends a hand. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)

                The map. 

     Epps gets it.  He hands the map back to Jaeger who tucks it

     away.  Our boys walk on. 

                          EPPS 

                You're not losing trust, are you? 

                          JAEGER

                Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang

                on to it. 

                          WES 

                If all we wanted was the map out of you

                we could have taken it while you were

                standing on that mine pissing on

                yourself. 

                          JAEGER 

                Probably would've too if Epps wasn't

                around to stop you. 

                          EPPS 

                I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause 

                nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in

                this together, understand? 

                          JAEGER 

                Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to

                come along in the first place, but he 

                gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet

                deal. 

                          WES 

                I'm getting tired of you riding me,

                Jaeger. 

                          JAEGER 

                Anytime you want to do something about it

                just let-- 

     Epps stops dead in his tracks.

                          EPPS

                Quiet! 

     They all go quiet. Epps cocks an ear to the air and listens.

     They all listen.  Wind, but that's about it. 

                          JAEGER 

                I don't hear any-- 

                          EPPS 

                Shut up and listen!

     Again they listen.  Again they hear wind.  Then, there it is;

     the sound Epps is looking for:  A pop, like a big balloon

     being burst just over the next rise. 

                          WES

                Gunfire. 

     Quick like that Jaeger grabs his M-16 down off his shoulder

     and is about to ready it when Epps slaps down the muzzle.

                          EPPS

                Don't! 

                          JAEGER 

                It's a fire fight. 

                          EPPS 

                Single shots doesn't mean a fire fight.

                That's not a battle going on. 

                          WES

                What is it? 

     Epps thinks.  Yeah, what the hell is it? 

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. DESERT - RISE 

     Epps, Jaeger, and Wes edge carefully up to the lip of the 

     rise on their bellies.  They're barely visible against the

     sand.  Epps takes out a pair of binoculars and zeros in on

     the ground below. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     POV - EPPS 

     THROUGH BINOCULAR LENSES we see a SHI'ITE CAMP:  A tent city 

     really.  There are several uniformed IRAQI SOLDIERS who are

     roughing up the Shi'ite men.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EPPS, WES, JAEGER 

                          JAEGER 

                What is it? 

     Epps hands the binoculars over to Jaeger.  Who looks down at

     the scene on the ground.

                          EPPS 

                Iraqis.  A bunch of them. 

                          JAEGER 

                What are they doing here? 

     Jaeger hands the binoculars to Wes.

                          EPPS 

                Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm

                guessing that has something to do with

                them being here.

                          JAEGER 

                What are they doing in the middle of

                nowhere? 

                          WES 

                Maybe they're looking for gold. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     POV - WES 

     AGAIN WE SEE THROUGH THE BINOCULAR LENSES.  One of the Iraqi

     soldiers is pushing around a Shi'ite, having a good laugh 

     about it, then casual as rain pulls out a gun and gives him a

     bullet, gift wrapped, straight to the brain. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     EPPS, WES, JAEGER

                          JAEGER 

                Jesus!  What the hell did he do that for?

                They're Iraqis.  Why are Iraqis killing

                Iraqis? 

                          WES 

                Those people down there are Shi'ites.

                You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq

                and Khurds in the North.  Neither of

                them've got much love for Saddam. 

                Probably figured once the war started 

                there might be an uprising, so he sent

                his soldiers out to slap them around some. 

                          EPPS 

                They're doing more than slapping.

                          JAEGER 

                The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't

                know that. 

                          WES 

                Is there anything you do know? 

                          JAEGER 

                I know you're a pussy.  I know that. 

                          EPPS 

                All right.  Let's get out of here. 

                          WES 

                The soldiers are going to kill those

                people! 

                          JAEGER

                So? 

                          WES

                We have to do something. 

                          EPPS

                There's nothing we can do.

                          WES 

                We can fight.  That's what we're here 

                for:  To fight the Iraqis.  To help the

                Shi'ites, and the Khurds. 

                          JAGER 

                I didn't sign up to help any Shi'ites.

                All we were supposed to do is get the 

                Iraqis out of Kuwait, and if we aren't

                doing that then all bets are off. 

                          EPPS 

                We carrying any ordinance? 

                          WES 

                Some extra grenades.  A Claymore. 

     Epps thinks, then shakes his head.

                          EPPS 

                Not enough.  We're out numbered and out

                gunned.  They'd cut us to shreds.

                          JAEGER 

                So good bye, Shi'ites.  Thanks for 

                playing.  We have some lovely parting

                gifts for you as you go. 

                          WES 

                We're American soldiers.  We don't

                abandon people. 

                          JAEGER 

                Funny you should say that while we're out

                looking for gold. 

                          WES 

                You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so

                bad. 

                          JAEGER 

                I've got a new agenda now, it's get rich.

                The only way the Iraqis figure into that

                is not at all. 

                          EPPS

                     (To Wes) 

                I don't want to see people killed any 

                more than you.  But we try to help out we

                die, and all we do is die. 

                          WES 

                We can't just go off and-- 

                          EPPS 

                There's nothing we can do.  We shouldn't

                even be here in the first place. 

     There's a big, loud quiet as our boys just hang there.  From

     down below comes another balloon burst; another gun shot.

     Epps lowers his head.  He wants to fight, but it's like he 

     said:  There's nothing they can do.  Epps slides back away 

     from the rise, then Jaeger, and finally Wes disappears back

     the way they came.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. DESERT/MOUNTAINS - LATER 

     It's the kind of red rock and mesas one would expect to find 

     in a desert; not too steep or rough, but it looks as though

     they will definitely takes more than a little physical

     exertion to navigate. 

     Epps, Wes, and Jaeger approach a path at the mesa's base.

     Jaeger takes out his maps and looks them over.

                          JAEGER 

                This is it.  We're right on target. 

     Epps takes a long gander up towards the top of the mesa.

                          EPPS 

                All we've got to do is make it to the

                top.

                          WES 

                And find the treasure, and get it, and 

                get back to the Humvee, and get the hell

                out of Iraqi without getting our heads

                blown off, but that's about it. 

                          EPPS 

                We're not going to find anything standing

                here.  Let's get to climbing. 

     They ready their packs and weapons, then start up the mesa.

                                                           FADE TO:

     Our boys trekking along the pass.  They push onward and

     upward.

                                                           FADE TO:

     The pass has narrowed, and become more treacherous:  The

     rocks are loose and the footing unsure.  The going has slowed

     considerably as each man must be extremely careful of their

     steps.

                                                           FADE TO: 

     Our boys stop.  The pass has seemingly came to an end.  For a

     short ways the face of the mesa is almost sheer.  The three

     soldiers take it in. 

                          EPPS 

                Not much of a pass.

                          WES 

                Probably was a couple of hundred years

                ago when whoever drew the map came 

                through here.  Worn down to nothing now.

                          EPPS 

                Picks up again just on the other side. 

     They all take a good look at what little there is to cross 

     on, and how far down it is to the hard, jagged rocks below. 

                          JAEGER 

                Think we can make it? 

                          WES 

                We make it, or we go back empty handed.

                          EPPS 

                Looks like we make it. 

     Epps and Wes edge their way towards what's left of the pass.

     Jaeger just stands there staring down.  Way down.

                                                           FADE TO: 

     Epps, Wes and Jaeger inch along the pass hugging the face of

     the mesa.  Small rocks churn beneath their feet and tumble to

     the ground below.  No man says a word, they're too busy 

     trying to keep alive, and the air is filled with the sounds

     of labored breathing.

     Each step so very careful:  Testing the pass for purchase,

     making sure the footing is solid.  They inch one foot

     forward, then slide over the next.  Their hands probe the

     cliff face, fingers crawling like spider legs, looking for

     something, anything, to take hold of. 

     Sweat drips into Epps eye.  He blinks hard and fast trying to

     clear his vision.  Right now he can't really afford

     distractions. 

     Slowly, carefully, inch by inch the little death dance goes

     on. 

     Jaeger steps.  He steps wrong.  The pass gives way under his 

     foot and begins to slide down.  Instinctively Wes rockets out

     an arm grabbing Jaeger by the uniform.  At first Jaeger 

     smiles, glad for the save.  But then he realizes something: 

     Wes is literally holding his life in his hands.  All Wes has

     to do is loosen his grip, and...

     The color drains from Jaeger's face.  Wes stares back blank

     as a bowl of water. 

     Eternity goes on for a second. 

     Finally Wes yanks Jaeger back up against the mesa's face,

     then slides on.  Jaeger just hangs where he is for a beat

     clutching the rocks for dear life.

                                                           FADE TO:

     Epps makes it to the far side of the broken pass.  He holds

     out a hand to Wes and reels him in.  Together they both help

     bring in Jaeger.  Wes looks back over the path they've just

     crossed. 

                          WES 

                The US Army:  Always an adventure.

                          EPPS 

                Let me see the map.

     Jaeger hands the map to Epps who gives it a going over.  THEY

     WALK AS THEY TALK.

                          EPPS(CONT) 

                Should be easy going from here.  Stay on

                the pass straight to the dot. 

                          WES 

                What do you figure it to be? 

                          EPPS 

                Got to be some kind of landmark;

                something distinctive.

                          JAEGER

                X marks the spot.

                          EPPS 

                Something like that.

                          JAEGER 

                But the white dot in the middle; that's

                got to mean something.

                          EPPS 

                I hope it means something, otherwise...

                          WES 

                Otherwise whatever we're looking for

                could be anywhere.

                          EPPS 

                Basically.  But the map has been pretty

                precise so far.  I don't think it'll be

                too hard to-- 

     Our boys step past a grouping of rocks.  They stop dead.

     Sitting before them, in what looks like a small camp, is FIVE

     IRAQI SOLDIERS.  Time clicks by real slow for an instant.

     It's a delayed reaction, like the beat it takes after you

     pick up a hot pan before you realize that, yeah, it is

     burning the flesh from your hand. 

                          EPPS(CONT)

                Take cover! 

     Our three soldiers turn and bolt back the way they came.

     They run like wild rabbits for a bit, jumping over a rock

     formation and hitting the deck using the rocks as cover. 

     Like well-trained warriors they peel their weapons from their

     shoulders, lock and load, and stand ready.  They wait a bit,

     taking several deep breaths like divers about to go under.

     Finally Epps gives the order. 

                          EPPS(CONT)

                Let's hit 'em! 

     Simultaneously they spring up from behind the rocks and bear

     down on the Iraqis with their M-16s ready to blow them to

     kingdom come. 

     One problem:  No Iraqis.

     For a beat our three don't move.  They hold position, breath

     coming hard like sprinters at the end of a race.  They're 

     eyes flint back and forth scanning for something...anything.

     There's nothing. 

                          EPPS(CONT)

                Cover me. 

     M-16 still at the ready, Epps raises up taking a tactical

     stance.  He inches forward, sweeping his weapon back and 

     forth before him for any potential target.  There is none.

     The Iraqis have vanished.  Epps lowers the M-16, but does not

     shoulder it. 

                          EPPS(CONT)

                Clear. 

     Wes and Jaeger come up from their cover and cross to Epps.

     They keep their weapons ready.  Eerily they all look around

     as if trying to spot ghosts.

                          WES 

                Where'd they go? 

                          EPPS 

                I don't know.  There's a lot of space up

                here.  They could be just about-- 

                          WES 

                Weird they didn't chase us.

                          JAEGER 

                Maybe they're as scared of us as we are

                of them. 

                          WES 

                Just seems weird they didn't chase us.

                          EPPS 

                What's weird is how they disappeared. 

                Doesn't make sense.  Doesn't...

     There is a sound; a steady swooshing that starts faint and 

     grows closer like a rolling thunder.  Our three start looking

     around, turning where they stand, trying to find the source

     of the sound as it rises to a near deafening pitch.  There's

     nothing.  They see nothing.  Still the sound races closer and

     closer.  Epps, Jaeger and Wes raise up their weapons in

     preparation to defend themselves against this unseen beast.

     From below the edge of the mesa a HELICOPTER GUNSHIP -

     probably a MIL MI-24 HIND-D ARMED ASSAULT HELICOPTER if you

     want to be technical - raises up very dramatically into

     sight.  It hangs in the air ominously before our soldiers.

     On board are the vanished Iraqis wearing nasty grins.  The

     PILOT brings the gunship about and levels her massive machine

     cannons at our boys.

                          EPPS(CONT)

                Scatter! 

     Wes and Jaeger don't have to be told twice.  They bolt from

     their spots, and not an instant too soon.  The GUNNER lets

     fly a barrage of shells that literally tear up the ground

     where our boys were just standing.  We see what the chopter's 

     weapons will do to rock.  We can imagine what they would do

     to flesh. 

     Epps, Jaeger and Wes take cover behind some rocks.  The 

     gunship swings around, picks up speed and bears down on them. 

     More shells fired.  They punch into and through the rocks our

     boys use for cover.  Again the three scatter, and just in

     time as the shells rip their way through the rock.

     Our three go sliding down an embankment, crouching low.

     Their heads whip around looking for the gunship.

                          JAEGER 

                Where is it?  Where'd it go? 

                          EPPS

                Stay low. 

                          JAEGER 

                Where the hell is it!? 

                          EPPS

                Just stay down. 

     In answer to Jaeger's question the gunship comes swooping up

     behind them like a bird of prey.  Our three have all of about

     a second to get running before the Iraqis send more shells

     their way.  They kick up chunks of rock as they ping, ping, 

     ping around Epps, Wes and Jaeger who make a wild, evasive

     run.

     Dig it:  Up ahead is a narrow passage through rock face.

     They race for it, hurl themselves into it as the gunship

     sends a special delivery of white-hot metal their way. 

     Once inside the passage they have a bit of breathing space.

     It's too narrow for the gunship to get a good shot through. 

     Our three press themselves up against the rock walls and suck

     air.

     Beyond the opening to the passage the gunship swings back and

     forth like a junkyard dog patrolling its kingdom. 

     Jaeger's worked up a real scare. 

                          JAEGER 

                What are we going to do?  What the hell

                are we going to do? 

                          EPPS 

                We're not going to do anything.

                          JAEGER

                     (Panicked) 

                They're going to kill us!

                          EPPS

                They can't shoot us in here.

                          WES 

                And they can't fly around out there

                forever.

                          EPPS

                So we wait. 

                          JAEGER

                If they land-- 

                          EPPS 

                If they land, we can take them.  If they

                don't land, then we've got nothing to

                worry about. 

     Wes watches the gunship as it seemingly settles in the air.

     It floats very steady as if...  Wes' eyes key in on 

     something:  The gunship's missile pods rotating slightly, 

     coming in line... Wes' eyes go wide like someone just jammed

     an electric cattle prod in his ass. 

                          WES

                Missile! 

                          EPPS

                Move! 

     Epps, Wes and Jaeger sprint for the opening at the far end of

     the passage as a missile rockets from the gunship's pod.

     With a wild whine it rides the wind like a deadly arrow

     straight into the passage.  Slamming into the ground it

     sprouts a terrific fireball that rides on a massive 

     explosion.  It races through the passage, lifts our boys from

     the ground and tosses them out into the open like they were

     nothing more than discarded ragdolls.

     Jaeger takes cover and cowers.  He puts his panic into

     overdrive. 

     Wes pulls his rifle.  Grunting like an animal he sprays 

     bullets at the chopter, but it's like throwing snowballs at

     an elephant.  The gunship turns on Wes and fires in his 

     direction.  It doesn't hit him, but it sends him running.

     Epps has had enough of this shit.  He scrambles to load a 

     grenade in his launcher as the gunship comes about.  It races 

     for him, cannons at the ready.  This one is going to be 

     close.  Epps locks and loads just as the chopter swings down 

     on him.  Epps fires, but the gunship simply jukes up and away

     from the grenade the way someone might step over a bug.  The

     grenade impacts the rock face behind the chopter exploding

     harmlessly.  The chopter returns the favor by reining down a

     hail of shells that kicks Epps back FLIPPING HIM UP AND OVER

     the edge of the plateau.  His M-16 goes flying, smashing into

     the ground far below.  Epps manages to grab hold of the 

     plateau lip with one hand.  It swings him around, slamming 

     him hard against the cliff face.  He hangs there, suspended by

     his weakening grip, far above the ground.

                          JAEGER

                Epps! 

     Jaeger and Wes run to him, grabbing him by his arm.  They

     pull and pull hard until Epps can get some kind of purchase,

     and crawl his way back up to the plateau.

     At the same time the gunship lowers itself so that it hovers

     above and beyond our three.  It rotates so that the bay doors

     are facing Epps, Wes and Jaeger.  Three Iraqis are inside,

     weapons trained on our targets.  One of them yells something.

     Wes translates.

                          WES 

                They want us to surrender.

     The three share a nervous look.  Epps fairly growls:

                          EPPS 

                Yeah, I'll surrender. 

     Jaeger and Wes watch as, shielded by their bodies, Epps palms

     a grenade from his belt.  Wes and Jaeger don't quite smile,

     but they know now they at least have a chance.  As Epps

     stands the other two turn to face the Iraqis.  They all fold

     their hands behind their necks which, for Epps, hides the

     grenade from view.  Slowly they walk towards the gunship.

     One of the Iraqis starts to yell something.  He lifts his

     weapon and aims it at our boys.  With his thumb Epps yanks 

     the pin from the grenade and lets fly.  It's a perfect toss,

     landing in the chopter's bay.  The Iraqis see the grenade 

     land, they scramble for it.  One of them grabs it up and is

     about to throw it back out of the gunship. 

     Too late. 

     The grenade explodes in the Iraqi's hand killing him

     instantly.  It also touches off a fire ball that severely 

     damages the gunship.  It rocks, lists, spins wildly out of

     control. 

                          EPPS(CONT)

                Get down!

     Our three hug the ground as the chopter's rotors go whipping

     through the air like throwing knifes landing perilously among

     them.  Worse still the gunship, now a lame bird, drops from

     the sky towards Epps, Jaeger and Wes.  All they can do is 

     cover their heads, as if that would do any good against two

     tons of crashing steel.  The chopter rushes down...down, but

     it just misses them.  It slams into the ground skipping over

     the edge of the plateau, to the rocks below. 

     Our three pick themselves up.  They walk to the edge of the

     plateau and look down on the crash. 

     Jaeger, scared painted all over his face, sinks to his knees

     and looks as if he's about to go into shock.

                          JAEGER

                Oh, God... 

     Wes looks down at Jaeger with a bit of a disdainful sneer. 

                          WES 

                Yeah.  Just keeps getting better and

     EXT. DESERT/MESA - LATER 

     Epps, Wes and Jaeger trek to a large crevice that runs 

     straight down into the ground.  Jaeger takes out his maps and

     photos.  Epps consults the navicom.

                          WES 

                What do you think? 

                          JAEGER 

                Lines up with the map and the photos.

                          EPPS 

                We're right where we should be. 

     Epps tucks the navicom away on his belt and takes a look

     around.  Not much to see.

                          EPPS(CONT) 

                I sure don't see much place else around

                here to hide anything.

     Wes pulls a lantern/flashlight from his pack.  Going to his

     belly he shines it down into the crevice.

                          WES 

                Can't see anything.

     He tosses a rock into it.  We can hear it hit the ground below.

                          WES(CONT)

                It's got a bottom. 

                          JAEGER 

                Guess we know what the next stop is. 

                          EPPS 

                All right.  Let's break out some utility 

                shovels, lanterns, and a claymore in case

                we have to do any blasting.  Me and 

                Jaeger'll climb down, and see what we can

                see. 

                          WES 

                What am I supposed to do? 

                          EPPS 

                Got to have someone here in case we need

                help making it back up.  Doesn't hurt to

                have a look out either. 

                          JAEGER 

                Think there might be more Iraqis? 

                          EPPS 

                Right now I wouldn't be surprised if 

                Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The

     WE SEE A FEW QUICK SHOTS of Wes securing a line down into the

     crevice, Epps and Jaeger clipping on rapeling harnesses, the

     two men lowering themselves down into the great unknown.

     INT. CREVICES - CONTINUOUS 

     The lantern punches a hole through the darkness as Epps uses

     it like a machete to blaze a trial.  He sinks down...down 

     until finally they touch bottom.  He unclips himself from the

     rope and Jaeger starts down.

     The space isn't that big, like a small cave really.  It's 

     tight enough that the lantern pretty well lights up the whole

     of it.  But it's big enough that one wouldn't have any idea

     where to start digging. 

     Jaeger makes it to the bottom.  Wes yells down. 

                          WES

                You down? 

                          JAEGER

                Yeah, we're down. 

                          WES 

                What do you see?

                Nothing. 

     More to himself:

                A whole lot of nothing. 

                          JAEGER 

                So where do we start? 

     Epps takes a look around, then shrugs.

                          EPPS 

                Wherever you want. 

     Epps breaks out his utility shovel from his pack.  Jaeger

     follows suit.  He looks around, picks a spot and starts

     digging.

     Their shirts are off, and they're caked with sweat and dirt. 

     They look like they've been digging for quite some time. 

     They certainly don't have the same enthusiasm they displayed

     previously.  Now they just seem to dig by rote.

     The sun has begun to sink noticeably.  Wes leans over the 

     crevice. 

                          WES 

                Hey...Hey!  Sun's going down.  Epps!

                Jaeger!  It's getting dark up here.

     It's obvious these guys have been digging for hours and come 

     up with nothing.  Epps keeps digging, but just barely. 

     Jaeger doesn't even bother anymore.  He just sits on the

     ground sulking.

                          WES(O.C.)

                I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything,

                because there's nothing down here. 

                          EPPS

                Get up and dig.

                          JAEGER 

                We've been digging.  We've been digging

                for hours.  If there was anything here to

                find we would have found it. 

                          EPPS 

                Get up off your ass and dig! 

     Sounding defeated as all hell, and very whiney:

                          JAEGER 

                What's the point?  There's nothing here.

                The map's a fake.  Christ, even I see 

                that now.  We're just wasting our time.

                We might as well give up and-- 

     Epps spins.  Like a bolt of lightning he's on Jaeger,

     grabbing him up and pulling him close. 

                          EPPS 

                You listen to me.  The whole reason we're

                here is because of you and that map of 

                yours.  I didn't do all this for nothing,

                and I'm not leaving with nothing.  If you

                think for a second I'm giving up just 

                'cause you're too tired to turn over some

                dirt, then you don't know John Epps too 

                well, do you?  So you dig, and you keep

                on digging 'til I say you don't have to

                dig anymore.

     Epps pushes Jaeger back and he goes down to the ground hard.

     A fire burns inside him.  A fire that burns out of control.

     Before he even knows what he's doing Jaeger springs to his

     feet, shovel in hand, bringing it down in a long arc for

     Epps' head.

     Epps bears him coming.  He deftly side steps the blow, grabs

     hold of Jaeger and forces him down.  They roll around

     violently like wild dogs trading blows and trying to work the

     other into a choke hold.

     He can hear the sounds of the struggle and yells down.

                          WES

                What are you doing...?  What the hell are

                you doing down there?

     EPPS AND JAEGER 

     They fight on; down and dirty.  Locked together they roll

     around the ground, each trying to get the upper hand.  They

     smash into the lantern, sending the cave into near darkness.

     At the same time Epps works himself on top of Jaeger.  He

     lands a couple of solid punches, takes a rock from the ground 

     and lifts it high ready to send it crashing into Jaeger's

     skull.  All Jaeger can do is steel himself for the deathblow. 

     Something catches Epps' eye:  A glint of light flashes across

     his faces.  He stares at it; at an opening, a bare seem

     really, in the side of the cave wall where light seeps 

     through.  The rock slips from his hand.  Forgetting all about

     Jaeger Epps goes to the opening.  Jaeger himself, as if what

     just happened hadn't really happened, comes up along side

     Epps.

                          JAEGER 

                Must be a compartment. 

                          EPPS 

                I feel air.  Probably opens up outside 

                somewhere.  That's where the light comes 

                from.  Couldn't see it with the lanternon. 

     Jaeger says what they both must have guessed by now. 

                          JAEGER 

                The white dot; light in the dark. 

     That's all Epps needs to hear.  He starts clawing at the

     opening with his bare hands.  That gets him nothing. 

     Grabbing up a shovel he starts to whack at it.  Jaeger gets 

     the lantern working again, then picks up his shovel and joins

     in.  They keep hitting and hitting, picking up a rhythm like

     a southern chain gang. 

                          JAEGER (CONT)

                Maybe we should blast it loose with the

                claymore. 

                          EPPS

                It's giving. 

     The rock gives way enough for Epps to pry it free.  There's

     just enough space for a man to reach his arm through.  For a

     beat Epps and Jaeger just stare at the opening almost afraid

     of what mayor may not be in there.

     With some trepidation Epps begins to move his hand towards 

     the opening.  Slowly it extends closer...closer...  Just as

     it moves beyond the opening. vThere is a wild, screeching 

     hiss as some small, hairy thing leaps for Epps.

     Both Epps and Jaeger recoil, Jaeger going nuts with fear. 

                          JAEGER

                Jesus Christ! 

     Jaeger grabs up his M-16 and takes aim at...whatever it is.

                          EPPS 

                No, don't shoot! 

     Too late. Jaeger squeezes off a few rounds.  A couple of

     bullets hit the thing, but the rest ricochet wildly about the

     cave and around Epps and Jaeger.  All the two men can do is

     duck and cover - squeezing themselves into tight, fetal balls

     - as the bullets scream back and forth like little chunks of

     random death. 

     Eventually the bullets lose speed and die off.  Jaeger and

     Epps raise up off the ground.  They walk to the dead thing

     that jumped from the opening.

                          EPPS 

                It's just a mongoose.

     They go back to the opening.  Epps shines a light inside to

     make sure there are no more surprises, then reaches an arm

     in.  Jaeger looks on with great anticipation, licking his

     lips like a hungry jackal, as Epps twists his arm in the

     opening.  Searching...searching... 

     Epps' face freezes.  He goes perfectly still for a beat, then

     slowly draws his hand from the opening.  It clutches a wooden

     box.  It is similar to Jaeger's puzzle box, but slightly

     bigger.  The instant Epps sets the box on the ground Jaeger

     smashes his shovel into it shattering the ancient wood.  From

     the splinters pours a river of gold coins.  Jaeger and Epps

     are too stunned to do anything but look at it.

                          EPPS(CONT)

                What? 

                          JAEGER 

                We send the gold up what's to stop him 

                from taking off and leaving us down here? 

                          EPPS 

                He's not going to leave us. 

                          JAEGER 

                What's to stop him if he wanted to?  All

                he has to do is cut the line...

     Good point.  What is to stop him? 

                          WES

                You ready? 

                          EPPS

                     (To Jaeger) 

                All right.  I'll go up, then you send up

                the gold and-- 

                          JAEGER 

                Why do I have to stay down here? 

                          EPPS

                Jesus, Jaeger. 

                          JAEGER 

                I don't see how that plan's any better.

                          EPPS 

                Someone's got to send the gold up.  It

                can't get on the line by itself. 

                          JAGER 

                Why's it got to be me? 

     A tense moment passes.

                          WES

                What are you doing?  You ready? 

     Another moment, then:

                          EPPS 

                All right.  You go up, I'll send up the

                gold, then follow. 

                          JAEGER 

                Yeah.  Yeah, that'll work. 

     Jaeger goes over to the line and hooks himself on.  He's just

     about ready to climb up when Epps stops him.  Serious as a

     heart attack he says:

                          EPPS 

                If you're even thinking about leaving me

                down here, you better think again. 

     Jaeger stares at Epps for a beat, then laughs himself a

     little laugh.  He yells up:

                          JAEGER 

                Wes, I'm coming up.

     Jaeger starts to climb as Wes helps out by pulling on the 

     rope. 

     Epps watches him for a bit, then looks at the pack of gold

     and the rest of the equipment.  Suddenly he scurries about

     gathering up all the things they've brought down.

     Jaeger continues his climb, disappearing up into the crevice.

     A few beats later the rope comes snaking back down from, 

     above.  Epps brings over the pack of gold and attaches it to

     the rope.  Yelling up:

                          EPPS

                Okay! 

     The rope goes taught, slowly drawing the pack up, up into the

     crevice finally to be swallowed from view. 

     Epps waits for the rope to come back down.  He waits.  He

     waits a beat more.  No rope. 

                          EPPS(CONT)

                Wes?  Jaeger? 

     He tries to keep the apprehension from his voice, but it

     creeps in anyway.  He tries it again.

                          EPPS(CONT)

                Jaeger? 

     Still more nothing.  What's that sound?  It's Epps' breath

     getting heavier and faster. 

                          EPPS(CONT)

                Jaeger!? 

     Nothing.  Then something.  The rope snakes its way back down.

     Epps can't help but let go of a little laugh, like a guy

     who's just been given a scare by his own shadow.  Taking up 

     his own pack Epps hooks up, then starts the climb to the top.

                                                            CUT TO:

     JAEGER AND WES 

     They work the rope, helping Epps up.  He gets to the lip of

     the crevice, and pulls himself over.  He's breathing hard,

     and lets his pack slide to the ground.  Trying not to sound

     too rattled.

                          EPPS 

                What the hell took so long.

                          JAEGER 

                Just had to get the pack unhooked from

                the line.  It didn't seem that long.

                          EPPS 

                Not when you're up here with the gold, I

                guess not. 

     Throwing Epps' own words back at him: 

                          WES 

                Not losing trust, are you? 

     Epps lets this go.

                          EPPS 

                It'll be too dark to make our way back

                now.  Let's bed down for the night and

                head out at first light. 

                          WES 

                What about the gold? 

                          EPPS

                What about it? 

                          WES 

                Maybe we should split it up now. 

                          EPPS 

                We started this together, and we're 

                staying together, so there's no point in

                splitting things up now. 

                          WES 

                What if we get separated?  Way I see it

                if something happens I want to be

                carrying my share.

                          JAEGER 

                Wes might be right about that. 

                          EPPS 

                It stays as it is.  We're halfway home

                now.  Let's not blow it by people getting 

                ideas. 

                          WES 

                You're the one with all the ideas.

                          EPPS 

                You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.

                          WES 

                Maybe you've got ideas of your own for

                the gold.  Maybe you've already got

                things worked out.

                          EPPS

                Maybe I do.

                          WES 

                Maybe I don't need your ideas.  Maybe I

                can do better on my own. 

     Epps sees trouble coming, and deals with it the only way he

     knows how.  Casually he turns from Wes as if he's about to

     let things go.  Suddenly he spins back around throwing a

     punch to Wes' jaw that sends him to the ground.

     Wes puts a hand to his mouth.  It comes back stained red.

     Wes goes on the boil. 

                          WES(CONT)

                You got no reason to do that!

                          EPPS 

                I told you:  When I straighten someone 

                out they stay straightened.  This is how

                it works:  Nobody touches the gold.

                Except when we're on the move and 

                someone's carrying it, nobody so much as

                opens the pack to get an eyeful of it.

                Agreed? 

     Jaeger wastes no time jumping in. 

                          JAEGER 

                Yeah.  Sure.  That sounds like a plan to

                me. 

     Wes, still on the ground, fumes. 

                          WES 

                You got no reason to hit me.  I'm getting

                tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around. 

                          EPPS

                Then get up and do something about it.

     Wes thinks about it, but that's all he does.  He's not ready

     to cross that line yet. 

                          EPPS(CONT)

                Then just lay there and bleed. 

     Epps takes up his pack and moves off to bed down.  Jaeger

     does the same.  Wes just lays on the ground...and bleeds.

                                                           FADE TO:

     BLACK

                                                           FADE TO:

     EXT. MESA - EARLY MORNING 

     The first light of day barely begins to fight its way through

     the dark.  Our boys sleep in a circle around the pack filled

     with gold.  Surprisingly they seem to sleep pretty well, but

     then the last twenty-four hours has taken a lot out of them.

     There is a slight sound: Rocks crunching underneath a foot.

     Someone stirs, someone moves.  It's hard to tell who it is in 

     this bad light.  They creep towards the pack, inching their

     way closer and closer.  They reach out a hand, just about to

     grab the pack.

     Wes, who obviously wasn't asleep at all, lunges for the 

     person, and takes them down hard.  There's the ugly crunch of

     body against stone as they hit the ground.  M-16 in hand Wes

     straddles the intruder pressing the muzzle of the rifle

     against his head. 

                          WES 

                Stay down.  Stay the hell down, or I will

                rip your stinking head off! 

     Underneath him, an IRAQI SOLDIER - who already looks very

     badly injured; bloody, cut, slightly burned - babbles back in

     high pitched and frightened Arabic.

     This is enough to wake Jaeger and Epps. 

                          JAGER

                What the hell?

                          WES 

                I caught him!  I caught him trying to

                steal the gold. 

                          EPPS

                Get off him. 

                          WES 

                     (Slightly crazed) 

                He snuck in here thinking we were asleep,

                only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit

                our throats if I hadn't stopped him. 

                          EPPS

                Get off him! 

     Epps reaches down and physically pulls Wes from the soldier

     who still rattles on. 

                          EPPS(CONT)

                What happened?

                          WES 

                I told you.  He tried to steal our gold.

                He tried to kill us.

                          JAEGER 

                With what?  He doesn't have a weapon. 

                          WES 

                He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a 

                weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare

                hands. 

     The soldier goes on babbling.  Wes has had just about enough

     of that.  He gives the soldier a kick to the ribs. 

                          WES(CONT)

                Shut up! 

     Epps gives Wes a hard push. 

                          EPPS

                Stop it! 

                          WES 

                I told you; don't push me around. 

     Even now, frightened but more calmly, the soldier goes on.

                          EPPS 

                Tell me what he's saying.

     Wes listens, but with disdain.  He translates:

                          WES 

                Says he's one of the soldiers that was in

                the helicopter. 

                          JAEGER 

                He lived through that? 

     The soldier goes on, and so does Wes.

                          WES 

                Says they were deserters, they were 

                afraid to fight, don't believe in Saddam

                anyway.  They flew the gunship up here to

                hide out.  When they saw us they figured

                we were going to kill them, so they shot

                first. 

                          EPPS 

                Why'd he come in our camp. 

     Wes asks him the question in Arabic and gets an answer.  It's

     enough to give Wes a bit of a laugh. 

                          WES 

                Says he wanted food.  Liar.  He wanted

                the gold. 

                          EPPS 

                How's he going to want the gold?  He

                couldn't even know we had it.

                          WES 

                He...he could have been watching us.

                          JAEGER 

                Maybe we should give him some water. 

                          WES 

                All last night he could have been-- 

                          JAEGER 

                I think he wants something to drink. 

                          WES 

                I'm not wasting my water on him. 

     Jaeger gets his water and gives some to the soldier.

                          WES(CONT) 

                I don't care what he says, he wanted our

                gold.  Would have slit our throats if he

                had the chance.

                          EPPS 

                Doesn't matter.  Whatever he wanted he 

                didn't get it.  We've got no need staying

                around here.  It's light enough.  Let's

                pack up and head out. 

     Jaeger and Epps start to go for their gear.  Wes is still on

     the Iraqi soldier.

                          WES 

                What about him?  We...we have to do

                something.

     Epps gives an expression that screams:  What the hell are you

     talking about?

                          WES(CONT) 

                We can't just leave him.  He'll run back

                to his outfit, report our position... 

                          EPPS 

                You said he was a deserter. 

                          WES 

                That's what he says.  He could be a spy,

                or something. 

                          EPPS 

                You don't know that. 

                          WES

                You don't know he isn't. 

                          JAEGER 

                So we'll take him with us.  At least 'til

                we get back to the Hummer. 

                          WES 

                He'd just slow us down, and drink our

                water.  And if we ran into any more

                Iraqis you know he'd sell us out. 

                          EPPS 

                We don't leave him, we don't take him

                with us.  What does that leave? 

     By way of answering Wes lifts his M-16 and works the action.

                          EPPS(CONT) 

                You're out of your mind.

                          WES 

                He's an enemy soldier.

                          EPPS 

                I'm not going to let you kill him.

                          WES

                We're at war. 

     The discussion starts to get real heated.

                          EPPS 

                We are not at war!  You and I and Jaeger

                are AWOL.  We have no authority-- 

                          WES 

                He tried to kill us.  If not just now,

                then in the helicopter.  That's all the

                authority I need. 

     Jaeger goes somewhere near panic.

                          JAEGER

                We don't need to do this.  We got the 

                gold, all right?  Let's just get out of

                here. 

     The Iraqi may not speak the language, but he's got a pretty

     good idea what they are arguing about.  He starts to plead

     for his life

                          WES 

                I'm not going to leave him be just so he

                can stab us in the backs the minute we

                turn around.  I have been through too

                much to lose it all now just because the

                two of you don't have the stomach to do

                what has to be done. 

                          EPPS 

                I've got no stomach for murder. 

                          WES 

                It's a combat action. 

                          EPPS 

                It's murder, and I won't be any part of

                it. 

                          WES 

                Then step aside. 

                          EPPS

                No. 

                          WES 

                Get out of my way. 

     The Iraqis begging goes into over drive.  Jaeger just about

     loses it.

                          JAEGER 

                For Christ's sake, we don't need this.

                Let's just go.  Let's just...let's just

                get out of here. 

     Wes yells down at the Iraqi. 

                          WES 

                Shut up!  Shut the hell up! 

     Wes moves menacingly for the Iraqi.  He thrusts his M-16

     forward.  Epps grabs it, and throws a punch.  Unlike before 

     with Jaeger, this time Wes ducks the blow and swings the butt

     of the M-16 back at Epps.  It's not much of a blow though, 

     and Epps keeps on coming.  He barrels into Wes and takes him

     down. 

     As the two men tussle the Iraqi sees his chance to get away.

     He springs up, knocking Jaeger to the side, and bolts past

     him.

                          JAGER 

                He's getting away! 

     Epps turns and sees this.  Maybe he's not for killing this 

     guy, but he certainly can't just let him get away.  He takes

     off running after the Iraqi, Jaeger a step behind. 

     The Iraqi, face flush with fear; eyes filled with terror like

     a hunted animal, makes it to the rock face and starts to 

     climb to the plateau above.  He knows if he can make it he at

     least has a chance of getting away.  It shows in the

     desperation he climbs with. 

     Epps and Jaeger are right behind him.  They claw at the

     rocks, but can't gain ground.

     The Iraqi gets closer and closer to the plateau; to freedom.

     Our two soldiers scramble up right behind him.

     The Iraqi gets a hand on the lip of the plateau.  He's just

     about to pull himself up.  He's just about to get away-- 

     WE HEAR A SHORT BURST OF GUNFIRE.  Three large, bloody holes

     mushroom open in the Iraqi's back.

                                                            CUT TO:

     WES 

     He stands, smoke curling from the muzzle of his M-16 like a 

     white snake, having just send the Iraqi some bullets special

     delivery. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     THE IRAQI 

     He arches, stiffens, then falls like a stone past Epps and

     Jaeger to the ground below like a sack of potatoes.

     As the two climb down Wes goes to the body and stands over it

     like the great, white hunter standing over his kill.  All

     business like he says:

                          WES 

                I had to.  You saw how he ran.  Would

                have given us away.  I had to. 

     There's a beat of quiet, then: 

                          JAEGER 

                Maybe we ought to...you know, bury him.

                Say some words over him. 

                          WES 

                You want to say some words? 

     He sneers down at the body.

                          WES(CONT) 

                Go to hell.  How are those words? 

     Wes moves off.  A beat later Jaeger walks away.  Epps just

     stands there looking at the body. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. MESA - LATER 

     Wes, Epps and Jaeger are making the trek back down.  Jaeger 

     is shouldering the pack with the gold.  Wes has got his M-16. 

     Epps stops, and puts his pack down.  He takes out the navicom

     and a recon photo. 

                          EPPS

                We should head Northeast. 

                          JAEGER 

                Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer;

                further into Iraqi.

                          EPPS 

                There's another pass on the photo.  We 

                can avoid that narrow one we had to cross

                on the way up, and it should get us back

                down. 

                          JAEGER 

                It should, or it will?  Least going back

                the way we came we know what we're up

                against. 

                          EPPS 

                You think you can make that pass weighted

                down when you almost fell the first time

                you're wrong, and you're not going to 

                take my share of the gold with you trying

                it.  We're heading Northeast. 

     Really calm, cold and direct Wes says:

                          WES

                You've got an awful lot of orders in you.

                Always giving orders. 

                          EPPS 

                I out rank you, that's why. 

                          WES 

                In the service you do, but we're not 

                particularly in the service right now.

                Way I see it, what we're doing, that 

                doesn't particularly give you the right

                to toss orders around. 

     Epps loads up his pack pretty much ignoring Wes. 

                          EPPS 

                We been down this road.  I told you how

                it is.  Unless you feel like there's

                something you want to do about it... 

                          WES

                What if I do? 

     Epps says nothing, so Wes tries it again a little harder. 

                          WES(CONT)

                What if I do? 

     He works the action of his M-16. 

                          WES(CONT) 

                You talk loud, and don't even have a big

                stick to back it up with. 

     Real casual Epps takes a grenade from his belt and flips the

     pin loose.  He stands with the grenade in one hand and the

     navicom in the other.  Real calm, like he was talking about

     the weather:

                          EPPS 

                Something happens to me I let go of this

                grenade.  I go, and I take the navicom

                with me.  And how do you suppose you're 

                going to find your way back to the Hummer,

                when you won't even know what's up or 

                down.  It's a big country, and you could

                be heading for the allies, or wandering 

                right into Bhagdad.  That's if you don't

                die of thirst before you even get that

                far.  How you like my stick now? 

     Epps and Wes have a stare down.  Jaeger, who's getting really

     good at freaking out, jumps in. 

                          JAEGER 

                Why don't you put the gun down, all 

                right, Wes?  You put the gun down and 

                Epps'll put the pin back in the grenade.

                Won't you Epps? 

     The stare down goes on a beat longer.  Finally Wes lowers his

     rifle.  He turns to Jaeger and vents what anger he can. 

                          WES 

                I'm starting to think you're a real

                bitch, you know that?

                                                           FADE TO:

     EXT. DESERT - LATER 

     THE CAMERA PANS over the vast expanse of nothingness.  SMOKE 

     BEGINS TO DRIFT INTO FRAME.  THE CAMERA FINALLY LANDS ON THE

     SHI'ITE ENCAMPMENT, or at least what's left of it.  Tents are

     torn down and burned, goods scattered.  It looks like a ghost

     town.  Epps, Wes and Jaeger wander into it.  They look

     around, but see no signs of life. 

     Wes grabs up some Shi'ite garments, white robes, and starts

     to put them on. 

                          JAEGER 

                You're going to burn up in those. 

                          WES 

                The white reflects the sun; it keeps you

                cooler.  That's why they wear them. 

     Jaeger looks to Epps who just shrugs.  Jaeger gets some robes

     and puts them on.  Epps follows suit. 

                          JAEGER 

                Think the Iraqi's killed them all?

                          WES 

                Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest.

                Murderers. 

                          EPPS

                     (Pointed) 

                Murder, or a combat action?  It's hard to

                tell them apart? 

     They keep on moving, passing straight through the camp.  Epps

     marches ahead, not wanting to even deal with the other two 

     men.  Wes talks after him.  Really he talks more to himself,

     and he's not sounding too lucid. 

                          WES 

                You saw how he ran didn't you?  First

                chance he got he ran out.  Would have

                gone straight to his CO, told him all 

                about the gold.  What do you think would

                have happened then, huh?  Then what do 

                you think would have happened?  Two 

                thousand screaming Iraqis bearing down on

                us.  You ought to thank me for killing 

                him.  I'll get a medal for it.  Watch and

                see if I don't get a medal. 

     Epps isn't even paying attention, he's just walking on. 

     Almost, as if he senses something is wrong, he stops in his

     tracks.  He looks down at his feet and sees the most curious

     thing.  SAND IS RUSHING AWAY FROM HIS FEET, ALMOST AS IF IT'S

     GOING DOWN A DRAIN.  He looks at it with the same wonderment

     that a dog watches television. 

                          EPPS 

                What the hell...? 

     Epps has got all of about two seconds to ponder this as a

     moment later the Earth literally drops from beneath his feet.

     He's standing on a sink hole that opens up swallowing him in

     loose sand.  Immediately he sinks to waist level.  He slows

     there, but still goes down with rapidity.  He screams to 

     Jaeger and Wes.

                          EPPS(CONT)

                Help!  Help me! 

     Jaeger drops the gold and runs to the edge of the hole.  Wes

     doesn't move. 

                          EPPS(CONT)

                Help me!

     Jaeger is paralyzed by indecision.  He doesn't want to let

     Epps drown, but if he gets too close he could easily get 

     sucked into.  He flirts back and forth between rescue and

     safety. 

     Sand continues to pour in on Epps. 

                          EPPS(CONT) 

                For Christ's Sake, Jaeger!  Help me!

                Help me! 

     Jaeger can't fight himself any longer.  He lowers himself

     halfway into the hole, stretching spread eagle trying to keep

     some kind of grip on the firmer ground, and reaches for Epps. 

     Their arms twist and strain for each others.  First their 

     fingers meet, then they grab hands.  They work a grip down to

     their wrist, but that's all they can get.  Jaeger strains 

     like a field horse pulling Epps against the sand.  It may not

     be enough as he begins to slip down himself.  Jaeger twists

     his head and looks up at Wes.  Straining to say anything he

     pleads: 

                          JAEGER

                Wes...Wes! 

     His words fall on deaf ears.  Wes just takes a step closer to

     the pack of gold coins. 

     This only serves to energize Jaeger.  He digs deeper within

     himself finding an untapped reserve of strength.  He grunts

     and pulls, the veins on his neck puffing like balloons. 

     Epps finds same purchase.  He pulls, swims, his way up from

     the sand.  A little at first, but like hitting shallow water

     he's able to lift himself up. 

     Jager jerks him the rest of the way up to firm ground.  They

     collapse, chests heaving like pistons as they suck air. 

     As Epps regains strength he pats himself down.  Suddenly he

     goes back into a panic. 

                          EPPS

                The navicom!

     Epps rolls back over and thrusts his hands down into the soft

     sand frantically looking for the lost computer.  Jaeger joins

     in.  They dig and scrape as best they can, but daring to

     venture only so far into the soft sand.  It doesn't matter.

     The navicom is lost. 

                          JAEGER 

                What are we going to do?  How are we

                going to find our way back!? 

                          EPPS 

                We'll find our way. 

                          JAEGER

                How!? 

                          EPPS 

                We'll find our way!  We'll... 

     Epps wants to say how, but he's got no idea.  Wes grows a

     smug smile. 

                          WES 

                No navicom.  A lot of good you are now,

                Epps. 

                          EPPS 

                Lot of good you were when I was sinking

                in the sand. 

                          WES 

                Without that navicam looks to me like you

                forfeit the right to be in charge. 

                          EPPS 

                And let me guess who is. 

     Wes casually slides out his M-16.

                          WES 

                I'm the one's got the big stick. 

                          EPPS 

                Suppose I don't go for that? 

                          WES 

                Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and

                I suppose I'd have to kill you.

                     (Beat)

                I suppose. 

                          EPPS 

                What about Jaeger? 

                          WES 

                Nothing about him, unless he's got a

                problem about me dealing with you. 

                          JAEGER 

                Yeah, I got a problem with you killing Epps. 

     Wes turns and glares at Jaeger, who backs down. 

                          JAEGER(CONT}

                I mean, in principle. 

                          WES 

                     {Sneering) 

                You know, Jaeger, you really are a bitch. 

     Epps isn't wasting anymore time.  When Wes turns to glower at

     Jaeger he lunges up for him.  Wes side steps Epps and lands 

     the but of his rifle into the side of Epps' head.  It opens a

     wound, and sends Epps back down to the ground. 

     Epps looks up right into the muzzle of West M-16.  Full of

     poison: 

                          WES(CONT)

                You die! 

     Wes is just about to squeeze back the trigger when a shot 

     rings out.  Wes' body jerks like he's just been hit in the

     back with a truck.  The way cut timber falls he slams to the

     ground motionless. 

     Epps and Jaeger stare at the body for a beat, then snap their

     heads in the direction of the shot. 

     Up on a dune behind them are a group of SHI'ITES on 

     horseback.  One of them has a high powered rifle which he has

     just used to drill Wes.  He fires another shot.  It pings to

     the ground between Epps and Jaeger. 

     Our two remaining men scramble.  Jaeger dives for the gold 

     and snatches it up from the ground as bullets zip around it.

     The two take off running as best they can in the sand.  They

     run wildly, erratically, without looking back.  They run

     until their bodies scream no more, then keep going on 

     inertia.  Reaching a dune they tumble down the far side and

     collapse in a heap at the bottom.  They take a moment to

     catch what breath they can, then: 

                          EPPS 

                We got to go back.  We got to go back for

                Wes. 

                          JAEGER

                Forget Wes. 

                          EPPS

                We can't just leave him. 

                          JAEGER

                Wes is dead! 

                          EPPS 

                What if he's not? 

                          JAEGER 

                Then he will be when those Iraqis get to

                him.  He was going to kill you.  He was 

                one blink away from it.  He's dead, Epps,

                and I'm sure as hell not getting my head

                blow off over his carcass. 

     They sit there trying to catch their breath.  As they do a

     sound comes from the distance.  They freeze, ears cocked,

     trying to figure out what it is. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)

                It's a helicopter. 

     Quickly, desperately, as the sound of the chopter draws 

     closer, they scan the horizon looking for it.  Jaeger spots

     it and thrusts a finger in its direction. 

                          JAGER(CONT)

                There. 

     Epps scrambles out his binoculars.  He targets the

     helicopter.  Jaeger waits in high anticipation. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)

                Ours, or theirs? 

     Epps can't make out for sure.  Jaeger asks again with growing

     anxiety. 

                          JAEGER(CONT) 

                Ours, or theirs?

     Epps takes a long, hard stare.

                          EPPS 

                Ours.  It's one of ours.  We've got to

                signal them; let them know we're down

                here. 

     The instant Jaeger hears this his face twists up like he's

     thinking something, and he doesn't like what it is he's

     thinking.  Quietly, almost to himself: 

                          JAEGER

                No.

                          EPPS 

                We need something:  A flare, a signal

                mirror. 

     Again Jaeger says it, this time including Epps too. 

                          JAEGER

                No. 

                          EPPS 

                What do you mean no?  They can fly us home. 

                          JAEGER(CONT) 

                They'll ask questions; want to know why

                we were out here. 

                          EPPS

                We'll lie. 

                          JAEGER 

                They'll search the pack. 

     Epps finds a mirror in one of his pockets.  He stands, ready

     to signal the chopter. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)

                They'll find the gold. 

     Epps turns sharply back to Jaeger.

                          EPPS 

                We're lost, you understand that?  We've

                got no navicom, and no means to find a

                way back.  So right now I don't give a 

                damn about the gold because if we don't 

                get off this desert, and out of Iraqi all

                it's going to be good for is buying us

                tombstones. 

     Epps is back around ready to signal the helicopter.  He's

     about to raise the mirror when he hears the sound of an M-16

     action being worked.  Epps turns to face Jaeger. 

                          JAEGER 

                I can't do it, Epps.  Not when we're so 

                close.  I can't let you ruin everything. 

     Epps just stares at Jaeger, not frightened, but surprisingly

     calm.

                          EPPS 

                First Wes, now you? 

                          JAEGER 

                I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.

                          EPPS 

                     (Sarcastic) 

                And you; you've got it all together. 

                          JAEGER 

                I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't 

                kill you just to kill you, but I can't 

                let you lose the gold for me.  Not when

                we're so close. 

                          EPPS 

                That helicopter passes, and the only

                thing we're close to is death. 

     Jaeger is unfazed.  Very politely he says:

                          JAEGER

                Sit down, Epps. 

     Epps takes him up on the offer.  What choice does he have?

     THE CAMERA STAYS TIGHT ON THE TWO MEN.  They don't talk.

     They don't move.  They just sit as WE HEAR THE SOUND OF THE

     HELICOPTER GETTING CLOSER AND LOUDER.  IT REACHES A

     CRESCENOO, THEN BEGINS TO FADE UNTIL IT DISAPPEARS.  The

     chopter is gone, along with Epps and Jaeger's best chance of 

     getting out of the desert alive. 

     Jaeger lowers his rifle.  Very genuinely he says:

                          JAEGER(CONT) 

                I'm sorry about that, Epps. 

                          EPPS

                Is it all right if I stand up? 

     Like he didn't know he was keeping Epps from something. 

                          JAEGER 

                Oh, yeah.  Go ahead. 

     Epps stands.  He looks around trying to figure things out. 

     Not much to figure.  There still in the middle of a desert in

     a hostile country same as they ever were. 

                          JAEGER(CONT) 

                I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm

                glad it didn't come to that. 

                          EPPS 

                Yeah.  Well, me too. 

                          JAEGER 

                I never killed anybody before.  I talk a

                good game, but I'm not like that. 

                          EPPS

                Sure. 

                          JAEGER 

                Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was 

                talking I wanted to blow away all those

                Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I

                was scared out of my mind to go to war.

                I still haven't gotten over stepping on

                that land mine. 

                          EPPS 

                You still got a map on you? 

                          JAEGER

                What?  Yeah. 

     Jaeger takes out the maps he has and hands them to Epps. 

     Epps looks them over, then looks over the terrain.  Without

     any landmarks or navigating tools the maps might as well be

     finger paintings.

                          JAEGER(CONT)

                Epps? 

                          EPPS

                Yeah. 

                          JAEGER 

                I don't want to die. 

                          EPPS 

                Makes two of us. 

                          JAEGER 

                I know what I did just now was crazy, but

                you got to understand how much I want

                that gold. 

                          EPPS 

                It's all right.  I don't like it, but

                it's over now. 

                          JAEGER 

                I never had anything before, Epps.  I

                never was anybody.  Not the kind of 

                somebody you can be with a pocket full of

                gold coins.  When I was in high school I 

                used to-- 

     Fed up with Jaeger Epps turns on him hard.

                          EPPS 

                Hey, you know what?  Can I be honest with

                you?  Right now I'm not all that 

                interested in how you're messed up 'cause

                you didn't get the bicycle you wanted for

                your thirteenth birthday.  What I'm 

                interested in is how I can keep from

                getting dead.  And listening to sob 

                stories from some           about how the

                system wasn't good to him because he had

                to work like everybody else instead of

                being born a Kennedy doesn't do a damn 

                thing to help keep me alive.  So do me a 

                favor; either shut up, or...just shut up. 

     Jaeger isn't sure what to say. 

                          JAEGER

                Sorry. 

                          EPPS 

                Damn. 

     Epps sits down in the sand, all out of ideas.  There's a long

     quiet before Jaeger says:

                          JAEGER 

                What do you think our chances are? 

                          EPPS 

                If we can find the Hummer, or some 

                friendlies by sundown we might be okay. 

                We've got enough water for that.  But we

                won't make another day otherwise. 

     Again they sit for a beat.

                          JAEGER

                Wonder how the war's going? 

                          EPPS 

                It's got to be going better than this.. 

     Epps stands and has a last look around. 

                          EPPS{CONT) 

                All right.  pick a direction. 

     Jaeger just gives a surprised look. 

                          EPPS(CONT) 

                We can't just sit here.  We've got to

                start moving, so pick. 

                          JAEGER 

                You sure you want me too? 

     Epps nods.  Jaeger stands and takes a good look around.  He

     considers things, although there isn't much to consider.

     Finally he decisively points in a direction. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)

                I pick that way. 

                          EPPS 

                Okay.  Then we go this way. 

     Epps heads off in the opposite direction. 

                                                           FADE TO:

     EXT. DESERT - LATER 

     Epps and Jaeger make the long march across the sand.  There's

     so much nothing out there it's maddening. 

                                                           FADE TO:

     EXT. DESERT - LATER 

     Epps drops down in the sand.  He lets his pack slide fram his 

     back, then pulls his water and takes a healthy swig.  He puts

     his pack back on and struggles to his feet.  As Jaeger

     crosses he takes Epps by the shoulder and helps to pull him

     up.  The two wade on. 

                                                           FADE TO:

     EXT. DESERT - EVENING 

     Epps and Jaeger are trekking as they have been doing all day. 

     They look worn out, but they keep moving.  Jaeger is several

     paces behind Epps. 

                          JAEGER

                Getting cold.

                          EPPS 

                It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at

                night; they get cold. 

                          JAEGER 

                Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a

                second. 

                          EPPS

                No! 

                          JAEGER 

                Just let me rest for a second. 

                          EPPS 

                We've got to keep moving while there's

                still light. 

                          JAEGER 

                You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just

                going to take a second.  I want to look

                at the gold. 

                          EPPS 

                Don't you touch it. 

                          JAEGER 

                I just want to look at it.  Remind me of

                what I'm dying for. 

                          EPPS 

                The deal was no one touches it until we

                get out of here. 

                          JAEGER 

                Yeah, but we made that deal while Wes was

                still alive.  He's gone.  Time for a new

                deal. 

     Jaeger takes the pack from his back and starts to open it.

     Epps turns and races back to him grabbing him by the wrist

     and forcing Jaeger to let go of the pack. 

                          EPPS 

                You listen to me.  If, 

if

 we get out of

                this I don't care what you do with your 

                share, but until then you've only got one

                thing to think about and that's staying 

                alive.  So you leave that gold alone, or

                you and I are going to have to have a

                serious talk. 

     Epps waits for a response from Jaeger, but gets none. 

     Jaeger's eyes seem to be glazed, and his stare fixed on a

     point well beyond Epps.  He raises a hand, points off into 

     the distance. 

                          JAEGER

                Look. 

     Epps turns and looks.  Off a ways is a light in the window of

     what looks to be a shack-type building.  Epps stares at it as

     if it were the holy Grail 

                          JAEGER(CONT) 

                What do you figure it is? 

                          EPPS 

                Place all alone like that?  Must be a

                boarder check point. 

                          JAEGER 

                Which boarder?  Saudi?  Kuwait?  Syria? 

                          EPPS 

                Couldn't be Syria.  We couldn't have gone

                that far north.  It's got to be Saudi.

                Come on. 

     Epps heads for the shack doing double time.  Jaeger puts the

     pack back on and races to catch up. 

                          EPPS(CONT} 

                They've got to have water.  We'll get 

                same water, some directions, maybe they

                even have a vehicle. 

                          JAEGER

                Epps. 

                          EPPS 

                We can head back for our lines, and they

                don't even have to know about the gold. 

                          JAEGER 

                Epps.  What if they're not Saudi. 

     Epps stops dead, now not more than one hundred meters from

     the shack. 

                          JAEGER(CONT) 

                If it's a checkpoint, it could be Iraqi. 

     Epps considers this.

                          EPPS 

                We've got no cboice.  Either way, we've

                got no choice. 

     Epps and Jaeger keep on for the shack walking with

     apprehension now instead of running.  Epps stops less than

     fifty meters away. 

                          JAEGER

                Well? 

                          EPPS 

                Well, we should identify ourselves. 

                          JAEGER 

                Yeah, I guess we should. 

     Epps takes in a deep breath ready to yell to the shack.

     Instead he turns to Jaeger. 

                          EPPS 

                Even if they are Iraqis probably all

                they'll do is take us prisoner for

                awhile.  Got to figure we're still 

                kicking their asses in the war.  They

                don't want any trouble.

                          JAEGER 

                Hell, they'll probably just surrender to

                us.  Probably. 

     Again Epps takes a deep breath.  And again just as he's about 

     to cry out he turns to Jaeger. 

                          EPPS

                That's if the war is even still going on.

                Way things were shaping up it's probably

                long over. 

                          JAEGER

                Probably. 

     Epps takes a beat, then sucks in a breath.  He yells for the

     shack: 

                          EPPS

                Hellooooo-- 

     Before Epps can even finish getting the word out machine gun 

     fire erupts from the house and burns towards Epps and Jaeger.

     They dive for cover, hugging the ground as bullets whistle 

     and ping through the space around them.  They are forced back

     and down against a narrow stretch of rock, but it offers 

     little protection and is chipped away by the hot lead.  It's 

     just a matter of moments before nothing stands before them

     and death.  At the top of his lungs Jaeger starts yelling: 

                          JAEGER 

Ashra Ka mahari dahra sahib!  Ashra Ka

                mahari dahra sahib!

     Just as quickly as it began the shooting stops.  From the

     shack we hear some chatter in Arabic, then the door opens.  A

     few MEN appear in the doorway.  They laugh and beckon for

     Epps and Jaeger to join them. 

                          EPPS 

                What did you say? 

                          JAEGER 

                I don't know.  Something Wes had taught

                me.  I think it means "Don't shoot.

                We're your friends." 

                          EPPS 

                They must be Saudis.  It's a Saudi 

                checkpoint.  Oh sweet, Jesus.  Come on.

                Come on! 

     Epps hurriedly stumbles in the dark for the shack.  Jaeger is

     just steps behind him. 

     They enter the dimly lit shack to the good nature of the FOUR

     men inside.  Epps and Jaeger see a fire in an open hearth and

     go right to it to warm their bands as the four men go on

     chattering behind them. 

                          JAGER 

                Oh, man, this is good.  What do you think

                the chances are they've got a whirlpool

                in this place? 

     As they rub their hands together Epps looks up.  He freezes.

     Hanging on the wall is a very handsome, nicely framed 

     portrait of Saddam Hussein.  Epps nudges Jaeger who also

     looks up.  He also freezes. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)

                Oh, God... 

                          EPPS 

                They must have thought we were Iraqi when

                you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell

                in the dark. 

                          JAEGER

                What are we going to do? 

     Epps thinks.  What are they going to do?

                          EPPS 

                Slip out your M-16. 

                          JAEGER

                And then what? 

                          EPPS 

                And then shoot them. 

                          JAEGER 

                I...I never killed anyone before.  I told

                you that. 

                          EPPS 

                Well, you're going to start with a bang,

                'cause you've got four of them to take down. 

     Behind Epps and Jaeger one of the Iraqis asks a question of

     them in Arabic. 

                          JAEGER 

                Can't you-- 

                          EPPS 

                I don't have a weapon. 

     Again the Iraqi asks the question.  We can tell by the tone

     of his voice he expects an answer. 

                          EPPS(CONT)

                Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going

                to kill me.  Kill them! 

                          JAEGER 

                I just said I would.  I don't think I-- 

                          EPPS

                Shoot them! 

     The Iraqis sense that something is wrong.  They move

     menacingly for their weapons. 

                          EPPS(CONT)

                Shoot them, Jaeger!  SHOOT THEM! 

     Jaeger whips around at the same time pulling his M-16.  He 

     jerks back hard on the trigger spraying back and forth, back 

     and forth. 

     Dig it:  The Iraqis do a death dance in the strobe light of 

     the muzzle flashes.  They do the twist, they do the jerk,

     then they all fall down. 

     The bullets that miss do a nasty job of redecorating the

     place; shredding walls, eating up wood. 

     Jaeger keeps firing until his clip is empty.  He stands 

     huffing, eyes glazed like he's a million miles away from what

     he just did.  Epps steps up and takes the weapon from Jaeger.

     That's like an alarm clock that brings Jaeger back to the 

     land of the living.  Jaeger takes one look around at all the

     carnage, then doubles over and gets to puking. 

     Epps just watches this pathetic sight.  When Jaeger is all

     done: 

                          EPPS(CONT)

                Let's get some sleep. 

                                                           FADE TO: 

     BLACK 

                                                           FADE TO:

     INT. SHACK - MORNING 

     The sun has just pushed itself well above the horizon as 

     Jaeger comes awake.  The second he does he sees a MAN - Arab,

     wearing white robes - peering through the window.  Jaeger 

     gives a start, and the man disappears.  Jaeger quickly shakes

     Epps awake. 

                          JAEGER 

                Epp...Epps!  There's someone at the

                window!

     This wakes Epps up quick. 

                          EPPS

                An Iraqi? 

                          JAEGER 

                I don't know.  He didn't have a uniform 

                on.  He...he had on white robes, like the

                guys who killed Wes.

     Epps does some quick figuring, then staying low, scrambles

     across the floor to one of the dead Iraqis and grabs up his

     weapon.  He grabs another one tosses it to Jaeger.

     Carefully, still low, Epps creeps over to the window.  Slowly

     he raises up and looks out. 

                          JAGER(CONT)

                See anything? 

                          EPPS

                Nothing. 

     Epps lowers himself back down and does some thinking. 

                          JAEGER

                What do we do? 

                          EPPS 

                We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't

                an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of

                time before some show up.  Get all the 

                water you can carry, and we'll head out

                on foot. 

                          JAEGER 

                To where? 

                          EPPS 

                Sun rises in the East.  We go the

                opposite direction.  May not find 

                anything, but at least we'll know we're

                heading towards Saudi Arabia. 

     As Jaeger gathers up what water he can find, creeps for

     the door.  With the muzzle of his gun he pulls it open a

     crack and peers out.  Still nothing.  It's like the man

     vanished into thin air. 

     Jaeger, stocked up on water, comes over with the gold and

     Epps' pack which Epps shoulders.

                          EPPS(CONT)

                Ready? 

     Jaeger nods.  Epps opens the door, and the two men carefully

     snake their way out weapons at the ready.  It seems, though,

     there is nothing to be ready for.  There is no one around. 

     Suddenly the man appears from around the shack.  Epps and

     Jaeger turn on him targeting with their assault weapons, but

     they do not fire.  The man just stands.  He doesn't say

     anything, he makes no threatening moves.  The three stay 

     still as statues for several beats until Epps jerks his head

     indicating to Jaeger they should move on.  That they do,

     weapons still on the man, until they are beyond his range.

     They walk on a little ways.  Jaeger spots something, and

     thrusts a finger in its direction.

                          JAEGER

                Look! 

     Mounted on a horse, riding on a dune that runs parallel to

     them, is ANOTHER ARAB MAN.  He makes no effort to draw nearer

     to Epps and Jaeger, but nor does he lose them.

                          JAEGER(CONT)

                What do we do? 

                          EPPS 

                We keep going, that's what we do.  We

                ignore them, maybe they ignore us.

     As if to be contrary to Epps' statement ANOTHER TWO ARABS ON

     HORSE BACK appear up over a dune before them.

                          JAEGER

                Jesus!  How many of them are there? 

     Epps doesn't know, and he doesn't want to find out.  They 

     change direction heading away from the Arabs.  But again MORE

     ARABS ride up over a dune.  Epps gets the feeling he and

     Jaeger are about to be boxed in. 

                          EPPS 

                I don't like this.  Let's go. 

     Epps breaks into a run.  Jaeger is only steps behind him. 

     Like something out of an old John Ford western dozens of 

     mounted Arabs suddenly appear over a dune.  They ride fast 

     and hard for Epps and Jaeger like Apaches heading for a wagon

     train.  They easily overtake our two, momentarily swallowing

     them amongst the thundering hoofs, and ride on a bit as if

     playing with them. 

     Epps and Jaeger stop, then bolt in the other direction.  The

     Arabs ride back, again past Epps and Jaeger swiping them to

     the ground; the horses kicking up a spray of lose sand over

     them.  It looks like a cattle round up, and our two are the

     cattle. 

     Epps and Jaeger get up to make another run of it, and again

     the Arabs bear down on them.  This time they mean business.

     They completely surround them, cutting off all means of 

     escape.  The Arabs start screaming something back and forth

     in Arabic.  We don't know what, but it sounds unpleasant. 

     Epps and Jaeger come skidding to a halt.  They turn in their

     tracks digging in the scene.  It goes like this:  They are

     completely outnumbered and out gunned by a mounted force.

     Doesn't get any simpler. 

     Epps and Jaeger drop their weapons.  Their hands go in the

     air. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. SHI'ITE CAMP - LATER 

     The mounted Arabs lead Epps and Jaeger, hands tied before 

     them and almost literally being towed by the horses, into 

     their camp.  It is similar to the Shi'ite camps we've seen

     before with several tent dwellings. 

     As the party enters groups of Shi'ites come over to stare at

     Epps and Jaeger.  They chatter amongst themselves, but our 

     boys have no idea what they're talking about, and that just

     makes things all the scarier.

     From our boy's point of view this is all like an unending

     nightmare:  Being dragged along through a desert, not knowing

     the language, not knowing what's going to happen.  Their 

     world skews and slides as if they were on a tilt-a-whirl. 

     Finally they reach a tent.  One of the Arabs tosses Epps and

     Jaeger's packs on the ground just before it.  Another cuts

     them loose and SHOVES THEM INSIDE THE TENT, then yells 

     something at them in Arabic.  He leaves, and our two are

     alone. 

                          JAEGER 

                What do you make of them? 

                          EPPS 

                Shi'ites, I think. 

                          JAEGER 

                Is that good, or bad? 

                          EPPS 

                I don't know.  They killed Wes. 

                          JAEGER 

                Why haven't they killed us!? 

                          EPPS

                I don't know! 

                          JAEGER 

                ...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way

                out. 

                          EPPS 

                With what?  Against how many? 

                          JAEGER 

                We can't just sit here waiting to die. 

                          EPPS 

                You come up with a better plan, let me

                know. 

                          JAEGER 

                Maybe...maybe if we traded them the gold.

                If we gave it to them they might let us

                live; they might not kill us. 

     From O.C. we hear a voice:

                          VOICE(O.C.)

                I always knew you were a bitch.

     Epps and Jaeger's hearts seize up and stop.  It's as if

     they've heard the voice of a ghost, and they have.  IT'S WES!

     He carries with him the pack of gold.  Epps can barely get

     his name out.

                          EPPS

                ...Wes...?

                          JAEGER

                You were shot.  We were standing right

                there, you were shot!

                          WES

                In the flack jacket.  Still like getting

                hit in the back with a baseball bat.

                Took the air right out of me, but I was

                just unconscious for awhile.  'Course,

                you didn't stick around to find that out.

                You left me for dead.

                          EPPS

                We thought--

     Like a guy who just took two steps over the edge:

                          WES

                YOU LEFT ME FOR DEAD!

     Ohhh, shit.  Somebody's crazy.  Epps gets the feeling there's

     not going to be much dialog going on here.  Wes gets real

     calm again, which is almost as scary as him acting nuts.

                          WES(CONT)

                When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had

                shot an American they were very

                apologetic.  Turns out we've been kicking

                ass in this little war.  They figure

                we've finally gotten Saddam off their

                backs.  They brought me to their camp,

                cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new

                best buddy.  America number one, Joe.

                But there's something the Shi'ites can't

                figure out:  They can't figure out why my

                two buddies, two fellow Americans, left

                me out in the desert.  They can't seem to

                figure out what those same two guys were

                doing in an Iraqi outpost.  It's almost

                as if they were Iraqi spies, or

                something.  And I've got to tell you they

                hate anything that's got to do with the

                Iraqis.  See how I mean?

                          JAEGER 

                We had to take shelter in the checkpoint.

                Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there. 

                          WES 

                You actually got around to killing 

                someone.  I'm impressed.  I guess you're

                only half a bitch. 

                          EPPS 

                Wes, we thought you were dead, and we 

                thought we were next.  Hanging around to

                get killed wouldn't have done anyone any

                good. 

                          WES 

                Sure, and I guess it was just convenient

                there was one less person to split the

                gold with. 

                          EPPS

                Wes-- 

                          WES 

                Look, I know you guys are telling the 

                truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know

                that.  I guess you could tell them...but 

                then you don't speak the language do you?

     Wes gets right up into Jaeger's face. 

                          WES{CONT)

                Do you!? 

     Of course Wes knows they don't.  He allows himself a very

     sweet, shit eating grin. 

                          WES{CONT) 

                They're going to kill you slow.  I'll see

                to that. 

     He steps away and starts to open the pack of gold. 

                          WES(CONT) 

                Thanks for taking care of this for me.

                          EPPS 

                Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy,

                greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says

                you're crazy. 

                          JAEGER 

                I didn't say that.  I never said-- 

                          EPPS 

                Me?  I say you don't have enough brains

                to be stupid. 

     For a second Wes is taken by surprise by the statement, but

     he smiles at Epps' boldness.  He sets down the pack of gold

     and gets right up into Epps' face. 

                          WES 

                You disappoint me, Epps.  Always figured

                you to be a man; a real bright guy.  I

                had respect for you. 

                          EPPS 

                That why you tried to put a bullet in my

                head in the middle of the desert.

                          WES 

                That's just what things came to. 

                Sometimes you can't help that.  It 

                doesn't change me respecting you.  And

                now you let me down.  I expected more

                from you, you know?  I really did.  I 

                expected you to-- 

     A KNIFE SLIDES UP INTO FRAME UNTIL THE THE TIP RESTS JUST

     UNDER WES' THROAT, CHOKING OFF HIS WORDS. 

     Now it's Epps' turn to go smug. 

                          EPPS 

                You expect this? 

     Wes' got nothing to say.  To Jaeger:

                          EPPS(CONT)

                Get the gold! 

     Jaeger grabs up the pack. 

                          EPPS(CONT)

                     (To Wes) 

                Now let's try things another way.  Let's

                try this:  You and me and Jaeger are

                going to walk out of here.  We're going

                to walk out all smiling and friendly so 

                your little Shi'ite buddies won't suspect

                a thing.  Then we're going to hop on some

                horses, and ride away, and live happily 

                ever after.  It's all going to happen

                just like that, because if it doesn't 

                then I'm going to gut you like a fat pig.

                You understand me...soldier? 

     Wes says nothing.

                          EPPS(CONT) 

                I'll take that as a yes. 

     Epps gruffly spins Wes around and presses the knife up

     against his back so that it is hidden. 

     EPPS MARCHES WES OUTSIDE THE TENT, stopping momentarily to

     grab up his pack with his free hand.  To Jaeger he says: 

                          EPPS(CONT)

                Get the water.

     Jaeger does as he's told. 

                          WES 

                They'll kill you.  You won't make it ten

                feet before they cut you down. 

                          EPPS 

                You don't know John Epps very well, do

                you?

                          JAEGER 

                Can you ride a horse? 

                          EPPS 

                No, but I figure now's a real good time

                to start. 

     They walk on through the camp towards some saddled horses.

     They pass a Shi'ite who says something to Wes in Arabic.

     Epps gives Wes a poke in the back with the knife. 

                          EPPS(CONT)

                Don't say anything. 

     The Shi'ite, obviously expecting an answer, says whatever it

     was he said again. 

                          EPPS(CONT)

                Just keep quiet. 

                          WES 

                I have to answer him.

                          EPPS

                So you can give us away? 

                          WES 

                If I don't answer, he'll know something's

                up.

     Epps gives this a lot of thought in a very short time.

                          EPPS 

                You answer him, but you answer him wrong

                and you're going to be staring at your

                insides while you're dying. 

     Wes very calmly says something to the Shi'ite.  The Shi'ite 

     just stands there for a beat looking at the three men, then

     suddenly explodes in screams.  No way of knowing for sure

     what he's saying, but since he's going off like a Westec

     alarm it's a pretty good bet he's been tipped of.

     Epps rears back a fist and slams it into Wes' face.

                          EPPS(CONT)

                Bastard! 

     Epps and Jaeger take off running for the horses, practically

     leaping into the saddles as Shi'ites come pouring out of 

     their tents.  Forgetting himself, Wes screams in English. 

                          WES

                Stop them! 

     Jaeger and Epps spur their horses and take off riding hard.

     It's amazing what you can do when a bunch of angry Shi'ites

     are chasing you.

     Wes grabs an assault weapon from a near by Shi'ite and mounts

     up with blood in his eyes.  He leads a charge of armed, 

     mounted Shi'ites that looks like a posse going after some bad

     men. 

     Out front Epps and Jaeger pull up for a second.

                          JAEGER

                They coming? 

     Epps takes a look behind him.  He can't hardly miss the

     sandstorm Wes and the Shi'ites kick up as they ride for them. 

                          EPPS 

                Oh, yeah.  They're coming. 

     Epps points off to some foothills in the distance.  It's the

     only thing close to cover for miles around.

                          EPPS(CONT) 

                Ride for the hills.  We'll try to lose 

                them.

     They take the reigns to their horses and get to riding.

     Behind them Wes yells to his riders, and signals for them to

     split up, and try to cut off Epps and Jaeger.

     Epps and Jaeger hit the hills.  They ride up for a bit, then

     stop to spot Wes.  Wes and his crew are better riders and 

     have closed the gap.  All the two can do now is try to lose

     them in the terrain.

     Epps and Jaeger ride as best they can, and somewhat 

     erratically to cover their trail.  They head up a ways, then

     cut across in a parallel direction.  Jaeger looks back, but

     sees no sign of Wes. 

                          JAEGER

                We lost them! 

     Just as the words leave Jaeger's mouth a hail of bullets 

     explodes the ground before them.  Their horses rear up, and

     it's all they can do to fight them.  Just ahead are the

     Shi'ites who split off from Wes, having circled around Epps

     and Jaeger. 

     The two yank their horses back, and ride hard in the opposite

     direction with the Shi'ites just behind.  They fire on Epps

     and Jaeger, the bullets pinging off the rocks all around them. 

     Epps and Jaeger are little more than passengers on their

     horses as they run wild like stampeding mustangs.  And good

     for it, too, otherwise they might be dead by now.  They break

     for a trail that leads further up the mountain, but it

     does little to shake loose their pursuers. 

     As Epps and Jaeger level out they can see the trail below

     them, and Wes and his posse riding for them.  Our two start

     back the way they came. but the other Shi'ites crest the

     hill.

                          JAEGER(CONT)

                Which way? 

     Epps looks from side to side.  Either way is certain death.

     Then he looks off towards an embankment.  It is VERY steep.

     VERY treacherous. 

     It would take an expert rider to make it down the embankment 

     safely.  All Epps knows is there aren't any gun totting

     Shi'ites in that direction. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)

                Which way do we go!? 

                          EPPS

                We go this way. 

     Fear gives way to desperation.  Both men whip their steeds

     hard.  The beasts leap to the embankment and start the wild

     ride down.  Both Epps and Jaeger have to lean back in their

     saddles until they're almost parallel to the ground just to

     stay on their horses. 

     Wes sees this and swears.  He signals to his men to cut back

     the other way. 

     Epps reaches the bottom of the embankment.  Jaeger is almost

     there when he looses control of his horse.  Both rider and

     animal go tumbling in an ugly fall. 

                          EPPS(CONT)

                Jaeger!

     The horse gets up and bolts off before Jaeger can get to her. 

     Just then Wes and his men make it back down the trail, and

     start riding hard for Jaeger.

     Epps pulls his horse around and takes off for his fallen

     comrade.  As he rides in he leans to the side and low.

     Stretching out an arm Epps literally scoops Jaeger, and

     swings him up behind him.  A couple of rodeo performers

     couldn't have done it better. 

     Problem is with the extra weight they can't go very fast.

     Wes and his men close hard now.  The bullets fly fast and

     furious swarming all around our boys.

     Epps whips the horse, trying to get everything she's got to

      give.  This is it:  They get away now, or not at all.  Their

     horse finds a little something extra.  She goes faster,

     faster...

     Suddenly Epps pulls up hard on the reins.  The horse rears

     up, she goes wild.  It takes everything Epps has to control

     her.  But better that than if she'd taken another stride.

     They've come to the edge of a very, very sharp cliff.  Epps

     may be a good rider for a novice, but no way he could get

     this beast to fly. 

     Finally he calms the horse down, but it doesn't matter.  Wes

     and the Shi'ites ride up behind them cutting them off.  Wes

     stands down from his horse.

     Epps and Jaeger, with nowhere to go, do the same. 

                          WES

                The gold; give it to me.

     Epps takes the pack from Jaeger, but doesn't throw it to Wes.

                          WES(CONT)

                Give it to me! 

                          EPPS 

                If I give it to you, will you let us go? 

     Wes smiles and lies so badly he doesn't even bother trying to

     fake it. 

                          WES 

                Sure.  Whatever you want.  For old time

                sake.

     Epps has got no choice, really.  He tosses the pack to Wes' 

     feet who stoops to pick it up.  Wes starts to open the pack.

                          WES(CONT)

                Looks like at the end of the day we 

                finally find out who's better than who, 

                don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected

                more from you. 

                          EPPS

                It's like I said; you don't really know

                lieutenant John Epps very well, do you? 

     Wes rips open the pack.  He's got about one second to see

     what's inside.  NO GOLD.  JUST A BOOBY TRAPPED CLAYMORE MINE.

     Epps grabs Jaeger and yanks to him to the ground. 

     There is a horrific furry of sound and fire that easily

     destroys Wes and a few of the Shi'ite standing next to him.

     The rest, along with the horses, scatter for dear life.

     Epps stays down until the coast is clear, then gets up.

     Jaeger, to say the least, is stunned. 

                          EPPS(CONT)

                Damn it.  We lost the horses.

                          JAEGER

                The...the gold... 

                          EPPS 

                It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore

                mine.  The gold's in my pack.

                          JAEGER

                When did you make the switch?

                          EPPS 

                It's always been like that.  When you 

                left me down in the crevice to send the

                gold up I figured I'd better...take 

                precautions.  I rigged it to blow if 

                anyone opened the pack.  Just in case 

                somebody thought they could do better on

                their own. 

                          JAEGER

                But...

                          EPPS 

                We had a deal.  No one touches the gold

                until we're out of here.  No one breaks

                the deal, no one had anything to worry

                about.

                          JAEGER 

                What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I

                mean, accidently, what if I had... 

                          EPPS

                You shouldn't think about things like

                that.  It'll just make you crazy. 

     We hold on the two men, on the smoking remains of Wes.  We

     hold on them, then:

                                                           FADE TO:

     BLACK 

                                                           FADE TO:

     EXT. DESERT/ROAD - LATER 

     Epps and Jaeger come up to the road, a small highway.  It's 

     eerie; a road in the middle of the desert.  Quiet.  No cars.

     They just stand and stare at it for a beat.

                          JAEGER

                Well? 

                          EPPS 

                A car's got to come along sooner or

                later.  When it does, we jack it. 

                          JAEGER 

                How do we do that? 

                          EPPS 

                You lie in the middle of the road, look

                like you're hurt.  When the car stops I

                run over to the driver and put a gun to

                his head. 

                          JAEGER 

                Why do I have to lie in the road? 

                          EPPS 

                Somebody has to.

                          JAEGER 

                Yeah, but why me?  What if the car

                doesn't stop? 

                          EPPS 

                Then I'm a rich man. 

     Epps sits by the side of the road waiting for a car.  The

     only thing he gets is more quiet.  Jaeger sits next to him.

     After a couple of beats: 

                          JAEGER

                Epps. 

                          EPPS

                Yeah. 

                          JAEGER 

                I want you to know... I don't know.  I

                just think you're a hell of a guy. 

                          EPPS

                Thanks. 

                          JAEGER 

                This whole time, you've kept your head.

                You didn't go money simple like me and 

                Wes.  You've just been trying to figure

                how to get us out of here.  And you've

                been fair too.  I mean, even after 

                I...you know... 

                          EPPS 

                Threatened to blow my brains out? 

                          JAEGER 

                Yeah.  Even after that.  You didn't take

                it out on me, except for maybe making me

                lie in the middle of the road now.  But

                I'd say you've been very fair.  I just 

                think it's a hell of a man who can keep

                from going money simple. 

                          EPPS 

                Don't make so much out of it.  Only

                reason I haven't figured a way to get all

                that money for myself is because I've

                been too busy figuring ways to stay 

                alive.  Believe me; if I had a minute to

                catch my breath I might have played 

                things the way you and Wes had.  I'm no 

                better than anybody else.  I've just been

                busier. 

     They sit a while more.  Still no car.

                          JAEGER

                Epps?

                What? 

                          JAEGER 

                I'm thinking about taking a trip. 

                          EPPS 

                Thought you were going to buy a car. 

                          JAEGER

                Still am.  There's more gold than I 

                thought, and since there's only two of us

                now...  Where should I go? 

                          EPPS

                I don't know. 

                          JAEGER 

                I've never been anywhere.  I wouldn't 

                know where to go.  Where would you go? 

                          EPPS 

                How the hell should I know? 

     Another long beat.  Still no car.

                          EPPS(CONT)

                Australia. 

                          JAEGER 

                What?

                          EPPS

                I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not 

                many people.  I think after this I'd like

                to quit people for awhile.  And the girls

                go crazy for brothers down there.

                          JAEGER

                Really? 

                          EPPS 

                That's what I hear.  Don't matter.  Girls

                go crazy everywhere for a man with gold. 

     From the distance we hear the faint sound of a car motor.  It

     draws closer and closer. 

     Epps and Jaeger stand.  Knowing they're so close to the end

     of a long adventure they become very business like.

                          JAEGER 

                Well, this is it.  We get the car, find 

                some Americans.  We find Americans we'll

                be all right. 

                          EPPS 

                We'll make up some kind of lie.  They

                won't find the gold. 

     Epps and Jaeger just stand staring at each other as the car

     draws closer. 

                          JAEGER

                Okay.  See you in a minute.

     Jaeger goes out and lays in the car's path.  Epps goes to

     hide behind some rocks.

     The car keeps getting closer and closer.

     Jaeger yells over to Epps. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)

                Epps, I don't think he's slowing down. 

                          EPPS 

                He'll slow down.

     The car gets closer. 

                          JAEGER

                He's not slowing. 

                          EPPS 

                He's going to slow down. 

     The car gets closer. 

                          JAEGER

                Epps...Epps! 

     The car barrels right for Jaeger.  Forget what Epps says,

     it's not slowing down and Jaeger knows it.

                          JAEGER(CONT)

                Aw, damn!

     At the last possible second Jaeger rolls out of the way.  The

     car doesn't slow, tearing across the stretch of road where

     Jaeger lay, but swerves to avoid him.  The DRIVER loses 

     control for a few seconds and is forced to skid to a halt.

     Epps runs to the car, rips open the driver's door, and

     presses the muzzle of an assault weapon to his head.

                          EPPS 

                You speak English?  DO YOU SPEAK

                ENGLISH!? 

                          DRIVER

                     (Frightened) 

                Y-yes. 

     Jaeger runs over and jumps in the car.  Epps gets in behind

     the driver, keeping the gun pressed to his head.

                          EPPS 

                Where were you going? 

                          DRIVER

                Baghdad. 

                          EPPS 

                What's in the other direction? 

                          DRIVER

                This road, it leads straight to Kuwait. 

                          EPPS 

                Turn the car around.

                          DRIVER 

                Please, I beg of you.  The American army

                is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill

                me. 

                          EPPS 

                Nobody's going to hurt you.

     Epps takes a gold coin from his back and gives it to the driver.

                          EPPS(CONT) 

                You see that?  Gold.  You take us to the

                Americans, and we'll give you another

                one.  Now drive. 

     The driver turns around the car and starts back in the

     direction he came. 

     They drive on for awhile, mostly in silence.  Epps and Jaeger

     are too anxious to have this all over to say much, and the

     driver is too scared.  Finally the driver starts to talk. 

                          DRIVER

                You are Americans, yes? 

     Neither Jaeger or Epps answer. 

                          DRIVER(CONT)

                We didn't not all want this war, do you

                know?  We didn't not all want to invade 

                our brothers and sisters in Kuwait.  Now

                your army crushes us.  So few days, and 

                so many have died.  And many fear we will

                all die.  Please tell this to your

                people:  We did not want this war.

     Still Jaeger and Epps say nothing.  Outside the car the 

     traffic flowing in the opposite direction gradually gets

     thicker and thicker.

                          DRIVER(CONT)

                I have a brother in our army.  When I 

                take you back, will you look for him?  If

                he is still alive, will you look for him

                and take care of him? 

     This last bit gets to Epps.

                          EPPS 

                Yeah.  We'll look for him.

     Outside the traffic away from Kuwait has gotten so thick 

     everything is at a stand still.  There are Iraqi military

     vehicles pulling out, as well as a good many civilian cars

     and trucks.  It clogs up both lanes, and envelopes the car.

     Some people try to make their way on foot as it is now much

     faster.

                          JAEGER

                Look at this.

                          DRIVER 

                Iraqis.  They are fleeing from Kuwait,

                from your military.

                          EPPS 

                See if you can't drive around this.

     The driver tries to work the car free of the congestion, but

     he's wedged in, and not going anywhere.

     From out of the sky swoop down a flight of AMERICAN F-15E

     FIGHTER JETS.  They swing down on the far end of the highway,

     engines roaring like angry lions.  For a second time stands

     still.  Everyone on the road stops and looks up at the jets.

     Time starts again, and with a deadly vengeance.

     The fighter pilots begin to strafe the highway:  Vehicles and

     people, civilian and military alike.  There is no

     distinction, only carnage.

     This is the infamous Al Jahra highway from Basrah to Kuwait

     City that was strafed with deadly accuracy over and over on

     the last day of the war by American forces.  It became known

     as the Highway of Death. 

     The huge shells rip a bloody path, shredding cars and trucks,

     igniting explosions, straight towards the car with Epps,

     Jaeger and the driver.  With barely seconds to go before they

     are shot to pieces as well.  They dive from the car, Epps

     dragging the driver out, and scramble for cover along the

     side of the road. 

     The planes turn back for another pass.

                          JAEGER 

                What the hell are they doing?  There're 

                civilians in there.

     Not even thinking about what he's doing Jaeger jumps up and

     screams at the jets.

                          JAEGER(CONT) 

                DON'T SHOOT!  DON'T SHOOT!  THEY'RE

                CIVILIANS! 

     Epps jumps up and drags Jaeger back down to cover as the

     shells fram the jets cut dangerously close to them. 

     The jets bank and swoop for another run.

     Epps realizes there is something wrong.  He looks around

     desperately, but doesn't see...THERE, BACK IN THE CAR! 

                          EPPS

                The gold! 

     Epps runs for the car, trying to beat the jets.

                          JAEGER

                No!

     Jaeger lunges for Epps but misses him.  Epps snakes his way

     through the burning hulks towards their car.  He dodges,

     jukes and weaves among shells, shrapnel and explosions that 

     go off all around him.  He just makes it to the car, grabbing

     up the gold, as the fighters once again swing low and cut

     loose. 

     A wicked hail of shells reigns down.  It sets off a series of

     violent explosions that knocks Jaeger off his feet.  It takes

     him a beat to recover.  By then the fighters have done their

     job, and fly off. 

     Jaeger stands.  He walks towards the road over the plaintive

     wails of the barely living.  The car, the gold, Epps... they

     are essentially disintegrated.

     AS THE CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP WE SEE THAT IT ISN'T JUST

     THEIR CAR AND EPPS THAT ARE GONE.  There isn't much of 

     anything left on this road.  Just death, destruction and

     bloodshed.

     INT. MILITARY COURTROOM - MONTHS LATER 

     Jaeger is cleaned up, in dress uniform, and sitting at a 

     table before a MILITARY TRIBUNAL.  He looks very sullen, as

     if this whole adventure has robbed him of his soul. 

     The members of the tribunal just look pissed. 

                          CHIEF JUSTICE 

                The members of this tribunal have reached

                a verdict.  Based on the evidence 

                presented we find the defended guilty as

                charged of desertion, insurrection, 

                insubordination, and conduct unbecoming.

                Further the tribunal will recommend that

                the defendant be sentenced to life 

                imprisonment, and that from this day 

                forward he shall no longer walk as a free

                man.  You should consider yourself quite

                fortunate, son.  There was a time when 

                lesser crimes would have found you before

                a firing squad.  I don't know that a 

                person like you has much to say for

                himself, but it is your right say

                something. 

     Jager doesn't stand.  He doesn't look at the tribunal.  He

     just begins to talk. 

                          JAEGER 

                I'm sorry, I guess.  Not for looking for

                the gold, or leaving my post.  You know

                what it's like to have gold raining out 

                of your hands?  That'll give me enough to

                think about the rest of my days in the 

                brig.  I'm just sorry about Wes.  He was

                all right.  It was the gold that made him

                what he became.  If I hadn't found that

                map, if I hadn't talked them into going 

                searching...Wes just might have made it

                home after all.  I guess I feel

                responsible for him. 

                          CHIEF JUSTICE

                The way I view things you're responsible

                for the lives of two men:  Private First 

                Class Wes Hanmond, and Second Lieutenant 

                John Epps. 

                          JAEGER 

                Yeah, well, I've been thinking about 

                that.  See, there was an explosion and 

                everything, but I never really aaw Epps 

                get killed.  And nobody ever found the

                gold.  I guess they both could have been 

                burned to slag.  I guess.  But there were

                a lot of bodies out on that road.  A

                smart man could have found some 

                identification to use.  A smart man could

                have made his way up to Syria or Turkey.

                A smart man could have gotten himself

                right out of the Middle East.  A smart

                man with enough gold.  Way I figure, 

                right about now old Epps is sitting in a

                bar in Sydney, or Melboure, or maybe 

                Brisbane telling stories to one of the

                prettiest Aussies you ever saw. 

     The members of the tribunal just scoff.

                          CHIEF JUSTICE 

                I find it highly unlikely that anyone

                could accomplish such a thing.

                          JAEGER 

                Well, Sir, I guess you don't know Second 

                Lieutenant John Epps very well, do you? 

     Jaeger allows himself a slight smile as he leaves the

     tribunal with this question. 

                                                           FADE TO:
