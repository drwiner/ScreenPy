                         CREDITS

          Credits start on a black screen, then they continue during the

          whole scene at Michelle's place, and they end at the beginning of

          the scene at Bill Capa's office.

          MICHELLE'S PLACE - INTERIOR DAY

          Close-up on a silver lipstick stand made into a bad taste musical

          box. We see Michelle's hand selecting a lipstick then we see

          Michelle putting the lipstick on her lips, seated in front of the

          mirror of her dressing table. She is dressed in a green frock, and

          her face shows that she is quite disturbed.

           Her apartment's decoration is very heavy, with a lot of various

          useless objects and gold-plated furniture and many mirrors.

           She looks for a new dress in her wardrobe, and get mad at not

          finding it. She then goes to a sofa covered with cushions, which

          she throws all around the place, still madder at not finding her

          dress. A cat, who was lying on the armrest of the sofa, runs away

          hurriedly from the mad Michelle.

                          MICHELLE

           God !...... No !......

          Michelle is back in front of the mirror of her dressing-table. She

          takes the lipstick and put a lot of it on her lips, then on her

          teeth, then all around her mouth. She makes faces to herself in

          the mirror. She seems more and more disturbed.

           She takes a chrome-plated revolver in her drawer, starts to put

          it in her purse, then takes it out, spins the cylinder of the

          revolver, and puts the revolver in her mouth, as if she wanted to

          kill herself. But instead, she starts sucking the barrel, while

          she strokes the revolver in a quite erotic way.

          BILL CAPA' OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY

          Large planes of ground glass. We hear, without understanding them,

          some voices and laughs. Then a male voice becomes more

          understandable...

                          BILL'S VOICE

           So who do you think is the enemy ?... No, no, give me a

           specific answer...

          ... then Michelle appears on the screen. She is dressed in a green

          suit, she is heavily made up, et she still seems very disturbed.

           The office is very chic and evidently belongs to a very rich New-

          York psycho-analyst. Beautiful and good taste furniture. Shelves

          with leather-bound books.

                          MICHELLE

           You are the goddamned enemy, Capa, you and this all tower

           of psycho-babble. You know what I hope ? That God gets real

           pissed off and He shrivels up your cock, so that it points

           straight down to Hell, where you belongs !...

          During this reply, Bill Capa has appeared on the screen. He is

          seated. He is wearing a long-sleeve shirt, a necktie, but no

          jacket. He laughs at Michelle's last sentence.

                          BILL

           OK... Michelle, so you will become His Avenging Angel, and

           swoop down to finish me off.

          He stands up.

                          MICHELLE

           Now, I finally get it : you're are like my ex-husband. You

           think that everything got to be either black or white

           because you got color-blind. But God is on my side now. He

           knows I'm not like you

                          BILL

           Well, we are pretty much the same, Michelle. We all do it.

                          MICHELLE

           We all do what ?

                          BILL

           Tend to view our lives as we were looking through a

           keyhole. I's a very limited view of the truth. So, we have

           to fill in the blanks. We invent things.

                          MICHELLE

           I don't know what you mean.

                          BILL

           You invent enemies to test your strength against. You

           invent gods to protect you from these enemies.

                          MICHELLE

          Cutting him.

           What a depressing view of life you have, that is such

           horse-shit !

                          BILL

           Who is the enemy ? One minute you have friends, the next

           moment they've slipped away. You leave here and I wonder

           who is Michelle really hating this week. I try to remember

           and I can't bring it to mind. Do you know why ?

                          MICHELLE

           No, why don't you tell me

                          BILL

           Take a look in the mirror, Michelle

                          MICHELLE

           Which mirror ?... This mirror ?...

                          BILL

           Any mirror. Tell me what you see.

                          MICHELLE

          We see Michelle as if we were watching her from behind the mirror.

           I see... I see your reflection over my shoulder... I see... there

           is nothing much that I really like... I think I prefer the

           view outside actually...

          During this last reply, Bill, standing up, is fidgeting with

          something on his desk. At Michelle's last words, he turns toward

          her, looking alarmed. But he doesn't have time to do prevent her

          from breaking through the glass pane and jumping outside. He yells

          Michelle twice.

          A STREET IN NEW-YORK - EXTERIOR DAY

          We see Michelle's body falling all the way down. Capa's office

          must be around the 25th floor. The body crashes on the street. A

          police horse, who was near the impact, rears up in fright. As if

          the asphalt were translucent, we see Michelle's body from

          underneath, with the blood flowing around it.

                          SEVERAL VOICES

           All right, get back there... Stay back !... Get back in your

           car... Stop it...

          BILL CAPA'S OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY

          We see Bill with tears in his eyes. He walks to the broken window,

          and look outside.

                          BILL

          Voice over.

           My God, it was the reddest blood I ever saw, poured around

           her green dress. And... Then the red disappeared...

          OPHTHALMOLOGIST'S OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY

          Bill is seated with a huge ophthalmologic device on his head. He

          finishes the preceding reply.

                          BILL

           Christ, Ed. It was like a vibration of color broadcast from

           Hell. And then the red started to fade away.

          The ophthalmologist moves the device away. We see Bill's face, and

          behind him, projected on the wall, an abstract drawing made of

          colored spots close together. The red spots start to blink and

          then they become grey.

          LARRY'S PLACE - INTERIOR DAY

          It is the apartment of an old New-York intellectual. A bit messy.

          A old Earth globe on a stand. Objects and books everywhere, but

          with an warm atmosphere. Larry wears an open shirt and a sweater.

          Bill also is in open shirt, with a sleeveless sweater. At the

          beginning of the scene, Bill is lying on a couch.

                          LARRY

           Poor Capa ! You're here for me to pity you.

          Larry puts down the newspaper he was reading. It is the New York

          Post. On the front page, a title in large prints : Patient's

          family sues Manhattan shrink

                          BILL

           Hell, yes. It doesn't take Sigmund Freud to figure out I

           don't care to see the color of my patients' blood.

                          LARRY

           I'm a little surprised that this happened to you.

                          BILL

           Starts to stand up.

           Sure. You always thought I was a cold-hearted son of a

           bitch.

                          LARRY

           Not really, but there is a kind of arrogance here.

          Bill laughs.

           Do you really believe that you're responsible for her

           illness. You were a small recent part of her life.

                          BILL

           Yes, that's right, that's right. But it's all too fucking

           glib for me, Larry. I cannot dispose of this woman that

           easily.

                          LARRY

           Well, you always were a romantic. Are you involved with

           anyone else ?

          Larry starts to make tea in a corner of the room. Bill is seated

          on an armchair during the following reply, and strokes the grey

          cat who is lying on the table.

                          BILL

           No. I am still a romantic. I just don't have anybody to be

           romantic with. They want to fuck me or marry me... None of

           them want to love me

                          LARRY

           Maybe you don't want to be loved. You had a happy marriage

           once.

                          BILL

           She loved me to death. Then she ran off and loved somebody

           else to death.

                          LARRY

           Of course, there is something else here. To deny red is to

           deny emotion.

                          BILL

           Oh yeah !

                          LARRY

           As you know, that could be very dangerous.

          Bill stands up.

                          BILL

           Yes, yes, I know. Very dangerous. I know and I have got

           something broken. I know it's gonna take some time to get

           fixed.

          He picks up his jacket on a chair and put it on.

                          LARRY

           You're a pretty good therapist. How long does it take a man

           like you to forgive himself.

                          BILL

           I see you when I get back from Los Angeles.

          During the two last replies, Bill has walked to the front door.

                          LARRY

           Don't run away because of one treatment failure.

                          BILL

           I'm not running away, Larry, it's just a little trip to Los

           Angeles. Besides, you can't really run away. It's all up

           here, isn't it...

          He shows his forehead and pretends he is shooting a bullet in it.

           Pow !... It's a package deal. The head goes with me.

          ABOVE L.A. - EXTERIOR DAY

          Shot of L.A. seen from the sky, then shot of an airplane landing.

          On these two short shots, we hear :

                          STEWARDESS

           Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Los Angeles. Please remain

           seated until the aircraft comes...

          The end of the sentence is not understandable, because it is mixed

          with the sound of a radio set in a car.

           VOICE IN THE RADIO

           Just another Monday in paradise. There is a fender-bender

           on 405, slowing thing down.

          TAXI IN A TRAFFIC JAM - EXTERIOR DAY

          The voice in the radio is covered by the voice of the taxi driver.

          He wears a French cap and a striped shirt. He has a strong foreign

          accent, which makes his sentences a bit hard to understand. Bill

          is seated at the back of the taxi. He is wearing a black polo

          shirt, jeans and sunglasses.

                          TAXI DRIVER

           Hey ! Jerk-off ! What are you looking at ! There's an

           accident !...

          Short shot of the accident.

           ... Hey ! What happened ? Anybody is hurt ? Anybody is dead ?

          Car horns. A car bumps into the back of the taxi. Bill moves

          forward and backward, and then massages the back of his head.

           What are you doing ? You 're looking there and driving

           here ? Put the pedal on the metal... Asshole !

          BOB'S OFFICE - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Bob's office is located in a big modern building in downtown L.A.

          A wide sitting room, called Group Room is reserved for group

          therapy sessions. Furniture is modern and functional, but with a

          little personal touch.

           Close-up of a woman's hand, who steals a lighter on a table. Then

          we see Sondra putting covertly the lighter in her purse. She is

          dressed in a very elegant way, and wears expensive jewels. Richie,

          a teenagers with a large checkered floating shirt, a sleeveless

          denim jacket and walkman earphones on his head, walks behind her

          without looking at her, and gets seated in an armchair. We hear

          voices, but we understand only a few words here and there. Then a

          voice becomes clearer than the other ones. It is Clark's voice

          counting the books on a shelf.

           BITS OF CONVERSATION

           Is the aquarium with it ?... That's a blue shark... OK... Was

           that an after-schock I felt ?...

                          CLARK

          He is dressed with a very neat grey suit. Everything on him is

          neat : not a hair going the wrong way.

           33 and 3 is... 44... 45

                          CASEY

          He is seated on an armchair shaped like a giant hand. He looks ver

          artist. He wears his hair tied in a ponytail. He is making fun

          of Clark.

           5...

                          CLARK

           38... 14...

           13...

           3...

                          CASEY

           29... 304...

                          SONDRA

           Casey, you're such a weenie !

                          BUCK

          He looks very rough, with his uncombed grey hair. He wears a red

          sweater without shirt, and a jacket.

           Leave him alone, will you ?

                          CLARK

                          7

                          BUCK

           Clark !

                          CASEY

           8...

                          BUCK

           Clark !

                          CLARK

           Yeah !

                          BUCK

           Did you read the paper to-day ?

                          CLARK

           No !

                          BUCK

          He take off his jacket.

           I was just wondering how many fucking pages it had !

          Casey laughs.

                          CLARK

           Oh Christ ! I fell right into that !

          We see Bob behind the glass on the door of the room. He wears a

          shirt and a necktie, but no jacket. He looks pensively at the

          group.

                          CASEY

           16...

                          CLARK

           4... 47...

                          BUCK

           I care that he is late.

                          CASEY

           I don't get it.

                          SONDRA

           I do too.

                          CASEY

           I don't care.

                          SONDRA

           Why not ?

                          BUCK

           Because his father's paying for his therapy.

                          SONDRA

           Oh, my dead husband is paying for mine, and I still care.

          Casey is looking for his lighter. We see Sondra taping her chin

          with the lighter, then giving it back to Casey.

                          CASEY

           Unbelievable !...

          Bob enters the room.

                          BOB

           I think we should get started now... Clark...

          He closes the door. We hear Bill's voice.

                          BILL

           Hey Bob !

                          BOB

           God ! Bill !

          BOB'S OFFICE - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR DAY

          Bob jumps nervously, then walks in the corridor toward Bill. They

          hug each other.

                          BOB

           How you doing ? You look great.

                          BILL

           I'm good...

                          BOB

           OK...

                          BILL

           I' sorry I'm late. I got stuck in traffic on the freeway.

                          BOB

           Listen... We're just about to get started.

                          BILL

           You know. I'll just wait out here for a while.

                          BOB

           Why don't you join us ?

                          BILL

           Oh no... Listen... I's the last thing I need right now...

                          BOB

           I'm serious... I could use a second look.

                          BILL

           No, Bob... Not tonight...

          Bob drags him by the sleeve and pushes him into the meeting room.

          BOB' OFFICE - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                          BOB

           This is my friend, and colleague, Bill Capa, from New-York.

           Why don't you sit down over there, Bill...

          He sits next to Clark, who stands up to give him room.

           ... I thought it might be interesting for you, and for him,

           if he sat in one of our session.

                          BUCK

           What kind of a shrink are you ?

                          BILL

           I'm a behaviorist.

                          CASEY

           Qualifications ?

                          BILL

           Same as Bob. We went to college together. We fought the

           battle at Penn State Mental Hospital, as interns...

                          BOB

           No one is gonna be offended if you want to say no.

                          BUCK

           No, Bob !

                          SONDRA

          She simpers while she talks.

           Nobod... Nobody wants to say no... I'm Sondra... How are you,

           Bill ?

                          BILL

           Fine, thank you, Sondra.

                          CLARK

           Medical degree ?

                          BILL

           No. I'm a psychologist and a psycho-analyst, not a

           psychiatrist. The Ph.D. is from N.Y.U.

                          CLARK

           OK ! Thank you...

                          CASEY

           So, it's Bill and Bob, therapy "a deux" !

                          BOB

           Why don't we begin by introducing ourselves and then saying

           as much or as little about why we are here as we are

           confortable with...

          The secretary closes the door behind Bob's back, who remains

          seated and only turns his head slightly.

                          BUCK

           Name's Buck.

                          SONDRA

           Oh, that's helpful. Very macho of you

                          BUCK

           That's an anti-gender remark

                          BOB

           Sondra ! Sondra, whey don't you start us off ?

                          SONDRA

          She simpers a lot and makes strange faces while she talks.

           OK... My name is Sondra Dorio... and... I always marry older men

           but...

          Richie looks at Bill's feet. Bill is wearing a red sock and a

          green sock, which makes Richie smile.

           ... I am single now... and I keep... I... I want sex all the time...

          Clark looks embarrassed. Casey sneers.

           But I mean... I really do... want... a real relationship... and...

           sometimes, I steal thing... I mean, they're little thing...

          Richie put his walkman earphones back on his ears.

           ... It doesn't make any sense. It's hard to... You know, I... Is

           that OK !

                          BOB

           Thank you.

                          SONDRA

                          THANKS

                          BOB

           Richie !...

                          CASEY

           This will be an event

                          BOB

           Richie !

          Richie doesn't hear a thing because of his earphones.

                          BUCK

          Yelling louder.

           Richie !

          He signals him to take off his earphones. Richie takes them off.

                          RICHIE

           What !

                          BOB

           Would you like to tell Bill a little something about

           yourself ?

                          RICHIE

           No !

                          CLARK

           OK... If nobody else is going to do it, I will. Richie has a

           gender identity problem, and social phobia, and he's

           promised the group no to wear the walkman in this group.

                          BUCK

           Doctor Clark, to lay the inventory on. I like that.

                          CLARK

           Oh, Saint Christopher rattles his chain.

                          BUCK

           Saint Michael, sir.

                          CLARK

           This is not about you.

                          BUCK

           You're right...

                          BOB

           You know what I am saying ?...

          He talks to Richie.

                          RICHIE

          One feels he has elocution problems. He stutters and looks for his

          words.

           I... I... I op... open my mouth to talk, but nothing... happens...

           except when I... when I do drugs. I... I can't... can't talk... so

           that's... how come I'm here... They... they say that I... I... that I

           blush too.

                          CASEY

          Imitating him.

           Y-You c... can say that again...

          Richie jumps on Casey. Sondra stands up to stop him, but she is

          toot late. Richie falls on Casey and knocks his armchair down.

                          RICHIE

           Fuck you !... Fuck you !... I'll tear your fuckin' head off !

           You fuckin' cocksucker !

                          BUCK

           Get up!

          They fight on the floor. Buck tries to take them apart. He

          succeeds in tearing Richie away by holding him with both arms, and

          carrying him away.

                          RICHIE

           Get the fuck off me !

                          BOB

           Buck.

          Richie gets free and walks rapidly out of the room. Sondra tries

          to follow him. Bob stops her.

                          SONDRA

           Richie !

                          BOB

           It's all right... He'll come back...

                          BUCK

          Voice over.

           What do you think, Doctor Clark ?...

          Bob straightens up the armchair and Casey stands up sneering.

                          CASEY

           Was it something I said ?

                          SONDRA

           You are an asshole !

                          BOB

           You know, guys... A little humanity...

                          BUCK

          Talking to Bill.

           Funny... Oh, fucking laugh !...We're entertaining the shit out

           of you, aren't we ?

                          SONDRA

           Why don't you stop feeling responsible for everyone.

                          BUCK

           Would you stop wound-licking, Sondra.

                          SONDRA

          She seems a bit shocked.

           Oh ! That's very nice !

                          BOB

           Buck ?

                          BUCK

           I lost my wife... and daughter... And it just can't seem to

           pass... All right ?

                          BILL

           Very sorry. How did they die ?

                          BUCK

           They say...

          He starts crying.

           ... I... I can't talk about it...

          Sondra turns her head away : she looks disturbed and moved. Clark

          wipes his eyes.

                          BOB

           Casey ?

                          CASEY

          He talks in articulating his words in an affected manner.

           I am Casey Heinz. I am a painter. I live in a loft

           downtown, and I guess... you could say... I'm alienated...

          At the end of his reply, he seems to be ready to cry. He puts his

          head in his hands, then shows his laughing face.

                          SONDRA

           Can't you ever be serious ?...

                          BUCK

           Does a bear poop in the woods ? I sit next to Clark

          He moves to sit behind Clark. He lights a cigarette.

                          CLARK

           And then smoke up a storm. My name is Clark. I'm a lawyer.

           And I... I have a compulsive obsessive disorder.

                          CASEY

           So what's the problem ?

          He sneers.

                          CLARK

           The problem is that if you and Buck are going to smoke in

           here, then the door to Doctor Moore's office must remain

           opened in minimum of fifteen inches.

          Buck comes and sits next to Casey. They smoke together.

                          SONDRA

           I can't stand smoke... OK ?

          Buck and Casey puff clouds of smoke.

                          CLARK

           And I would also like to suggest that you buy one of those

           ashtrays...

                          SONDRA

           How come you don't listen to Clark ? How come you don't do

           anything about this, Bob ?

                          CLARK

           ... that sucks up the smoke and purifies it. They cost nine

           dollars and ninety-nine cents, half of which is four-

           ninety-nine point five.

                          CASEY

                         HE LAUGHS

           He's going to open the door.

                          CLARK

           One of you will have to pay an extra penny, but I'm sure

           you can work that out.

                          CASEY

           He's going to open the door.

                          CLARK

           I'm going to open the door.

          General laugh. Several incomprehensible words. We understand only

          Sondra's next reply.

                          SONDRA

           You smell like an ashtray.

                          CLARK

           You know, if you don't act more seriously in groups.

          Richie enters the room.

                          SONDRA

           Hi, Richie !

                          BUCK

           He's back.

                          CASEY

           He's back.

                          BUCK

           Next time you get snot on the doorknob...

                          SONDRA

           Come sit down here.

                          BOB

           Bill... What would you like to tell us about yourself ?

          Richie walks behind Bill to reach his seat.

                          BILL

           Well... I have plenty of problems... the biggest of which right

           now is jet-lag. So I think I'll pass for now, Bob.

                          BOB

           Fair enough...

          BOB' OFFICE - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          The end of the preceding scene fades in the beginning of this one.

          We are now later in the same day. Night has come. The atmosphere

          seems more relax. Buck is half lying on a sofa. Sondra is

          finishing her story with a sweet voice, and does not simper

          anymore.

                          SONDRA

           ...She's like a daughter to me... We hang out... Meaning that...

           It's wonderful...

                          BOB

          He looks at this watch.

           Well, that's all for tonight. I'll see you all next week...

                          BUCK

           Way to go.

          Bob gets up very quickly. Everyone does like him, but more slowly.

          Bob turns back before he leaves the room.

                          BOB

           Bill... I'll be with you in a couple of minutes.

          Bill nods in agreement.

                          SONDRA

           Bye...

                          BUCK

           Coffee, anyone?

                          BILL

           Yeah.

                          CLARK

          He whispers.

           Nine.

          Bill remains seated and nods to the people getting out. Clark

          remains, behind Bill, in front of the shelves. He puts something

          back in a plastic bag and mumbles something we don't understand.

          Bill turns toward him.

                          CLARK

           Have you read Bob's book ?

                          BILL

           No, I haven't.

                          CLARK

          He puts the bag in the pocket of this jacket, and takes a book on

          a shelf. He gives it to Bill.

           It's really... it's quite excellent.

                          BILL

           "Way to go"... I'm glad to hear you liked it.

                          CLARK

          He wipes his hand with a white handkerchief, wipes the handle of

          his black leather case before taking it, and then puts the

          handkerchief in the pocket of his pants.

           Very much. Good night, Doctor Capa.

                          BILL

          Bill holds his hand out, but Clark does not take it. He just nods

          in a friendly way and goes out.

           Good night.

          Alone, Bill flips through the books.

          IN FRONT OF BOB'S OFFICE BUILDING - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          Bill and Bob come out of the building where Bob's office is

          located. Bob has his jacket on and Bob is wearing a brown leather

          jacket. He is carrying his traveling bags.

                          BILL

           Alone at last !...

                          BOB

           Are you OK ?

                          BILL

           Well, nobody jumped out of the window. So maybe I am making

           progress...

          BOB'S CAR - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          Bob's expensive convertible Mercedes starts away. On the back

          license plate, we can read WAY TO GO. The roof of the car is

          open. The rest of the scene takes place inside the car driving

          through Los Angeles.

                          BOB

           You want to get a drink ?

                          BILL

           Hu-hu !

                          BOB

           You want to get laid ?

                          BILL

          He laughs.

           No !

                          BOB

           So what do you think of my little group ?

                          BILL

           What's Buck's story ?

                          BOB

           You mean, how did he loose his wife and kid. I don't know

           yet. He's not talking yet... Either !

                          BILL

           How about Casey ?

                          BOB

           You tell me !

                          BILL

           Well... I smell money... Lots of it... Maybe an abusive father...

           How am I doing so far ?

                          BOB

           A Plus !

                          BILL

           Daddy pays for the expensive loft downtown, and the very

           expensive artistic life style, as long a junior stays in

           therapy.

                          BOB

           You got the hair on the back of my neck standing up !

                          BILL

           Yes, I'm a psychic when it comes to masochists. Five'll get

           you ten he likes to whack now and then.

                          BOB

           Where did you get that from ?

                          BILL

           I was born with it. Like a tuning fork.

                          BOB

           What about Richie ?

                          BILL

           Genuine nut-case.

                          BOB

           Dangerous ?

                          BILL

           Volatile ! Don't fuck with a trapped rat !

                          BOB

           Oh, I see. "Trapped rat" syndrome with a recommendation of

           a "Non fuck with" therapy !

          Bill laughs.

           Well, can I quote you on that ?

          They have reached a quieter road.

                          BILL

           Yes, you may. Takes notes, there'll be a pop-quiz later !...

                          BOB

           OK, I'm ready.

          Bob turns on his left to enter his residence.

                          BILL

           All right, if I diagnose a schizophrenia, what do you

           recommend ?

                          BOB

           Don't fuck with it !

                          BILL

           Now, you got it.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          A huge sliding metallic door, with spikes on the top, moves

          smoothly to let the car enter. Bill seems impressed by the

          residence of his friend. He looks at the security camera. Bob

          stops the car and they get out of it. Bill takes his luggage.

                          BILL

           It's all one place ?...

          They come near a door shaped like a giant keyhole.

           Goddamn...

          A metallic gate slides behind the door to let them in.

           Like peeking through a keyhole...

          They get down a few steps and reach a lawn.

           You get a very limited... view of the truth....

                          BOB

           What's that ?

          Bill looks with admiration at the pool, and at the huge and

          impressive house, very Hollywood-like.

                          BILL

           "Way to go" must have gone really well !

                          BOB

           Yeah !

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - INTERIOR NIGHT

          They enter the house. A beep is heard when Bob opens the door.

                          BOB

           After you, wise guy... Come on.

          Bill laughs.

                          BILL

           Oh, men...

          He laughs, looking at the luxury that surrounds him. The best and

          the most expensive in modern furniture. Large expensive paintings

          hanged on the walls. Leather armchairs. Bob types a secret code on

          a keyboard. Then he switch on a small TV set that shows the

          pictures from all the security cameras.

           So, how are we as we approach forty ?

                          BOB

           We are in a good shape. Really good shape. We finally got

           divorced. We have some money...

          He puts back in place a painting that was slightly crooked.

           ... We're meticulous.

                          BILL

          He takes off his jacket.

           I don't detect a woman's touch.

                          BOB

           We have a little friend... You'll meet her.

                          BILL

           She's too young for you.

                          BOB

           Ohh !

                          BILL

          He sits behind the bar.

           Always get the cliches and you won't be disappointed.

                          BOB

           This woman is not a cliche.

          He has taken two bottle of beer from the fridge and he gives one

          to Bill.

                          BILL

           Thanks...

          They clink the two bottle and drink the beer from the bottle.

           Good to see you, Bob !

                          BOB

           You too !... So...

          Bill plays with a piece of art, consisting of an assembly of

          square pieces of glass glued together into a larger square. The

          object can pivot on his stand and, when you look through it, you

          get a distorted view of whatever is behind it.

           You're ready yet ?

                          BILL

           Ready to what ?

          We see the distorted face of Bill through the piece of art, or

          rather several distorted view of Bill's face seen through each of

          the individual square of glass. Bob pivot the object to have a

          better view of his friend.

           So hard to talk about... So hard to talk about...

          Bill pivot the object again to hide behind it.

           I's just a game... dumb, deceitful game. So I quit my

           practice.

          He gets up.

                          BOB

           Lost you religion, huh ?

                          BILL

          He takes a big book on a shelf. There is a picture of Sigmund

          Freud on the cover.

           Well, I certainly lost my belief in the scriptures.

          He puts the book back, and with his hand, makes a masturbation

          gesture.

                          BOB

           I'm sorry, buddy. You gonna be in a lot of pain.

                          BILL

           There is a distinctive absence of pain. I... I cannot feel

           the pain that I know that I'm supposed to be feeling right

           now. And I think I'm going crazy...

          We feel that Bill is ready to cry.

           I'm lost, man, I think I'm going crazy.

          He has tears in his eyes.

                          BOB

           You may be... Your mind may be shot...

          COUNTRYSIDE - EXTERIOR DAY

          In front of Bob's residence. The sun is shining. Bill is wearing a

          brown tank top and white jogging pants. Bob is wearing a blue

          cyclist shirt and black pants. They're both wearing caps. They are

          ready to go cycling. We hear the voice over of Bob, finishing the

          sentence from the preceding scene.

                          BOB

           ... but I hope your body isn't.

                          BILL

           Do I get to warm up ?

                          BOB

           Yeah !... Two mile any pace you like. And then...

          They mount their bicycles.

           ... let's do ten.

          They are now on the road in front of Bob's residence.

                          BILL

           Ten ?

                          BOB

           Too much for you, huh ?

                          BILL

           I dunno... I was thinking of maybe twenty.

          He starts full speed.

           They are now on a minor dirt road. We can see Bob's house in the

          background.

                          BOB

           Gees ! Billy ! You'll never change... Why don't we just drop

           our pants to see who's got the bigger dick, and then we can

           go back and have a nice civilized breakfast ?

                          BILL

           Wouldn't be civilized...

                          BOB

           Why ?

                          BILL

           You'll be sulking !

                          BOB

          They are going uphill.

           You don't have hills in New-York...

          He slows down.

           Hang on a second... Hang on a second... Hang on a second...

          Bob stops and dismounts his bike.

                          BILL

           What ?

                          BOB

           What was that ?... What the hell was that ?...

          Bill dismounts his bike. Bob gets his bike upside down and sets it

          upright standing on the saddle and the handlebar. He checks the

          chain. Bill is leaning on his bike.

                          BILL

           What are you afraid of ?

                          BOB

           I got a gear slip, here somewhere...

                          BILL

           That's not what I meant... What with the security systems,

           the security gates, looking over your shoulder.

                          BOB

           I've been getting some threats.

                          BILL

           What do you mean ?... Death threats ?

                          BOB

           Pretty sure it's somebody in the Monday night group, I just

           don't know who...

                          BILL

           Monday night as in last night ?

                          BOB

           Yeah !... I was hoping that maybe with your tuning fork that

           you might have a hunch.

                          BILL

           No... No hunch, Bob. What make you think it's somebody in the

           group ?

          Bob spins the pedals to check the chain.

                          BOB

           Only about a dozen things... I's been going on for a couple

           of months now. It's funny how it gets you after a while.

                          BILL

           Call the cops ?...

                          BOB

          He puts his bike back on the wheels.

           Yeah ! They say if they had to protect every shrink in

           L.A., they'll need an army ! But that I should call them if

           anything happened.

          They put their sunglasses on.

                          BILL

          He laughs.

           That makes sense.

                          BOB

           Yeah ! Probably, it'll just blow over.

                          BILL

           Yeah !

                          BOB

           How about you ?

                          BILL

           About me... what ?

          We see them going very fast on the minor dirt road. A horse rider

          rides near them.

           What would you give a suicidal patient that's got

           everything ?

          They ride even faster while clowning, like riding on the back

          wheel.

                          BOB

           Parachute, I heard it already.

                          BILL

           Out here already, huh ?

                          BOB

           Come on, old timer !...

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY

          The heavy metal door is sliding away. Bob and Bill are getting in.

          They dismount their bikes with some difficulty. They drop their

          bikes on the ground.

                          BILL

           Oh, shit ! You may have to... You may have to carry me in.

          They hold each other by the waist and the shoulders.

                          BOB

           You know you lose a lot more gracefully than you used to...

                          BILL

           Yeah ! Well, you know... Practice and all... Hey ! How about

           that : "Learning to loose" by Doctor Bill Capa !

          A beep and the second gate gets open.

                          BOB

           Got a ring to it !

                          BILL

           They are making those seats smaller, huh ? Whoo !

          They enter the residence. Bill is massaging his buttocks.

          BOB'S OFFICE - BOB'S WORKROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Short low angle shot of the whole building, before entering Bob's

          workroom. Bob's desk is decorated with two wrought iron eagles.

          Bob is wearing jacket and necktie. He is just finishing a session

          with a patient.

                          BOB

           See you next week. All right ?

          He escorts his patient to the door. Enter Barbara, Bob's

          secretary.

                          BARBARA

           I'm going now. You want me to lock on the way out ?

                          BOB

           That'll be great, Barbara.

          She gets out. Bob takes his jacket off and sets it on a clothes

          valet. He then stops by the shelves behind his desk and starts the

          music : a concerto for piano and orchestra. He sits behind his

          desk, and starts writing in a large notebook. He hears a strange

          noise, and raises his head. He puts his pen down, open a drawer

          and takes his revolver out. A draught flips the pages of his

          notebook. He seems to feel better, puts the revolver back and

          closes the drawer. Then he closes the notebook, takes it and goes

          to the shelves. He seems to be looking for something, and feels

          worried not to find it. He gets out of his workroom.

          BOB'S OFFICE - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          He enters the meeting room and goes directly to the shelves. He

          looks around and takes an art book about Van Gogh. He checks that

          the size of the art book and the size of his notebook are similar.

          He takes off the dustcover of the art book and puts it on his

          notebook, puts his notebook on the shelf where the art book was

          and puts the art book in the bottom of the shelves. A shadow moves

          on the shelves and a strange noise is heard. Bob, a bit nervous,

          goes to the door and opens it. The classical music stops. Through

          the open door, we can see Bob opening the door of his workroom.

                          BOB

           Barbara ?...

          He comes back into the meeting room. When he enters the room, the

          light is suddenly switched off. He crosses the meeting room. We

          can hear someone chuckling, and we can see a shadow through the

          glass on the door.

          BOB'S OFFICE - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Bobs gets rapidly out of the meeting room. A man, completely

          covered in black leather, jumps through a large ground glass

          paneI, and jumps on Bob's back. Short fight on the floor. Bob gets

          up, bumps into the drinking fountain which falls on the floor, and

          falls down.

           Close-up of the mysterious man's hand. It is covered with a

          glove. The hand closes itself and a long blade appears on the top

          of the hand. Bob gets up and is stabbed in the chest. He staggers

          a bit, takes a blue vase on a table and tries to hit the head of

          the mysterious man. He misses and the vase crashes on the wall. He

          is stabbed again in the chest. His staggering increases. He turns

          around and the man stabs him several time in the back. He stumbles

          to the front door. Another stab in the back. The man grabs him by

          his hair to bring him back into the workroom.

                          BOB

           No... Nooooo !... Why ?

          The man stabs him several times. Bob is covered with blood. He

          falls on a glass door. The glass is shattered. Bob falls on his

          back. A big piece of glass goes through him and comes out of his

          stomach. Through the window, we can see an helicopter flying over

          Los Angeles.

          MAIN POLICE STATION - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          A car has just stopped in front of the building. The blue

          revolving light keeps on moving on top of the car. An helicopter

          is flying above the building. It could be the same that is seen at

          the end of the preceding scene. Officer Anderson goes around the

          car and opens the door for Bill. Bill is wearing a T-shirt, a

          light sweater and jeans. One can tell he had to dress quickly.

          Bills gets out of the car, and the car moves away. Anderson takes

          Bill into the building.

          MAIN POLICE STATION - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Classical setup of a californian police station. The various rooms

          are separated with glass partitions. An officer enters pushing, in

          front of him, a hooker dressed with a minimum of very flashy

          clothes.

           VOICE OF A POLICE WOMAN

           Have you thought about...

                          THE HOOKER

           Man, I didn't do nothing. Oh, please... You know, you're very

           cute. I love you.

           THE POLICE OFFICER

           I love you too !

          Anderson leads Bill into a room and leaves him there. Bill sits

          down. Enters lieutenant Hector Martinez. He is wearing a pink

          shirt with short sleeves. His tie is badly knotted on an open

          collar. He has a police badge fixed on his belt. He holds a file

          in his hand.

                          HECTOR

           You're Capa ?

                          BILL

           Yes, I'm Doctor Capa.

                          HECTOR

          He closes the door, puts his file on the desk and sits down behind

          the desk.

           You're here because of the dead doctor ?

                          BILL

           Yes...

                          HECTOR

           I read something about sessions on Mondays. Tell me about

           this Monday group.

                          BILL

           There's five patients in the group. I Can't really remember

           their names right now.

                          HECTOR

          He taps his head with his right hand, a gesture meaning mental

          illness. He has a telephone number scribbled on the palm of his

          hand.

           Like five cuckoos.

                          BILL

           No. Four neurotics of varying degrees and one killer. At

           least, that's what Bob thought.

                          HECTOR

           Bob Moore ?

                          BILL

           Good. Yes, Bob Moore.

                          HECTOR

           Four men and one woman.

                          BILL

           Right.

                          HECTOR

           And you sat in one of these sessions, right ?

                          BILL

           Yes, I did.

                          HECTOR

           So, who did it ?

          Anderson enters the room behind Bill, carrying a plastic cup.

           Hey-hey-hey-hey... ! Anderson ! This is civilization, man.

           What do think this is ?... Your bedroom ?...

          Anderson gives Bill the cup.

           Damn... Knock... Knock... Don't... don't come into my office like

           that, bro. Hey !

          Anderson leaves the room and closes the door.

           It's third world thing !... Where were we ?...

                          BILL

          He blows on the cup.

           You were probing me about the patients. And I was about to

           tell you that I really can't help you at all. I don't

           really know any of these people.

                          HECTOR

           But you're a professional like me. You gotta have some kind

           of suspicion.

                          BILL

           I really don't have a clue. I'd like to help you, but even

           if I could, there is an issue of confidentiality.

                          HECTOR

           Confidentiality ?...

                          BILL

           Yes.

                          HECTOR

          He laughs and gets up.

           You're talking to me about an issue of confidentiality.

                          BILL

           Similar to the Miranda oath.

                          HECTOR

          He sits down on the desk, facing Bill.

           If a friend of mine got killed, and the only thing between

           the killer and me was Miranda, you know what I will do ?...

           Huh ?... Fuck Miranda up the ass. But don't tell anybody,

           because it's a matter of confidentiality... Shhh !...

          He puts a finger on his lips.

                          BILL

           Oh, look ! I'm sorry I can't help you. I've only been in

           Los Angeles four days.

                          HECTOR

           You're sleeping at that... dead guy's house, aren't you ?

                          BILL

           Yes.

                          HECTOR

           Maybe something will come to you in the night, you know,

           like dreams and shit. But... what happens to patients in a

           situation like this ?

                          BILL

           Usually a colleague will offer to take over the group...

           continue the treatment.

                          HECTOR

          He gets up. We see his pistol hooked on the back of his belt.

           How sweet !... How sweet !... It's like one of the vultures

           dies and then the others step in line and eat his portion.

          He mimes vultures walking.

           Is that what you're planning ?

                          BILL

           No.

                          HECTOR

           Why not ?

                          BILL

           Because I really can't handle that right now.

                          HECTOR

           Sure you can !... Come on !... You've been a week in L.A. and

           you already have you own private screwing farm.

          He sits back on the edge of the desk.

           How bad can that be ?... That's a great career move.... Where

           were you at the time of the killing, Capa ?

                          BILL

          He pauses before answering.

           I was at his house, Bob's house.

                          HECTOR

           You had to think about that ?

                          BILL

           Jesus Christ !... Are you going to arrest me, Lieutenant

           Martinez ?

                          HECTOR

           Hey ! You want a lawyer ?

                          BILL

           Do I need a lawyer ?

                          HECTOR

           You're in L.A. Everybody needs a lawyer.

          He goes back to his seat behind the desk, and conspicuously shows

          his back to Bill.

           All right !... You can go home now, take a shower.

          He turns back to Bill.

           And keep your mouth shut. The only thing that I got going

           for me is that few people know what happened, and I don't

           want the press fucking things up.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Bill plays with the piece of art made of pieces of glass. He

          pivots it. We can see Bill's face duplicated by the object. We

          then see Bill putting back in place the same crooked painting that

          Bob had been putting back in place the first time Bill was in the

          house. Then we see him walking pensively around the house.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - INTERIOR DAY

          A corridor. We hear the buzz of an intercom. Bill comes out of the

          bathroom, dressed in a white bathrobe. He is drying his hair with

          a towel.

                          BILL

           All right !... All right !... Hold on !

          He walks in the corridor, looking for the buzzer. He arrives into

          the main hall, near the video security device. On the wall near

          the TV set, two large paintings showing enlarged footprints. On

          the screen, we see Hector's face.

                          BILL

           Oh shit !

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - MAIN GATE - EXTERIOR DAY

          Hector is waiting in front of the gate. He is wearing a grey

          shirt, a beige blazer and a necktie, and a police badge on his

          belt. Next to him is Bob's car. Behind him, a uniformed police

          officer. Hector presses the bell. We hear a beep.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - HALL - INTERIOR DAY

          We see and hear Hector via the TV set.

                          HECTOR

           Capa !... Capa !... Are you there ?

          Bill takes the remote control.

                          BILL

           Yeah...

                          HECTOR

           How is it going ?

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - MAIN GATE - EXTERIOR DAY

          We hear Bill's voice in the intercom.

                          BILL

           What do you want ?

                          HECTOR

           I brought the victim's car back and I got to search the

           house.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - HALL - INTERIOR DAY

                          BILL

           You got a search warrant ?

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - MAIN GATE - EXTERIOR DAY

                          HECTOR

           What is it with you ? Don't you want me to find out who

           killed your friend ?... No, I don't have a warrant.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - HALL - INTERIOR DAY

                          BILL

           All right... Come on in...

                          HECTOR

           Open the gate.

                          BILL

           Yeah... Right... How's that ?

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - MAIN GATE - EXTERIOR DAY

          Hector waits a little, then gets sprayed by a sprinkler located

          outside the screen-field.

                          HECTOR

           You got the sprinklers on !

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - HALL - INTERIOR DAY

          We hears the end of Hector's sentence.

                          BILL

           How about that ?

          Bill taps on the remote control. We hear a beep. On the TV set, we

          see Hector taking his jacket off.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Hector is searching the shelves on the wall. He quickly looks

          through the books, takes a step back, then thrusts his hand behind

          a row of books, and grabs a photo album. While flipping through

          the pages, he goes to the sofa and sits next to Bill. Bill is

          wearing a white shirt and a pair of jeans. Hector goes on turning

          the pages, and stop on a page with the picture of supine naked

          woman.

                          BILL

           Jill... his wife... his ex-wife...

                          HECTOR

           Nice bush !

          Bill closes the album, takes it from Hector's hands and gets up.

          He turns to look at Hector.

                          BILL

           I'll tell you said so...

          He walks to the shelves and put the album back where it was found.

          He looks at Hector.

           I'm sure it will mean a lot to her...

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Close-up of the head of the bed. It is decorated with wooden

          sculpture of women's faces. Hector enters the room, followed by

          Bill. He goes to the bed and strokes the sculptures.

                          HECTOR

           Check this fucking bed !

          He goes around the bed and sits next to the sculpture, which he

          keeps on fondling.

           Damn !... Everybody is having fun but me, goddammit !

          Hector opens a drawer, and takes a revolver out of it. He holds it

          with his pen stuck into the trigger ring.

                          BILL

           I do not like guns.

          Hector puts the revolver back in the drawer.

                          HECTOR

           You prefer knives ?

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY

          Bill and Hector are getting out of the house.

                          HECTOR

           I need you to do me a favor.

                          BILL

           What's that ?

          They are crossing the garden. Hector is still in shirtsleeves and

          has some papers in his hand.

                          HECTOR

           I want you to tell the group about Moore's death.

                          BILL

           Me ?...

                          HECTOR

           Yes.

                          BILL

           Why ?

                          HECTOR

           Well, maybe one of them won't come in, or maybe they will

           all come in, but then you would be able to spot something

           wrong.

                          BILL

           I just can't handle it right now... OK ?...

                          HECTOR

           I just had all the mess in his office cleaned up. Don't you

           want to help me find the killer ? Have a heart.

                          BILL

           What does that mean?

                          HECTOR

           If you don't tell them, I'll have to tell them. Am I the

           person to break the news to these people ?  Listen up, you

           fucking daffodils, your shrink is dead.

          They have reached the main gate. Hector gets out and Bill presses

          a switch. The gate starts sliding between him and Hector.

           Which means that all the time, effort and love you put in

           this relationship is wasted. You've got to remain as fucked

           up as you are or get worse. 

                          BILL

           You are one sinister piece of work. All right, I'll do it.

                          HECTOR

           It's better if you do it.

          A ROAD - EXTERIOR DAY

          We are in Bob's car, with the roof open. Bill is wearing a green

          polo shirt, jeans and sunglasses. He is on the phone, while he

          drives the car, but he drives slowly.

                          BILL

           No, you listen to me. You don't understand, Gene. Don't

           lie, just give the family what it wants... No... No, you don't

           understand.

          We see Bill from the back. In the rear-view mirror of the car, we

          see another convertible vehicle approaching with also its roof

          open. A young girl is driving. She comes a bit too fast and bumps

          into the back of Bill's car. Bill jumps and stops his car.

           I have to call you back. Christ !

          He puts the telephone back on his hook and gets out of the car. He

          goes to Rose's car. She is leaning on the steering wheel.

           Hey !... You're right ?... Hey !...

          He opens the door. She stands back. She is wearing a large beige

          sweater.

                          ROSE

           Why me ?... Hi !... I'm Rose.

                          BILL

           Hi, Rose !... I't nice to run into me like this !... I'm Bill

           Capa...

          He goes away from the car.

                          ROSE

           I got no insurance...

          She gets out of her car.

           I know it's against the law and everything.

          She goes around her car, and looks at the damage.

           Don't bust my chops. I'll bring the money to you, if you

           just get an estimate.

          She stoops, picks up a piece of red plastic and gives it to Bill.

           OK ?... Just give me a break !

                          BILL

           Got a pen ?

          Rose goes to her car and Bill throws the piece of red plastic

          away. Rose gets into her car, looks into her purse, and takes a

          small notebook and a pen. Bill takes them but hesitates before

          writing. Rose smiles mockingly.

                          ROSE

           Oh, poor old brain can't remember its own phone number.

                          BILL

           I just moved here... From New York... I wrote my address down,

           because I am not sure about this number, and how long I

           gonna be there, so maybe you can call me sometimes for the

           next couple of days.

                          ROSE

           I will.

                          BILL

           Bye !

          He goes away from the car.

                          ROSE

           Hey !... Don't you want my address ?

          Bill gets into his car.

                          BILL

           You could lie.

          He starts his car.

          BOB'S OFFICE - WORKROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Bill skip through the pages of a large notebook, looking exactly

          like the one Bob had hidden under a Van Gogh dustcover just before

          he got killed. He puts his back on the two other ones, already

          lying on the desk. He is wearing a grey T-shirt and an open denim

          shirt.

          BOB'S OFFICE - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Bill enters the room, coming from the workroom.

                          BILL

           Hi !... Who hasn't arrived yet ?

                          BUCK

          He is standing up. He is wearing a white T-shirt and a grey

          sweater with a V-shaped collar.

           Sondra... Where's Bob ?

                          RICHIE

          He is wearing a grey sport jacket with a zipper and a striped T-

          shirt.

           Wha... What's wrong ?

                          BILL

           If it's all right, I'd rather wait till you're all here.

           She's always this late ?

                          CLARK

          He is wearing a dark suit, very elegant. He is wiping his hand

          with a handkerchief.

           Depends on who is banging her...

                          SONDRA

          She enters very rapidly through the corridor door. She seems very

          happy. She drops on the armchair next to Casey. She is wearing an

          very close-fitting overall, which is generously open on her

          throat. The top of the overall is very colorful and the bottom is

          black. On top of it, she is wearing a pink sport jacket.

           Oh, I'm sorry... Class was really, really really late.

                          CASEY

          He is sitting in an armchair. He is wearing an grey collarless

          shirt and a black sleeveless vest.

           Was class was that, Sondra ? Advanced cunnilingus for the

           single woman, or a CPR for pleasure and game ?

                          BUCK

           Christ, don't excite her !...

                          SONDRA

           Where is Doctor Moore ?

                          BILL

           There's something I want to tell you.

                          RICHIE & CASEY

           What ?

                          SONDRA

           What's the matter ?

                          CASEY

           Shhhh !...

                          SONDRA

           I'm trying to pay attention... Shhh !

                          BILL

           You should prepare yourself for bad news...

                          SONDRA

           Why ?...

                          BILL

           Bob's been killed.

                          SONDRA

          Her face is distorted by the pain. She puts her hand in front of

          her mouth.

           Ohhhh !

                          CASEY

           What are you saying ?... What are you telling me ?

                          BILL

           He was murdered.

                          CASEY

           Sondra !...

                          BILL

           He was locking up here late Friday night.

                          SONDRA

           Here ?...

                          BILL

           Yes, right here in the office.

                          BUCK

           Was he shot... stabbed... beaten ?... Have they got a suspect... a

           motive ? Three days go by, and you don't call us.

                          BILL

           It was easier if you were here together.

                          CASEY

          He stands up.

           Oh, I see. So, even Bob's death is group therapy. That's

           great. Hey, Bob, thanks for giving us a chance to grieve

           together. Shit !...

          He gets more and more angry through the preceding reply.

                          BUCK

          He has become very nervous too.

           What the fuck is going on here ? I need to know more.

                          BILL

           He was stabbed to death.

                          CLARK

           How many times was he stabbed ?

                          SONDRA

          She jumps up. She goes to Clark and hits him.

           This man was Bob's best friend. Do you really needed exact

           numbers now ?

                          BILL

          He takes Sondra very gently by the shoulders and brings her back

          to her seat.

           Sondra... Sondra... Sondra... Sondra...

                          SONDRA

           Get your fucking hands off me...

                          BILL

           It's OK... It's OK !

                          CASEY

           It doesn't make sense to me...

                          BILL

           Many times, Clark... More than thirty... It's all I can tell

           you...

                          CASEY

           It wasn't a thief, I can tell you that right now.

                          CLARK

           I agree.

                          CASEY

          He is still very nervous.

           I mean, why stab a guy thirty times ?... Bob !... He'd piss in

           his pants if you showed him a knife, you know that...

                          SONDRA

          She is crying.

           What are you saying ?

                          CASEY

           I'm saying, Sondra, that you really, really have to hate a

           person to stab him that many times. You're a shrink,

           right ? You know what kind of power people hand over a

           shrink. Or maybe sometimes, they hand even more than they

           want to.

                          CLARK

           That is absolutely correct... A thief would not stick around

           and stab someone thirty times.

                          BUCK

          He sits down.

           Since when did you become such an expert on robbery ?

                          SONDRA

           It's not the robbery he's an expert on, it's the rage.

                          RICHIE

          He has seated himself behind Sondra and puts his hand on her

          shoulder.

           What... what are we gonna do now ? I mean u...us, th...the

           group ?

                          CASEY

           I bet Doctor Capa has an idea...

                          BUCK

           What does he mean ?

          Casey hits his forehead. Buck is almost crying.

                          BILL

          He sits down.

           I think Casey is suggesting that I... may have some plans to

           replace Bob...

          Casey sits down.

                          SONDRA

           Maybe you should.

                          BILL

           No... I can't do that... Not right now...

                          SONDRA

           Why ?...

                          BILL

           One reason is that I am more screwed up than you people

           are.

                          CASEY

           I was just being obnoxious, and loud before. Anybody has a

           fucking Xanax ?

                          SONDRA

           I have a librium...

                          BUCK

           Stop with the drugs.

                          CASEY

           It would be a good idea if you stayed.

                          BUCK

           Bob isn't cold yet ?

                          CASEY

           I mean, there'll be some connections. Right ?...

                          SONDRA

          She gets up and sits down in front of Bill. She takes the cushion

          which was on the armchair and hugs it.

           You were Bob's best friend... You... you seem kind of like him...

           I'll be so much easier to trust you.

                          BILL

          During the following reply, Richie comes and sits behind Sondra.

           I know what kind of force a group can become in your life...

           You tell things here... intimate things that... you wouldn't

           tell your best friend. I'm very flattered that you would...

          He stops. He seems ready to cry.

           But the truth is : You are the people that make this work.

           I would be more than happy to try to find someone for you

           to continue this, but I cannot help you.

                          CLARK

           If my opinion counts for anything, I would like to ask :

           why it is you feel so inadequate for the task.

          Buck comes and sits next to Clark.

                          BUCK

           Maybe he just don't like us.

                          BILL

           No, that's not it, Buck.

                          BUCK

           Why don't you step on something?

                          CLARK

           You stop.

                          BILL

           Six weeks ago, I spoke harshly to a patient. And she

           committed suicide... Right in front of me.

          Clark puts his handkerchief on his lips.

           Perhaps she would have done this, anyway. That's what my

           colleagues say... But I don't know...

                          SONDRA

           Oh, I'm sorry.

                          BILL

          He is crying with big tears.

           And my patient... Her name was Michelle... She jumped out... of a

           window in my office... Ohh... So much blood... And so red... And in

           right time, before my eyes... the red just disappeared... it's

           turned to grey... So I don't see... red now... Then I failed... so

           I can't help you... I don't think that you want someone like

           me around right now...

          Clark wipes his face again with his handkerchief. He seems to be

          extremely moved.

                          BUCK

           I think I do.

                          RICHIE

           M... me too.

                          CASEY

           Why don't you give us a try for a month.

                          CLARK

           Listen, if you need anything, any free legal advice, to

           help you wrap up Bob's affair, please don't hesitate to

           call me. I'm not with anyone right now. I'll be more than

           happy to help you in anyway.

          Clark gives his business card to Bill, who takes it. Then he gives

          him a kleenex. Bill wipes his eyes.

                          BILL

           Thank you.

          We see, through the window, light-beams crossing in the sky.

          THE WHISKY BAR - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          Usual atmosphere of a well-known bar. At a short distance from the

          entrance of the bar, a truck with two floodlights, the beams of

          which are sweeping the sky. Those beams make the connection with

          the preceding scene.

          THE WHISKY BAR - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Quick shot on the very noisy orchestra. A long hair bearded guy is

          playing the drums, a girl is playing the guitar. Bill, dressed

          exactly like in the preceding scene, is looking for someone.

          Eventually he founds him, Hector, who is already seated. Bill sits

          down at Hector's table. Hector is wearing an open dark pink shirt.

                          HECTOR

           You bring me a confession ?

                          BILL

           No.

                          HECTOR

           Well, you win some, you lose some, right Capa ?

                          BILL

           Listen, maybe it was not one of the group

                          HECTOR

           Oh no... he's beginning to like them already. Your friend Bob

           Moore deserves a lot more loyalty than this.

                          BILL

           Hey... Why... Why are we staying here shouting at each other

           for ? What's this place ?

                          HECTOR

           I used to work in narcotics. They used to come here a lot.

           I probably fucked and, or arrested half of these people's

           parents. It's a nice place. I like it.

                          BILL

           Makes sense. Look, I'm sorry I haven't got anything for

           you. I'll see you around.

          Bill gets up and leaves the bar. Hector gets up behind him and

          follows him. They meet back in the street.

          THE WHISKY BAR - EXTERIOR NIGHT

                          HECTOR

           So, that's it, hey ?

                          BILL

           Yeah.

                          HECTOR

           Anything you want to tell me ?...

          They put back their jackets.

                          BILL

                          NO

           VOICE OF THE CAR VALET

           Yeah, it's a four-door, man !

          Hector and Bill are walking slowly in front of the bar.

                          HECTOR

           So you better shut the group down.

                          BILL

           Who say I hadn't ?

                          HECTOR

           Oh, have you or haven't you ?

                          BILL

           They ask me to take over the group. I couldn't say no.

                          HECTOR

           Ha ! Ha !... I figured... You're gonna do real well in this

           town. Shut the fucker down.

                          BILL

           Stop. You sent me over there.

                          HECTOR

           No, I send you there to convey a piece of bad news...

          A pedestrian bumps into Hector.

           Will you give me a break, will you, man !...

          Hector lays the man on the hood of a car and frisks him.

           I didn't send you there to go trolling for business.

                          BILL

           Come on !

          Hector lets the man go and starts walking again with Bill near the

          bar.

                          HECTOR

           You told me you couldn't handle it.

                          BILL

           Well, it turns out that I handle it now.

                          HECTOR

           You stick you dick in a barrel full of barracudas once.

           Maybe you won't lose it. You leave it in there, it's gonna

           get shewed up at the root.

          They stop walking.

                          BILL

           I appreciate your concern for my dick, Hector, thank you.

                          HECTOR

           I am being really nice, full of concern for your safety, in

           case it's one of them, hey ? Shut it down, OK ?...

                          BILL

           No... I can't do that.

                          HECTOR

          He yells.

           Shut it down, chingada ! Don't be an asshole. You'll find

           another set of wombats to exploit !

                          BILL

           These sudden irrational outbursts, Hector... Did they begin

           in childhood or in puberty?

                          HECTOR

           Get out of my face.

                          BILL

           Am I in your face ? What an interesting choice of words !

           Would you like me in your face ? You're married, Hector ?...

           If you wanna deal with any of these problems, I'll give you

           special rates.

          Bill has moved slightly away from Hector and turns his back to

          him.

                          HECTOR

           Special rates ?... Ha ! ha !... What, like frequent flyer

           miles ?...

          Hector mime something (or someone) crashing on the ground. Then he

          walks around his car.

           Let me ask you something. Are you really color-blind, or is

           that some shit you feed them with so they feel sorry for

           you ?

                          BILL

           No, unfortunately I am color... Did you bug the office ?

                          HECTOR

           Hey, for a shrink, you're pretty fucking dense.

          Hector gets in his car, while the valet is holding the door for

          him. He closes the door and the car moves away, leaving a pensive

          Bill on the sidewalk.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          Bill comes to the keyhole shaped door. We can see his car parked

          behind him. He dial a code on a keyboard and the gate opens behind

          the door. He looks cautiously around him before walking further.

          He presses a switch to close the gate.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Bill enters the house. It is very dark. He opens a glass door and

          walks slowly, while the door closes behind him. He hesitates a

          moment, then walk more decidedly... and falls heavily on the floor !

          He stands back up with some difficulty, and discovers that the

          whole floor is flooded.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY

          Bill enters the kitchen without switching the light on. He takes a

          big butcher's knife in a stand on the table, and looks in the

          corridor.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Bill wades in the flooded corridor. He seems worried and we see

          the knife blade shining. He enters the bathroom, the door of which

          is wide open, and opens the shower stall. A rush of water runs out

          of it. An alarm starts sounding. He goes back into the corridor

          and turns off the garden hose faucet.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - GARDEN - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          The alarm has stopped sounding. Bill is wearing short pants and he

          is emptying a bucket of water on the lawn. Then he spreads a wet

          cloth on the back of a seat. Several other wet clothes are already

          drying.

                          ROSE

           Hello !

                          BILL

           Who's there ?

          We see Rose entering through the keyhole-shaped door.

                          ROSE

           Hi !... Remember me ?... Fender-bender !...

                          BILL

           There she is, a little angel, dancing on the head of a pin.

          Rose gets down the few steps to the garden. She is wearing a light

          flowered summer dress.

                          ROSE

           So... did you get that estimate ?

                          BILL

           No.

                          ROSE

           Waow !... Nice place you got here. It's a little cold... but

           it's kind of tasteful, right ?

                          BILL

           And wet !

                          ROSE

           You too, I guess.

                          BILL

           Cold or tasteful ?

                          ROSE

           So... Are we eating in here, or you take me out ?...

          Bill bursts laughing.

          BIG HOTEL - MAIN HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT

          We still hear Bill's laugh slowly fading out. We are looking above

          the main hall of a big luxurious hotel. Two attendants are pushing

          a baggage cart. We move with them to the restaurant room. Bill and

          Rose are seated at a table.

                          ROSE

           You can't ? ... At all ?... Waow !...

          BIG HOTEL - RESTAURANT - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Close-up on Rose putting lipstick on.

                          ROSE

           Not even a shade of pink ?... Can't tell me if it's smeared

           or not ?

                          BILL

           I can't tell you if your eyes are bloodshed.

                          ROSE

           Really !... That's sad !... You know what ?... In respect for

           your infirmity, I'm gonna give up wearing lipstick.

          Close-up on Rose putting her lipstick in her glass of water.

           There is something about me that I bet you find a little

           strange. Right ?

          In several shots during this dialogue, we see Bill seated in front

          of a mirror wall and Rose's reflection in the mirror behind Bill's

          back.

                          BILL

           What is that ?

                          ROSE

           Well, I haven't asked you what you do.

                          BILL

           That's right. You showed a remarkable restraint.

                          ROSE

           Well, it's because I'd rather guess. You know, I actually

           get upset if someone tries to tell me before I can... figure

           it out for myself, you know ?

                          BILL

           But what if I am ashamed of what I do.

                          ROSE

           Why... Why should you be ashamed of being a shrink.

                          BILL

           Who told you I was a shrink ?

                          ROSE

           Well... Are you ?

                          BILL

           How did you know ?

                          ROSE

           The way you looked at me, you know ?

                          BILL

           How I look at you ?

                          ROSE

           You... you have this kindness in your eyes. But I think

           you're using it to keep me away. You know, you're trying to

           play safe. You're trying to think of a case instead of

           thinking of a female.

                          BILL

           So, you have a tuning fork too.

                          ROSE

           I guess we have a lot in common.

                          BILL

           We seem to be playing the same game.

                          ROSE

           Why do you say I'm playing a game?

                          BILL

           Because you're the fantasy girl, aren't you? Quicksilver?

           The face glimpsed across a crowded room?

                          ROSE

           Yeah, that's... That's exactly what I am.

                          BILL

           You'll be whatever they want you to be... no substance, no

           rules. Light as air. So your feet never have to touch those

           burning hot coals the rest of us walk around on.

                          ROSE

           Yeah. Sort of like... not seeing red?

                          BILL

           Yeah, sort of like that.

          BIG HOTEL - MAIN HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT

          The main hall seen from above. Bill is crossing the hall with Rose

          holding his arm.

                          ROSE

           I was afraid during dinner that you had taken a room

           here... and I might have to decide whether or not to go up

           with you.

          BIG HOTEL - HOTEL MAIN ENTRANCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          Rose and Bill are leaving the hotel.

                          BILL

           Yes, but that was part of my plan. I mean, I wanted to.

          Bill gives a ticket to the car valet.

           Thank you.

                          ROSE

           Oh, I need a taxi. Taxi !

                          BILL

           No, hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait. What are you being so tough

           for ?

                          ROSE

           I'm just beginning to think that maybe I'Il...

          Rose kisses Bill very tenderly, and even with some spirit. While

          kissing, Bill moves Rose to a more discreet place near the

          entrance. He strokes her shoulder and gets the strap of her dress

          a bit down. Then he moves up the bottom of her dress to stroke her

          thigh.

           VOICE OF THE VALET

                         VOICE OVER

           Cab's here ! Yo, who called a taxi ?

                          BILL

           I am thinking you should just let me take you home and

           forget about this stupid taxi.

                          ROSE

          Rose walks to her waiting cab.

           Well, I'm thinkin' you should stay exactly where you are,

           'cause...

          She smiles and looks at Bill's crotch.

           In that condition, you'd get arrested. Start another riot.

                          BILL

           Give me your phone number and address.

                          ROSE

           Why? You want to make me fall to earth and burn my feet ?

           Whatever happened to quicksilver and light as air?

          She opens the cab's door and climbs inside. She waves to Bill.

                          BILL

           She floats away on her sweet young legs. Waves to him once.

           Drives away without a backward glance.

          Rose closes the door and the cabs moves away.

          BOB'S OFFICE - BUILDING - EXTERIOR DAY

          The first sentence of the following dialogue is heard voice-over

          on a wide shot of the modern glass building where Bob's office is

          located.

          BOB'S OFFICE - WORKROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Bill sits behind the desk. In front of the desk, already seated,

          Dale, Richie's brother. He is wearing an open khaki shirt. Bill

          wipes his glasses and puts them on. He is wearing an open light-

          blue shirt.

                          DALE

           Richie is what he is.

                          BILL

           What exactly is that?

                          DALE

           He was born back of a van going up Route 5 to a Grateful

           Dead concert. The first sound he ever heard was "Beat It On

           Down The Line."

          They both laugh.

                          BILL

           Well, it could be worse.

                          DALE

           Not much.

                          BILL

           How long have you been his guardian?

                          DALE

           Since he was nine or ten. But I've always taken care of

           Richie.

                          BILL

           So, what can I do for you ?

                          DALE

           Um, I was hoping you would help me... get Richie out of

           therapy. Look, I know I'm just his brother, but I've been

           like a mother and a father to him...

          Bill takes his glasses off.

           and I know I can get overprotective, but...

                          BILL

           Why would you want to take Richie out of therapy now ?

                          DALE

           What Richie needs is normalcy.

                          BILL

           Well, normalcy...

          Bill gets up and keeps on talking while walking in the room.

           Normalcy can be interpreted in a lot of different ways.

                          DALE

           Richie has practically been raised by the state...

          Bill sits back.

           ... the social workers, psychiatrists... forcing him into

           this, um, psycho-servitude. He is the sweetest kid you'll

           ever meet, but he thinks of himself as handicapped. It just

           isn't right.

                          BILL

           Well, he's got legal problems. Richie was sentenced by the

           court to mandatory treatment.

                          DALE

           Every kid gets into trouble. And that's why I need you to

           help get him out.

                          BILL

           You know, Dale, it's hard to tell when someone's feeling

           pain... but I want you to know...

                          DALE

           If Richie feels pain... then I feel pain. Pretty much in

           tune with him. I just wish you'd give us a chance.

                          BILL

           Let me check out Richie's status. Then, uh, I'll give

           probation a call.

          Bill gets up.

                          DALE

           Oh, thanks. Thanks, Dr. Capa.

          Dale gets up and shakes Bill's hand.

           I really appreciate it.

                          BILL

           You're welcome, Dale. You either lift weights or work with

           your hands.

                          DALE

           Yeah, uh, I make furniture.

                          BILL

           Really.

          Bill sits back, but not Dale.

                          DALE

           Yeah, I made this desk for Bob, to remind him of New York.

                          BILL

           No kidding.

                          DALE

           We called it the Chrysler desk.

                          BILL

           Chrysler.

                          DALE

           You ever see his bed ?

          CASEY'S LOFT - INTERIOR DAY

          Tracking shot starting on a large painting showing a naked woman

          tied with ribbons. We hear the phone ringing. The answering

          machine gets on while the tracking shot moves to a painting

          showing another woman naked but for very small leather panties.

          She is hung upside down with chains and ropes.

           CASEY'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE

           Hi. This is Casey.

           I can't get to the phone right now, so, uh, leave a

           message. Thanks.

          A beep ends the message. The tracking shot moves on to a

          motorcycle, looking old, then to another painting showing a

          redhead woman wearing a bustier, a garter belt and hoses, all red.

          She is standing on hands and knees and she is wrapped with chains.

          We hear Bill's voice leaving a message on the answering machine.

           BILL'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE

           Casey, this is Bill Capa. It's around noon. Your father

           sent me a check for the private sessions you were having

           with Bob. Should I send the check back or do you want to

           continue ? Let me know, okay ?

          A click ends the message. During Bill's message, the tracking shot

          moves to a giant plastic statue, with Walt Disney's Pluto's head

          on a human male body. Then the tracking shot moves more quickly to

          another painting showing a redhead woman wearing a close-fitting

          sexy black overall. Then a close shot on a painting of a woman

          wearing a harness with spikes. Further away we see another

          painting showing a redhead woman being whipped. At the end of

          Bill's message, the tracking shots ends on Casey lying supine on a

          weightlifting bench. His writs are tied to the vertical bars where

          a dumbbell is resting.

                          CASEY

           I think I want to continue.

          We hear the crack of a whip. Since the shot is showing only

          Casey's head and chest, we don't see who is whipping him.

           You bitch !

          Another whip crack.

           I called you a bitch !

          Whip crack.

           I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

          Whip crack. The tracking shot starts moving backwards, but with a

          larger angle.

           Oh!

          Whip crack. Casey's voice is softer. Medium long shot on the room.

           Oh! I'm sorry.

          Almost hysterical laugh.

          ROAD IN FRONT OF BOB'S RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY

          We see Bill, bare chest, wearing sneakers short pants and cap,

          running toward us. His T-shirt is hanging at his side, partly

          stuck in the elastic band of his shorts. Bill stops running when

          he reaches the mailbox, hesitates one moment, comes two steps back

          and opens the box. Close-up on the box, inside of which a coiled

          rattlesnake whips a menacing forked tongue. The snake rattles,

          then the front half of the snake jumps out of the box, with its

          mouth wide open. Bill falls on the road, where he remains seated

          without moving. The snake, with the back half of his body still in

          the box, doesn't seem to know what it must do next.

           A car arrives at a high rate of speed. Since a pick-up is parked

          on the other side of the road, the car must zigzag and it barely

          avoid driving on Bill.

                          BILL

          Yelling to the driver.

           Hey !

          The car honks. We get a close-up of the driver when the car comes

          very close to Bill.

                          THE DRIVER

           You idiot !

          Bill looks at the departing car and notices a city worker blowing

          dead leaves on the bank of the road.

                          BILL

          He yells to the city worker, but, with the loud noise of his power

          blower, the man does not hears him and remains concentrated on his

          work.

           Hey ! Hey !... Help !... Shit !

          Bill crawls back a little, then he eventually stands up. He

          crosses the road, and takes a big shovel in the pick-up truck.

           Fuck !

          He crosses the road back. The snake is back in the mailbox.

           Hello !

          Bill hits the box very hard with the shovel. Snake and mail fall

          on the road. Bill laughs and throws the shovel on the side of the

          road.

           I am not goin' back to New York, you hear me ? You're stuck

           with me !

          Bill stoops to pick up the letters scattered on the road. He looks

          at the envelopes.

           Fuckin' bill. Great.

          We see the snake disappearing through the grass on the side of the

          road. Bill, with his back to the road, is getting ready to enter

          the house. A car stops and honks. Bill turns around to face

          Hector.

                          HECTOR

           Capa !

                          BILL

          He comes back to the car. He looks very angry.

           Oh, that's perfect ! That's really perfect ! Just like a

           cop ! You're never there when you need one !

                          HECTOR

           What did I do now ?

                          BILL

           Somebody put a rattlesnake in the mailbox, Hector !

                          HECTOR

          He laughs.

           A rattlesnake !

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY

          Bill is washing his arms in the sink.

                          HECTOR

           You scared the shit out of me outside.

                          BILL

           Oh, I scared you, huh ? What the hell are you doing here ?

                          HECTOR

           I could use some assistance, some of your professional

           wisdom.

                          BILL

           I'm really flattered.

                          HECTOR

           Everyone in the group has an alibi. Except for Casey. He

           says he was alone in his loft.

                          BILL

           Yeah ?

                          HECTOR

           Mm-hmm.

                          BILL

           What does that mean ?

          He dries his arms with a dishcloth.

                          HECTOR

           What do you make of Casey?

                          BILL

           He's a good kid.

                          HECTOR

           You're an asshole, Capa.

          Bill turns the water off, throws the dishcloth on the sink. Hector

          walks in the room while wiping his hands with another dishcloth.

                          BILL

           Should we analyze that statement, Hector ?

                          HECTOR

           Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on. Who is our man ?

           Help me.

                          BILL

           You're the cop. Figure it out.

          He gets out of the kitchen, followed by Hector.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR DAY

                          HECTOR

           You know what I think ? I think it was you. You've got the

           look.

                          BILL

           That's right.

                          HECTOR

           Yeah, I been talking to people who knew you both. Everyone

           says there was a weird competitive thing going between you.

          They have come to the hall where the security TV screens are

          located. They stop walking.

                          BILL

           Yeah, that's right. There was. I admit it. He was on the

           way up... and I was on the way down.

                          HECTOR

           Including...

          He whistles, miming, with both hands, something crashing down.

           Splat ! It unhinged you.

                          BILL

           I bet you've seen every episode of Columbo, huh?

          Sound of a buzz. The two men look at the security screen.

           Who is it?

          Bill taps on the remote control, and Rose appears on the screen.

                          ROSE

           Hi. It's me, Rose. The old fender bender.

          Bill taps again on the remote control to open the gate, and Rose

          leaves the TV screen.

                          HECTOR

           That's a very young girl to be going around... fending

           benders.

          Bill puts the remote control down and follows Hector to the main

          gate.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - GARDEN - EXTERIOR DAY

          Hector is walking to the exit. As he reaches the bottom of the

          steps, Rose is going down. Bill, standing behind a low wall, looks

          at her coming.

                          BILL

           Here she comes. Weightless, hanging from the sky... wearing

           a short dress of indeterminate color.

                          ROSE

           It's red, poor thing.

                          BILL

           Thank you.

          They kiss. Rose takes his hand.

                          ROSE

           I was thinking. Maybe I should see a shrink.

                          BILL

           I can recommend someone.

                          ROSE

           I feel better already.

          Close-up on their kissing.

                          BILL

           God, I missed you.

          They are now at the edge of the pool.

                          ROSE

           This time you won't miss.

          They fall fully dressed in the pool.

           Underwater shot. They keep on kissing in the water. Bill takes

          her dress off. She wears nothing underneath. We can see a rose

          tattooed on her buttock. She slips Bill's short down to his

          ankles. We get a brief view of Bill's penis.

           Above water shot. They are now in the water up to their waists.

          Bill is kissing Rose's breasts.

           Underwater shot. They are back underwater. Bill is kissing Rose's

          legs, and moves slowly up to her crotch. She has trimmed pubic

          hair, but with some left. Still kissing, Bill moves up along her

          stomach and reaches hers breasts, which he kisses greedily.

           Above water shot. Bill is leaning his back against the edge of

          the pool. Rose is lying on him. They are still in the water up to

          their waists.

           Underwater shot. Rose is kissing Bill's chest et goes slowly down

          his stomach, then along one of his legs. We get another brief view

          of Bill's penis. We notice that it is not erected (certainly to

          avoid being X-rated).

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Multiple shots of Bill and Rose making love, seen through the

          piece of art. Then tracking shot on the two bodies fondling each

          other.

           Shot on the bedroom window, and two hand-glider in the

          californian sky.

           Back to the lovers couple. They are sweating profusely. Their

          position and their movements suggest, without actually showing it,

          that Bill is inside Rose. Bill turns Rose around to put her lying

          on her stomach. Rose holds the two sculpted bed posts very

          tightly. It is suggested that Bill could be sodomizing her.

           They both moan. The moaning increases with a suggestion of an

          orgasm.

                          ROSE

          Still holding the bedposts. She speaks with a breathless voice.

           I want you to get dressed up... Get dressed up... All right ?

          She turns around to face him.

           I want to get dressed up.

                          BILL

           Right now ?

                          ROSE

           Uh-huh.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - DINING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Through the window, we notice that the night has fallen. Bill,

          seated behind the table, is wearing brown suit and necktie, very

          elegant. On the table, wine and water glasses and two chandeliers,

          with a lighted candle. In front of Bill, a plate with food. Rose

          enters the field, carrying another plate, which she sets on the

          other side of the table.

           In the plate, a piece of grilled beef, noodles et vegetables.

           Rose sits behind her plate. As the table is made of glass, we see

          that Rose is naked.

                          ROSE

           You're not eating. Don't you like my food?

                          BILL

           I'd like your food five inches to the left.

                          ROSE

           Okay.

          Rose moves the plate to her left, showing her naked body though

          the glass table.

           But if you don't like this... I have something else for

           you.

           She laughs.

                          BILL

           Yeah, okay.

                          ROSE

           I think it's ready.

          She stands up laughing. Fade out on the next scene.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Long scene on the couple making love standing under the shower.

          Fade out on the next scene.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Bill wakes up, naked, and alone in the bed. One of his hand is

          cuffed to one of the bedpost with a long strap. He laughs.

          ARCHIVES ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          An archives room, congested with shelves from floor to ceiling. On

          these shelves, hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of files, stacked

          not too cleanly. Bill is leaning on one of the shelves. The

          archivist, a forty-year old lady, appears from behind another

          shelf, apparently coming down some steps. Bill stands up.

                          THE ARCHIVIST

           It's a miracle. I found it.

          She starts walking between two rows of shelves. Bill follows her,

          putting his glasses on.

           Here he is. Richie Dexter. Legal guardian: Dale Dexter.

           That's his brother. Kids were put under care, let's see,

           about six years ago.

                          BILL

          He tries to read above her shoulder.

           Does it say why?

                          THE ARCHIVIST

           Abandonment, abuse. The children were assigned to a, uh...

          She flips a page in the file.

           Dr. Niedelmeyer in Pasadena. A child psychiatrist. Richie

           was 12.

          Bill tries to come back to the preceding page, but the archivist

          looks angrily at him, silently meaning he is going a bit too far.

           No foster parents. Looks like the doctor retired a couple

           years after that. Then we lost track of the kids until

           recently.

                          BILL

           What do you mean, "lost track" of them?

                          THE ARCHIVIST

          She closes the file, and keeps on walking between the rows of

          shelves, followed by Bill.

           Like on a radar : One minute a blip, the next, no blip.

           Hey, look. This is the lost souls memorial wing. Children

           of L.A. County of the '90s: 250 000 cases in here, and

           there's two more down the hall.

          SONDRA'S RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          The room is decorated in quite a luxurious way, but with a lot of

          good taste. Paintings on the walls. Bed covered with an

          embroidered bedspread, and many cushions. At the foot end of the

          bed, a small upholstered bench.

           Two women enter the room, laughing and carrying many parcels,

          which they throw on the bed.

                          BONNIE

           Nobody's like your ex-husband!

                          SONDRA

           That's for sure. That's for sure.

          Bonnie takes one of the parcel, a large white box.

           Okay, okay, okay.

                          BONNIE

          She takes a white dress out of the box. For the first time, we see

          a close-up of her face, and we discover she is Rose, different

          hairdo, a lot of almost vulgar make-up, but still, she is Rose.

           Here it is. Oh, Sondra, it is so beautiful. Isn't it

           great ?

                          SONDRA

           I know. It's incredible. Look at all these bags.

                          ROSE

          She shamelessly takes off the dress, and, as she wears no bra, she

          stands naked, save for her panties, in front of Sondra.

           Oh, the man that was staring at you in the shop... was so

           funny.

          She laughs. Sondra freezes watching the naked body of her friend.

           I think I should have got it in green or something.

                          ROSE

           Oh ! Oh ! Lush !

          She has put the white dress on.

           What do you think?

                          SONDRA

          She seems very moved.

           I think... you look beautiful.

                          ROSE

           You sure ?

                          SONDRA

           Oh, yeah.

                          ROSE

           Come zip me up.

                          SONDRA

           Okay. Okay.

          She gets up from the bed to zip up Rose's dress.

           Oh, this is so tight.

                          ROSE

           Thank you.

                          SONDRA

           I need to find a new husband.

          They both laugh. Sondra goes back sitting on the bed and looking

          through the parcels.

           I need some more money.

                          ROSE

           Oh, men. Who needs them ? Have you seen my earrings

           anywhere ?

                          SONDRA

          She waves the earrings in front of Rose's face.

           Yes, I've got them.

                          ROSE

           Oh, sweet !

          Rose takes off the large rings she is wearing to replace them by

          the earrings Sondra just gave her. She sighs.

           Oh, my God. I love these. Aren't they pretty ?

                          SONDRA

           They're so gorgeous, yes.

                          ROSE

           Try yours on.

                          SONDRA

          Sondra doesn't move, feeling very embarrassed by the idea of

          undressing in front of her friend.

           Okay.

          She eventually gets up, an starts taking off the belt from her

          suit. Rose is putting her jacket on. A long silence : Sondra looks

          more and more embarrassed. She snickers stupidly. Rose looks at

          her without really understanding what's going on.

                          ROSE

           What now ? Sondra, what ?

                          SONDRA

          She sits back on the bed.

           I feel embarrassed.

                          ROSE

           Why?

                          SONDRA

           'Cause... the way you're looking at me.

                          ROSE

           Sondra... Do men look at you like that ?

                          SONDRA

           No... Yes... But it's different.

                          ROSE

          She bends to her.

           You know, Sondra... it doesn't have to be any different at

           all.

          The phone rings. Rose starts laughing.

           You better get that.

                          SONDRA

          She takes the phone.

           Hello. Oh, h-hi. Um... Oh...

          She seems embarrassed. Rose is making funny faces.

           Um, mmm, okay.

          She stammers a little.

           N... My trainer's coming at 2:30, but that's... Yeah. You

           are? Okay !...

          She goes to the window and moves the curtain aside. We see Bob's

          car in the street.

           Um, oh, there you are ! Okay, okay. I'll see you in a

           minute !

          STREET IN FRONT OF SONDRA'S RESIDENCE -- BOB'S CAR - EXTERIOR DAY

          Bill drives and holds his car phone on his ear.

                          SONDRA'S VOICE

           Bye.

          Bill hangs up his car phone.

          SONDRA'S RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                          ROSE

          She is looking at herself in the full-length mirror.

           Who's that?

                          SONDRA

           That's my analyst ! He's coming to visit me.

                          ROSE

          When she hears Sondra's last reply, Rose's carefree face becomes

          very anxious.

           He what?

                          SONDRA

           Oh, my God. He's coming over.

                          ROSE

           Sondra, thanks. Oh, thanks a lot !

                          SONDRA

           What's the matter ? What ?

                          ROSE

           Nothing !

          She starts gathering her belongings.

           If you don't know, I thought we were just going to have a

           nice afternoon together... maybe have dinner.

                          SONDRA

          She puts the telephone back on its stand and takes Rose's arm.

           Well, we can. Oh, don't worry. Don't be upset. You can stay

           here. Really.

                          ROSE

          She closes her purse and puts it over her shoulder.

           You just don't understand, do you?

                          SONDRA

           I don't.

                          ROSE

           Nobody appreciates you the way that I do. People just use

           you, and you don't even see it.

                          SONDRA

           Oh, don't be upset.

          She turns to Rose to look at her face.

                          ROSE

          Rose kisses Sondra tenderly on the lips.

           That's more like it. Ciao.

          She leaves the room. Sondra seems very disturbed by the kiss. She

          puts her hands on her chest.

                          SONDRA

           Oh, my God.

          SONDRA'S RESIDENCE - HALL AND SITTING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Rose gets quickly down the stairs. Chimes. Rose gets large

          sunglasses out of her purse and adjust them on her nose before

          opening the front door.

           She opens the door to face Bill whom she almost jostle to get

          outside as fast as possible. Through a low window, we see her

          going down the stairs to the street.

           Larger shot. We discover the sitting-room next to the hall. Good

          taste expensive furniture, nice paintings, concert piano.

           Sondra gets down the stairs. Bill, who was looking around him,

          turns to her.

                          BILL

           Hi, Sondra. Someone just let me in.

                          SONDRA

           Hi.

                          BILL

           I didn't just walk in on my own.

                          SONDRA

          She closes the front door, which had remained open.

           Oh... no. That was my, um... That was my girlfriend,

           Bonnie. Yeah.

                          BILL

           Bonnie. Yes.

                          SONDRA

           Please, come in.

                          BILL

           Thank you very much. Thank you.

          He enters the sitting-room, followed by Sondra.

           This is a really lovely place you have here. Yeah.

          He sits on a cushions-covered sofa.

                          SONDRA

           You think so? Thank you.

          She sits on a small sofa without back.

                          BILL

           A lot of nice, nice things. A lot of nice art.

                          SONDRA

          She simpers a little.

           What did you come here for?

                          BILL

           Well, I feel like I have so much... so much catching up to

           do with all of you. And I know that you're very close with

           Richie. And I was wondering if you could tell me anything

           that might help me... understand him a little better.

                          SONDRA

           Richie's... my little baby.

                          BILL

           His brother Dale thinks that your "little baby"... should

           be taken out of therapy.

                          SONDRA

           That's insane!

                          BILL

          He gets up.

           I think it's a mistake too.

          He goes to the window and looks at the children playing in a park.

                          SONDRA

           That Dale is a dangerous bastard.

                          BILL

           But he obviously seems to care for Richie a great deal.

           There's a big gap in Richie's life up until about a year

           ago. Did he ever mention a Dr. Niedelmeyer to you ?

                          SONDRA

           I don't have much to tell. Richie's okay. He's sweet. Did

           you know that he was... molested as a child ?

          She has tears in her eyes.

                          BILL

           No, I didn't know that.

          He comes back to her.

           It's sticking out all over.

          He sits on the bench of the piano.

                          SONDRA

           It's fashionable.

          She laughs nervously.

           I mean, it pays well. At least, you know, you can write a

           book, go on Oprah.

                          BILL

           That was quite a show he gave us in group. You think Richie

           has a violent streak ?

                          SONDRA

          She sighs.

           Oh. Let's cut to the chase. Richie did not kill Bob Moore.

           You know... it's really swell. Snooping around here...

          She gets up.

           ... sniffing for blood on other people's hands... while

           pretending to help your patients ?

                          BILL

           You really think that I don't care about Richie ?

                          SONDRA

          She gets upset.

           Richie wouldn't hurt a fly ! Why don't you take a look at

           someone dangerous. Why don't you take a look at someone who

           could do it ! Why don't you take a look at Clark !

                          BILL

           Clark ?

                          SONDRA

          She gets more and more upset.

           Clark ! Clark ! Clark is a sneaky, lying, button-down son

           of a bitch... who pretends to be this gentle creature ! I

           heard him screaming one night at Bob. It made the hairs on

           my neck stand up ! Anyway... I hope that they fry...

           whoever did it, and it takes a really long time. And

           then... And then a fuse blows. They have to start all over

           again.

          She sits back. Bill has been listening to her outburst without

          reacting.

           We hear the front door chimes, and Sondra's expression changes

          immediately. Her angry face becomes suddenly softer.

           She snickers and puts her tongue to her lips.

           Wow ! That's my trainer.

          She gets up and sniffs a bit.

           I gotta go. I gotta get the door.

          She goes to the front door and opens it to a very muscular young

          man wearing a sleeveless T-shirt.

           This is my trainer, Chris.

                          BILL

           Hi.

          Chris just nods his head.

           Bye-bye.

          Bill gets out. As soon as the door is closes, Sondra literally

          jumps in Chris' arms, and starts giggling.

                          SONDRA

           I don't feel like lifting weights today.

                          CHRIS

           Okay.

                          SONDRA

           Let's do something else.

          She bursts laughing.

           Through the low window, we see Bill going down the stairs to the

          street. He stops for two seconds to look at the tender couple !

          DALE'S WORKSHOP - PARKING - EXTERIOR DAY

          Bob's car stops in front of a slightly dilapidated building, on a

          desert parking lot. The building could be an old factory

          reconverted by Dale into a workshop to make his furniture. A very

          high chimney above the building.

           Bill, dressed in jeans and light-colored shirt, gets out of the

          car and walks toward the building. He passes a board that

          indicates the location of the office. He knocks at a door with a

          window and a grating and a sign that says beware of the dog. The

          dog starts barking. Bill knocks again. He tries to look through

          the door window. The dog keeps on barking.

           Bill comes back the way he came toward the office. He stops in

          front of a window and bends to try to see something inside. He

          knocks on the window. He turns around, and we catch a quick

          glimpse of someone behind the window.

           Bill comes back to the parking lot toward a pickup that two men

          are unloading.

                          BILL

           Hey! Is this Dale Dexter's shop here?

          One of the men nods and shows the main door to Bill.

          DALE'S WORKSHOP - INTERIOR DAY

          Entrance of the workshop. The door opens and Bill appears. He

          takes off his sunglasses, puts them in the pocket of his shirt and

          gets in.

           The workshop has a very high ceiling and looks a bit dilapidated.

          On the roof of a small structure (perhaps the quoted office)

          sits the impressive statue of a lion who gives the impression to

          watch Bill.

           Bill keeps on walking and passes a spray of burning sparks.

          Someone must be using a blowtorch in the neighborhood.

           Bill looks around him, looking a bit anxious. Several men are

          working. He approaches one of them, wearing a sleeveless T-shirt,

          and who is welding, with a protection mask covering his face.

                          BILL

           Excuse me.

          The man stands up and puts down the piece he was welding. He

          raises his mask : It's Dale.

                          DALE

           Hello. Did you go to the house?

                          BILL

           Yeah. Nobody was home. I would have phoned a...

          Dale shuts his blowtorch off.

           I would have phone ahead, but, uh, I don't have your phone

           number in our file.

                          DALE

          He takes off his mask, then his protection gloves.

           No problem. So, uh, did you make up your mind ?

                          BILL

           After Dr. Niedelmeyer, did Richie get another

           psychiatrist ?

                          DALE

           No. No, we moved.

          Dale goes around a huge, geometrically shaped, metallic structure.

           Richie went to school. Everything was fine.

                          BILL

           Well... that's the problem, Dale. I look at Richie, and I

           don't see that everything is fine. I see a kid that's on

           the brink.

                          DALE

          He starts working on the metallic structure, but stops to look at

          Bill.

           A person, uh, gets a bullet in the head. Sometimes they

           just leave it there 'cause... to fuck around in the brain

           is gonna paralyze the person. That's Richie.

                          BILL

           What's the bullet ?

                          DALE

           Whatever it was, I got him away.

          He has taken protection glasses to work.

                          BILL

           You want to talk about that ?

                          DALE

           No. I want you to stop trying to tear off the scabs. Let

           the demons rest. You dig around in Richie's head, he's

           gonna blow up in your face.

                          BILL

           You think he's violent ?

                          DALE

           Not with me.

                          BILL

           I think you're making a mistake, Dale. This is not the time

           to take Richie out of therapy. If you don't like me, let's

           get him someone else.

                          DALE

           Jesus Christ. One of you is the same as another.

                          BILL

           Yeah.

          NIEDELMEYER'S RESIDENCE - GARDEN - EXTERIOR DAY

          Bill gets out of his car. He is wearing light-colored pants, a

          shirt, and a very elegant leather jacket. He walks up a few steps

          toward the house.

           He crosses the garden, then reaches the very impressive main door

          of the house. Above the door, two similar faces are carved in the

          stone. Probably Doctor Niedelmeyer's face.

           A small panel opens in the door and Edith Niedelmeyer's face

          appears.

                          BILL

           Mrs. Niedelmeyer?

                          EDITH

           Yes.

                          BILL

           Hi, I'm Bill Capa. I'm a doctor. I tracked you down through

           the Psychiatric Institute.

                          EDITH

           How very enterprising of you.

          She slams the panel shut. A few seconds, then she opens the door.

                          BILL

           Actually, I was wondering if I could speak to Dr.

           Niedelmeyer.

                          EDITH

           My husband died last year. If it makes you feel better, he

           suffered a lot. Well, anyway, it made me feel better.

                          BILL

           I'm treating a young man that was a patient... of Dr.

           Niedelmeyer's when he was a child. His name is Richie

           Dexter.

                          EDITH

           Why don't you leave me alone ?

                          BILL

           If I could just ask you a few questions.

                          EDITH

           You get out of here before I call the police !

          She angrily slams the door shut.

                          BILL

           Just a few questions. Mrs. Niedelmeyer...

                          EDITH

          Voice over through the door.

           Get out of here !

          Bill sighs, then walks away from the door. The camera moves above

          the door and ends up on a close-up of Niedelmeyer's carved face,

          who seems to sneer at Bill.

          BOB'S OFFICE - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Night is falling on L.A. Clark, in the foreground, is counting

          books. Behind him, Richie, Buck and Casey are seated, Casey in his

          favorite hand-shaped armchair. Sondra is standing up.

                          CLARK

           Fifty-eight. Now, if I'm not mistaken... last week there

           were 59 books on the shelf and this week there are only 58

           books on the shelf somehow.

                          BUCK

           Clark... what's the ashtray situation ?

          Sondra sits down and Casey sits in another armchair.

                          CLARK

           Three. Not four, as recommended. There are three chairs and

           five assorted sofas.

                          BUCK

           Who cares ?

                          BILL

          He just came in and is standing by the window. He is wearing his

          glasses, jeans, open shirt and a light grey jacket. He turns

          around to speak to the group.

           Okay, let's get started.

                          BUCK

          Finishing a sentence the beginning of which was not

          understandable.

           ... an emotional tar baby.

                          BILL

           Today I'd like to focus on a most enlightening... and

           challenging topic.

                          SONDRA

          She is - a bit lasciviously - sprawled in her armchair.

           Sex.

                          BILL

           More or less. You see, the primary romantic relationship...

           in our life is often a symptom of our illness.

          He has seated himself in the hand-shaped armchair.

                          CASEY

           Glad I wore my rubber pants.

          Buck snickers.

                          BILL

           We keep making the same neurotic choices over and over

           every time we choose a new mate. So... If you had a magic

           wand... if you, uh, had a wish list... and could change

           your partner... Sondra, how would you make them different ?

           What's wrong ? What's missing ?

                          SONDRA

           Now ?

                          BILL

           You need a minute to think about it ?

                          CLARK

           She's totally forgot her Rolodex.

          Casey snickers.

           Sorry, sorry.

                          SONDRA

           Well, I don't have an attachment in my life right now. The

           last one sort of went to pieces. If you enjoy sex... A man

           thinks you're doing it with everybody.

                          BILL

           He was jealous.

          He gets ups, walks to a cupboard, opens its door and takes a cup.

                          SONDRA

           That's right. And I was as good as gold.

                          BILL

           Well, there's a good chance that he was the one that was

           sleeping around... and projecting his fantasies and desires

           onto you.

                          SONDRA

           This guy had a major projection, and he couldn't keep it in

           his pants.

          The whole group laughs. Bill smiles while pouring himself a

          coffee.

                          SONDRA

           Anyway, I do have this girlfriend. She really makes me

           laugh. A wish list. I wish... she was a guy.

                          BILL

          He comes back with his cup in his hand.

           Fair enough. Casey, what do you got for us?

                          CASEY

          He is playing with a small statue of a monkey who looks at a

          skull.. He waits a few seconds, and puts the statue down before

          speaking.

           Well... I met this girl about a month ago. I've painted

           every inch of her in detail. She's the best model I've ever

           seen. Completely uninhibited. Does whatever I ask no matter

           how...

                          BUCK

          He smiles.

           I'll bet she does.

                          CASEY

           That's right, Buck. See, but this is where the problem

           comes in. It's what you see beneath the skin... when you

           study somebody endlessly, the way an artist does. I see a

           transcendental beauty there... beyond anything I could

           ever, ever imagine.

                          BILL

           How does this woman feel about you?

                          CASEY

           She thinks I'm the living end because I've got talent. But,

           I mean, what's talent ? Kick a garbage can... starving

           artists crawl out, right ? But there's only one, unique

           her. And, uh, I think it's love, you know ? And, um... I

           don't know what to do about that.

          He is suddenly moved on the verge of tears.

                          BILL

           Do you think she loves you ?

                          CASEY

           No. No.

                          BILL

           Do you care, Casey ?

                          CASEY

           I don't know. I don't know.

                          BUCK

           He's a romantic. He loves the suffering.

                          CASEY

           Maybe being who I am... I have no choice.

                          BILL

           Very good, Casey. That's good stuff.

                          SONDRA

           I agree.

                          BILL

           Buck, what do you got?

                          BUCK

          He jumps.

           Oh, nothing to talk about, not compared to that.

                          BILL

           It's not a contest.

                          BUCK

          He lights a cigarette.

           Hey, Yard Sale, you want to share the ashtray ?

          Casey puts his foot on the ashtray to prevent Buck from using it.

           Thanks a lot.

          He gets up.

           Forget it. You want to share something, share the ashtray.

          He sits on a small armchair by a glass table with an ashtray on

          it.

           I got something in my life, something new. You know, she's

           young. Auburn hair, 5'5", 105. Pretty as hell. I see her on

           weekends.

          He picks up the ashtray and moves to sit in a more comfortable

          armchair.

           I don't think she'd sleep with a man unless she was married

           to him.

                          BILL

          He has taken his glasses off.

           Anything else you'd like to tell us?

                          BUCK

           She doesn't mind the gray, you know.

          Bill smiles.

           She's fragile... you know ? It's like she's running through

           my fingers. Two people I loved died. I never thought that I

           could feel anything.

                          BILL

           Good, Buck. Richie. How 'bout you ?

                          RICHIE

          He is playing with the statue of the monkey.

           I don't have,really, relationships. I have m-my brother.

                          BILL

           Okay. You want to talk about him?

                          RICHIE

           H-He worries a-a lot about me. And he l-loves me. But l...

           I wish he didn't... love me so m... so much sometimes. I

           wish l-I had more of a l-life.

          He puts the statue down and gets up.

           And I know that everyone h-here thinks that I'm gay... but

           I'm-I'm not. A-And I don't want to be.

          Richie opens the cupboard, takes a can of Pepsi and opens it.

                          BILL

           What would you like to be ?

                          RICHIE

           I'd like t-to be a w-woman.

                          BILL

           Have you seen a doctor ?

                          RICHIE

           Yeah.

                          BUCK

           So the next step is the chop.

                          BILL

          He cuts him very curtly.

           Thank you, Buck. Anything else you'd like to tell us,

           Richie ?

                          RICHIE

           Nope.

                          BILL

           Very good. Hi, Clark. What would you change about your

           partner ?

                          CLARK

          He is manicuring with his handkerchief.

           Um, I think I'll pass... today.

                          SONDRA

           Excuse me. You think you're gonna pass today ? Don't you

           think that's kind of a betrayal to the rest of the group ?

           I mean, we're all sitting here sharing our most intimate

           thoughts... and you're just gonna pass today ?

                          CLARK

           Well, Sondra, I have my little problems... but I don't s-

           see how it's your business...

                          SONDRA

           Your "little problems" ?

                          CLARK

           To decide when I'm gonna share in group and not.

                          SONDRA

           Ah, I see. You're smiling. Is that a smile ? You think this

           is funny ?

          She gets up from her armchair.

           Look at you. Just look at you. Look at your hair.

          Buck snickers.

           Who do you think you are ? Huh ? You think you're God's

           gift to women ? Let me tell you something. You are nothing.

           Nothing but a shallow, rigid... self-protective, anal

           coward ! And I'll tell you what your little fucking

           problems are...

                          CLARK

          He gets ups, looking angry.

           Oh, shut up ! Shut up, shut up ! You promiscuous cunt ! And

           if you must know, I do have somebody in my life ! Black,

           emotional hole, unattractive me !

          He walks nervously to the door. Sondra remains standing, looking a

          bit embarrassed.

                          BUCK

          He snickers.

           You can say that again !

                          CLARK

          He slams furiously the door.

           Fuck you ! Fuck all of you !

                          CASEY

           Is this what you call "treatment failure" ?

          Buck snickers.

                          BILL

           Well, it's not a total loss. He left without counting

           everything.

          He puts down the file he was holding in his hand.

          CLARK'S RESIDENCE - STREET IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE - EXTERIOR DAY

          A quiet little street, surrounded by houses an buildings of good

          standing. Children in roller skates are playing hockey on the

          pavement.

                          CHILDREN

           Come on !... Hey, right here !... Hit it !

          Bob's car arrives in the street. The children moves away to let it

          pass. While Bill is parking the car, we hear, in voice over, the

          beginning of the conversation between Bill and Clark. Bill is

          wearing a light-colored shirt and beige pants.

                          CLARK

          Voice over.

           So pretty soon the relevant numbers weren't enough. I had

           to know all the irrelevant numbers... like the numbers of

           pages in each deposition.

          CLARK'S RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Walls are white, furniture modern, but with good taste. Everything

          is meticulously clean and tidy. Bill sits in an armchair. Clark is

          standing by the window.

                          BILL

           So you were fired.

                          CLARK

          He takes off his sunglasses and gets regular glasses from his

          shirt pocket. He is wearing disposable gloves.

           Yes. In effect. Obsessive-compulsive. Medical leave.

          He puts his glasses on.

           "Just please, please don't come back."

          He sits down and sighs.

           I do apologize for my outburst in group.

                          BILL

           You're screwing Sondra... aren't you?

                          CLARK

          He puts his sunglasses in his shirt pocket, gets back up and start

          walking in the room.

           I'm very fond of Sondra. More than that, perhaps. Sondra

           is... A very warmhearted woman, but...

          While talking, he sprays a liquid from a can on his plants.

           Tissues. Panty hose. CDs put back in the rack without

           cases. Frying pans with coagulating grease. Cotton balls.

           Cotton balls. I mean, my God, the cotton balls that woman

           used. Unspeakable items of underwear left hanging in the

           shower. Chewed gum in the ashtrays. I made a list. There

           were 22 items I couldn't take.

                          BILL

           It must be difficult to find someone... to measure up to

           your keen sense of order.

                          CLARK

           I found someone. This woman thinks I'm messy. It's perfect.

           She comes, she goes. I don't even know she's been except

           for the faint smell of perfume.

                          BILL

          Bill sneers.

           Nice. And what does Sondra think of this woman ?

                          CLARK

           Take a look at this.

          He goes to a closet, from which he gets a paper bag. From the bags

          he takes out a tattered piece of clothing.

           Sondra tried to do this to my clothes... while I was

           wearing them; butcher knife in hand, screaming. The next

           day she came back, did this to my friend's dress. I'm

           terrified to go near the woman.

          FREEWAY, THEN ROAD - EXTERIOR DAY

          Cars on the freeway. Among them Bob's car. The car phone is

          ringing. Bill picks up the phone, while he keeps on driving. He is

          wearing sunglasses.

                          BILL

           Hello ?... Hello, this is Bill Capa.

           THE VOICE IN THE PHONE

          Giggly voice sounding like a child's voice.

           Hey, puke-face. Look around. Can't you see me ? I'm in the

           red car.

          Bill looks around him on the freeway, and sees a red car on his

          right.

           You got doo-doo in your eyes... or caca on the brain, Dr.

           Shithead Capa.

          Strange sounding giggles.

                          BILL

           Does your mommy know you escaped from the straightjacket?

           THE VOICE IN THE PHONE

           Suck my Tinkertoy, you faggot cretin... after you suck my

           scalpel, Doctor.

          Bill puts the phone down and speeds the car up to avoid the red

          car which is still following him. The red car catches up with him

          and bumps into him. Bill jumps up.

                          BILL

           Goddamn it !

          The red car bumps into him a second time, and looses part of its

          radiator grill.

           Third bumps. Bill is now out of the freeway and on a road

          downtown.

           The two vehicles are zigzagging between the others cars. Lot of

          honking.

           Without warning, Bill turns on a side street on his right, and

          gets honked by the other cars. In spite of the very dangerous

          driving of Bill among the other cars, the red car keeps on

          following him.

           To follow Bill, the red car must take a vey sharp left turn, and

          bumps into a pickup truck full of kits and gears which fall on the

          pavement.

           The chase goes on. The red car is dented everywhere. It catches

          up with Bill, overtakes him, and bumps violently into Bill's car

          right side.

                          BILL

           Fuck you !

          The red car hits him on the right side twice in a row.

           Fuck you!

          Bill hits the red car on its left side and remains stuck to it.

          They move together, and Bill tries to bring the red car as close

          to the curb as possible.

           Get the... You... Ohh! Get the fuck...

          The red car is so close to the curb that it snatches away the open

          door of a parked car, and then knocks down the shopping caddie of

          a woman. Fortunately, the woman is able to move away, but all her

          shopping items are scattered on the pavement. The two car bump

          again into each other and arrive into a main road.

           When the red car wants to hit Bill's car again, Bill stands on

          the brake and the red car hits a big truck carrying cars. The

          truck honks and start zigzagging in the traffic. The last car on

          the upper bridge of the truck gets loose and falls on the road.

          Bill barely avoids it. Another car gets loose from the truck and

          causes a pile-up on the road.

           Bill zigzag out of the pile-up, and comes to a crossing with a

          railway. A train is approaching. The red car is still behind Bill.

          Bill brakes suddenly just after he has crossed the railway, then

          starts moving backwards. He hits the front of the red car, and

          keeps on moving backwards until he brings the red car on the

          railway itself. The train keeps on honking to move the cars away.

           Hey! You wanna die ! Huh ? You wanna die ?

          We see the driver of the train working madly on his brake, and

          looking to the red car with terror in his eyes.

           Just before the train reaches the crossing, Bill jumps his car

          forward and the red car quickly moves backward.

           Bill stops a few feet after the crossing to get his breath back.

          We see the train moving behind him.

          MEXICAN BAR - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          A Mexican bar, where Hector is a regular. The first shot shows two

          hands playing the harp. Then we get a larger shot and we see

          Hector and Bill talking together. Bill is carrying his jacket on

          his arm, and Hector is wearing his necktie very loose.

           There is quite a crowd in the bar, some people dancing, others

          drinking and some are seated to eat. Electric lines with colored

          bulbs are hung in the trees. In the back, the orchestra keeps on

          playing.

                          HECTOR

           I told you to stay the fuck out of it... Hey !

          He kisses a passing Mexican woman.

           ? Como esta? Gracias.

                          BILL

           I almost killed somebody out there. I mean, I had that car

           wedged right on the railroad tracks. Christ, man. It's a

           spooky feeling.

                          HECTOR

           Like mainlining adrenalin, huh ? The rush is really

           something, huh ? See ? You're my kind of guy !

          He takes him by the shoulders. They walk out of the field, and we

          see kids hitting a puppet hanging from a tree with a bat. The

          puppet is dressed in a cop's costume !

          Hector and Bill come to the buffet table.

                          HECTOR

          He gets a notebook from his pocket.

           You want to hear what I found out about your famous Monday

           group ?

                          BILL

           Yeah, sure. Can stand a little more pain.

          He takes a plate and starts helping himself at the buffet.

                          HECTOR

          He takes a tray and starts reading. A woman is serving him from

          the buffet.

           Well, Clark's wife divorced him... after he put her in

           intensive care.

                          BILL

           What'd she do ? Spill some wine on the rug ?

                          HECTOR

           Then Sondra, she stabbed her father with a knife... and a

           fork. She must have been having dinner. One of her husbands

           died of unnatural causes.

                          BILL

           Probably lost some body fluids.

                          HECTOR

           And that, that kid Richie. That Richie's been busted for

           drugs... and Casey hates his father so much... he set the

           house on fire. So what do you think of that ?

                          BILL

           I think it's good. They should learn to assert themselves.

          A very bright light, coming from above, suddenly shines on the

          bar. Hector and Bill raises their heads. We hear the engine of a

          helicopter and a voice coming from a loudspeaker.

                          THE VOICE

           Hey, the house is surrounded. Come out with your hands up

           and your legs spread !

                          HECTOR

           What the hell is this ?

          We see the helicopter and its powerful floodlight.

                          THE VOICE

           Happy birthday, Hector ! Hey, Martinez, come on out ! We

           got something for you !

          We get a better view of the helicopter. The word police is

          written on its fuselage. Two uniformed cops are standing on the

          right skid. One has a megaphone.

           VOICES OF THE COPS

           Martinez, happy birthday, man !... Happy birthday !

          The crowd starts singing, accompanied by the Mexican orchestra.

                          THE CROWD

           For he's a jolly good fellow ! For he's a jolly good

           fellow ! Which nobody can deny ! Which nobody can deny !

          Bill and Hector come in front of the crowd, and look up.

           For he's a jolly good fellow ! For he's a jolly good... !

          People yell and whistle.

          One of the cops standing on the right skid is a woman. She gets

          her pants down and shows her buttocks to the crowd. Another cop,

          on the other skid, has another megaphone.

           People scream when they see the female cop's buttocks.

                          BILL

           If I had known it was your birthday, I'd have come by

           tomorrow.

                          HECTOR

           Me too.

          The helicopter flies away.

           Large shot on the orchestra singing.

                          ORCHESTRA

           Estas son las mananitas. Que cantaba el Rey David.

          In a corner of the bar, Bill and Hector are eating quietly.

          Thunder rumbles and the first drops of rain start falling. The two

          men get up to find a shelter.

                          HECTOR

           Oy. Oigan, ivengan a buscar el cake ! Better get your cake.

           Ivengan a buscar el cake !

          People stop dancing and run to find a shelter.

                          A MAN

           Everybody inside !

                          BILL

           How come you didn't mention Buck ?

                          HECTOR

           There wasn't anything on him.

          BUCK'S RESIDENCE - STREET IN FRONT OF HOUSE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          It's raining. Bill drives with lights on and roof closed. On the

          side of the car, we can see the dents from the chase with the red

          car. Bill stops in front of a big vehicle. He switches off the car

          lights, gets out of the car, and pulls the collar of his jacket

          up. He stops near a car parked in front of Buck's house. He goes

          round the vehicle. There is a bullet hole in the windshield. Bill

          touches the bullet hole. He then walks toward the house, and stops

          in front of the open garage door. Inside is a red car. Bill enters

          the garage to have a better look at the car. When he gets up after

          inspecting the car, we see Buck standing behind him. Bill turns

          around. Buck has a gun in his hand.

                          BUCK

           You caught me at a bad time.

                          BILL

           Can we get in out of the rain?

          Slowly Buck starts walking toward the inside of the house. Bill

          starts walking too in front of Buck. They enter the house.

          BUCK'S RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          They get inside the house, which is lit only by the street lights

          and a unique lamp above the desk.

           Typical bachelor's place. Very messy. The furniture is simple and

          practical.

           We hear the storm rumbling in the distance.

                          BUCK

           Have a seat.

          Buck gets into the bathroom, the door of which is wide open, and

          grabs a towel. He dries himself and throw the towel to Bill. Bill

          sits down. Buck sits down on an armchair covered with a tartan

          rug. Bill dries his face. He looks at the gun, still in Buck's

          hand.

                          BILL

           I don't like guns.

          Buck shoves angrily the gun between the armrest and the cushion of

          his seat. He lies back in his armchair which rocks a little. Bill

          takes his jacket off.

           A lightning floods the room with a very bright light. Buck puts

          his hands on his face. He moans.

                          BUCK

           Oh, shit !

                          BILL

           Was it raining like this that night ?

                          BUCK

           Yeah. We were drivin'... me, my wife, my daughter. This guy

           comes out wavin', "Stop!" So I slow down. My wife said,

           "No, not here, Buck. It's a bad neighborhood. Besides, the

           baby's asleep in the back." And I said, "Bad neighborhood,

           nothing." So I stopped. Never even made it to the other

           car. I could hear the shots being fired, but my eyes

           wouldn't open. L...

          Another lightning. Buck puts his hands on his head.

           Oh, man ! The rain brought me around. This heavy, heavy

           rain. And I'm on the sidewalk, and I crawl over... and pull

           my way up and... There are two lateral shots... to the head

           for my wife... and a single shot through the heart for my

           daughter. Oh, Jesus, God ! Oh, Jesus. They got, uh... They

           got $31. The rain nails me every time, man.

                          BILL

           Did they ever find out who did it ?

                          BUCK

           No. I think it was some kind of payback for something. But

           that's a long story.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - GARAGE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          The rain has stopped, but the ground is still wet. The garage door

          opens slowly and Bob's car enters the garage. The roof is still

          closed. Bill is on the phone.

          MAIN POLICE STATION - INTERIOR NIGHT

          A telephone rings in an empty office, separated by a glass

          partition from the corridor. The door is open and Anderson comes

          running in, with a ready-cooked dish in his hand. He picks up the

          phone.

                          ANDERSON

           Officer Anderson. What can I do for you?

                          BILL'S VOICE

           It's Dr. Bill Capa. Remember me ?

          Low-angle shot of the office, showing the high ceiling, with a

          vintage decoration, contrasting with the modern and functional

          furniture.

                          ANDERSON

           Oh, yeah, yeah. The Bob Moore murder case.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - INSIDE CAR - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          The car has stopped but Bill still holds the phone.

                          BILL

           I need to talk to you.

          MAIN POLICE STATION - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Same low-angle shot.

                          ANDERSON

           I hope you're an early riser. I get off at 6:00.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - INSIDE CAR - EXTERIOR NIGHT

                          BILL

           Okay.

          He puts the phone down, gets his car keys and his jacket, and

          leaves the car.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - GARDEN - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          Bill gets out of the car and seems very intrigued by the fact that

          the keyhole-shaped door is open. He shuts his car door, and walks

          quietly toward the house. He looks around him in the garden,

          seeming more and more anxious. Finally, he enters the house.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Still anxious, Bill walks along the corridor.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Bill enters the kitchen. A lot of cooking ingredients scattered on

          the table. A noise makes Bill turn around. Rose, who was kneeling

          behind the table, stands up. She smiles when she sees Bill.

                          ROSE

           Hey.

          She snickers. The only piece of clothing she is wearing is a hotel

          room-maid white apron.

           Busy day ? Can I get you something ?

          Bill doesn't react at all. He looks shocked.

           No ? Okay.

          She crosses the room to get something in a drawer, showing her

          naked buttocks. All of a sudden, she seems to remember she is

          naked and put the two square fireproof cloths she is holding on

          her buttocks.

           Oh! I forgot about that !

          She laughs then comes back to the stove, where she moves a dish.

           Bill's face still looks very shocked.

                          BILL

           How did you get in here ?

                          ROSE

           Last time I was here, I stole the key. It was by the door.

                          BILL

           What about the alarm ?

                          ROSE

           Oh ! I never thought about that.

                          BILL

           It didn't go off ?

                          ROSE

           No. Um, did I make a mistake ? You have someone in the

           car ?

                          BILL

           No, goddamn it, there isn't someone in the car ! People are

           getting killed around here ! You walk around like it's

           goddamn Disneyland ! What if something were to happen to

           you ?

                          ROSE

          She seems not to understand Bill's anger.

           I just thought that it would be a nice surprise, that's

           all. You don't look too happy to see me.

                          BILL

          He waits a few second before he cools down.

           This is my happiness mode. I'm sorry.

                          ROSE

          She is crying. Bill comes to her and takes her in his arms.

           I'm sorry.

                          BILL

           I'm sorry. Baby, I'm sorry. This is a very nice surprise.

          He gives a quick look at her naked body. She laughs.

           Really nice. I'm sorry.

          They kiss.

                          ROSE

           I'll never take a risk like that again.

                          BILL

           Why don't you take the biggest risk of all and give me...

           your phone number.

                          ROSE

          She laughs and goes away from him and back to her cooking.

           Christ, Capa ! I can't have people tying up the phone

           lines. I'm trying to run a business here.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Bill, with his shirt completely open, eats spaghettis in front of

          a lighted candle. Rose also eats spaghettis, still dressed only in

          her white apron. Bill drinks from a glass of white wine. Rose

          bites into a asparagus in a slightly erotic way. Under the glass

          table, we can see Bill's naked foot stroking Rose's foot. With her

          other foot, Rose moves Bill's pants up. Rose slides down on her

          chair, so Bill can reach her feet with his hands. Then Rose slides

          completely out of her chair and under the table.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          A toy remote-controlled tank is moving on Rose's naked legs. The

          shot gets larger and we discover that Rose is in a bathtub full of

          foaming water.

                          BILL

          Voice over.

           General Patton comes out of the foothills.

          The tank moves on Rose's pubis, then on her stomach.

           Oh, he's in the swamp. Oh, oh, he's in the deep abyss.

          The tank skid on Rose's naked skin and doesn't succeed in climbing

          on her breast. We then see she is lying on her back on Bill's

          naked body, who is also lying on this back in the bathtub.

           Ooh! Ooh ! And now... Oh, he's having a problem. He's up in

           the Swiss Alps, ladies and gentlemen.

          They both laugh. We see Bill's hand holding the remote control.

           Fire one. Fire... Oh !... A direct hit !

          The tank skids into the water and stops.

                          ROSE

          Voice ironically disappointed.

           Oh.

                          BILL

           Oh, our, our tank fleet is crippled.

                          ROSE

           Yeah ?

                          BILL

           It's goin' away.

                          ROSE

          She turns around and we guess she is grabbing Bill's penis under

          water.

           How's the submarine fleet ?

                          BILL

           Hey, hey, hey, hey, please, please. I gotta get some sleep.

                          ROSE

          They kiss.

           Oh, you're chicken.

                          BILL

           I gotta be up...

                          ROSE

           You're chicken.

                          BILL

           I gotta be up at 6:00 in the morning.

                          ROSE

          She turns around to kiss him.

           You're chicken, chicken.

          LOS ANGELES CENTRAL MARKET - MARKET BUILDING - EXTERIOR DAY

          Tracking shot down a high glass building until it reaches the

          entrance of the Grand Central Market.

           We hear Anderson and Bill in voice over.

                          ANDERSON

           Nobody told me Buck was one of your patients.

                          BILL

           "Nobody," like Martinez ?

                          ANDERSON

           Right.

                          BILL

           That's the same "nobody" who didn't tell me Buck was a cop.

          The camera is now on street level and we see Bill and Anderson

          crossing the street towards the main gate of the market. They pass

          a truck delivering fresh meat.

                          ANDERSON

           Fucking Martinez. That's a can of worms you don't want to

           mess with.

                          BILL

           What about Buck ?

          They enter the market.

          LOS ANGELES CENTRAL MARKET - INSIDE THE MARKET - INTERIOR DAY

                          ANDERSON

           Hey, look, you gotta promise... if I tell you what I know

           about this shit, it stays between me and you. And you never

           heard it from me, okay ?

          They walk in the market alleyways. Anderson stops near a stall,

          and starts talking to a stall-holder we do not see.

           Two, Angelo.

                          BILL

           Why ?

                          ANDERSON

           Why ?

          Two uniformed cops are walking between the stalls. Anderson raises

          his voice to them.

           Because cops are vindictive sons of bitches. Right, Alex ?

          He throws a chicory to a cop, who catches it.

                          ALEX

           Right.

                          ANDERSON

          The cops are gone away. Anderson lowers his voice.

           Fucking asshole. I don't want to spend the rest of my

           career getting pissed on from above, okay ?

                          BILL

           Okay.

                          ANDERSON

          He laughs nervously.

           Martinez was nailin' Buck's wife.

                          BILL

           Holy shit.

                          ANDERSON

           Yeah. Both these guys were in narcotics. And those guys

           usually stick together like shit on a shirt... so who knows

           how long it's been going on. Anyway, one day, it came out.

           In the station, they had this big fight in front of

           everybody.

          Anderson takes two little wrapped packages from the unseen stall-

          holder and gives one to Bill.

           Two days later, Buck's wife gets blown away.

                          BILL

          He follow Anderson between the stalls.

           Jesus Christ ! Was there an investigation ?

                          ANDERSON

           Of course there was an investigation. Martinez was a

           suspect. Buck was a suspect. I mean nobody figured Buck

           forgiving her. For a while, half the station was a suspect.

                          BILL

           What do you think ?

                          ANDERSON

           I think Buck and Martinez had a lot of enemies on the

           street. This was just payback

           for both of 'em.

          They have come to a fishmonger stall. The fishmonger wraps a fish

          for Anderson.

          CASEY'S LOFT - INTERIOR DAY

          Casey is lying on an exercise bench and lifting weight with a

          pulleys and cables device.

           The phone rings. Casey doesn't move.

           CASEY'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE

           Hi, this is Casey. Can't get to the phone right now, but

           please leave a message.

          A beep, then Bill's voice.

           BILL'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE

           Casey, it's Bill Capa. I got your message and, sure, I can

           make it today. Are you there ?

          A hand appears holding a leather collar, which the hand wraps

          around Casey's neck.

                          CASEY

           Hey !... What... What the hell are you doing here ?

           BILL'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE

           Hello ? Listen, Casey, y-you sounded a little upset. Just

           hang in there, okay ?

                          CASEY

           Let me get this, huh ? No ?

           BILL'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE

           I'll be by this morning. So I'll see you in 30.

                          CASEY

           Well, you think you can do it in 30 ?

          He snickers while the hand tighten the collar around his neck.

          CASEY'S LOFT - PARKING IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING - EXTERIOR DAY

          Bob's car stops in front of the building. Bill, wearing

          sunglasses, gets out of the car and walks toward a three-story,

          impressive but a bit dilapidated, brick building. Evidently, it is

          an old workshop changed into an artist's loft. We can still read

          Nate Starkman & Son on the front of the building.

           Bill comes to a large metallic door and presses on an intercom

          button. No answer. He tries again. He raises his head to the above

          windows. No one. He walks a few steps back to get a better view of

          the building.

                          BILL

          He yells.

           Casey !

          CASEY'S LOFT - INTERIOR DAY

          Casey is still lying on his exercise bench. Both his hands are

          tied to the weight-lifting device, and his mouth is gagged. He

          groans through the gag.

          CASEY'S LOFT - PARKING - EXTERIOR DAY

                          BILL

          He puts his hands around his mouth to make his voice louder.

           Casey !

          He comes back to the door and presses the intercom button several

          times. He raises his eyes and notice a folded fire-exit ladder. He

          test the strength of the folding gate pulled in front of one of

          the doors. It seems strong enough for him to climb it. He reaches

          the ladder, which he brings down.

          CASEY'S LOFT - ROOF OF THE BUILDING - EXTERIOR DAY

          Bill is now on the roof of the building. He jumps down in a sort

          of yard, in which are scattered various objects : plants, modern

          furnitures and a full-size very realistic plastic sculpture of a

          cow. Bill remains crouched a few second, pats the cow's snout,

          stands up and walks towards a glass wall located on one side of

          the yard. He notices he is above Casey's workshop. He walks along

          the glass wall to a closed window, from which smoke is coming out.

                          BILL

           Oh, Jesus Christ.

          Bill succeeds in forcing the window open. A big cloud of smoke

          gets out of it.

           Casey ! Hey !

          He walks through the open window.

           Casey!

          CASEY'S LOFT - INTERIOR DAY

          Bill walks on the upper gallery, coughing with the smoke. He takes

          off his sunglasses. Down he sees flames around the mantlepiece. He

          gets very quickly down the steps to ground level.

           He goes to the mantlepiece. What looks like pieces of paper are

          burning on the floor around the mantlepiece. He first tries to put

          the flames out with his foot, then he takes a small shovel and

          shovel the flaming papers back into the mantlepiece.

           A curtain suddenly opens on the glass wall above the workshop,

          flooding the room with bright light.

           Bill walks to the center of the room, and notice that paintings

          have been lacerated. On each one, it is the face of a red-hair

          woman which has been taken away. Bill runs back to the

          mantlepiece, where he picks up a piece of what he first thought

          was a piece of paper, but which is actually a piece of canvas from

          the paintings. On the half-burned piece of canvas, the face of a

          woman, who is heavily made up but looks slightly like Rose.

           He puts the piece of canvas down, and notice a slimy liquid on

          the floor. He turns around to try to find out more about this

          slimy liquid.

           He pulls a rope and the painting, hooked on an horizontal cable

          line, start moving toward him. Behind the paintings, hooked on the

          same cable, comes Casey's body, hanging upside down. He looks dead

          and sill have the gag on this mouth. The half-naked body is

          covered with graffitis. The slimy liquid on the floor is Casey's

          blood.

                          BILL

           Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! Shit !

          Suddenly the blood, which was grey seen through Bill's eyes, turns

          red.

          A ROAD - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          Sondra's car. Sondra is driving. Rose is on the passenger seat,

          with her Bonnie's hairdo and make-up. The car radio is playing a

          song.

                          ROSE

           I love this song.

                          SONDRA

           I know.

          Honking. Two thirty-year old men, in an open convertible red car.

           THE RED CAR PASSENGER

           You girls want to go dancing ?

           THE RED CAR DRIVER

           Yeah. We're going to a party.

                          SONDRA

           Hi ! Hi !...

          Rose bends over Sondra and kisses her tenderly.

           THE RED CAR PASSENGER

           Well, pardon me !

          The two men look disappointed. Their car speeds up and goes away.

          The two women start laughing. Rose stands up through the open roof

          of the car. She waves to the passing cars. She then sits down and

          moves tenderly very close to Sondra.

                          SONDRA

           What are you doing ?

          Rose takes Sondra's hand and guide it under her skirt toward her

          crotch.

           Wha... No!

          Sondra bursts laughing and takes her hand away. Rose keeps on

          cuddling Sondra who tries to concentrate on her driving.

           Don't ! Don't !

          SONDRA'S RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Music from preceding scene has gone on without interruption. The

          two girls are dancing in front of the mirror. Sondra is wearing a

          tight-fitting black dress and Rose a skirt and a short top which

          shows her belly.

                          SONG WORDS

           Out all night Lady did. When nobody else would. Lady did

           And she did it real good. Once was not enough.

                          SONDRA

           Ah !

                          ROSE

           Sondra, go !

                          SONG WORDS

           Tell me, Katie What would your mama say.

                          SONDRA

           Oh, I'm gonna go change the music.

          While Sondra moves away to change the music, Rose goes to the

          window. In the house across the street, she sees a couple kissing.

          The music stops.

                          ROSE

           Sondra, come here. Oh, come here. My God !

                          SONDRA

          She comes near Rose.

           Oh, my God !

                          ROSE

           These are your neighbors !

                          SONDRA

           They do this all the time.

                          SONDRA

           Oh, wait. Watch, watch! No!

                          ROSE

          She bends down under the window sill and get Sondra down too.

           They're gonna see you !

          They get up and keep on watching.

                          SONDRA

           Oh, I don't believe it !

                          ROSE

           Oh, this is the part ! This is the part !

                          SONDRA

           Oh, my gosh !

                          ROSE

           Oh !

                          SONDRA

           Believe me, they can fuck.

          They laugh.

           Oh, I can't watch this anymore. I didn't see anything.

                          ROSE

           Oh, Sondra, go. I love this song.

                          SONDRA

           Yeah.

          The two girls start cuddling each other. Sondra strokes Rose's

          naked stomach, then her face.

           Close-up on the mirror, which shows the fire in the mantelpiece,

          between the girls legs.

                          ROSE

           Sondra, through the window ! Look ! Look !

          The camera remains on the mirror, which shows the two girls

          climbing on the bed to get a better look.

                          SONDRA

           Oh, what are they doing now ?

                          ROSE

           I can't tell.

                          SONDRA

           Are they gonna do it ? No !

          We see the couple in the house across the street. She is only

          wearing panties and her breast is naked. He is only wearing his

          trunks. They flirt on the couch.

                          ROSE

           My God ! It's gonna happen right now.

          Back to the mirror shot. The two girls, still standing up, are

          slapping each other buttocks. Rose raises Sondra's dress.

                          SONDRA

           Ow !

                          ROSE

           Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

          She sits on the bed and picks up a champagne glass.

           Oh, champagne.

          Sondra comes and sits next to her. Rose gives her her glass.

          Sondra drinks.

                          SONDRA

           Mmm.

          Sondra gives the glass back to Rose, who puts it on a furniture.

          The two faces come very close, and the two girls start exchanging

          tender little kisses. Then Rose moves Sondra's dress down and

          takes her own top off, showing her breast. Sondra seems very moved

          by what she sees. She strokes Rose's face. Their lips are getting

          very close.

           We see Sondra's hand going down Rose's back, and slipping under

          the top of her skirt, showing her buttocks. We see the tattooed

          rose.

                          ROSE

          She moves her face away from Sondra.

           No, no, Sondra. I can't. I can't.

                          SONDRA

           Why ? It's wonderful.

                          ROSE

           Sondra, I'm a jinx.

                          SONDRA

           No. We can cancel each other out.

                          ROSE

          She sobs a little.

           No. I'm not who you think I am. Oh, God, I'm in love with

           somebody and it's all falling apart. I'm sorry.

                          SONDRA

           Look, the sky isn't falling down.

                          ROSE

           Yes, it is.

                          SONDRA

           No. Let's get that silly thing off your head. There. I love

           your brown hair.

          She strokes her hair.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - INTERIOR DAY

          Bill sleeps on a leather couch, dressed with a western-style shirt

          and jeans. There is a gun on the low table near his head. We hear

          a buzz. Bill wakes up, gets up and looks at the security TV set.

          He takes the remote control to change the camera.

                          BILL

           Who is it ?

          After two unsuccessful pictures, Rose appears on the screen. She

          is wearing very short pants, a flowered blouse knotted under her

          breast and a small backpack.

                          ROSE'S VOICE

           I'm back.

          Bill opens the gate and looks through the window at Rose crossing

          the garden.

                          BILL

           Here she comes. Wearing a backpack on her back... making

           her look even younger than she is.

          Rose enters the room, puts her backpack down and falls in Bill's

          arms.

           She falls into his arms. And they kiss.

          They kiss.

                          ROSE

           Oh, God. I'm so glad that you're here. I didn't know if

           you'd be in.

                          BILL

           I don't have to be anywhere until this evening.

                          ROSE

           Yeah ?

          She opens her blouse. She doesn't wear a bra and her nipple

          appears.

           So, what color are my nipples ?

          They both laugh. She covers and uncovers her nipple. They kiss

          tenderly.

                          ROSE

           Oh, God. To be normal like this all the time.

                          BILL

           Oh, God, this is better than normal. This is much better

           than normal. It's just driving me crazy, that's all. I

           mean, I don't really know you... who you are... what you

           do... if you're safe, when you're coming by. You have all

           the power. I just sit around here and wait for you.

                          ROSE

          She cries.

           You do ?

                          BILL

           Yeah. I mean, other things happen, but... in the "what I

           wait for" department, you're it.

                          ROSE

           Oh, my.

          Time has elapsed. They are now seated next to each other. Bill is

          bare-chest and Rose is wearing one of Bill's denim shirts. They

          look at a photo album. Rose puts her finger on the pictures and

          Bill tells her who it is.

                          BILL

           Bob's wife. My ex-wife.

                          ROSE

           She's pretty.

                          BILL

           Pretty fucked up.

          Rose flips the page. A picture of Bob.

           Oh, God. I forget that he's dead.

          She kisses him tenderly to comfort him.

                          ROSE

          She flips the page.

           He looks so young here. God, how long ago were these

           taken ?

                          BILL

           Ten years ago.

                          ROSE

           Really ? Do you have anything more recent ?

                          BILL

           Maybe. Hold on.

          He gets up and goes to the shelves. He start looking for another

          album.

           I don't know why he kept this hidden back here except

           maybe... because it had a picture of his wife naked, which

           leads me to believe that... the relationship wasn't as dead

           as they were pretending.

          He sits back next to Rose, and start looking at the new album.

           I don't know who these people are.

                          ROSE

          She seems very worried all of a sudden.

           No. It's morbid. I don't want to see anymore. Let's go

           outside. Let's pretend it's Sunday. Yeah? You wanna?

          Bill looks at her, a bit disconcerted by her unexpected reaction.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - GARDEN - EXTERIOR DAY

          We hear the birds chirping. By the poolside, Bill is lying on his

          back on a mattress. He is wearing sunglasses, and is naked except

          for a white towel spread on his pelvis. Rose is lying on her

          stomach, head to foot with Bill. She is naked but is wearing one

          thick woolen sock on one foot.

                          BILL

           One of my patients was killed last night. He was murdered.

                          ROSE

          She seems very disturbed by the news.

           What ?

                          BILL

           The painter. Casey.

                          ROSE

          She has tears in her eyes.

           Were you there ?

                          BILL

           A little bit after.

                          ROSE

           What did you see ?

                          BILL

           You don't want to know.

          He takes off his sunglasses and start getting up, covering his

          crotch with the towel.

           About a half hour before group. I'm gonna get a shower. You

           gonna be okay out here ?

                          ROSE

           Yeah.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Bill enters the bathroom and turn the shower faucet on. Then he

          gets out of the room.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Bill takes a pair of jeans in the closet and puts it on, without

          underwear.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Rose has dressed up. She enters the room and goes directly to the

          shelf where the photo album was hidden. She gets it and starts

          turning the pages.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - UPPER GALLERY - INTERIOR DAY

          Bill comes out of the dressing room, and into a gallery above the

          sitting room. He sees Rose looking through the album, taking a

          picture out of the album and then putting the album back where it

          was. He hides behind a wall for her not to see him. She is looking

          inside a photo-lab envelope. Bill comes out of his hiding.

                          BILL

           Rose.

                          ROSE

          She jumps.

           Oh ! Oh !

          She drops the envelope, picks up her backpack and runs out of the

          room.

                          BILL

           Rose ! Rose !

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - GARDEN - EXTERIOR DAY

          Rose runs to the keyhole-shaped door. The gate opens and Rose runs

          out.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Bill runs down the stair from the upper gallery. He is bare chest

          with his shirt in his hand.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - ROAD IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE - EXTERIOR DAY

          Rose gets out of the residence and runs to her car, a small ORV.

          She climbs in and starts very fast. Bill gets out of the house.

                          BILL

          He jumps into his car without opening the door.

           Rose ! Jesus !

          Bob's car get's out of the residence.

          MAIN ROAD, THEN CITY STREETS - EXTERIOR DAY

          We see Bill driving his car. He chases Rose, whom we then see in

          her car. Tires screech with the high speed driving. Bill comes

          closer to Rose and tries to memorize her license plate numbers.

                          BILL

           2ASB... 185...

          The chase goes on. Rose drives very recklessly, Bill too. He

          drives through the cross roads without slowing down.

           A man, who was seated on a low wall, has to climb on it to avoid

          Bill's car, which is driving on the sidewalk. Bill stops near him.

          We hear the voice of an angry woman.

           VOICE OF THE ANGRY WOMAN

           Oh ! Stupid, crazy bastard ! They'll give anybody a

           license !

          BOB'S OFFICE - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Outside, night has fallen and it is raining.

                          CLARK

          He is very smartly dressed, and even wears a bow tie. He counts

          the books on the shelves.

           Five and six are 31. Seven, seven, that makes 45. And that

           will remain 45, and every single time you count it, it will

           be 45, no matter what. And then this is five, and that

           makes 50. And nine is 59. Now that's odd. That's really

           odd. Now there's 59 again.

                          BILL

          He has just come into the room.

           What ?

                          CLARK

           Well, last week... there were 58 books on the bookshelf

           where there is always... and I mean always, 59 books, and

           this week there are 59 again, so I don't...

                          BILL

          He turns toward Sondra.

           Which one, Sondra ?

                          SONDRA

          She is very smartly dressed too, in a white suit with black

          collar. She sighs.

           I didn't read any of it. Really. I felt so bad when I got

           it home. I couldn't help myself.

                          BILL

          He moves rapidly to the shelves.

           Which one, Sondra ?

                          SONDRA

           It... The Van Gogh. But I didn't read any of it. Honestly,

           I promise !

          Bill takes the book and moves away from the shelves. Sondra signs

          menacingly to Clark.

                          CLARK

           What did I do ?

          Bill has seated himself, and he looks through the book. Sondra

          tries to read above his shoulder. Close-up of the book. It is

          Bob's diary. Close-up on one paragraph. We hear Bob's voice

          reading the paragraph.

                          BOB'S VOICE

           I was right about the threats from the Monday group. This

           cycle of pain. Yesterday's victim becomes tomorrow's

           monster. Today's the day.

          Buck enters the room.

                          BILL

           Hi.

          Buck starts closing the door, but Richie comes in.

                          BUCK

           Hi, Bill.

                          BILL

           Hi, Buck.

          Buck sits down.

           Casey, uh... is not gonna be joining us tonight, so I think

           we should get started.

                          BUCK

           That's typical.

          Thunder rumbles. Buck puts his hands on his head. Richie looks at

          him.

           Oh, shit!

                          CLARK

           Buck, are you all right ?

                          BUCK

           It's none of your fucking business.

                          SONDRA

           You know, I can't stand this arguing. Really.

                          CLARK

           I'd like to start, if I may. I'd like to apologize to the

           group and Sondra.

          While he is talking, Bill keeps on looking through his friend's

          diary. A photo is stuck between two pages. It is a photo of Rose

          naked.

           Everything that you said last week in group was right, and

           that's why I lost my temper. Uh, the young lady that I

           mentioned last week... that relationship has been

           terminated. No reason and no hope. She just, just called...

           and told me, and that's it.

                          BILL

          He reads what is written on the back of the photo.

           "The sociopath, lacking the restraints that... hold a

           normal character together, can become anything. Amorality

           frees her to be universally perfect. A charming chameleon

           with a scorpion's tail." Do any of you recognize...

           recognize this woman ?

          He gives the photo to Sondra.

                          SONDRA

          She laughs and brings the picture to her chest.

           Oh, my God ! Oh ! This is my girlfriend. This is Bonnie.

                          BUCK

          He tears the picture away from her hands.

           Give me that !

          He looks at the picture and turns to her.

           This your Bonnie ? This is your Bonnie ? Yeah ?

                          SONDRA

           Yeah. Yeah.

                          BUCK

           The one you've been boring the living shit out of us with ?

           This is the one that's saving you from yourself ? Your

           shopping mall hag ?

                          SONDRA

           Shut up.

                          BUCK

           The one that makes you smile ?

                          SONDRA

           Shut up !

                          BUCK

           The one that you wish was a man ?

                          SONDRA

           What are you getting at, Buck ?

                          BUCK

           That Bonnie ? Is that it ?

                          SONDRA

           That's right, that's it. That's right, That's right.

                          BUCK

           Sondra... this is my Bonnie.

                          SONDRA

          She bursts laughing, but she has tears in her eyes.

           You're lying. You're lying. You're lying. You're lying ! I

           don't believe you !

          Bill looks intensely at her. Sondra has started sobbing.

                          CLARK

          He tears the picture away from Buck's hands.

           Let me see that.

                          BUCK

          He puts his head in his hands.

           Fuckin' A !

                          CLARK

          He looks at the picture.

           Well, yes, of course. This is the woman that I've been

           talking about. This is my Bonnie.

          Buck tears the picture away from his hands.

           Goddamn it, Buck ! Don't do that ! Do not do that !

                          BUCK

           Hey, hey, hey !

          They are ready to fight. Sondra comes between them. The three of

          them are talking together.

                          SONDRA

           You're lying to me ! Why are you lying to me ?

                          CLARK

           Stop acting like an... Like an emotional child !

                          BUCK

           Goddamn tar baby !

                          SONDRA

           You're making it up ! You're making it up !

                          CLARK

           Nobody's making anything up... and stop it, stop it, stop

           it !

          During this heated verbal exchange, Richie has picked the fallen

          picture from the floor.

                          SONDRA

           Stop it !

                          CLARK

           Quit it ! You're crumpling the picture up ! I want you to

           stop showing off ! You're a little brat !

                          BUCK

           Fuck it ! You have the emotions of a styrofoam cup !

          We see Richie putting the picture away and leaving hurriedly.

                          CLARK

           You calm down, and you stop...

                          SONDRA

           Where's the picture ?

          Lightning, thunder, and the pictures appears close-up in a hand.

          It is Hector's hand, who looks at them all, sneering.

                          HECTOR

           How in the name of God... could all of you be going out

           with the same woman and not know ? Not have a clue ?

           Including you, Mr. Psycho-fucking-analyst ? Not to mention

           Bob Moore... who probably took this amazing picture himself

           in front of his expensive painting. I'm gonna call the

           Guinness Book of World Records... because I think this

           woman deserves credit. And I'm gonna make sure that all of

           your names are included... so you can all share in the

           glory.

                          BILL

           Well, you should know something about sharing, huh,

           Hector ? I mean, you and Buck must have shared some very

           tender moments... discussing his wife. Huh ? Why didn't you

           tell me the truth ?

                          HECTOR

           What truth is that ?

                          BILL

           Why didn't you tell me Buck was a cop... not to mention a

           suspect in a murder case ? Not to mention you, goddamn it.

                          HECTOR

           Because... I'm not your patient, and I don't have to tell

           you shit !

                          BILL

          He jumps on Hector. Bucks tries to take them apart.

           That's right, you don't have to tell me shit ! Fuckin' tell

           me anything, do you ? Why won't somebody tell me some

           fucking truth ?

                          BUCK

          He has succeeded in taking them apart.

           Get the fuck out of here !

                          BILL

           One fuckin' thing ! Can you do that, Buck ?

                          HECTOR

           You really know how to pick your women, you know that ?

                          BILL

           I know you can't... you lyin' sack of shit !

          He wants to jump again on Hector. Buck holds him back.

           You can't fuckin' do it !

                          BUCK

           Listen. After my wife died, I wanted to slaughter this

           cock-sucker !

                          SONDRA

           Don't ! No more !

                          BUCK

           But I realized we both loved her. It became a, sort of a

           bond between us. Isn't that right, Hector ? Isn't it ?

           Hector ! Jesus God ! I never got the chance to forgive her.

           So I forgave him instead.

                          HECTOR

           All right ! So much for the famous fucking Monday group !

           Now we have a suspect with a tattoo on her ass and no

           address. Now the cops need your help. What about the car ?

           Anybody around here wrote down the license plates numbers ?

                          BUCK

           "The license plates numbers" ?

                          SONDRA

           We didn't even...

                          HECTOR

           Huh ?

          Bill looks at Hector, but says nothing.

                          SONDRA

           Well, I didn't think to-to-to write it down.

          PALACE HOTEL - HALL - INTERIOR DAY

          Revolving door of the entrance of the hotel. People are coming

          incessantly in and out. Among them we see Bill coming in. The

          following dialogue is in voice over on the shot of the revolving

          door.

                          HOTEL ATTENDANT

           Hey, welcome back to L.A., Miss Brown.

           HOTEL FEMALE GUEST

           Thanks. Put my bags in my room.

                          BILL

           Dr. Ashland from New York with the psychiatric convention.

                          HOTEL ATTENDANT

           Dr. Ashland ? In the health club.

          HOTEL FITNESS CENTER - INTERIOR DAY

          Larry, dressed in tracksuit, is working with one of the fitness

          devices. Bill is standing in front of him.

                          BILL

           I don't think she is a sociopath.

                          LARRY

           Well, then how about something simple and snappy like a

           multiple personality disorder ? You've fallen into a trap.

           You are not well. She is not well. And to you, Iit feels

           like a bond.

          He gets up and starts walking in the room. Bill follow him.

                          BILL

           She's been acting this thing out as if... it's the only way

           for her to have a life.

                          LARRY

           Or lives.

          HOTEL SWIMMING POOL - INTERIOR DAY

          Larry is sitting in a whirlpool. Hot water is bubbling all around

          him. Bill is seated by the pool side.

                          LARRY

           You really want to go on seeing her, do you ?

                          BILL

           Yes, I want to see her.

                          LARRY

           In a, a nonprofessional sense ?

                          BILL

           In every sense.

                          LARRY

           I don't have your magical tuning fork. All I know is that

           two people are dead... and she seems an excellent suspect.

           Bill, salmon swim upstream to mate and die. And so do men.

                          BILL

           Is that what I'm doing?

          A STREET NEAR THE MAIN POLICE STATION - EXTERIOR DAY

          Anderson is walking in the street, a coffee paper cup in his hand.

          He is wearing suit and sunglasses, but also a very flashy necktie.

          Bill dressed in open shirt and sunglasses, walks toward him.

                          BILL

           Anderson ! I need your help with something.

                          ANDERSON

           Hey, man, how ya doin'?

          They start walking together in the street.

                          BILL

           I'm sitting in a restaurant last night, and I'm looking out

           the window... watching this woman trying to back out of a

           space right in front of mine.

                          ANDERSON

           A beautiful woman ?

                          BILL

           Stunning. Anyway, the next thing I know, she busted out the

           headlight on my car.

                          ANDERSON

           Uh-oh. Drives away, right ?

                          BILL

           I don't even think she knew what she did.

                          ANDERSON

           But you'd like to meet her ?

          Bill answers with a silly smile.

           All right, um, I'll see what I can do. You got the license

           number ?

                          BILL

          He gets a piece of paper out of his shirt pocket and gives it to

          Anderson.

           Yeah. Thanks, man. All right. Thanks.

                          ANDERSON

           Sure.

          The two men split up. Anderson walks into the police office.

          STREETS, THEN PARKING BUILDING IN L.A. - EXTERIOR DAY

          Bob's car, still dented all over, starts, with open roof, and Bill

          driving. He is wearing sunglasses.

           As the car passes a crossroad, we see, coming on its right , the

          red car, also dented all over. It starts following Bill.

           Bill parks his car on a parking lot, at the bottom of a parking

          building. The red car climbs to the roof of the building.

           Bill cuts the ignition off, takes his keys and gets out of the

          car. He starts walking along the building, the red car following

          him from the roof.

           The red car stops behind a car parked on the edge of the roof,

          then starts pushing the car. The car breaks the guardrail and

          falls down to the ground. Bill raises his head, sees the car

          coming down, jumps away and falls flat on the ground, just

          avoiding the falling car, which crashes on two other parked cars.

          We see the front of the red car appearing behind the broken

          guardrail. Bill bangs his fist on the ground, while pieces of

          broken cars are flying all around him.

                          BILL

          He yells.

           Damn !

          BUILDING WITH GALLERIES - EXTERIOR DAY

          A very picturesque building with multiple open air galleries. On

          one of the galleries, Anderson walks toward Hector who is pointing

          a menacing finger to him.

                          HECTOR

           I ought to shoot you!

                          ANDERSON

           I came to make amends.

                          HECTOR

           So make 'em, loudmouth !

          Full shot of the building. Very typical L.A. architecture, looking

          almost like a movie set. Anderson and Hector are leaning against

          the bannister of one of the upper galleries.

                          ANDERSON

           I just spoke to Bill Capa. This license plate might belong

           to our mystery lady.

          Close up on Anderson and Hector. Anderson gives to Hector the

          piece of paper Bill had given to him. Hector reads the paper.

          NIEDELMEYER'S RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY

          Bill runs to the door of the house. He knocks repeatedly and

          forcefully.

                          BILL

           Mrs. Niedelmeyer ! It's Dr. Capa again.

          Edith Niedelmeyer opens the small panel in the door. She looks

          furious.

                          EDITH

           You leave me alone ! Get away from here !

                          BILL

           I need your help, please !

                          EDITH

           Why are you torturing me like this ?

                          BILL

           Mrs. Niedelmeyer, please !

          NIEDELMEYER'S RESIDENCE - INTERIOR DAY

          Edith closes the small panel. Several heavy blows on the door,

          which eventually crashes open and gives access to Bill.

           The house is very heavily decorated.

                          BILL

           I need you to listen to me ! My best friend was killed. He

           was stabbed with a knife...

                          EDITH

           You get out of my house !

                          BILL

           ... 38 times in the chest !

                          EDITH

           You-You go away!

                          BILL

          He follows her through the sitting room. They arrive near a bay

          window, behind which we can see a large swimming pool.

           Another patient was bled to death ! I think that I might be

           next !

                          EDITH

           Go away !

                          BILL

           I don't have anywhere else to go, Mrs. Niedelmeyer ! What

           are you hiding from me ? What is it ?

                          EDITH

           Nothing.

                          BILL

          Why won't you tell me the truth ?

          Edith picks up a cordless phone on a table. Bill tears the phone

          away from her hands.

           Put that phone down.

                          EDITH

           I'm calling the police !

                          BILL

           Put the phone down ! Put the phone down !

                          EDITH

          She falls on the armchair in which Bill has pushed her.

           Please ! What kind of twisted creature are you ? I've never

           done anything to you.

                          BILL

           My patient Richie is involved...

                          EDITH

           Why in God's name are you doing this horrible joke ?

                          BILL

           If you just help me...

                          EDITH

           Richie Dexter is dead ! He killed himself four years ago.

                          BILL

           Why ?

                          EDITH

           Because he couldn't stand... what my husband was doing to

           him.

          She gets up goes to the window bay and open a glass door. She

          leans against the frame of the door.

           He hung himself with a belt. He was 12. I didn't know ! I

           mean, how could I know ? Nobody knew.

                          BILL

           What about the family ?

                          EDITH

           He is survived by his brother, Dale. If Richie Dexter were

           alive today... he'd be 16 years old. He also had a sister,

           Rose.

          Bill stands still for a few seconds. He has just understood the

          truth. Then he sighs and rushes out of the house. He runs near a

          impressive mantlepiece decorated with a fierce lion head pulling

          its tongue out.

          DALE'S WORKSHOP - PARKING - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          Bob's car arrives on the empty parking lot in front of Dale's

          workshop. The atmosphere is even more uncomfortable at night than

          during the day. Lightnings in the sky. There are lights evenly

          placed all along the high chimney. Several windows are lit on the

          first floor of the building.

           Bill parks the car in front of the building, gets out the car

          and runs toward the building. He enters using the door with the

          sign Beware of dog.

          DALE'S WORKSHOP - LIVING QUARTERS - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Bill gets in the living quarters of the Dexter. It is quite dark.

          In one corner, a large kitsch statue of Christ of the Sacred

          Heart. A sink with two cabinets with glass doors..

           Bill pushes the sliding door leading to the workshop.

          DALE'S WORKSHOP - WORKSHOP - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Bill walks between statues being worked on. He bumps into a small

          cage hanging from the ceiling.

           He opens a door which leads him into a small room covered with

          spiderwebs. Something liquid drops on his hand. It's blood. Bill

          raises his head.

           Though a gate in the ceiling, he sees the crying face of Richie.

           He gets out of the small room, takes a big piece of carved wood

          on a table, and climbs the steps leading to the upper parts of the

          workshop.

           When he arrives in the upper gallery, he menacingly waves the

          piece of wood, and walks very cautiously. Richie is seated with

          his back to him. He has blood on his T-shirt.

                          BILL

           Richie.

          He gets nearer and puts the piece of wood down.

           Jesus Christ !

          When he is close to Richie, he sees that his T-shirt is badly torn

          down and full of blood. He wants to touch it, but Richie starts

          moaning. Bill kneels near him.

           What did he... What did he do to you ?

                          RICHIE

          He can hardly talk, and stammers even more than usual.

           W-What I... d-deserved. Y-You shouldn't be here. Get away

           from me.

                          BILL

           Richie... Richie... I have to see Rose.

          He takes off Richie's glasses.

           I need her.

          He takes off Richie's wig, and Rose's face appears.

                          ROSE

          She has gone back to Rose's voice, and doesn't stammer anymore.

           Get away from me, please ! You'll make it worse !

                          BILL

           Where's Dale ?

                          ROSE

          She cries.

           L-I don't know, but he'll be back ! L-I don't know where he

           is.

                          BILL

          He is also crying.

           Was this your idea, to become Richie ?

                          ROSE

           No ! No ! L-It happened. It just happened.

                          BILL

           What? What happened, Rose ? Please. I need to know.

                          ROSE

           When Richie died... Dale buried the body and then he said,

           "Richie, come here." And I told him, I told him, "My name

           is Rose !" He slapped me so hard, I couldn't get up. A-And

           he, he made me dress in these clothes... and h-he did

           things to me that made me not want to be a woman anymore. I

           was Richie from then on.

                          BILL

           What happened to Rose ?

                          ROSE

           After a while, I forgot about Rose. Then Richie got busted.

                          BILL

           And you had to come to group.

                          ROSE

           They were our world. They were our family.

                          BILL

           But then what ? Rose started coming back ?

                          ROSE

           No! Rose, Rose was too scared, so Bonnie came out. Bonnie

           was first.

                          BILL

           Oh, honey.

                          ROSE

           Help me, please ! Help me.

          Rose moves her eyes down and Bill follows her eyes. He discovers

          that Rose's hand has been nailed to the carved armrest of the

          armchair.

                          BILL

           Jesus! Oh, my God !

          Bill stands up.

           Oh! Jesus Christ ! Jesus Christ !

          He goes to the table where he had dropped the piece of wood and

          start looking for an appropriate tool. He finds a big hammer.

           That crazy bastard !

          With the forked end of the hammer, he raises the nail.

                          ROSE

          She cries and yells.

           Oh, God !

          Bill gets the nail off. Rose can't breathe anymore. Her eyes are

          rolling upwards.

                          BILL

          He feels that she is going away from him.

           Rose !

                          ROSE

          She goes back to Richie's voice and face. She starts stammering

          again.

           Get away f-from me!

                          BILL

           Rose, come back ! Richie ! Richie, leave her alone !

                          ROSE

          Still talking like Richie.

           I never get to be out a-anymore.

                          BILL

           Rose. Come on.

                          ROSE

          Rose's head stands up : she is gone back being Rose.

           And then I met you and the fog... Started to lift.

          Bill takes off the other nail.

           It did. It did.

                          BILL

           I know. Come on, let's go.

          He helps her to stand up, and then to walk.

           Let's go. Here we go. Come on. Shh. Come here.

          They start going down to the workshop.

           Here we go. Here we go. Let's move.

          We hear the sound of a nail-gun, and a nail clicks on a piece of

          metal near them.

                          ROSE

           Oh !

          Several nail-gun shots. Nails are getting stuck in the various

          wooden objects around them.

                          DALE

          Shot from behind Dale. He holds a nail-gun and keeps on shooting

          nails.

           Back up!

          He sticks a nail in Bill's shirt. Bill remains nailed against a

          carved wooden panel.

                          ROSE

          She yells and holds Bill tightly.

           No ! No, Dale, don't !

                          BILL

           Get back ! Get back !

                          ROSE

           Dale, no !

                          DALE

           Quick tongue, slow wit. Deadly, Doctor.

          Bill tries to take the nail off. The nail must have gone through

          his flesh, because there is blood on his shirt.

           Deadly.

          Dale raises his nail-gun slowly, but Hector appears from behind a

          wall, holding a real gun.

                          HECTOR

           Hi, Dale. You fucking daffodil. Put that toy down. Put it

           in the toolbox. Now ! I got .45 caliber nails in this gun !

                          BILL

           What are you doing here, Martinez ?

                          HECTOR

          He talks to Bill who is behind him, but without taking his eyes

          away from Dale.

           Aren't you glad I'm here ? Anderson snitched you out !

           That's what happens when you try to outsmart a cop ! Let

           that be your psych lesson for the day !

          At the end of his sentence, Hector slightly turns his head toward

          Bill. Immediately Dale shoots him. Hector bends down a little

          because of the pain, and stands back up to shoot Dale. But Dale is

          faster than him and nails both of his hands against the wood

          panel.

                          HECTOR

          He yells.

           Go ! Run !

                          BILL

           Go ! Get over there ! Get over there !

                          ROSE

           No ! No !

          Dale keeps on shooting and sticks several nails in Hector's

          fingers.

                          HECTOR

           Go ! Run ! Run ! Run ! Run ! Go !

          Bill succeeds in getting the nail off his arm. He runs away with

          Rose.

           We follows them through the workshop. As they reach a staircase,

          we hear an engine starting. Then a whole block of shelves falls in

          front of them. We see Dale in a small glass cabin, his hands on

          the controls of a handling machine.

           Bill moves Rose away from him...

                          BILL

           Let's go!

          ... just as a huge piece of furniture falls on Bill, who falls

          down, stuck under the furniture.

                          ROSE

           No ! Get out !

          Dale appears behind Bill, and wraps a leather belt around his

          neck. He tightens the belt. Bill suffocates. Dale pulls him by the

          belt across the workshop.

                          DALE

           Come on ! Come on !

          He puts him inside a metal cage. He ties the belt on the top of

          the cage. Bill tries, with both hands to move the belt away from

          his throat.

                          BILL

           You fucking son of a bitch !

          Dale takes a small electric saw, switches it on and tests it on

          the bars of the cage. Sparks spring up.

           You really fucked it up, didn't ya ? Got your little

           brother killed.

                          DALE

           No !

                          BILL

           You let old Niedelmeyer do it to him.

                          DALE

           No, I saved him !

                          BILL

           You knew what was happening...

                          DALE

           I didn't know !

                          BILL

           Because it happened to you before !

                          DALE

           Would you goddamn shut up ?

                          BILL

           Could have saved your little brother, but he killed

           himself.

                          DALE

          He is getting angry.

           Shut up ! Shut the fuck up !

                          BILL

           You failed, Dale. And you made Rose become Richie !

                          DALE

          He calms down and smiles.

           Oh, you're smart. You're really smart. Bob Moore was smart,

           but I put a stop to that.

                          BILL

           Yeah, you did.

          He coughs.

           Why'd you kill Casey, Dale?

                          DALE

           Why are you head-shrinkers all alike, huh ? Y-You can't

           keep your fucking hands off of us. Huh ? Always pokin' and

           pushin'. Huh ?

          While talking, he keeps on switching his saw on and off.

                          BILL

           Why'd you do it, Dale ?

                          DALE

           Because... that little bitch, Rose, she started sneaking

           out... playing like Bonnie, modeling for him night after

           night. Christ, Bill, he was lookin' right through her...

           gonna recognize Richie in group. Well, I might have missed

           old Niedelmeyer... but I sure as hell got Bob... real good.

           - And now...

          He starts his saw. Sparks spring up on the edge of the cage.

           I'm gonna cut you into little pieces and sand the skin off.

                          BILL

          He snickers.

           The inspiration of madness, Dale.

                          DALE

           The tyranny of normalcy, Bill.

          He starts his saw again, and slowly moves it close to Bill. We

          hear the sound of the nail-gun and a nail gets stuck in Dale's

          shoulder. The saw stops. Dale walks back a few steps to face Rose,

          holding the nail-gun pointed on him.

                          DALE

           Richie.

                          ROSE

           My name is... My name is Rose.

          He rushes on her. She shoots and sticks a nail in the middle of

          his forehead. Dale falls down. Rose starts screaming.

           No ! No !

          Bill tries to get the belt off his neck. Rose raises the gun to

          her throat, and presses the trigger. But it doesn't work. She

          tries again. It still doesn't work. The gun must be empty.

           No !

          Bill eventually succeeds in getting free, but Rose, after she has

          thrown the gun away, starts running through the workshop.

           No !

                          BILL

          He runs after her.

           Rose ! Rose ! Come back ! Rose !

          DALE'S WORKSHOP - CHIMNEY - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          Rose starts climbing the ladder mounted on the body of the

          chimney. Bill follows her and yells.

                          BILL

           Rose ! Rose ! Stop ! Rose !

          Rain is soaking both of them, but they keep on climbing. Thunder

          is rumbling.

           A long distance shot shows the whole chimney, with Rose and Bill

          climbing on it.

           Wait ! Rose!

                          ROSE

          She sobs.

           Don't !

                          BILL

           For God's sakes, don't jump ! Rose !

                          ROSE

          She has reached the circular platform on the top of the chimney.

          She yells.

           No !

                          BILL

           Rose ! Stop !

                          BILL

          He reaches the platform.

           No ! No. No !

                          BILL

           Wait !

                          ROSE

           Why ?

                          BILL

           Rose ! No ! Stop, please !

          Rose jumps on the very narrow ring which circles the platform.

           Just stay there !

                          ROSE

           It's too late. I've gone too far. I can't go back.

                          BILL

           If you go, I go ! I swear to God ! I swear to God.

                          ROSE

           Why would you do that ?

                          BILL

           Please, God, just come over here. I don't want you to die.

           Just give me your hand. Take a risk ! There's no risk in

           dying. Come on.

                          ROSE

           Oh, Capa.

                          BILL

           Come on.

                          ROSE

          She puts her hand out to Bill's strutted hand. We hear the sound

          of a high gust of wind, and Rose looses her balance and starts

          falling backward.

           L... No...

                          BILL

           No !

                          ROSE

           Capa !

          She yells.

           No !

          Bill jumps from the platform and catches a chain hanging under the

          platform. His momentum makes him swing and he catches Rose's arm

          just as she was falling from the outer ring. With his other arm he

          holds on the chain and they start swinging back and forth. They

          eventually reach the chimney ladder. Rose grabs one of the rungs,

          followed by Bill, who pushes her up.

                          BILL

           Come on.

          They move back to the platform, and, as soon as they reach it,

          they hug each other very tight. Bill looks at the beacon on the

          top of the chimney. From white, the beacon becomes red, which is

          its real color. Bill smiles : he sees red again. He hugs Rose even

          more tightly.

                          HECTOR'S VOICE

          While the camera pans away from the platfom, showing the whole

          platform with Bill and Rose holding each other, we hear Hector's

          voice.

           Hey! Listen up, you fucking daffodils ! You gonna leave me

           hanging here all night, huh ?

          Bill starts laughing.

           Get me down, you goddamn cuckoos ! Get me some fucking

           Band-Aids !

          Bill keeps on laughing. Rose starts laughing too.

           Come on, you fucking daffodils ! Get me out of here !

                         CREDITS

          During the credits, we hear the following song :
