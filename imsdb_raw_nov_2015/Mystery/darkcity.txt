                            REVISED DRAFT

                         November 29th, 1992

     DARKNESS

     A LOW RUMBLE increases in volume.

     FADE UP:

     A BLACK-GLOVED HAND wraps around a bulky electrical lever,

     thrusts FORWARD.

     SNAP!  -  Electricity arcs through darkness.

     O.S. sound of MACHINERY turning ON.

     TITLES OVER

     MONTAGE OF CLOCKS starting  -  various.  Second hands turn  -

     TICKING gets louder.

     INT.  BATHROOM  -  NIGHT

     SHADOWS DANCE.  A bare bulb swings from the ceiling revealing:

     clothes on a chair, puddles of water on the floor...

     SLEEPING EYES in and out of darkness.  The eyes open.

     Confusion.

     WIDEN ANGLE ON JONATHAN WHITE  -  a man in his early thirties,

     dark featured.

     He sits up.  Water splashes.  He's in a tub of long cold water.

     His neck aches like he's been sleeping forever.

     He looks down into the murky water around him.  A feint

     movement beneath the surface, something swimming  -  A SMALL

     DARK SHAPE.  Startled, he leaps from the bath.

     ANGLE  -  THE SWINGING LIGHT BULB.  The man's hand reaches up,

     stops the light-bulb mid swing.

     He steps to a circular window.  The glass is cracked, covered

     in grime.  He wipes it, this only smears the dirt.

     It's dark out there.

     EXT.  BUILDING  -  NIGHT

     ANGLE ON WHITE  -  from outside the window, through blurry

     glass.

     A RAPID FLYING P.O.V. PULLS BACK in silence.  The window is a

     SPECK on the side of a vast grey tower.

     BACK IN THE BATHROOM

     White shivers, cold.  He stares down at the puddle he drips on

     the floor.  He looks at his feet and legs, covered with

     numerous SMALL BITES.  He dries the bloody wounds with a towel.

     He picks up the clothes lying on the chair, puts them on.

     Loose trousers with braces, a plain shirt, leathers shoes with

     HOLES in both soles.  In his trouser pocket he finds a key  -

     a room number on a plastic tag.

     He hears splashing in the bath-tub.  He steps over, looks into

     the murky water.  Suddenly a SMALL SILVER FISH leaps from the

     water, lands at his feet, panting heavily and flapping about.

     He leans down, picks the fish up, throws it back into the

     water.

     Like a blind man, he feels the walls, comes to a door in the

     shadows.  He hears something on the other side, hesitates, hand

     inches from the doorknob.  He leans down.

     TIGHT ON HIS EYE

     Blinking through the key-hole.

     P.O.V. OF AN EMPTY ROOM  -  A glimpse of motion  -  the door

     across the room (leading to a corridor?) is shutting.

     INT.  HOTEL ROOM  -  NIGHT

     WHITE pushes the door open, steps into the adjoining room.

     No sign of life.  Cheap decorations.  He walks around

     cautiously.  Turns lights on.  Then reconsiders.  Turns them off

     again.  Disturbed, he studies his features in a wall mirror.

     ANGLE ON OPEN BATHROOM DOOR  -  the fish has jumped from the tub

     again and is flapping on the floor.

     White steps back into the bathroom.  He picks up the fish again,

     doesn't know what to do with it, so he puts it in his pocket.

     BACK IN THE OTHER ROOM

     He searches through things.  A grey overcoat in the closet.  He

     goes through the pockets, finds a WALLET.  No I.D., just a

     laundry bill, some money and a postcard from a sea-side town.

     ANGLE ON A REVOLVER on the bed-side table.  He picks it up, his

     grip tightens on the handle, his finger applies pressure to the

     trigger and...

     BANG!

     The gun goes off.  A BULLET RICOCHETS wildly around the room,

     bounces off the metal bed-head, smashes a vase, embeds itself

     in the wall.

     Startled, he holds the gun away from him like it might go off

     again.  He examines it carefully now.  Opens the chamber.

     TIGHT ON THE GUN  -  Five bullets left.

     He turns the chamber carefully, shuts it, puts the gun in the

     inside pocket of the coat.

     He moves to the bed.  A RIPPED PHOTOGRAPH on the rug.  A

     fragment of a woman's face, her left eye.  He lifts the

     fragment up.  There's handwriting on the back, part of a note:

               ...MEANS THE MOST TO ME.  LOVE YOU

               FOREVER.  -  E...

     The rest is missing.

     He sits on the edge of the bed.  As he does this, he notices

     something else on the floor.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  follows a dark stain on the floorboards, to a

     woman's bare foot behind the bed.  He stands abruptly, fumbles

     across the bed to stare into a dark corner of the room.

     In the shadows he can make out a woman's naked BODY lying in a

     pool of blood.  Her eyes stare lifeless.

     White stumbles back in horror, throws his hands across his

     mouth.

     INT.  HOTEL CORRIDOR  -  NIGHT

     White stumbles from the room, leans against a wall for support.

     Lights flicker.

     At the end of the corridor, elevator doors open.  Light and

     musak flood out.

     INT.  LOBBY  -  NIGHT

     White staggers from the elevator, moves past a deserted front

     desk.  A VOICE from the back room:

                         HOTEL MANAGER O.S.

               Hey, you! You gotta message.

     White stops, looks uncertainly towards a bead curtain.

                         WHITE

               What?

                         MANAGER O.S.

               Message in d'box!  You deaf?

     White sees several nooks for messages and keys in front of him.

     Reaching across the desk, he glances through the bead curtain

     into the manager's office.  TELEVISION SOUNDS O.S.

     HIS P.O.V.

     Hard to see  -  the man sits in the chair, lit by the glow of

     the T.V. set.  White grabs the note, looks at it.  A PHONE

     NUMBER, also his room number, and what appears to be his name:

     JONATHAN WHITE.  That's all.  White thrusts the message in his

     pocket.

                         MANAGER O.S.

               Got my money?

                         WHITE

               What?  I...  How long have I been

               here?

                         MANAGER O.S.

               Jeez, too damn long if you ask me!

               What about the two weeks y'owe me...

     Totally confused, White turns to leave, sees something.  Stops.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  A painting on a wall (cheap print variety)  -

     waves on a beach.  A breeze rustles the pages of a calender,

     pinned beside the picture.

     TIGHT ON WHITE  -  MOVE IN on his ear.  O.S. SOUND  -  surf

     crashes on shore.  A WOMAN'S VOICE WHISPERS:

                         VOICE O.S.

               What is your name...  What is your

               name...

     He backs away from the painting, looks about the lobby in panic

     -  sees a sign:  TOILETS.  A painted hand points the way.

                         MANAGER O.S.

               Hey!

                         WHITE (without turning)

               I'll be back later.

                         MANAGER O.S.

               Yeah.  Well, y'better be.

     CAMERA REVEALS A FIGURE  -  watching from a shadowy corner of

     the lobby.

     As White runs out, the MYSTERY MAN picks up a pay-phone, dials.

     Whispers into the receiver in a foreign language.

     INT.  CORRIDOR  -  NIGHT

     White pushes shakily through a red door, runs down a corridor.

     Pipes steam and drip water.  He rounds a corner, slips, nearly

     falls.

     INT.  MEN'S ROOM  -  NIGHT

     Puddles on the floor, stains on the walls.

     White bursts through the door and into a cubicle.  He bends

     over a toilet bowl and VOMITS.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     He looks up, wipes his mouth on his sleeve.  A breeze tugs at

     his stringy hair.  A tiny ventilation grill above the cistern

     looks out at the street.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  OUTSIDE

     Sheets of newspaper blow past.  A full moon, surrounded by

     blood red clouds, hangs above empty streets.

     INT.  CINEMA  -  NIGHT

     A WATCH  -  on a hairy wrist.  Seconds tick past.  Soft

     flickering light.  VOICES O.S.

     ANGLE ON FRANK BUMSTEAD  -  police inspector.  He looks down at

     the watch.  Time to leave.  He STANDS, heads for an illuminated

     exit sign.

     Images flicker on a SCREEN.  The inspector rushes to the door,

     runs into an USHER, who gasps.

                         BUMSTEAD (to usher)

               Gesundheit!

     Bumstead quickly moves off.

     INT.  CINEMA LOBBY

     The INSPECTOR makes a call, licks the tip of a pencil,

     scribbles in a notebook.  Behind thick glass, he argues

     soundlessly into a phone.

     BIG IN FOREGROUND  -  a popcorn machine rattles noisily.

     INSIDE THE BOOTH

     The inspector is upset, face strained.  A MALE VOICE chatters

     quickly through the receiver.

                         BUMSTEAD (cuts in)

               ...but you told me the meeting was

ten-thirty

.

     A burst of chatter.

                         BUMSTEAD

               I know, sir, but I can't make it at

nine-thirty

...  It's  -  um  -  well,

               inconvenient...

     A stream of chatter stops him.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Yes, sir...  I understand...  Yes...

               But, I've done fine so far without an

               assistant...

     The inspector tries to interject as the VOICE cuts in again...

                         BUMSTEAD

               But...  But I...  I...

                    (defeated)

               Nine-thirty.  Yes.

     INT.  MEN'S ROOM

     We are underwater.  WHITE's FACE swims into view.  Bubbles spew

     from the mouth,  the eyes stare in horror.

     ANGLE ON MEN'S ROOM

     White washes his face in a sink.  He looks up, wipes his face

     dry with his coat.  He turns towards the door to leave.

     There are TWO  -  identical.  He cannot remember which he came

     through.  Takes a guess, opens one and steps into darkness.

     He realizes he's picked the wrong door, tries to go back but

     the door CLICKS behind him:  locked.

     INT.  CONCRETE TUNNEL

     Pitch black.  Trickling water.  A distant voice over a P.A.

     system recites names, followed by numbers.  A LIGHT, far away.

     White walks towards it.

     He steps into a bare concrete area, a public phone hangs on a

     blank wall.  He pulls a coin from his pocket, puts it in the

     slot, dials the number on his message.  Ringing  -  no answer.

     Suddenly White feels cold.

                         VOICE O.S.

There

 you are.

     Startled, White drops the phone and turns.  A figure moves

     forward out of darkness:

     ANGLE ON THE MYSTERY MAN from the hotel lobby.  The stranger

     wears a long black coat, dark glasses, and has extremely pale

     skin.  He is completely bald.  He studies White carefully.

     White glances about nervously  -  walks back up the corridor,

     his eyes pinned to the man.

                         MYSTERY MAN

               You are lost, yes?

     White retreats faster.

     A FLASH OF STEEL  -  a dagger appears by the stranger's side,

     gripped in a black leather glove.  He moves forward, a grin on

     his pale face.

     White stops, backs against the wall.

                         MYSTERY MAN

               Co-operate.  Do not make this

               difficult.

     White panics  -  he's cornered.  He remembers the revolver.  He

     pulls it from his coat and LEVELS it at the stranger, his hand

     shakes terribly.

     ON THE STRANGER continuing to advance.  Something about his

     eyes makes White immobile, unable to think clearly.

                         MYSTERY MAN

               You will not shoot, yes.  There is a

               place in your mind, a corner of

               darkness...

     THE GUN FIRES again and again.  Red splashes appear on the man.

     His shoulder.  His leg.  His neck.  He walks forward, with

     spastic jerks as bullets RIP into him.

     A final shot POINT BLANK into the stranger's forehead.  A

     stream of black liquid spouts from the hole.

     Blue smoke clears.  The man stands motionless, his mouth hangs

     open.  Then his eyes roll up, and he collapses to the ground.

     INT.  MORGUE  -  NIGHT

     CLICKING of new leather shoes, walking, striking tiles.

     INSPECTOR BUMSTEAD strides down a silent corridor.  He reaches

     into his pocket, removes a SURGICAL MASK, places it over his

     nose and mouth.

     WIDER ANGLE

     Bumstead steps up to a bald man with a moustache standing at

     the end of the corridor.  The man, who is dressed identically

     to the inspector, is his superior:  CHIEF-INSPECTOR STROMBOLI.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Good evening, sir.

                         STROMBOLI

               Yes.  This way.

     STROMBOLI leads the inspector into a tiled room containing

     several COVERED BODIES.  The two men are greeted by a cheerful-

     looking MORTICIAN.

                         MORTICIAN

               Welcome, gentlemen.  Youire early.

               Here for the examination, right?

     Stromboli nods, then ignores the mortician and walks along the

     row of corpses.  Bumstead follows.

                         STROMBOLI

               The handiwork of an extremely sick

               individual.

     He throws back covers to reveal horrible mutilations.

                         STROMBOLI

               Youive read the reports.  Not much to

               go on.  We know nothing about him,

               except that he likes to cut them...

               Always the same type of blade.

               Forensics match in each case...

               Anyway, it's all in the reports, read

               them for yourself.

     STROMBOLI shakes his head, turns away from the final body,

     looks at the inspector.

                         STROMBOLI

               Why are you wearing that thing on

               your face?

                         BUMSTEAD

               Germs, sir.  These places are full of

               them.

                         STROMBOLI

               I see.

                    (continues)

               One thingis for sure, heis ambitious.

               Youill be a busy man from now on.

                         MORTICIAN

               You can say that again.

     Stromboli looks annoyed at the smiling man.  The Mortician

     becomes serious and goes back to his work.

                         BUMSTEAD

               What about Thompson, sir?  Wasnit

               this his case?

                         STROMBOLI

               Thompson suffered a kind of severe

               delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway

               he isnit with us any longer.  The

               case is yours.  Go through his files.

               Take what you need.

                    (less business-like)

               By the way, howis your mother?

                         BUMSTEAD

               Sheis getting better, thanks.  She...

                         STROMBOLI (cuts in)

               Very good...

     The chief-inspector turns, paces to the door briskly.

                         STROMBOLI

               Letis go, Bumstead.  So much to do

               and so little time.

     EXT.  BUILDING  -  NIGHT

     A large faded BILLBOARD advertisement on a building facade.  A

     portrait of a smiling woman clutching a product called, "LUMP-

     O"  -  a cereal box carton.

     THE CAMERA MOVES IN STEADILY, rises upwards, CLOSER on the

     womanis face, finally enters a hole at the centre of her

     PAINTED IRIS.

     INT.  STAIR-WELL

     A raftered room on the other side of the billboard.  CAMERA

     TILTS TO a convoluted staircase  -  at the base, the SHADOW OF

     A MAN runs.

     FEET pace rapidly.  TILT UP TO REVEAL  -  WHITE.

     CAMERA FOLLOWS as he tries to lose himself from possible

     pursuers.  He steps through a low archway into a back alley,

     rounds a corner.

     A DEAD-END.  White stops, looks around, then up.  Heis breathing

     heavily, trying to catch his breath.  He starts to shake.

     ABOVE, the walls stretch into darkness.  An OPENING way up

     there  -  he can see stars.  Something dark crosses the gap of

     sky.  A RUSHING NOISE in the distance.  Wind starts to pick up.

     Trash is being kicked up.  A sheet of NEWSPAPER wraps around

     Whiteis leg.  He tries to kick it away repeatedly but it wonit

     come off.  He bends down, grabs it to throw it away, but

     something grabs his eye.

     He stares at the page for a moment  -  then his LEGS SLIP from

     under him and he falls to the ground.  He holds his head like

     itis going to explode.  A whimper deep in his throat.  His body

     is trembling violently.

     PUSH IN TIGHT on the paper on the ground.  A front-page

     headline:  MAN-HUNT CONTINUES FOR SERIAL KILLER!

     White looks up  -  terrified.  The RUSHING NOISE O.S. again.

     HIS P.O.V.

     ON THE WALL facing him, a DOOR has appeared where moments

     before there was nothing.  The door creaks open to reveal

     ANOTHER DOOR WITHIN.  This one extends outwards on the end of a

     lengthening wooden shaft.

     White, stands quickly, thrusts the newspaper into a pocket.

     Tries to side-step the ADVANCING DOOR but itis too late, he can

     only open it and step through, to avoid getting pinned to the

     wall.

     INT.  HOTEL LOBBY  -  NIGHT

     HAND-HELD P.O.V. THROUGH the swaying beads hanging in the back-

     room doorway.  TWO FIGURES peer into the room.

                         FIGURE 1

               We are looking for Jonathan White.

     THE HOTEL MANAGER looks up, moves forward into light:  a squat,

     hunch-backed man with glasses.  He steps through the beads,

     glares at the intruders.

                         MANAGER

               What for?

     ON THE MEN  -  an uncanny resemblance to the one who tried to

     kill White.  Black coats, glasses, pale skin.  Creepy.

     A BLACK GLOVED HAND flashes forward, grips the manageris face

     and doesnit let go.  The manager struggles, gulps for air.

     Heis pushed back heavily against the wall.

                         MAN 1

               Which room is he in?

     The leather glove SQUEEZES, blood trickles from the manageris

     ears, through the fingers.

     INT.  ROOM 43

     ANOTHER (VERY SHORT) FIGURE is searching the room.  He hears

     NOISES O.S. in the corridor, runs to the door, presses against

     the wall.

     ON THE MAN  -  FREDRICK  -  a stunted body, an oversized head,

     thick limbs.  The rest of his features lost in shadow.

     The door swings open, a shaft of light floods the dark room.

     ON THE TWO MYSTERY MEN as they step in and look around.  They

     search the room, knock stuff over.  One of the men kicks at the

     womanis corpse in the corner.  Behind him, Fredrick, still

     hiding near the door, slips into the corridor unnoticed.

     EXT.  FLYING P.O.V.  -  NIGHT

     A FLYING PERSPECTIVE past buildings.  An INSECT-LIKE BUZZING

     O.S.  Way down BELOW, in a canyon of silent buildings, a LONE

     FIGURE walks.

     EXT.  DOWN ON THE STREET

     A breeze pulls at WHITEis hair and coat.  He takes out the

     wallet  -  a few dollars.

     HIS P.O.V. AS HE WALKS

     The city is DEAD.  Empty.  Desolate.  Buildings hang down out

     of black.  Day-time was never invented.

     As he puts the wallet back in his pocket, a BUSINESS CARD he

     hadnit noticed, flutters to the ground.  He stops, picks it up.

     In simple print:  DOCTOR D.P. SCHREBER M.D., a phone number.

     Scribbled handwriting on the back says:  Thursday 0930.

     ON WHITE  -  he glances across the street.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  A cafe.  A broken NEON FISH buzzes above the

     doorway.

     INT.  CHINESE CAFE

     He walks up rickety stairs, into a small room with five or six

     tables.  Empty.  Dirty.  He sits and waits.

     A CLOCK ticks on the wall  -  midnight.  White coughs, for

     attention.

     A NOISE from a doorway.  A SHADOW moves towards him, dragging

     one foot as it walks.  A SMALL ASIAN WOMAN appears and limps to

     his table.  She speaks very quickly IN CHINESE.  He does not

     understand.

     She points to a chalk board on the wall  -  a list of dishes

     also in Chinese, only one in English  -  the last one.  At the

     bottom.  In small print.  "NOODLES".

                         WHITE (nods)

               The noodles.  Iill have some noodles.

     The old woman rips a YELLOW TICKET from a pad, gives it to

     White.  A number on it.  She points her crooked finger again

     at a SPEAKER BOX above a small serving window in the wall.  A

     greenish fluoro pulses from the room within.

                         WOMAN

               We call.

     She leaves again.

     White looks about the empty room.  Insects are zapped on an

     illuminated DEVICE hanging on the wall.  An old air-conditioner

     RATTLES noisily.

     NOISES from the kitchen  -  voices argue in Chinese, a baby

     cries.  Then SILENCE.

     White removes the newspaper from his coat and spreads it on the

     table.

     He overcomes his fear, starts to read the article.  Leans

     forward, hands trembling.  Without realising, he holds the

     paper OVER A CANDLE burning on the table.  The paper CATCHES

     FIRE, is engulfed.  He drops the flaming page on the table.  Now

     the table-cloth starts to burn.

     White is frantic.  On a nearby table he finds a pitcher of

     water, and dumps this on the flames.  It kills the fire but

     leaves a black hole in the table-cloth.  The paper is ash.

     He moves to another table pretending nothing happened, fans the

     smoke away.

     INT.  POLICE STATION  -  NIGHT

     BUMSTEAD is moving quickly.  He suddenly trips and falls to the

     floor.  He curses under his breath, then looks up.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A door  -  THOMPSON:  DETECTIVE/INSPECTOR on the frosted glass.

     Bumstead stands, pushes into the office.

     INSIDE

     A total mess  -  paperwork everywhere, dozens of used coffee

     cups, rotting food in greasy paper bags.  Bumstead shakes his

     head.

                         BUMSTEAD

               A real shame...

     He starts to look around.

     TIGHT ON FILING CABINET  -  a drawer is pulled open.

     Thompsonis files are also a mess.  Bumstead continues to shake

     his head.  He reaches for a file.  A loud SNAP!

                         BUMSTEAD (screams)

               YAAAAAAAAAH!

     He recoils.  A mousetrap has snapped over his fingers.  He

     pulls it off his hand, throws it to the floor, cursing.

     INT.  CHINESE CAFE

     White is still waiting for his food.

     He leans down to scratch an itchy ankle, lifts his trouser leg

     to examine the bites  -  worse, inflamed.  He uses a napkin to

     wipe at the pus.

     AERIAL PERSPECTIVE OF A FLY  -  circling the room, looking down

     on White.

     ON THE FLY  -  It lands on a plate of half eaten food on

     another table.  The creature is some kind of SURVEILLANCE

     DEVICE  -  half insect/half machine.  Itis spying on him.  MOVE

     IN TIGHT as inbuilt camera lenses focus in its head.  It shits

     on the food behind it.

     White is oblivious to this.  Heis finished examining his leg,

     is sitting quietly.  He yawns.  His head nods forward briefly.

     A NOISE.  White looks up.

     A TRAP-DOOR has opened in the ceiling.  Two feet in black

     leather shoes descend from the hole.  A sea breeze blows

     through the room.  The SOUND OF SURF, SEAGULLS CRYING.

     ON Whiteis nose twitching.  He can smell the ocean.

     The WALLPAPER COMES ALIVE  -  like a seething tangle of worms.

     One by one, THREE MEN in black coats lower into the room,

     floating on air.  They pull out knifes, step forward.

     ON WHITE rigid with terror.

     ON THE MEN  -  though their faces cannot be seen clearly in the

     gloom, they too resemble the MAN who confronted White earlier.

     They walk towards him slowly, holding knifes above their heads.

     Ready to attack.  They lean over him, pause dramatically.

                         MAN 1

               Donit fall asleep.

                    (chuckles softly)

               Might never wake, yes.

     This Man turns to the others.  They all smile, then turn back

     to White.

                         MEN (in unison)

               Fifty-six.

     ANOTHER VOICE has been speaking softly  -  now it is louder.

     Repeating:

                         VOICE

               Fifty-six...  Fifty-six...

     ANGLE  -  a chair falls to the floor.

     White leaps up from the table, terrified, disoriented.  Just a

     DREAM  -  he had dozed.

     WIDEN ANGLE  -  The place is still empty.  White glances to the

     serving window.  A DISH waits for him, framed in the glowing

     fluoro square.  He gets it.  A bowl of soupy liquid with

     noodles.  He sits down.

     He is about to start eating  -  realizes he has a fork instead

     of a spoon.  Picking up the bowl again, he heads to the

     kitchen.

     INT.  CORRIDOR

     He takes a door beneath a set of wooden stairs and finds

     himself in another corridor.  He looks about, unsure which

     direction to go in.

     INT.  SERIES OF ROOMS  -  LATER

     White is lost, still holding the soup.

     He moves through a number of RUSTED METAL DOORS that open and

     shut automatically.  Each reveals another room or corridor.

     Deserted spaces long forgotten  -  dusty, crumbling.

     He feels the fish moving about in his pocket, pulls it out and

     looks at it.

     White holds the dying fish in one hand, the bowl of cold soup

     in the other.  Disgusted, he puts the fish into the bowl.

     INT.  CORRIDOR

     A TICKING SOUND O.S.

     White stops.  Looks up.  A large clock suspended from the

     rafters.  A tug at his coat.

     Standing beside him is FREDRICK  -  the little man from Whiteis

     hotel room.

                         FREDRICK (stutters)

               Where have you been?  The doctoris

               been worried about you.

                         WHITE

               What?  Who are you?

     Fredrick looks nervously down the corridor.

                         FREDRICK

               Cimon, letis go!  We donit have any

               time.

     The little man grabs Whiteis sleeve, starts to pull him along.

                         WHITE

               Hold it a minute.  Letis start at the

               beginning, huh?

     ANGLE ON  -  the top of a set of stairs in front of them.  Two

     dark figures appear.

     Fredrick looks up at them in horror.

                         FRERICK

               Shit!

                    (looks at White)

               Quick!  Run!

     Both men run like crazy, White awkwardly holding the bowl of

     soup.  They come to a junction, each takes a separate corridor.

     Fredrick finds some stairs, climbs two at a time.

     White climbs INTO FRAME, looks around, finds another corridor.

     The little man is nowhere to be seen.  White reaches another

     junction  -  several corridors branch off.             

     HIS P.O.V. PANNING AROUND                   

     Each passageway completely deserted.        

                         WHITE

               Shit.                                       

     He keeps running.

     INT.  HOTEL LOBBY

     A PHOTO FLASH  -  illuminates the dead body of the hotel manager,

     slumped in his own blood.

     Bumstead leans INTO FRAME, examines the corpse.  He notices

     several stab wounds in the manis abdomen.  Various cops search

     the room.

     One cop walks up to the Inspector.

                         COP

               We got another one upstairs

                         BUMSTEAD (deadpan)

               Great.

     INT.  ROOM  -  NIGHT

     A SMALL ROOM with arched windows that look over the city.

     Fredrick is pulling a notebook and pen from under an upturned

     table.

     He scrawls rapidly, screws the message into a tight tube, then

     puts it into a METAL CYLINDER he finds beneath the table also.

     He glances out a window, notices A FIGURE standing beneath a

     street-lamp below, looking up at him.  Startled, Fredrick darts

     back into shadow, goes to a wall covered in about a dozen

     vertical PIPES running up into the ceiling.

     TIGHT ON ONE OF THE PIPES  -  he opens a small hatch and puts

     the metal cylinder in it.  The cylinder is snatched from his

     hand, sucked into the pipe with a rush of air.

     WIDER

     Fredrick steps back, a sigh of relief.  A shadow falls across

     his back.  He turns.  He screams.

     INT./EXT.  VARIOUS

     TIGHT  -  rushing along lengths of rusted pipe, at blinding

     speed.  The cylinder races around corners.  It clanks and

     grinds.  HURTLES up the side of a building.  THEN PLUMMETS

     underground.  Rushes through darkness.

     EXT.  BRIDGE  -  NIGHT

     THE CAMERA MOVES along a bridge-like structure.  An enclosed

     corridor supported by rotting wooden pylons.  Under the bridge,

     pipes spew sewage into stagnant water.

     ANGLE ON WHITE WALKING  -  seen through a series of illuminated,

     dirty, windows.  He occasionally glances into the bowl he holds

     before him.

     INSIDE

     TIGHT ON the fish swimming weakly in the soup.

     ANGLE ON WHITE  -  He stops, looks up at O.S. SOUND of

     clattering metal.  A pipe runs the length of the corridor  -

     the invisible clanging cylinder races away, into darkness.

     Then the silence is shattered by a piercing series of SCREAMS

     somewhere in the building.  White hurriedly moves towards the

     source.

     ANOTHER CORRIDOR

     White rounds a corner, stops, notices a small rectangular HOLE

     in a wall.  ANOTHER SCREAM, weaker now  -  He runs to the hole

     in the wall and looks through.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A small, very ordered ROOM.  A fake fireplace bathes the room

     in a warm glow.

     White cranes his neck forward, stretches his head through the

     hole.  He can see into an adjoining room to his right  -  two

     dark figures stand over a man on the floor lying in a pool of

     dark crimson.  The man looks up  -  itis Fredrick  -  just as

     both dark figures stab him repeatedly with bloody daggers.  He

     doesnit scream this time, just gags on blood running from his

     mouth.

     Suddenly a sliding door SLAMS onto the back of Whiteis neck,

     traps his head in the hole.  He struggles, tries to free

     himself.  Drops the bowl of soup.  It shatters on the hard

     floor, makes a mess.

     INSIDE THE BATHROOM  -  The killers look up at the smashing

     noise.

     BACK IN THE CORRIDOR  -  White pulls with all his strength.

     The door gives and he stumbles backwards.  He is about to run

     away but glances at the floor.

     The fish is flapping about  -  still alive.

     EXT.  STREET

     White darts from a doorway, trips and falls.  He sprawls at the

     base of sweeping stone steps.  He looks at a building towering

     above him.  Chiselled in the facade, above the entrance:

     LIBRARY.

     INT.  POLICE STATION

     A series of ply-wood SILHOUETTES race through frame.  Stop

     suddenly, mechanically.  LOUD GUNSHOTS.  Chunks of ply-wood

     blast away violently.

     BUMSTEAD is practising his marksmanship.

     A HAND  -  on his shoulder.  He whips around, startled.

     ON MISS CRENSHAW  -  a young, stiff-looking woman.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Dammit!

                         MISS CRENSHAW

               Sorry, sir.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Donit ever sneak up on me like that!

               Who are you?

                         MISS CRENSHAW

               Patricia Crenshaw.

     She puts out her hand.

                         MISS CRENSHAW

               Iim your new assistant.

                         BUMSTEAD

               I didnit requisition a secretary.

                         MISS CRENSHAW

               The Chief-Inspector thought you might

               need a hand.

                         BUMSTEAD (uncertain)

               Oh.

     He takes her hand tentatively.  They shake.

                         MISS CRENSHAW

               Iive taken the liberty and had

               Inspector Thompsonis office searched,

               as I believe you instructed.  All

               clear now, sir.  They found several

               more traps and things were filed

               under pretty strange categories...

               Poor man.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Good.

                         MISS CRENSHAW

               You wonit regret this, sir.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Fine.

     Bumstead moves off.

     INT.  LIBRARY

     White steps into a vast, empty room, stops beneath a big sign

     saying, SILENCE in formal letters.  The place seems abandoned,

     then he notices a hint of movement.  Cigarette smoke snakes

     into the air, a light, across the expanse of polished floor.

     He walks up to an elderly female LIBRARIAN sitting behind a

     desk, smoking, reading.  White looks somewhat distraught still.

                         WHITE

               Keep newspapers here, birth

               certificates, records of deaths, that

               kind of thing?

     The librarian looks up from her book.

                         LIBRARIAN

               Which would you like 

first

?

                         WHITE

               Okay.  Newspapers.

     She takes her glasses off.  Her eyes are TINY, like pin-heads.

     She studies White.

                         LIBRARIAN

               Are you alright?

     He looks around  -  restrained panic.

                         WHITE (looks at the woman)

               Sure.  Iim fine.

                         LIBRARIAN (nods)

               Mmm-hmm.  Stairs at the end of the

               hall.  Third floor.  Turn left.

               Section C-7.  Row 35, near the

               toilets.

     She replaces her glasses, watches White rush away.

                         LIBRARIAN

               Donit mention it...

     She blows her nose into a handkerchief.  The snort ECHOES

     LOUDLY.

     INT.  LIBRARY CORRIDOR

     White rushes down a dark hall lined with bronze statues.  He

     finds section C then walks between towering rows stacked with

     old volumes.  Comes to number 7.

     He follows an arrow past row after row  -  finally finds Row 34

     but then it skips straight to letters again, A, B, C, etc.

     No Row 35.

     He stops and looks around  -  sure enough a door displays a

     small sign:  TOILETS.

     White is sweating profusely.  He now sits on a chair, takes off

     his shoes, rubs his feet.  He pulls a book from a shelf behind

     him, looks about, opens the book and tears several pages out,

     folds them, stuffs them into his shoes to plug up the holes.

     He gets up, tries to backtrack, comes across an elaborate

     diagram of the library interior.  An arrow points to a section

     near a wing labelled:  MAPS.  Near the arrow it says:  YOU ARE

     HERE.

     He keeps walking.

     He finds the door to the maps wing but the door is locked, a

     sign is nailed to it:  WE ARE REMODELLING.  WE APOLOGIZE FOR ANY

     INCONVENIENCE.

     White, annoyed now, tries to force his way in.  Puts his

     shoulder to the door, pushes several times.  It CRUMBLES under

     his weight  -  rotten.

     He finds himself in a DUSTY ROOM.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A narrow room, filled with rows of bookshelves with stacks of

     old newspapers.

     TIGHT ON WHITE  -  he steps forward, pulls a folded newspaper

     off the shelf.  The instant he picks it up, it crumbles to dust

     in his hands.  He picks up another, and another, each in turn

     breaking apart and dissolving to nothingness.

     INT.  DARK CHAMBER  -  NIGHT

     TWO SILHOUETTED FIGURES face each other across a polished black

     table.  They speak in a foreign language.  A phone rings.

     Figure 1 picks up the receiver and listens attentively.

     Figure 2 is involved with various metal shapes he is trying to

     lock together.  A complex puzzle.  He gets impatient with the

     puzzle, dashes it to the floor.

     Figure 1, on the phone, hangs up and writes something.  Hands

     the note to Figure 2, who in turn drops it into A CHUTE.

     CONTROL ROOM

     The note falls from a slot in the wall before Figure 3 (in

     shadow yet again).  He reads from the note over a silver

     microphone, still in the unfamiliar tongue.

     TIGHT ON A SPEAKER  -  his distorted voice.  A final mysterious

     person  -  Figure 4  -  listens to the announcement.  He takes

     a stick and moves a small cut-out figure of a man across a

     board, away from a large grouping of similar cut-outs.  The

     board resembles a planning table in a war-room.

     A HIGH ANGLE as the CAMERA PULL BACKS on the grouping of cut

     out figures.  More and more of them.  Ten.  Twenty.  A hundred.

     A sinister army.

     INT.  INTERSECTING STREET  -  NIGHT

     White is in a phone booth.  He removes the note from his

     pocket, dials.  No answer again.  He dials the OPERATOR.  A

     muffled voice over the line.

                         WHITE

               Iim trying to reach nine zero eight

               triple two.  I canit get through...

                    (beat)

               What?!...

                    (angry)

               Shit!

     He reaches into his pocket, pulls out a coin, puts it into the

     slot.  Heis sweating again.  He wipes his brow with a trembling

     hand.

                         WHITE

               It is?...  Which area is that number

               listed in?...  Is that near the

               ocean?...  The 

ocean

...  Never mind.

               Have a Jonathan White listed?...

               WHITE.  Seventeen?  All Johns?  I

               see...  Never mind.

     He hangs up, then removes the business card he found in his

     wallet.  He is about to dial but decides otherwise.  He steps

     into the street.

     A HIGH ANGLE

     White walks between tall buildings, towards a narrow street

     that branches off into two separate routes.  He stops.  He

     canit decide which branch to take  -  he steps to the left,

     then steps back, takes a few steps to the right, reconsiders

     again...

     INT.  POLICE STATION/BUMSTEADiS OFFICE  -  NIGHT

     TRACK ALONG  -  piles of towering files bursting at the seams

     with paperwork  -  TO FIND Bumstead hunched over notes,

     photographs and files.  His eyes are rimmed with red.  He

     doesnit seem to be getting anywhere.

                         CRENSHAW O.S.

               Coffee?

     He looks up.  The secretary stands in the doorway with another

     big pile of paperwork.

                         BUMSTEAD

               What?  I donit drink coffee.  A cup

               of tea would be good.  Milk and no

               sugar.

     Crenshaw puts the paperwork down on Bumsteadis already

     overcrowded desk.

                         CRENSHAW

               Making progress?

     He looks at her like she just slapped him.

                         BUMSTEAD

               These are the investigations of a

               madman.  He has fabricated an entire

               bizarre paranoid delusion with no

               internal logic whatever.

                    (without looking up)

               This is a mess.  A horrible mess.

                    (looks at her now)

               Itis the second time now.

     Miss Crenshaw looks concerned.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Look at this!

     He holds up a sheet of white paper  -  a report.  The woman

     steps over and looks at it.

                         BUMSTEAD

               You typed this report?

                         MISS CRENSHAW

               Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?

                         BUMSTEAD

               Wrong?  Look at this!

     The woman bends down, adjusts her glasses, examines it.

                         MISS CRENSHAW

               It seems fine.

                         BUMSTEAD

Fine

?  Look here!

     His finger points at the bottom of the page  -  a tiny,

     INSIGNIFICANT ink smudge.

                         BUMSTEAD

               How can I submit this?

                         MISS CRENSHAW

               Iim sorry...

                         BUMSTEAD

               Do you wash your hands before you

               type things?

                         MISS CRENSHAW

               Why, yes.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Well be more careful, please.

     An embarrassed beat, then:

     RI-I-I-ING!

     Bumstead reaches for the phone but Crenshaw is on it first.

                         CRENSHAW

               Inspector Bumsteadis office...

               Yes...  Yes...

     She cups the receiver with her hand, looks at Bumstead.

                         MISS CRENSHAW

               Yes, sir.  The Chief-Inspector said

               he would see you now.

     INT.  POLICE STATION HALL-WAY

     TRACKING SHOT towards a door:  CHIEF-INSPECTOR on the frosted

     glass.  A hand reaches INTO FRAME, knocks twice.

                         STROMBOLI O.S.

               Enter!

     INSIDE

     Bumstead steps into the office  -  finds STROMBOLI wandering

     about the room, distracted, searching for something...

                         STROMBOLI

               What is it?

     He pulls the waste-basket up and empties the contents onto his

     desk, sorts through it.

                         BUMSTEAD

               A formality.  I need to speak with

               Thompson.  Officially I need your

               written permission.

     Stromboli is looking through his desk drawers now.

                         STROMBOLI

               Why do you want to speak to him?

                         BUMSTEAD

               A hunch.  He might be able to...

                         STROMBOLI (from under desk)

               Bumstead, donit be so paranoid.

               Leave him alone  -  heis a sad case.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Itis extremely important to my

               investigation...

                         STROMBOLI

               Iill be the judge of that.  Anything

               else?

                         BUMSTEAD

               Actually, I was wondering, sir, if

               you could let me have a few uniforms,

               to follow up for me...

                         STROMBOLI O.S. (pokes head above desk)

               Absolutely not.  Up to my ears in

               cases right now  -  canit spare

               anyone.

     Stromboli becomes distracted again  -  stands up, looks behind

     pictures hanging off the walls.  A big sign suspended above his

     desk says, SO MUCH TO DO AND SO LITTLE TIME  -  his motto.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Lost something?

                         STROMBOLI

               What makes you think that!  If you

               would learn to concentrate on facts,

               not get so side-tracked  -  you might

               get things done faster, Bumstead...

     The door clicks shut.  Stromboli looks up  -  the inspector has

     gone.

     EXT.  PLAZA  -  NIGHT

     White walks under stone archways.

     Across an empty plaza is a sign above a door:   DRUGS OPEN 24

     HOURS and in smaller print, recently added beneath:   SHAVE &

     HAIRCUT $5.00.

     INT.  DRUG STORE  -  NIGHT

     White walks between bare, dusty shelves.  Only one shelf

     carries products  -  BOX AFTER BOX OF "LUMP-O".  He moves up to

     a small counter.  A man with thick glasses, dressed like a

     BARBER, is seated there.

                         WHITE

               I need something to keep me awake.

                         BARBER

               Looks like you need a haircut to me.

                         WHITE

               Thanks.  Just some pills.

                         BARBER

               Only two bucks.  Shave as well...

                         WHITE (annoyed now)

               Your sign says you sell drugs  -

               well, Iim here to buy some.  Okay?

                         BARBER

               Relax.  Sure!

     He waves dramatically to a shelf above his head, with several

     bottles of all sorts of different coloured capsules.

                         BARBER

               Tell you what  -  let me cut yer

               hair, give ya watcha need half price.

               Canit argue at that!

                         WHITE (evenly)

               I donit 

want

 a haircut.

     LATER

     CAMERA TRACKS OFF a clock on a wall  -  REVEALS WHITE in a

     barber chair.  The BARBER gleefully works on WHITEis hair.  A

     thin OLD GUY in a moth-eaten suit steps from behind a curtain,

     smiles, playing a violin.  Heis passionate but bad.

                         BARBER (talks fast)

               Cut hair when I was in the navy,

               yiknow  -  havenit lost the touch.

               Bet youire happy ebout that.  Huh!

                         WHITE

               Sell maps?

                         BARBER

               What of?

                         WHITE

               The city.  I need to get to the

               ocean.

                         BARBER

               Nope.  No maps.  Ocean, huh?  On

               vacation?

     White doesnit answer.  The old guy with the violin moves back

     and forth behind White, smiling as he plays.

                         BARBER

               Grandpa thought customers might like

               some mood music.

                         WHITE (unconvinced)

               Nice...

                         BARBER

               You still look familiar.  Itis

               driving me nuts!  Sure I donit know

               ya from somewhere?

                         WHITE (nervous now)

               Not me.

     Barber looks out the front window as his hands busily trim

     hair.

                         BARBER

               Mnunn.  Cold lately.

                    (lathers up Whiteis

                    face)

               That night, couple weeks ago.  That

               was 

real

 cold.  Remember that?

                         WHITE

               Not really...

                         BARBER

               Yeah, Iim like that.  Senility says

               the wife.  But she sure canit

               complain.  Heh.  The erector set still

               works good.

                    (points to head)

               And this ainit no fucking rug!

               Gihead.  Feel it!  All mine!

     Grandpa laughs and plays louder.

                         GRANDPA

               Yes! Feeeeel it!

     PUSH IN ON WHITE  -  he smiles weakly.

     INT.  DETAIL  -  NIGHT

     A HAND scrawls cryptic diagrams into a notebook.

     PULL OUT TO REVEAL

     DOCTOR SCHREBER at his desk.  Heis bearded, with thick lensed

     glasses.  He puts the phone down, sits quietly at his desk,

     staring into space, lost in thought.

     A LOUD RATTLING NOISE FILLS THE ROOM.  Schreber looks up.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A rusted pipe runs across the ceiling and down one wall.  He

     steps across to the pipe on the wall, leans down, looks into an

     open hatch at its base.

     Without warning, out of the hatch pops the metal cylinder FROM

     SEVERAL SCENES PREVIOUS and bounces off the doctor's head.

     He curses, picks it up, opens it.  He plucks out the note and

     reads FREDRICKis SCRAWLED MESSAGE:

               DOCTOR, I DID AS YOU ASKED.  BUT

               THINK I MADE STUPID MISTAKE.  HOPE

               THINGS DONiT GET BACK TO YOU.  SORRY.

               -  FREDRICK.

     Schreber looks up  -  then PUNCHES HIS FIST into the desk

     angrily.

     INT.  EMPTY BUILDING

     A P.O.V. MOVES DOWN halls made of wood slatting  -  the floors,

     walls and ceilings are bare boards.  FOOTSTEPS O.S.

     TIGHT ON  -  a manis shadow as it descends a wooden staircase.

     REVEAL WHITE  -  He rummages in a paper bag as he walks.  Pulls

     out two capsules, swallows them.  Now he pulls out a pack of

     "LUMP-O", rips it open, eats ravenously.

     EXT.  STREET  -  NIGHT

     White steps out into a street, turns a corner, drops the empty

     packet of cereal.  Now he sees TWO FIGURES APPROACH.  He hides

     behind a wall before he is seen.  Suddenly a deafening RINGING

     startles him.  He looks across a plaza.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  A CHURCH.  A bell-tower, black against the sky.

     White stares up into the night.

     INT. CHURCH - NIGHT

     White walks in, sits on A PEW, towards the back of the room,

     glances over his shoulder.  He tries to blend in with the SMALL

     GATHERING OF PEOPLE sitting silently around him.

     A PRIEST  -  appears at the altar, cloaked in a blood-red robe,

     followed by two altar boys also in red.  They move past a

     statue of an insect-like creature, walk in circles chanting

     softly, stop and stare at the congregation through eye-slits in

     their hoods.  The priest begins his sermon.

                         PRIEST

               Beware!  The night is deadly.  There

               is a criminal among us.

     White looks forward.

     TIGHT ON the priestis hand  -  It rises, points, moves over the

     heads of the congregation, accusingly.  Suddenly the red finger

     jabs towards an OLD WOMAN in the front row.

                         PRIEST

               It could be she!  The innocent across

               the street!

     All the congregation turn and stare at the woman.  Sheis

     terrified.

     The hand moves slowly now, across to a BEAUTIFUL JAPANESE WOMAN

     several rows back.

                         PRIEST

               Or the temptress next door!

     The priest pauses dramatically then:

                         PRIEST

               Or mister nervy stranger at the back!

     Suddenly the finger is pointing at White. All the faces turn,

     stare suspiciously at White.

     ANGLE ON WHITE  -  frozen with fright.  Fortunately his face is

     obscured by shadow and the priest lowers his hand, continues

     the sermon.  The people look away.

                         PRIEST

               You are thinking it could be anyone?

               And youire right!  Why, it could even

               be Mother!

     White goes to leave.  As he stands he notices the DOORS of the

     church open  -  two figures step in and move into the candle-

     light.

     MYSTERY MEN  -  Whiteis bizarre pursuers.  They look around.

     White ducks down, crawls between pews, startling several of the

     congregation.  He motions to them to keep quiet.  He runs into

     the legs of the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN the priest pointed out.  She is

     startled momentarily but looks down at him, smiles.

                         PRIEST (continues sermon)

               Evil stalks our streets.  It seeks to

               hide in our hearts.  Have you not

               evil within you now?

     White sees a nearby CONFESSION BOX.  Staying low, he runs,

     almost knocks over a large illuminated candle-holder, darts

     inside.  The girl watches him.

     A GAUNT-FACED WOMAN stands.  Hysterical.  She looks at the

     priest.

                         GAUNT WOMAN

               He took my little boy!  Iill rip out

               his eyes!

     INSIDE  -  White breaths relief.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  carved on the dark stained wood in front of him

     is a crucified insect.  A voice surprises him.  Another PRIEST,

     OLDER.

                         OLDER PRIEST

               You have sinned?

                         WHITE

               NO.  Ah...

     White watches the two Mystery Men walk past, through the ornate

     wooden grill in front of his face.

                         PRIEST

               I am listening.

                         WHITE (lying)

               Thereis a...  woman.  I don't know

               but I think I, ahh...

                         PRIEST

               You fornicated?

     The Mystery Men look towards the box for a moment, towards

     White, but keep walking.

                         WHITE

               No.  I, ah...

                         PRIEST

               You seem restless.

     The Mystery Men seem to have gone.  White takes out the gun,

     keeping it hidden from the priest.  Opens the chamber.

     TIGHT ON THE GUN  -  Only ONE BULLET left.

                         WHITE

               Someoneis after me.

                         PRIEST

               Then we must call the police.

                         WHITE

               No.  I mean...  that isnit necessary.

     The silhouette on the other side of the box leans forward.

                         PRIEST

               I see.  Then who is after you?  What

               sins have you committed?

                         WHITE

               Just let me sit here for a moment?

               Iill go soon, and stop bothering you.

     The priest suddenly stares incredulously at White.  His eyes

     widen in horror.

                         PRIEST

               Youire the murderer?

                    (starts to yell)

               Yes!  That must be it!  Donit kill

               me!

     White lunges, grabs his collar with one hand, slaps the other

     over his mouth.  The old man stares at him, trembling

     uncontrollably.

                         WHITE

               Shut up!  Listen.  Walk out quietly.

                    (holds up gun)

               Understand?

     The priest nods stupidly.  White pushes him out of the

     confession box, grabs his coat from behind, puts the gun to his

     back.  Together they head for the doors.  Still no sign of the

     Mystery Men.

                         PRIEST

               Donit kill me!

                         WHITE

               Shut up!

                         PRIEST

               Please...

     White loses his temper, grabs the priest, shakes him violently.

                         WHITE (not so quietly)

               Iim not going to kill you, okay!

     Faces turn.

     The priest kicks White in the leg, bites his hand.  While White

     is wincing in pain, the priest breaks away.

                         PRIEST (shouting/pointing)

               CRIMINAL!

     People start to scream and run.  The GAUNT WOMAN points at

     White.

                         GAUNT WOMAN (screams insanely)

               Itis him!  Rip out his eyes!

     Frightened, White holds the gun out.  Everyone panics,

     scatters.  People run for the exit.  Religious statues topple

     and smash.  The gaunt woman is pushed screaming to the floor,

     trampled by the crowd.

     Amidst the chaos, the two MYSTERY MEN appear across the room,

     see White, head towards him.  He turns and runs.

     A STAIRCASE

     White climbs narrow stairs rapidly.

     INT.  BELL TOWER

     White stops, nowhere left to go, just a long drop to the street

     through a series of arched windows.  A low, raftered room,

     three huge black BELLS.

     Suddenly a groan of gears in the ceiling and the bells start to

     swing, build momentum.

     CLANG!  CLA-A-A-ANG!  A cacophony of noise.

     White puts his hands over his ears in pain, then turns to the

     stairs.

     HIS P.O.V.

     Through the swinging bells  -  the MYSTERY MEN climb the last

     few steps on the other end of the dark room.  They advance

     slowly, clutching daggers.

     White raises his gun.  Aims.  Difficult to find his target  -

     the approaching MEN are obscured by the bells.

     White steps sideways, never taking his eyes off the Men.  They

     follow him slowly, pivoting about the bells in the centre of

     the tower, pursuers and pursued remaining a semi-circle apart.

                         WHITE (shouts)

               What do you want?  Tell me!

     The Men stop.  So does White.  They separate, now approaching

     him from OPPOSITE sides, moving around the bells.

     White doesnit know who to point the gun at  -  he swings back

     and forth, one to the other, faster and faster, as the Men

     approach.

     He lets them get uncomfortably close, then swings to his right,

     thrusts the gun to one Manis forehead.  FIRES.  The Man steps

     back, spouting liquid from the bullet hole, hits a low railing,

     FALLS into the shaft at the centre of the tower.

     The second Man SWINGS his dagger at White.

     White falls backwards, dropping his gun clumsily.  The Man

     advances, smiling  -  kicks the gun across the wooden floor.

     White, clutching at straws, lifts his foot, kicks down hard on

     a loose floorboard.  The board flies up, pivoting against

     Whiteis heel, catches the Mystery Man with a CRACK under the

     chin.

     White runs at the off-balance Man, head-butts him in the

     stomach.  The Man recoils, canit stop, steps off backwards into

     space, PLUMMETS INTO DARKNESS towards the street below.

     White relieved, turns, dusts himself, picks up his gun.  Looks

     down at the floor.  Broken glass and capsules everywhere  -  he

     dropped the bottle of pills during the scuffle.  Starts to pick

     them up.

     Behind him SOMETHING is rising.

     The shadowy Mystery Man is LEVITATING HIMSELF back up to the

     bell-tower.  He lands behind White, approaches, lifting his

     dagger, closer and closer.

     White glances around.

     The Man lunges, pushing White towards the shaft beneath the

     swinging bells.  White FALLS, dangles over dark space, the Man

     stands above him.

                         MYSTERY MAN (shouts)

               Do not make us hurt you...

     The bells are swinging very close to the Man.

                         MYSTERY MAN

               It will be inconvenient, yes...

     Suddenly, to Whiteis amazement, the shiny black rim of a bell

     clips the Manis head.  SLAMS it against a low wooden beam in

     the ceiling.  A splash of black liquid.  The Man slumps to the

     ground, his head crushed beyond recognition.

     White pulls himself up  -  stands over the Manis body, trying

     to decide what to do.  A MOVEMENT catches his eye.

     TIGHT ON the collapsed Manis ear  -  something moves inside.  A

     BLACK INSECT, half-dead, crawls out of his crushed head.

     White revolted, SQUASHES the insect under his shoe.

     EXT./INT.  VARIOUS  -  MONTAGE

     RAPID MOVE ACROSS MYSTERY MEN screaming.  Faces contort with

     pain.  INTERCUT WITH:

     Electricity ARCING between electrodes.

     A building against the sky.  The windows EXPLODE.  Glass blows

     out, raining down on the street.

     A concrete wall SPLITS OPEN.  Slime oozes through the crack.

     An old man, walks on a deserted street, looks up at the sky.

     One of the lenses of his spectacles CRACKS without warning.

     A chair falls over in a dark room.

     A woman under a hair-dryer gossips on a phone.  Suddenly the

     phone emits a high-pitched shriek.  Her ear spouts blood and

     she screams.

     A small transistor radio emits a high frequency and short

     circuits with a spark.

     EXT.  BUILDING

     TIGHT ON  -  a wristwatch spinning backwards rapidly  -

     completely haywire.

     INSPECTOR BUMSTEAD stands on a street corner staring blankly at

     his watch.  Taps it several times, annoyed, then looks up at a

     THREE STOREY BUILDING.  He holds a piece of paper in his other

     hand  -  on it a number rapidly scrawled:  23.

     HIS P.O.V.

     The dilapidated building  -  arched windows only on the topmost

     floor.  A faded number on the facade  -  also 23.  The windows

     light up continuously with rapid bursts of white light.

     INSIDE

     The inspector climbs a staircase, enters a dark room.

     TWO FIGURES move about.  Bumstead glances at a UNIFORMED MAN,

     standing beside a fake fire, who acknowledges his arrival.

     To the side, A POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER flashes something swinging

     back and forth, hanging from the ceiling.  It looks like...

     Fredrick.  Dead.  His arms and legs missing.  A pool of blood

     beneath the mutilated torso.

     Bumstead looks at the cop.

                         BUMSTEAD

               How long have you been here?

                         COP

               Maybe ten minutes...

                    (looks at his watch)

               Thatis strange.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Spinning backwards?

     The cop is shaking his watch, tapping it with his finger.  He

     looks up.  Bumstead indicates his own watch.

                         COP

               Yours too?

     Bumstead nods.  He removes a notebook from his pocket, walks

     about the room, glances at objects, makes notes.

     Bumstead steps over to a small RECTANGULAR HOLE in the wall.

     He examines it carefully, then bends down and puts his head

     through.  On the other side is a corridor snaking off into

     darkness.  Just beneath the hole, is a broken dish and a

     puddle.  Lying half in the puddle is the business card of

     Doctor D.P. Schreber M.D.

     Without removing his head from the hole he shouts to the nearby

     cop.

                         BUMSTEAD

               I want prints over here...

     Suddenly the door has caught Bumsteadis head in it.  He

     struggles.  The cop and the photographer run over to help.

     EXT.  BUILDING  -  NIGHT

     MOVE IN ON a doorway.  Above it a small illuminated red sign:

     DOCTOR D.P. SCHREBER M.D.

     REVERSE ANGLE ON WHITE

     He stands on the street, under the sign, rummaging in his

     wallet, obviously looking for the business card he doesnit have

     anymore.

     INT.  WAITING ROOM

     A white room, bare.  Dirt stains the walls near the air-vents.

     A NURSE is typing behind her desk.

     A THUMPING fills the room.  The nurse stands, removes her shoe

     and hits a pipe running along the wall several times.  The

     noise stops.

     The front door creaks open and White enters.  She watches him

     step into the room.

                         WHITE

               I want to see the doctor.  It's

               important.

                         NURSE

               What time was your appointment?

                         WHITE (angry)

               Look!  Tell him I'm here.  

Now

.

     He's leaning across her desk threateningly.

                         NURSE (scared/standing)

               Yes, certainly...  Who should I say?

                         WHITE

               No idea.  Just get him...

     Suddenly a door opens and DOCTOR SCHREBER, clutching a file of

     papers, steps out.  He freezes, stares at White.  The papers

     fall from his hands to the floor.

     INT.  DARK CHAMBER  -  NIGHT

     A group of DARK SILHOUETTES file into a concrete room.

     The MYSTERY MEN have gathered.  Like the Men who pursue White,

     they wear coats, leather gloves, dark glasses, and have near

     white skin.

     One MAN points to diagrams on a chalk board and speaks in the

     peculiar foreign tongue.

     TIGHT ON THE DIAGRAM  -  a path through the city.  A circle

     marks the point where the red line ends  -  a cathedral.  The

     Man goes into broken English  -  a guttural accent.

                         MAN 1

               It has failed.

     ANOTHER MAN stands at the rear of the room.

                         MAN 2

               This is becoming dangerous, yes!

     YET ANOTHER MAN starts to tremble violently, seized with some

     kind of convulsion.  He froths at the mouth and throws his head

     about.  A TALLER MAN standing beside him opens a silver box,

     removes a small WRITHING WORM.  He places this on the tip of

     the trembling Man's tongue, who swallows it and calms down.

                         MAN 3

               Let's get this over with.

     ANOTHER MAN rises suddenly, pushes forcefully to the front of

     the group.

                         MAN 5

               What about the dance-steps!  This is

               my responsibility, we must resolve

               this issue, yes?

     THE MEN turn to face him.  He is out of line.  He becomes

     irritated, as if to say something further, then pulls himself

     short, sits down.

                         MAN 5

               Sorry.

                         MAN 3

               The situation has changed.

                    (pacing the room)

               This one is in possession of

               knowledge...

                         MAN 1 (cuts in)

               ...to avoid influence, yes.

                         MAN 4

               A freak!

                         MAN 1

               Impossible!

     RUMBLING NOISE O.S. attracts everyone's attention.  They all

     look to a round portal high on a wall.  The noise is louder.

     several figures on stilts run past outside the opening  -  then

     the noise subsides.  The MYSTERY MEN go back to more important

     things.

                         MAN 3

               It gets interesting, yes.

                         MAN 2

               Stop this!  It has gone too far!

               Tell Mister Black!

     Man 2 stares blankly into space, he makes a peculiar clicking

     noise with his mouth, his eyes roll upwards.

     INT.  DOCTOR'S OFFICE

     THE CAMERA GLIDES down a corridor, towards a door  -  a sign

     says, DOCTOR IS:  IN.

     INSIDE

     White sits in a leather chair across from an ornate wooden

     desk.  THE DOCTOR paces up and down in front of glass jars

     containing preserved specimens.  He stops, looks at White.

                         SCHREBER

               You remember nothing?  Who you are?

               What you've done?

                         WHITE

               You know something about me?

                         SCHREBER

               Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't

               it?

                    (smiles)

               Is there nothing 

you

 remember?  Not

               even a detail?   You must try.

                         WHITE

               You think I haven't been trying!

                    (calms himself)

               It's like there was never anything

               there.

                    (pauses)

               Just water.

                         SCHREBER

               Water?

                         WHITE

               Waves...  A beach.  A woman

               whispering.  That's all.

                    (looks up, yawns)

               I need to stay awake.  Do you have

               any pills?

     The doctor walks to a glass cabinet and removes a bottle, takes

     out two green capsules.  Hands them to White.  Sits behind the

     desk again.

                         SCHREBER

               What does she say?  The woman.

                         WHITE

               Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just

               like a broken record.  Only thing is,

               I can't answer.  I've no idea what my

               name 

is

.

                         SCHREBER

               Your name is John White.

                         WHITE

               That's what people keep telling me.

     Te doctor walks to a small sink in the corner, returns, hands

     White a glass of water.  White swallows the pills.

                         SCHREBER  (indicates pills)

               And what's this about?  Why?

     White stands up, starts to pace nervously.

                         SCHREBER

               Bad dreams?

                         WHITE

               Yes.

                         SCHREBER

               Tell me about them...

                         WHITE (interrupts)

               Yeah well, why don't I ask some

               questions for a change.

                         SCHREBER

               If you like.

                         WHITE

               You're supposed to be my doctor,

               right?

                         SCHREBER

               That's right.  I 

am

 your doctor.

     White is very agitated now, his voice is getting edgy.

                         WHITE

               Known me for long?

                        SCHREBER

               Well...

                         WHITE (cuts in)

               Am I a killer?

                         SCHREBER

               I cannot say...  You don't know the

               answer to that?

                         WHITE

               I told you, I can't remember a thing!

     White reaches across abruptly, GRABS the doctor.

                         WHITE  (angry now  -  shouting)

               Look, you know something about me,

               out with it!  Let's end this

               bullshit!  I want answers!

     The doctor is obviously scared.

                         SCHREBER

               We won't get anywhere like this.

               Please.  Let's take things in easy

               steps...

     INT.  BUMSTEAD'S APARTMENT/KITCHEN  -  NIGHT

     TIGHT ON DRAWING PINS  -  Being pushed into a map.  A seeming

     random pattern across the terrain of the city.  Each pin is

     labelled:  VICTIM 1, VICTIM 2,...  etc.

     WIDER ON BUMSTEAD

     He's tired, like he hasn't slept.  He's looking at the map

     stuck to a wall.  There's several neat piles of folders on the

     kitchen table in front of him.  The kitchen itself is

     incredibly neat  -  everything completely organized.

     Bumstead shakes his head slowly, turns away from the board.

     Picks up a cup of hot tea, pours milk into it from a small jar.

     TIGHT ON THE TEA CUP  -  Cream SWIRLS into a rapidly dissolving

     spiral.  Bumstead looks up.  Puts down the cup hurriedly, turns

     back to the map.

     With a thick pen he traces a line between each point marking

     the location of the victims.  He steps back to examine his

     handiwork.

     A SPIRAL  -  moving outwards.  Beyond the last victim it

     becomes a dotted line, following the same trajectory but with a

     big question mark beside it.

     Bumstead glances over to a blackboard with a list of names and

     addresses on it.  He holds up the doctor's card and stares at

     it.  He turns it over, notices an address on the back.

     INT.  DOCTOR SCHREBER'S OFFICE  -  NIGHT

     SCHREBER is showing WHITE a series of CHARTS.  The doctor seems

     nervous about White's potential for further violence.

                         SCHREBER

               Put simply...  a penetration of the

               left parieto-occipital area of the

               cranium...  complicated by

               inflammation that resulted in

               adhesions of the brain to the

               meninges.  Without going into

               detail...  the formation of scar

               tissue altered the configuration of

               the lateral ventricles, producing

               incipient atrophy of the medulla...

                         WHITE (cuts in)

               Look.  It was a simple question.  Can

               someone kill and not remember it?

                         SCHREBER (smiles)

               I'm sorry.  I get carried away

               sometimes.  Possible?  I'm...  ah,

               afraid so.

                         WHITE

               Did she drown?  The woman you told me

               about?

                         SCHREBER

               Not exactly.  She was found in a

               canal, disembowelled.  Throat cut.

               Blood drained.  The body wrapped in a

               bed-sheet.

     White shakes his head, looking blankly at the doctor.

                         WHITE

               Horrible...

                         SCHREBER

               You remember nothing, eh?

                    (shakes his head)

               Let me show you something.

     Schreber turns, points to DOUBLE-DOORS.  He walks towards

     these.  White follows.

                         SCHREBER

               Formation of memories is the most

               important of brain functions.

     THE DOORS ARE OPENED

     They step into a room of living animal experiments.

                         SCHREBER

               We are little more than a sum of

               memories.  From them we reference who

               we are, where we're going.  Without a

               past we are nothing.  This is why you

               are so interesting.

                         WHITE

               I'm nothing then.

                         SCHREBER

               Anything 

but

, my friend.

     The two men look down on a monkey with the top of its head

     missing, squirming in a mechanical device that restricts its

     movements.

                         SCHREBER

               It feels no pain.

     White turns and starts to pace away.  Schreber reluctantly

     follows.

                         WHITE

               Can I get my life back?

                         SCHREBER

               Maybe.

     Schreber points dramatically at a wooden structure containing

     two rats.

                         SCHREBER

               We know of two kinds of memory.

               Firstly, declarative memory.

     The rats perform various activities involving mazes and

     geometric symbols.  Schreber turns to look at White, eyebrow

     raised.

                         SCHREBER

               And then there is procedural memory.

     TIGHT ON HIS SLENDER FINGER  -  pointing to a machine also run

     by rats.  The object is to make it through a guillotine device.

     One rat is successful, the other is chopped neatly in two.

                         SCHREBER

               Follow?

     White nods.

                         SCHREBER

               Research on simple animals can be...

               useful.  To show us where memory

               storing systems are located, for

               example.  I am building an experiment

               with hamsters next.

                    (looks at nearby cage

                    of hamsters)

               Cute little things.

     Schreber puts a hand on White's shoulder.

                         SCHREBER

               Listen to me talk!  You must be

               hungry.

     White nods again, extremely troubled.

     INT.  HALL-WAY (DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE)

     Schreber's office is an annex of his living quarters  -  a

     maze-like series of rooms and halls.  White is led down a dark

     hall by Schreber, clutching a candle.

                         SCHREBER

               Whole damn wing lost power.  Wiring's

               old.  Keep meaning to get it fixed.

               Here we are.

     They've stopped outside a flaking door.

     INT.  KITCHEN

     A small eat-in kitchen.  Dirty and run-down.  White, sits at a

     bench, as Schreber removes items from the refrigerator.  The

     doctor holds up a large FROZEN fish.

                         SCHREBER

               Ah.  Beautiful!  Head and all!  Just

               how I like 'em!

     ANGLE ON FRYING PAN ON STOVE  -  The fish lands in it and starts

     to sizzle furiously.

     ANGLE ON WHITE

                         WHITE

               I'm sorry.  About before.

                         SCHREBER

               I don't blame you for getting angry.

               You are in a frustrating situation.

               You must be patient though.  Trust me

               completely.  I'm here to help.

     A set of swinging doors on the other side of the room open

     slightly and THE NURSE looks in.

                         NURSE (to Schreber)

               I have to talk to you.

                         SCHREBER

               It can't wait?

     She shakes her head, with a serious expression, then darts out

     again.

                         SCHREBER  (to White)

               Excuse me.  Ah, make yourself at

               home.

     He leaves.

     Alone, White looks around the bleak room.  He takes off his

     coat and sits down again.  He removes the FISH.  The eye opens.

     The creature looks up at him.  It breaths painfully.

                         WHITE

               Still kicking, huh?

     He puts it back in his pocket.

     The OTHER fish is spattering oil everywhere.  Smoke starts to

     fill the room.  White, steps over and looks at the frying pan.

     The fish is turning black.  He turns the heat down.

     He notices a SMALL HOLE in the wall.  At eye height.  He steps

     across, looks through.

     TIGHT ON WHITE'S eye through the hole.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A dark room.  Shadows on the wall.  Something wet, some kind of

     ANIMAL, moving in the darkness.  He can hear breathing and

     whispering voices.

     White's eyes start to blur, he rubs them.

                         SCHREBER O.S.

               How are things in here?

     White spins, like he's caught doing something wrong.  The

     Doctor walks across to the stove, prods the frying fish with a

     fork.

                         SCHREBER

               Ah, nearly done.  So tell me about

               your dreams.  I'm very interested.

     White is having a hard time focusing.

                         WHITE

               Just the typical fabrications of a

               distorted mind.  You know, chased by

               mysterious men in black, that kind of

               thing...

     WHITE'S P.O.V.  -  ANGLE ON Schreber with his back turned, at

     the stove.  THE IMAGE is blurring.

                         SCHREBER

               Ah, our friends in black...  they are

               not just a figment of your

               imagination you know, in fact none of

               what you are experiencing is anything

               but real.

     Smoke rises thickly around the doctor.

                         SCHREBER

               I know everything about you.  You

               have no choice but to trust me.

     Flames are shooting up around Schreber from the frying pan.

     His arms catch fire, and he suddenly spins around clutching

     flaming daggers in both hands, his whole body engulfed in fire,

     his face charred, black flesh hanging off his skull.

                         SCHREBER

               Scarey, isn't it?

     White startles awake.

     Schreber stands at the stove looking at White.  Everything is

     normal.

                         SCHREBER

               Are you feeling alright?

     White stands awkwardly, pulls his coat on.

                         SCHREBER

               What are you doing?

                         WHITE

               I have to go...

                         SCHREBER

               You can't go yet.  We've got so much

               to talk about...

     Suddenly White feels feint  -  leans against the wall to steady

     himself.

                         SCHREBER

               You're tired.  You need to lie down.

     ON WHITE  -  swaying.

                         WHITE

               Those pills...

     HIS P.O.V.

     The scene is distorted  -  like looking through water.  Things

     start SPINNING.

                         SCHREBER (echoic)

               Yes.  A little something to help you

               relax.  Harmless...

     A tile floor RISES rapidly TOWARDS CAMERA.

                                              CUT TO:

     GREY LIMBO

     Objects float underwater.  They rise upwards amidst bubbles,

     break the surface.  A storm at sea  -  dismembered BODY PARTS

     float all the way to the horizon.

     TWO FOETUSES in separate jars are talking to each other through

     the glass.

                         FOETUS 1

               This is madness.  If we're caught...

                         FOETUS 2

               Shut-up.  Help me with these

               straps...

     INT.  EXAMINATION ROOM

     WHITE wakes strapped to an exantination table.  SCHREBER and the

     NURSE loom above him.  The nurse hands Schreber a long, chrome

     SYRINGE.  The doctor moves towards White.

                         SCHREBER (holds syringe up)

               Now you must relax, Anton.

     A DOOR-BELL RINGS O.S. The nurse makes for the door.

                         SCHREBER

               Leave it!

     He's tapping the side of the syringe, squirting out air

     bubbles.  THE DOOR-BELL RINGS again  -  very insistent.

     Schreber looks at the nurse, annoyed.

                         SCHREBER

               Damn!  Whoever it is  -  get rid of

               them!

     She heads to the door  -  turns back.

                         NURSE

               Keys.

     Schreber puts the syringe down, fumbles in his pocket, pulls

     out a huge collection of KEYS on a ring, walks to the nurse,

     hands them to her.

     White manages to wriggle a hand free from the leather strap

     holding him.  The nurse leaves, the doctor shuts the door,

     locks it.  He steps over to White.

                         SCHREBER

               I'm sorry I had to put you through

               this, Anton.

                    (lowers syringe to

                    White's forehead)

               There will be some pain, but things

               will be easier this way.

     White lashes out, PUNCHES the doctor in the face.  His glasses

     go flying, and he falls to the floor, blinded, scrambling for

     the spectacles.

     A convenient scalpel cuts White from his remaining bonds.  He

     undoes the last strap around his ankles as the doctor replaces

     his glasses and leaps at him trying to drive the syringe INTO

     WHITE'S FOREHEAD.

     The struggle continues  -  each man tries to turn the syringe

     on the other.  White pushes the doctor, who falls backwards.

     Schreber leaps onto him, both fall against a tray of medical

     instruments.

     A loud THUMPING on the examination room door.  White is grabbed

     from behind, pinned down with the syringe INCHES from his face.

     A CRASH O.S.  Splintering wood.  The door bursts open.

     A ROTUND SILHOUETTE  -  is revealed, clutching a police

     special, flashing a badge.  A squeaky, over-excited, voice:

                         BUMSTEAD

               Hold it!

     Schreber and White FREEZE in mid-struggle, look at the

     inspector.  Behind him, the nurse appears in the hallway.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Police.  Nobody move.

                         SCHREBER

               He tried to kill me!

                         BUMSTEAD

               Shut up!  Everybody stay calm...

     Bumstead steps into the light, shoves his gun in White's face,

     handcuffs him.  Bumstead searches White, finds the revolver,

     takes this.  Also takes his wallet.  He glances at the doctor,

     who hides the syringe behind his back.

                         BUMSTEAD (to Doctor)

               You Schreber?

     Schreber nods blankly.

     Bumstead runs his hand over White's side pocket  -  feels

     something.

                         BUMSTEAD

               What's that?

     White says nothing.  The inspector opens the pocket and looks

     in.

                         BUMSTEAD (disgusted)

               A fish, huh?

     EXT.  CITY STREETS  -  NIGHT

     An old-fashioned BLACK SEDAN drives over a rusty suspension

     bridge.  Stone gargoyles look down at the lone vehicle.  It's

     been raining.  Streets are empty.

     INSIDE THE CAR

     WHITE and the INSPECTOR drive silently.  Bumstead has appointed

     his un-marked police vehicle with all the comforts of home.

     Hot thermos.  Note pad holder, complete with light.  Coat

     hanger.  Gun rack.  A system for everything.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Dammit!

                    (glances at his

                    watch)

               I'm curious?  How many so far?

     He shakes his watch, puts it to his ear.

                         WHITE (confused)

               What?  I...

                         BUMSTEAD (counts on fingers)

               Let's see, there's the little guy

               with no arms or legs.  And the young

               boy?

                         WHITE (disturbed)

               Young boy?

     CLOSE ON WHITE  -  frightened now.

                         BUMSTEAD

               The six year old.  Sure, you

               remember.

     Bumstead pulls something from under the dashboard.  A SANDWICH,

     carefully wrapped and prepared.  After glancing at his watch

     again, he bites into it.

                         BUMSTEAD (chewing)

               Y'know, the kid you left in the meat

               packing plant, cut into pieces.

               Packed into brown paper parcels,

               wrapped in twine, that kind of thing.

     No answer.

                         BUMSTEAD

               You sure have demonstrated a great

               deal of...  imagination.  The baby

               was the best though.  Several cops

               lost their lunch over that one.  Head

               twisted off, spine pulled out,

               yeech...

                         WHITE (cuts in)

               Stop it.  You're making me sick...

                         BUMSTEAD

               We count seven so far.  Anyone we

               missed?

     RADIO CRACKLE O.S.  -  A tinny voice cuts in.

                         VOICE

               Inspector Bumstead...  Inspector...

     Bumstead picks up a microphone, speaks into it.

                         BUMSTEAD

               What is it, Crenshaw?

                         CRENSHAW

               Just reminding you...  your eight pee

               em...

                         BUMSTEAD

               Dammit.

                    (looks at watch)

               Very efficient, as usual, Crenshaw.

               Remind me to give you my watch.  It

               needs fixing.

                         CRENSHAW

               Yes sir.

     Bumstead replaces the microphone under the dashboard, takes a

     SHARP CORNER as he finishes off the sandwich.

                         WHITE

               Where are we going?

                         BUMSTEAD

               Shut-up.

     Burastead pulls out a small brush, cleans the fallen crumbs from

     his trousers, keeping a hand on the wheel.

     White is silent  -  his wounds continue to bother him.  He

     leans down to scratch through his trousers.

                         WHITE (quietly)

               Shit!

                         BUMSTEAD

               Gesundheit!

                         WHITE (looks up)

               I didn't sneeze.

     EXT.  HOSPITAL ENTRANCE  -  NIGHT

     The INSPECTOR's car pulls up and stops.

     INSIDE THE CAR

                         WHITE

               What are we doing here?

     Bumstead grabs a bunch of flowers off the back seat.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Get out.

     INT.  HOSPITAL  -  NIGHT

     BUMSTEAD pushes the handcuffed WHITE through a swinging metal

     door.  They enter a sterile air-conditioned room.  An

     effeminate MALE NURSE sits behind a glassed-in counter.

     Directly opposite is a small WAITING ROOM through a glass

     panelled door.  Bumstead pushes White into this room.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Wait here.

     The inspector shuts the door behind him.  White looks about the

     blank room, takes a seat.  He can see Bumstead, through the

     glass panel in the door, walk up to the male nurse opposite.

     OUT IN THE CORRIDOR

     The inspector talks to the male nurse through a tiny opening in

     the window.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Bumstead.  I'm here to see my mother.

     BACK TO WHITE

     He cannot hear anything of what Bumstead is saying.  He sees

     him take out his wallet and show his badge.  The male nurse is

     concerned, looks over towards White, then opens a drawer, hands

     Bumstead a KEY.  The inspector steps back to the waiting room

     door and LOCKS IT from the outside.  He looks at White for a

     moment, then walks away, along the corridor.

     INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM

     Bumstead enters darkness  -  pneumatic MACHINE NOISE fills the

     gloom.  He walks quietly to his mother, encased in a metallic

     contraption, something like an iron lung.

                         BUMSTEAD (whisper)

               Brought you these.

     He places flowers on the bedside table.  His mother just stares

     expressionless into space, in a coma.  He sits on a metal

     chair, looks at the woman.  Her life-sustaining machines hiss

     and breathe.

     INT.  POLICE STATION

     A FINGER presses down on the sticky surface of a page.  It

     pulls away revealing an inky finger-print.

     WIDER

     White is standing in a bare room, in front of a finger-printing

     machine.  He's alone.  A blast of electrical FEED-BACK.  White

     looks up at a speaker mounted to the wall.

                         MECHANICAL VOICE  (through speaker)

               Move  -  forward.

     White follows a painted line on the floor, stands against a

     wall, in front of an old-fashioned camera.  A slot opens in the

     wall behind him, mechanical arms spring forward, restrain him,

     one arm holds a sign with a number in front of him.  A flash

     goes off, the click of a shutter.

                         MECHANICAL VOICE

               Left  -  profile.

     A claw lowers from the ceiling, grips White's head, turns it

     abruptly  -  the camera fires.

                         MECHANICAL VOICE

               Right  -  profile.

     The claw turns his head the other way.  The camera fires again.

                         MECHANICAL VOICE

               Move  -  forward.

     Across the room A BUZZER SOUNDS, a red light flashes above a

     door.  White is released by the mechanical hands, walks over,

     opens the door and steps into darkness.

     LIGHTS COME ON  -  extremely bright.  A room for line-ups  -

     markings on the white wall behind White indicate varying

     heights, a darkened window faces him.  He is obviously to be

     identified by an unseen person.

     A buzzer sounds again, a light indicates another door.

                         VOICE

               Move  -  forward.

     White moves into another room.  A chair faces a large wheel

     painted in a black and white spiral.  He sits down  -  the

     wheel turns, faster and faster.

                         VOICE

               Watch  -  the  - wheel.

     The wheel stops after several seconds.

                         VOICE

               Move  -  forward.

     The next room is full of scientific equipment.

                         VOICE

               Stand  -  behind  -  the  -  screen.

     White sees a metal-frame X-ray machine  -  he steps across to

     it.  The screen lights up, filling the room with a green glow.

     We can see the shape of his skeleton.  Where his pocket would

     be, is the tiny skeleton of the fish.

                         VOICE

               Move  -  forward.

     The next room is empty.

                         VOICE

               Face  -  the  - wall.

     White turns.  As soon as he has done this hears a door open

     behind him.  FOOTSTEPS approach.  Blows rain down on him, fists,

     boots, clubs.  He slides to the floor.  The lights go out.

     INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM

     LIGHTS come on again.  White is dazed  -  in a chair, a bright

     light in his face blinds him.

                         VOICE

               What's your name?

                         WHITE  (squints into light)

               I don't remember.

                         VOICE

               Oh, no?

     White shakes his head slowly and looks at the floor.  The light

     is angled away, pointed down towards A TABLE.  White can see

     now.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A featureless room.  STROMBOLI stands over him, behind him is

     BUMSTEAD and two shadowy guards.  Bumstead picks up an

     envelope, removes a SERIES OF PHOTOS, hands these to Stromboli.

                         STROMBOLI

               John...

     He throws the first shot down on the table in front of White.

     A black and white police photo of a murder victim.

                         STROMBOLI

               ...Murderer.

     Another photo goes down.  Another victim.  Another and another.

     Each more grisly than the last.

                         STROMBOLI

               You'll sign a confession?

     White nods.  He's looks utterly lost.

     Bumstead steps across to a small speaker box on the wall near

     the only door, presses a button.

                         BUMSTEAD (into speaker)

               Okay.

     TWO GUARDS immediately step through the door, GRAB White by his

     arms.  They carry him off.

     INT.  PRISON CELL

     White is woken by a UNIFORMED GUARD shining a light in his

     eyes.

                         GUARD

               Visitor.

     INT.  VISITING ROOM

     White is led into an empty pale green room with a glass barrier

     down the middle.  The guard tells him to sit and wait.

     The door on the other side of the barrier opens with a squeak  -

     DOCTOR SCHREBER steps in, looking frightened.

                         WHITE  (to guard)

               Keep him away:  He's insane.

     The guard just smiles, looks at the doctor knowingly.

                         SCHREBER

               Please, stay calm.

                         WHITE  (to guard)

               This man wants to kill me.

     The guard remains indifferent.

                         SCHREBER  (to guard)

               Just one of his many delusions  -

               it's nothing.

                    (a whisper to White)

               Shut up!  Listen, damn you!  This is

               a fortunate coincidence  -  we won't

               get another chance like this.  Listen

               to me.

                         WHITE  (turns to Doctor)

               What do you want?

                         SCHREBER

               You're innocent...

                    (still a whisper)

               You didn't kill anyone.

                         WHITE  (sarcastic)

               What am I doing in 

here

 then?

                         SCHREBER

               Listen to what I have to say.  Decide

               for yourself.

     AN ADJOINING ROOM

     The dark silhouettes of BUMSTEAD and ANOTHER COP watch from

     behind a two-way mirror.

                         BUMSTEAD

               What's he doing here?

                         COP

               Says he is the man's doctor...

                    (taps side of his

                    head)

               You know...

                         BUMSTEAD

               I 

know

 it's his doctor...

                    (into intercom)

               I need the file on..

                    (reads clip-board)

               Daniel Paul Schreber M.D.

                         MISS CRENSHAW'S VOICE O.S.

               Schreber.  Yes.  Isn't that his

               doctor?

                         BUMSTEAD (evenly)

               Yes.

                    (beat)

               And it's 

SCHREBER

  -  with an 'h'.

                         MISS CRENSHAW

               Yes.  An "h".

     The inspector looks up from the speaker.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  THROUGH THE MIRROR, White seems to have calmed

     down.

     BACK IN THE VISITING ROOM

                         SCHREBER

               The men in black  -  they're the

               killers.

     White stands abruptly, pushes himself against the glass.

                         WHITE

               You're a liar!

                         SCHREBER

               No, it's the truth.

                         WHITE

               So you're telling me the truth 

this

               time?  Is that it!

     The doctor removes a SMALL SYRINGE from his black bag, places

     it on the table in front of the glass, blocks it from the

     guard's view.

                         SCHREBER

               If you would only take this, inject

               it in your brain, everything would be

               much clearer.

                         WHITE

               Not that again...

                         SCHREBER

               Everyone get's one  -  very much like

               this...

                    (points to syringe)

               But this one's special.  It will help

               you understand, everything...

                         WHITE (cuts in)

               I'm not injecting anything into my

               brain.

                         SCHREBER

               Anton  -  I mean, John, there

               has been an experiment, a dangerous

               experiment.  I arranged it.  It was a

               lie from the beginning.  It almost

               worked, but things did not go as they

               should have.  You have been left  -

               blank.

     Schreber waves frantically at the air surrounding him.

                         SCHREBER

               You can change this, 

all

 this.

                    (points at syringe

                    again)

               But you 

must

 take it.

     White stares blankly at him for a moment, then:

                         WHITE

               You've been working too hard.

                         SCHREBER

               Please!  Don't be foolish!  Time is

               short.  Let me show you something.

               Look at this syringe.

                         WHITE

               Why?

                         SCHREBER

               Don't ask stupid questions.  Look at

               it.

     White reluctantly does this.

                         SCHREBER

               Concentrate.  Imagine the syringe

               rising.  Picture it floating above the

               table.

     TIGHT ON WHITE

                         SCHREBER

               Do it!

     WHITE'S P.O.V.

     The syringe starts to vibrate, actually RISES INTO THE AIR  -

     floats stationary between White and Schreber.

                         WHITE

               It's a trick.

                         SCHREBER

               No it isn't.  

You

 are doing it!  Now

               raise it over the glass and...

     Suddenly the syringe spins towards the doctor, IMPALES itself

     in his shoulder.  He yelps, grabs it.

                         WHITE

               Oh, sorry...

     The doctor pulls out the syringe, is about to say more when a

     BUZZER SOUNDS.

                         MECHANICAL VOICE

               Your  -  time  -  is  -  up.

     Schreber looks to where the voice came from  -  a speaker above

     their heads.

                         SCHREBER (looks at White)

               I gave you your chance, now it's too

               late.  They'll learn you are here

               soon.  It's all over.

     INT.  POLICE STATION CORRIDOR

     DOCTOR SCHREBER paces towards the exit.  BUMSTEAD steps in

     front of him.  The doctor is startled.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Doctor!  What brings you here?

                         SCHREBER

               Just visiting my patient.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Really?  And how is his state of

               mind?

                         SCHREBER

               He's seriously disturbed...

     The doctor is nervous, glancing about.

                         BUMSTEAD

               You seem a little edgy.  Everything

               okay?

                         SCHREBER

               Yes, of course.  Everything's fine...

     He tries to push past.  Bumstead grabs his arm.

                         BUMSTEAD

               To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've

               run into each other like this.  Maybe

               you can help me tidy some loose ends.

                         SCHREBER

               Loose ends?

     SCHREBER looks like a trapped animal, when:

                         VOICE O.S.

               Bumstead!

     Bumasead turns to look down the corridor.  He sees STROMBOLI

     peaking out of his office door.

                         STROMBOLI

               I need to speak to you.  Immediately.

     The door shuts again.  Bumstead turns back.  The doctor is GONE

     -  the corridor empty.

     INT.  HOLDING CELL

     White is staring through a glass door at A COP.  A KETTLE

     WHISTLES O.S.  The cop gets up and moves off.

     White looks up.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A small WINDOW, high up on the wall.  Impossible to get to,

     even if his hands weren't cuffed.  Nothing he can do  -  he

     looks at a clock on a wall.

     PUSH IN on the clock  -  TICKING GETS LOUDER.

     INT.  POLICE STATION

     BUMSTEAD enters STROMBOLI'S office.  A nervous CHIEF-INSPECTOR

     is flanked by TWO STRANGE-LOOKING MEN in ill-fitting brown

     suits.

                         STROMBOLI

               Bumstead, these...  er, gentlemen are

               here to collect White.

     Bumstead suspiciously eyes the two men, beside STROMBOLI'S

     desk.

                         BUMSTEAD  (to men)

               Who are you?

                         STROMBOLI (even more nervous)

               Please, Bumstead.  Co-operate  -

               it's easier.

                         BUMSTEAD

               This is highly irregular.  I have a

               right to know.

                         MAN 1

               We are from a mental asylum.

     He notices that this man's moustache is LOP-SIDED.  The other

     man wears spectacles WITH NO LENSES in the frames, clutches an

     un-lit pipe in his teeth.

                         STROMBOLI

               Yes.  That's right.  He's ill  -  he

               needs expert help.

                         BUMSTEAD

               I see...

                         MAN 1

               Yes, Inspector.  Has he been

               displaying any strange...  behaviour?

                         BUMSTEAD

               He's been a little angel...

                         STROMBOLI

               If you could show them to the holding

               cell now.

     SLOW MOVE IN on Bumstead's face.

     IN THE CORRIDOR

     Bumstead and the MYSTERY MEN walk towards the holding cell.

     Bumstead glances up through the glass in the door before he

     enters.  IT'S EMPTY.

     He fumbles furiously for the key in his pocket  -  BURSTS into

     the room.  White is gone.  But where?  Bumstead throws a look

     back TO THE FRONT DESK.

                         MAN 1

               Where is he?

     The cop is just returning, holding a cup of coffee.  He looks

     at the inspector, sees the room is empty.  A nervous twitch

     knocks the cup from the cop's hands.

     TIGHT ON THE CUP  -  smashing on the floor.

     INT.  SUBWAY STATION  -  NIGHT

     Underground.  CONSTANT NOISE O.S. of trains arriving and

     departing but none are seen.

     CAMERA MOVES PAST broken tiles on a wall to REVEAL:  WHITE  -

     sitting amidst rubbish on the ground, looking around, confused,

     groggy from sleep.  He looks down at his hands, unsuccessfully

     tries to free them from the cuffs.

     MOVE IN TIGHT ON WHITE

     He starts to cry.  He puts his head in his hands, his body

     spasms with each sob.

     SEVERAL ANGLES of the empty corridors of the subway.  White's

     crying is heard  -  echoic.

     BACK ON WHITE  -  A small feminine HAND touches his head.

     Startled, he throws himself back, like he's about to be

     attacked.

     THE BEAUTIFUL JAPANESE WOMAN from the church looks down at him.

     INT.  POLICE STATION

     BUMSTEAD and the COP are getting grilled by STROMBOLI.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Yes, sir.  I'm sorry...  But I don't

               understand how it was possible.  The

               only window was twenty feet up a

               vertical wall, he was cuffed...

                         STROMBOLI

                    (shouts at cringing

                    COP)

               How could you have been so stupid?

                         COP

               I'm sorry, sir.

                         STROMBOLI

               Alright, get out.

     Bumstead gets up and leaves.

                         STROMBOLI

               You stay.

     The cop hustles out, shuts the door.

                         STROMBOLI

               Bumstead, you're starting to annoy

               me.  This case is very important to

               me.  Just a little warning:  I've got

               my eye on you inspector, remember

               that.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Yes, sir.

     He leaves.

     INT.  APARTMENT BUILDING

     White, awkwardly trying to hide his cuffed hands in his coat,

     follows the JAPANESE WOMAN up a flight of dark stairs.  she

     keeps looking back at him, smiling but SAYS NOTHING.

     INT.  APARTMENT

     White and the woman step into a run-down apartment.  She points

     to a couch.  White looks uncomfortable.  She smiles again, then

     turns on the radio.  MUSIC.

     She steps into an adjoining bedroom, leaving White alone.  He

     gets up and starts to tune the radio.  A babble of fragments of

     voices and music, then:  A NEWS REPORT...

                         NEWS READER O.S.

               ...earlier this evening it was

               reported a man fitting his

               description had been apprehended.

     White listens nervously.

                         NEWS READER O.S.

               ...and now for a message from LUMP-O

               food products...

     Across the room he can see the woman's bedroom door ajar.  He

     crosses to the doorway and looks in.  The woman stands naked

     against a deep red wall, her back turned.  She has an elaborate

     TATTOO on her back  -  looks like an INSECT.  She puts on a

     dressing gown and TURNS SUDDENLY.

     White steps back before she notices him, he goes back to the

     couch.

     She steps from the doorway holding a BAR OF SOAP in her hand.

     She sits down beside White and takes his hands, gently

     lathering soap around the handcuffs, continuing to smile at

     him.  White looks down.

     His hands seem to have SHRUNK  -  they poke out of his sleeves

     like tiny children's limbs.  The cuffs effortlessly slip off.

     White looks at the woman, then back at his hands  -  NOTHING

     STRANGE, they are normal size, but somehow the cuffs have been

     removed.  He looks at the woman again, grateful.  He can't help

     smiling.

     HIS P.O.V.

     Her eyes.  Her lips.  Her neck.  She leans forward, goes OUT OF

     FOCUS.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     She touches her tongue to his lips.  Kisses his face.  She

     pushes him back on the couch and pulls her dressing gown open.

     White does not respond  -  seems uncertain.  She sits upright,

     astride his body, unbuckles his belt, opens his shirt, caresses

     his chest.  She stops, her face in shadow.

     Slowly, White lifts his hands to her breasts, touches them.

     She starts to breath deeply.

     OUT OF FOCUS  -  their bodies entangle, begin to move

     rhythmically.  The CAMERA TRACKS SIDEWAYS, REVEALS a microphone

     behind a chair, leads us to a mirror on a wall.  On the other

     side of the one-way glass a reel-to-reel tape recorder is

     picking up the SOUNDS OF HEAVY BREATHING.

     OUTSIDE

     The building the lovers are in SLOWLY RISES into the air, past

     taller buildings and floats out over the city.  Its shadow

     moves past empty plazas and across faces of grey towers.

     INSIDE

     White sleeps, as buildings move past outside the window.  He

     opens his eyes, FORCES himself awake.  Looks across the dark

     room.

     The JAPANESE WOMAN stands naked at the window, clutching a

     large red megaphone.  IN PERFECT ENGLISH she shouts down at the

     streets drifting past.

                         JAPANESE WOMAN

               He's up here!  He raped me!  Hurry!

               Before he kills again!

     OUTSIDE

     MYSTERY MEN stand on roof-tops, watching the building drift

     past.

     BACK IN THE ROOM

     White runs to the window, GRABS the woman.  As they struggle,

     the building is landing softly in another part of the city.

     LONG SHADOWS move towards the entrance...

     WHITE WAKES UP AGAIN  -  finds he is still on the couch.  NO

     SIGN of the woman.  Then he notices her standing by the window

     (minus megaphone).  The wind pulls at her black hair.  A

     distant SIREN O.S.

     He gets up, walks over, stands beside her, looks out at the

     dark city.  She ignores him, goes back to the couch, turns on a

     table-lamp, puts her hands before the lit bulb, casts animal

     shadows on the wall.

     White watches her.  He walks across and sits next to her.  She

     points to herself.

                         WOMAN  (a whisper)

               Sachiko.

     He nods slowly, looks at her.  She waits for him to respond

     with his name.  He shrugs, remains silent.  Then he puts his

     hands in the light, makes his own animal shadow.

                         WHITE

               That's me.  I'm a shadow.

     She smiles at the shadows.

                         WHITE

               Do I look like a murderer to you?

     She just keeps smiling, not understanding.  Kisses him. He

     notices an old phone on a corner table, removes the note again

     and rings the same number.  This time, after several rings the

     call is answered.

                         WOMAN'S VOICE O.S.

               Yes?...  Who is this?...  Who's

               there?...

     White remains silent.  Sachiko stands and leaves the room.

                         WOMAN'S VOICE O.S.

John

?  Is that you?

                         WHITE

               Who is this?  What do you know about

               me?

     In the darkness of a doorway Sachiko hesitates momentarily.

     She slides a hand into White's coat, removes the wallet.  She

     takes out some cash, puts the wallet back, then she MOVES OFF.

     EXT.  STREET  -  NIGHT

     BUMSTEAD pulls up in his car.  Across the street is DOCTOR

     SCHREBER'S surgery.

     He is about to get out of the car, when the SURGERY DOOR OPENS

     and A FIGURE steps into the street.  Bumstead watches the

     shadowy man for a moment.  Then gets out and FOLLOWS, assuming

     it is Schreber.

     ALLEYWAY

     Bumstead follows inconspicuously.  Without warning, the figure

     stops and TURNS.  Bumstead backs into a doorway to hide.  He

     gets a glimpse of the gaunt features of a MYSTERY MAN in the

     dim light of the alley.

     When Bumstead steps into the alley again there is no sign of

     the Man  -  like he disappeared into thin air.  A SHADOW

     crosses the wall beside Bumstead.  He spins, looking around

     behind him.  Then he looks up into the air.

     HIS P.O.V.

     The shadow of a LEVITATING FIGURE crosses the face of a

     building.

     INT.  APARTMENT BUILDING PASSAGEWAY  -  NIGHT

     SOUND OF A WOMAN SOBBING O.S.  A wet dog sits in a corner

     gnawing a bone.  A crackly voice recites a list of names from a

     small speaker-box mounted to a wall.  A TREMBLING FINGER

     presses a door buzzer.

     SACHIKO, opens the door and looks out.

     ANGLE ON  -  A STRANGE WOMAN in the dark corridor adjusting her

     hair nervously.  She pushes past the Japanese woman, into the

     room.

     INSIDE

                         WOMAN

               John.

     WHITE stands inside the room, looking at the woman,

     expressionless. The woman suddenly leaps forward, grabs him,

     kisses him passionately.

     White tries to push her away, but she takes his hand, pulls it

     inside her dress, makes him touch her breasts.  He pushes

     harder, she trips on a chair, falls to the floor.  She starts

     to cry.

     EXT.  APARTMENT BUILDING FACADE

     The CAMERA MOVES past flaking bricks  -  to a window.  Behind

     the glass WHITE and SACHIKO sit across from the WOMAN who

     attacked White.  She is talking, though nothing can be heard,

     drying her eyes with a handkerchief.

     INSIDE

     The strange woman looks at White intently between sobs.

                         WOMAN

               Please believe me.  It's 

me

, John.

               Your 

WIFE

.  I wouldn't lie to you.

               You told me I could come and see you

               -  now you want to just send me away

               again...

     White looks AT THE FLOOR.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  a crack in the floorboards  -  movement

     underneath.

                         WHITE

               I thought it would make more sense.

               I'm getting the pieces, but when I

               put it together it feels like...

               Like you're telling me about somebody

               else's life...

                         WIFE

               It's the truth...  I need you.  I

               know you're innocent.

                         WHITE

               How do you know I'm innocent?

                         WIFE

               Of course you are.  You couldn't do

               those terrible things.  Come home with

               me  -  maybe things will make sense

               then...

                         WHITE

               I can't do that.  It's dangerous.

               What about my parents?  Do you know

               where I can find them?

                         WIFE

               They're dead, John.

     He stands and walks to the window  -  looks out at the city.

                         WIFE

               You have an uncle.  You were very

               close.

     She fumbles in her handbag, pulls out a notebook, scribbles

     something on a piece of paper, hands it to White.

                         WIFE

               This is where he lives. I'm sure he

               would like to see you.

                         WHITE (taking paper)

               Thanks.

                         WIFE (looks at him for a beat)

               Don't you want me?   My body?

               Remember how my skin feels?  Touch

               it.  I...

     She notices Sachiko  -  becomes self-conscious.  Sachiko

     silently stands and leaves the room.  The wife puts her face in

     her hands, overcome with tears.

                         WHITE

               What's your name?

                         WIFE  (looks up  -  still sobbing)

               Elizabeth.

     White removes the torn fragment of the photograph he has in his

     wallet, holds the black and white eye up to her face  -  it

     matches.

                         WHITE  (thoughtful)

               Yes...

     In the darkness of a doorway Sachiko watches the couple.  She

     MOVES OFF.

                         ELIZABETH

               I want to help...

                         WHITE

               Alright.  Here...

     He pulls the postcard from his wallet, holds it up so the woman

     can see it.

                         WHITE

               Know this place?

     She looks at the card.

                         ELIZABETH  (stops crying)

               Of course.  Your home town  -  where

               you grew up...

     White stands abruptly, startling the woman.  He glares down at

     her intensely.

                         WHITE

               How do I get there?  Tell me.

                         WIFE

               That's easy.  You...

     She trails off into silence.  Her hand, about to point in a

     certain direction, freezes in mid-air.

                         ELIZABETH

               ...strange, I forgot.

     White sits back down quietly.

                         WHITE

               Yes.  

Very

 strange.

     INT.  BATHROOM

     Sachiko locks the door behind her and steps to the middle of

     the room, lifts a small round rug off the tiled floor.

     Underneath is a TRAP-DOOR.  Opening it, she climbs down a

     hole.

     UNDER THE FLOOR

     In the semi-darkness she moves to a WOODEN BOX.  She cranks a

     small metal handle on the box which makes the lid open.  Music

     plays softly.

     She looks into the yawning black mouth of the box.  A WORM-LIKE

     apparition threads its way out of the hole, wraps about her

     thigh.  She breaths deeply, shuts her eyes.

     INT.  TENEMENT BUILDING CORRIDOR

     LOW ANGLE TRACKING SHOT  -  feet walk along a tattered rug,

     approach a door.  Bumstead's shoes, shiny as always.

     INT.  TENEMENT ROOM

     A KNOCK ON THE DOOR startles a huddled man in a blanket,

     sitting before a small t.v. set.  This is THOMPSON  -  the

     detective with mental problems.  He's unshaven, haunted.

     Clutching a shotgun, he steps to the door, peeks through a spy-

     hole.

     HIS P.O.V.

     Bumstead, back turned, glancing at his watch.

     Thompson backs away, points his gun at the figure through the

     door.

                         THOMPSON

               Go away!

                         BUMSTEAD O.S.

               Open up, Thompson.  It's me...

     Thompson puts his eye to the door again.

                         THOMPSON

               Bumstead?

     THROUGH THE SPY-HOLE LENS the inspector turns, looks at us, his

     face DISTORTED, fish-like.  Thompson undoes four locks, opens

     the door a crack, but leaves it chained.

                         THOMPSON

               Can't let you in...  sorry.

                         BUMSTEAD

               I'm on the serial killer case, need

               to talk.

                         THOMPSON

               Not that.  Anything else.

     Thompson wipes at the sweat on his forehead.

                         BUMSTEAD

               You don't look so well...  C'mon, let

               me in Thompson.

     Thompson stares at Bumstead, then silently unchains the door

     and lets him through.

                         THOMPSON

               I can't talk about 

that

.  As long as

               you understand, that's all.

     The room is very dark.  Bumstead is assailed by a wave of

     putrid smells.  It's a mess  -  rotten food, overturned

     furniture, dirty clothes.

                         THOMPSON

               Pull up some garbage  -  make

               yourself at home.

     Thompson smiles weakly.  They sit down, face each other in the

     gloom.  A RAT scuttles past Thompson.  With lightning reflexes

     he throws a shoe at it.  The rat runs under a table.  He looks

     back at Bumstead, smiles, slightly insane.

                         THOMPSON

               They've taken my mind, my memories...

                         BUMSTEAD

               What?  Who has?

                         THOMPSON

               Is that your idea of a joke?  I don't

               remember...

                    (looks around)

               Take my advice, Bumstead.  Get off

               this case.  Now.

                         BUMSTEAD

               What is going on?

                         THOMPSON (looks more frightened)

               Wish I could tell you, Bumstead.

               Strange business.  I...

AAAAAAAHHHHHHHH

!

     He screams horribly.  Stands, clutching his head.  Startled,

     Bumstead falls backwards off his chair.  Thompson, still

     clutching his head, runs and starts POUNDING HIS FACE against

     the wall.

                         THOMPSON

               Get away!  Leave me alone!

     Thompson's head is CHANGING  -  bloating.  It rapidly elongates

     into a pink fleshy tube.

     Thompson's head continues to grow -  his features are lost

     beneath folds of skin.  His screaming is stifled.  Thompson

     falls to the floor.  His head HUGE NOW  -  larger than his

     body.  Small tendrils sprout from the main appendage.

     Bumstead takes cover behind a sofa.

     Then, as violently as the head began to transform, it stops.

     Bumstead peaks over the sofa at the huge throbbing purple

     growth sprouting from Thompson's collar.  At the top of the

     growth an orifice opens.

     An EXPLOSION of green bile spouts into the room  -  covers

     everything in sight...

     Then the head starts to shrink.  Thompson's features appear

     again. It returns to normal size.  Thompson groans, sprawled on

     the floor, clutching his head.

     Bumstead looks on in horror.

                         THOMPSON

               It's  -  it's disgusting, I know...

     Thompson's face is heavily bruised, covered in sweat.  His nose

     starts to bleed  -  he wipes it on his sleeve.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Jesus!  We have to get you to a

               doctor...

                         THOMPSON

               No...  No doctor...

     Bumstead stands unsteadily.

                         BUMSTEAD

               But...  How long has this been

               happening?

                         THOMPSON

               A few days...  a few weeks  -  dunno,

               I can't remember.

                    (stands slowly)

               Worse thing is, I never know if it

               will change back again...  Now,

               please leave me alone.

     INT.  APARTMENT  -  NIGHT

     WHITE, ELIZABETH and SACHIKO sit around a small table, eating

     quietly.

     Without warning, Elizabeth starts to cry again.  White tries to

     ignore her. Sachiko looks sadly at the wife, puts a hand on her

     shoulder, gives her a handkerchief.  The woman quietens down.

     They resume eating but in no time Elizabeth again bursts into

     tears.  White looks at her now.

                         ELIZABETH  (through sobs)

               Sorry...

     Sachiko leans across and puts her arm around Elizabeth, helps

     her to her feet.  Elizabeth hangs onto the woman as she is led

     from the room.  White can hear the sobbing still, as the women

     move through to the bedroom.

     INT.  BEDROOM

     They sit on the edge of the bed  -  Sachiko holds Elizabeth's

     hand, smiles at her.

                         ELIZABETH (calmer now)

               I'm sorry...  This is embarrassing  -

               my husband doesn't know who I am...

     With this, she starts to cry again.

     Sachiko leans forward and tenderly kisses Elizabeth's lips.

     INT.  DARK CHAMBER  -  NIGHT

     TIGHT ON TWO MYSTERY MEN speaking in whispers.  The Men

     continue talking as THE CAMERA RISES, through several levels of

     concrete and machinery TO REVEAL:

     EXT.  ROOF-TOP  -  NIGHT

     OTHER MYSTERY MEN are rigging a wire to some kind of antenna

     device.

     BACK DOWN IN THE DARK CHAMBER

     The group of MYSTERY MEN have gathered once again.  One

     addresses them all.

                         MYSTERY MAN

               The line of junction between two

               edges!

                         MEN  (unison)

               YES!

                         MYSTERY MAN

               We have located him.  Now is the

               time, yes.

     A switch is thrown.  Electricity sparks to life.  A hum is in

     the air.

                         MYSTERY MAN

               Let the tuning commence!

     The congregation of MEN place ELECTRODES to their foreheads in

     a trance-like manner.  They chant, quietly at first, steadily

     building in volume.  The MEN stand and MOVE RHYTHMICALLY to

     some inner beat.

     The CAMERA MOVES ACROSS to a diagram pinned on a board.  A

     representation of a man's legs.  Trousers rolled up above the

     knees, showing a number of bite-like wounds on the flesh.

     Labels point out various parts of the legs in medical fashion

     -  the legends are an unknown language.

     ON THE ROOF

     The antenna glows with a ghostly green light.  O.S. SCREAMS

     RISE UP FROM THE STREET.

     INT.  APARTMENT/KITCHEN  -  LATER

     White downs a cup of black coffee, staring blankly out the

     window.  O.S. distant screams.

     He glances across to a wall, notices A FLY there  -  something

     about it looks WRONG.

     FLY'S P.O.V.

     A distorted electronic image of White's FACE looming up.

     At exactly that moment the FLY TAKES OFF, flies erratically

     down the hall, around a turn and disappears.  White follows.

     HALL-WAY

     White moves quietly towards the bedroom door.

     HIS P.O.V.

     It is ajar, dark inside.  Movement.  The women are naked on the

     bed.  The JAPANESE WOMAN has her eyes shut, head back in

     ecstasy. The WIFE is bent over her, kissing her stomach.

     ANGLE ON WHITE  -  watching through the crack in the door.  The

     women are oblivious.

     He moves away slowly, feeling strange.  His feet stop making

     contact with the floor.  He grabs a table to steady himself.

     The table-cloth comes away, things spill to the floor and

     smash. He's FLOATING.

     White desperately reaches out to grab something, holds the

     light-fixture in the ceiling.  It breaks off in a cloud of

     plaster.  Sparks briefly illuminate.  He falls heavily ONTO THE

     CEILING  -  now the floor.  The apartment is upside down.

     He stares up at furniture and objects.

     THE BATHROOM

     White steps into the room, eerily illuminated by a glowing

     heater stuck to the floor.  Water is running  -  filling the

     tub and overflowing, making a suspended puddle above White's

     head.

     White takes off his clothes and climbs the wall, towards the

     floor.  It's difficult, but he reaches the tap, turns it off.

     Pulls himself towards the tub.

     Gravity becomes NORMAL AGAIN as he sinks in the warm water.

     He's incredibly weak  -  floats limply in the bath.  Submerges

     his face.  A distant throbbing O.S., like a huge machine heart

     somewhere in the building.

     He opens his eyes, still underwater, stares up at the ceiling.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A blurry DARK FIGURE moves into his vision.  It stares down at

     him.

     White rigid with fright, cannot focus on the figure through the

     thin veil of water.  The FIGURE reaches out.  A GLOVED HAND

     grabs White about the throat, holds him forcefully.  White

     gulps for air, swallows water.  His eyes widen.  He tries to

     stop the hand strangling him but can't.

     Suddenly the hand pulls away.  The BLURRY FIGURE stumbles back

     and ERUPTS into bloody explosion.  The body splits apart,

     throwing internal organs through the room.

     White awakens in the bathtub.  He looks about the room.  Empty.

     Silent.  He gets out of the water, starts to dress.

     EXT.  BUILDING

     BUMSTEAD'S car pulls up.  He gets out, stained here and there

     with bile.

     INT.  APARTMENT

     A HIGH ANGLE on the slain bodies of the JAPANESE WOMAN and

     WHITE'S WIFE.  TWO COPS wander about the dark room, doing

     stuff.  Bumstead walks up to the cop in charge.

                         COP

               All the same entry wounds.  It's

               definitely him.

                    (indicates Sachiko's

                    corpse)

               She lives...  lived here.  A

               prostitute.

                         BUMSTEAD

               The other one?

                         COP

               His wife.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Jesus.  Small world.

                    (looks around)

               Where's the photographer?

                         COP

               No one available.

     A third YOUNG COP steps up to the cop in charge, glancing at

     the bile on Bumstead's suit.

                         YOUNG COP

               They won't come out.

                         COP

               We'll interrogate them anyway.

     The cop leads Bumstead behind a WOODEN PARTITION.  A small area

     neatly arranged  -  a double bed, various possessions.  Someone

     obviously lives here.  The room is empty however.

                         COP

               This is the family of the victim  -

               apparently they were in the apartment

               when he committed...

                         BUMSTEAD  (looks around empty room)

               What are you talking about?

                         COP

               Oh, yes...

     He walks to THE BED, bends over and lifts the bed-spread.  In

     the shadows underneath, Bumstead can make out SEVERAL FACES.  A

     man, an old woman, three or four children.

                         COP

               They don't speak English...

                         BUMSTEAD

               How will we interrogate them?

                         COP

               Well, sir...  I don't know exactly.

     Under the bed, Bumstead can see a LITTLE GIRL.  He walks over

     to her.  She puts a hand over her mouth, edges away.

                         BUMSTEAD

               It's alright.  I won't hurt you.

     Without coming out from under the bed she hands the inspector a

     crumpled paper.  He looks at it then glances over his shoulder.

     HIS P.O.V.

     The wooden room divider.  The CAMERA MOVES IN steadily, into a

     crack running along the length of the divider  -  we can see

     the room on the other side, with the cops moving about.

     Bumstead looks back at the page he holds in his hands.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A child-like DRAWING.  Two men, stick figures, dressed in

     black, with impossibly big knifes, slash at two screaming

     women.

     Unmistakable  -  MYSTERY MEN.

     INT.  DARK CHAMBER  -  NIGHT

     DOCTOR SCHREBER walks stiffly into the room and sits at the

     head of a boardroom table.  He's cold, pulls his coat up about

     his neck.  The long table is lined on both sides with immobile

     MYSTERY MEN.

     A DARK FIGURE walks into the room, steps up to the other end of

     the table.  This is the enigmatic MISTER BLACK  -  only ever

     seen hidden in shadow.

                         MISTER BLACK  (addressing Men)

               Gentlemen.

                    (peers at Schreber)

               Doctor.

     He sits, dark and mysterious.

                         MISTER BLACK

               I have called this meeting for a

               purpose, yes?

                    (turns to Schreber)

               It is clear to you we are  -

               unhappy, yes?

                         SCHREBER

               Yes, of course.  I...

                         MISTER BLACK

               The tuning failed  -  when our agents

               arrived he was gone.  He 

knows

 things

               -  predicts things.  Explain to us,

               Doctor.  Why is the situation this

               way?  Yes?

     Schreber seems distinctly uncomfortable.

                         SCHREBER

               I'm not certain I fully understand

               myself...

                         MISTER BLACK

               No excuses, dearest Doctor!  Answers.

               Yes?

                         MYSTERY MEN  (chant in unison)

               Answers!  Answers!

                         MISTER BLACK

               You said this would be containable!

               Nothing works this time.  Why is this

               so?

                         MYSTERY MEN

               Why!  Why!

                         SCHREBER

               I  -  ah  -  I...  it's a little cold

               in here don't you think?

                         MISTER BLACK

               We must find him.  This is your

               responsibility.

                         SCHREBER (thinking fast)

               Yes, of course...

     INT.  INSPECTOR'S OFFICE

     Bumstead once again scratches his head in front of a map.  The

     little girl's drawing is pinned to his board.  His attention

     wanders.  He notices a FLY CRAWLING across the wall in front of

     his face.  He leans closer, studying it.

     The intercom crackles to life.  The insect flies off.

                         MISS CRENSHAW  (through intercom)

               A call, sir.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Who is it?

                         MISS CRENSHAW

               Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Put it through...

     A light flashes.  Bumstead picks up.

                         BUMSTEAD

               This is Bumstead.  Who is this?

     He listens intently.

     INT.  BUMSTEAD'S OFFICE

     BUMSTEAD enters.  He looks nervous.  His SECRETARY sits at her

     desk in an adjoining office, filing her nails.

                         BUMSTEAD

               I need everything on the Jonathan

               White case.

                         MISS CRENSHAW

               Yes, sir.  

Everything

?

                         BUMSTEAD

               All the important stuff.  Wrap it up

               for me.

     The inspector turns to face her, a little manic. She is staring

     at him.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Please  -  I'm in a hurry.

                         MISS CRENSHAW (evenly)

               Certainly.

     EXT.  POLICE STATION

     BUMSTEAD steps from the doorway and walks across to his car

     briskly.

     INT.  BATH-HOUSE

     Bumstead moves down a long corridor full of people in towels

     and swimming outfits, waiting silently.  They sit lined by a

     wall, staring into space.

     Bumstead walks into a larger tiled room, full of steam.  He

     walks beside a heated pool  -  naked people swim about weakly

     or sit on the edge washing themselves.  He steps up to A FULLY

     DRESSED MAN, sitting silently on a bench.  It is WHITE.

     A feint smile brushes across White's lips as he looks up at the

     inspector.  He looks away, like he's forgotten something.

     Stands, walks over to the pool, cups his hand, bends down,

     scoops some water.

     Bumstead sees White has picked up the LITTLE SILVER FISH.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Why give yourself up?

                         WHITE

               I  -  ah - couldn't think of

               anything else to do.  I thought maybe

               you know something...

                    (beat)

               I'm scared.

                         BUMSTEAD

               That was a pretty good escape act at

               the station.  How did you do that?

                         WHITE

               I woke up in a subway.  I don't know

               how I got there.

                         BUMSTEAD  (not convinced)

               Uh-huh.

                    (pauses)

               What are you scared of?

                         WHITE

               People...  after me.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Who?

                         WHITE

               I don't know who they are.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Why are they after you?

                         WHITE

               Don't know that either.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Don't know much, do you?

     INT.  LABORATORY  -  NIGHT

     Metal scraping.

     PIANO ACCORDION MUSIC wafts on a breeze, someone breathing.

     HIGH ANGLE  -  Down through an OPENING metal hatch.  A dim

     laboratory IS REVEALED  -  a maze of scientific instruments.

     Elongated shadows move about.

     MYSTERY MEN are hunched over something.  Behind them a

     diagrammatic chart of the evolution of the human brain.

     MAN 1 bends across to a CONTROL PANEL, works a switch.  A small

     speaker in a metal box crackles to life.  SOUND OF DISTANT

     SURF.  A WOMAN'S VOICE:

                         VOICE

               What is your name...  What is your

               name...

     Wires lead from the metal box to a HUMAN BRAIN within a

     metallic container.  Electricity arches across electrodes.

     More sounds from the speaker:  WATER BUBBLING.  HIGH HEELS WALK

     DOWN STAIRS.  BED-SPRINGS.  LOVERS MOAN PASSIONATELY.

     MAN 2 steps forward and pulls a bloodied sheet from their

     handiwork.

     A PUPPET-LIKE CREATURE is revealed.  Small  -  two and half

     feet tall.  The top of its head an open hatch containing the

     BRAIN.  Wires lead to this.

     TIGHT ON PUPPET'S EYES  -  They glance about the room. Its body

     is a series of geometric shapes and polished surfaces.

     MAN 1 shines a torch into the puppet's eyes.

     INSIDE ITS HEAD

     Gears turn, illuminated by the beam of the light.  The gears

     part slowly to reveal a small writhing INSECT screwed to a

     metal plate.

     MAN 2 shows the puppet PHOTOGRAPHS:  WHITE as he looks

     currently, shots of him as a teenager, a young boy, a baby.

     Photos of what we realise are his parents, standing on a

     seaside pier sirtiling and waving.  Where he went to school.  A

     red push-bike he owned as a boy.  His first sweetheart.  Then a

     photo of a young woman smiling  -  his WIFE.

     MAN 3 holds up a small sea shell to the mechanical ear of the

     puppet creature  -  MORE SOUNDS OF SURF...

     A FIGURE clutching a wooden cane looks on from the shadows.

     His pale hand fondles the ornate handle of his cane  -  a

     carved silver insect.  It's MISTER BLACK.  Man 3 steps up to

     him.

                         MISTER BLACK

               You have duplicated the personality,

               yes.

                         MAN 3

               It is ready.  The Doctor was most

               helpful.

     Mister Black turns towards the OTHER MEN.

                         MISTER BLACK

               I hear a clock in my head, and I like

               it!

                         MEN  (respond in unison)

               We hear clocks in our heads, and we

               like it!

                         MISTER BLACK

               A world in our likeness!

                         MEN

               A world in our likeness!

     The Men close the hatch in the top of the puppet's head.

     SQUEAK...  CLUNK!  The puppet tests out its MANY WEAPONS, a

     series of nasty-looking blades snap out of its small body, then

     retract.

     INT.  INSPECTOR'S APARTMENT

     Bumstead leads White through the front door, into a SITTING

     ROOM.  Everything is extremely neat and organized, plastic

     coverings on all the furniture.  White steps towards a sofa.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Please.  Not that way.  If you could

               just follow the covering  -  the

               carpet gets stained and it's

               impossible to clean.

     White stops. Bumstead indicates a CLEAR PLASTIC MAT running

     through the room.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Everything the department knows about

               John White is in this.  Here.

                    (hands file)

               Excuse me for a moment.

     White flips through it.  Details of White's history.

     IN THE BEDROOM

     Bumstead removes an empty suitcase from a closet.  Begins to

     place neatly folded clothes within it.

                         BUMSTEAD (calling to White)

               Age thirty one.  Brown hair.  Green

               eyes.  Five feet, ten and a half

               inches tall.  Until recently worked

               for a firm manufacturing scientific

               equipment.  Wife's name  -  Elizabeth.

               Father and mother  -  Harold and

               Edith.  Both dead.  A history of

               mental instability...  etcetera,

               etcetera.

     Bumstead walks back into the sitting room, packed bag in hand.

     He looks at White leafing through the file.

                         BUMSTEAD

               That stuff helpful?

                         WHITE  (disappointed)

               I suppose...

                    (looks up)

               Why are you helping me?

                         BUMSTEAD

               You're case has been driving me

               crazy.  You see, I pride myself on

               being thorough.  There's too many

               loose ends with your case.

                    (a beat)

               Thought it was best you were hidden

               until we understand more about the

               facts.  What do you know about these

               men in black?

     White looks up, pauses as if he didn't understand Bumstead,

     then:

                         WHITE

               If you shoot them here...

                    (points at his

                    forehead)

               you can kill them.  They're not

               people  -  like us  -  got insects in

               their heads...  Got any disinfectant?

     The inspector is caught off-guard by the question.

                         WHITE  (continues)

               It's my legs.  Been bitten.  Giving

               me trouble.

     Bumstead walks silently to the bathroom, opens a medicine

     cabinet.

                         BUMSTEAD  (to himself)

               Insects?

     He returns clutching a small bottle and some cotton wool.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Here.

                    (hands things to

                    White)

               Careful with your trousers.  That

               stuff stains.

     The inspector gives white back his revolver and his wallet.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Here.

     Bumstead paces thoughtfully, careful to stay on the plastic

     protective covering.  He turns, glares at White, who dabs his

     legs with the cotton wool.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Any idea what part the Doctor plays

               in this business?

     White shakes head.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Let's try and find out, shall we.

                    (points at White's

                    shoe)

               Lace is untied.

     White looks down.  Bumstead doesn't lie.

     INT.  DRUG STORE  -  NIGHT

     The BARBER is shaving under the armpit of a client.  GRANDPA

     snores in a corner, his feet buried under a pile of hair

     clippings..

     The BELL hanging above the door rings.  The door swings open.

                         BARBER

               He with you shortly, sir...

     Several heads turn, THEN LOOK DOWN to see the PUPPET.  The

     puppet wheels forward and stops.

                         BARBER (not really looking)

               Hello, sonny.  Cute outfit.  Mother

               get it for you?

     The puppet crosses the room threateningly.  TWO OTHER CLIENTS

     look up startled from their newspapers and girly magazines.

     ON THE PUPPET  -  it wheels up to the barber's leg and GRABS HIS

     TROUSER with a mechanical claw.  The puppet holds out a PHOTO

     OF White.

                         PUPPET (incoherent obscenities)

               EEEEEEEEK...  AHHHHHHH!...

               SHHHHIIIITTTT!...  FUUUUCKER!!

                         BARBER (looks down, scared now)

               Huh?

     He's grabbed and THROWN into a nearby chair.  The puppet leaps

     onto the bench in front of him  -  he's frightened, so are the

     customers.

     Puppet wheels up and down on the bench in front of the

     customers  -  stopping to glance at individuals in a threatening

     manner, holding out the photo of white.

     It leans forward, spinning its blades  -  HAIR FLIES.  Screams

     o.s.

     The PUPPET retracts its weapons  -  COVERED in blood.  It

     wheels forward, through the door and into the street.

     THE CAMERA PANS to reveal a scene of complete carnage.  Blood

     covers the walls.  FOUR BODIES slumped about the room.  Each has

     an outlandish hairstyle.

     INT.  BUMSTEAD'S CAR

     White looks at the inspector  -  street lights pass over his

     features.  Bumstead stares at the road.

                         BUMSTEAD

               I didn't tell you the entire reason I

               helped you.  It started with two

               little girls.  Twins.  Used to play

               with them when I was young.  Couldn't

               remember for the life of me what they

               looked like, then I understood why...

     He looks at the dashboard, brushes away a small piece of lint.

                         BUMSTEAD

               They didn't have faces.

                         WHITE

               What?

                         BUMSTEAD

               That's right.  Just seamless flesh

               across the front of their heads.  No

               mistake.  I just hadn't remembered it

               that way.  Up until then they had

               been normal little girls in my

               memory.

                    (looks back at White)

               That's not all.  Once I started

               examining them, all sorts of things

               about my life, had...

               inconsistencies.  It was like a game.

               I would think about a person or a

               place, or an event.  Then I would

               turn the lights off.  Sit down in a

               comfortable chair...  And study each

               detail of this subject.

     He glances at White, then back to the road.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Everything was liquid beneath a thin

               surface that had always seemed solid

               to me...

     Bumstead and White are quiet momentarily, then:

                         BUMSTEAD

               Is there anything you haven't told me

               about this business?  Even the most

               insignificant thing?

                         WHITE (thinking)

               No.  Nothing I can think of.

               Except...

                         BUMSTEAD

               Go on.

                         WHITE

               Well.  The only thing I've been

               certain of, all this time, is that I

               need to get to the ocean.  The point

               is no one seems to know how to get

               there.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Why, that's ridiculous.  You just...

     He trails off.  Shakes his head slowly.

                         BUMSTEAD

               We'll get to the bottom of this.  I

               mean it.

     INT.  SCHREBER'S SURGERY

     The doctor is sitting at his desk, when the door bursts open

     suddenly.  White and Bumstead move into the room and grab the

     doctor before he can protest.

                         BUMSTEAD

               I met a friend of yours the other

               night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No

               hair.  Rather pale skin...

                         SCHREBER

               I don't know what you're talking

               about.

                         BUMSTEAD

               That's surprising.  He was leaving

               your office at the time...

                         SCHREBER

               You are mistaken.

                         WHITE

               What are you hiding?

                         SCHREBER

               Nothing.  I don't know anything!

     BUMSTEAD removes his revolver, sticks it in the doctor's face.

                         SCHREBER

               Please, they'll kill me...

                         BUMSTEAD

               I think it's time you introduced us

               to your little friends.

     EXT.  ALLEY  -  NIGHT

     SCHREBER, BUMSTEAD AND WHITE sit in Bumstead's car in an

     alleyway.

     Schreber points to a SOLITARY METAL DOOR in a wall.

                         SCHREBER

               In there.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Just like that?

     The threesome step from the car, keep close to a wall.

     Schreber alone steps up to the door, leans down to a mat at the

     foot of the door, lifts it and takes a KEY from underneath.  He

     unlocks the door, opens it, puts the key back, goes inside.  He

     waves the other men forward.

     White and Bumstead step up to the door  -  Bumstead looks at the

     mat  -  it says:  WELCOME on it.

     A CORRIDOR

     Through the door  -  AN ELEVATOR.  There is only a down button.

     Schreber presses it, several seconds later the doors open.

     They step inside.  The doors close, the lift descends.

                         BUMSTEAD

               What is this place?

                         SCHREBER

               You wouldn't believe me if I told

               you, Inspector.  Have patience  -

               you'll see for yourself.

     When the doors open again the three men look out on a DARK

     PASSAGEWAY.

     EXT.  LIBRARY  -  NIGHT

     The PUPPET wheels up to the sweeping set of stairs at the base

     of the building.  It stops, WHEELS BUMP into the steps

     repeatedly.  It looks down and shrieks with a string of

     mechanical obscenities.

     INT.  MYSTERY MEN'S UNDERWORLD

     WHITE and BUMSTEAD follow SCHREBER down a corridor to what

     appears to be an ancient crypt.  They enter a door  -  it has

     something written on it in a strange language.

     INSIDE IS A ROOM

     They stumble around in the darkness, Schreber finds a light

     switch, suddenly White STOPS dead in his tracks  -  Bumstead

     turns to him.

                         WHITE

               Look.

     White points to a wall featuring a line of brass hooks.  On

     these hooks hang MYSTERY MEN coats -  that's not all.  Each hook

     carries A FACE.

     Bumstead and White step closer, look at the faces.  They seem to

     be elaborate, very life-like MASKS.

                         SCHREBER

               Put them on.

     White and the inspector look at each other, incredulous.

     OUTSIDE  -  THE CORRIDOR

     The door opens.  White, Bumstead and Schreber step out, wearing

     poorly fitting masks and coats  -  DISGUISED AS MYSTERY MEN.

     FURTHER ALONG THE CORRIDOR

     The three men come across a small area with a raised platform,

     between arches.  A number of OPEN CARTS roll past on tracks  -

     the scene resembles some bizarre amusement-park ride.  The carts

     are numbered on the side  -  all of them empty.

                         SCHREBER

               Get in.  Hurry.

     White, Bumstead and Schreber hop aboard.  The cart takes them

     into a DARK TUNNEL, deeper into the secret underworld of the

     MYSTERY MEN.  They MOVE THROUGH a subterranean landscape of

     unexplained contraptions and bones.

                         WHITE

                    (to Bumstead)

               Where do you think this goes?

                         BUMSTEAD

               It sure isn't the fun-fair.

     The cart finally comes to a stop in a cave.  Bumstead, White and

     Schreber leap out and hide in a dark doorway, as a LONG LINE OF

     MYSTERY MEN walk past them.

                         SCHREBER

               Follow me, and do exactly as I do.

     They join the end of the line, falling into step.

     INT.  DARK CHAMBER

     The MEN, with WHITE, BUMSTEAD and SCHREBER in tow, enter and

     sit in a number of rows of wooden chairs.  White and the

     inspector do the same.

     MORE MYSTERY MEN appear in circular portals high up on the

     concrete walls.  ONE MAN faces the others at the front of the

     room.

                         MYSTERY MAN 1

               Eleven past eleven  -  the Night of the

               Eye.

     The seated Men start to CHANT.

                         MEN

               NIGHT OF THE EYE!  NIGHT OF THE EYE!

     A MAN in the front row stands.

                         MAN 2

               The Eye is too small for the head of

               the pin!

                         MAN 1

               Yes!

     ANOTHER MAN stands.  Next to the first, who sits again.

                         MAN 3

               What is it that floats on the water?

               The Eye!

                         MAN 1

               Indeed!

     So it goes around the room, each Man takes his turn announcing

     part of the strange ritual.  It will be White, Bumstead and

     Schreber's turn shortly.  White is worried, looks at the

     others.

                         WHITE (whisper)

               What do we do?

                         SCHREBER (hisses back)

               Fake it!

                         BUMSTEAD

               What?

     SCHREBER is next  -  he stands abruptly.

                         SCHREBER

               The eye.  Master of time and space!

     Then it's Bumstead's turn.

                         BUMSTEAD

               The Eye  -  um  -  delicious with

               horseradish on rye!

     MAN 1 at the front seems confused for a moment  -  SEVERAL of

     the others turn towards Bumstead.

                         MAN 1 (uncertain)

               Good.

     The inspector sits back down  -  whispers to White without

     looking at him.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Nothing to it...

     White stands.  Hesitates.  Then:

                         WHITE

               Eye...  eye, captain!

     White sits down, shaking his head, embarrassed.

                         MAN 1

               Um  -  yes...

     THE MAN NEXT TO WHITE rises up  -  keeps rising, FLOATS IN THE

     AIR above the Men's heads.

                         MAN 4

               My spine will bend for the Eye!

     He turns sideways, still floating.

     EXT.  ALLEY

     BACK ABOVE GROUND, Bumstead, White and Schreber run from the

     door at the end of the alley-way, tossing their masks away.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Was that for real down there?

                         SCHREBER

               I'm afraid so.

     The inspector stops walking suddenly, grabs White, holds him

     back.

                         BUMSTEAD

               What the 

hell

 is that?

     At the end of the alley the PUPPET advances menacingly.

     Schreber takes his chance and runs down an alley and

     disappears.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Quick.  My car.

     Fortunately BUMSTEAD'S CAR stands nearby.  The two men leap in,

     start it up.  Bumstead guns towards the puppet standing in the

     glare of the headlights.

     The puppet's head opens, a TINY PROPELLER pops out, spins,

     lifting the puppet into the air.  The car passes beneath it at

     speed.  Screeches off into a street, races along between tall

     buildings.

     INSIDE THE CAR

                         WHITE

               What now?

                         BUMSTEAD

               This ocean business...  I know where

               I can find a map.  I need to go back

               to the station.  Where will you be?

     White thinks for a moment, pulls the paper his wife gave him

     from his pocket.

                         WHITE

               I'll go see an uncle of mine.

                    (reading)

               Five  -  one  -  eight  -  three  -  double

               six  -  three...

     Bumstead scribbles on the pad mounted to the dash, battles with

     the wheel, driving at breakneck speed.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Good.

                    (looks in rear

                    mirror)

               Uh-oh...

     White turns and looks behind them.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  HEADLIGHTS gaining on them.

     ON THE PUPPET  -  sitting AT THE WHEEL of a stolen car, driving

     like crazy.

     BACK IN BUMSTEAD'S CAR

     White takes out his gun  -  AIMS at the rapidly approaching

     car.

                         WHITE  (remembers)

               It's empty.

                         BUMSTEAD

               Take mine.

     Bumstead pulls a gun out of his coat.  They swap.

     The puppet PULLS ALONGSIDE, a mechanical arm extends towards

     Bumstead's front tire.  A SPINNING BLADE extends from the end

     of the mechanical arm.

                         PUPPET

               ARRRRRRRRGGGHHHH!...  HA-HA-HA-HA-

               HA!!

     TIGHT ON THE BLADE heading for the spinning wheel.  White

     fires.  Shells hit the PUPPET'S car, shattering windows.

     THE BLADE cuts into the tire  -  it pops loudly, goes flat,

     metal SPARKS off the road.

     White is thrown forward, hits his head on the dash.  Bumstead

     fights to keep control, SWERVES into the side of the other

     vehicle, making it scrape a concrete wall, hits garbage cans

     flying.

     The PUPPET'S car falls behind  -  then swerves off into a side-

     street and disappears.

                         BUMSTEAD  (looks behind him)

               Where did it go?

                         WHITE  (looks back also)

               Don't know.

     Both look FORWARD AGAIN  -  to see the PUPPET'S CAR pull out in

     front of them, BLOCKING THE WAY.  Bumstead's car is going too

     fast.  Slams the brakes.

     TIGHT ON PUPPET  -  Screaming with insane joy as Bumstead's car

     approaches like a bullet.

     INSIDE INSPECTOR'S CAR

                         BUMSTEAD

               Jump!

     Bumstead rips the phone number from the pad.  The two men LEAP.

     The car continues onwards.

     CRASH!  KA-BOOM!

     In the glow of the flaming wrecks, the two men pick themselves

     up from different sides of the street.  Look at each other,

     turn and head in OPPOSITE directions.

     CAMERA MOVES IN on mangled metal  -  a MECHANICAL CLAW starts

     to pull itself from the wreckage.

     EXT.  STREET  -  NIGHT

     White steps up to a SMALL DOOR in the side of a building.  A

     sign above the door depicts an underwater scene, crammed with

     fish, sea-weed, bubbles floating to the surface.  Dominating

     everything is a GREEN MAN with scales  -  a KING NEPTUNE-type.

     INSIDE

     White stops in front of a ticket booth, beside a faded blue

     curtain.  In the booth a TICKET SELLER is snoring with his mouth

     hanging open, his head sagging. White knocks on the window.  The

     man wakes with a start.

                         TICKET SELLER

               Yeah.  That's what I said!

                    (looks at White  -

                    rubs head)

               What..?

                         WHITE

               I'm looking for this address.

     The man squints at the card White holds up, nods groggily.

                         TICKET SELLER

               Upstairs.  Through there.

     He thumbs the blue curtain.  Curls up, shuts his eyes again.

     BEYOND THE CURTAIN

     A dark room full of BUBBLING NOISES AND WATER DRIPPING  -  an

     aquarium.

     Several corridors meander between large glass panels that look

     into illuminated tanks of sea creatures.

     White moves past a shadowy doorway.  He can barely make out

     STAIRS.

     INT.  HALL-WAY

     White moves cautiously in the darkness.  On a door a tiny

     NAMEPLATE says:  K. WHITE.  The door is unlocked.  He opens it

     and goes in.

     INSIDE

     An entrance hall of an apartment.  A large number of MOUNTED

     FISH of all sizes line the hall.

     PHOTOS on the wall  -  family portraits.  White examines these,

     concentrates on one in particular  -  a young boy on a red push-

     bike, in the background a sign with a faded image of a girl in

     a bathing suit:  WELCOME TO BLUMBVILLE!  it says.

     A strange WHIRRING NOISE O.S.  White hides behind a sofa.

     Whatever is making the whirring noise moves past slowly.  White

     cannot see what it is.

                         VOICE O.S.

               John?

     White turns to see an OLD MAN in his pyjamas sitting in a

     WHEELCHAIR.  The man pushes a lever on the side of the chair.  A

     whir of electric motors.  The chair carries him out of the

     shadows.  White steps from behind the sofa.

                         MAN

               Are you alright?  What are you doing

               here?  Is this one of your jokes,

               John?  It's been so long, I thought

               you'd forgotten your uncle Karl?

                         WHITE

               Uncle...  Karl.

     INT.  AIR-CONDITION DUCT

     A P.O.V.  -  MOVING THROUGH a dark, claustrophobic pipe.

     TWISTING around tight corners, DARTING down straight lengths of

     ducting.  Dim light spills from wire grills spaced along the

     walls.

     WE TRAVEL up to one grill, at the end of a long stretch of

     tunnel  -  stop, nowhere left to go. We can see through the gaps

     in the wire, looking down into...

     THE ROOM

     White and uncle Karl are having a SLIDE-SHOW.  Shots of a recent

     vacation  -  the uncle doing a series of mundane things.

                         KARL (chuckling)

               Not often I get a chance to show

               these.

     He changes the slide:  an image of him standing against a brick

     wall.

                         KARL

               And this is me again about  -  um  -  I

               would guess about twelve feet further

               to the right of the last shot.  Now

               just behind the wall is the hotel I

               stayed at  -  sweet little place...

     The PHONE RINGS.  Uncle Karl wheels over, picks up the receiver.

                         KARL (talks down the line)

               Hello...  Yes, he's here...

                    (holds out the phone

                    to White)

               It's for you.

     White concerned  -  takes the phone.

                         WHITE

               Yes?

                    (he listens)

               Oh, it's you...  Yes...  My uncle

               apparently...  Just looking at some

               memories...  You have?  That's good.

                                              CUT TO:

     INT.  POLICE STATION  -  NIGHT

     Bumstead talks to White on the phone.  He stands in a dark

     room, surrounded by charts and maps.

                         BUMSTEAD

               At first I thought there was no way

               to get to the ocean...  The buildings

               are a barrier, no windows, no doors

               -  everything just, well, ends  -  only

               thing would be drill a hole.  But

               then, I saw it, one door, just one...

               Inside a tenement building...

     Bumstead is interrupted by a NOISE O.S.  He looks to a frosted

     partition  -  dark figures walk past on the other side.  He

     quickly sorts through SEVERAL MAPS, making as little noise as

     he can.

                         BUMSTEAD (whisper)

               We can meet later  -  but first I

               have to do something.  Look I got to

               go...

                                              CUT BACK TO:

     White holds THE PHONE, listens to Bumstead on the other end.

                         WHITE

               Where can we meet?...  Alright.

               Good...

     As White hangs up he notices A DOOR behind a big old crockery

     cupboard.  The cupboard has been pushed up against the wall,

     hiding the door.

     BACK IN THE POLICE STATION

     BUMSTEAD quickly folds the map and shoves it into his pocket.

     As he turns and runs from the room we NOTICE A DARK FIGURE

     standing behind a shelf in the room.

     IN UNCLE KARL'S APARTMENT

     UNCLE KARL continues to change slides  -  the noise echoing

     about the room.  White moves over and sits down next to him.

                         KARL

               Look!  This is a good one!

                         WHITE

               What is that door?

                         KARL

               Which one?

                         WHITE

               There.  Behind the cabinet.  Where

               does it go?

     The uncle watches the slides.

                         KARL

               Such a joker!  Like your father.

                         WHITE

               No.  Have a look.

     He leads the old man over to the cabinet.

                         WHITE

               You see it?

                         KARL

               Yes.

                         WHITE

               Where does it lead?

                         KARL

               It must be a closet or something.

     White pushes at the cabinet.  The old man helps.  They only

     manage to push several inches  -  it is very heavy.  White

     decides to just climb over it.  He squeezes through, opens the

     door and climbs a set of dark stairs.  Uncle Karl watches.

                         KARL

               Don't trip over.  It's dark up there.

     INT.  ATTIC  -  NIGHT

     TIGHT ON a light switch  -  it is flipped.

     AN ATTIC  -  full of books, boxes, discarded possessions.

     White picks up a book and opens it  -  the pages have been

     eaten out by a swarm of ROACHES.  He drops it in disgust as the

     insects scurry over his hands.

     In a small wooden box are several toys he examines with great

     interest.  At the bottom of the box he finds a SMALL DOG-EARED

     DRAWING BOOK.  On the cover is a colourful scrawl in child's

     writing  -  a title:  ANSWERS  -  BY JONATHAN WHITE, AGE NINE.

     White sits down and flips through the book in the dim light.

     Page after page is filled with neat handwriting and drawings.

     As he reads segments from the book he seems more and more

     disturbed.  He flips through faster and faster.

     HIS P.O.V.

     Pages flip past, stopping occasionally.  Glimpses of DIAGRAMS.

     The MYSTERY MEN and THEIR WORLD.  Cross-sections of the MYSTERY

     MEN, the cavity in their head with the INSECTS INSIDE clearly

     illustrated.  EVERYTHING.

     PUSH IN CLOSE on White.  He looks up, STUNNED.

     INT.  UNCLE KARL'S APARTMENT

     White emerges from the attic, clutching the small book to his

     chest, lost in thought.  He steps quietly into a hall-way  -

     notices the old man putting THE PHONE back on its cradle.

                         KARL

               John, I didn't see you there.

     A NOISE O.S. White and Uncle Karl turn.  A VENTILATION GRILL

     falls off a wall, revealing a hole.  EYES shine from the

     darkness.

     THE PUPPET leaps from the hole.  Its blades unfolding,

     spinning wildly before it hits the carpet.  It faces the two

     men.

                         KARL

               What is 

that

?

                         WHITE (to Karl)

               Get back!

                         KARL

               Filthy beast!  Shoo!  Go on!  Shoo!

     He wheels forward, attempting to scare the puppet off.

                         WHITE

               No!

     The puppet goes for Uncle Karl.  A whirr of metal, BLOOD

     SPLASHES ACROSS WHITE and the walls.  Uncle Karl SCREAMS

     horribly.

     White grabs a chair  -  holds it above him.  The puppet turns

     from the dead man in the wheelchair.  White lets it have it.

     The chair CRASHES DOWN, splintering into pieces.

     The puppet is dazed, but immediately recovers.  White has a

     fire-poker now.  As the puppet advances, he swings, connecting

     with the creature, hurtling it across the room, into a wall.

     White runs out the door.

     IN THE CORRIDOR

     He leaps into a waiting elevator.  Pushes the top floor button.

     THE ELEVATOR SHAFT  -  The elevator moves upwards.

     INSIDE THE ELEVATOR

     White looks through the circular window in the door.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  Floor after floor SLIDES PAST  -  deserted.  He

     looks at the floor indicator.  TIGHT ON NUMBERS lighting up:

     86, 87, 88...

     Then the elevator stops, the doors open, looking down a dark

     corridor.  The PUPPET is at the end.  It turns to face him,

     SUDDENLY RACES FORWARD, a horrible high-pitched shriek from its

     mechanical voice box.

     White STABS the buttons of the elevator frantically, the doors

     won't close.  The puppet is upon him.  He JUMPS, straight up.

     It goes under him, CRASHING INTO the back of the elevator.

     White hits the down button one last time, and leaps out of the

     compartment AS THE DOORS CLOSE.

     A MECHANICAL extendible arm shoots out and grabs White around

     the ankle. DRAGS him across floor.  THE PUPPET shrieks wildly

     again, as...

     ITS ARM  -  is JAMMED in the closing doors now.  Lift descends.

     The puppet squeals.  The arm SNAPS OFF.

     White stands, pulls dislocated arm off his ankle.  He can hear

     the elevator descending.  Suddenly it STOPS  -  starts

     returning to his floor.  White turns and runs again.

     The lift doors BURST OPEN  -  the ENRAGED CREATURE emerges and

     races after him.

     He tears around a corner  -  finds himself in a dead-end.

     Nowhere to go.  He can hear the puppet approaching along the

     corridor.  Suddenly he notice A GRILL on a wall ABOVE HIS HEAD.

     He pulls it off, climbs into an incredibly tight pipe.  Crawls

     frantically.

     He sees a LIGHT ahead.  An opening.  He kicks the grill off.  A

     sudden gust of wind.

     HIS P.O.V.

     The pipe leads to the outside of the building  -  nowhere to go

     except a hundred stories STRAIGHT DOWN.  He screams, almost

     falls.  Turns to start crawling back.

     Suddenly the end of the pipe fills with WHIRRING METAL BLADES.

     The puppet has followed him in and is advancing.

     No choice  -  he looks out the hole.  SEES A PIPE on the

     outside of the building, running vertically near the opening.

     It looks impossible but it's his only chance.

     He climbs out, balancing himself on the lip of the opening,

     REACHES for the pipe.  The puppet is almost upon him.  He

     swings across, gets a HAND on the pipe.  He slips, DANGLES  -

     holding on  -  one hand on the pipe, one on the edge of the hole.

     The pipe is greasy, slippery, can't grip it.

     SUDDENLY he hears a MECHANICAL CLICKING  -  TURNS to see the

     puppet standing on the edge of the hole, inches from his hand.

     A soft noise reverberates in its voice box  -  a mechanical

     giggle?  A circular blade on one of its arms starts up, moves

     down onto White's HAND.

     TIGHT ON HIS EYES  -  sweat beads and runs down his forehead.

     TIGHT ON THE BLADE  -  as it cuts into flesh.  BLOOD spatters

     White's face as he grimaces with intense pain.  He can't hold

     on.

     HE FALLS, plummets through space.  Screaming.

     INT.  HOSPITAL  -  NIGHT

     A GROUP OF SURGEONS stand about BUMSTEAD'S MOTHER on her life-

     support machinery.  The surgeons have face-masks on and are in

     deep shadow.  The woman stares blankly, still in a coma.

     IN THE RECEPTION AREA

     BUMSTEAD looks up from his wristwatch.

                         BUMSTEAD

               I can't wait any longer...

     He is standing in front of the MALE NURSE in the glassed-in

     counter.

                         NURSE

               I'm sorry.  I told you, she is being

               examined...

     He turns and storms off down the corridor.  The NURSE stands,

     shouting after him.

                         NURSE

               Mister Bumstead!

     INSIDE MOTHER'S ROOM

     One of the "doctors" leans down and grabs a handful of WIRES

     leading out of a box beside the woman.

                         SURGEON

               We will teach the pig to meddle in

               our affairs.  Yes.

     He pulls the wires out in a burst of electrical sparks  -  ALL

     THE MACHINES DIE.  The woman comes to life momentarily, starts

     to claw at the glass shield in front of her face, like she is

     suffocating.  The life drains from her weak body and she is

     STILL.

     ANGLE ON THE DOOR  -  it bursts open.  Bumstead is standing

     there.  The masked surgeons are startled, they turn rapidly to

     face him.

                         BUMSTEAD (steps forward)

               What is happening?

                         SURGEON

               Ah, Inspector Bumstead!  We are glad

               you are here  -  I'm afraid we have

               done all we can.  Yes.  Your Mother

               has passed.  Yes.

     Bumstead turns towards his mother.

                         BUMSTEAD

               But she was getting better...

                         SURGEON

               We are sorry.  The cancer  -  it was

               fatal.

     Bumstead turns to the men, confusion in his eyes.

                         BUMSTEAD

               She doesn't have cancer.

     The men glance at each other for a moment, then back at the

     inspector.

                         SURGEON

               We knew that.  Yes.

                    (the other men nod)

               Anyway  -  she is dead.

     Bumstead leaps forward, RIPS OFF one of the surgeon's masks.

     ANGLE ON THE MAN  -  He turns to look at Bumstead, pale skin,

     staring eyes, a MYSTERY MAN.  TWO OTHER MEN grab him from

     behind.

                         BUMSTEAD (struggles)

               I'll kill you all!

     One of the Mystery Men steps up to the struggling inspector,

     places the palm of his hand across Bumstead's eyes.

                         MYSTERY MAN

               You will obey us, yes.  In your mind

               there is a dark space...

     TIGHT ANGLE

     Bumstead's hand reaches out, fumbles at a tray of surgical

     implements, grabs a SCALPEL.

     WIDER

     He cuts into the hand of one of the Men holding him, SPINS AND

     DRIVES the scalpel into the forehead of the Mystery Man

     attempting to hypnotise him.

     The other Men leap towards him.

     EXT.  CANAL  -  NIGHT

     TIGHT ON WHITE'S FACE

     His eyes are shut tight.  He opens them, slowly LOOKS AROUND,

     curious why he isn't dead.

     WIDER ANGLE

     White floats in MID-AIR, hovering ten feet or so above a dark

     body of water.  He looks amazed.  Shuts his eyes, rubs them,

     opens them again.  Still floating.

     He clenches his fists and TENSES his body.  Slowly he starts to

     MOVE FORWARD, hovering at an even height over the water.

     WIDER STILL

     SEVERAL ANGLES feature the figure of White levitating across

     the harbour, past half-sunken buildings and rusted ships.

     TIGHT ON WHITE  -  He comes to a stop.  Smiles in amazement.

     Then he suddenly plummets into the water, like a trap-door has

     opened beneath him.

     ANGLE ON BUBBLES floating to the surface.  White's FACE rises

     slowly out of the water.

     WIDER  -  CITY SKYLINE

     A SMALL OBJECT floats towards the ground at the end of a tiny

     white parachute.

     BACK ON WHITE

     He swims across to a small boat, climbs aboard, pushes himself

     silently through the still canals of the city.

     EXT.  HARBOUR

     Oil tankers move silently through inky water.

     White paddles the boat to the bottom of A PIER, climbs a rotten

     ladder.  He runs off into the shadows.

     BACK IN THE WATER

     The PUPPET cuts through the waves, pushed along by a rear

     propeller.  It reaches the pier, climbs to the top.  The prop

     retracts, and the creature wheels forward slowly, onto a

     concrete surface.  It looks around  -  it knows White is there

     somewhere.

     PUPPET'S P.O.V.

     A trail of WET FOOTPRINTS on the ground.  It follows them, is

     led to a crane cabin.

     INSIDE THE CRANE'S CABIN  -  is White, a lunatic grin on his

     face, at the controls.

     A NOISE O.S. startles the puppet.  It looks up.

     PUPPET'S P.O.V.

     Follows the crane up into the air.  The crane is swinging around

     against the dark sky.  A HUGE METAL CONTAINER dangles, stops

     above the puppet.

     ON WHITE

                         WHITE

               Nice knowing you.

     TIGHT ON WHITE'S HAND  -  It pulls a lever.

     THE CONTAINER  -  Shakes and starts to fall.

     THE PUPPET  -  Screams up at the plummeting container.

     WIDER

     The container crashes into the ground, crushing the creature.

     Silence.  Dust floats in the air.

     EXT.  STREET

     BUMSTEAD's running.  He looks a mess, clutching a bleeding gash

     in his side, cuts on his face, clothes torn  -  but he made it

     out alive...

                                              CUT TO:

     EXT. ROOF-TOP

     BUMSTEAD sits on the ground, leans against a wall, breathing

     heavily  -  he's losing a lot of blood.

     He waits.

     A NOISE O.S. startles him  -  A FIGURE in the shadows across the

     roof.

                         BUMSTEAD

               White?

     It's too big to be White.  The man steps from the shadows.

                         STROMBOLI (walking forward)

               Hello, Bumstead.

     He's holding a gun, levelled at the inspector.  Bumstead lies

     bleeding, against the wall.  He points his own gun at the

     advancing man and pulls the trigger.

     CLICK!  CLICK!  CLICK!

                         BUMSTEAD

               Dammit.

     Stromboli is upon him, grabs the empty gun, throws it away,

     picks up the inspector, leans him against the wall.  Without

     Stromboli holding him up, Bumstead would not be able to stand.

                         STROMBOLI

               Why do you always have to find things

               out the hard way!  Couldn't you just

               do your job, you idiot?  I told you,

               didn't I?  These people are not

               playing games, Bumstead.  They can do

               anything they want, don't you

               understand?

                         BUMSTEAD (a hiss)

               You're one of them.  You bastard...

                         STROMBOLI (laughing)

               In a way, we 

all

 are, inspector!

               You.  Me.  Everybody!

     Stromboli carries Bumstead towards the EDGE of the roof.  He

     keeps laughing.

                         STROMBOLI

               Time for that early retirement,

               Bumstead.  Didn't bring the gold watch

               I'm afraid.

                         BUMSTEAD (weakly)

               No...  Please...

     INSPECTOR'S P.O.V.

     THE EDGE looms up  -  a long drop to the street.

     EXT.  STREET

     White paces nervously through empty streets.  He stops, to get

     his bearings, then turns and runs into:

     A SILHOUETTED FIGURE in a bizarre metal contraption on wheels.

     A skeletal hand reaches out to White, grabs his arm.  An inhuman

     moan.

     Terrorised, White pulls back.

                         FIGURE

               Ahhh...  it hurts!...

     The mechanized figure trundles forward, pins him to a wall.  A

     streetlight reveals...

     DOCTOR SCHREBER covered in blood, encased in a metal framework

     covered in silver blades.

                         WHITE

               What happened to you?

                         SCHREBER

               I'm...  being...  punished.

     The blades are connected to the wheels  -  they turn when he

     moves forward, metal cuts into his flesh, slowly SKINNING HIM

     ALIVE.  A torture machine.  Between screams of intense pain, the

     doctor speaks.

                         SCHREBER

               I had to  -  ahhhh  -  find you...  I..

               I...

     The doctor shuts his eyes, a trickle of blood runs down his

     face.

                         WHITE

               What is it?

                         SCHREBER

               We are...  living in their dreams...

     Schreber turns and rolls off into the night, screaming  -  BLADES

     SPIN furiously, peeling back flesh.  He glances at White one

     last time.

                         SCHREBER

               Insect...  dreams...

     EXT.  STREET

     WHITE is running.  As he approaches the building he hears a

     scream  -  looks up to see a figure PLUNGE OFF the roof.

     He runs over.  Looks down at the twisted body.  THE INSPECTOR

     moans  -  barely alive.  White kneels by his side.

     BUMSTEAD'S hand moves across to an expanding POOL of red beside

     him, traces an 'H' on the ground in the blood.

                         WHITE (reading)

               Aitch?

     The inspector seems to be dying, then revives momentarily, puts

     A MAP in white's hand, looks up at him:

                         BUMSTEAD

               Gesundheit!

     His eyes roll up and he GOES LIMP.  White stares at the body,

     then:

                         WHITE

               I didn't sneeze.

     INT.  MORGUE  -  NIGHT

     The MORTICIAN turns off the lights in the main hall and steps

     into his office, sits down, pours himself a hot drink; turns on

     the radio, opens his conic-book.

     A NOISE O.S. disturbs him and he gets up, walks out of his

     office, looks into the darkness.

     HIS P.O.V. PANS around the empty morgue.  Nothing.  Decides to go

     back to his office.  He turns and is startled by three MYSTERY

     MEN obstructing his path.

                         MAN 1

               We are looking for the White victims.

                         MORTICIAN

               And who the hell are 

you

?

     The mortician catches a glimpse of the shiny dagger Man 1 is

     clutching by his side.  He becomes very scared.

                         MORTICIAN

               Over there.  Numbers eight to twelve.

     THREE MEN look over to where the mortician has pointed in

     unison.  Man 1 looks back.

                         MAN 1

               Thank you.

     A FLASH OF STEEL.  The mortician's throat SPOUTS blood.  He grabs

     reflexively at the gash and falls back onto the floor, DEAD

     before he hits the tiles.

     The Mystery Men step to an adjoining chamber.  Man 2 puts down a

     Box he is carrying, opens the lid.  A green glow oozes out.  The

     other Men manipulate levers on a control panel on a nearby

     wall.  Stainless steel doors open.  Body-length trays slide into

     the dim light.  SHAPES covered in white sheets.

     Man 2 with the box removes a GLASS SYRINGE, filled with a

     glowing green liquid.  He steps TO THE BODIES and injects each

     with the syringe, through the sheets.  When he has finished he

     steps back, places the syringe back in the box.  The MEN leave

     silently.

     All is silent and still.

     Then the shape beneath a sheet starts to SIT UP.  Then another,

     and another.

     INT.  CORRIDOR  -  NIGHT

     WHITE is running again, clutching BUMSTEAD'S MAP.

     CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP

     REVEALS the entire corridor.  KEEPS PULLING BACK  -  until the

     view is impossibly wide  -  like a cross-section of the building

     he's in, a doll's house with the roof taken off.  The TINY

     FIGURE runs, amidst a dark network of surrounding rooms and

     passages.

     CONTINUE PULL BACK

     White is no more than a SPECK  -  the hall-way stretches

     ENDLESSLY in both directions, behind and in front of the moving

     figure, through an infinite labyrinth.

     WIDER STILL

     We no longer make out the figure.  The x-rayed environment

     resembles some intricate aerial map of the vast city  -  the

     corridor an ever increasing SPIRAL.

     INT.  ORNATE APARTMENT BUILDING  -  NIGHT

     White reaches the top of a spiral flight of stairs.

     HIS P.O.V.

     APARTMENT 'H'  -  a rusted metal letter on the door.  White steps

     forward.  He knocks once and the door creaks open, unlocked.

     INSIDE

     The rooms are empty, derelict, strewn with rubbish.  Mould grows

     on the damp walls.  A door stands at the end of a long empty

     room.  He can hear the muffled sounds of SURF, SEAGULLS.  White

     starts to walk forward, smiling.  As he approaches the door he

     begins to feel colder.

     He opens the door and looks out.  A blast of SUNLIGHT  -  blue

     ocean and sky.

                         VOICE O.S.

               John White...

     White does not turn about, he takes a step forward, then

     another  - and RUNS INTO THE SKY  - A PAINTED WALL. He glances up

     at a small SPEAKER built into the wall  -  the SOURCE of the sea-

     side SOUND EFFECTS.

     He hears the click of the gun being cocked behind him.  Hopes

     dashed, he turns.  ANGLE ON A MYSTERY MAN  -  a gun pointed at

     White's stomach.

                         MYSTERY MAN

               There is nothing, Mister White.

               Beyond the city.  Never has been.

               Unfortunate.  Yes?

     White is led into a pitch black room.

     INSIDE

     TIGHT ON WHITE'S FACE  -  In the darkness  -  he looks across to

     the Mystery Man standing beside him.

                         WHITE

               How did you know where to find me?

                         MYSTERY MAN

               We knew you would turn up here

               eventually...  Been waiting for you,

               yes.  Hoped you wouldn't make a

               nuisance of yourself on the way...

     The Man motions with the gun for White to walk forward.  As soon

     as White turns to do this, the Man slips from the room and

     shuts the door, cutting off any existing light.

     A NOISE O.S.  -  some kind of machine being turned on  -  lights

     start to come up all over the room.

     It's a normal, average-sized, living room.  All the furniture

     has been removed and replaced with chairs, tables, podiums  -  an

     arrangement resembling an IMPROVISED COURT of law.  In fact,

     White realizes he is standing behind some kind of witness box.

     The apartment is devoid of people, though almost immediately a

     door opens to the side (looks like it would lead to the

     kitchen) and a series of figures step through.  MYSTERY MEN.

     All the MEN take up specific positions around the room, without

     uttering a word, but don't sit.  One MYSTERY MAN opens a curtain

     beneath an arched entrance  -  beyond it, within a very small

     room, stand DOZENS OF PEOPLE, crammed shoulder to shoulder.  The

     people stare at White silently  -  a bizarre gallery of

     spectators.

     An eerie silence falls on the room.

     The kitchen door opens again.  White is shocked to see the

     VICTIMS WALK INTO the room and adopt positions in what is

     obviously the area for the jury.

     The DISEMBOWELED CORPSE OF A WOMAN steps out of the shadows,

     pushing a pram.  Her throat is cut, she is shrouded in a white

     sheet.

     Within the pram is the BABY clutching its own head, with spine

     attached, under its arm.

     Then the mutilated FREDRICK hops out, followed by the three

     brown blood-stained paper parcels containing what is left of

     the YOUNG BOY.

     Finally, his WIFE and the JAPANESE WOMAN, still in passionate

     embrace, take their positions.

     Another door opens  -  a closet. Within stands the figure we have

     only seen as a shadow  -  the elderly MYSTERY MAN with the cane.

     MISTER BLACK slowly reaches above him and pulls at a chain

     hanging from the ceiling  -  the light snaps on inside the

     closet.  Somewhere, a long way off in the same building, a

     toilet is heard flushing.

     He is much older than the rest, carries himself with authority

     as he hobbles across the room to a raised podium, supporting

     his withered body on his cane.  Looks like he will play JUDGE.

     Everyone in the room now sits.  Mister Black looks at White.

     ANGLE ON WHITE  -  He starts to tremble, not so much from fear,

     but cold.

                         MISTER BLACK

               Welcome.

     White just looks at him, still clutching the small notebook

     called:  ANSWERS.

                         MISTER BLACK

               John White, you are to be tried for

               murder, yes.  You wish to confess to

               these crimes now?

     White is silent.  He leans over and scratches his legs through

     the fabric of his trousers.  They itch like crazy.

     Mister Black turns to the assembled people.

                         MISTER BLACK

               Very well.  The testimony of the

               prosecutors.  Yes.

     TWO MYSTERY MEN stand and step across to a wooden easel.  MAN 1

     stands beside it, reveals a series of visuals, charts, etc.

     drawn on stiff cardboard.  MAN 2 uses a pointer while he

     describes the evidence to support their case.

                         MYSTERY MAN 2

               We will show that John White is

               abnormal, a menace to society, a

               dangerous sick individual, and that

               the court should have no mercy in

               finding him guilty and punishable to

               the extreme for his crimes.

     MAN 1 places a large black and white photo blow-up on the

     easel.  It shows White at the door of the JAPANESE WOMAN'S

     apartment, clutching a kitchen knife, covered in blood.

                         MYSTERY MAN 1

               Exhibit A shows the accused leaving

               the scene of his most recent crime,

               yes.  A photo taken by a remote camera

               planted by one of our agents.

     White watches in stunned silence.

     A general murmur of agreement through the room as the point is

     made.  Mister Black turns to the victims, nods his head slowly.

                         MYSTERY MAN 2

               Exhibit B...

     MAN 1 removes a small tape recorder, hands it to MAN 2.

                         MYSTERY MAN 2

               Actual tape recording of accused

               committing aforementioned crime, yes.

     He turns a switch, the reels spin slowly.  A hush fills the

     room.

                         VOICE 1 (sounds like JAPANESE WOMAN)

               No...  Please...

     A scream.

                         VOICE 2 (sounds like White)

               Shut up!

     Another scream.  A ripping sound.

                         VOICE 3 (sounds like his WIFE)

               John!  Don't...

     Another scream.

     White is standing up, involuntarily, he can't listen to this

     any longer.

                         WHITE (a squeak, almost inaudible)

               Stop it!  This is a lie...

     Mister Black turns to White.  The Men testifying stop the tape

     and look at him also.

                         MISTER BLACK

               Something to say?  Ready to confess?

     The Men in the audience turn and all stare at White, as do the

     victims and the spectators in the adjoining room.

                         WHITE (back to a whisper)

               I didn't kill anyone.

                         MISTER BLACK

               Speak up.  Yes.

                         WHITE (finds his voice)

               It's lies.  Everything.

     He grips the barrier before him.

     A SHRIEK from the pram containing the BABY  -  it rocks violently

     from side to side.

     The DISEMBOWELED WOMAN rises from her chair.  She has difficulty

     standing, her limbs stiff.  She looks at White, opens her mouth

     to say something, but no sound comes out.  Instead a tiny RED

     CRAB scuttles out, across her face, and falls to the ground.

     She sits down.

     White is stunned.

                         MISTER BLACK

               Bring the witnesses.

     AN OLDER COUPLE are led out of the kitchen by a Mystery Man.

     Shown to seats behind a podium.  The woman looks sadly at White.

                         MISTER BLACK

               You are the accused's parents?

                         FATHER

               That's right.

                         MOTHER

               Yes.

                         WHITE

               Wait a minute...

                         MISTER SLACK

               You had your turn!  Let them speak.

                         WHITE (angry)

               My parents are supposed to be dead!

               You can't keep changing the damn

               rules like this!  Why go through this

               ridiculous set-up!  Why don't you

               just kill me and be done with it!

                         MISTER BLACK (smiles at parents)

               Please, continue...

                         WHITE

               This is insane!

     He looks over to the victims.

                         WHITE

               It was 

them

, not me.

                    (points at the

                    Mystery Men)

               They killed you.

     Looks back at the Mystery Men.

                         WHITE

               You have invented all this.  History

               is a lie, not just mine, everyone's  -

               a fiction.  

You

 are the authors.

     His knuckles go white as he squeezes tighter on the barrier.

                         MISTER BLACK

               A fanciful idea, Mister White.

                         WHITE

               Everyone has a job  -  a function.  Each

               one teaches you more about your

               invention.  I'm what is called a

murderer

.

     The whole court listens in silence to White's testimony.

                         WHITE

               You've given everybody memories, but

               I missed out.  The Doctor saw to that

               -  played your own game.  And now...

     WHITE looks at the MYSTERY MEN, then back at MISTER BLACK.

                         WHITE

               You're trying to get rid of me.

     There is silence.  Whispers.  Faces staring.

                         WHITE

               Why do I threaten you?  You're scared

               aren't you?

     MISTER BLACK and the gathered MYSTERY MEN look speechless at

     White.  Suddenly everyone bursts into spontaneous LAUGHTER, led

     by Mister Black.

     A terrible cackle fills the room  -  all the MYSTERY MEN laugh

     hysterically, so do the mutilated victims.  The spectators in

     the adjoining room remain silent.

                         MISTER BLACK

               Ah  -  a 

plot

.  Now we have a plot!

                    (chuckling)

               Very inventive...

     The older couple behind the podium look disturbed.

                         MOTHER

               Please, John, you're embarrassing

               us...

                         WHITE

               Shut up!

                         MISTER BLACK (chuckling still)

               You have proof?  Evidence?  Yes?

                         WHITE (holds up notebook)

               It's all here!

     Mister Black seems startled by the book, then pretends it's

     nothing.

                         MISTER BLACK

               A book of delusions.  Anything else?

                         WHITE

               But I...

                         MISTER BLACK

               I see.

                    (turns to the

                    victims)

               The verdict, yes...

                         WHITE

               Wait, this isn't fair...

     The DISEMBOWELED WOMAN stands again.  This time she opens her

     mouth, there is a bubbling noise, water runs out, then:

                         DISEMBOWELED WOMAN (whisper)

               Guil  -  ty...

     White is agitated, fear in his face.  Mister Black stamps SOME

     PAPERS before him repeatedly.

     ON THE PAPERS  -  official-looking documents.  The stamp says:

     GUILTY.

     CLOSE on White's eyes.

                         MISTER BLACK

               Before I pronounce sentence...

     Suddenly the papers on the bench in front of Mister Black BURST

     INTO FLAMES.  Mister Black recoils, almost falling off his

     chair, taken by surprise.  The Mystery Men all look at White, a

     murmur of concern.

     Mister Black looks up at White  -  angered.

                         MISTER BLACK

               How dare you use your tricks on me!

     White, genuinely surprised, looks around.  Several Mystery Men

     BACK AWAY from him, scared.

                         WHITE

               I didn't realise...

                         MISTER BLACK

               Shut up, freak!  Monster!  You are

               insignificant.

     He glares across the room, angrily.  An WOODEN CHAIR in a corner

     starts to vibrate.

     CLOSE on Mister Black's eyes.

     The chair rises into the air  -  HURLS across the room at White.

     Mister Black laughs as it crashes into the wall.  White ducks

     just in time.

     The gathered Mystery Men erupt into enthusiastic applause.

     White regains his composure and tries some mind tricks of his

     own.  He lifts a small table into the air, and makes it spin  -

     a knife and fork dance back and forth on the surface, as several

     plates (from a stack in the kitchen) hurl, firstly at the

     spinning table, then go flying across the room, smashing near

     Mister Black, making him dance back and forth comically.

     This display is accompanied by a rousing rendition of a WALTZ

     playing on a floating gramophone White has also activated with

     his mind.

     SEVERAL Mystery Men are TERRIFIED.  White is amazed at his own

     performance.

                         MISTER BLACK

               You'll regret that.

     Mister Black is furious, spluttering, spit flying from his

     mouth.

                         MISTER BLACK (shouts)

               SHUT IT DOWN!

     A Mystery Man by the window, picks up a phone and dials

     furiously.  Everyone in the room remains silent  -  waiting.

                         MAN ON PHONE

               Yes, we have a problem here.  Shut it

               down immediately.

     White doesn't understand what is going on.  O.S. the SOUND of

     machinery WINDING DOWN.

     ANGLE ON a clock hanging on the wall.  ON the SECOND HAND.  It

     suddenly STOPS.

     All eyes are on Mister Black.

                         MISTER BLACK

               This has all gone too far.  Yes, much

               too far.

     Mister Black starts to SHAKE.  His eyes shut, clenches his

     teeth, grips the insect on his cane, plants his feet firmly to

     the floor.

     Around the room WALLS CRACK, plaster rains down from the

     ceiling...

                                              CUT TO:

     EXT.  CITY  -  NIGHT

     All over the city things START TO FALL APART  -  a devastating

     impact on the landscape.

     MONTAGE

     A street CRACKS OPEN.  Beneath the pavement are pulsating

     intestine-like organs.  These burst open with pus...

     A building vanishes...

     A car on a street corner flies into the air...

     A telephone box STARTS TO SPIN, faster and taster, digging

     itself into the concrete.  Monstrous INSECT LEGS sprout from the

     hole left behind...

     Geysers of STEAMING BILE spurt into the night sky...

     BLACK EXCREMENT forces up out of a sewer, runs down stone

     steps...

     THE CITY is coming apart...

                                              CUT BACK TO:

     INT.  APARTMENT H'

     The room looks like an earthquake hit it  -  broken furniture and

     gaping holes torn in the walls.

     Several MYSTERY MEN huddle behind an upturned table, watching

     WHITE and MISTER BLACK.  They face each other, both still

     standing  - mental energies focused against each other in battle.

     The fighting is taken its toll on both men.

     A DAGGER hangs suspended in mid-air, slowly rotating to face

     White with its shining silver blade.

     Mister Black is clenching his rotting teeth, tightening bony

     fists by his side.  Pushing every ounce of mental power at the

     knife.

     White, bleeding from a gash in his cheek, is straining his mind

     against the knife.

     The blade STARTS TO MOVE, ever so slowly at first, towards

     White.  His body is shaking with his mental effort.  A bead of

     sweat runs down his brow, dripping into his eye, blurring his

     vision.

     He is losing.

     INT.  KITCHEN  -  NIGHT

     We see an OUT OF FOCUS IMAGE.  A group of dark figures.  WHITE

     regains consciousness, strapped to a kitchen table.  From his

     perspective, in the immediate foreground, a figure speaks as he

     removes a syringe from White's FOREHEAD.

                         FIGURE

               Good as new.  Yes.  Everything is

               easier now.

     His vision CLEARS, he can see.  It's MISTER BLACK.  Behind him a

     SMALL CROWD who turn out to be MYSTERY MEN.

     Mister Black suddenly pulls at his own face, removes the mask.

     Underneath is a mess of PULSATING ORGANS AND INSECT PARTS.

     This is what Mystery Men really look like.  He laughs, starts to

     MOVE rhythmically  -  a strange dance-step.  The others join in,

     as they too pull off masks.

     Each Man reaches up to his left ear in unison.  They pull

     squirming INSECTS out, hold them up to the light.  The insects

     scream triumphantly.

     White screams too.  And he can't stop.

     Everything goes BLACK.  Then the sound of a key rattling in a

     lock.  A door slowly creaks open...

     INT.  SEASIDE HOTEL ROOM  -  DAY

     A P.O.V. enters a small room.

     Dappled SUNLIGHT through a tattered lace curtain. A clock ticks

     on a wall.  A cough O.S. from the corridor.  A FAT MAN, talks as

     he enters:

                         FAT MAN

               It's small but clean...

                    (it isn't)

               ...and the view's nice.

                    (points to window)

               Isn't it?

     JOHN WHITE enters.  He is haggard, eyes rimmed with red.  He

     still holds the small black NOTEBOOK, tight to his chest.  He

     stands in the centre of the room, looks up.  Strangely, though

     the room is very small, it extends upwards several stories  -

     windows sit at various heights.

     White walks to the lace curtain, opens it with shaking hands.

     OUTSIDE

     A narrow street and at the end, the ocean.  The sound of distant

     surf, he can taste the salt spray.

                         WHITE (without turning)

               I'll take it.

     The man behind him blows his nose loudly and turns to go,

     shutting the door.  White puts the notebook down on a table near

     the open window.

     LATER

     White has fallen asleep on the bed.

     He wakes, troubled.  Stands and walks over to the sink next to

     the bed.  He moves like he is underwater.  The sea-breeze tugs at

     the curtain, draws him to the window.

     HIS P.O.V.

     Down the street to the small patch of sand between buildings.

     TWO FIGURES  approach each other.

     He pulls out his wallet and removes the torn photo of the

     woman, places it against the pillow on the bed.  He sits on the

     edge of the bed and lifts his trousers, looks at his legs

     nothing out of the ordinary.

     White is disturbed by a TINY MOVEMENT in his coat pocket.  He

     reaches in and pulls out a small, EMACIATED FISH.

     Disgusted, he drops the fish to the floor, looks at the

     creature.  White raise his foot.  His heel comes down with a

     sickening SQUISH.

     THE CAMERA MOVES IN STEADILY towards the notebook near the

     window.  As the SHOT TIGHTENS we can read the title on the

     cover:  ANSWERS  -  BY JONATHAN WHITE, AGE NINE.

     Now a sudden GUST OF WIND blows open the book.  The pages

     flicker past.  Glimpses of happy things.  A child's drawings of

     smiling people.  The sun shining down on a blue ocean full of

     sailing boats.  Fields of colourful flowers.  Cute animals.

     INT.  LONG CORRIDOR  -  DAY

     SOUND OF SURF, distant, muffled.

     CAMERA MOVES slowly towards a door.  The final door  -  no

     others beyond this.  ECHOIC FOOTSTEPS.

     TIGHT ON WHITE  -  His haggard face moves through darkness.  He

     looks down at his walking feet.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  White sees water, waves breaking, through the

     cracks in the floorboards of the hallway.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     The cracks around the closed door are illuminated, white-hot,

     by the SUN outside.

     ON HIS HAND  -  As he reaches towards the handle.

     ON HIS FACE  -  As the door opens.  A sharp line of light cuts

     across his features, as his eyes blink and water.  The wind

     pulls at his messy hair.  SURF NOISE is louder now.

     REVERSE ANGLE  -  WIDER  -  OUTSIDE looking through the door,

     along a long wooden pier jutting out into a blue seascape.  At

     the end of the pier stands the tiny figure of A WOMAN WITH RED

     HAIR.  She looks out at the ocean, her back turned.

     ANGLE LOOKS BACK at White standing in the open doorway, squints

     into the sun.  Suddenly he looks relieved, almost happy for the

     first time.  He steps OUT OF FRAME briskly  -  a weight gone

     from his shoulders.  Everything is clear finally, he knows

     exactly what to do.

     A voice recites names over a P.A. system.

     REVERSE ANGLE

     A TRACKING SHOT follows White, moves down the pier toward the

     woman.  As White steps up to her, she turns and smiles.

                         WOMAN  (indicates the sea)

               Beautiful.

     White nods slowly.  He looks out of place in his crumpled suit.

     He stares out at the ocean.  Seagulls fly over.  Sun reflects

     off waves.

                         WHITE

               Yes...

                         WOMAN

               What's your name?

     He looks at her.  Smiles.  Then, slowly, brings his hands to her

     throat.

                         WHITE

               John...  White.

     FADE TO BLACK
