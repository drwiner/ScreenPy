1   INT. HILLSIDE VILLA - MORNING                                 1

    Stare at my broken face in a gilded mirror. The breaks

    occurred a lifetime ago, healed uneven. I wear a white

    tropical button-down, a Republican-gold Rolex, a pirate-patch

    over what was my left eye.

                        ME (V.O.)

              I'm old. And all I have left is the

              will to remember...

    I reach into a dresser drawer, pull out a yellowed black &

    white picture of HER: this beatific blonde, sleeping. Below

    me is a week-old L.A. Times with the headline: Matriarch of

    Television Series, Empire Ridge, Retires.

    The Matriarch's picture in the middle.                            *

                        ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)

              ...and the fear I'll forget...

    Slide HER over the Matriarch's picture: the Matriarch 30

    years younger now. Lift my eyes back to my reflection.

                        ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)

              I killed innocent men. I betrayed

              sacred oaths. I reaped profit from

              horror. The names are dead or too

              guilty to tell. The events so

              brutal they beg to be re-told...

    Legend: Los Angeles, Fall 1958

2   INT. OLYMPIC AUDITORIUM - FIGHT NIGHT                         2

    The battered face of an Irish Pug. Same guy? No. A hard jab

    bashes the Pug out of frame. And there I am: next to the

    `Ring' Magazine Reporter chewing the ass out of his cigar.

                        ME (V.O.)

              Lieutenant Dave Klein, Vice

              Division. LAPD. That's what my face

              looked like before.

    My point of view now: Irish Pug on the business end of this

    bantam Black's combos. Standing to my left: SERGEANT RICHARD

    "JUNIOR" STEMMONS. Twenty-six.

                                                             2.

                        ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)

              Junior Stemmons. A partner I never

              asked for. The scowl meant to hide

              a shit-scared kid who'd been

              teaching evidence classes three

              months ago. His Old-Man was an LAPD

              lifer who never got past Sergeant.

                        JUNIOR STEMMONS

              We should make our move now.

                        ME

              Mid-fight? Look at the crowd: you

              wanna be at the center of a riot?

                        JUNIOR STEMMONS

              I don't wanna be here when Noonan

              and the Feds show up.

    I point at the bantam Black:

                        ME

              We let Sanderline finish this

              beating, we get his gratitude.                          *

    Junior eyes the exits clockwise, nervous, waiting for

    `Untouchables' to break the doors down. I hate the way panic

    smells when I stand this close to it.

                        JUNIOR STEMMONS

              We gonna let Rock-a-bye fight too-

                        ME

              -relax Junior.

3   INT. LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER                              3

    The Bantam Black: SANDERLINE JOHNSON. Led through the double

    doors. He sees me, then his gaze shifts to Junior popping

    jabs inches from REUBEN RUIZ: a muscled middle-weight, fight-

    taped hands cuffed behind his back. I smile big:

                        ME

              Sanderline, I'm Lieutenant Klein of

              the LAPD and a real big fan-

                        JUNIOR STEMMONS

              -you're under arrest.

    Sanderline spooks, steps back. Turn and make sure Junior sees

    the fire in my eyes, keep staring at Junior as I speak to

    Sanderline again:

                                                             3.

                        ME

              No you're not. Reuben is-

                        REUBEN RUIZ

              -Lieutenant Dave why you arrest-

                        ME

              -for being a ranked fighter who

              still steals hubcaps. Shut up.

                  (off Ruiz, back to

                   Sanderline)

              If I was gonna arrest you, I

              wouldn't have let you finish: and

              that hook-uppercut combo you got is

              something special.

                  (from Reuben, beat)

              Reuben's in custody. But you could

              be our Guest. Whaddya say?

4   EXT. OLYMPIC AUDITORIUM - MOMENT LATER                        4

    Me, Junior, Reuben, and Sanderline aim for the nearest exit.

    Behind the stands. Reuben and Sanderline in street clothes,

    hats pulled down tight. Feature the Announcer:

                        RING ANNOUNCER

              Ladies and Gentleman...due to

              circumstances beyond our control,

              Rock-A-Bye Ruiz will not fight this-

    -BOOS drown the PA. Beer and lit cigars shell the Announcer.

    Fights erupt in the stands. I can't stifle a chuckle. Three

    exits down: day late-dollar short Feds. WELLES NOONAN, elbows-

    out, surveying the scene like a half-assed Rommel.

                        ME (V.O.)

              Welles Noonan, US Attorney. Ivy

              League Crimefighter. Launching a

              big boxing probe as a way to begin

              prying into everything else crooked

              and corrupt in LA.

    Move faster.

                        ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)

              Unaware the LAPD was walking away

              with his two big witnesses.

    As we near the side exit I stop. Junior pauses, less than a

    foot from my face, pointing up at Noonan, pure panic.

                                                             4.

                        JUNIOR STEMMONS

              C'MON-JESUS-HE'S RIGHT THERE!

    My P.O.V.: second row, washed-up gangster Mickey Cohen with a

    Blonde far too beautiful for his world, a woman you've seen

    before, but only in a yellowed B&W picture 30 years in the

    future. I can't take my eyes away...five seconds-

                        JUNIOR STEMMONS (CONT'D)

              -HE SEES US!

    Noonan's gaze strafes us. I see him squint.

                        ME

              Then you can stop pointing at him.

    Double-time out the double-doors.

5   INT. AMBASSADOR HOTEL - NIGHT                                 5

    9th floor suite. All four of us. I order room service.

                        ME

              Hungry Sanderline?

    Sanderline digs the digs: sports the Ambassador robe over his

    street clothes, reading the Bible.

                        SANDERLINE JOHNSON

              If they got shrimp.

                        ME

                  (into the phone)

              Shrimp cocktail.

                  (over to Reuben)

              You want something Reuben?

                        REUBEN RUIZ

              To know why the fuck I'm here-

                        JUNIOR STEMMONS

              -mind your tone, Shitbird...

                        REUBEN RUIZ

              Shitbird went out with Vaudeville.

              You get your badge in a cereal box?

                        ME

              You're here because we want you to

              remember where you live.

                                                            5.

                    SANDERLINE

              (grade-school mind)

          City of Angels.

                    ME

          Excellent Sanderline.

                    REUBEN RUIZ

          What?

                    ME

          You live in LA, Asshole. You do not

          live in `Federal Government.'

Ruiz turns `caught-me' pink...I nod to Junior: split `em.

Playing adjoining hotel rooms like sweat boxes.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS

          We get to spend time alone now.

                    REUBEN RUIZ

          Want some perfume?

Junior shoves Ruiz through the inner-door connecting the

rooms. Sanderline giggles. Close the door behind them. Sit

down inches from Sanderline, change my tone:

                    ME

          Stop laughing.

Instant quiet.

                    ME (CONT'D)

          What were you gonna tell Welles

          Noonan?

              (watch as he flinches)

          He has a subpoena with your name on

          it, Sanderline. Why would someone

          like you need to talk to the U.S.

          Attorney?

Sanderline staying silent...

                    ME (CONT'D)

          You're a legbreaker for the Mob. I

          know the Men that pay you for that

          will murder you if they hear you're

          about to talk to the U.S.-

                    SANDERLINE JOHNSON

          -but they don't know...

                                                         6.

                    ME

              (beat, small smile)

          And they don't have to. Now tell me

          what you were gonna tell Noonan-

-phone rings. Sanderline flinches for the second time.

                    SANDERLINE

          Bet you they ran outta shrimp.

I stand, step, answer it:

                    ME

          Yeah.

                    UNIDENTIFIED VOICE (O.S.)

          The Spook with you?

Mild shock. Catalogue potential "who's"...

                    UNIDENTIFIED VOICE (CONT'D)

          C'mon, we know he is. We're just

          trying to be mysterious-

                    ME

          -who's `we?'

                    UNIDENTIFIED VOICE (O.S.)

          Me and Sam G.

                    ME (V.O.)

          G for `Giancana.' I owe him favors

          for the rest of my life.

                    UNIDENTIFIED VOICE (O.S.)

          We're out at the place in Palm

          Springs. You should come out for

          the weekend.

                    ME

          Tell Sam if I get minute-

                    UNIDENTIFIED VOICE

          -yer gonna have to make a minute

          for him. Now. See, we think the

          Spade might testify that Sam owns

          him and how we was grooming him for

          a title shot he was gonna tank. A

          fight everybody woulda' got flush

          off of, including the Spade.                        *

              (beat, quieter)

          Have him look out the window Klein.

                                                               7.

    Click. A breath. Drop the phone on the cradle...step to the

    window...open it...then I chuckle genuine:

                        ME

              Sanderline, you gotta see this...

    Trusting puppy Sanderline steps to the window:

                          SANDERLINE JOHNSON

              What'm I-

    -smash his head against the frame using his forward motion.

    He loses muscle control for the split-second it takes me to

    pitch his legs up and out. My face a quick-change evil mask.

    Feature Sanderline's nine-story fall. That Ambassador Hotel

    robe billows behind him like a cape. He detonates an overhead

    streetlight with a bomb sound, then hits the driveway.

    Unzip my fly, hustle into the bathroom, screams from outside

    now. Flush the toilet as Junior and Ruiz pile through the

    door. Step out, play it baffled: look at the bed where

    Sanderline sat, then the open window, screams floating up...

                        ME

              DID THAT MUTT JUST JUMP?

    Lunge to the window: Sanderline post-mortem. Head shattered.

    Valets sprinting. Junior on the phone. Ruiz steps-up next to

    me: horrified. I keep staring at the smashed body...whisper:

                        ME (CONT'D)

              Remember where you live.

    Reuben has to use both hands to steady himself.

6   INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - BRADLEY'S OFFICE - MORNING           6

    Spartan space appointed with high-ticket items like the

    mahogany table around which we sit. Outside: echoes of a

    protest filter through the windows:

                        MUFFLED PROTEST AMALGAM (O.C.)

              MEXICAN BROTHERS SI! IMPERIAL

              DODGERS NO!

    Four of us at the table glued to the T.V, watching U.S.

    Attorney Welles Noonan lambasting the LAPD.

                        ME (V.O.)

              LA's version of the Young Turks,

              only meaner.

                        (MORE)

                                                8.

                    ME (V.O.) (cont'd)

          Boyce Bradley, Chief of Detectives.

          Smartest man in town. And one of

          the richest: Dad was a Real Estate

          Developer who owned a strip of land

          that's now known as the Santa

          Monica Freeway. On either side,

          Bradley's book-ends: D.A. Bob

          Gallaudet, not the smartest man in

          town: `Gas Chamber' Bob cribbed my

          notes at USC Law. And Tom Bethune,

          running for a City Council seat

          that'll decide if this Mexican slum

          called Chavez Ravine gets bulldozed

          and renamed `Dodger Stadium.'              *

                    BRADLEY

          Turn it off.

Bethune leaps like a lapdog, hits the power.

                    ME

          I was pissing. He was jumping.

Bradley picks up a newspaper:

                    BRADLEY

          `US Attorney Noonan is accusing the

          Los Angeles Police Department in

          general, and Lt. David Klein in

          particular, of murder at worst,

          gross incompetence at best...'

                    ME

          Noonan had Sanderline scared. After

          he sang to me he panicked & jumped.

                    TOM BETHUNE

          He did spend a month in Camarillo

          Mental Hospital last year-

                    GAS CHAMBER BOB

          -and wearing that hotel robe over

          his clothes makes him look even

          more looney-bin.

                    TOM BETHUNE

          Plus, Reuben Ruiz recanted. So

          Noonan's Boxing Probe is dead. He's

          got nothing-

                    BRADLEY

          -but time, a mandate and new

          targets...I need to speak to the

          Lieutenant alone.

                                                         9.

Bob and Tom nod, pat my back on the way out: proud uncles

lending support before Dad drops the hammer. Door closes. I

stand, step to the window, big Pro-Mex protest below: Geeks

and placards: `BASEBALL IS AS AMERICAN AS THE TRAIL OF TEARS!

                    BRADLEY (CONT'D)

          Describe to me your duty, as you

          understood it, regarding Sanderline

          Johnson and Reuben Ruiz.

                    ME

          Take both men into custody before

          Noonan and the Feds could, and find                   *

          out what they were going to tell-

                    BRADLEY

          -and why did I choose you for this?

                    ME

          Because I'm a Cop with a law

          degree, and you thought my legal-

                     BRADLEY

          -because your a thug with a law

          degree. Because I thought by now

          you'd be so indebted to this

          Department for not indicting and/or                   *

          imprisoning you, that diligent,

          honest discharge of duty would be

          assured.

              (beat)

          And I made a horrible misjudgment.                    *

                    ME

          Bethune and Gallaudet don't think

          so.

                    BRADLEY

          Bob's happy because he wants to be

          State Attorney General and his most

          likely opponent will be Welles

          Noonan. Tom's happy because Morton

          Diskant, who's leading their City

          Council race, is endorsed by

          Noonan. Thus, they're not seeing

          the larger play.

              (with calculated emphasis)

          Noonan's new target will likely be

          the LAPD itself.

                    ME

          How do you know that?

                                                        10.

                     BRADLEY

          Because that's where I would aim: a

          subpoenaed Federal witness plummets

          to his death in the company of two

          LAPD detectives?

              (beat)

          This screams Police Corruption.                      *

          This offers Noonan the possibility

          of payback in the form of national

          headlines.

I wave it all off:

                    ME

          Johnson did that stint at the Nut

          House -- leak his file to your

          friends at the times-

-and Bradley drops his bomb: Coroner's file. I stare...guess

the contents...try to keep my heart rate in-check...

                    BRADLEY

          My friends would be more interested

          in this.

              (beat, flipping file open)

          Coroner's preliminary: white paint

          chips found embedded in Sanderline

          Johnson's scalp. A matching dent on

          the white window sill. I checked

          with the hotel switchboard and

          found a call was patched to your

          room at about the same time Johnson

          flew out of it.

              (beat, proclamation:)

          It shocks and sickens me that your

          allegiance to the Chicago mob would

          take precedence over the LAPD.

                    ME

              (fuck drawing this out)

          Alright. Where's this going?                         *

              (pull my badge, table it)

          Gun? Shield? What?

                    BRADLEY

          The appearance of disciplinary

          measures taken against you are

          mandated post-Sanderline Johnson,                    *

          so your suspension will be recorded

          but sealed...and kept quiet for now-                 *

                                                           11.

                    ME

          So if the papers or Noonan come

          sniffing around-

                    BRADLEY

          -we can provide adequate proof of

          your dismissal.

                    ME

          But you're not dismissing me.

                    BRADLEY

          Just on paper.

              (closes the file)

          Since I misjudged the Cop I thought

          you were, I'm going to leverage the

          Cop that you are.

Bradley slides the morning paper over. Front page: `Candidate

Diskant Hears The Hue and Cry of The Underclass...' The photo

shows a smiling Diskant, rolled shirt-sleeves, in the middle     *

of a sea of LA Immigrants, all smiling back.                     *

                    BRADLEY (CONT'D)

          Morton Diskant is to be removed

          from the City Council race. The

          means and methods implemented to

          that end I will entrust to you.

                    ME

              (throw a thumb at Bethune)

          You want me to torpedo Diskant so

          your buddy Bethune can win a City                      *

          Council seat uncontested-

                    BRADLEY

          -or spend the next month in lock-up                    *

          before being arraigned on charges                      *

          of gross misconduct and dereliction                    *

          of duty. The preamble before you                       *

          face life in prison for murder.                        *

I stare back. Feel myself getting fitted for strings...

                    BRADLEY (CONT'D)

          Diskant works Saturdays. Late.

Bradley waves me out. I intentionally drag my badge back

across the desk, scratching his Mahogany heirloom.               *

                                                            12.

7   INT. MY 1955 PONTIAC - MORNING                                7

    Hollywood Hills loom in the distance.

                        ME (V.O.)

              Bradley's stooge now. A smart play

              suspending me: a built-in shield                        *

              for him if things go sideways.

    Traffic teeming up Fairfax, tourettes-like glances in my rear-

    view...a Black Buick...maybe mirroring my lane changes.

                        ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)

              Black Buick...five Cars

              back...feels like a tail...

    Brake hard. They hang a left on Fountain.

                        ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)

              ...or maybe I just need sleep.

    Cruising up Nichols Canyon to the pad, cameras and

    copywriters loom on my front lawn.

                        ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)

              Press camped out post-Sanderline,

              looking for quotes to hang me with.                     *

    Slouch in the seat, accelerate, keep looking back...dig that

    geek from the Hearld pissing in my hedges.

8   EXT. WESTWOOD COTTAGE - MORNING                               8

    Up the walkway.

                        ME (V.O.)

              Retreat to Meg's. My kid sister and

              only living family. Mom and Pop

              died in `51 when their first plane

              ride became their last.

    Scoop Meg's LA Herald of the ground. Headlines condemn me.

    Tuck it under my arm as Meg opens the door:

                        MEG

                  (glances from paper to me)

              I already got the Times inside.

                                                            13.

9   INT. WESTWOOD COTTAGE - MOMENTS LATER                         9

    Silver tea-pot over blue flame on olive-drab stove. The Times

    open on the table between us...Same shitty headlines.

                        MEG

              How much is true?

                        ME

              How many times have I lied to you?

                           MEG

              Zero.

    Shrug. Play aloof. Hope it suffices.

                        ME

              You've always liked your Men mean.

     She looks up at me. Feels the shame I shun...                    *

                        ME

              What would Mom and Dad say?

                        ME

              Nothing. That's where I learned it.

    She stands, goes to the stove.

                           MEG

              Poor you.

                        ME

              Yeah, pour me...a cup please.

              Black, no sugar.

    Meg stares darts. I smile to defuse.

                        ME (CONT'D)

              Pretty please.

    She fetches cups and saucers.

                        ME (CONT'D)

              How's work?                                             *

                           MEG

              It's work.

                        ME

              How's Pete?

                                                             14.

                            MEG

               More work.

     Quiet while we wait for the pot...and quiet always means

     creeping sleep: an Enemy I never stop fighting. Force my eyes

     open, shift in my seat: I've been exhausted for years.

     I drift despite my best efforts and for a split second you

     see the Hell I see when sleep wins:

10   INT./EXT. NIGHTMARE                                          10

     Fire where the clouds should be -- POP -- in a backseat,

     point-blank Tommy-gunning two smiling men -- POP -- Marine

     fatigues soaked in blood, plunging my bayonet into a

     cheesecake-white belly -- POP -- that beautiful blonde from       *

     the Olympic, smiling -- POP-                                      *

11   INT. WESTWOOD COTTAGE - SAME MOMENT                          11

     -awake. My leg jerks, kicks a big Wing-Tip. A cup of coffee

     pipes in front of me. Then voices. I turn: PETE BONDURANT has

     his hands on my sister's shoulders.

                         ME (V.O.)

               Big Pete Bondurant. One-time LA

               Sheriff. Bounced when he beat-dead

               a Prisoner who spit at him. A duly

               impressed Howard Hughes hired him

               on as his full-time muscle. My

               Sister's new Hump. My oldest living

               Friend.

                         PETE

                   (turns back at me)

               You look like Death taking a shit.

     Meg cackles.

                         MEG

               He's still got that MGM-face.

                         PETE

               You're still the only guy who ever

               traded movie-potential for Police

               work.

                         MEG

               Because in the movies they make you

               pull your punches.

                                                             15.

     Drain my mug. To Pete:

                         ME

               Wanna do LAPD a favor tonight?

                         MEG

               No. We're going to the Cocoanut-

     -Pete puts an extended index finger in front of Meg's lips,

     which she bends backwards.

                         PETE

               'Favor' mean `free?'

                         ME

               Means $500 an hour.

                         MEG

               Gimme the phone so I can find

               another Date-

                          ME

               -you're the only Woman I know who

               calls Men-

                         MEG

               -you're the only Man I know who

               doesn't call Women.

     Pete laughs, then:                                             *

                         PETE

               What are we doing?

12   EXT. LOW RENT OFFICE BUILDING, EAST LA - NIGHT            12

     Me and Junior in the car. Pete street-side, tucked into the

     shadows -- mimes jacking off, checks his watch. Everybody

     bored. Glance again at the file in my lap:

                          ME (V.O.)

               Morton Diskant, a man who preferred

               migrant workers to million dollar

               ballparks. Beating Bethune in their

               City Council Race despite getting

               outspent 10 to 1.

                   (beat)

               If he wins, the Dodgers don't get a

               Stadium, Mexicans get to keep

               raising chickens two miles from

               City Hall and Bradley makes sure I                   *

               burn for Sanderline Johnson.                         *

                                                        16.

Junior in the backseat, penning in a steno, mouthing

something to himself.

                    ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)

          Junior brought along because he

          begged. Already hip to how many

          ways you can make money with a

          badge.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS

          You got a birthday coming up.

                    ME

          What?

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS

          On the 16th, right? How old?

                    ME

          Old. What are you writing?                          *

Head down, scribbling mid-sentence, makes me wait a beat.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS

          Just notes...about work-

                    ME

          -what `work'?

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS

          Mostly compare and contrast stuff.

          Street work versus textbook-

                    ME

          -chapter 1: don't write shit down.

          Chapter 2: or other Cops might kill                 *

          you.

Junior's look practiced in a mirror: clicks the pen, slides

the steno away.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS

          So you think Noonan will come after

          you for the Sanderline thing? He

          seems like a real hard charger.

Bait him, see if he bites.

                    ME

              (the deadest deadpan)

          I heard he was coming after both of

          us.

                                                                17.

     Feature real concern from Junior.

                         JUNIOR STEMMONS

               What?

                         ME

               Indictments. Prison time. Whole

               nine.

                         JUNIOR STEMMONS

               Holy Jesus. Is this true?

                         ME

               I'm seriously thinking about

               turning Junior...testifying against

               you.

     Junior goes sour...gets he's being goosed. I laugh, glance

     out the windshield: see Diskant finally exiting the office.

                         ME (CONT'D)

               Here we go.

     I start the car, slow-roll up the street. My Hamilton says

     11:04 PM. Streets deserted. Pete walking in Diskant's

     direction now as I continue to roll toward both. Pete close,

     dig his giant head nodding `hello.'

                         ME (V.O.)

               Seen Pete do this a dozen times and

               every time the same thought:

     Pete suddenly puts his back into an left hook: hammers

     Diskant from nowhere as they pass. Instant-ugly crumble.

                         ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)

               God help me if he ever hits me like

               that.

     Pete hoists Diskant by his waist-band, tosses him in the

     backseat. I accelerate out, obeying every law.

                                                       CUT TO:

     PITCH BLACK. Then a series of strobe-flashbulbs: maybe flesh,

     maybe two bodies, maybe both hairy/pale. Then groaning, then

     flickering fluorescent lights make it all look jaundiced.

13   INT. LOW RENT FUCK-TEL ROOM - SAME MOMENT                    13

     Lights now. Diskant awake, trying to loosen his jaw.

                                                          18.

                    ME (V.O.)

          Junior picked up this Quiff jocking

          other Fags in a Men's Room. But

          Quiff was a Law Student who wanted

          his record kept clean.

Quiff nervous but cooing, dick out, on Diskant's thigh.

Junior just as nervous...reloading a camera.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS

          He should suck his dick. Y'know?

          Put the icing on it.

A baffled moment as the comment registers.

                    PETE

          What?

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS

          Tell me that wouldn't sell

          it...plus he's a Communist.

                    ME

          We're ruining his career, not his

          soul. Reload the camera.

Diskant finally speaks: marble-mouthed. Pushes Quiff away:

                    MORTON DISKANT

          Off me!

Don't waste a second: grab Diskant by the hair, narrate his

immediate future.

                    ME

          Drop out of the City Council race

Scanning the room, sizing up the situation, then:               *

          I'll fight you rotten-

                    ME

          -and maybe salvage something that's

          a close cousin to `respect.' But

          what about your wife and kid

          getting hold of those pictures?

                                                             19.

     Wait for the big futile scream/struggle. Keep waiting.

     Diskant just sits. No words. And now I wish he'd cry, throw

     punches, anything...but he doesn't. I turn to Junior:

                         ME (CONT'D)

               Take the Quiff home.

                         QUIFF

               My name's Franklin-

                         ME

               -of course it is.

     Junior pulls Quiff out the door. By his hand. Just Pete, Me,

     and Diskant now. Silent moments drag sour...

                         ME (CONT'D)

               I need a nod from you Morton, let's

               me know you get it-

                         PETE

               Someone from the Times will call

               for a quote. Whatever your reason

               for dropping out make it real.

     As Pete and I turn to leave:

                   (not looking at us)

               You eventually lose the ability to

               reconcile the things you've done to

               people. That's Hell.

     A long moment on me and Pete. Blunted by what we just heard.

     I watch Pete go into Meg's place. Drive on. Stop sign. A

     block away: Black Buick parallel to me. Exhaust plumes. Like

     they're waiting. I keep my eyes on the rear-view as I

     pass...but it just stays put...idling.

15   INT. MY HOME, HOLLYWOOD HILLS - MOMENTS LATER             15

     Lights off but something grabs my eye instantly. Kitchen

     table: a manila envelope. 100 $100-bills. USC season tickets.

     A note: `Thanks for proving Flying Monkeys only live in Oz.

     another futile fight with sleep.

     frenzy hacking up half-starved Jap Soldiers. They dive off

     the Cliffs to escape me: this massive, gray-eyed Marine.

     I dive after them. Bombing toward a world below already

     ablaze. Falling. Gaining on a figure in a bathrobe. This

     guttural scream turns mechanical, like a ring as I recognize

17   EXT. 1284 SOUTH TREMAINE, MAGDALENA RESIDENCE - LATE NIGHT 17

     Police abound. Mostly work-a-day Blues pounding coffee. They

     part as I approach: Dave "Enforcer" Klein half-legend here. A

     plain-clothes breaks through, aims right at me: DAN WILHITE.

                         ME (V.O.)

               Captain Dan Wilhite, Head of the

               LAPD Narcotics Division. A Michigan

               Catholic poisoned by 25 years in

               this desert. Recently divorced

               despite seven kids with his Ex.

                         WILHITE

               Why are you here?

                         ME

               You smell like bourbon Wilhite-

                         WILHITE

               -fuck off. This is handled. And

               pull your idiot partner out of

               there-

                         ME

               -Junior's already here-

                         WILHITE

               -Magdalena was my Snitch, so it's

               my scene.

     -push past him, toward the house.

                         ME

               Then get Bradley on the horn, so

               you can relay that order. I'm here

               on his word. Now, what happened?

                   (dragged out of him)

               Guard dogs are dead. Magdalena's

               missing.

I could give a shit. I just want to

this case to get a quick burial.

          ME

I'll bet. Who made the call?

and buzzed Wilshire Station.                *

Where's the family?

Why's that?                                 *

          WILHITE

He's got a mean streak. And he and          *

Hector had been at each others

throats for months. Have Tommy              *

picked up. He likes to loaf at              *

               Narco is at a missing persons.

     Wilhite gets close, still sneering:

               Get a conviction. Grab Tommy and

               pin this thing fast or you'll have

               a whole division of disgraced cops

               at your front door.

               What are you talking about Wilhite?

                         WILHITE

               You queered the Fed's   Fight Probe

               by killing that boxer   and they

               already had a hard-on   for the LAPD-                   *

               Bradley sent you down   here as

                   (beat, closer)

               Now close this quick.

     Wilhite bolts. I pause. Clarity finally dissolving the            *

     bloodshot: this is the disaster Bradley was talking about:        *

pooches. To Junior:

          She didn't hear barking...so they

23   EXT. UNION STATION BALLROOM - DAY                            23

     Bethune Campaign Fundraiser turned Victory Bash. Big smiles

     beam above sunburned double-chins. Bethune the nucleus of a

     Press circle-jerk. I weave around, lack of sleep and a

     miserably wrinkled suit make me look like something dug up.

                         REPORTER #1

               Councilman Bethune, was Mr. Diskant

               dropping out the only way you could

               have won this race?

                         TOM BETHUNE

               Not at all. My message of civic

               advancement manifested in that

               beautiful blue baseball team was

               starting to hit home.

     Bethune's beam twitches when he sees me weaving past. Give

     him a quick nod, get nothing back: he can't be seen this

     close to the turd in the punch bowl. Moving by:

          a showing after Sanderline Johnson.

                    ME

          He jumped Fritz.

Koenig flashes that grin again.

                    KOENIG

          I'm sure he did. And where is your

          young partner this day?

                    ME

          Working his first big job.

                    KOENIG

          Might the job involve the LAPD's

          most important missing Wetback,

          Hector Magdalena?

My eyes narrow but stay smiling:

                     ME

          It does.

Koenig nods, casts his gaze out over the crowd.

                    KOENIG

          I've known Stemmons since the

          academy. He was a top pupil. A                *

          peculiar little pain in the ass,

          but very good with details.

                                                        37.

                     ME

          Kid might have some climb in him.

               (look back at Bradley)

          Reminds me of another pain in the

          ass.

Koenig roars this big frightening laugh of his.

                    KOENIG

          I'm puzzled as to why the Bradley

          would assign you to the Magdalena                     *

          case when you're neither Homicide

          nor Robbery...

                    ME

          There's no body, and nothing was

          taken except Hector.

                    KOENIG

          He does know how to delegate

          doesn't he...and also I'm sure that

          poor Negro's nosedive has put you

          squarely in his debt.

                    ME

          Something like that.                                  *

                    KOENIG

          Keep me abreast will you? Chief

          Parker is understandably nervous.

          Situations like these tend to yield

          grief...and we've the FBI poking                      *

          around our garden patch.                              *

                    ME

          My ass first Fritz, yours second.

Koenig's big laugh again. Moving toward Bradley now. Then

flashbulbs pop-blind. Panic: snapping pix of me? Relief: not

me. Hollywood types: this Buff McMan Meat-type and Her. I go

slack inches from the Press that yesterday wanted to roll in

my guts...but now they're just as entranced with her as I am.

She and McMan Meat continue past as I stare, she answers his

questions for him. I think her eyes see mine. Then I realize

where I'm standing. Bradley waiting. Focused on me and not

her -- God-damned Eunuch. I step over, speak without preface:

                    ME (CONT'D)

          Tommy Magdalena has gone to ground

          and he's got a war chest to keep

          him there. The only way we take him

          quickly is to issue a citywide APB-

                                      38.

          BRADLEY

-no. We can't risk that. Do you             *

make him for the murderer?

          ME

Yeah. Hector's disappearance is

definitely an inside job. That

whole family feels hinky. The

daughter was all bruises and no

tears and Hector's hop-head wife            *

looks part punching bag.

          BRADLEY

Do you suspect either of the women?         *

          ME

According to Wilhite, they were in

Santa Barbara at the time.

          BRADLEY

Verify that. Where is your partner?

          ME

Vouching in evidence at Wilshire

Station.

           BRADLEY

Keep him on that. He had excellent

ratings as an evidence teacher and          *

I trust him more than you.

    (beat)

Find Tommy Magdalena. Focus

everything on that effort & I want

him apprehended Klein, not killed.

          ME

What about Hector? Still missing.

          BRADLEY

And most likely dead. Find the Son.         *

Stakeout the residence. Put tails

on both the mother and daughter --

I want this investigation working

quietly, and around the clock.

          ME                                *

And what do we do if Hector turns           *

up?                                         *

                                                        39.

                    BRADLEY                                    *

          If he's alive, bring him to me. If

          he's dead, have him John Doe'd at                    *

          the morgue until Noonan can be                       *

          drawn off and this FBI situation                     *

          sorted out.                                          *

                    ME

          Wilhite. He was operating Hector-

                    BRADLEY

          -don't worry about Dan Wilhite. You

          deal directly with me. Now go out

          the back. I don't want the press

          recognizing you.

Swallow my sneer. Push through the service doors. Hard.

Headed back toward the kitchen, an exit sign. I pass an

alcove: Her. Alone. Smoke break. Beauty you almost never get

to examine up close. I stop, stammer, she gives me a once-

over, thinks I'm a Reporter...

                    ME

          You got a light?

                    WOMAN

              (searches my empty hands)

          You got a cigarette?

I fumble for a Chesterfield. She pulls a Zippo slow.

                    WOMAN (CONT'D)

          If you snap a picture of me, I get

          to set you on fire. Fair?

I smile too wide -- fuck. I kill it, try to gather up the

bits of `cool' that shattered with the sophomore smile.

                    ME

          It didn't look like you were all

          that upset with the attention.

                    WOMAN

          Good thing you're not a cop.

                     ME

              (beat)

          How's that?

                    WOMAN

          Your power of observation leaves

          lots to be desired.

                                                             40.

     Lights my cigarette. I hold it in my mouth to hide shaking

     hands.

                            ME

               Thank you.

                         WOMAN

               Don't thank me: these things are

               bad for you.

                         ME

               You believe everything you read?

     Stubs her cigarette.

                         WOMAN

               You believe anything you read?

     She starts walking back the way I came.

                         ME

                   (hail-mary)

               Do you eat Dinner?

                            WOMAN

               No.

     I can't stop watching her, even after she pushes back through

     the double doors, re-entering the fray head-first. I step

     after her. A reporter finally makes me. Random catcalls of

     `Klein! `Hey, Enforcer!' Shutterbugs beeline my way, firing

     flashbulbs from the hip. Close the door quick and bolt.

                         ME (V.O.)

               Make a note: steal Bethune's guest-                     *

               list, then go door-to-door until                        *

               you find her again.

24   INT. WILSHIRE STATION - DAY                                  24

     Down a flight of stairs to the evidence lockers. Junior

What did you tell the Watch

Commander upstairs?

          JUNIOR STEMMONS

    (schoolboy proud)

That this was a random drug

seizure. I'm not using names and

I'm number coding everything.

A load of interesting stuff too.

    (points to each stack)

I got unregistered fire-arms, more

dope than I've ever seen, and some

evidence is in bags?

You don't. Our job is to find

Tommy.

And why is that out?

          JUNIOR STEMMONS

I'm making notes separate from-

    (gear change off my glare)

-I thought we were investigating

Magdalena's disappearance-

          ME

-Don't write shit down. What do you         *

need Kid? A little bouncing ball,           *

bottom of the screen?                       *

a word of that exists on paper?

                                                             42.

               And there's reasons. Respect them.                      *

                          ME (CONT'D)                                  *

               Now we need surveillance set up on

               the house and revolving tails on

               both Madge and Lucille Magdalena.

               Their alibi is they were in Santa

               Barbara when Hector vanished. Find

               out if that's real. The tails and

               the stakeout start tonight.

               Can you manage this?

     Cruise in, crossing the hangar to Pete.

               Howard Hughes. Billionaire germ

               freak. Boob man. Pete's prime

               benefactor. Nobody had seen him in

          Indeed.

              (motions to sit)

          Please.

We sit at a huge drafting table. I shoot a sidelong to Pete.

                    MILTEER (CONT'D)

          Thanks for your time on a Sunday.

                    ME

              (a wink for Pete)

          Where's Mr. Hughes?

                    MILTEER

          Unavailable. Unfortunately. But

          I've been given full authority to-

                    ME

          -I'm not contagious...if that's

          what he's worried about.

Pete hate scowls me: have your fun, Asshole...

                    MILTEER

          I don't find that the least bit

          humorous Lt. Klein.

                    ME

          Yes you do. What's your pitch Mr.                      *

          Milteer?

Milteer looks at Pete. Pete half-shrugs. Back to me now:

                                                44.

                    MILTEER

          An `Actress' named Glenda Bledsoe

          signed a Service Contract that

          she's now willfully violating by

          acting in a Z-grade horror picture

          presently `shooting' in Griffith

          Park. Despite entreaties for her to

          cease participation in this

          absurdity, she continues to revel

          in her outlaw status with us. Thus

          we would like her destroyed.

                    ME

          What makes you think I can do a

          better job than your people?

                    MILTEER

          Mr. Bondurant says you're one of

          the smarter people he knows-

                     ME

          -dubious honor if you knew the

          other people Pete knows.

              (beat)

          So you want to catch her in

          violation of her Service Contract?

          Something like that?

                    MILTEER

          Exactly. The morality clause in

          particular as the damage to her

          reputation would be most

          devastating: Nymphomaniac,

          Criminal, Communist...anything

          along these lines. Once you visit

          the set of her `Attack of the

          Atomic Vampires,' you'll see the

          void that is her character. We

          haven't a photograph handy, but

          she's playing the lead female role.         *

                    ME

          I'm happy to help. But my price is

          $10,000. Not 5.

Pete laughs out loud. Milteer goes frigid.

                    MILTEER

          $10,000 should buy more than help.

                                                             45.

                         ME

               For 10 give it any name you want.

               I'm a salaried employee of LAPD,                      *

               that means I'll have to find time

               off hours to do this.

     A long, cold moment drags...                                    *

                         MILTEER

               Agreed. Start tonight. Someone's                      *

               been stealing groceries from our

               talent domiciles. There's no proof

               that it's her, but it's her. Peter

               will provide you addresses.

     Walk past a pair of beat Airstream Clippers. Watch her

     propping up this silver-haired junkie. She grabs a sound

     blanket, drapes him, hands him her coffee before siting down

     next to another Woman and rehearsing.

     Following the tail-lights of a 56 Corvette. Top-down,

     whipping Blond hair split-second visible under passing street

     lights. Glenda pulls into what I guess is her place: tiny-

     tidy Glendale flat. I roll past: no eye contact.

     Around the block. Park on the next street over. Waiting until

     I think of what comes next...get out now...

31   EXT. GLENDALE - NEXT MOMENT                               31

     Up to a fence. Scratch it: make sure a nuts-hungry Pooch

     isn't slobbering on the other side. Nothing. Vault the fence.

     Dodge a pool. Over another fence and into-

                                                             49.

     -creep to a window: curtains pulled. Creep to another: there

     she is. Watch her: elegant fingers emanate from hands only

     now beginning to betray age. Watch her shake her sandals off.

     Arranging three coffee cups on a tray: company coming.

     On cue: another car. A `53 Cadillac: the Director and Rock

     Rockwell. I crane my neck to get as much of her as I can. She

     leaves the tray, cups steaming. Muffled greetings. Check the

     window, open. Slide it up gentle.

                   (to the Director)

               Are you sure about this Sid? Seems

               shaky. Was this Mickey's idea?

                         DIRECTOR

               And I think it's brilliant!

               Inspired! The two leads of Mickey

               Cohen's magnum opus get kidnapped!

               The press'll eat it up! They'll

               write about `Gangster Mickey,' the

               glory days. Couple a' headlines

               like that and interest in Atomic

     Pat myself down for a pen, scribble on my hand: "A-I-N-G-E"

                         SID FRIZELL

               Is he okay with making it look real-

                         ROCKWELL

               -he can't hit me in the face!                         *

               That's a deal-breaker!

                         GLENDA BLEDSOE

               He'll be thrilled to knock me

               around. Plus he's holding something

               of mine, so we can kill two birds.

               He'll grab us Tuesday in front of

               I'm dying to know...was he the

               Spruce Goose between the sheets?

34   EXT. GLENDA'S BACKYARD - SAME MOMENT                      34

     My face folds up -- jealous-sour frown. I reach in, steal one   *

     of the steaming cups, bolt. Audible as I retreat:

                         GLENDA BLEDSOE (O.C.)

               Hung like a newborn and he called

               my tits `propellers.'

     Belly laughter from inside.

                         ME (V.O.)

               The real howler: fake kidnappings

               always bomb.

35   INT. MY 1955 PONTIAC - NIGHT                              35

     Parked. Tepid pulls off the stolen mug. Done. Toss it to the    *

     passenger side: lands on a bed of crumpled Styrofoam. Look

     up: the Magdalena residence looms a few doors down. Glance at

     the passenger seat: an envelope lined with fifty $100 bills.

     The name: BLEDSOE written across the front. Pick it up.

                                                             51.

                         ME (V.O.)

               Thinking I could tip Milteer off to

               the kidnap plot and pick up the

               other half of my payment...

                   (stare at that money)

               Thinking I should just give the

               first half back now...'cuz I know

               right now I'll never hurt her.

     Toss the envelope into the glove-box, slam it shut. Scan. Two

     heads in one of the unmarked patrol cars I ordered. Cursory

     nods as they pass. Tail-lights fade. Dead quiet save my low

     Jazz. Fighting my drift. Check my Hamilton. 10:00. Grimace.       *

                         ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)

               No sense of time. Exhaustion steals

               it. A full hour earlier than I told                     *

               Junior to meet me. I need sleep.                        *

     Yawn. Look up...Lucille Magdalena at her window. Sudden.          *

     Startling: no blouse, pig-tails, big silver-dollar nipples

     touch/steam glass. Pushes the curtains back even further.

     Adrenaline cuts through the lactic acid: wide awake now.

     I see her eyes aren't sex-placid or rolled back -- they're

     scanning -- hopeful to glimpse someone outside looking back.      *

                         ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)                            *

               This routine had been done before.

               That old broad babbling about a

               Peeper. The only other link to

               Hector Magdalena's disappearance.                       *

     She holds her scan for a blink, a different smile, eyes sex-

     placid now, rolled-back now -- she just saw what she was

     looking for: hidden eyes staring back at her. I look to where

     I saw her gaze kink...unholster my .45. Get out quiet.

36   EXT. 1284 SOUTH TREMAINE, NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT               36

     Cold for LA. Walking/scanning, .45 flush against my leg.

     Sticking to shadows. Cross the street: two homes down. Quiet

     steps. Closer: a snubbed cigarette smoulders in the gutter...

     Glance back up at the window, Lucille gone -- a forearm

     shiver flashes from nowhere blunts/blasts the back of my

     head. Nose-first into asphalt. Too angry to black out. Spit       *

     blood and scream at the same time so it sounds like drowning:

                         ME

               STOP-

                                                         52.

Still unsure what hit me. Pick-up my gun, clear my nose of

gouting blood, stand, weave: a figure in black, sprinting

away: PEEPER. Wipe away impact-tears, aim, realize my trigger   *

finger is dislocated -- bent back ugly. Tuck the gun use my     *

left hand to pop it back in -- deep growl -- re-aim:

POP-POP-POP. The Peeper pitches. Visible in the streetlight:

a red puff off his right shoulder. Headlights at end of the

block, behind me, come to life now- Baritone of a big V-8.      *

Peeper fighting for balance, keeps running.

I sprint heedless, round the corner: follow a blood-trail,

panting, bleeding my own trail. Lift my eyes to see the

Peeper shoulder through a fence, vanish into a backyard.

Neighborhood mutts yelp a chorus. I cross the street-

-those headlights swerve hard in front of me: Black Buick. I    *

look down in time to watch my knee detonate a quarter-panel.

I bounce off like someone yanked a leash. Crumble-yell. Hands

pick me up. I fight back before I even see at whom I'm

swinging: square-jawed types, eyes hidden by Bureau derbies.    *

Welles Noonan gets out of the passenger-side of the Buick.

Punches me as hard as he can without provocation: nothing to

write home about. My gun clatters to the ground.

                    WELLES NOONAN

          That's for Sanderline Johnson.

                    ME

              (nod at the Peeper trail)

          ARE YOU BLIND-

                    WELLES NOONAN

          -what were you firing at?

                    ME

          The only lead on Magdalena -- we're

          after the same guy you idiot!

                    WELLES NOONAN

              (to one of the goons)

          -write that name down: `Magda-LEE-

          na' or `Magda-LAY-na.'

              (back to me)

          No, we were after you. But thanks

          for the name.

Sag under the weight of my own insomnia-fed stupidity.          *

                                                               53.

                          ME (V.O.)

               Assumed the Feds were smart.

               Assumed they were ready to stick a

               new probe into the LAPD's deal with

               Hector, like Bradley warned, like

               everyone feared. But they had no                        *

               clue and I just handed them the

               whole God damn thing.

                   (beat)

               Like I said: I need sleep...

     Raise my face now, eyes intent, chin out.

                         ME (CONT'D)

               First punch you ever thrown Noonan?

               Your Mom have to teach you how

               because Dad was the same no-chin,

               Connecticut Faggot you are?

     Noonan stops, turns back to me: blazing.

                         ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)

               I think I hit the Noonan family

               dynamic, dead-on.

     He winds up an overhand right: a big-bright flash, then           *

     darkness that feels like lying down on a sunlit lawn.

     FLUTTERING BLACK:

                           WELLES NOONAN (O.C.)

               Drop him.

                         DERBY #1 (O.C.)

               You don't want to take him in?

                         WELLES NOONAN (O.C.)

               I only want to bring him in when I

               know he'll never leave.

     BLACK dissolves to something LIGHTER, then:

37   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - TIME UNKNOWN                       37

     Horizontal. Someone pushed a table and two chairs to one

     side: space for the cot I'm on. Look up. Junior looking

     down: `Concerned' isn't strong enough. In his undershirt. He

     slips the red steno pad into his back pocket. Sit up. A

     balled dress shirt in my hand, blood sopped.

     Gaze at my Hamilton, face cracked, `5:16am'-- Fritz Koenig

     walks in, silver pitcher in hand. I gape up, still punchy.

                                                        54.

                    ME

          Coffee?

                    KOENIG

          Ice. Bradley's on his way down.

Toss the dress shirt to the floor.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS

          That's mine...you needed some                        *

          mopping up.

                    ME

          Who found me?

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS

          I did. I got there at eleven like

          you said, right as two black &

          white's pulled up: you were out                      *

          cold in a gutter `round the block.                   *

              (this blithe little grin)

          Did Noonan knock you out?

                    ME

          He hit me with his car first.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS

              (a nod to Koenig)

          The Captain was the only one here

          at this hour...                                      *

Look from Junior and Koenig to the window behind him --

Bradley steam-rolling our way. To Koenig, conspiratorial:      *

                    KLEIN

          If I need your help later on, can I

          count on it?

                    KOENIG

          Of course you can.

Take the pitcher from him, drop my head, douse myself, the

cold cuts cobwebs. Bradley walks in, imperious. Koenig moves

past -- ice forms between the two.                             *

                    KOENIG (CONT'D)

          Chief.

                    BRADLEY

          What are you doing here?

                    KOENIG

          The Lieutenant was thirsty.

                                                           55.

Koenig closes the door. I refuse to look up at Bradley.

                    BRADLEY

          Progress on Magdalena.

I point to Junior -- happy to play teacher's pet:                *

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS

          No fingerprints. Clean crime scene.

          Canvassed the neighborhood. A

          senile neighbor did report a

          possible Peeper-

-rubbing the back of my head where the Peeper bashed me-

                    ME

          -confirmed Peeper.

Bradley turns to me:

                    BRADLEY

          Is that who knocked you out?

                    ME

          Noonan knocked me out.

                     BRADLEY

              (beat)

          He's having you tailed then...

                    ME

          And he knows the Magdalena name and

          that I was chasing a suspect -- the                    *

          Peeper Lucille strips for.                             *

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS

          She knows someone watches?

                    ME

          And who he is. She has to.

              (back to Bradley)

          I want access to her juvie sheet or                    *

          whatever arrest records exist.                         *

          Rumor was Hector whored her out to                     *

          dealers he did business with.                          *

                    BRADLEY

          That's immaterial.                                     *

                     ME                                          *

              (as my teeth grit)                                 *

          It is if you're eliminating her as                     *

          a suspect-                                             *

                                                        56.

                    BRADLEY                                    *

          -did you confirm their alibi?                        *

Point to the ever-studious Junior.                             *

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS                            *

          I spoke with a Mr. and Mrs. Preston                  *

          Mott of Santa Barbara, the parents                   *

          of Madge Magdalena nee Mott and                      *

          they've confirmed their visit and                    *

          also corroborated the argument that                  *

          resulted in them leaving early.                      *

                    BRADLEY                                    *

              (back to me now)                                 *

          One alteration to my previous

          orders-

                    ME                                         *

          -previous orders being what? Assign

          the Cop Noonan blames for his dead

          boxing probe to the case that's

          becoming his new crusade?                            *

Bradley conjures the Roman visage...then slowly opens the      *

door, staring holes in me.                                     *

                    BRADLEY                                    *

          Step out Stemmons.                                   *

Junior balks, looks my way: tries to mimic my sneer. I stand   *

and shove him toward the door. His look back at me: Judas.     *

Bradley closes the door behind him.                            *

                    BRADLEY (CONT'D)                           *

          No direct approach on the mother or                  *

          the daughter.                                        *

                    ME

          No. Madge was a battered wife and                    *

          Lucille was a suborned whore. If                     *

          that's not motive, what is? You                      *

          want answers then we brace those                     *

          two hard.

                    BRADLEY                                    *

          If you do so directly, if they're                    *

          formally questioned then Noonan may                  *

          find out and go after them with

          Federal warrants.

                                                    57.

                    ME

          Noonan will figure out who and what

          Hector was sooner or later.                     *

                    BRADLEY                               *

          Yes he will, so we buy time, keep

          him busy-

                    ME

          -until when?

                    BRADLEY

          Until Tom Bethune votes on the

          floor of the city council in two

          days, ratifying the official start

          of construction on Dodger stadium-

                    ME

          -this is bigger than a fucking

          ballpark! Hector Magdalena and

          Narco is the powder-keg, blows the              *

          whole Department to hell.                       *

                    BRADLEY

          Don't be dramatic, it looks weak.

          Right now, Noonan needs a pursuit,

          so I supply him with one-                       *

                    ME

          -me. You want me to draw him off-               *

                    BRADLEY

          -you've been drawing him off. And

          the more he sees you the less he'll

          think of anything other than

          getting you. Now find Tommy and                 *

          take him alive. Do not let Noonan               *

          get to him. As a potential major                *

          case witness against the LAPD,                  *

          Tommy Magdalena isn't just a powder-            *

          keg, he's an atom bomb.                         *

Bradley walks. Watch him disappear down the hall.

                    ME (V.O.)

          Bradley has a bigger angle and I'm

          getting close to it...I just

          haven't hit home. Yet.                          *

                                                                58.

38   INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY                                        38

     In a clean T-shirt from my locker. Heading toward Junior's

     desk. All eyes on my wounds. I toss Stemmons his shirt.

                         ME

               Seltzer will take the blood out.

     Junior bitchy, like some broad you stood up:

                         JUNIOR STEMMONS

               I give you the shirt off my back                        *

               and you bash me!                                        *

                         ME

               When a Superior Officer tells you

               to leave the room, you leave the                        *

               fucking room.                                           *

     Junior balls the shirt, stuffs it in his desk drawer. Takes a     *

     deep breath.                                                      *

                         JUNIOR STEMMONS

               I made a file on the Bledsoe broad.

               The one you asked about.

                         ME

               Thanks. But forget it.

                          JUNIOR STEMMONS

               I spent a whole day putting it

               together and this skirt's got

               skeletons.

     Reminded, glance at my hand: "A I N G E" in smeared ink.

     Junior rips open a file, blathers Bledsoe preliminaries:

                         JUNIOR STEMMONS (CONT'D)

               Shoplifting in Bakersfield at 17.

               Prostitution arrest at 21. Known

               associate of a Kern County homicide

               victim, this convicted pimp named

               Dwight Gillette, probably her pimp.

               Stabbed to death in his home,

               weapon never recovered-

                         ME

               Forget it. Burn it, s'not important

               now.

     Take the file from him, flip through; thorough, detailed.

     Glenda priors scream back instant conviction.

                                                               59.

                         JUNIOR STEMMONS

               Why is it not important?

     Plant the file in his chest as my answer.

                         ME

               I need an address on a guy named

               Ainge, George Ainge-                                    *

                         JUNIOR STEMMONS

               -what about Magdalena?

     My temper turning threadbare.

                         ME

               -after you get the Ainge address,                       *

               get back to the Magda-

                         JUNIOR STEMMONS

                   (picks up Glenda's file)

               -is Ainge related to this Cunt?

     Snap-grit-grab him: buttons from his shirt pop, bounce.

                         ME

               We're partners in name only. You

               want to stay in the room next time,

               Junior? Do something to impress me:

               like finding that address.

     Dig Junior trying to hide tears now behind that mad-dog

     glare: makes me want to break the bones in his face.

39   INT. MY 1955 PONTIAC - MORNING                               39

     Driving, running parallels to avoid Fed tails. No Black

     Buicks...But a Gray Packard shifts behind me on a cadence.        *

                         ME (V.O.)

               Noonan replaced the Buick with a                        *

               Packard and a better Shadow-Man.                        *

               But I could still spot the tail.                        *

     Run a red light at Rossmore, leave the Packard behind.            *

                         ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)

               This jet-engine urge to see her.

               Needing it like a junkie does. No

               logic. Just the push.

                                                          60.

Driving past Glenda's house now. No Corvette. Driving past      *

the Griffith Park `Vampires' set: addicts/crew rolling up

sleeping bags. No Corvette. Pull the address list Dandy

handed me: Talent Domiciles.

Pasadena. Howard's Fuck-Pad supreme: A tudor mansion with

airplane-shaped hedges. A Corvette in the drive. Stop at the

curb. Open shades. Flashes of her. Gathering something. Check

my Hamilton, look up as: KNOCK-KNOCK on my window. Her face,

inches-close. Bags of groceries in her hands and this wry

little smile: watch me kill Hughes's new Dick with kindness.    *

Roll the window down, stay blank-slate. She features my

cuts/bruises. Her quiet, deep voice is like medicine:

                    GLENDA BLEDSOE

          Better looking than the last guy

          Howard hired. Once you heal.

              (she recognizes me)

          Wait a minute. You were there, the

          other night, the Bethune Party...                     *

My heart jammed up into my throat. Push past it.                *

          Yeah.                                                 *

          everybody used to call-

              (mocking, I love it:)

          -`The Enforcer' was asking about

          me. Told me to be careful. So

          you're LAPD after all...

          In theory.

          Those Howard's?

          Better than a billionaire does?

          Go make amends and finish out your

          service contract Ms. Bledsoe.

                    GLENDA BLEDSOE

          Not if there was just one day left

          on it.

                    ME

          Why?

                    GLENDA BLEDSOE

          I'm better than that.

                    ME

          You're also better than a starring

          role in schlock horror flick

          that'll never see a screen,

Drop that coffee cup from the other night into her bag. She's

beat, but bluffs by.

          This isn't the first time you've

          spied on me.

               And tell Howard I'll take my

42   INT. DINER - DAY                                          42

     Back booth with a view of the street. Bido Lito's across the

     way. Eyeball the entrance and adjoining alley. On the table

     in front of me, mugshots: known Tommy Magdalena associates.     *

     Mostly greaser kids with low-rent juvie sheets.                 *

     Stare at that photo of Tommy.

                          ME (V.O.)

                Stakeout work. Browse mugs. Match a

                face out front if I get lucky. Wait

     9:20 PM. Bito Crowd bops out front. Valet ballet.               *

     Scanning...spot a face...pull my mugshots...Steve Wenzel,       *

     Okie white-trash from El Monte, shoving his way through the

     crush out in front of the club, hits the side alley.

     I'm up. Dump a pocketful of coins on the table. Hit the door.

44   EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS                                  44

     Cross fast, play the wall and the shadows close. Watch as

     Wenzel climbs steps to a flop overtop of the club. Get deeper

     into the alley: a padlocked two-car overhang at the rear.

     Grip my .45, stock down, swing, split the lock. Chain spools

     at my feet, slide inside the overhang...a car concealed under

     a tarpaulin, peel it off slow...revealing a red `32 Ford.       *

                          ME (V.O.)                                  *

45   INT. SECOND FLOOR FLOP - CONTINUOUS                          45

     Jimmy the door,   slide inside silent. Muffled sounds through

     the floor, some   jazz combo wailing away at Bido Lito's below.

     Voices down the   hall, male, laughter, goofball guffaws.

     George Gobel on   the tube: `Well, I'll be a dirty bird!

     Creep in a crouch, my .45 at the hip, safety off. Move toward

     the flicker at the far end of the hall. Sounds of pissing         *

     nearby, ease around a doorjamb .45 first: bedroom barren,

     dust-caked mattress, a half dozen bottles of Old Crow lie

     scattered among sash cords & used heroin spikes.

     Light from the bathroom...a pair of legs visible, female.

     Dark but pale, splayed from inside the bathroom...the right

     foot slowly moves back and forth like the heel is trying to

     gain some purchase on fast-draining life. Somebody flushes,

     zips up, steps over the two legs.

     Duck back into the hall as this Greaser stinking of pomade

     wafts past, weaving back toward the TV room.

46   INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS                                    46

     Inside. Move fast now. A fist-sized lump swells mid-chest,

     blossoms into my throat. I don't want to see what I know is

     there. Turn the corner:

     Club Alabam songbird Tilly Hopwell. Three breaths from death.

     A spike snapped off in her greyish, motionless left arm. Her

     right hand claws at tile. These beautiful dark eyes stare up

     at me like she was hoping for someone sooner. Throttle marks

     on her neck, one breast exposed, bra pulled down for a grope.

     I don't want to touch her face but I do...she closes her eyes

     the moment my fingertips hit. That gases my hate. Choke back

     sudden tears.

                         VOICE BEHIND ME

               FUCK YOU DOIN'?

     Turn back. GREASER in the doorway, brown-bagged T-Bird hits

     the floor as he reaches for his waist -- stand and shoot him

     in the throat. Drive the .45 into his sternum like a blade

     before I fire the second-third-fourth shots. He falls/flails.     *

     Jump-shock from the other room.                                   *

                                                                66.

                         ME                                            *

               POLICE!                                                 *

     Bodies scramble. No words. Just Pistol fire through the half-     *

     rotted walls -- punks taking potshots. No compliance means I      *

     hit the hallway shooting back. Firing dead-bang at a couple       *

     fleeing silhouettes -- see them pop-stumble-fall-                 *

     -the archway above my head shreds, collapses. Somebody firing

     a sub-machine gun. Flat on my ass, my back finds the wall,        *

     cough up plaster, sleeve my eyes to see. Then quiet, save the     *

     rattle-clap of changing clips.                                    *

                         ME                                            *

               PUT THAT GOD DAMN GUN DOW-                              *

                         TOMMY MAGDALENA (O.C.)

               -YOU SET ME UP YOU COCKSUCKER!

     Machine-gun fire lights up my left side. Roll. Taste floor        *

     grime as subsonic zips snap close...bullets miss by inches.       *

                         TOMMY MAGDALENA

               -RAT FUCK COP! YOU KILLED HIM                           *

               WILHITE!

     Every part of me pauses...`Wilhite'...back door gets blunted

     open, frantic footfalls recede. That big bent V-8 on Tommy's

     `32 Deuce roars to life. Up now, plow through the cloud of

     cordite. See one of Tommy's Pachucos propped up against the       *

     wall, unhit, unhurt. Point my .45 and pull the trigger a I        *

     pass. Hit an empty chamber...this punk's lucky day.

47   EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS                                      47

     Out the door reloading as the `32 Deuce barrels away. Tommy

     fires shots into the air to clear traffic. Wenzel in the          *

     passenger seat, screams to do the same. The Driver's side rim     *

     sparks fireworks.                                                 *

     Pandemonium out in front of Bido Lito's as the crowd

     stampedes ass-over-elbows. Sprint to my car, inside, key          *

     dispatch fast as I wheel rough off the curb:                      *

                         ME

               Shots fired, 1600 block of Ivar.                        *

               Suspect fleeing scene in red `32                        *

               Ford Deuce travelling westbound on                      *

               Wilcox, vehicle impaired, intercept                     *

     -horns blare as I slalom club-goers scrambling across Ivar.

     Punch it over-top Sunset, parallel to the Deuce. Rip a left       *

     on Selma. Stay on my radio:

                         ME

               -and I need an ambulance to respond

               to 1607 North Ivar, second floor,

               female negro, possible overdose.

     Up ahead I catch a fireworks show: the Deuce gouges pavement      *

     across the 4-way. Clip 90 MPH catching up. Squeal onto Wilcox     *

     as Tommy hooks a right onto Hollywood.                            *

     Two prowlers pass the next second, sirens lit, full scream.       *

48   EXT. HOLLYWOOD AND VINE - CONTINUOUS                         48

     Haul ass up to Hollywood, round it: See Tommy and Wenzel

     sitting upright, the Deuce spun sidelong, firing M3 `Grease

     Guns' into the approaching prowlers. Both cars go helter-

     skelter under fire. Six-packs spill to the street, belly          *

     crawl, brandish .38 service snubs and pop flimsy return fire.

     Tommy jumps down, runs, rifling his jacket for clips. Wenzel

     stays atop the car -- gun my engine, split the abandoned          *

     prowlers. Wenzel looks up mid-reload as I T-bone the `Deuce'      *

     at speed. The impact rockets him rag-doll end over end before     *

     he bombs back down to the street, wet sack, multiple

     bruises/fractures/breaks...blood pooling in pints.

     Tommy wide-eyes the heap that was Wenzel. Kick my driver's        *

     side door open firing. Tommy cuts loose with that Grease-Gun,     *

     sprays wild. Crouch-move as bullets thump wreckage and whiz

     by overhead. More sirens approach. Tuck behind the front end

     of the mangled `Deuce.'

     Another salvo from the Grease-Gun skips up off the pavement       *

     in front of me. The six-packs have regrouped, start laying        *

     down fire on Tommy. Tommy running now -- I'm up on one knee,      *

     aiming, tucking into the .45: take his legs but don't kill h-     *

     -that Gray Packard materializes across the intersection in

     front of Tommy: shotgun blasts from the driver's side             *

     backseat obliterates Tommy's mid-section.                         *

     My mouth gapes at what just happened...then I remember to         *

     fire at the Packard as it continues down the street, running      *

     lights extinguished, no plates visible.

     Get to Tommy. Crying. Fading. Roll him on his back.               *

                                                             68.

                         ME (CONT'D)                                 *

               Where's your father!? Did Wilhite                     *

               kill him!?- TELL ME!

     -bubbling blood in place of words. Mouth moves like a           *

     grouper's...get close...his last gasp...pray it's profound.     *

     He breathes out...nothing.                                      *

49   INT. MY 1955 PONTIAC - NIGHT                              49    *

     Driving. Pissed. Radiator steam from under my crunched hood.    *

                         ME (V.O.)                                   *

               That Gray Packard: not the Feds.                      *

               Make them Magdalena rivals. I left                    *

               Bido Lito's too fast to catch a                       *

               tail. So where did they come from?                    *

50   EXT. 1284 SOUTH TREMAINE - DAY                            50

     Magdalena home. Pull up onto the front lawn. Grab my brass      *

     knucks from the glove box. Out of my car. Growling. A pair of   *

     Narco brims, Wilhite's boys, break wide on my approach.         *

     Junior stumbles from the stakeout car, rushing up the street

     toward me.

     with more booze and pills...word of Tommy's demise has          *

     reached her.                                                    *

52   INT. LUCILLE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS                       52

     Wilhite and Lucille in the middle of some close conversation.

Grab Lucille's bruised arms. Wilhite grabs me in return. Hear   *

footfalls coming hard up the steps, Wilhite reinforcements.     *

Wilhite tries to push past. Gut-punch him hard, trying to     *

rupture something. Shove him back into the wall. Drywall

implodes. He squeals/shrieks, seizes his shoulder.            *

               she's a pro! What is she paying to                      *

               get that blade back-                                    *

                                                           76.

-get the gun in his face, burn his nose with the barrel.         *

                    ME                                           *

          What? What `blade?'                                    *

                     GEORGE AINGE                                *

          What's she paying you to recover                       *

          her knife?

Just then Junior banana peels it -- deliberately:                *

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS                              *

          Lieutenant!                                            *

A hate-scowl for Junior: trying to put enough heat behind it     *

to melt his head. Ainge lights up.                               *

                    GEORGE AINGE                                 *

          Y'all are Cops!?                                       *

                    ME                                           *

          Shut your mouth.                                       *

Ainge sees me bent on Glenda. Looks past me, past the gun in     *

his face, aims right at Junior.                                  *

                    GEORGE AINGE                                 *

          Back in `50, Glenda the Good Witch                     *

          put a blade in her pimp `bout as                       *

          deep as I put my pink in her, this                     *

          mongrel named Dwight Gillette.                         *

Junior fixes me, pulls that steno, starts scribbling openly -- *

I grab it, shred it. Ainge grins at the voodoo between us.     *

                    GEORGE AINGE (CONT'D)                        *

          Could use a couple LAPD favors, and                    *

          ain't guttin' a pimp still a crime?                    *

                    GEORGE AINGE                                 *

          Guess who she asked to hold the                        *

          knife? Guess why she brought me in                     *

          on this kidnap thing? It was her                       *

          way a' buying it back-                                 *

          -show it to me.                                        *

          I'll have my lawyer take a picture                     *

          of it for you-                                         *

-throw his TV at his head: legitimately trying to kill him       *

now and he knows it. Off his chair, crawling.                    *

                     JUNIOR STEMMONS                             *

          STOP!                                                  *

              (more question than                                *

                statement)                                       *

          YOU ARE NOT BENT ON AN EX-WHORE!                       *

I grab the shattered tube: throw it again. Big POP inches        *

from Ainge. Angry at myself for missing twice:                   *

                    ME                                           *

          GOD DAMN IT-                                           *

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS                              *

          -HE'S A MATERIAL WITNESS TO A MURD-                    *

-grab Junior, sharp jab him, push him out a door for the         *

second time-                                                     *

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS (CONT'D)                     *

          -YOU WILL CEASE AND DESIST KLEIN-                      *

-final push with my foot gives me enough room to dead-bolt it    *

behind him. Ainge can't fit under his bed.                       *

                    GEORGE AINGE                                 *

          I AIN'T RESISTING YOU!                                 *

                    ME                                           *

          I'm not arresting you.                                 *

Flip the mattress. Teen Tit mags and jack-off socks fly with     *

it. Ainge under pine slats. Panic. I put my foot through,        *

bash his gut -- rip him out from underneath.                     *

                    ME (CONT'D)                                  *

              (hissing)                                          *

          Where is it?                                           *

Ainge unable to speak, gasping for air. Step to his closet:      *

shred hinges when I open it. Rip the clothes rod down:           *

nothing. Pull shelves from the wall: a Louisville Slugger        *

falls at my feet. I smile. Ainge goes frightwig. Step to him.    *

                    ME (CONT'D)                                  *

          WHERE?!                                                *

                                                               78.

     Swing it into a wall. Gaping holes in holster. Bring it back

     like Babe Ruth over his head.

                         ME (CONT'D)                                  *

               -that blade or your life.                              *

     Door bashed open behind me -- deadbolt assembly pops, pieces     *

     hit me -- then something big/black-metallic ends my night:       *

     Junior, tear-streaked cheeks, Ainge's mailbox in-hand, pulled    *

     free from the stucco. I drop. Ainge turns cheerleader:           *

                         GEORGE AINGE                                 *

               NICE!                                                  *

     Roll to my knees: guttural groans I can't place   because        *

     they're mine. Junior rips a radio cord from the   wall, wraps    *

     it around my neck, pulls my head back, feel his   tears hit my   *

     shoulders. Veins in his arms go Pop. Eyes in my   head go Pop.   *

                         JUNIOR STEMMONS                              *

               Last time you push me out a door!                      *

               For a dirty split-tail! You're-                        *

                   (cinches hard)

               -not dragging me down! If Bradley

               doesn't get you, Noonan will! And-

                   (through gritted-teeth)                            *

               -you're gonna burn all by yourself!

     -go black. Then eyes open...out for hours/days/months...what?    *

     Feel. Hangman's bruise forming around my neck. Junior and        *

     Ainge gone. Floorboards under Ainge's bed pried-up. Crawl to     *

     the hole: a hiding spot, empty of whatever was in it.            *

                         ME (V.O.)                                    *

               Call it: the knife was here. Ainge                     *

               was crawling under his bed not to                      *

               escape me, but to hand it over. Too                    *

               hate-wired to see it.                                  *

     I check my watch: 11 PM.                                         *

                         ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)                           *

               Junior the Player. Junior the                          *

               Underestimated. Junior the Former                      *

               Evidence Teacher: a murder weapon,                     *

               a witness, a two-hour head-start.                      *

57   EXT. AINGE'S PLACE - NEXT MOMENT                            57   *

     Few looks from few neighbors. No sirens. Thank God gunshots      *

     and screams are school-nights in this slum. Get into my car.     *

     Nobody around this late. Only a desk sergeant on the doze.      *

     Zero-in on Junior's desk, search it: files squared, pencils     *

     in precise alignment, evidence books arrayed alphabetically.    *

                         ME (V.O.)                                   *

     Rip at a locked return, jimmy the desk drawers, feel the        *

     underside for a key -- zilch. Slide under, looking...nothing.   *

Hang up. Voices arrive. Hustle to my desk, sit, grab a         *

reverse directory, fake flip through it as Fritz Koenig and    *

two Robbery Blueshirts arrive, seizure bags over their         *

     Put the car into `park.' Idle. She looks over, her eyes           *

     asking something. I hold her gaze, hesitate, then:                *

                         ME (CONT'D)                                   *

               Nothing's going to happen to you...                     *

     She frets with her hair, her eyes glassy.                         *

               I'm not gonna let it.                                   *

     A beat...I want to grab her and kiss her. I convince myself       *

     otherwise, grab a card from my coat and a pen, scrawl.            *

               This is my sister's number. Name is                     *

               Meg. Call if there are problems.                        *

63   INT. MY CAR - NIGHT                                          63

     Driving. Blood-shot. Slowly being squeezed on all sides.

                         ME (V.O.)

               Looking for leverage. Figure out

               Bradley's angle before I fry.

               Madge and Lucille in custody. No

               Hector and no Tommy equals No

               leads. Save one.

                                                             86.

64   EXT. SANTA MONICA HOTEL - EARLY A.M.                      64    *

     Slouched in my front seat, watching a small flop-style motel    *

     near the beach.

                          ME (V.O.)

               Dan Wilhite.

                   (beat)

               Dispatch shot me his temporary

               address. Some beach flop he fled to

               after his wife put him out.

     Check my Hamilton: 7:32 AM. A car pulls into the parking lot.

     Two suits step out, ramrod straight, starched officious:

     Process Servers if ever I've seen them. One of them bears a

     sealed envelope as they walk to room #11 and knock. No

     answer. They knock rude. I roll down my window.

     Dan Wilhite answers in a robe: Groggy-pissed-hungover. Before

     he utters a word, he's handed the sealed envelope and the

     pair depart. Wilhite calls after, tearing open the envelope

     and reading what's inside...then rereading it.

     Gauge his reaction: ruined.

     He puts his hand on top of his head...like he's trying to

     protect it from the sky that is now falling down around him.

     Another big pause staring at nothing...then he just calmly

     walks back inside the room, closing the door behind him.

65   EXT. SANTA MONICA HOTEL - NEXT MOMENT                     65

     Out of my car. Quietly hustling up to Wilhite's door: Reach

     it and hear a distinct POP -- see the flash-snap from behind

     the curtains: Gunshot. I know what it is. Hit the door.

66   INT. WILHITE'S ROOM - NEXT MOMENT                         66

     Wilhite's service revolver a foot away from one hand, a sheet

     of paper still gripped in the other. Body half onto the bed,

     half off. Blood drains from a round wound in his temple.

     Check behind me, nobody coming- close the hotel door. Pick up

     the sheet of paper/contents of the envelope. The first word I

     see: SUBPOENA.

                         ME (V.O.)

               My first thought, pure panic:

               Noonan figured the Narco-Magalena

               connection.

                                                              87.

     Flip the Subpoena over to see his Signature: not Noonan's.

     This subpoena has been issued and signed by LA District

     Attorney Bob Gallaudet. Flip it back over, wide-eyed:

                          ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)

               But it wasn't a Federal Subpoena.

               Wilhite was being called to testify

               by Bob Gallaudet, a man who doesn't

               piss without Bradley's say-so.

                   (beat)

               Bradley trying to beat Noonan to

               the punch and burn the LAPD

               himself...why?

67   EXT. PARKING LOT - LATER                                      67

     A quick check of the lot. Empty. A housekeeping cart sits

     nearby. Swipe a bottle of bleach from it. Walk to Wilhite's

     Studebaker Powerhawk. Pop the trunk, return to his room.

     Move quick. Fireman's carry, dump Wilhite's body in the

     trunk. Toss his service .38 too. Pour the bottle of bleach to

     stanch the inevitable rot smell.

                         ME (V.O.)

               Swap my car for Wilhite's. The

               former head of the LAPD's Narcotics

               division dead in the trunk. Call it

               the leverage I was looking for --

               his body can buy me out of bad spot-

     -and that's when I see it: a bandage poking out from under         *

     Wilhite's collar...undo a couple buttons, lift the bandage.        *

                                                      FLASH TO:

68   EXT. 1284 SOUTH TREMAINE - NIGHT                              68   *

     BAM: me hit from behind by the Peeper. BAM: me firing at the       *

     Peeper. Hit him in the left shoulder. BAM: Grabbing Wilhite's      *

     shoulder in the Magdalena bathroom, him howling in pain.           *

                                                      RETURN TO:        *

69   INT. WILHITE'S GARAGE - NEXT MOMENT                           69   *

     The kind of wound a grazed bullet leaves.                          *

                                                              88.

                         ME (V.O.)                                    *

               Wilhite was the Peeper. Bent on                        *

               Lucille, a girl younger than his                       *

               youngest daughter. Call it grounds

               for divorce...Call Wilhite Hector

               Magdalena's murderer...

     Slam the trunk as Wilhite's glazed eyes stare back at me.

70   EXT. STREET - A.M.                                          70   *

     Slow cruise, new ride means no tails. Check my mirrors           *

     anyway. Back to the pad, back-streets all the way.               *

71   INT. MY HOME, HOLLYWOOD HILLS - A.M.                        71   *

     Rounding the corner -- break hard: those same process servers

     leaning on my doorbell now.

                         ME

               Bradley trying to bury me too. That

               subpoena means my fifteen year

               career with the LAPD just went up

               in smoke.

     Continue past. Those Process Geeks keep buzzing my doorbell.

72   INT. BREAKFAST JOINT PAY-PHONE - MORNING                    72

     Drop dimes. Dial Pete.

                          ME

               Hey-

                         PETE (O.S.)

               -Junior's left the fucking planet.

                         ME

               You find him?

                         PETE

               Yeah. I swung by his apartment, car

               was out front. I scoped it: a sawed-

               off shotgun in front, canned tuna

               in the back seat. Think he's living

               outta that car. After he left, I

               tried to get inside his place: The

               front door is triple pad-locked.

                                                             89.

                         ME

                   (out loud)

               That knife is in there-

                            PETE

               -the what?

     Shit. Ignore it, maybe Pete will too.

                         ME

               Meet me down the street from his

               place. You got bolt cutters?

                         PETE

               I'll bring `em.

                         ME

               Thirty minutes.

73   EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY                              73

     Junior's stucco-beige apartment building looms a block up.

     Cursory checks of the rear and side-view mirrors. Sans tail

     as I pull the Powerhawk in behind Pete's Caddy. Step out,

     sidle up driver's side.

                         PETE

               Who's car is that?

                         ME

               Long story.

                         PETE

               Junior looked real skeezed this

               morning. Like he was on a dope jag.

                            ME

               Yeah?

                         PETE

               Sweated up like a stuck pig. And be

               careful. He was fucking around with

               his front door before he left. I

               don't know what he was doing.

                         ME

               Two honks if he shows. Then meet me

               in the alley, back of his place.

                                                             90.

                         PETE

                   (handing me bolt-cutters)

               What about this Bledsoe broad?

               Milteer has called me twice.

                         ME

                   (taking the bolt-cutters)

               One thing at a time pal.

74   EXT. JUNIOR'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY                    74

     Hustle across the street. Hang my badge over my shirt-pocket.

75   INT. JUNIOR'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER          75

     Up three flights. Junior: #303: three padlocks:hinge/receiver

     hardware extending between door and jamb. Three kicks and a

     shoulder to splinter the door. Stop, look: Some kind of twine

     stretched taut, just inside the door...trip-wire. Pull my pig-

     sticker, extend it between door and jamb...see the twine

     stretching tighter -- flick the blade, snag twine, slice it.

     Stand. Put my boot into the door full. Snaps at the hinges.

76   INT. APT. 303 - NEXT MOMENT                               76

     Move slow. Examine close: Eye-bolt pulley system, jerry-

     rigged around the door. Severed twine attached to the trigger

     of a shotgun taped atop a jello mold at knee level.

     Continue to look around. Sex-horror grimace: like catching

     Pop fingering Mom. Junior's place a tiny, filthy one bedroom.

                         ME (V.O.)

               Junior the Insane: You couldn't

               hide what he was hiding in 1958 LA,

               and not have it rot your mind.

     Bear traps barely hidden under sheets. Rat-traps garnished

     with razor blades across the floor. Smell rotten flowers: his

     shirt that I wore/bled-on crumpled on his pillow -- yellowed

     jizz stains cover black blood stains. Stifle a gag.

     Card table: an empty green-banded evidence bag. Gape at it.

     Then walk over, read the abstracts: 1284 South Tremaine.

                         ME (V.O.)

               Junior stealing evidence from the

               Magdalena crime scene.

                                                                      91.

Then I see the bookcase. Top shelf: Police manuals. Bottom

two shelves: wall-to-wall red steno-pads, all exactly the

same brand. Shock. Step over. Flip through them: tiny,

architect-neat script covers every page. The running dialogue

of a functional fucking freak:

MAGDALENA RESIDENCE. 1284 S. TREMAINE. RECOVERED: MAGDALENA FINANCIAL

RECORDS/LEDGERS. SOME ENTRIES REDACTED. TRANSLATED `HH' INTO

`HURWITZ HOLDINGS' AFTER RECOVERING MAIL. SEEMS SUSPICIOUS. BROUGHT

TO ATTENTION OF KLEIN. BRUSHED OFF. PRESS IN SPITE OF KLEIN'S LAZINESS OR

LACK OF INTEREST.

A hand drawn cock doodled beneath that, then below:

DAVE WEARING FORM-FITTING SHIRT TODAY. HANDSOME. I WANT TO PULL IT-

-drop the steno like it might bite. Pick up another: same

drill.

WELLES NOONAN WILL WIN OUT. KLEIN NOT SKILLED OR SMART ENOUGH TO

DUEL WITH A U.S. ATTORNEY MUCH LESS THE FBI. DEEP ADMIRATION FOR

NOONAN'S CAUSE. HIS PURPOSE IS PURE. DON'T WANT TO GET DRAGGED DOWN

WITH POISON PILL KLEIN. MAKE HIM PAY FOR PATRONIZING ME.

Pick up yet another, hands shaking, turn to the last page:

MAKE KLEIN HURT LIKE I HURT. TRADE HIM. TRADE EVERYTHING. TRADE UP TO

THE BUREAU. THINK OF IT: AGENT RICHARD STEMMONS JR. PROUD-PROUD. 1

DREAM DOWN, 10,000 TO GO!

                      ME (V.O.)

            Junior the Climber, trading me up

            to Noonan. Thinks bootlicking will

            buy him a Bureau gig.

Now, rifle for that knife. Systemically destroy the place.

Dump the stenos in a trash can, sift for matches, strike,

watch the pads catch and floosh, feed the fire with random

paperwork, sift -- Junior's cock-obsessed doodles scribbled

by the dozen.

Under the bed now, carpet covered in rat-traps. Spring them,

clear a space. A Box: beefcake booty, gay smut mags, gay

classified ads. First-person perspective Polaroids of

Junior's stomach being kissed by the Diskant Quiff and vice-

versa.

Open a massive steamer trunk against a far wall. Arsenal:

handguns, shotguns, a surplus M-1. Dump it, kick contents.

Only interested in that knife.

                                                             92.

     Move into his kitchenette. Check the freezer even though

     Junior is smarter than that: amyl-nitrate poppers, vodka,

     benzedrine, cocaine. Close it. Look down. STOP: indents in

     the cheap tile floor from where the refrigerator used to sit.

     Pull to see what's behind. Eyes catch the bear-trap near the

     bed as I tug: ugly-rusted-waiting. STOP part II: Contort,

     peer behind the refrigerator: a pineapple-shaped hand grenade

     duct-taped to the wall, next to a built-in safe.

                         MY NARRATOR VOICE (V.O.)

               The safe scared me more than all of

               it because a safe doesn't get

               installed overnight...he'd been

               working on something, planning

               something...

     Twine leads from the grenade's pin to the back of the

     refrigerator. My bolt-cutters snap it. Pull the refrigerator

     out now. The safe bolted into the drywall. Stare at it: the

     dial, the black paint-job...

                                                       CUT TO:

     Loading shells into the shotgun that was atop that jello

     mold. Back into the kitchen. Exhale. BEGIN BLASTING. Massive

     noise. Six shots. Reload fast: nothing can muffle this

     clatter. SECOND VOLLEY. Eyes closed to keep chunks of drywall

     out. Gagging on gunsmoke. Rip at the safe -- something gives.

     THIRD VOLLEY. The Safe hits the floor, leaves a hole.

     Through the ringing in my ears: something that sounds like

     honks. Quick peek: Pete gone. A Black Buick with two white-

     walled FEDS up front. Then Junior gets out of the backseat...

     Scoop the freezer drugs, the stack of man-porn, the

     snapshots, and toss a whole armful into the hallway in front

     of Junior's door. Grab the green-banded evidence bag and tuck

     it under my arm. Back into the kitchenette. Turn on the gas

     but don't light the burners. Pull the grenade off the wall.

     Drag the safe to the rear of his place: the fire escape.

77   EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - NEXT MOMENT                              77

     Out the window, on the escape, toss the evidence-bag down to

     Pete, then push the safe over the railing. Feature it almost

     crush the back of Pete's idling Cadillac. Pete jumps, yells:

                          PETE

               Asshole!

                                                             93.

                         ME

               Get it open if you can and meet me

               back at Meg's!

     Doesn't move until I pull the pin on the pineapple, drop the

     pin down on him. He jumps back in, peels off-

78   INT. JUNIOR'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NEXT MOMENT               78

     -Junior on the second-floor landing, heading to his place.

     Bloodshot bleary wide eyes, spun on a combo of drugs, the

     Feds herding him like a rabid dog:

                         JUNIOR STEMMONS

               Stay right here. I'll get it all

               and come back. Don't move.

79   EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - SAME MOMENT                               79

     Ricochet the grenade back into the kitchen. Leap down half a

     flight: put exterior brick between my head and the-

     -BIG BOOM -- the grenade goes off.

80   INT. JUNIOR'S APARTMENT BUILDING - SAME MOMENT               80

     Junior knocked on his ass halfway up the last flight. Feds

     come sprinting. Screaming Junior tackles one on the way up.

     Juniors' front-door blown off. Terrified Neighbors greeted

     with images of Sodom scattered from the explosion: drugs,

     mags, dildos. The Fed that didn't get tackled picks up a

     photo: Junior kissing a hairy stomach.

     And Junior's mind snaps cleanly in-half. Crawls away growling

     like a bear caught in one of his traps.

81   EXT. ALLEY - NEXT MOMENT                                     81

     I step calm. Clear the alley slow. Don't let your stride give

     you away. Another Black Buick arrives. More Bureau stiffs.

     Keep moving. Looky-Loos pop up along the block, pointing. I'm

     the only one not looking back toward Junior's now flaming

     pad. The Powerhawk still another street up. Fire engines wail

     close.

     Shouts from behind now. Look back: a Bureau putz pointing my

     way -- one of the Buicks tearing up the block toward me.

                                                             94.

                         ME (V.O.)

               Call it. Keep going and give up

               Wilhite's car and the corpse

               inside, or lay back and deal with

               Noonan's Buzzcuts.

     Lace my fingers behind my head, turn to face them -- catch a

     form tackle from this geeked up junior G-Man diving from the

     Buick, drives his shoulder and takes me down sprawling.

82   INT. L.A. FEDERAL BUILDING - LATER                        82

     Welles Noonan staring. He picks nipped/mutilated fingernails.

               Civil servants can't afford

               Breaking and entering, theft, and

               willful destruction of private

               property...and I'll add attempted

               murder to the current first degree

               murder charge I'm about to file

               against you.

                         ME

               Proof. If you had it, you wouldn't

               be fucking around with shitty

               shakedown routine -- you'd file.

               Coercion equals confession. So

               let's see you pound it out of me.

                         WELLES NOONAN

               Where are the files you stole from

               Sergeant Richard Stemmons.

                         ME

               Junior. Your secret weapon right? I

               mean, I know J. Edgar is a slanted

               fuck, but traditionally `vicious

               fags' don't make the best major

               case witnesses.

                   (beat, keep pushing)

               I'm worried those burning dildos

               may have damaged his credibility.

                         WELLES NOONAN

               Oh I don't need his testimony

               Klein. I'll just force yours.

Not if you had the next hundred

years.

          WELLES NOONAN

Sanderline Johnson, your links to

Sam Giancana to Mickey Cohen,

extortion, bribes, murder-for-hire.

I'll put you in every pair of cross-

hairs I can find. I'll torch

everything you've ever touched. You

have no idea how deep I run Klein.

And how far I'm willing to go to

fuck you-

          ME

-everyone knows I'm a piece-a-shit.

What are you proving? Bradley's the

guy flanking you right now. The guy

who's vulnerable right now.

          WELLES NOONAN

You're all angles and graft Klein.

Why trust a God damn word that

comes out of your-

          ME

-you done anything with the

Magdalena case?

          WELLES NOONAN

    (thrown)

-Dealing drugs for 20 years!

Arrested once. Hall a' fame career!

You photographed the head of Narco

in-front of his house...

          WELLES NOONAN

AND?

          ME

Jesus Christ, you need cue cards?

    (sell this fucker now)

Come after me: you get me. Go after

what I can give you and you get the

LAPD's power-set on a slab.

                                                          96.

                    WELLES NOONAN

          I don't believe you'd turn.

          Treacherous yes, traitorous no.

          Tell me where Stemmons' files are.

                    ME

          I'll bring them to you.

                    WELLES NOONAN

          You're not leaving here Klein.

                    ME

          Then like I said: you only get me.

Noonan stands, firm:

                    WELLES NOONAN

          I'll take it.

On his way out I speak fast -- the last ace in my deck:

                    ME

          I give you the body of Dan Wilhite,

          head of LAPD's Narcotics Division.

          Proof of a 20-year criminal

          collusion between his department

          and Hector Magdalena and my

          testimony to link the dots.

              (beat, make him believe)

          Then I leave LA for good.

Noonan at the door: please bite-please bite...but he just

smirks, walks out. Real panic now: no ideas on what comes

next. 15 seconds. Door opens again: one of Noonan's deputies

pushes a sheet. Scan it: Federal Witness Agreement. Noonan

back: two cups of coffee. Read it over.

                    WELLES NOONAN

          What happened to Wilhite?

                       ME

          Suicide.

                    WELLES NOONAN

          Like Sanderline Johnson?

Ignore him. Sign the agreement.

                    WELLES NOONAN (CONT'D)

          Get me Stemmons files and Wilhite's

          body by noon tomorrow.

Gulp the coffee back, the burn feels good.

                                                             97.

                         ME

               No more tails. I don't want anyone

               else incriminated.

                           WELLES NOONAN

               Agreed.

                         ME

                   (nod to agreement)

               I get a copy of that?

                         WELLES NOONAN

               After a judge signs it. Now Leave.

     Stand-nod-take my coffee-leave. Door closes. Noonan shreds

     the Witness agreement. Tosses it in the trash. Off the

     baffled Deputy.

                          WELLES NOONAN (CONT'D)

               We wait for him to deliver, then we

               arrest him. You never saw that

               agreement.

                           DEPUTY #1

               Tail him?

                         WELLES NOONAN

               No. Let him get comfortable...let

               him believe me.

83   INT. CAB - NIGHT                                             83

     Backseat. Suborned Cabby driving fast. LAPD on board.

                         ME (V.O.)

               Running out of room, time, both.

               Trapped between Bradley and Noonan.

     Jump out of the cab, into Wilhite's Powerhawk. Slide in, slam

     the door.

84   INT. MEG'S PLACE - LATER                                     84

     Bust in shaking. Teeth chatter like I'm freezing. Pete in the

     garage adjacent the kitchen, welder's goggles and a power

     drill, punching holes in Junior's safe.

                         PETE

               I know what Feds look like -- those

               were Feds with Junior...

                                                             98.

                         ME

               Yeah and they made me leaving the

               scene. Had to barter out.

                         PETE

               Barter what?

                         ME

               My Testimony. I signed a Federal

               Witness Agreement.

     Pete drops the drill.

                           PETE

               You what?

                          ME

               It's bullshit. Noonan's got no

               intention of honoring it.

                   (beat)

               They want Stemmons files though. I

               think Junior's been working angles

               for awhile, doing his own

               investigations.

                         PETE

               What did you do to his place? Nice

               quiet neighborhood one minute,

               Nagasaki the next.

                         ME

                   (point to safe)

               He had a hand grenade tied to that.

                   (as Pete resumes drilling)

               How much longer do you need?

                          PETE

               Few more hours. Maybe. Junior

               didn't skimp on this thing. I gotta

               bore right through the face plate.

                   (beat)

               You got some time now, why don't

               you get Milteer off my back and go

               work that Bledsoe broad.

                         ME

               You read my mind.

85   EXT. TOPANGA CANYON BUNGALOW - NIGHT                      85

     Pull in. Glenda's Vette parked behind. Lights on low inside.

                                                             99.

86   EXT./INT. BUNGALOW - MOMENTS LATER                        86

     The door opens. She's dressed for bed. I don't hesitate,

     afraid she'll shun me. Move to her, she doesn't startle. An

     arm around her waist, drawing her in, my mouth close to hers.

     I take her face in my hand, check her eyes, a beat before

     they tell me it's okay...I lean in, takes a lifetime...and

     kiss her soft until she kisses back, her mouth moving over my

     split lips, she puts her hands on my face, pulling me in.

     She feels exactly like I imagined.

     My coat comes off. Her camisole follows. We're moving toward

     a bed in back. I stop, pull back, the moonlight moves over

     her shoulders. I whisper:

                         ME

               ...tell me if I'm being too rough.

     Tears squeezed through smiling eyes, she kisses me even

     harder, pulls me down to her. We make love like we've never

     touched another. Everything blurs, burns down: Bradley.

     Wilhite. Tommy. Hector Junior. Ainge. She takes it all away.

     I escape into her. Hours fall. I could stay here forever...

87   INT. BEDROOM - LATER                                      87

     Lying there, staring at her. A silence and peace I've never

     known. Not once.

                         ME

               Tell me anything. Tell me

               everything.

     Label her surprise, her brow that furrows and unfurrows just

     as quickly. A long moment as she waivers...commits:

          You?

          No...I don't think so.

              (beat)

          I just love it. I grew up in

          Seattle. My aunt, every week, she'd

          take me to the movies.

Me watching her...tucks her hair back over his shoulders.

          Sounds silly doesn't it? `Attack of

          Hughes told me he could get me in

          for this screen test two years ago.

          Movie with Gregory Peck at

          Universal. He thought he was

          humoring me...until I got it. They

          offered me the role...there in the

          room. So Howard, who I'm sure never

          thought in a million years I'd land

          that part, makes some phone calls

          and just like that they don't want

          me anymore.

              (beat)

          Nobody calls now. I can't get in to

          see any studio casting people. He's

          ruined me in those circles.

          And you still want it-

                    GLENDA BLEDSOE

          -bad enough to put on a silly

          cheerleading skirt and try to make

          the most god-awful dialogue sound

          Surrounded by winos in werewolf

          suits.

              (she laughs, I laugh)

          That's...dedication.

                    GLENDA BLEDSOE

          Or desperation. Depends on the day.

The laughter ebbs, her eyes still shine.

                     GLENDA BLEDSOE (CONT'D)

          I'll get there though.

              (beat)

          I'll get there.

I let the silence take...try not to shatter it with:

          Dwight Gillette.

She doesn't blanch.

                     GLENDA BLEDSOE

          He asked me to take his `niece and

          nephew' to their cousin in Oxnard.

          These beautiful, funny little kids.

              (tears she doesn't swipe)

          I dropped them off. Didn't ask any

          questions -- I believed Dwight. A

          week later I saw their pictures in

          the Post Office. A week after that

          their little bodies came in on the

          tide near San Pedro.

              (beat, tears stream)

          I'll never shake the thought that

          maybe those poor kids thought I was

          part of it. That I knew what was

          going to happen to them. So I pray

          to God that he let them look in

          when I put that knife into Dwight.

              (beat)

          But I'll never ask his forgiveness

          for doing it...

              (beat, clears her eyes)

          Why do they call you `Enforcer?'

She actually gets closer, I can feel her breath on me.

                         GLENDA BLEDSOE

               `For profit -- mostly.'

     Silence. A feeling like: `and there we are...'

                         ME

               I'm not much good.

                         GLENDA BLEDSOE

               Me neither.

     She touches my quake. Two breaths with her hand on mine and

     it all goes quiet: the shakes, the images, the fear. She

     takes my head, pulls me to her bare breasts. The only things

     audible: my breathing, a clock ticking. Both slowly fade out.

     BLACK.

     Wake up quiet, look at my Hamilton. 6 AM. Sit up slow.

     Look back at her, sleeping, just stare. I lean down, kiss her

     lightly, her taste lingers, inhale her, hold that...it's the

     last good thing you'll get today.

88   INT. MEG'S HOUSE - EARLY A.M.                                88

     Dark. Stay quiet. Maneuver into the kitchen. Turn on a light.

     On the table: safe open, it's contents laid-out neatly, short-

     stacks of files, $1000 in twenties. I sit, start searching

     for something else...Pete's voice behind me:

                         PETE (O.C.)

               The Knife ain't there. File on top

               of that middle pile: George Ainge

               in an `undisclosed locale.'

     I don't turn. Pete sits next to me. Sets a shotgun down.

                         PETE

               Junior documented everything like a

               fucking Monk.

                   (pulls a file)

               Like here: `has evidence' you

               murdered Sanderline Johnson.

                         (MORE)

                                                            103.

                     PETE (cont'd)

           Kept track of `suspected contract

           killings' you pulled for the mob.

Look at Pete. Dark rings, deathbed eyes.

                     ME

           You been up all night?

                     PETE

           In-case Stemmons made a house-call.

           He's got every goddamn address of

           everybody you know...

               (beat, hard)

           And you should've told me about the

           Bledsoe broad.

                     ME

           There's nothing to tell.

Feature Pete, righteously pissed:

                     PETE

           Then call Milteer about this dead

           Pimp Gillette. I'm no legal mind

           like you, but I'll bet a murder

           beef would violate her morals

           clause quick.

               (beat, hands phone)

           Collect the rest of your money.

                     ME

           I don't want it anymore.

                     PETE

           Then give that five grand back.

                     ME

           Junior stole it.

Pete pauses, scoffs, turns back toward Meg's bedroom walks:

                     PETE

           People are gonna start lining-up to

           see you bleed, Pal.

Door closes. I flip through Junior's files: the same

architect-neat block printing. Find a Glenda entry:

SUBSEQUENT TO HER FATAL STABBING OF DWIGHT Gillette, MISS BLEDSOE

SECRETED THE MURDER WEAPON WITH GEORGE AINGE. I HAVE ACQUIRED THIS

KNIFE. IT IS A SIX-INCH BLADE WITH A MOTHER-OF-PEARL GRIP WHICH

SUSTAINED RIGHT THUMB AND RIGHT INDEX PRINTS WHICH MATCH ELEVEN

COMPARISON POINTS TO FINGERPRINTS ON FILE FROM MISS BLEDSOE'S 1946

JUVENILE SHOPLIFTING ARREST.

                                                            104.

     Shred it. Grab another file. Hyper-detailed: subscript

     clarifications, attachments, pictures, procedural notes to

     the U.S.A.W.N.: United States Attorney Welles Noonan.

     Then I see the tab of the file furthest down: BOYCE BRADLEY.

     Open it: Noonan's business card stapled to the front cover.

     Flip forward. Scan. See Bradley's name, finger tracks across

     a page. A company name: `HURWITZ HOLDINGS'

     I read it all...and feel my jaw slowly unhinge...

89   INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - MORNING                           89

     Barrel down the hallway toward Bradley's office. A habitual

     eye toward Junior's desk: Koenig going through his drawers.

     Stop. Veer toward him...

                         KOENIG

                   (formal-frosty)

               Your young partner called me at my

               home, early this morning.

     Teeth grit. Hide it. Let Koenig talk.

                         KOENIG (CONT'D)

               Heavily inebriated. Speaking

               inarticulately of `betrayal,' & how

               the LAPD was set to be `blitzed by

               justice.' Is this the `bind' of

               which we spoke earlier?

                         ME

               Yeah.

                         KOENIG

               And his apartment -- there was some

               type of disturbance? A fire?

                         ME

               That's why I needed his address. I

               was trying to help him before

               something like this happened. The

               kid snapped-in-half Fritz. He's

               literally lost it.

                   (beat, deadpan)

               He say anything else to you?

     Koenig looks back at me. Give nothing away...one gesture that

     doesn't read right and he'll know. He lets more seconds pass

     than he should. Trying to shake me.

                                                            105.

                         KOENIG

               Only that he was in possession of

               materials that might deeply damage

               Chief Bradley...and yourself.

                         ME

               Like I said Fritz, he's flipped his

               lid. I don't want to go to Internal

               Affairs but I'm afraid Junior

               might've forced just that.

                         KOENIG

               Let me try to locate the lad first

               Dave. Be a shame to ruin such a

               young career so soon.

                         ME

               Be careful Fritz. He's dangerous.

     Spin, press on toward Bradley's office.

                         ME (V.O.)

               Fritz Koenig, the best inspector in

               the LAPD, digging. He'll find

               Junior and when he does he'll find

               Ainge...then Glenda...

     Reach Bradley's office, burst in. Empty. To his Secretary:

                         ME

               Where is he?

                         SECRETARY

                   (frowns at my informality)

               Out at the Ravine Lieutenant.

90   EXT. CHAVEZ RAVINE - DAY                                     90

     Park the Powerhawk. Downwind. Out. Walking. Check my

     Hamilton: 12:10 PM.

                         ME (V.O.)

               Noonan's deadline lapsed ten

               minutes ago. An official fugitive

               from justice now.

     Down below, Bradley with Reuben Ruiz in-tow: glazed-fear,

     following him like he's handcuffed. PROTESTORS gather,

     placards hoisted, chants: "Dodgers, No! Mexico, Si!" The

     group gathers steam, supporters pack in, the chorus

     continues: "DODGERS NO! MEXICO SI!'

                                                       106.

                    ME (V.O.)

          Bradley doing damage control, the

          forced relocation of the Ravine's

          immigrants has the press in a

          feeding frenzy. Reuben Ruiz forced

          along as the token Mexican

          mouthpiece.

Reporters press. Bradley handles them with ease and aplomb.

                    BRADLEY

          -this area has long been rife with

          crime and venality, but with a

          brand new Stadium, we can make this

          horrible blight a bright spot and

          give our Los Angeles Dodgers the

          home they deserve.

              (like Ruiz was an orphan)

          Reuben Ruiz can tell you of his

          travails growing up in this

          horrible slum and why now is the

          time to `Redeem The Ravine.'

                    REPORTER #2

          Chief Bradley, U.S. Attorney

          Noonan has promised to deliver

          surprise witnesses before the

          Federal Grand jury on-

-Bradley, this brilliant rebuke:

                    BRADLEY

          -Welles Noonan is an unscrupulous

          hack politician whose smear

          campaign against us will fail, for

          he has grievously underestimated

          the moral rectitude of the Los

          Angeles Police Department.

Then Bradley sees me. His press-friendly face contorts, the

shift startling: if only a flashbulb could've framed it. He

shifts back from snarl to smile...

                    BRADLEY

          Now if you'll excuse me, I'll leave

          you with Reuben Ruiz.

Ruiz begins his forced/coerced/do-it-or-we'll-fuck-you sob

story as Bradley steps away from the glare. I follow. Get

right on his heels.

                                                          107.

                    ME

          Your subpoena hasn't caught up to

          me yet, Chief...

Bradley spins back.

                    ME (CONT'D)

              (hand him Junior's file)

          Hurwitz Holdings.

Bradley blanches, buckles. I see it. Before he can play

stupid with: `What?'

                    ME (CONT'D)

          You, Bethune, and Gallaudet bought

          big chunks of Chavez Ravine over

          the past two years through a shell

          company called Hurwitz Holdings.

              (beat, look around)

          If the Dodgers move here the value

          of the land booms...you could sell

          it off for a fortune -- or hang

          onto it and make even more. The

          parking lots alone would make you

          all multi-millionaires.

Bradley removes his glasses, staring at documentation that

dooms both his immediate and distant future...

                    ME

          Word gets out that the three City

          Officials who were pushing hardest

          for a Stadium also stood to gain a

          mint -- might color public opinion.

          Might color it even more to know

          that the LAPD's Chief of Detectives

          was trying to purchase a huge tract

          of that land from the biggest dope

          dealer in town.

Slap another file over the one he's reading.

                    ME

          Hector Magdalena owned ten and half

          acres of this land.

              (beat, ram him)

          You didn't give a shit about

          solving his disappearance. You were

          worried that your real estate deal

          was going south.

                    (MORE)

                                                       108.

                     ME (cont'd)

          That's why you wanted Tommy found,

          not because he was a murder suspect

          or you were concerned that Noonan

          might tap him as a federal

          witness...you needed him to

          finalize your fucking land grab. To

          sign paperwork in place of his dead

          Dad. That's why you've got Madge

          and Lucille in custody now.

              (beat)

          Maybe I'll let your subpoena find

          me now Chief, maybe I'll walk right

          into it...the tales I could tell.

All Bradley can muster is:

                    BRADLEY

          How?

                    ME

          Junior Stemmons. The ex-evidence

          teacher. His `excellent ratings'

          didn't stop him from stealing the

          Magdalena seizure and doing his own

          investigation.

                    BRADLEY

          Why would he investigate me?

Hand him Noonan's business card: dig the big Federal Eagle in

American Blue.

                     ME

          That was stapled to the cover.

              (beat)

          Why would Noonan worry about a Turd

          like me now...when a high profile

          target like you can be taken down.

Silence. I smile wide at it. Bradley, scrambling.

                    BRADLEY

          Where is Stemmons?

                    ME

          No idea. If you haven't spoken to

          Internal Affairs today, I'm sure

          they've called. Junior's apartment

          caught fire. Deeply deviant

          material inside. Round him up-

              (my angle)

          -and anyone he's got with him.

Bradley readjusts his glasses.

                                                         109.

                    BRADLEY

          I'll issue an A.P.B. saying

          Stemmons is a known deviant

          targeting kindergarten children.

                    ME

          Now, quid pro quo...you subpoenaed

          Wilhite too.

Bradley's reaction: Feature the angler getting angled.

                      BRADLEY

          How do y-

                    ME

          -don't worry `how.' Why?

Bradley says nothing. Then, like a klieg-light, it hits me.

                    ME (CONT'D)

          You're going after Narco yourself.

                    BRADLEY

          Exposing the corrupt parts of the

          LAPD will redeem the whole. I'll

          prove that Police can police

          themselves-

                    ME

          -so you show-up Noonan...co-opt his

          crusade and condemn your own before

          he can...Jesus Christ can you turn

          lemons to lemonade.

                    BRADLEY

          No Cop will testify against other

          Cops. This is why Wilhite has

          suddenly disappeared.

                     ME

          And how.

              (beat)

          So where do we go now Chief?

                    BRADLEY

              (beat, eyes flick again to

               the files I'm holding...)

          There are other forces at work

          here...faces we need to identify.

          Names we need to know. A third

          party.

                    (MORE)

                                                            110.

                         BRADLEY (cont'd)

               Find out who Klein and I'll

               reinstate you, rescind that

               subpoena & burn the coroner's

               report on Sanderline-

                         ME

               -that report is only useful to

               Noonan now.

                         BRADLEY

               No. It ensures our mutual

               destruction should you choose to

               share the contents of that Stemmons

               file. Which I know you won't do

               until you figure out how it will

               best benefit you.

     He walks off, imperious, impervious, gets engulfed by the

     press ranks once again.

                         ME (V.O.)

               A mistake to underestimate me now

               Chief. The price to keep your

               secrets is steep...and you're going

               to pay up. Soon.

     Back to the Powerhawk, fresh-scrubbed six-packs standing near

     it, the trunk stink ripe past the point of concealment. They

     see me, deferential nods. One squeaky wheel offers:

                         SIX-PACK

               Something in your trunk smells to

               high hell Lieutenant.

                            ME

               Dead body.

     Laughter. Easily amused academy types. Brush by grinning,

     give `em an "Enforcer" story to tell the other rookies. I

     jump in the Powerhawk and tear off.

                         ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)

               Borrowed time burning fast. My days

               are done. Only hours remain.

               Whatever moves I have left...make

               them now.

91   INT. MEG'S HOUSE - LATER                                     91

     Going through files. Filling my own steno pad with scrawl.

     Pete walks in from the garage, face bunched up, bit-lemon.

                                                       111.

                    PETE

          Fucking Christ. You can't keep that

          car in the garage, the smell's

          coming into the house.

Meg wanders in, dressed for work.

                    MEG

          Open the windows.

                    PETE

          That's not gonna help.

                    ME

              (still scribbling)

          Take a couple bottles of bleach,

          pour it over the trunk.

                    PETE

          What do you got in there?

                    ME

          My foreseeable future.

                    MEG

          I'm going to work.

She kisses me on my head. I turn:

                    ME

          You taking her?

                    PETE

              (God damn glowering)

          I'm taking her.

Meg walks out. Pete lingers. I'm starting to sour him. Not

smart. He stares. I look up.

                    ME (CONT'D)

          What?

                    PETE

          Hughes.

                    ME

          This is almost over Pete -- I'll

          give Milteer the five-grand back.

                    PETE

          It's more than that.

                                                       112.

                    ME

          I'll square it. It's my thing.

                    PETE

          That you made mine.

                       ME

          I'm sorry.

A beat. Pete sketches me head to toe.

                    PETE

          Look as bad as I've ever seen you.

                    ME

          Things are as bad as they've ever

          been...

Pete exhales. Stalks off. I keep scribbling.

                    ME (V.O.)

          Bradley's Third Party Theory.

          Everything linked: Wilhite,

          Magdalena, the Ravine...I've got my

          own theories...and the one that

          sticks is the one I pray I'm wrong

          about.

Meg's phone blares, I answer it on reflex.

                       ME (CONT'D)

          Klein.

I hear rasp on the other end, hyperventilating, unhinged.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS

          MOTHERFUCKER -- you better meet me!

          That Cooze you threw everything

          away for is still cooked! I got the

          knife. I got Ainge-

Junior. Jesus.

                    ME

          How'd you get this number Junior?

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS

          I got everything on you! AND I'M

          GONNA USE IT!

                    ME

          -you're a broom-closet Queer. Your

          career is over.

                                                       113.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS

          The knife for MY file on Bradley.

          I know you already burned that

          Whore's but don't think I can't re-

          do investigations.

                    ME

          You snitch to Noonan, then what?

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS

          Fuck Noonan. I got stronger Allies.

                    ME

          Who? The Soviets?

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS

          Meet me in one hour with that file,

          Fern Dell Park-

                    ME

          -Where you used to snag fruits for

          Vice? A volunteer gig I'm guessing.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS

          Be there with Bradley's file or I

          scratch your scabby Bitch.

                    ME

          Hey, did the Feds dig your pad?

The phone on the other end seems to break-in half. Hang up,

it rings a beat later. Junior still wanting to spar. Snag the

receiver, rip his shit:

                    ME (CONT'D)

          -I see anybody near there Junior,

          the deals off and I gift that file

          to Bradley to fuck you with-

                    GLENDA BLEDSOE

          -Dave?

                    ME

              (big beat)

          Glenda?

He's got her. Junior. Sick. Evil. My mind cannibalizes itself

with "where-is-she-how-do-I-get-her-back" when:

                    GLENDA BLEDSOE

          Sorry...you gave me this number...

He doesn't have her. A sigh so big, it steals all my air...

                                                            114.

                           ME

                 Jesus...hey...

92   INTERCUT:                                                  92

                           GLENDA

                 Who were you talking-

                           ME

                 -no, no. It's nothing. I had a

                 phone call, just before yours.

     A beat. Glenda in a chaise lounge on a small deck overlooking

     the canyon. She sits up.

                           GLENDA

                 Was it him? The Cop you were

                 telling me about?

                           ME

                 I don't want you to worry. I'm

                 handling it. But I might send my

                 friend Pete out there.

                           GLENDA

                 You don't think it's safe?

                           ME

                 I'd just rather have someone there

                 with you.

                           GLENDA

                 I wish you would've woken me up

                 this morning.

                           ME

                 I'm better-looking in low light, I

                 didn't want to blow it for myself.

     She laughs. Makes me smile despite my world caving-in...

                           ME (CONT'D)

                 Stay by the phone.

                           GLENDA

                 I miss you.

     And I melt. Love-struck at possibly the worst fucking moment

     of my life. Hang up before your voice breaks. Grab a pen,

     scrawl for Pete, post it on the fridge magnet: `PETE: 655

     TOPANGA. STAY WITH HER. PLEASE.'

                                                            115.

93   EXT. FERN DELL PARK - EVENING                             93

     Rolling green. Half-dirt, half-asphalt path. I scan for any

     back-up. Nothing. Junior already there. Astride like Gary

     Cooper. His eyes bloodshot from here. My gun riding quick-

     draw style. The heft feels good. Unbutton my coat to show him

     the file as I approach, tucked right behind my .45.

                         ME

               Where's the knife.

     Junior, this evil little curl. He turns. Follow him over a

     small knoll: that Gray Packard, waiting. A silhouette behind

     the wheel. As we near it the lights come on, blind me.

                         ME

               Turn your lights off...and just

               come out and talk to me...Fritz.

     A pause in the car, Junior looks at me like I'm Rasputin,

     divining answers from the marine-layer moving-in over LA. The

     lights pop off and I hear a tired laugh coming from the car

     that we've all heard before.

                         ME (V.O.)

               Third Party Confirmed...I fucking

               knew it.

     Fritz Koenig steps out of the Packard.

                         KOENIG

               Not much with these sub-rosa

               things...

                         ME

                   (a nod to the Packard)

               I thought it was Noonan tailing me.

                         KOENIG

               Bradley's greatest stroke was

               enlisting you to his side.

     Junior, jumpy in my periphery. I don't like it.

                         ME (CONT'D)

               Wilhite ran Magdalena for you, not

               Narco.

                         KOENIG

               When did you know?

                                                              116.

                         ME

               I didn't. I had a feeling. I

               smelled cover-up all over Hector's

               disappearance and Wilhite wouldn't

               have the muscle or the mind-set to

               kingpin something that big by

               himself...you knew about Bradley

               trying to buy him out?

                         KOENIG

               He was offering to exonerate Hector

               and clear his criminal record.

               Hector met with Wilhite and I to

               inform us of his decision...

                                                    FLASHBACK TO:

94   INT. 1284 SOUTH TREMAINE - PAST                                94

     For the first and only time, WE SEE Hector Magdalena, alive

     and well...for the moment...speaking to Koenig and Wilhite.

                         KOENIG (V.O.)

               ...to accept Bradley's deal...

     Koenig pets Hector's twin Doberman guard dogs.

                         KOENIG (V.O.) (CONT'D)

               ...and although the terms of that

               deal worked well for him. I found

               them less than favorable...

     Koenig draws a silenced pistol and shoots both dogs before

     shooting a shocked Hector twice in the chest. Wilhite

     staggers to his feet as Koenig steps over and delivers the

     coup de grace head-shot to Hector.

                         KOENIG

               Darktown. Chavez Ravine. Hot Spots

               for Human Vice. These are slums I

               run & profit from. If these slums

               suddenly become Stadiums, that

               profit goes elsewhere...that crime

               goes elsewhere.

                         ME

               Bradley...you two got greed in

               common.

     Koenig grins. Junior keeps shifting. Dying to shoot him dead.

                                                       117.

                    ME

          You knew about Wilhite and Lucille.

          That's how you were operating him.

                    KOENIG

          I was aware of his sexual

          predilections.

                    ME

              (a scowl for Junior)

          ...and someone else's...

                     KOENIG

              (that great white grin )

          We share an eye for human frailty

          and we're both born blackmailers

          Dave.

              (beat)

          I knew young Stemmons here had a

          fondness for Lads, stretching back

          to his days at the academy.

                    ME

          And now you're his only ally.

              (back at Junior)

          This sad queer who fell out with

          cops and flunked out with the Feds.

              (back to Koenig)

          So you get this file to battle

          Bradley with. What's Junior get in

          return?

And like he was waiting for those words: Junior lunges. I

twist to deflect but he's too fast -- feel something sink and

drag in my side. I go down, gouge/groping for my gun. Instant

trauma zaps nerves numb up the arm, fingers failing. Then a

pain like boiling oil moves through my blood.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS

          JUST YOU! YOU FUCK!

Look down, SEE: A mother-of-pearl knife hilt in my side, the

business end stuck deep. Junior laughing as I fall to my

knees. He pulls the file from the waist and tosses my .45.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS (CONT'D)

              (two inches from my face)

          THERE'S YOUR KNIFE KLEIN!

Koenig takes the file, opening it.

                                                       118.

                    KOENIG

              (turning his back)

          I don't want to watch...I'm sorry

          it came to this, Dave.

Junior, his own .45 pulled, put to my head.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS

          I hope the Bledsoe whore was worth

          it...'cuz she's still fucked. For a

          crooked cop, you think small.

Koenig reads the file's first page, lifts it...a blank page

behind...and behind that one...

                    ME (V.O.)

          Whatever moves I had left...I just

          made.

Koenig spins back, more blank pages spilling from the file.

                    KOENIG

          This isn't it!

-Junior looks: that's all I need. Pull the pig-sticker off my

ankle and corkscrew it into his calf, twisting. Junior bleats

slaughtered-lamb as I reach up a wrench his gun free. Grab

his tie, pull him down as I jut his gun up under his chin and

fire two shots through the top of his head.

Haul him down dead by his tie, turn -- Koenig's gun-hand

flashes to his shoulder. Shoot him twice. He goes down

gargling `fuck'. Stand-up on me sea-legs, bad wobble/weave as

I slowly pull the knife from my side, pocket it. Feel blood

flow saturate my pant leg. This weird wooze overcomes me as I

approach Koenig.

He pulls himself into a sitting position, shaking his head.

This bemused, beaten, half-grin as he flicks blood from his

hand like his fingers had just brushed something sticky.

                    KOENIG

          Poorly played Dave...poorly

          played...

Say nothing. Keep Junior's .45 out. My intention crystal

clear: endgame. Koenig looks up, this odd squint, like a bum

about to beg for change.

                    KOENIG

          Could I talk you into something?

          Cut you in on something?

                                                            119.

     Give him no hope.

                         ME

               Won't work for me Fritz.

     He nods, remorse, resignation...it at all looks the same now.

                         KOENIG

               Give me a minute then?

     I do. Watch his hands as he removes his shoes, waiting for an

     ankle grab, his back-up piece...none comes. He sets his shoes

     aside, gazing up at the starless sky before issuing this

     short, gruff laugh...some inside joke that will die untold.

                         KOENIG

                   (with a nod)

               Okay...

     ...and he holds his last breath and seems completely content

     as I shoot him. Cross to Junior now, rifle his clothes,

     retrieve a hotel key, Room 16, read it: MOTEL COMMODORE -

     1195 Centinela Ave. Inglewood, CA 90302

95   INT. MOTEL COMMODORE - INGLEWOOD - LATE NIGHT             95

     George Ainge, sweating on a stained bedsheet, smoking reefer,

     goofing on a TV test pattern, randomly pulling at his dick.

     Walk by his window, he sees me, recognition kinks -- thinks

     this is a good sign...I shoot him right through the glass.

96   EXT. TUDOR MANSION - EARLY A.M.                           96

     Bradley, roused from sleep, silk robe, coming down the

     stairs, his back door wide open. Reaches the landing, turns

     on the light.

     Feature me, this bobble-eyed ghoul, bloodying his settee. I

     look like something exhumed. His monogrammed serving napkins

     soak up blood from my knifed side. He startles school-girl.

     Throw the file at his feet: marred, mangled, stained. He

     inches forward, cinching his robe.

                         BRADLEY

               Who?

                         ME

               Fritz Koenig.

                                                       120.

                      BRADLEY

                (going pale)

            Where?

                      ME

            Dead. Along with Wilhite,

            Junior...and Hector Magdalena.

                      BRADLEY

            Why are you here?

                      ME

            To collect. I have the things you

            need to destroy Noonan's play.

            These same things can be used to

            destroy you.

Bradley, prim, proper, even this early. He sits down across

from me like some fucking Duke.

                      BRADLEY

            Things like?

                      ME

            Stemmons files...and Wilhite's

            body. He committed suicide after

            you subpoenaed him.

                      BRADLEY

            This body is in your possession?

Just nod.

                      ME

            And it's what you need to burn

            Narco to the ground...but if those

            files and his body were to be given

            to Noonan and the Feds, with me

            providing the cherry-on-top

            testimony of a rogue cop. Well. The

            word `Cataclysmic' comes to mind.

                      BRADLEY

            What will this cost?

                      ME

            A percentage of your Dodger Stadium

            stake in perpetuity. You buy my

            silence for a fourth of Hurwitz

            Holdings.

Bradley scoffs, pithy smile.

                                                               121.

                           BRADLEY

               Doubtful.

                         ME

               What'd you expect? A stick-up?

               Empty your safe? I'm about to

               disappear for good, and you're

               gonna fund my new life. You can't

               counter-punch out of this. Arrest

               me and I snitch the world.

                   (point to the file)

               I'll hold that over your head for

               the rest of your life. Renege on

               our deal and it won't matter if

               it's tomorrow or ten years from

               now...I'll fry you with that file.

                   (at my cracked Hamilton)

               I'm officially outta time now

               Chief. Call it.

     Bradley: an actual, full-blown facial tic. His Adam's apple

     bobs as he realizes that he's finally been beaten.

                         BRADLEY

               Wilhite's body...Bury it.

97   INT. PETE'S CADILLAC - MORNING                               97

     Cruising up the Topanga Canyon. Almost home...

                         ME (V.O.)

               Shaking to see her, touch her...

98   EXT. BUNGALOW - MORNING                                      98

     Door locked. Knocking. Pete opens up. Standing drunk. A

     pissed-off nod.

99   INT. BUNGALOW - NEXT MOMENT                                  99

     Liquor wafts off of him.

                         ME

               You go to bed drunk, or just been

               up all night.

     No answer as I follow him into the house.

                         KLEIN

               Where's Glenda, is she asle-

                                                       122.

-round the corner: Glenda shaking but refusing to cry. I go

pale: what is this? Somebody to the left, look: Milteer. Look

back at Pete: tears in his bleary eyes as he crushes me with

a right cross.

                    ME (V.O.)

          Seen Pete do this a dozen times and

          every time the same thought: God

          help me if he ever hits me like

          that...

Instant-drop, moan. Glenda screaming.

                    ME (CONT'D)

          Don't kill me.

Pete looks to Milteer, wipes blurred eyes.

                    MILTEER

          The harder you hit him the quicker

          I say `stop' -- and cease that

          absurd crying.

Pete bludgeons me. I try to get closer to Glenda. Feel my

nose shatter. Another swing: right cheek detonates. A left

hook to take advantage of my momentum: left eye explodes.

Glenda's crying/screaming gets me madder than anything.

                    GLENDA BLEDSOE

              (at Milteer)

          THAT IMPOTENT SHIT-

                    MILTEER

          -touch me and he dies.

Pete knocks me down again. My face in pieces.

                    MILTEER (CONT'D)

          Kick him-kick him-kick him.

Pete hesitates, puts his boot into my guts: 1, 2, 3-

                    MILTEER (CONT'D)

              (prim, official)

          -you may stop.

              (beat, for the room)

          Howard determined that this was the

          price for your time together.

Milteer produces a Polaroid, takes a snapshot of my shattered

husk, hands the camera to Pete on his way out:

                                                             123.

                          MILTEER

                You still have a job.

      Milteer gone. I spit volumes of blood. I'll talk with a slur

      for the next year. Pete reaches for me, blotto, sobbing.

                          PETE

                ...I'm sorry Dave...

      Pushing out words past shattered teeth.

                          ME

                I put you here...that Powerhawk-

                          PETE

                -there's a body in the trunk-

                             ME

                -burn it.

      Big drunk nod from Pete. Glenda panicking, trying to stanch

      blood that keeps rushing. Pete, reeling drunk, leans down,

      stuffs something in my jacket.

                          PETE

                I'm so sorry....

100   INT. SHOWER - TIME UNKNOWN                               100

      Steaming water. Almost painful. I sit in the tub, let the

      shower rain down. Drain floods diluted red. Wash my wounds,

      my soul. So many bruises I look bubonic. My face still

      swelling, already purple-black. My left eye more than swollen

      shut. On the other side of the curtain:

      Glenda naked. Beauty that catches in my chest. Try to stand,

      turn my destroyed face. She gently pushes me back down. Sits

      into me, holds my face in both hands so that the water hits

      my lips. No nerves, no unease. Home. She closes the curtain.

101   INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT                                     101

      Post-coital. Both wide awake. Still scared.

                          GLENDA

                Let me take you to a hospital.

                          ME

                We'd never make it inside.

                                                             124.

                          GLENDA

                    (big beat)

                I'm worried.

                          ME

                I'm through the worst of it.

      She frames my face with her hands.

                          GLENDA

                I don't believe you.

      Lies will only leak, expose. The silence makes me just as

      guilty. She lets me off the hook, her head on my arm, leaning

      in. I kiss her.

                          GLENDA (CONT'D)

                    (at a whisper)

                Was I worth this?

                          ME

                Whatever the cost.

                          GLENDA

                Just like that then?

                          ME

                Just like that.

      A nod. An understanding. Another kiss, the last one I'll

      remember.

102   INT. COLD WATER CANYON BUNGALOW KITCHEN - BLACK A.M.       102

      Head shaved. Stopped bleeding. You clearly see what my face

      will look like 25 years hence. Gauze over my left eye.

      Reading the Paper: my dress-blue photo, the one that looks

      nothing like me now. Headline:

           `LAPD Officer Wanted in Connection with

                My deadline with Noonan: two days

                old. He and Bradley playing chess

                           ME (V.O.) (cont'd)

                Bradley relocates the deaths of

                Captain Fritz Koenig and Sergeant

                Bradley's press fodder cast them as

                `outlaw cop and drug dealer' who

                most likely fled to Mexico. Narco

                under a full-blown, Bradley-led

                investigation.

                          BRADLEY (ON SCREEN)

                ...police unit run amok, who's long

103   INT. BEDROOM - BLACK A.M.                                  103

      Just sit and watch Glenda. Listen to her sleep: rhythmic

      breathing. The little natural smiling curl to her lips.

      Blonde hair splayed over white sheets. Touch her.

                          ME (V.O.)

                I haven't loved you long enough to

                leave it all behind...Too many

                enemies. Too many ways for you to

                get hurt. Too close to me...a

                decision that will haunt me the

                rest of my days...

      The Gillette knife, fold it in a kerchief, gift-wrap it to

      Glenda. Place a letter under it on the night stand:

                          ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                "My Heaven: the hours I had with

                you. My Hell: the years ahead,

                without. Someday I'll see you

                before you even know I'm looking."

                                                               126.

      I stand quiet, `grief' the best word but still not enough.

      Choke back tears as I lift Pete's camera and take the black

      and white picture you've seen before.

      Put my jacket on, pull the paper out of my pocket that Pete

      planted...a TWA Airline voucher. I smile small...

                                                     FLASHBACK TO:

104   INT. LAX - MORNING                                          104

      A Times vending machine: paper blazing with front page photos

      of wanted cop Dave Klein. I walk right past my old face. Past

      Cops and Feds camped out, looking for me.

                           ME (V.O.)

                Pete's penance beating built me a

                brand new face...nobody gives me a

                second glance...not even the cops I

                recognize.

      Up to the TWA counter: glance up at the departures board-

      BLACK.

105   INT. HILLSIDE VILLA - MORNING                               105

      I'm old. Stare at my leather-tan, once-broken face in a

      gilded mirror. The breaks occurred a lifetime ago, healed

      uneven. I start to pack my suitcases. Old files you think you

      may have seen before. An old gun you know you've seen before.

      Movements slow and steady in my advancing age...

                           ME (V.O.)

                My will to remember. My confession

                      ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)

          Glenda: twenty-five years avoiding

          her name. Only a photograph,

          yellowed with years-passed,

          reminding me of everything I never

          was.

               (beat)

          Then a week-old Times at the place

          I buy coffee. Her picture sees me

Put her photo in my chest pocket. Push the week-old Times

into a waste-basket: a Pan-Am ticket to LA underneath.

                    ME (V.O.)

          ...and it asked me to revoke our

          time apart, redeem it...tell her

          anything...tell her everything...

I stand, shatter the mirror that reminds me of how long. And

as I step out, an old man twenty-five years too late, and my

MGM-handsome, 1958 face smiles back at me through the shards.
