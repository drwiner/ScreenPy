   CLOSE SHOT-QUINN'S LEG

   A nervous leg shakes under the table. The appendage seems

   to be attached to someone who has a lot on their mind.

   INT. CAFE-DAY

   LOUIS, a college student in his late twenties stares at a

   friend who is sitting off screen. Louis is calm, almost

   villainous in how collective he is.

   He stares at this unseen friend, trying to assess the

   cause for his anxious state.

                        LOUIS

                 (smug)

          Something is bothering you...

   We finally see QUINN, also in his late twenties. He is

   obviously uneasy about being out in public with this

   person.

                       QUINN

          I appreciate the faux concern but I'm

          fine.

   Louis is taken aback.

                       LOUIS

          My concern is genuine...

                       QUINN

          With our history can you honestly say you

          care about my well being?

                       LOUIS

          Yes I can, our connection is a product of

          destiny. I have no ill-will against you.

   Quinn scoffs.

                         QUINN

          1941-

                       LOUIS

          -The Stephen Speilberg film?

                       QUINN

          No, there was that little French girl I

          liked. You..you violated her and torched

          her farm killing her family-

                                                      2.

                       LOUIS

          -Actually you are jacking up the story, I

          violated her father in front of

          her...then I torched the farm.

                       QUINN

          Well...that makes it ten times better.

                       LOUIS

          Quinn that was war, people do crazy

          things midst of wide spread conflict. I

          have gotten jaded over time. It's not

          like the dark ages when I had style.

                       QUINN

          When you would rape the horses and ride

          away on the women?

                       LOUIS

          Yeah I was such a ham.

          (beat)

          Quinn, this is what we do. I have gotten

          carried away in the past, but now I'm

          tired. I just want to get this over with.

          It's our calling, we help bring order and

          balance to the universe.

           (beat)

          Maybe I would feel less removed if you

          would let me win just once.

                       QUINN

          This isn't a 1930's boxing match. If I

          take dive, I'm not lining the pockets of

          some bookie...I'm bringing on the

          apocalypse.

Louis takes a drink of his coffee.

                       LOUIS

          See at least our obligation would be

          over.

                       QUINN

          Louis I might be nervous, but I accept my

          role as savior of this world.

          (beat)

          We have been doing this for years-

                        LOUIS

          -centuries-

                       QUINN

          -and in 5 days we will do the same thing

          we have always done.

                       (MORE)

                                                       3.

                       QUINN (CONT'D)

          (beat)

          We'll fight to the death.

                       LOUIS

          Atta' boy!

TITLECARD: CHRIST COMPLEX

INT. CAFE-DAY-MOMENTS LATER

We pan across the cafe to the table of ZOEY and RICK, a

young college aged couple. Zoey is obviously trying to

have a serious conversation, while Rick hides behind his

laptop using it as a shield.

                       ZOEY

          ...I'm not saying this is an

          intervention.

Rick doesn't look up from his laptop screen.

                       RICK

          Wouldn't there be more people here if it

          was an intervention?

                       ZOEY

          See and I don't want it to be-

                       RICK

          (disinterested)

          -That's because it's not

                       ZOEY

          It's just...I mean...are you gambling

          again?

                       RICK

          (totally removed)

           Nope.

                       ZOEY

          Because...um...the laptop, and you never

          go anywhere with out it-

                       RICK

          -it's my lifeline-

                       ZOEY

          -Yeah well...I just know when I met you I

          saved you from that downhill spiral...you

          know...uh...the online poker-

                                                      4.

                       RICK

          -I'm not a project, you know that right?

                       ZOEY

          Of course not...I never said you were.

                       RICK

          Because you act like it...I wonder if I

          didn't have this "so called problem" if

          you would have even been interested in

          me.

                       ZOEY

          Of course I would. I just-

                       RICK

          -Take it upon yourself to save people.

                       ZOEY

          OK...maybe. Honestly we have to save each

          other, who else is going to do it.

                       RICK

          (continued to be removed)

          People could just save themselves.

                       ZOEY

          True. Is that human nature? People rely

          on false deities, self help books...Rick

          the day I realized we were alone in the

          universe was the day I realized we have

          to be there for each other.

          (beat)

          Plus don't you find it romantic that I

          want to save you? Like a movie...

                       RICK

          So our relationship is like a romantic

          comedy?

                       ZOEY

          (dreamy)

          A Cameron Crowe romantic comedy.

                       RICK

          Oh well...so do you want to see what I'm

          doing on the computer?

Zoey feels like she has broken down the "wall".

                       ZOEY

          Yes...of course!

                                                      5.

Rick spins the computer around.

                       RICK

          Check that out Lloyd Dobler.

                       ZOEY

          (Shocked)

           Is that...porn?

                       RICK

          Red Tube...like You Tube...but with porn.

                       ZOEY

          Um....

          (lightbulb)

           wait...is that?

                       RICK

          Oh yes...

                       ZOEY

          Us having sex?

                       RICK

          Oh yeah...

Rick reaches over and points at the laptop screen.

                       RICK (CONT'D)

          I love the part coming up.

           (beat)

          You know where I put your legs behind

          your head and yell "hump bunny!"

                       ZOEY

          Yeah...um...I'm not OK with this...

                       RICK

          Yeah...OK...I'm also breaking up with

          you.

                       ZOEY

          What?-

                       RICK

          -Yeah not working any more for me-

                       ZOEY

          What the hell?!? How is it not working?!?

                       RICK

          You are yelling...you know I don't like

          confrontational situations.

                                                          6.

                       ZOEY

          I'm not trying to be confrontational...I

          just...you are breaking up with me?

                       RICK

          -Yeah...Can I have my laptop back now?

Zoey, still confused, slowly turns the laptop back toward

Rick.

                       RICK (CONT'D)

          (looking at the screen)

           This part is fucking priceless.

Zoey is bewildered.

EXT. PARK-AFTERNOON

Louis kicks at the ground, almost as if he was searching

for something. His foot finally rests on a broken tree

limb.

He places his foot under it and kicks it up to his right

hand.

                       LOUIS

          This will do.

He throws it over to Quinn, who catches it in one swift

move.

                       QUINN

          So what are you wanting to do?

Louis searches around for a stick of his own.

                       LOUIS

          I figure we would train...

                       QUINN

          Why?

Louis finds what he is looking for as he spins his limb

into attack position.

                       LOUIS

          Because you dominate me every time-

          (beat)

          -ohh that sounded dirty

                       QUINN

          So you want me to help you get an

          advantage?

                                                       7.

                       LOUIS

          No, I want you to help me put on a good

          show. Everyone loves a good climax Quinn.

PARK-RIVERSIDE-CONTINUOUS

Zoey sits on a bench beside her best friend ANNA. Zoey is

completely distant, as Anna's words pass through her into

thin air.

                       ANNA

          You know I don't like interjecting myself

          into other people's affairs but-

                       ZOEY

          (barley paying attention)

          -But you're going to

                       ANNA

          You let Rick do this to you.

                       ZOEY

          (Snapping to it)

           How so?

                       ANNA

          You think you can change the men you are

          with. You can't get into a relationship

          with someone in the hopes that you can

          mold them into the person you want them

          to be.

                       ZOEY

          Rick needed someone stable-

                       ANNA

          -Rick needs castrated.

                       ZOEY

          That's slightly strong.

                       ANNA

          He was an asshole.

                       ZOEY

          Misunderstood-

                       ANNA

          -OK I'll meet you half

          way...misunderstood asshole.

           (beat)

          You have been repeating the same cycle

          your whole entire life.

                                                          8.

                         ZOEY

            Now that's a little off base.

                                                     CUT TO:

ANIMATED SEQUENCE

FLASHBACK

ZOEY 10 YEARS OLD

A young BOY is sitting on another little boy's head. It

looks like he is passing gas on him.

                         ANNA (V.O.)

            Remember Billy, who used to give kids the

            "dirty bomb"? You took it upon yourself

            to change this behavior-

The boy is now doing the same to Zoey.

                         ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

            -This put you right in the cross-hairs to

            be his next victim.

ZOEY 13 YEARS OLD

ZACK, a young teenager is selling drugs on the street

corner. His bags of coke should be exaggerated, as well

as the customers coming up to buy from him. Think if

South Park was crossed with HBO's The Wire.

                         ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

            Good old Zack the neighbourhood drug

            dealer-

Zoey takes Zack into a room labeled "Rehab" on the door.

                         ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

            -You took it upon yourself to be his

            personal savoir. What did it get you?

Zack is out with Zoey when a few of his old GANG FRIENDS

show up looking to collect. Zack opens his pockets to

show he doesn't have any dough on him.

                         ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

            Well when Zach's old business partners

            wanted to collect on a debt-

Zack slowly pushes Zoey toward them.

                                                          9.

A few days later we see Zoey being used as a human coffee

table as the gang uses her back to cut cocaine.

                       ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

          - they used you to replace their missing

          coffee table they broke during a drunken

          party.

ZOEY 17 YEARS OLD.

A gang member looks directly into the camera. He smiles

showing his golden grille.

                       ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

          -And then you have Toothpick. What kind

          of name is Toothpick?

                       ZOEY (V.O.)

          It was his gang name.

                       ANNA (V.O.)

          Of course.

It's prom night and Toothpick is in his "pimp" tux. He

takes a swig of his "40" while he dances with Zoey.

                       ANNA (CONT'D)

          We won't talk about prom night. Needless

          to say it wasn't romantic.

Toothpick and Zoey are in an hotel room. Toothpick is

standing over Zoey, who is facedown on the bed. It

appears he is urinating on her. It's hard to tell with

the black censor bar.

PARK-RIVERSIDE-PRESENT DAY

                       ZOEY

          Exaggerations-

                       ANNA

          -Accurate account of events... The story

          of your romantic life-

                       ZOEY

          -Unfair. Because these people need

          someone who is going to sacrifice their

          own needs for them.

                                                      10.

                       ANNA

          Why?

                       ZOEY

          Who else is going to do it? We're alone

          in the universe. If we are going to make

          it through this "crazy world" we need to

          look out for each other.

                       ANNA

          I think you use atheism and the whole "we

          are alone in the universe" jive to

          justify your actions.

          (beat)

          I regret taking you to see Dawkins

          because you use that as a fall back to be

          codependent.

                       ZOEY

          First of all you are bitter about the

          whole Dawkins thing, because you flashed

          him your tits and got us kicked out-

                       ANNA

          -You didn't even know the first thing

          about "The God Delusion" until I gave you

          a copy-

                       ZOEY

          -And someone who was huge supporter turns

          her back because Richard Dawkins didn't

          like her nipple piercing-

                       ANNA

          (playful banter)

          -Enjoy your suite in hell non-believer-

                       ZOEY

          (more banter)

          -Enjoy your delusional life there fence

          sitter. How about you pray to Thor to hit

          me with a lighting bolt so I can be

          You're hiding behind this religious

          debate because you don't want to admit

          you have always gravitated toward the

          "wrong type" of guy.

Zoey is staring off into space.

                                                        11.

                       ZOEY

          (detached)

          I actually stopped listening to you.

                       ANNA

          What are you staring at?

Zoey points at Quinn and Louis, who are fighting with

tree limbs in the distance.

                       ZOEY

          Who are those guys?

                       ANNA

          The one closest to us is Quinn. Very

          weird, socially awkward type of guy. I

          don't know who his friend is.

                       ZOEY

          What are they doing?

                       ANNA

          I don't know. Looks like that stuff my ex-

          Rob was into-

                       ZOEY

          Oh that medieval rugby style game-

                       ANNA

          -Yeah the made up sport from "Blood Of

          Heroes"...Oh...Jugger!-

                       ZOEY

          -Sounds pornographic.

           (beat)

          So Quinn? What else do you know about

          him?

                       ANNA

          Oh no you don't! This is exactly what I

          was talking about!

Anna senses something in Zoey that she is trying to hide.

                       ANNA (CONT'D)

          Wait a second? You've already established

          contact with Quinn?

                       ZOEY

          What is this MI-6?

                       ANNA

          You have your sights on him already!

                                                         12.

                       ZOEY

          No, I'm just curious.

                       ANNA

          What happened?

TITLE CARD: 2 HOURS AGO

PARK-RIVERSIDE-EARLIER

Zoey is overcome with emotion as she makes her way down

to the riverside. She is holding something tight in her

hand.

CLOSE UP-HAND

As her hand opens a class ring was digging into her palm.

It appears this might have belonged to Rick.

PARK-RIVERSIDE

Still teary eyed, Zoey angrily throws the ring toward the

river. A gust of wind causes the ring to curve and it

slams into the temple of a man sitting on a park bench.

Zoey walks over to apologize and meets Quinn for the

first time.

                       ZOEY

          (making her way to the bench)

          I'm so sorry

Quinn rubs his temple and then reaches down to pick up

the ring.

                       QUINN

          (handing the ring back to her)

          Is this yours?

She takes the ring and shoves it into her pocket.

                       ZOEY

          Kinda... Again I'm so sorry.

                       QUINN

          No need to apologize.

Quinn scoots over and motions for her to sit.

                                                      13.

                       QUINN (CONT'D)

          Do you want to sit?

                         ZOEY

          (unsure)

           OK?

Zoey sits, still apprehensive.

                       ZOEY (CONT'D)

          (reaching her hand out)

           I'm Zoey.

                       QUINN

          (He returns the gesture)

           Quinn.

          (beat)

          Zoey? Interesting.

                       ZOEY

          Oh name? Yes, most people have

          interesting stories behind their

          names...Honestly I have nothing. Not sure

          why my parents did that.

                         QUINN

          Very unique.

                       ZOEY

          (smiles)

          I suppose that's a compliment. So I've

          seen you around school, but never

          really...in...class...

                       QUINN

          I don't go to Marshall, I live near the

          campus though.

                       ZOEY

          Oh, well so what do you do?

                       QUINN

          As in profession? I don't really have

          one.

                       ZOEY

          Really? Rent is insane around here...

                       QUINN

          Yeah, my father provides for me.

                       ZOEY

          That's pretty cool. What's he into?

                                           14.

              QUINN

Everything.

             ZOEY

An entrepreneur...That's awesome.

(beat)

Well...So do you like coming down here?

             QUINN

To the river?

             ZOEY

(smiles)

Yes where we are right now.

             QUINN

I just needed to think.

             ZOEY

Yeah me too. I just suffered a break up.

             QUINN

My apologies.

             ZOEY

No it's OK. I mean I'm over it.

             QUINN

(laughs)

My head disagrees.

              ZOEY

I'm sorry.

             QUINN

It's really OK.

             ZOEY

So what did you need to think about? I

mean if I'm not prying of course.

             QUINN

No, I just have some problems.

(beat)

I'm not sure about my calling in life.

             ZOEY

I'm not sure anyone is. You know if you

need a friend, I'd be glad to...well you

know...listen.

             QUINN

I'd appreciate that. I don't have many

friends.

                                                         15.

                       ZOEY

          I know.

          (trying to double back)

          I mean...I've seen you around

          campus...you seem like a loner...I didn't

          mean you were a loser. Loner is kind of

          sexy, loser...well can kind of be

          too...I'll stop.

                       QUINN

          No, it's OK. I agree it never hurts to

          have a friend.

                       ZOEY

          So we can maybe go out to dinner if you

          want?

                       QUINN

          OK...

                       ZOEY

          And I can pay, you know..make up for the

          head...

                       QUINN

          You really don't have to.

                       ZOEY

          No I want to.

                       QUINN

          OK.

                       ZOEY

          Well...

          (beat)

          Good let's meet up tonight. My place,

          7pm.

TITLE CARD: 7PM

INT. ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-7PM

JACK, A 20 year old gay man who loves him a good "Cosby

Sweater", is sitting at the computer desk "surfing" on

the desktop.

Anna walks up from behind and runs her fingers through

Jack's hair.

                                                         16.

                       JACK

          So when does Ted Bundy get here?

We follow Anna across the room where she plops herself

down on the couch.

                       ANNA

          I promised her we would behave.

A KNOCK is heard at the front door.

                       ANNA (CONT'D)

          Although knocking right as I sat down

          doesn't endear him to me...

Jack gets up from the desk.

                       JACK

          You sit your pretty little ass down

          hooker.

Anna adjusts herself back down into the comfy couch.

                       ANNA

          This is why I don't need a boyfriend. You

          are way to good to me.

Jack opens the door to reveal Quinn.

                       JACK

          Look at this mother fucker.

He rudely motions him to come in and sit down.

                       JACK (CONT'D)

          Zoey is in the bathroom getting ready for

          a night of manipulation, sit the fuck

          down.

                       QUINN

          (confused)

          Um...OK?

In almost the same beat, Zoey walks into the room.

                       ZOEY

          Quinn, is he being rude?

                       QUINN

          (looking at Jack)

          No quite pleasant.

Zoey reaches out her hand to help Quinn off the couch.

                                                        17.

                        ZOEY

          Let's go.

                       JACK

          (looking at Quinn)

          I will call the state police in a fucking

          heart beat if she isn't here by midnight.

                       QUINN

          (still confused)

          OK?

Anna grabs the remote trying to ignore the situation.

                       ZOEY

          Anna, you going to call the guard dog

          off?

                       ANNA

          (out of it)

          David Smith's Candytakers is on tonight.

          I'm relaxing and not getting in the

          middle.

                       QUINN

          (To Jack and Anna)

          Nice meeting both of you.

                       JACK

          Get the fuck out.

                       ZOEY

          (to Jack and Anna)

          Don't wait up

Zoey and Quinn leave the apartment as Jack stares

daggers.

EXT. APARTMENT-CONTINUOUS

Zoey shuts the door and then turns to stop Quinn.

                       ZOEY

          Sorry about Jack...

                        QUINN

          I like him.

                                                      18.

INT. RESTAURANT-MOMENTS LATER

Zoey and Quinn are enjoying their meal at this fancy

upscale establishment. Quinn picks up his menu, running

his finger down though the menu items.

                       QUINN

          Zoey I would be more than happy to pay.

                       ZOEY

          No not at all. This is on me.

                       QUINN

          I can cover dessert at least.

                       ZOEY

          Listen Quinn, I'm an atheist-

                       QUINN

          -So you don't want dessert?-

                       ZOEY

          -No, I just wanted to get it out of the

          way. It bothers people, I mean in this

          state especially.

Quinn puts down the menu.

                       QUINN

          It doesn't bother me.

                        ZOEY

          Really?

                       QUINN

          I don't believe anyone is truly an

          atheist at the end.

                       ZOEY

          I'm pretty sure I'm really an atheist.

                        QUINN

          Why's that?

                       ZOEY

          Because I'm a logical thinker.

          (beat)

          I don't mean to offend, I'm guessing

          you're religious.

                       QUINN

          One supports the business they are in I

          guess.

                                           19.

             ZOEY

Oh my God you are in the ministry.

              QUINN

(smiles)

Kind of.

             ZOEY

My father was a "fire and damnation"

preacher. Baptist...He's...

              QUINN

He's?

             ZOEY

It's nothing.

(beat)

Sorry I don't mean to rock your world.

              QUINN

(smiles)

You didn't.

             ZOEY

You poor thing. You are probably so

desperate for friends-

              QUINN

(laughs)

What?

             ZOEY

Have you thought about St John's Wort?

             QUINN

You are a very cryptic speaker.

             ZOEY

No I'm thinking out loud mostly. I was

just...well...you have some social

awkwardness.

              QUINN

OK?

             ZOEY

Well you are latching on to religion to

make you feel whole. It doesn't make you

feel whole, or at least as whole as you

thought it would-

             QUINN

You are kind of right on that one.

                                                       20.

                        ZOEY

           So you are out with me...I represent

           everything you were brought up to combat.

           You're missing something and you are

           looking for help.

                        QUINN

           I am looking for help. I'm out with you

           though because I'm interested in getting

           to know you.

                        ZOEY

           (smiles)

           See I'm good at reading people.

                        QUINN

           (rolls eyes, smiles)

            Kind of.

                        ZOEY

           I don't know Quinn you seem like a lost

           soul. I thought that when I saw you by

           the river.

                        QUINN

           You like lost souls don't you?

                        ZOEY

           Yeah I actually do. Someone needs to save

           them.

                        QUINN

           You going to save me?

                        ZOEY

           If you let me.

                        QUINN

           I think you might be able to.

                        ZOEY

           (endearing smile)

           So what do you need Quinn?

                        QUINN

           (smiles)

           Dessert.

INT.   ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-LATER

Jack is passed out drooling on the couch. Anna and Zoey

are cross legged on the floor in the midst of "girl

talk".

                                                         21.

                       ANNA

          I don't know, he seems fishy.

                       ZOEY

          He seems harmless.

                       ANNA

          I have heard that a million times.

                       ZOEY

          I know. He's in the ministry-

                       ANNA

          -and you hate organized religion.

                       ZOEY

          I know and he's understanding of that.

                       ANNA

          Plus it's to my understanding he didn't

          actually admit what he did. He just did a

          bunch of double talk.

                       ZOEY

          It was understood.

                       ANNA

          Yeah again...not feeling confident in

          your choices. Please Zoey...

          (beat)...

          Be careful this time.

INT. QUINN'S ROOM-DAY

Quinn is sleeping in his bed. His room is rather bare,

with the exception of the basic living necessities. It

almost appears like a room at the "Y".

CLOSE UP-EDGE OF BED

A foot is seen kicking the bed, startling Quinn.

QUINN'S ROOM

Quinn flies out of bed and sees Louis leaning against the

wall with his arms crossed.

                       LOUIS

          Where were you last night?

                                                         22.

                       QUINN

          (getting his bearings)

          Out...thinking.

                       LOUIS

          You've done a lot of mopping and thinking

          over the centuries. It kind of brings me

          down.

                       QUINN

          So what do you need?

                          LOUIS

          Training.

EXT. OPEN FIELD-DAY

Louis and Quinn walk out into a huge open field. Louis is

carrying a black tote bag that he drops on the ground.

                       LOUIS

          Now this is a place for a climatic

          battle.

                          QUINN

          Not bad.

Quinn points at the bag

                       QUINN (CONT'D)

          What's in the bag?

                       LOUIS

          You will love this.

Louis goes to the tote bag and starts to unzip it.

                       LOUIS (CONT'D)

          I went to the toy store last night and

          picked these up.

He reaches into the bag and pulls out two "nurf" style

swords out.

                       LOUIS (CONT'D)

          Nothing like our real stuff, but it will

          do.

Louis throws one of the "swords" to Quinn.

                       QUINN

          (catching it)

          It's kind of lightweight..and silly.

                                                         23.

Louis comes over carrying his sword.

                       LOUIS

          Come on give it a chance.

Louis comes at Quinn and his instinct kicks in. The two

begin their mock battle.

TREE

From behind a tree we see RYAN BLOOD for the first time.

He hides in the shadows taking pictures with his digital

camera.

Quinn and Louis continue to practice unaware of the

unwanted attention.

INT. CAFE-DAY

Louis sips his coffee, while Quinn just stares out the

front window. It almost as if he is searching for

something.

                       LOUIS

          You have not been lively at all this go

          around.

                       QUINN

          A lot on my mind...

                       LOUIS

          We only do this once every seventy years

          brother. You have to enjoy it while it

          lasts.

                       QUINN

          Louis our whole purpose here, is to show

          up, and over time establish a social

          base, and then kill each other.

                       LOUIS

          You know and I'm very good at the social

          base part, and you are not so good...

                       QUINN

          That's because you find a way to screw it

          up every time.

                       LOUIS

          That's because, I know this is news to

          you, I represent evil.

                       (MORE)

                                                        24.

                       LOUIS (CONT'D)

          Here's the thing though, I'm tired Quinn.

          I really want to stop being the

          ambassador for this.

                       QUINN

          That's something we agree on. I'm tired

          too.

                       LOUIS

          I don't know if we can get off this

          train. It's just a viscous cycle.

                       QUINN

          Letting you win is not an option.

                       LOUIS

          I wasn't going there...

          (beat)

          ...yet.

INT. ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-EVENING

Quinn is sitting on the couch as Jack and Anna make their

way for the door.

                       ZOEY (O.S.)

          You guys leaving?

Zoey comes out of the kitchen with a bowl of popcorn.

                       JACK

          Yeah we don't want to interrupt your

          "date rape".

Anna hits Jack.

                       ANNA

          Jesus Jack! He can't do anything here

          anyway. Too much exposure. Witnesses my

          friend...We knew he was here.

Zoey sits down and hands the bowl to Quinn.

                       ZOEY

          Will you guys stop??

                       QUINN

          It's OK. I like your friends.

Anna walks over to the couch.

                       ANNA

          So Quinn?

                                                        25.

                        QUINN

          Yes?

                       ANNA

          Zoey says you are in the ministry?

                        QUINN

          Sort of.

                       ANNA

          You are or you aren't.

                       QUINN

          It's complicated.

                       ANNA

          At some point you will have to explain it

          to Zoey. I mean don't you agree?

                        QUINN

          Well...

                       ZOEY

          (put out)

           Will you guys leave??

Jack grabs Anna by the arm and leads her to the door.

                       JACK

          Who is going too far now?

                        ANNA

          "Date Rape"

                       ZOEY

          (trying to make a point)

          Bye guys!

Anna and Jack mumble as they head out the door.

                       ZOEY (CONT'D)

          (turning to Quinn)

          Sorry about that.

                       QUINN

          It's really OK.

EXT. APARTMENT-CONTINUOUS

Jack puts his arm around Anna, as to stop her for a

second.

                                                         26.

                       JACK

          You know I hate him because it's my

          nature but-

                       ANNA

          -You think I hate him because of my

          distrust of men?

                       JACK

          Tragedy changes people, it effected Zoey

          in one way...you in another.

                       ANNA

          Yeah

          (beat,smiles)

          I became a "fag hag"

                                                    BACK TO:

INT.ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-CONTINUOUS

Zoey is curled up next to Quinn on the couch. A popcorn

bowl is squeezed in between them. She reaches over and

picks up the remote.

                       ZOEY

          Tonight's Feature Presentation is "I am

          Curious:Yellow". Probably not the best

          date movie, but I always show this to

          ever guy in the beginning.

                       QUINN

          It's OK this will be my first film

          experience.

                        ZOEY

          What??

                       QUINN

          Yeah, I've never seen a film before. I

          mean I know of films, can't live in this

          world and not. I've just never seen one.

                       ZOEY

          This might be a little hard-core for your

          first film.

                       QUINN

          No it's OK. I'm excited.

Zoey shakes her head.

                                                        27.

                       ZOEY

          I feel like I'm stealing your virginity

          here.

Zoey slowly looks over at Quinn.

                       ZOEY (CONT'D)

          You're a virgin too aren't you?

Quinn shrugs

                       ZOEY (CONT'D)

          Oh my god! I'm a bad girl.

Quinn puts his hand on her shoulder.

                          QUINN

          (smiles)

          You are not.

Quinn motions to the TV.

                       QUINN (CONT'D)

          Please play the film.

                       ZOEY

          (hesitant)

          OK? I mean I usually play this for

          potential boyfriends. If they can handle

          this, they can handle me.

Zoey hits play on the remote.

                       ZOEY (CONT'D)

          I guess you're lucky I thought about

          "They Call Her One Eye".

          (to herself)

          I hope this doesn't jack you up.

                                             JUMP CUT TO:

TITLE CARD: 3 DAYS LEFT

EXT. OPEN FIELD-DAY

Quinn is sitting cross legged in the middle of the field.

He seems as though he is in the middle of a trance.

                       QUINN

          (monotone)

          I am curious Yellow...

Louis walks up and throws a toy sword on Quinn's lap.

                                                      28.

                       LOUIS

          What the hell are you talking about?

Quinn stands up and grabs the sword.

                       QUINN

          Nothing really.

The two start to sword fight, but Quinn does not have his

heart in it.

                       LOUIS

          You half asleep Quinn?

Quinn stops for a second and drops his sword down to his

side. Louis pokes Quinn in the chest with the tip of his

sword.

                       LOUIS (CONT'D)

          Look at that ladies and gentleman the

          apocalypse has begun.

Quinn sits down.

                       QUINN

          Have you ever seen a movie?

Louis follows his lead.

                       LOUIS

          I've seen plenty of movies.

                          QUINN

          Really?

                       LOUIS

          Yeah I watched "The Sorrow and The Pity"

          at Marshal the other day. You know people

          here have yet to figure out we are not

          students.

                       QUINN

          I think they have a pretty good idea.

                       LOUIS

          So in all the times we have been here,

          you haven't gone to the cinema?

                          QUINN

          No...

                          LOUIS

          Why not?

                                                         29.

                       QUINN

          It's not what we are here to do.

                       LOUIS

          In your bosses name, what is wrong with

          you? You've got to enjoy yourself. You

          might be chosen, but you have needs. We

          all do.

                       QUINN

          I have to stay focused.

                       LOUIS

          You've also burned yourself out. You're

          not going to be any good to me...

Louis gets up and reaches out to help Quinn

                       LOUIS (CONT'D)

          ...unless you take some "you" time.

Quinn takes Louis' hand and gets to his feet.

                       LOUIS (CONT'D)

          Can we get back to the matter at hand?

Louis brings his sword back up into attack position.

Quinn is back to his "swashbuckling" self. The two battle

it out on the field, matching each other blow for blow.

INT. RYAN BLOOD'S APARTMENT-LATER

We creep upon Ryan Blood as he works at his computer. On

closer inspection, it appears he is editing video of

Quinn and Louis' mock fight earlier in the day.

INT. LOUIS APARTMENT-CONTINUOUS

Louis' set up is more lavish than Quinn's. It's obvious

he indulges just a little too much.

Louis comes out of the bathroom with a towel around his

waist. He starts singing "Motown" songs to himself.

He walks back off screen to the bedroom. We still hear

him singing, as we pan around the apartment.

We swing back around to the entrance of Louis' bedroom.

He finally comes out fully dressed. He uses the towel he

was wearing to finish drying his hair.

He walks up to a mirror and starts looking at himself.

                                                         30.

LOUIS' POV

He starts to run his hands through his hair. He tries to

straighten up the mess on his head. He picks up some gel

and squirts a small amount in his hand.

He runs it through his hair, getting the desired look.

                          LOUIS

             (to himself)

             You are a handsome devil.

LOUIS APARTMENT

Louis spins around and grabs his keys off of the coffee

table. He then dances right out the door.

INT. QUINN'S ROOM-A FEW MOMENTS LATER

Louis walks into Quinn's room and finds him not there.

                          LOUIS

             (puzzled)

             Weird?

Louis walks out into...

HALLWAY

...the hallway. Ryan Blood is standing in the doorway of

his room, across the hall.

                          RYAN BLOOD

             You looking for Quinn?

Takes Louis' a second to register Ryan's question.

                          LOUIS

             Yes?

                          RYAN BLOOD

             (nodding toward the exit door)

             He just left.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING

Louis runs outside. He looks up and down the street. In

the distance he finally spots them, Quinn and Zoey

holding hands.

                                                      31.

                       LOUIS

          (to himself)

          What do we have here?

EXT. CAFE-MOMENTS LATER

Louis stands across the street, staring right into the

window of the cafe. He clearly sees Quinn and Zoey on a

date.

His eyes widen as their hands touch.

EXT. ZOEY'S APARTMENT BUILDING-LATER

Zoey and Quinn walk holding hands through the apartment

building parking lot. Zoey stops for a second and turns

to face Quinn.

                       ZOEY

          Why haven't I seen your place?

                       QUINN

          My place isn't very exciting.

                       ZOEY

          That doesn't surprise me. I can't imagine

          you having a vast Blu Ray collection.

                          QUINN

          Blu Ray?

                       ZOEY

          Wow...Quinn, you have to start enjoying

          the world around you.

                       QUINN

          You know I realized today you are right

          about that.

                       ZOEY

          So you're saying you want to come up

          stairs and watch "They Call Her One Eye"?

                       QUINN

          (laughs)

          Uh...no. I'm still trying to get I am

          Curious Yellow out of my head.

                       ZOEY

          Yeah...sorry about that...

                                                         32.

                         QUINN

          (smiles)

          It's OK.

Suddenly, guided by instinct, Zoey kisses Quinn on the

lips. Quinn is completely thrown.

                       ZOEY

          I...I..I'm sorry.

                         QUINN

          No don't be.

                       ZOEY

          I shouldn't have been that aggressive.

                       QUINN

          No...it's OK.

                         ZOEY

          OK?

                       QUINN

          I need to get back though.

                       ZOEY

          Puzzling...but I know...virgin and all-

                       QUINN

          -Well...I mean...

                       ZOEY

          That came out rude...I just mean...I

          wanted to do it. I should have taken it

          slower.

                       QUINN

          It's OK. I'll be by tomorrow.

                         ZOEY

          You sure?

                       QUINN

          Yes of course.

                         ZOEY

          (worried)

          I hope so.

Quinn slowly turns around and walks away. Zoey looks at

him like she is unsure if she will see him again.

                                                         33.

DUMPSTER

Meanwhile, leaning against the dumpster, Louis watches

the display unseen.

INT. RYAN BLOOD'S APARTMENT-LATER

Ryan is working at his PC when a KNOCK is heard. He gets

up from his messy desk and makes his way over to the

door.

As he swings it open we see Louis on the other side.

RYAN BLOOD'S APARTMENT- A FEW MOMENTS LATER

Ryan leans back in his desk chair. Louis has cleared off

a spot on a messy couch.

The apartment, simply put, is a "shithole"

                        RYAN BLOOD

           You're here to learn more about his

           "coming and goings". To find out what I

           have seen.

                        LOUIS

           So far you are dead on.

                        RYAN BLOOD

           It's more than that Louis-

                        LOUIS

           -You know who I am?

                        RYAN BLOOD

           I know pretty much everything. I've

           watched you, studied you...I feel I'm

           expert on your little game every seventy

           years.

                       LOUIS

           Really?

                       RYAN BLOOD

           Oh yes.

Ryan picks up a stack of documents and throws the papers

one at a time at Louis.

                        RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)

           You battled as mortals-

           (beat)

                        (MORE)

                                                       34.

                       RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)

          -You were a Lamanite then-

          (beat)

          -Quinn was a commander of the Nephites,

          last survivor of that nation-

           (beat)

          -The savoir spoke to him, showed him his

          future...his destiny-

          (beat)

          -See after the death of Christ there was

          some debate on what was going to bring on

          the end and signal his return-

          (beat)

          - It was decided two great warriors had

          to fight. The winner would determine the

          start of the apocalypse. Your boss of

          course needed someone to represent his

          interests. Who better than Quinn's old

          adversary?

Louis brushes the pile of papers of his lap.

                       LOUIS

          Where are you going with this you weird

          little man?

                       RYAN BLOOD

          You had strategy in the beginning. Middle

          Ages...Old West...Even World War II.

          (beat)

          Let's take a step back for a second. The

          Old West. Lack of faith, corruption,

          these things make Quinn weak. The chink

          in his armor is his faith in people. You

          knew that, and corrupting America...a

          young land...was the key.

          (beat)

          Quinn was a step ahead of you, and looked

          for a human ally. That ally was Joseph

          Smith, and Quinn...or I mean Moroni...led

          Joseph to the plates that later when into-

Ryan picks a book up and throws it at Louis. Louis looks

down at the "Book Of Mormon".

                       RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)

          -His little plan didn't work, but the

          book is a great coffee table discussion

          piece. This made him weak Louis. You

          could have destroyed him. The problem is

          you've allowed yourself to become fond of

          him. YOU need to embrace your destiny.

                       LOUIS

          How do I do that?

                                                      35.

                       RYAN BLOOD

          This girl is distracting him. Get his

          mind focused on the matter at hand. At

          this point I'm afraid he isn't even going

          to fight you.

                       LOUIS

          I'm surprised this girl even likes Quinn.

          He comes across creepy.

                       RYAN BLOOD

          Maybe that's the key-

                       LOUIS

          (lightbulb)

          -Make her think he's crazy.

INT. QUINN'S ROOM-MOMENTS LATER

Quinn opens the door to his room and spies a silhouette

in the far corner.

                       LOUIS

          Where have you been?

The silhouette comes out of the darkness and into view.

It should come to no surprise that Louis is emerging from

the darkness.

                       QUINN

          You've been waiting long?

                       LOUIS

          No I figured you were on your way back-

                       QUINN

          -because you are spying on me again? So I

          don't need to tell you where I've been.

Louis sits down on the edge of the bed.

                       LOUIS

          Who's the girl?

                       QUINN

          It's started again. You're already

          jealous. You are going to do the same

          thing you did during the war...you're

          going to sabotage this.

                       LOUIS

          I'm insulted frankly.

                                                      36.

                       QUINN

          Don't you play that game. You are being

          facetious.

                       LOUIS

          No, I'm being serious. You care about the

          girl, it's obvious. Not in a friendship

          or I'm curious about human behavior way.

Quinn sits down beside him.

                       QUINN

          So why are you here?

                       LOUIS

          Have you told her?

                       QUINN

          Who I am? Of course not!

                       LOUIS

          Quinn you only have a few days left and

          you care for this girl-

           (beat)

          - What's the harm in telling her?

                       QUINN

          There's a lot of harm in telling her.

                       LOUIS

          If this is real and you really care for

          this girl, you have to tell her. It's

          only fair to her.

                       QUINN

          She has a best friend who is very guarded

          of me...It's odd she eluded to the same

          thing. You know the whole "I'm hiding

          something, and I need to come out into

          the open" thing.

                       LOUIS

          Sounds to me like she is right.

Quinn gets up and walks to the door.

                       QUINN

          Well I better do this now then.

                       LOUIS

          Yeah you don't want to lose your nerve.

                       QUINN

          Can you let yourself out?

                                                      37.

                       LOUIS

          Of course.

Quinn slowly opens the door and walks out. The door

creeps shut behind him.

Louis smiles to himself, feeling satisfaction. His face

looks evil, almost demonic.

EXT. ZOEY'S APARTMENT BUILDING- SOMETIME LATER

In almost a "romantic movie" way, Quinn runs toward

Zoey's apartment. When he reaches the door he knocks like

his life depends on it.

Anna swings the door open, she's obviously surprised to

see Quinn.

                       ANNA

          What the hell?

You can hear Jack inside the apartment.

                       JACK (O.S.)

          What the fuck?!? I want to watch Bring me

          the Head of Alfredo Garcia in peace!

                       QUINN

          I need to see Zoey.

                       ANNA

          What about tomorrow? Or never is good.

You hear Zoey off screen.

                       ZOEY (O.S.)

          What's going on??

Zoey comes to the doorway and stands behind Anna.

                       ZOEY (CONT'D)

          Quinn? What's wrong?

                       QUINN

          I need to talk to you, it's important.

Quinn grabs her by the arm and pulls her outside, pushing

her right past Anna.

                       ANNA

          Jesus Christ!

Anna slams the door shut, leaving Zoey and Quinn outside.

                                                      38.

                       QUINN

          I need to tell you everything. Anna is so

          right.

                       ZOEY

          What are you talking about? Anna is

          right?

                       QUINN

          I've not been honest with you about what

          I do...or who I am.

                         ZOEY

          OK?

                       QUINN

          I need to come clean. I want you to trust

          me. I want your friends to trust me.

                       ZOEY

          (nervous laugh)

          OK Quinn, just spit it out.

                       QUINN

          OK

          (beat)

          I'm an archangel named Moroni and I

          basically represent "light" or everything

          that's good. Louis, my friend, represents

          "darkness". Every seventy years we have

          to fight to the death. If I win

          everything stays the way it is. The world

          continues turning. If I lose, Louis takes

          on the role of the Antichrist and the

          apocalypse will be unleashed. I'm talking

          Book of Revelations stuff here. So I only

          have a limited time left in this world...

          (beat)

          I want to spend that time with you.

Zoey is stunned, silent.

                         ZOEY

          Oh honey...

Zoey touches his face.

                       ZOEY (CONT'D)

          You must have a brain tumor or something.

          You're obviously mentally ill.

                         QUINN

          Zoey? I...

                                                        39.

Zoey puts her finger up to his lips to quiet him.

                        ZOEY

           Shhh. You need me more than ever.

Zoey reaches down and takes a confused Quinn's hand. She

leads him to the door. Like a sheep herder, she takes

Quinn inside of the apartment.

The last image we see is the apartment door slamming

behind them.

                                                    CUT TO:

DARKNESS

FLASHBACK-ZOEY'S HOME-YEARS EARLIER-DAY

Zoey, roughly 2 years old, sits in the floor of her

parent's home playing.

Her DAD, only seen from the waist down, walks in front of

Zoey with his bible in hand. He makes it to Zoey's MOM,

on the other side of the room

                        DAD

           You're not even helping me!

                        MOM

           I don't even know what you want!

                        DAD

           I can't run my congregation with this

           sickness!

                        MOM

           The sickness is in your head.

                        DAD

           You're too busy running around doing

           whatever you feel like. I'm going to fall

           apart and it's all on you.

FLASHBACK-ZOEY'S HOME-TEN YEARS LATER-DAY

Zoey, now 12, is going through some boxes in the closet.

Her head bumps a shelf and a box falls on her.

When she goes to pick up the box she finds a ton of VHS

tapes.

                                                        40.

She goes through the box looking at the labels: "Anna age

7" "Anna age 10" "Anna age 12".

FLASHBACK-ZOEY'S ROOM-A FEW MOMENTS LATER

The glow of Zoey's TV fills her face. We can neither see

nor hear what she is watching.

Zoey looks like she is about to throw up.

                                             JUMP CUT TO:

INT. ZOEY'S BEDROOM-PRESENT DAY-MORNING

Zoey jumps out of bed, like she is waking from a

nightmare. A startled Quinn, who was sleeping beside her,

starts to arouse.

                                             JUMP CUT TO:

TITLE CARD: 2 DAYS LEFT

INT. QUINN'S ROOM-MOMENTS LATER

Louis walks into Quinn's room with his black tote bag

from earlier. It's obvious he was meeting Quinn to go

train.

He looks through out the room, but quickly realizes Quinn

is probably with Zoey. He slumps down on Quinn's bed.

Anger and hurt is portrayed upon his face.

INT.CAFE-LATER

Quinn and Zoey are having coffee. It's obvious Zoey had a

rough night. She takes a sip of coffee, her mind is

distant.

                          QUINN

          Last night?

                          ZOEY

          Yes?

                          QUINN

          Did you?

                       ZOEY

          Enjoy myself? Of course.

                                                      41.

                       QUINN

          Based on how you are acting this morning

          I have my doubts. That's not what I meant

          though. You woke up screaming.

                       ZOEY

          It was nothing.

                       QUINN

          I understand if you don't want to talk

          about it. I'm just concerned.

                       ZOEY

          It's not a big deal. It was...a...well

          wouldn't call it a nightmare...repressed

          memory. Hell, it's not repressed...I

          think of it all the time.

                          QUINN

          What is it?

                       ZOEY

          You don't want to hear about it.

Quinn touches her hand.

                          QUINN

          Please?

Zoey takes a deep breath.

                       ZOEY

          My father, I mentioned him before, was a

          Baptist minister. He always said he had

          this "sickness". He begged my mom for

          help, it was more important though for

          her to having shopping and dinner dates

          with her girlfriends. Anna, my friend

          that "loves you", has been in my life

          since I was tiny. She used to come over

          all the time. My Dad adored her. When I

          was around twelve I found something in

          the closet...tapes. My Dad and Anna from

          the time she was like seven...He...

          (starts tearing up)

          I showed my Mom, and Dad...well he got

          out of prison when I was seventeen. I

          don't see him anymore. His church, even

          though they knew he had a problem

          disowned him. He wouldn't have done that

          to Anna if my mom would have supported

          him, got him help.

                                                         42.

                       QUINN

          Who do you think is to blame?

                       ZOEY

          He tried to get help Quinn, he reached

          out to my Mom. I should have protected

          Anna too...I mean-

                       QUINN

          -None of this was your fault.

                       ZOEY

          I have to protect people. This was out of

          my control, you Quinn...What's going on

          with you...I have control of that.

Quinn looks at Zoey. He loves her, but a part of him

pities her too.

EXT. PARK-RIVERSIDE-LATER

Zoey is curled up under Quinn's arm as they sit on the

same bench from earlier. Quinn stares out toward the

river. It's obvious he is pondering over his choices.

                       QUINN

          I love being with you.

                       ZOEY

          Me too.

                       QUINN

          I can't renege on my responsibilities

          with Louis though.

Zoey sits up.

                       ZOEY

          You're not actually going to fight your

          friend to the death are you?

                       QUINN

          I know you don't understand this. We just

          need to make the most of our time.

                       ZOEY

          Quinn, in 2 days things are going to be

          normal. This is just a delusion.

                       QUINN

          I know you don't understand. I just need

          to go see Louis today.

                                                         43.

                       ZOEY

          I understand that.

Quinn leans his head back. He catches something out of

the corner of his eye.

QUINN'S POV

Quinn sees Ryan Blood hiding behind a tree. He is taking

video of Quinn and Zoey with a "smart phone".

PARK-RIVERSIDE

Quinn jolts up. Zoey is alarmed.

                        ZOEY

          What is it?

Quinn doesn't answer. He gets up and runs to the...

TREE

Quinn looks behind the tree, but Ryan is long gone. Zoey

comes up from behind, she places her hand on Quinn's

shoulder.

                       ZOEY

          What was wrong?

                       QUINN

          My neighbor Ryan Blood...looks like he's

          spying on me.

                       ZOEY

          What are you talking about?

                       QUINN

          I need to go see Louis.

INT. RYAN BLOOD'S APARTMENT-LATER

Louis is watching the video on the smart phone. He's seen

enough, he throws it back to Ryan.

Louis tosses trash off the couch so he can sit down.

                       LOUIS

          (sitting down)

          I thought him admitting his true self

          would break them up-

                                                        44.

Ryan plops down in his computer desk chair.

                         RYAN BLOOD

            -Instead he is still hot and heavy with

            her.

            (beat)

            He even did the "bipty boom" last night.

                         LOUIS

            The fight is pointless.

                         RYAN BLOOD

            It's not pointless. The game has just

            changed is all.

             (beat)

            We have two levels here: one is making

            sure we keep him engaged.

            (beat)

            Honestly though that's an afterthought at

            this point-

                         LOUIS

            So what's the next move?

Ryan reaches into his desk drawer.

                         RYAN BLOOD

            (still searching)

            Well when he does become engaged...

Ryan throws something at Louis.

LOUIS POV

Louis catches the item. He looks down to see a nine

millimeter.

                         RYAN BLOOD (O.S.) (CONT'D)

            ...We need to make sure you still have

            the advantage.

INT. ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-LATER

Zoey is pacing back and forth. Jack rubs his face in

frustration. He is tired of watching Zoey tear herself up

over this guy.

Anna tries to step into Zoey's path attempting to get her

attention

                         ANNA

            What are you doing?

                                                      45.

Zoey is jittery, she can't handle Anna blocking her way.

                       ZOEY

          I haven't heard from Quinn since he

          wigged out today.

                       ANNA

          Well honestly maybe that's a good thing.

                         ZOEY

          He needs me.

                       ANNA

          He doesn't need you! Not everyone needs

          you!

                       ZOEY

          (frustrated)

          This isn't about me and you-

                       ANNA

          -This is about me and you! You think you

          can make up for what happened. The fact

          you didn't notice, couldn't save me in

          time. You were a child! I was a child!

          You couldn't have saved your father

          either! Your mother couldn't have, no one

          could have! He was a fucking pedophile!

Zoey slaps Anna across the face.

                       ANNA (CONT'D)

          Hate me all you want, but it's impossible

          to redeem yourself for things you had no

          control over.

Jack is sick and tired of this display.

                       JACK

          Just show her the fucking file.

Jack gets up.

                       ZOEY

          (confused)

          What fucking file?

EXT. LOUIS APARTMENT-CONTINUOUS

Quinn runs toward Louis' apartment. His KNOCKS sound like

a jackhammer on the door.

Louis answers.

                                                       46.

                        QUINN

           We have a problem.

                        LOUIS

           You're right. We do.

Louis moves slightly and we see Ryan Blood in the

background.

Louis slowly closes the door in a stunned Quinn's face.

INT. LOUIS APARTMENT

Louis turns toward Ryan.

                        LOUIS

           I thought coming here would give us some

           privacy from Quinn.

                        RYAN BLOOD

           I think it worked out perfectly.

INT. ZOEY'S APARTMENT BUILDING-CONTINUOUS

Jack walks into the room holding a file folder. Zoey is

sitting on the couch trying to get a grip.

Jack throws the file in her lap.

                        ZOEY

           So is the file folder for dramatic

           effect?

                        JACK

           No it was to keep everything organized...

           (beat)

           ...and for dramatic effect.

Suddenly Zoey's cell phon rings.

She sets the folder aside and answers.

                       ZOEY

           Quinn?

INTERCUT

EXT. STREET CORNER

Quinn is on a pay phone, he's shaking. At this point he

is lost on what his next move should be.

                                                      47.

                        QUINN

          Ryan Blood!

                       ZOEY

          You mentioned that earlier. What is going

          on?

                       QUINN

          He's with Louis. They're planning to kill

          me.

                       ZOEY

          I thought that was the whole plan.

                       QUINN

          No it's...this isn't like Louis. I think

          he is trying to cheat his way to a win.

                       ZOEY

          Why don't you come over here.

                        QUINN

          I can't!

                       ZOEY

          Come on Quinn get a grip. Just calm down

          and come over here.

                       QUINN

          You're right.

                       ZOEY

          OK so just come on over and we'll talk.

                       QUINN

          No I mean you're right. I need to get

          control of myself. I have a destiny. I

          need to figure out my next move.

                       ZOEY

          Quinn? No wait-

Quinn hangs up the phone.

ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT

Zoey slowly drops her cell phone to the floor. Jack picks

up the folder Zoey set aside.

                        JACK

          What is it?

                                                       48.

                       ZOEY

          I don't know. He's losing it.

Jack hands her the folder.

                       JACK

          You need to look at this.

Zoey takes the folder from him and starts reading.

                       JACK (CONT'D)

          I spent a lot of time gathering that

          information.

                       ZOEY

          So what is all this?

                       JACK

          Quinn Wilson and Louis Marks were

          orphans.

Zoey is flipping through documents.

                       JACK (CONT'D)

          Quinn displayed some erratic behavior

          from the beginning. One of the staff

          members was Mormon and they would read

          stories to Quinn out of the Book Of

          Mormon. That employee was later fired,

          but a seed was planted in Quinn's head.

          He kept going on about how he and Louis

          were meant to fight to the death. Some of

          the children at the time claim Louis

          would encourage this behavior. He

          probably thought this was Quinn's attempt

          at playing.

          (beat)

          As things continued the staff at the

          orphanage thought Quinn needed help

          beyond what they could offer. They sent

          Quinn to a hospital.

Zoey puts the folder down, the documents fall to the

floor.

                       ZOEY

          You're not telling me anything I didn't

          already know.

                       ANNA

          That makes it worse. You're going to

          continue this now that you know for a

          fact that he is nuts?

                                                         49.

                       ZOEY

          I'm too far into this now. I don't have a

          choice.

Zoey picks the documents up and places them in the

folder. She then tosses the folder on the coffee table.

                       JACK

          Why don't you let us save you? Please

          Zoey.

                       ZOEY

          Let me be guys.

Zoey walks to her bedroom, leaving Anna and Jack

exhausted.

ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-EARLY MORNING

The apartment is quiet. Anna no where in sight, more than

likely in her room sleeping.

Jack is passed out on the couch. Zoey walks in, it's

obvious she hasn't slept all night.

She scoots Jack's legs over and sits on the couch. She

proceeds to pick up the file folder.

She starts thumbing through the documents. After a few

moments she finds one of interest.

She reaches over and pushes Jack.

                       JACK

          (rousing up)

          Ehhh...what? You better be a hot bear of

          a man.

Jack looks up and sees Zoey.

                       JACK (CONT'D)

          Or Zoey...What do you need hun?

Zoey hands Jack a document from the folder.

                         ZOEY

          What's this?

Jack's eyes try to focus on the document.

                       JACK

          Looks like a room list from the psych

          hospital.

                                                        50.

                       ZOEY

          I gathered that. Under Quinn's room...

                       JACK

          Quinn and his roommate is listed.

                       ZOEY

          Quinn's roommate was Ryan Blood?

                       JACK

          Yeah...looks that way.

                         ZOEY

          Ah fuck.

                                              JUMP CUT TO:

TITLE CARD: 1 DAY LEFT

EXT. OPEN FIELD-DAY

Louis stares out into the open field. A gust of wind

blows through his hair.

Ryan Blood comes up from behind and pats Louis on the

back.

                       RYAN BLOOD

          We need to talk.

Louis turns around to face Ryan.

                         LOUIS

          About?

                         RYAN BLOOD

          Strategy.

                         LOUIS

          Strategy?

                       RYAN BLOOD

          Yes. I have a method-

                       LOUIS

          -I have to hear this.

                       RYAN BLOOD

          A 12 point system-

                       LOUIS

          (confused)

          - Like 12 steps?

                                                      51.

                       RYAN BLOOD

          Exactly. It's a sure fire plan to throw

          Quinn off of his game

Louis laughs.

                       LOUIS

          Oh I am so all ears.

                       RYAN BLOOD

          Well the first thing you need is a battle

          cry.

                       LOUIS

          Excuse me? A battle cry?

                       RYAN BLOOD

          Yes a battle cry. Every great warrior has

          one.

                       LOUIS

          And a battle cry is going to give me the

          advantage in battle?

                       RYAN BLOOD

          Of course it will. Why don't you try one

          out?

                       LOUIS

          What?

                       RYAN BLOOD

          Yeah, try one out right now. It's

          liberating.

                       LOUIS

          I'd rather not.

                       RYAN BLOOD

          Come on.

                       LOUIS

          (extremely confused)

          Right here?

                       RYAN BLOOD

          Here I'll go first-

Ryan let's out a scream that sounds as though he is being

sodomized.

                       LOUIS

          That was...interesting.

                                                        52.

                          RYAN BLOOD

          See?

           (beat)

          Your turn.

Louis looks around.

                       LOUIS

          So right now?

                          RYAN BLOOD

          Of course.

Louis inhales deeply and then lets out a scream. It comes

out more like frightened little girl.

                       RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)

          Oh come on! That sounds like you are

          scared of the battle. What? Are you

          scared of Quinn? You probably are-

Louis lets out another scream, this one is slightly

better.

                       RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)

          That's good! Come on!

Louis lets out another one that actually causes Ryan to

jump back.

                       RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)

          Yes that's what I'm talking about!

Out of nowhere, Quinn walks up to the two of them.

                       RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)

          (noticing Quinn)

           Quinn?!? Good to see you!

Quinn grabs Louis' arm.

                       QUINN

          We need to talk.

                       LOUIS

          (to Ryan)

          Excuse me for a second.

Louis walks with Quinn to a spot that gives them some

distance away from Ryan.

                       QUINN

          I know that guy and I don't trust him.

                                                      53.

                       LOUIS

          I don't trust you anymore.

                       QUINN

          Your new friend is dangerous.

                         LOUIS

          So is yours.

                       QUINN

          Leave her out of this.

                       LOUIS

          You fighting tomorrow morning Quinn?

                       QUINN

          It's over. This whole thing is nuts. I'm

          walking away.

                       LOUIS

          Let me walk away from you first then.

Louis starts to walk away from Quinn. He turns around as

he continues to walk backwards.

                       LOUIS (CONT'D)

          I'm coming at you! You are in this game

          like it or not!

EXT. ORPHANAGE-DAY

Zoey's car pulls up in front of an historic brick

building. She slowly gets out and starts to look the

structure over. It's almost like she is trying to assess

if she has the right place.

INT. ORPHANAGE-CONTINUOUS

A awkward young man, JAKE, is sorting through boxes. He's

kneeled on the floor organizing a mess of files. Zoey

walks up and tries to attract his attention.

                         ZOEY

          Excuse me?

Jake comes out of his world of file sorting. He looks up

at Zoey.

                         JAKE

          (monotone)

           Yes.

                                                         54.

Jake stands.

                       ZOEY

          I'm looking for Mrs. Rhodes. I believe

          the people here referred to her as

          "mother".

                       JAKE

          (monotone)

           People look for a lot of things.

Zoey is confused.

                       ZOEY

          I'm sure they do.

           (looking at the boxes)

          You guys shutting down?

                       JAKE

          (monotone)

           We are ceasing operations.

                       ZOEY

          Is there something wrong with you?

MRS. RHODES, a 60 year old odd looking lady, comes out of

the back.

                       MRS. RHODES

          Calm down. You need to calm down and

          count to ten.

                       ZOEY

          What? I don't know what that means.

Mrs. Rhodes starts waving her hands at Zoey. She flaps

them up and down in her face.

                       MRS. RHODES

          You have to calm down and meditate.

                       ZOEY

          Um...no...listen do you know Quinn Wilson

          and Louis Marks? They grew up here.

Mrs. Rhodes steps back like a vampire who has just seen a

cross.

                       MRS. RHODES

          No...You need to leave!

                       ZOEY

          What?

                                                      55.

                       MRS. RHODES

          And give me your shirt.

                       ZOEY

          Um...no.

Zoey turns around and starts to leave. Mrs. Rhodes starts

screaming at the top of her lungs.

                       MRS. RHODES

          You better make your peace with God girl!

          The end is coming, those boys are

          ushering in a new era!

Zoey runs down the hallway toward the front door.

EXT. ORPHANAGE

Zoey runs outside and makes it to her car. She hits the

roof of her vehicle in anger

                       ZOEY

          What a fucking nut house!

                       JAKE (O.S.)

          (monotone)

          Excuse me!

Zoey jumps up and screams. She sees Jake standing

creepily behind her.

                       ZOEY

          What!

                       JAKE

          (monotone)

          I know the young boys you speak of.

                       ZOEY

          (doesn't care)

          And?

                       JAKE

          (monotone)

          I was here when Quinn got sent to the

          mental hospital. It was like the other

          one set it up.

                       ZOEY

          Wait Louis? You think Louis made Quinn

          appear crazy?

                                                         56.

                        JAKE

           (monotone)

           They both believed the same thing. Louis

           was just smart enough to hide it.

                        ZOEY

           There is more to it than that.

                        JAKE

           (monotone)

           I don't understand

                        ZOEY

           Listen "Robot Boy", where did this whole

           belief come from? This isn't something

           two kids come up with on their own.

                        JAKE

           (monotone)

           Yes I believe a seed was planted.

                        ZOEY

           Exactly. I heard there was an employee

           that got fired for sharing Mormon

           mythology with the boys.

                        JAKE

           (monotone)

           No. Off base. He's not the right one.

INTERCUT

INT. ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT- A FEW MOMENTS LATER

Jack sits at the PC while chatting away on his cell

phone. It appears he is looking up information for who

ever is on the other end.

INT.ZOEY'S CAR- CONTINUOUS

Zoey is parked in a parking lot, while she chats on her

cell phone with Jack.

                        JACK

           You might be right sweetheart. The

           employee I was telling you about earlier

           was instrumental in getting Appleridge

           Orphanage shut down.

                       ZOEY

           How?

                                            57.

             JACK

Mrs. Rhodes was pretty well known in

Huntington. I think she felt this guy was

getting in the way of her master plan.

Finally, nearly 20 years later, he

convinced the state what was really going

on there.

             ZOEY

Well...elaborate.

             JACK

That girl you talked to was "pants

crapping nuts". She actually makes your

boyfriend look sane. I guess she believes

that Lucifer came to her in a vision-

             ZOEY

-How is that different than a dream? Just

saying-

             JACK

-I don't know. I think you have to be

awake for a vision.

(beat)

Will you please pay attention? Anyway he,

meaning Lucifer, gave her this jazz

about...well you know the story. Two

angels, fighting to the

death...blah...blah...Anyway he told her

she needed to look after Louis and get

Quinn out of there. I guess trying to

stack the odds in Louis' favor.

             ZOEY

So she had Quinn committed?

             JACK

To the same hospital where her nephew was

a patient. All on the dark lord's orders

I guess.

             ZOEY

Fucking Ryan Blood!

             JACK

Your friends are fucking whack.

               ZOEY

Thanks Jack.

             JACK

So what are you going to do?

                                                         58.

                       ZOEY

          I'm going to stop an Apocalyptic battle.

                       JACK

          Goddamn Zoey!

ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT

Jack realizes Zoey hung up on him. He slowly puts his

phone down and steps away from the computer.

He walks over to the couch and sits down. He lets out a

sigh of exhaustion as he leans back on the couch.

ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-A FEW HOURS LATER

Jack is now sprawled out on the couch. Anna walks in the

room and sets a beverage on the coffee table in front of

him.

She moves his legs and sits down beside of him.

                       ANNA

          So where is she at now?

Jack sits up.

                       JACK

          I got a text about thirty minutes ago.

          I'm pretty sure she is going to head to

          Quinn's apartment.

                       ANNA

          Jack...

                       JACK

          What?

                       ANNA

          Her Christ Complex is going to get her

          killed.

                       JACK

          Trust me I know Anna.

          (beat)

          I know...

KNOCKING is heard at the door. Anna gets up to answer.

                       JACK (CONT'D)

          Maybe it's Quinn the jackass.

                                                      59.

Anna just gets the door opened a crack when...

Ryan and Louis BURST into the room. Anna SCREAMS. Louis

restrains her against a wall.

Jack gets up from the couch, but he meets a gun handle to

the head from Ryan.

                       RYAN BLOOD

          Good afternoon boys and girls! I need

          your assistance.

INT. QUINN'S ROOM-MOMENTS LATER

Quinn walks into his room. To his surprise, Zoey is

sitting on his bed. It appears she has been there for a

while.

                       QUINN

          How do people keep ending up in my room?

                       ZOEY

          (laughs)

          You need to learn to lock up.

Quinn walks over and sits on the bed beside her.

                       QUINN

          I'm not fighting Louis.

                       ZOEY

          Why the change of heart?

                       QUINN

          I think you might be right. I don't think

          it's necessary. I think the world will

          keep turning one way or another. I'm not

          dependant on that.

           (beat)

          I'm not a savior.

                       ZOEY

          Do you really believe? You know?

                       QUINN

          Yes. I do believe it. I know it actually.

          Since I have been with you, I've doubted

          what I know to be fact though. Then it

          hit me, it really doesn't matter.

                       ZOEY

          I'll help you Quinn. I don't want to do

          it for myself...

                       (MORE)

                                                         60.

                       ZOEY (CONT'D)

          I don't want to do it because I feel I

          have to. Obligations, or dark incidents

          from my past...That's not a reason to

          help anyone. It makes me fucking selfish

          actually.

                       QUINN

          You're not selfish Zoey.

                       ZOEY

          I care about you Quinn. That's sincerely

          my reason for wanting to do this. That's

          a first for me you know?

                         QUINN

          I know...

Quinn hugs her and they slowly lay down on the bed

together.

                                             JUMP CUT TO:

QUINN'S ROOM- LATER

Quinn gets pistol whipped across the face. Suddenly we

see Louis picking Zoey up by the hair.

                         QUINN

          (in pain)

           Let her go!

Louis has a hold of Zoey. Quinn gets up and goes for

Ryan.

Louis drop kicks Quinn and sends him flying across the

room.

Louis throws Zoey at Ryan. Ryan then holds her at gun

point.

                       RYAN BLOOD

          (looking at Quinn)

          Let me pretty the girl up a bit

Ryan beats her repeatedly with the gun until she passes

out cold from the trauma.

Quinn tries to get to his feet, but Louis kicks him back

down.

                       LOUIS

          Hold on sunshine!

                                                           61.

Ryan throws Louis the gun.

QUINN'S POV

We see Louis with great force repeatedly hit Quinn with

the gun. Everything goes fuzzy and then we...

                                                       CUT TO:

BLACKNESS

INT. QUINN'S ROOM-HOURS LATER

Quinn slowly gets to his feet. He walks over to the

doorway and kneels down.

He sees a puddle of blood...Zoey's blood. He puts his

fingers in it. He inspects his hand, rubbing the blood

between his index finger and thumb.

He jumps up and screams in anger. That would be Quinn's

version of a battle cry.

CLOSE SHOT-JACK'S FACE

A hand rips duct tape off of Jack's mouth. He let's out a

loud scream.

                         JACK

            Mother fucker!

INT. ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT- CONTINOUS

Quinn crouches down beside Jack.

Jack and Anna are both tied up, Anna still has duct tape

across her mouth. You can hear her muffled screams as

they fill the room.

                         QUINN

            Where's Zoey?

                         JACK

            Fuck you mother fucker! I'm going to call

            the fucking fuzz once you untie me!

            Fucking nut bag, ball sac-

                         QUINN

            (like he is talking to a retarded child)

            I...will...come...rescue...you

                                                         62.

                       JACK

          Ass fuck salad-

Quinn puts the duct tape back on Jack's mouth. Even

though we can't make out what he is saying, he is still

running off at the mouth.

                       QUINN

          That actually felt kind of good.

Quinn pats Jack on the head.

                       QUINN (CONT'D)

          I'll be back guys.

Quinn leaves the room. Muffled cursing can be heard

through out the apartment.

CLOSE SHOT-QUINN'S BED

A long black box is pulled out from under Quinn's bed. We

see Quinn's hands unlatch and then open it.

Inside we see Quinn's katana. His hand grips the hilt.

INT. QUINN'S ROOM

Quinn gets up, holding his katana and ready for a fight.

He's dressed in a black biker jacket, kind of looking

like the Bride from Kill Bill.

He walks to the doorway. He stands still for a second.

He's preparing his next move.

Bad ass comic book pose...'nuff said.

INT. CHURCH

The front doors to the church swing open. Light fills the

sanctuary. Zoey walks through the doors.

She heads toward the alter and sees a man, in his 50's,

kneeling. It appears he might be praying.

                                                         63.

She places her hand on his shoulder. As he turns around

she sees her Dad.

                       ZOEY

          I'm not doing it anymore. You will not

          have redemption from me.

           Zoey...

He reaches for her, she pulls away. She starts to back

up.

                       ZOEY

          Take ownership of what you did. Don't

          rely on me to save you. I need to start

          saving myself.

She slowly backs up and then turns to walk away.

EXT. OPEN FIELD-DAY

Ryan pulls Zoey up to her feet. He presses the gun

against her head.

Louis walks out into the middle of the field. He's

dressed in a full ninja outfit.

He unsheathes his katana.

                       LOUIS

          What do you think Zoey? I'm a ninja!

                       ZOEY

          You're fucking crazy!

That's not nice! I think I look good.

             ZOEY

I think you're a fucking nut bag.

This is going to be fun. You'll see.

Mrs Rhodes? Does that name ring a bell?

My aunt?

             LOUIS

Yeah...yeah...she played a part in the

game. Tell us something we don't know.

You're such a sexy Nancy Drew right now.

             ZOEY

Go fuck yourself.

             LOUIS

Or a foul mouthed Velma. That gets me so

hard. Does that get you hard Ryan?

             RYAN BLOOD

Can we go back to my aunt please?

             ZOEY

Mrs. Rhodes? What about her? Other than

she fucked you guys up. She taught you,

Louis how to play it straight. Then she

has you fuck Quinn over.

             RYAN BLOOD

She didn't fuck Quinn over. She just

helped him out.

             ZOEY

Yeah by getting him in contact with you.

             RYAN BLOOD

She knew one day it was all going to

catch up with her. She trained me to get

into the game. She told me it was my

destiny.

             ZOEY

Is that why she placed you in that

hospital?

                                                         65.

                       RYAN BLOOD

          She was my caretaker. She told me she was

          sending me someone. Someone I would have

          to guide on to the right path.

                       ZOEY

          Guys I have let my parents fuck me up.

          There comes a time though where you have

          to go out on your own. Take

          responsibility for your own life.

                       RYAN BLOOD

          There is a much bigger purpose. You'll

          see.

                       ZOEY

          This whole thing was to carry out some

          delusional woman's master plan. She

          doesn't even remember who she is at this

          point. I went to see her...she wanted me

          to take off my shirt.

Louis is irritated.

None of this makes sense.

             LOUIS

Lady, it would look weird if we roamed

the earth for 5000 years without facing a

mortal death! We keep getting reborn,

sometimes we even switch physical form.

Thanks for coming to the game late missy!

             ZOEY

That makes total fucking sense. Color me

stupid!

             QUINN

(to Louis)

 You don't get it do you.

             LOUIS

What?!?

             QUINN

If you win...you're not becoming the

antichrist.

             LOUIS

What are you talking about??

              QUINN

It's   Ryan...it's always been Ryan.

             LOUIS

(To Ryan)

What is he talking about?

                                                      67.

                       RYAN BLOOD

          He's pitting us against each other.

                       QUINN

          I'm going to be honest with you Louis.

          I've always been honest.

                       LOUIS

          Yeah sometimes to a fault.

                       QUINN

          We have always played this game as honest

          as we could. We never did anything to

          undermine the other. Despite what you

          represent, you have moral code.

          (beat)

          You are not acting with in that code

          today.

                       LOUIS

          I'm tired of losing...

                       QUINN

          You're losing right now. Your actions,

          you can't win like this. Not acting this

          way.

                       LOUIS

          I'm tired of you. I'm going to end it!

Louis goes over to Ryan. He trades his sword in for

Ryan's gun.

Ryan holds the katana to Zoey's throat. Louis points the

gun dead at Quinn.

                       QUINN

          You going to shoot me?

                       LOUIS

          It's the endgame.

Tense moment as Louis aims the gun at Quinn.

SUDDENLY he spins and shoots Ryan dead in the head.

Ryan falls and Zoey gets free.

Louis looks at Quinn and then throws the gun far out into

the field.

                       LOUIS (CONT'D)

          OK...I guess I do have some morals.

                                                        68.

Zoey gets her bearings.

                       ZOEY

          What the fuck!

                       QUINN

          Zoey go home. We need to finish this.

Louis walks over to Ryan and grabs his katana.

                       ZOEY

          No you don't. Guys what are you doing?

                       LOUIS

          Go home girl!

                       ZOEY

          Are you being serious?

Quinn stops and turns toward Zoey.

                       QUINN

          I will always love you. You have to go

          though.

                       ZOEY

          If you don't walk away from this field

          right now, you will lose me. I will not

          be in your corner. I will call for help.

          They will stop you.

                          QUINN

          Go...

                       ZOEY

          Quinn...last chance.

Zoey walks over to Ryan's body. She searches till she

finds her cell phone in his front pocket.

                       ZOEY (CONT'D)

          I will call the police Quinn...

Quinn looks at Zoey, dead in the eyes.

                          QUINN

          Goodbye.

Quinn turns toward Louis. He pulls his katana up to

attack position and Louis follows suit.

                       ZOEY

          (tearing up)

          Wow...yeah goodbye.

                                                        69.

Quinn and Louis charge each other. Zoey doesn't bother to

stay to watch the battle. She slowly walks away.

Quinn and Louis' swords meet. The clang is triumphant.

Details of this climatic battle will be choreographed by

the actors involved, but think high flying Shaw Brothers

film.

We don't see a clear victor, just the two boys going at

it until we can't tell who is who.

OTHER SIDE OF THE FIELD-AWAY FROM THE BATTLE

Zoey starts to make a call on her cell phone.

CLOSE SHOT-CELL PHONE

She starts to dial 911. Her thumb moves in the position

to hit send.

OTHER SIDE OF THE FIELD

Zoey stops. She slowly puts her phone away. She looks

back toward where the battle is going on.

She starts to walk back. The walk turns into a jog.

Finally the jog turns into a full run.

OPEN FIELD

When she gets to the field Quinn and Louis are gone. All

that can be seen is Ryan Blood's body, two katanas and an

empty ninja suit.

Zoey leans down and touches Quinn's katana.

                          ZOEY

             (laughs to herself)

             I am Curious:Yellow

             (beat)

             Goodbye boys...

Zoey stares out into the open field. She feels reborn.

She knows there is a new world, a new perspective for her

beyond the horizon.

                                                  CUT TO:

TITLE CARD: 70 YEARS LATER

                                                        70.

INT. UNIVERSITY CONFERANCE HALL

The camera slowly pans toward an older ninety year old

Zoey. She's behind a podium, there is a sign on the front

that reads: Marshal University Association of Free

Thought.

                       ZOEY

          For years we have thought absence of the

          impossible indicated that we were

          exercising free thought. In my experience

          ladies and gentleman, that's not the

          case.

          (beat)

          Believing in hope my friends, opening

          yourself up to accepting there might be

          more than the world around you. That's

          truly being a free thinker.

The camera ends with a close shot on Zoey's face.

EXT. PARK-RIVERSIDE-LATER

Zoey sits on the same bench where she met Quinn. Her

great-granddaughter, JENNIFER walks up. She sits down

beside her grandmother.

                         JENNIFER

          Hey Grandma.

                         ZOEY

          Hey...

                       JENNIFER

          You look solemn.

                       ZOEY

          Just sitting here...thinking...

                       JENNIFER

          What are you thinking about?

                       ZOEY

          I've had a great life. A wonderful

          husband, children, grandchildren...

          (motions to Jennifer)

          ...great grandchildren...I spent so much

          of my youth being angry. I wish I could

          relive my life now, knowing what I know.

                       JENNIFER

          You do have a lot of wisdom.

                                                         71.

                       ZOEY

          I've tried to pass it on to you.

                       JENNIFER

          You've taught me a lot.

                       ZOEY

          Just remember, you can believe what you

          want to believe Jennifer. Live by what

          ever moral code you want to live by. Just

          make sure it's yours. Don't let it stem

          from anger or past tragedies.

          (beat)

          Let it come from your heart.

Jennifer turns around.

                         ZOEY (CONT'D)

          What is it?

                       JENNIFER

          My new boyfriend. The one I wanted you to

          meet.

Zoey turns around to see the BOYFRIEND walking toward

them. It shouldn't come to a surprise that he looks a lot

like Quinn.

Jennifer gets up and grabs her boyfriend around the

waist. He reaches his hand out to Zoey.

                       BOYFRIEND

          (nervous)

          Nice to meet to ma'am.

                       ZOEY

          (shakes his hand)

          Likewise.

Jennifer grabs his hand right after his handshake with

Zoey.

                       JENNIFER

          We better get going. We're going to grab

          something to eat.

                       ZOEY

          (to the boyfriend)

          I didn't catch your name.

                       BOYFRIEND

          I'm so sorry. I'm being rude.

                                                         72.

                       JENNIFER

          (laughs)

          He can be like that.

                          BOYFRIEND

          I'm Louis.

Zoey is stunned.

                          JENNIFER

          (to Zoey)

          You OK?

                       ZOEY

          Yeah I'm fine.

          (snapping out of it)

           Enjoy dinner.

                       JENNIFER

          See you later on.

                       BOYFRIEND

          (making eye contact with Zoey, smiling)

          Nice to meet you.

                       ZOEY

          (returning contact, and smiles)

          Likewise.

The two lovebirds walk away. Zoey stares at them for a

second. A it "can't be look" crosses her face.

START "DONE AND DUSTED'

CLOSE UP-ZOEY'S FACE

Zoey smiles almost to say to the camera that there is

more out there. Things that we don't fully understand.

The smile then fades.

Her final look is that of content. And then as Done and

Dusted plays we...

                                                FADE OUT.

                       THE END
