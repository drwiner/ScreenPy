EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - DUSK

     It's finally happened.  Hell's frozen over.

     Christmas is two weeks off, arid SNOW is falling in Gotham.

     Beneath its pristine white blanket, the city looks

     uncharacteristically serene -- almost 

inviting

.  Peace has

     been miraculously restored: strangers wave hello.  Salvation

     Army Santas ring their bells on streetcorners.  And now, as

     night falls, an ILLUMINATED SIGN winks on above Broad Avenue:

     "JOYEUX NOEL GOTHAM -- Only 16 Shopping Days Left Till

     Christmas."

     The streets are bustling with jolly shoppers.  At a souvenir

     store, we find an exasperated MOM squabbling with her seven-

     year old.  Like many other storefronts in Gotham, this one is

     overflowing with bootleg BATMAN MERCHANDISE: t-shirts, key

     chains, ceramic figurines.  The kid is already wearing a

     Batman baseball cap and a little black cape, but he obviously

     wants more.

     Mom drags him off past another store window, this one full of

     SCRAP METAL, with a sign reading "AUTHENTIC FRAGMENTS OF THE

     BATWING -- $19.95 and up."  A PANHANDLER is perched at the

     entrance.  Beneath his array jacket is a grubby sweatshirt

     with the familiar yellow-and-black logo.  In Gotham this

     winter, Batmania is everywhere...

EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - LATER THAT NIGHT

     Two hours later, the SNOWSTORM's grown into a full-fledged

     blizzard.  The drifts are two feet deep and the streets are

     all but empty of cars.  A massive SNOW PLOW the size of a

     Panzer tank rumbles past, FILLING THE FRAME...

     ...and revealing, as it passes, a group of CAROLERS, all

     bundled up in mufflers and parkas.  Unbothered by the weather,

     they walk the street singing, spreading cheer and goodwill to

     the few passersby.

     They've just gone into a lovely 

a capella

 rendition of "Silent

     Night" when an oversized DELIVERY TRUCK, outfitted with snow

     chains, clanks slowly past in the wake of the plow.  Its sides

     are decorated with cartoon igloos advertising a popular ice

     cream snack -- POLAR BARS -- oddly inappropriate for this time

     of year.

     A streetcorner SANTA, with bell and bucket, WAVES at the truck

     as it rounds a corner.  The CAROLERS carol.  Then --

     -- a VIOLENT EXPLOSION rocks the street -- followed by the

     sound of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE and a high, wailing SECURITY ALARM.

EXT. SCHRACH AND CO. - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     Around the corner there's CARNAGE on the streets.  The windows

     have blown out of Gotham's leading jewelry store.  Gut-shot

     SECURITY GUARDS stagger and go face down in the snow as

     ROBBERS, dressed in white camouflage gear, clamber out through

     the shattered glass with SACKFULS OF LOOT.

     CAROLERS spill around the corner to see what's going on, but a

     spray of GUNFIRE sends them scattering in panic.  The POLAR

     BAR truck pulls even with the jewelry store, and as it does...

     The REAR DOORS open.  A RAMP slides down from the back of the

     truck.  The ROBBERS scramble aboard, and mere seconds later

     SLIDE out AGAIN -- riding atop five SKIDOO SNOWMOBILES.

     SIRENS HOWL.  A POLICE CAR appears, taking the corner just a

     trifle too fast -- FISHTAILING on the icy street and plowing

     into a drift.

INT. SQUAD CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The COPS gun the engine, but their wheels are spinning in the

     snow -- no traction.  They're about to climb out and give

     chase on foot when, through the windshield, they see the

     Salvation Army SANTA...

     ...HOISTING AN AK-47 AND FIRING DIRECTLY AT THEM.  The

     windshield disintegrates and the COPS sink from view as SANTA

     races off to the last of the snowmobiles, which is already

     burdened with LOOT.

EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     MORE SQUAD CARS converge on the jewelry store -- but it's

     difficult to carry on a high-speed pursuit when the snow's a

     foot deep and the best you can do is 6 MPH.  The COP CARS skid

     to a halt, blocked by the rumbling SNOWPLOW.  By now, of

     course, the LOOTERS are gone -- scooting off on either side of

     the plow, sticking to the snowy sidewalks.

EXT. STREETS - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     SNOWMOBILES glide across the sidewalks, sending the few hardy

     souls who are out on the streets DIVING FOR COVER.  A couple

     of DERELICTS are cowering behind a fire hydrant, trying to

     avoid getting run over.  Every time they poke their heads out,

     another SKIDOO whizzes past, missing them by inches.

     The ROBBERS fan out in various directions.  These guys are

     obviously going to get away clean -- 

unless

...

     The DERELICT points up at the night sky, where a BEACON is

     blazing in the darkness -- THE BLACK SILHOUETTE OF A BAT...

INT. POLICE CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     MORE SIRENS.  A COP takes a radio call as he streaks down the

     long wide avenue which borders Gotham Park -- one of the few

     streets which is relatively clear.  The COP at the wheel goes

     wide-eyed and nudges his partner in disbelief.

     Before their eyes, FIVE SNOWMOBILES appear from the cross

     streets up ahead and CONVERGE at the entrance to Gotham Park.

     Bringing up the rear is SANTA CLAUS.

                               COP

               What the hell -- ?

EXT. ENTRANCE TO PARK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     BRAKES SQUEAL.  

Several

 squad cars are now massed at the

     entrance to the park -- but there's one problem.  The city's

     snow plows don't operate on the park roads -- and the entrance

     is blocked off with SAWHORSES reading "CLOSED TO TRAFFIC."  A

     huge steep drift prevents them from entering -- and so all

     they can do is stand by helplessly, WATCHING as the

     snowmobiles vanish into the trees.

     The COPS race about like headless chickens, trying to concoct

     a plan.  A couple of them are trying to scale the stone walls

     of the park.  Another is at his car, barking into a radio

     mike:

                               COP WITH MIKE

               Yeah, you heard me.  Snowmobiles!

(pause)

               So what do we do?  Chase 'em on foot??

     ALL EYES TURN at the blare of a horn.  The COPS peer down the

     long corridor of the cross street -- and see a STRANGE BLACK

     VEHICLE barreling toward them at 90 MPH, with no intention of

     stopping...

     THE BATMOBILE!!  COPS dive left and right.  A split-second

     later...

     ...a FORTY-FOOT JET of NOVA-INTENSITY FLAME erupts from the

     front of the jet-black supercar -- instantaneously DISSOLVING

     the drift that blocks the entrance to the park -- turning the

     ice and snow on the paths before it into water!

     The BATMOBILE screams past in the wink of an eye.  The COPS

     get to their feet; cold as it is, they're 

sweating

.  One of

     them mops his brow and announces, dumfounded:

                               COP I

               ...That was 

Batman

.

                               COP II

               NO SHIT!!

     COP II yanks COP I into the nearest squad car, and the others

     follow suit.  ENGINES REV.  As long as the BATMOBILE's cleared

     a path, they might as well join in the chase...

EXT. BRIDLE PATH - THAT MOMENT

     TWO BURLY TEENAGERS -- both dressed in RED BERETS and PARKAS

     with BLACK BATMAN SWEATSHIRTS visible underneath -- are

     trudging along the path when they're STARTLED by a pair of

     speeding SKIDOOS.  Moments later, they spot a RED GLOW on the

     horizon...

     ...and their JAWS DROP as the BATMOBILE roars into view,

     BURNING OFF THE SNOW IN ITS PATH.  Thrilled beyond words, they

     WHOOP WITH GLEE, slapping high-fives as the car streaks past.

INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT

     His face is weirdly illuminated by the flame still spitting

     from the front of the car.  Cool as ever -- approaching the

     chase as a simple problem in logic -- he checks a radar

     display on his dashboard and sees FIVE BLIPS.

EXT. PARK - ON SQUAD CARS - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The cops follow along in BATMAN's path.  The lead car LOSES

     CONTROL and plows headlong into a drift.  The DRIVER jams the

     pedal, but his rear wheels end up digging a deep rut in the

     ice.  He sits there cursing, pumping the accelerator as other

     COPS race past him on foot.

INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN

     The various ROBBERS have spread out, their vehicles BOUNDING

     over the hilly terrain of the park.  He spots two of them up

     ahead; as he draws closer, they PART WAYS, veering off to the

     left and right...

ANGLE ON BATMOBILE - MOVING

     PODS OPEN on the front fenders, and MISSILE LAUNCHERS rotate

     into place.  The Batmobile fires a pair of HEAT-SEEKING

     TORPEDOS, which BURROW into the snow on either side and

     disappear.

ANGLE ON LEFT SNOWMOBILE - MOVING

     The DRIVER looks back over his shoulder and sees what appears

     to be a BLACK SHARK FIN plowing through the snow behind him,

     GAINING FAST.  He takes evasive action, but the SHARK FIN

     always seems to follow.  Just as he approaches the crest of a

     hill...

     ...the TORPEDO slams into the rear of the SNOWMOBILE.  The

     force of impact knocks the ROBBER cleanly off.  His LOOT lands

     in the snow beside him, but the SNOWMOBILE keeps going --

     sailing over the crest of the hill and striking the rocks

     beyond with a deafening EXPLOSION.

ANGLE ON RIGHT SNOWMOBILE - MOVING

     This ROBBER's a little smarter than his buddy.  When he sees

     the shark fin on his tail, he noses his snowmobile off into a

     GROVE OF TREES.  The trees are too closely spaced for the

     torpedo to maneuver; it strikes the nearest tree trunk and

     explodes harmlessly.

     The ROBBER is feeling good about himself, because the

     Batmobile can't follow either.  But BATMAN has a Plan B.  As

     he drives alongside the grove, he HITS THE ACCELERATOR,

     passing the snowmobile on its left.  A STEEL SPIKE attached to

     a cable launches from the side of the Batmobile and WEDGES

     ITSELF into a distant TREE.

     The cable goes taut, and the tree TOPPLES -- directly into the

     path of the second SNOWMOBILE.  The vehicle crashes into the

     trunk, and the hapless ROBBER goes cartwheeling head-over-

     heels into a drift.

     In the distance, COPS appear -- racing to the scene on foot,

     ready for mop-up duty.  BATMAN kills the flamethrower, hits

     the brakes, and FISHTAILS, doing a quick 180 on the snow.

     He's just spotted fresh quarry: snowmobiles three and four,

     whizzing over a rolling white pasture in the distance.

EXT. PARK - THAT MOMENT

     We're at a makeshift CAMPSITE -- where a cluster of HOMELESS

     PEOPLE are burning refuse in a garbage can to keep warm.  They

     look on in puzzlement as the two SNOWMOBILES whiz past and

     disappear over a crest of a hill...

EXT. LAKEFRONT - ON SNOWMOBILES #3 AND #4

     They bounce down the hillside and SKID -- arriving at the edge

     of a frozen-over LAKE.  With the roar of the Batmobile behind

     them, the two DRIVERS get the same idea simultaneously.

     Smiling, they rev their engines and set out over the surface

     of the lake.

     Now the Batmobile crests the ridge.  The car's weight tips

     suddenly and it begins to skid down the hill toward the lake.

     BATMAN sees what's happening and kills the flamethrower just

     in time -- but he can't brake the car on the snowy slope.  The

     prow of the Batmobile slides out onto the edge of the lake --

     -- and under its weight, the ICE begins to crack.  The left

     front tire takes a sudden dip -- and worse yet, the car is

     sliding forward.

INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN

     He shifts frantically from drive to reverse, trying to rock

     the car out of its predicament, but his rear wheels find no

     purchase.  He can hear the ice cracking beneath him.

     Grimacing, he throws a switch on the dashboard --

EXT. LAKE - ON BATMOBILE

     -- and the trunk pops open.  An industrial-strength GRAPPLING

     HOOK shoots upward and digs in at a point beyond the crest of

     the hill; and a concealed WINCH ASSEMBLY begins to grind away,

     hauling the Batmobile uphill, out of danger.

INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN

     Suspended just above the icy lake, he sees the SNOWMOBILE

     vanishing into the distance.  He opens (yet another) panel on

     the dashboard...

EXT. LAKE - ON SNOWMOBILES #3 AND #4

     The ROBBERS give each other a big thumbs-up.  They're almost

     halfway across the lake now and the Batmobile is disabled.

     All at once they hear a strange WHISTLING overhead...

     Fireworks?  No, it's a THERMITE BOMB -- rocketing past them,

     hitting the ice some forty feet ahead and EXPLODING GAUDILY.

     JAGGED CHUNKS OF ICE break free and SHIFT in the frigid water

     -- and the ROBBERS are skidding into the drink before they

     know what's hit them.

ANGLE ON SNOWMOBILE #5 - MOVING

     The last of the robbers is SANTA CLAUS -- his big sack filled

     not with toys, but precious stones.  He approaches the edge of

     the park, negotiating his way through a maze of rocky

     outcroppings.  He squirts out from behind a boulder into a

     clearing...

     ...and GASPS in PANIC as a SEARING BURST OF FLAME erupts

     behind him.  The BATMOBILE speeds out from the other side of

     the boulder; SANTA twists his accelerator, desperately trying

     to build up speed.

     As it is, he's barely managing to stay ahead of the

     flamethrower.  But the jet of flame suddenly DIES; the HOOD of

     the Batmobile rises half a foot --

     -- and TWIN PROJECTILES launch into the air.  A heavy NET is

     strung between them -- and it lands SMACK ON TOP OF SANTA

     CLAUS, entangling the snowmobile and stopping him in his

     tracks.

     Immobilized, he watches through the net in horror as the

     Batmobile barrels down.  When the great black machine is

     almost atop him --

     -- it stops on a dime six inches from his heavily-padded

     frame.

EXT. ENTRANCE TO PARK - A MINUTE LATER - NIGHT

     The COPS are spread out near the entrance.  They've rounded up

     the other ROBBERS and returned most of the loot.  They hear a

     dull ROAR in the distance...

     ...and a few seconds later the BATMOBILE streaks into view,

     dragging the NET behind it -- SANTA, his loot, and his

     snowmobile, all tied up in one tidy parcel.

     At the entrance to the park, the NET detaches itself from the

     Batmobile, dumping SANTA into the hands of the waiting COPS.

     Without stopping, the BATMOBILE roars out of the park and

     vanishes whence it came.  A mildly-humiliated COP turns to his

     colleague and SHRUGS:

                               COP I

               ...Merry Christmas.

     The second COP points to SANTA, still struggling in the net.

                               COP II

               Gift-wrapped and everything.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. CITY HALL - DAY

     TV MINICAM CREWS are camped out on the steps of City Hall,

     with a sizable crowd watching from the street.  COMMISSIONER

     GORDON is reading from a prepared statement.

                               GORDON

               After a high-speed chase -- over $750,000

               in precious jewels were recovered intact

               by the police force -- working in concert

               with Batman.

     At the sound of Batman's name, a CHANTING goes up in the

     crowd:

                               VOICES IN CROWD

               TAKE BACK THE STREETS!  TAKE BACK THE

               STREETS!  TAKE BACK THE --

     GORDON winces and lets out a sigh.  The CHANTERS are a group

     of pugnacious, well-muscled KIDS, late teens and early

     twenties, all dressed in identical garb: black Batman

     SWEATSHIRTS and little red Guardian-angel BERETS.  They're

     obviously members of the same club -- just like the guys we

     saw in the park.

     GORDON waits for them to shut up, but they don't; so he grabs

     the mike and speaks slowly and distinctly, trying to be heard

     over the din.

                               GORDON

               I would like to stress -- that while this

               city enjoys a special relationship with

               Batman --

(louder)

               -- we do not condone 

vigilantism

 --

(practically screaming)

               -- IN ANY FORM.

     It's no use.  He's totally drowned out by the RED BERETS, who

     continue to shout and shake their fists.  Giving up, he

     returns the mike to a REPORTER and marches up the steps in a

     huff.  The RED BERETS CHEER.

CUT TO:

INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN

     The evening news: a live, on-the-spot interview from Gotham

     Square.  A superimposed GRAPHIC identifies a surly kid in a

     RED BERET as "MIKE SEKOWSKY -- SPOKESPERSON -- ORDER OF THE

     BAT."

                               SEKOWSKY

               And hey!  Where does this --

(BLEEP; expletive deleted)

               -- Gordon get off calling us 

?

               We're not breakin' any laws.  We're a

               group of concerned citizens, that's all --

just like Batman

.

                               WOMAN IN CROWD

               You people are nothing but hoodlums!

                               SEKOWSKY

               Hey, lady -- we're out here on patrol

               riskin' our necks to 

protect

 old biddies

               like you.

(into mike)

               If this lame-o Gordon could do his 

job

 --

     MORE CATCALLS from the crowd.  The picture jumps suddenly as a

     minicam is jostled; some sort of SCUFFLE appears to be

     breaking out.  Before it does, CAMERA PULLS BACK from the TV

     screen, placing us in:

INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - NIGHT

     where ALFRED THE BUTLER is watching the Sekowsky interview

     with extreme dismay.  As he trims the crusts from a pair of

     hearty watercress sandwiches, he SLICES HIS FINGER OPEN.

     ALFRED makes a pained face -- it's all Sekowsky's fault.

     Onscreen, the fracas continues; SEKOWSKY has recommandeered

     the mike...

                               SEKOWSKY (on TV)

               We're provin' that the spirit of Batman is

               alive in this city.  We're gonna 

take back

the streets

!

     SEKOWSKY raises a fist.  Behind him, his CRONIES begin to

     chant: "TAKE BACK THE STREETS!  TAKE BACK THE STREETS!"

     Incensed, sucking on his finger, ALFRED moves to the TV and

     flicks it off.

     He turns on the radio in search of something more soothing.

     "Good King Wenceslas" pipes through the manor; smiling, ALFRED

     sets the sandwich plate alongside a steaming kettle on a

     Sterling silver tea service.

INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The CAROL CONTINUES UNDERNEATH as ALFRED, white linen draped

     over one forearm, sets the tea tray down on his master's big

     mahogany desk.  He digs in his pocket for a key and unlocks a

     side drawer.

     The drawer contains a stack of yellowed, aging NEWPAPER

     CLIPPINGS -- among them one which reads "THOMAS WAYNE

     MURDERED: Prominent Doctor, Wife Slain in Robbery.

     Unidentified Gunman Leaves Child Unharmed."  ALFRED digs

     around beneath the clippings and finds a concealed SWITCH at

     the rear of the drawer.

     Gears grind, and a sectional bookcase detaches itself from the

     wall -- sliding out a couple of feet to reveal a STONE

     STAIRWAY which descends into darkness...

INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     Descending the stone stairs, ALFRED arrives in the Batcave.

     "Good King Wenceslas" is on the speakers down here as well.

     Across a catwalk the BATMOBILE rests on its little plateau,

     wrapped in a tarp.

     ALFRED clears some space on a lab table and sets the tea

     service down.  He glances up at the bank of video monitors and

     sees SEKOWSKY, still babbling, on several channels

     simultaneously.  He scans the cave, but there's no trace of

     BRUCE.

                               ALFRED

               Sir?  -- MASTER BRUCE??

     As if in response, BATS screech and flutter in the distant

     recesses of the cavern.  ALFRED turns suddenly and sees BRUCE

     behind him, suspended from a thin filament wire, RISING OUT OF

     A BOTTOMLESS ABYSS.

                               BRUCE

               I'm not deaf, Alfred.  I hear you.

     He's wearing his civvie -- tweed pants and cashmere sweater --

     but he's got the utility belt, with its spring-action reel,

     buckled about his waist.  Clutching a bundle, he hangs in

     midair for a moment, dangling over the void.  ALFRED slowly

     regains his composure:

                               ALFRED

               I took the liberty of preparing tea.

(indicating tbe monitors)

               I take it you've been watching the news?

     BRUCE, still dangling, glances up at the SEKOWSKY interview

     and nods.

                               BRUCE

               Yeah...lot of crazy people in this world.

     BRUCE rocks back and forth to build up momentum.  He kicks off

     on the nearest stone outcropping, lands gracefully on the

     Batcave floor, and unbuckles his belt.  Preoccupied, he drops

     his mysterious bundle on the lab table: a roll of black

     fabric, and a cluster of lightweight, hollow ALUMINUM RODS,

     connected by what appears to be SURGICAL TUBING.

                               ALFRED

               I should inform you...Christmas is

               approaching, and we've received our annual

               solicitation from the Fireman's Toy Fund.

(eyeing the equipment)

               If I may inquire...?

                               BRUCE

               Oh, yeah.  Watch this.

     BRUCE hits a trigger on a tiny gas canister attached to the

     tubing.  The tubing inflates and the rods spring erect --

     stiffening, wing-like, into something which looks remarkably

     like the skeleton of an umbrella.

                               ALFRED

               Most ingenious, sir.  What exactly 

 it?

                               BRUCE

               What does it look like?

                               ALFRED

               To the untrained eye, sir, it looks

               remarkably like...the skeleton of an

               umbrella.

     Sounds good.  BRUCE eyes his new invention, thinks it over,

     smiles slyly.

                               BRUCE

               Good guess, Alfred.  That's exactly right.

     BRUCE hits the trigger, and the rods WILT with a hiss.  He

     sits at his lab table; ALFRED unfolds a napkin on his lap,

     pours a cup of tea.

                               ALFRED

               Splendid, sir, and if I may say, I'm glad

               you're putting your time to such

               productive use.

(beat)

               Now -- the Toy Fund.  Our contribution

               last year was a half-million dollars...

                               BRUCE

               We can do better than that.

                               ALFRED

               Then there's the foster-parents program...

               the Gotham homeless crusade...

     BRUCE nods abstractedly and tucks into his sandwich.  He seems

     oddly preoccupied -- not exactly melancholy, but his thoughts

     are obviously a million miles away.  ALFRED looks on,

     concerned:

                               ALFRED (cont.)

               Is something troubling you, sir?

                               BRUCE

               Yeah...the holidays, I guess.  Always gets

               me thinking about...

(he changes the subject)

               And to tell you the truth, I'm a little --

               concerned about Vicki.

                               ALFRED

(anxiously)

               Miss Vale, sir...?

                               BRUCE

               Yeah.  I've been thinking about it lately.

               Thinking about it a lot...

(gravely; shaking his head)

               ...and I still can't figure out what to

               get her for Christmas.

     BRUCE shoots ALFRED a solemn, perplexed look -- and ALFRED

     heaves an audible sigh of relief as we

CUT TO:

INT. PRISON CELL - DAY

     TIGHT ON a stack of COOPS and CAGES, piled high against a bare

     concrete wall.  Each cage -- and there are at least two dozen

     of them -- contains a twittering BIRD: starlings, pigeons,

     cardinals, titwillows...

     CAMERA PULLS BACK from the bars of the cages to reveal a VERY

     ODD FIGURE in prison greys.  A CANARY, perched on his

     shoulder, SINGS HAPPILY as he stands in front of a grimy,

     cracked mirror, plastering back his hair, BUFFING HIS NAILS

     with quick, birdlike strokes.

     MR. BONIFACE is beak-nosed, epicene, and so fat that it seems

     his skin should burst; the adjective that comes to mind is

     "obscene."  Despite his eccentric appearance, he comports

     himself with overblown, theatrical dignity.  Fastidious and

     preening, he does not suffer insults lightly.

     CAMERA PULLS BACK FURTHER -- through another set of bars --

     and we realize that MR. BONIFACE is himself caged.  A PRISON

     GUARD arrives to slide back his cell door...

                               GUARD

               Up and at 'em, Pengy.  -- Pengy?

     MR. BONIFACE pointedly ignores the GUARD, refusing to

     acknowledge the odious (if wholly appropriate) nickname.

                               GUARD (cont.)

Boniface

...

     MR. BONIFACE finally turns.  With an expression of extreme

     distaste, he affixes a MONOCLE over one eye, returns the

     canary to its cage and allows himself to be ushered out.

INT. WARDEN'S OFFICE - DAY

     MR. BONIFACE and his ATTORNEY sit at a long table across from

     the WARDEN and the members of the PAROLE BOARD.

                               PAROLE OFFICER

               You want to return the money you stole.

                               BONIFACE

               Intact.  The map will show you where it's

               buried.

     The PAROLE OFFICER stares skeptically at a hand-scrawled MAP.

                               PAROLE OFFICER

All

 of it.  Forty-two million dollars.

     MR. BONIFACE stares down humbly at the table -- as if he finds

     the mere mention of his transgression too embarrassing to

     bear.

                               PAROLE OFFICER II

               Why this sudden change of heart?

                               MR. BONIFACE

               Gentlemen, I want my debt to be repaid in

               full.  I want to be a part of civilized

               society!

(oozing sincerity)

               Prison life is not for me.  The guilt, the

               fear, the constant shame...one meets a

               disturbingly low class of people.

                               PAROLE OFFICER II

               Sure, but -- forty-two million dollars??

     MR. BONIFACE nods plaintively.  It's quite a perfomlance.  He

     dabs at his face with a handkerchief; it's hot in here, and

     he's the delicate type...

                               WARDEN

               His record's clean.  Thirteen years

               without an incident.

                               ATTORNEY

               I'd like to point out, my client's put his

               time to good use.  A student of

               ornithology...articles published in

               several respected journals...

     The PAROLE OFFICER thumbs through a stack of magazines: 

Bird

World

, 

Ornithological Review

, 

Beaks And Feathers

, 

Nest Egg

.

                               MR. BONIFACE

               Birds, yes.  My only source of solace.

                               PAROLE OFFICER

               In light of this rather extraordinary

               gesture, I see no reason not to endorse

               your application for parole.

                               BONIFACE

               Thank you, sir.  You won't regret it.

     MR. BONIFACE shakes hands with the members of the PAROLE

     BOARD.  As the GUARDS escort him out, a BLACK MYNAH BIRD

     SQUAWKS LOUDLY from its cage in the corner of the office:

                               MYNAH

               CRIME DOES NOT PAY.  AAWWK!!  CRIME DOES

               NOT PAY.

     CHUCKLES all around.  On his way out the ATTORNEY gestures

     toward the mynah -- and BEAMS at the parole board:

                               ATTORNEY

Personally

 trained by my client.

INT. PRISON CELL - DAY

     Free time -- the cell doors are open and the convicts are

     milling around in the common area.  T-BONE, 220 lbs. of dumb,

     hulking beef, saunters up to his cell and finds his bunkmate,

     MR. BONIFACE, staring at a stack of EMPTY CAGES.  BONIFACE

     whirls on him suddenly, his face beet-red, APOPLECTIC WITH

     RAGE:

                               MR. BONIFACE

               -- 

Where are my birds

?!?

                               T-BONE

               Shit, Pengy.  I let 'em 

go

.

                               MR. BONIFACE

               Hermione.  My canary.  It's the dead of

               winter!

     T-BONE flops casually on his bunk, obviously enjoying MR.

     BONIFACE's profound distress.

                               T-BONE

               They were all cooped up.  With you leaving

               and all -- seemed like the humane thing to

               do.

     BONIFACE'S GAZE FALLS on a corner of the cell.  He spots a

     scattering of YELLOW FEATHERS -- a patch of FRESH BLOOD.  With

     a supreme effort of restraint, he turns and forces a smile...

                               MR. BONIFACE

               I see.  -- You might as well have this.  I

               won't be needing it...

     He tosses a SONY WALKMAN to T-BONE, who flicks it on.  The dim

     strains of CLASSICAL MUSIC are audible through the

     earphones...

                               T-BONE

               Well, thanks, Pengy.  No hard feelings.

(chuckling to himself)

               Y'know, I'm gonna miss that pudgy little

               ass of yours.

     T-BONE tunes the Walkman to a rock station, slips the headset

     on, grins from his bunk.  TWO GUARDS arrive.  As they escort

     him out, MR. BONIFACE mutters:

                               MR. BONIFACE

               You won't miss it long.

EXT. PRISON - MAIN ENTRANCE - DAY

     It's fifteen degrees outside as MR. BONIFACE -- aka THE

     PENGUIN -- waddles forth from the prison gates, regally

     attired in cutaway and pin-stripes.  He pauses to inhale a

     deep lungful of the icy air; then, with a smile of

     exhilaration, he removes his coat and STRETCHES -- spreading

     his wings, REVELING in the cold.

     A STRETCH LIMO pulls up.  Two identically gaunt and vulture-

     like DANDIES, formally dressed, with bowler hats and

     umbrellas, step out to meet him.  These two gentlemen -- FRICK

     and FRACK -- serve as the Penguin's general factoti and

     "business managers."

                               FRICK

               Welcome back, Mr. Boniface.

                               PENGUIN

               Mr. Frick.  Mr. Frack.  Our years of

               planning are about to pay off.

INT. LIMO - MOVING - DAY

     Now that he's loose, the PENGUIN's rapacious side is beginning

     to show.  His eyes twinkle with greed as he contemplates his

     own ingenuity.

                               PENGUIN

               I take it they found the money all right?

                               FRACK

               We buried it exactly as you specified.

               $42,271,009...

                               PENGUIN

               How much have we got left?

     FRICK reaches into his coat for a BALANCE SHEET.

                               FRICK

               Let's see -- an initial capitalization of

               42 million and change, compounded over

               thirteen years, at an annual return of

               just under sixteen percent --

                               PENGUIN

               Fine, fine.  How 

much

?

                               FRICK

               Seventy-nine million.  -- Excluding the

               sum we buried.

     THE PENGUIN lets out a dry, heaving CHORTLE, midway between a

     normal laugh and a DUCK'S QUACK.  He checks his watch and

     reaches into his pocket for a small ELECTRONIC DEVICE.

                               PENGUIN

               Speaking of burials...

EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY

     T-BONE on work detail.  He's got the Walkman on and he's

     shoveling snow to the beat.  He winces, and removes the

     headphones...

     The MUSIC he was listening to has been replaced by an eerie,

     high-pitched WHINE.  He's twisting the knob, trying to find

     the station he was tuned to, when a PIGEON dives down STRAIGHT

     AT HIS HEAD.

                               T-BONE

               HEY -- !

     He drops the shovel as the bird STRIKES, glancing off his

     head.  Before he can react, THREE MORE PIGEONS have swooped

     down at him, PECKING at his head and shoulders in a frenzy.

     He lets out a HOWL and staggers through the prison yard in a

     frenzy.  DOZENS of PIGEONS are pouring over the prison walls,

     SHRIEKING HIDEOUSLY, descending on him.  He falls to the

     ground screaming for help, but the other prisoners run like

     rabbits, terrified...

     By the time the GUARDS come racing across the courtyard,

     T-BONE's no longer even visible.  There's just a swarming,

     man-shaped mass of PIGEONS, pecking away, flapping their wings

     insanely.  Covering their faces as they move in, the GUARDS

     blow their whistles -- BEAT AT the pigeons with billy clubs.

     All at once, the PIGEONS take off 

en masse

 -- leaving T-BONE's

     mutilated corpse sprawled in the yard.  A GUARD notices the

     Walkman, picks up the earphones to listen, and hears nothing

     but ROCK MUSIC -- "Surfin' Bird" by the Trashmen.  Bird bird

     bird, bird is the word...

EXT. ROAD - ON PENGUIN'S LIMO - MOVING

     An AERIAL VIEW of the LIMO as it cruises down the deserted

     road leading away from the prison.  It disappears from view --

     and all at once the frame is filled with PIGEONS, great

     squalling FLOCKS of them, dutifully following their master as

     he makes his way back to Gotham City.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT

     ALFRED opens the front door and finds a bundled-up VICKI out

     on the portico, red-cheeked, flushed, and happy.  She pulls

     him forward, gives him a quick peck on the cheek.

                               VICKI

               Guess what, Alfred.  I think I found a

               present for Bruce.

     She's got a long, skinny GIFT BOX propped up against the

     exterior wall.  At first it doesn't want to fit through the

     door -- it must be eight feet long -- but with ALFRED's help

     she gets it inside.  The faithful butler stares curiously at

     this odd-shaped gift...

                               VICKI (cont.)

               Skis.  -- Don't let on, okay?

                               ALFRED

               He won't hear a word of it from me.

                               VICKI

               He's such a nightmare to shop for.  --

               What do you 

get

 him year after year,

               Alfred?

                               ALFRED

(conspiratorially)

               I find you can't go wrong with

               surveillance equipment.  Let me put this

               under the tree...

                               VICKI

               Not so fast.

     She reaches into the pocket of her coat and pulls out another

     small gift.  ALFRED stares at the tag -- "TO ALFRED, LOVE

     VICKI" -- and tries to suppress a HUGE GRIN.

                               ALFRED

               Why, Miss Vale -- !

                               VOICE FROM BEHIND

               What's all this?

     ALFRED and VICKI turn.  It's BRUCE, dressed for dinner,

     marching down the long stairway in the entry hall.  VICKI

     waves frantically.

                               VICKI

               Don't look.  It's your present.

     VICKI rushes over to embrace him.  He gapes at the long skinny

     box --

                               BRUCE

               What'd you get me?  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?

     VICKI frowns and gives him a kiss.  She nestles up against

     him.  WHISPERS in his ear:

                               VICKI

               I'm going to give you the happiest

               Christmas you've ever had.

     Still in the clinch, BRUCE shoots a look at ALFRED.  Taking

     the hint, ALFRED clears his throat and bends to pick up one

     end of the ski box.  He backs out of the entry hall, dragging

     the box before him...

CUT TO:

EXT. GOTHAM PARK - NIGHT

     FIRES burn in garbage cans.  TENTS and LEAN-TOS dot the snowy

     landscape.  Men, women, and children wander aimlessly,

     huddling against the cold.

     An army of the HOMELESS has set up camp in Gotham Park.  On

     the nearby periphery, PICKETERS -- half concerned citizens,

     half down-and-outers -- are marching the sidewalks, keeping a

     candlelight VIGIL.  Hand-lettered placards read: "SAVE THE

     PARK."  "PARKS ARE FOR PEOPLE."  "THIS PARK IS OUR HOME."

     The source of the protest?  A towering SIGN posted in a corner

     of the park, announcing the imminent consuuction of a new

     luxury highrise -- the GOTHAM PARK TOWERS -- a project of Shaw

     Construction, Inc.

     A LAMBORGHINI sits at a traffic light nearby...

INT. LAMBORGHINI - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     BRUCE and VICKI, dressed for dinner, stare out at the

     demonstration.

                               VICKI

               Homeless.

(beat)

               I was just down here Tuesday.  Seems like

               there's more every day.

     BRUCE starts to say something, but can't think of anything to

     say.

                               VICKI (cont.)

               Christmas time.  And they say there's over

               a thousand people living in the park

               already.

                               BRUCE

               -- Yeah.

     The light changes.  BRUCE throws the car into gear and -- at

     the next intersection -- turns the car right, into the park.

EXT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT

     Despite the name, it's a tony little bistro catering to

     Gotham's elite.  A PANHANDLER, underdressed for the cold, has

     been hustling the customers as they come out; a couple of

     PARKING ATTENDANTS are trying to drag him discreetly away as

     BRUCE'S CAR pulls up.

     A VALET opens the car for BRUCE and VICKI, who look on in

     concern as the PANHANDLER gets the bum's rush.  The liveried

     DOORMAN shrugs apolagetically -- sorry for the inconvenience

     -- as they enter.

INT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT

     Post-dinner.  VICKI's got a sheaf of PHOTOS spread out on the

     table in front of BRUCE -- shots of Gotham's HOMELESS, being

     forcibly evicted from slum dwellings, erecting their

     SHANTYTOWNS in Gotham Park.

                               VICKI

               They're already razing the tenements and

               SRO's downtown.  These people don't have

               anyplace else to go.

(beat)

               If the city starts selling off the park...

     BRUCE takes a good long look at his opulent surroundings.

     HUGE WINDOWS open on a serene and picturesque view of the

     park; CAMPFIRES flicker in the distance...

                               BRUCE

               -- Yeah.  I guess I'll pass on dessert.

                               VICKI

(taking his hand)

               Bruce, you do a lot more than most people

               even dream of.

                               BRUCE

               Sure.  Comes off the top of my taxes --

                               VICKI

               That's not what I meant.

     They exchange a long silent look.  Of course she's referring

     to Batman.  Still, the argument doesn't hold much water with

     BRUCE.

                               BRUCE

               -- What I "do" doesn't come close to the

               root of the problem, Vicki.

(long pause)

               I'm just a Band-Aid.

                               VOICE FROM BEHIND

               Bruce!  It's been ages!

     VICKI turns -- and rapidly closes her photo folder.

     Millionaire construction magnate RANDALL SHAW is in the

     restaurant table-hopping, and he's just glommed onto BRUCE.

                               BRUCE

               Randall.  You remember Vicki.  -- How's

               the construction business?

                               SHAW

               The park tower?  All systems go.  

If

 we

               can get the junkies and winos cleared

               out...

(a big grin)

               Not too late to get in on the deal.

                               BRUCE

               I'll think about it.

                               SHAW

               Say, Walter Barrett's due back from

               Europe.  We should all get together at the

               club.

(clapping him on the shoulder)

               Nice to see you again,  Miss Veal.

     "Miss Veal" maintains a big phony smile as SHAW moves off to

     the next table.  She murmurs to BRUCE through clenched teeth:

                               VICKI

               What a pig.

                               BRUCE

               I've known him since he was seven years

               old.  He was a pig then too.

                               VICKI

               Now he wants to gobble up the 

park

...

(shivering)

               Bruce -- isn't there something you can 

do

               about people like that?

                               BRUCE

               What, tie him up with a bat-rope?

                               VICKI

               No, you idiot.  I meant 

you

.  

Bruce

.

     BRUCE nods -- oh, yeah.  Subtle distinction.

INT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT

     BRUCE and VICKI emerge from the restaurant.  He hands his

     parking stub to a VALET.  A crowd's beginning to form in the

     lot outside...

     The red-and-blue bubble of a POLICE CAR is flashing a short

     distance off, near the entrance to the park.  TWO RED BERETS,

     in full Order-of-the-Bat regalia, look on as a recently-mugged

     WOMAN JOGGER gives her statement to the investigating COPS.

     BRUCE and VICKI, intrigued by the Batman-wannabes, move a

     little closer -- within eavesdropping range:

                               RED BERET I

               We were on patrol.  Saw the whole thing.

                               JOGGER

               I was attacked.  Three men in ski masks --

                               COP I

(indicating the RED BERETS)

               And these two broke it up?

                               JOGGER

               These two??  They ran like rabbits.  I

               never 

saw

 anybody take off so --

                               RED BERET II

               Hey!  Somebody had to go for the cops.

                               COP II

               You.  SHUT UP, all right??

(to the JOGGER)

               Lady, who was it that bailed you out??

                               JOGGER

               A 

kid

.  Thirteen or fourteen tops.  He

               just came out of nowhere and -- tore into

               'em.

(shaking her head)

               It was so quick I didn't even see his

               face.

     Nearby, VICKI shoots a highly quizzical look at BRUCE, who

     responds with a mystified shrug.  Her professional curiosity

     piqued, she wanders over to introduce herself to the JOGGER.

     An exasperated COP leads the RED BERETS away from the crime

     site:

                               RED BERET I

               Dumb shit.  Shouldn'ta been jogging in the

               park at night anyway.

(sullenly)

               Look around you.  It's fulla 

bums

.

     BRUCE gestures at the RED BERET's Batman sweatshirt as he

     passes.

                               BRUCE

               Nice outfit.

                               RED BERET I

               Piss off, geek.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. WATERFRONT DISTRICT - NIGHT

     Snow blankets the abandoned warehouses rimming Gotham Harbor.

     FOGHORNS blare in the distance as a pair of STILETTO HEELS --

     totally inappropriate for the weather -- click across the

     sidewalk and pause at mid-block, where a wide wooden plank

     leads down from street level to a seedy hole-in-the-wall bar:

     the WHARF RAT.

INT. WHARF RAT - NIGHT

     A roughneck joint, about as trendy as the average bait shack.

     The clientele consists primarily of surly types who are saving

     up for their next tattoo.  A TV over the bar is tuned to the

     late news:

                               ANCHORWOMAN

               ...and tomorrow, the city's power elite

               will be turning out in force to greet

               millionaire industrialist Walter Barrett,

               who returns to Gotham after a five-year

               stay in Europe...

     The BARTENDER switches to a hockey game, because none of the

     rowdies at the bar give a shit about Walter Barrett.  None,

     that is, except for a strapping young bruiser named RICKY, who

     gets up and makes his way to a pay phone in the corner.

     Moments later, the owner of the high heels enters; she opens

     her black fur coat and unwraps her muffler, revealing exotic,

     vaguely Eurasian features.  She's dark and elegant, fine-

     boned, regal of bearing -- and her name, though we don't know

     it yet, is SELINA KYLE.

     She's not the kind of girl who typically frequents the Wharf

     Rat, and so her entrance creates quite a stir.  A LONGSHOREMAN

     at the nearby pool table misses his shot and digs a rut in the

     felt.  Two blowsy WHORES size her up territorially as she

     finds an open stool at the bar and settles in with serene

     indifference.

     The regulars, of course, are all but licking their chops.  The

     only guy in the joint who hasn't noticed her yet is RICKY,

     who's still on the phone:

                               RICKY

               Yo.  Ricky here.  What's the haps?

     In mid-conversation he notices SELINA.  She smiles invitingly

     -- right at him.  Mildly startled, he smiles back.

                               RICKY (cont.)

               Midnight.  No sweat.  See you then.

     He hangs up eagerly.  Then, with a deep breath, he hitches up

     his pants and swaggers over to SELINA's end of the bar.

                               SELINA

               Well.  "Ricky," is it?

                               RICKY

               How'd you know that?

                               SELINA

               I heard you on the phone.  Talking to your

               girlfriend.

                               RICKY

               Girlfriend?  No, no.  That was 

business

.

     SELINA makes a big show of peeling off her gloves.

                               SELINA

               If you've got time for a little pleasure

               ...maybe you'd like to buy me a drink.

     She clasps his hand.  His EYES BUG OUT.  Three enormous rings,

     a diamond bracelet -- there must be several thousand in rocks

     on her left hand alone.  RICKY gapes at the sparklers,

     bedazzled.

                               RICKY

               Jeez -- they look almost real.

                               SELINA

               Why wouldn't they be?

     RICKY is not the smoothest guy around, and his line of thought

     is all too evident.  He swallows hard and tries not to stare.

                               RICKY

               You'd have to be crazy.  Nobody'd wear the

               real thing to a dive like this.

                               SELINA

               Oh, they're real, all right.  So are

               these.

     She waves her FINGERNAILS -- long, polished, and talon-sharp

     -- in front of his eyes.  With lightning speed, before he can

     react, she pins his wrist to the bar -- and with one quick

     stroke carves a THIN BLOODY STRIPE in the back of his hand.

     SELINA's eyes flash as he gasps in shock.  He tries to jerk

     his hand away, but he can't break her grip.  Then -- her

     dominance firmly established -- she releases his hand with a

     coy, Cheshire-cat smile.

                               SELINA (cont.)

               Weren't we going to have a drink?

     He blinks, forces a chuckle, smiles unsteadily.  She takes his

     wounded hand, lifts it slowly to her mouth, and LAPS GENTLY at

     the blood.  RICKY is hypnotized.

     She's got an odd way of flirting, but RICKY finds it somehow

     -- intriguing.  He dabs at his hand with a napkin and signals

     to the BARTENDER.

CUT TO:

EXT. WATERFRONT - PIER 31 - NIGHT

     Just after midnight; the snow's still failing, the waters are

     icy, and the wharfs are deserted -- almost.  A small STEAMBOAT

     is docked at Pier 31, and the deck is lined with THUGS --

     mean, ugly, and heavily armed.

     A similar contingent of gun-toting GOONS is waiting to greet

     them on the dock below.  The boys on the dock hoist ASSAULT

     RIFLES as the BOAT THUGS extend a gangplank.  Something major

     is about to happen...

     The CHIEF DOCK GOON gestures to his LIEUTENANT, who grabs a

     black MEDICAL BAG.  Hands raised, the two of them start up the

     gangplank.

     Throughout all this, the DOCK GOONS keep their guns trained on

     the BOAT THUGS, covering their buddies.  One of them turns to

     a colleague:

                               DOCK GOON I

               Where's that goddam Ricky?

                               DOCK GOON II

               Probably out gettin' laid.  And here we

               are freezin' our balls off...

EXT. STEAMBOAT - ON DECK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The LIEUTENANT unloads chemical testing gear from his doctor's

     bag.  The lead BOAT THUG gestures to a stack of SHIPPING

     CRATES which rest atop a large NET spread out across the deck.

                               BOAT THUG I

               You pick.

     The CHIEF GOON selects a crate at random.  Two BOAT THUGS tip

     it on its side and, using a crowbar, pry off a FALSE BOTTOM --

     revealing a dozen packets of WHITE POWDER.

POV SHOT - HIGH ANGLE - THAT MOMENT

     We're now watching the scene from a vantage point atop a

     ramshackle boathouse at water's edge.  Down on the deck of the

     steamboat, the LIEUTENANT goes to work testing the

     merchandise.

                               LIEUTENANT

               It's pure.

REVERSE ANGLE - THAT MOMENT

     A BLACK SILHOUETTE is peering down from the boathouse roof.

     The mysterious watcher ducks quickly out of sight; the only

     details that register are a pair of ominously familiar POINTY

     EARS...

                               CHIEF GOON (O.S.)

               Let's do it.

     He gestures to his boys on the dock. A CRANE-AND-WINCH

     assembly rotates into place over the deck -- and the BOAT

     THUGS gather up the corners of the netting and attach them to

     the big hook.

                               BOAT THUG I

               Hold it.  Let's see the money.

     Down on the wharf, a DOCK GOON kneels beside a metal suitcase

     and opens it.  Lots of long green inside.  The BOAT THUG

     signals thumbs up, and the CRATES rise into the air as the

     goon with the suitcase starts up the gangplank.

LOW ANGLE - ON GANGPLANK - THAT MOMENT

     The goon with the suitcase marches up.  Beyond him, in the

     distance, a LITHE BLACK SHADOW vaults off the boathouse roof

     and makes a silent, graceful landing on the long shaft of the

     CRANE.

ANOTHER ANGLE - THAT MOMENT

     The moment of maximum tension: grim faces all around, everyone

     holding a gun on someone else as the suitcase arrives on deck

     and crane swings over the pier.

ANGLE ON CRANE - THAT MOMENT

     Razor-sharp, CHROME-STEEL TALONS slash suddenly through the

     air.

ON DOCK - LOW ANGLE - THAT MOMENT

     The netting GIVES WAY, and TWO DOZEN SHIPPING CRATES rain down

     onto the pier, CRUSHING two DOCK GOONS underneath.  The crates

     explode into splinters, littering the dock with drugs and

     random ART OBJECTS as the other DOCK GOONS scatter in panic.

ON STEAMBOAT - THAT MOMENT

     Nobody knows quite what's going on.  Panicking, the GOON with

     the suitcase full of money turns tail and dives for the

     gangplank.  BOAT THUG I sees him and squeezes off a quick

     shot.  Winged, the GOON topples off the gangplank and hits the

     drink, suitcase and all.

     Pandemonium.  All at once, everyone's OPENING FIRE.  Thinking

     he's been double-crossed, BOAT THUG I turns on the CHIEF GOON

     and SHOOTS HIM TWICE at point-blank range.

                               BOAT THUG I

               YOU SON OF A BITCH!

(to another BOAT THUG)

               Go after it.  Get the money.  GO!!

     He raises his gun, and the second BOAT THUG dutifully obeys --

     diving off the deck into a hail of gunfire.  Everyone's

     ducking for cover.  BOAT THUG I barks orders at the

     pilothouse:

                               BOAT THUG I

               Soltar las amarras!  -- CAST OFF!!

                               ANOTHER BOAT THUG

               LOOK!

     BOAT THUG I whirls, just in time to see a SHADOWY FIGURE

     landing cat-like on the deck mere yards away.  Clad in inky

     black leather from head to toe, the intruder's face is

     concealed by what appears to be a BONDAGE MASK.  Studded, with

     openings for the eyes and mouth, it spans one incongruous

     touch: a pair of POINTED CAT EARS.

     She bares her teeth and HISSES.

     It's a woman.

     BOAT THUG I is momentarily mesmerized.  In the time it takes

     him to lift his gun, she's produced a CAT-O'-NINE-TAILS.  She

     SNAPS it at him: REELS HIM IN; and with one lethal stroke,

     RAKES her steel talons across his face and throat.  He slumps

     to the deck, lifeless.

     The other BOAT THUG rushes her; she catches him under the jaw

     with a sudden upthrust, LIFTS HIM INTO THE AIR, and sends him

     toppling into the water.

     The gangplank falls aside as the steamboat pulls away from the

     pier.  She hoists an abandoned ASSAULT RIFLE, SCATTERS the

     DOCK GOONS with a round of automatic fire, and VAULTS off the

     boat -- landing in a graceful crouch on the edge of the pier.

     Most of the DOCK GOONS have taken flight, but a few unlucky

     specimens remain behind.  She somersaults forward; takes one

     goon off his feet with a crack of the whip; knocks another off

     the dock with a twirling high-kick to the jaw; sends two more

     reeling with swift talon-slashes.  The whole frenzied mop-up

     action takes just under ten seconds.  Alone at last, she

     stands back to survey the scene.

     Counting the stiff's on the boat -- which is now receding in

     the harbor -- there must be well over a dozen dead.  The snow

     is speckled with red.  A half-dozen bodies lie sprawled in

     their own blood; one of them, the lone survivor, is face-down

     and softly MOANING.

     Retracting her steel claws, the MASKED WOMAN crouches amid the

     wreckage of the smashed shipping crates.  BINDLES OF WHITE

     POWDER -- millions of dollars' worth -- are scattered all

     about the pier, but she couldn't seem less interested.

     Instead, she's checking the MANIFEST NUMBERS stamped on the

     sides of the crates.

     She finds crate #18396-BB and rummages among its contents

     until she comes up with a carefully-wrapped parcel.  She opens

     it carefully and holds it up for inspection.  The statuette of

     a RAVEN -- carved from solid onyx -- glistens in the

     moonlight.

     The WOMAN pauses long enough to slip a small CARD in the

     MOANING PUNK's back pocket.  Then, cradling the raven under

     one arm, she dashes off on silent cat feet.

     A LANTERN approaches.  It's an OLD SALT -- some kind of

     hapless night watchman -- and his face goes bone-white at the

     sight of the carnage on the docks.  He kneels beside the

     moaning punk, turns the body over, and GASPS -- because the

     PUNK'S FACE has been CLAWED TO SHREDS.

                               PUNK

               Murcielago.  MURCIELAGO!!

CUT TO:

INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - NIGHT

     The unique chamber in which we find ourselves is alive with

     the flutter and song of COLD-WEATHER BIRDS -- dozens of them,

     all chirping, flitting about in the rafters, alighting on

     special perches mounted in the walls.

     At the center of this penthouse room is a vast sunken POOL.

     ARCTIC TERNS loll on the surrounding rocks as a LACKEY with a

     wheelbarrow empties cracked ice into the already-frigid water.

     Carefully landscaped, it looks like the penguin exhibit at the

     Gotham Zoological Gardens.

     A MASSIVE, INDISTINCT SHAPE glides beneath the surface.  It's

     not a whale; it's too pink.  It is, instead, the PENGUIN --

     and as he breaks the surface, sputtering, he sees FRICK

     standing in the open doorway.

                               FRICK

               Mr. Boniface?  Your...visitor has arrived.

                               PENGUIN

               Thank you, Mr. Frick.  Show her in.

     The PENGUIN moves to the edge of the sunken pool.  Two of his

     LACKEYS swivel a CROSSBAR, which hangs from the ceiling by a

     long chain, into place over his head.  He grasps it with both

     hands -- and the crossbar RISES, hoisting his formidable bulk

     out of the water.

INT. HIGH-RISE - CORRIDOR - THAT MOMENT

     FRICK leads the VISITOR down a long corridor lined on either

     side with BIRD CAGES -- exotic songbirds with brilliantly-hued

     plumage.  CAMERA TRACKS ALONG behind her, and although we

     can't see her face, there must be something distinctively

feline

 about her -- because the BIRDS are shrieking and

     fluttering in their cages, RECOILING INSTINCTIVELY as she

     strolls past.

     FRICK opens a door and ushers her into...

INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     Our visitor -- SELINA KYLE -- enters the penguin-pool room.

     Her teeth begin to chatter.  The big bay windows have been

     thrown open, and SNOW is blowing in from outside. It's

freezing

 in here.

     She sees the PENGUIN -- wearing a thin dressing gown and an

     APRON outfitted with SEED POUCHES -- scattering birdseed on

     the window ledge for the pigeons, totally oblivious to the

     cold.  He turns, throws his arms wide in greeting, kisses the

     back of SELINA's hand.

                               PENGUIN

               Ah, Miss Kyle!  At last we meet.

                               SELINA

               At last we meet.  -- Pigeons?

                               PENGUIN

               Yes, they're common birds -- dirty,

               stupid, unattractive -- but they're very

               obedient, and they 

do

 crap on people's

               heads.  May I?

     She extends a SHOPPING BAG.  The PENGUIN removes a parcel and

     unwraps it, revealing the RAVEN STATUETTE.  He sets it on a

     nearby desk, fondles it reverently...and BEAMS at SELINA.

                               PENGUIN (cont.)

               I see your reputation was not exaggerated.

                               SELINA

               I've located the others.  All but one.

(shivering)

               I'm surprised you don't catch

               pneumonia -- !

     With an apologetic smile, the PENGUIN pulls the windows shut.

                               PENGUIN

               My normal body temperature is ninety-two

               degrees.  Germs find me inhospitable.

                               SELINA

               I see why they call you the Penguin.

                               PENGUIN

               They may call me that...but rarely more

               than once.  Champagne?

     She nods.  He pours two glasses, hands one to SELINA, raises a

     toast.

                               PENGUIN (cont.)

               My dear.  Here's to the 

second

 biggest

               crime in the history of Gotham City.

CUT TO:

INT. POLICE OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

     COMMISSIONER GORDON and another cop, LT. EDDIE BULLOCK, are in

     darkened antechamber adjacent to an interrogation room.

                               BULLOCK

               It wasn't about the drugs.  Whoever it was

               left thirty kilos sitting on the docks.

     They're watching, through a two-way glass panel, as a

     terrified man with a heavily-bandaged face tells his story.

     It's the lone survivor of the dock massacre, JULIO, and his

     voice is audible over a concealed intercom:

                               JULIO (filter)

               Un silueta negra -- con colmillos, y

               garras -- el demonio.  El murcielago.

               MURCIELAGO!

                               GORDON

               What's that he keeps saying?

                               BULLOCK

               "Murcielago."  -- Bat.

                               GORDON

               Nonsense.  That dock looked like a

               slaughter-house.  Batman's never committed

               murder.

                               BULLOCK

               We did find this in his back pocket.

     BULLOCK hands GORDON a CARD.  It reads: "THOSE WHO FEED ON THE

     SOUL OF GOTHAM WILL SUFFER MY WRATH" -- and in lieu of a

     signature, there's a little black BAT-EMBLEM in the bottom

     corner.

     While GORDON's staring at it, a POLICEMAN pokes his head in:

                               POLICEMAN

               Commissioner?  We've got Barrett.

INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT

     A cubicle down the hall.  The splenetic WALTER BARRETT,

     millionaire industrialist, is fidgeting in his chair as GORDON

     enters.

                               BARRETT

               Fine welcome.  These storm troopers of

               yours dragged me away from my coming-home

               party!

(beat)

               I'd like to know the meaning of this --

                               GORDON

               I'd like to know how thirty kilos of pure

               cocaine wound up concealed in your

               personal effects.

                               BARRETT

               Gordon -- I come from one of the oldest

               and most influential familles in Gotham.

               If you plan to accuse me of smuggling

               drugs, be my guest.

(long, menacing pause)

               I'll have your badge before you leave this

               room.

     GORDON weighs the threat.  He nods to the COPS in

     attendance...

                               GORDON

               Book the son of a bitch.

     GORDON storms out.  BARRETT jumps out of his chair, but the

     COPS restrain him.  Outraged, he bats their hands away...

                               BARRETT

               I believe I'm still entitled to a phone

               call.

CUT TO:

EXT. DOWNTOWN GOTHAM - DAY

     VICKI with her camera, squeezing off snaps.  She's standing

     behind a SAWHORSE, part of a crowd of onlookers at a downtown

     DEMOLITION SITE.  SURVEYORS and HARDHATS bustle about in a

     VACANT LOT, a full city block in size, fenced off and strewn

     with rubble.  The only structure still standing is a lone,

     decrepit TENEMENT BUILDING; a WRECKING BALL is poised above

     it, ready to strike.

     A SIGN at one corner of the lot announces a forty-story OFFICE

     COMPLEX soon to be erected on this site by SHAW CONSTRUCTION,

     INC.  Down below is RANDALL SHAW HIMSELF, in necktie and

     hardhat, speaking into a WALKIE-TALKIE:

                               SHAW

               Come on!  Let's move it!  We're an hour

               behind as it is!!

     A few moments later, a CLUSTER OF PEOPLE emerge from the

     tenement building -- a mixed team of COPS and CONSTRUCTION

     GOONS who are forcibly removing a DESTITUTE FAMILY from the

     condenmed building.  VICKI watches angrily...

HER POV - TELEPHOTO LENS

     A quick series of shots: the SQUATTERS wailing and struggling,

     clinging to the doorways, unwilling to leave.  Their few

     belongings are packed in a couple of CARDBOARD BOXES, which

     the cops heave rudely out onto the street.  Finally, the

     handcuffs and nightsticks come out...

ANGLE ON SHAW - THAT MOMENT - DAY

     A SURVEYOR grabs SHAW by the arm and points out the woman

     taking photos in the crowd.  SHAW recognizes her instantly.

     His face turns into a mask of outrage -- as if he's been

     personally betrayed.

                               SHAW

               Jesus Christ, that's Bruce Wayne's bimbo!

     He makes eye contact with her.  VICKI stares back defiantly.

     He's about to stroll over and tell her off when a HARDHAT

     signals to him:

                               HARDHAT

               Phone call, Mr. Shaw.  Guy said it's

               urgent.

                               SHAW

(to tbe SURVEYOR)

               Hold the ball.  I wanna hear it crash.

     He climbs into the cab of a nearby TRUCK, where he picks up a

     CELLULAR PHONE.

INTERCUT - BARRETT AND SHAW

     BARRETT's still in custody at the police station -- using his

     one phone call to contact the construction magnate.

                               BARRETT

               It's me, Randall -- Walter Barrett.  I

               want you to call my attorney.  That was 

my

shipment

 they busted up last night.

                               SHAW

               Jesus, Walter, I --

(suddenly puzzled)

               Why are you calling 

me

??

                               BARRETT

               It's worse than that.  Somebody took my

               raven.

     SHAW stares at the phone in horrified disbelief.

ANGLE ON VICKI - THAT MOMENT

     SHE WATCHES as SHAW climbs out of the truck -- numb, in a

     daze.  He signals to the WRECKING BALL OPERATOR; a WHISTLE

     blows, and the great iron ball knocks a MAMMOTH HOLE in the

     facade of the tenement.

     SHAW doesn't even stick around to watch it.  He scurries off

     to his car at the end of the block.  VICKI, highly intrigued,

     gets it all on film...

INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY

     VICKI's in a huddle with the Managing Editor, SCHULTZ, showing

     him her PHOTOS -- SHAW orchestrating the eviction of the

     SQUATTER FAMILY.

                               SCHULTZ

               Great stuff, but we're looking at a

               shitfight with our beloved publisher.  He

               and Shaw...

(crossing his fingers)

               Old money sticks together.

     VICKI points to a photo of SHAW racing from the truck to his

     car.

                               VICKI

               I'd sure like to know what shook him up

               so.  He was out of there like a scared

               rabbit...

     Just then, a reporter -- WILK -- rushes up excitedly to

     SCHULTZ's desk.

                               WILK

               Got a blind tip from downtown.  You know

               that massacre on the docks?  

Batman

.

     VICKI reacts in astonishment.  SCHULTZ's jaw drops -- this is

hot

.

                               EDITOR

               Whoa!  Is this on the level?

                               WILK

               Cops even got a note.  "Those who feed on

               the soul of Gotham will suffer my wrath!"

(grinning; to VICKI)

               Sounds like your pal's cranked it up a

               notch.

     VICKI starts to protest, but thinks better of it.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY HALL - EVENING

     ALFRED opens the door.  A BANNER HEADLINE stares him in the

     face:

BATMAN IMPLICATED IN DOCK MASSACRE

Industrialist Linked to Drug Smuggling Ring

     VICKI, who's holding up the afternoon paper for ALFRED's

     inspection, peeks out glumly from behind the masthead.

                               VICKI

               Seen the late edition?

                               ALFRED

               I'm afraid so, Miss Vale.  Master Bruce is

               sequestered in the cave.

INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING

     On their way to the Batcave, ALFRED and VICKI pass through the

     library.  They pause in front of the television -- which is

     tuned to a PANEL SHOW, with various experts discussing the hot

     issue of the day.

                               ENVIRONMENTALIST (on TV)

               Walter Barrett's no saint.  His factories

               have been dumping poison into the air and

               water for years.  If he 

is

 mixed up with

               drugs...

                               PUNDIT (on TV)

               That's not the issue.  The issue is, do we

               entrust our public safety to some...masked

               vigilante.  

Does Batman have a license to

kill

?

                               ALFRED

(shaking his head)

               Ah, the public.  Dishearteningly fickle.

     VICKI follows ALFRED out.  We HOLD on the TV as the CAMERA

     PANS OVER to the third guest on the panel, loudly demanding

     air time.  He's wearing a RED BERET and a BATMAN SWEATSHIRT:

                               MIKE SEKOWSKY (on TV)

               Yo, here's the tip, man.  Drug dealers are

scum

.  If Batman 

did

 wax these punks...SO

               WHAT?  They deserved it!  End of

               discussion.

INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING

     ALFRED and VICKI arrive; BRUCE gestures for them to keep

     quiet.  He's hunched over a TAPE RECORDER -- and COMMISSIONER

     GORDON'S VOICE is blaring from a nearby speaker...

                               GORDON (O.S.; filter)

Anyone

 could've written that note.

INT. GORDON'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT

     GORDON's in conference with a number of CITY OFFICIALS --

     blissfully unaware that anyone might be eavesdropping.

                               CITY OFFICIAL I

               And I suppose anyone could've taken out a

               boatload of armed thugs.  A dozen men, Jim

               -- murdered in cold blood --

                               GORDON

               Before we forget, Batman's saved hundreds

               of lives!

                               CITY OFFICIAL II

               He's still a vigilante.  We don't know who

               he is, where he comes from, why he does

               it...

                               CITY OFFICIAL I

               Street punks are one thing, Jim.  This is

               Walter Barrett -- a personal friend of

               mine!

     As the conversation continues, CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES IN ON a

     COMPUTER TERMINAL in the corner.  We see the tiny TRADEMARK

     embossed on the CPU -- "WAYNE TECHNOLOGIES."

INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT - ON BRUCE

     as he LISTENS through his concealed bug.

                               CITY OFFCIAL II

               You've gotta bring him in, Jim -- at least

               for questioning.  It would sure help if we

               could get that mask off...

     BRUCE shuts the recorder off.  He turns to face ALFRED and

     VICKI --

                               BRUCE

               Ladies and gentlemen...I've been framed.

CUT TO:

EXT. GOTHAM CITY - NIGHT

     The BAT-SIGNAL blazing in the night sky.  After a beat, the

     CAMERA TILTS DOWN to a cluster of EXCITED CITIZENS, who point

     and holler as the BATMOBILE streaks past.

INT. SQUAD CAR - THAT MOMENT

     TWO COPS are parked in an alleyway, watching as the BATMOBILE

     whizzes past on the street.  The DRIVER pulls out behind it as

     the second COP grabs his radio mike...

                               COP

               One-delta-niner -- 10-80 on Riverview

               north-bound at 33rd -- 10-78, repeat

               10-78.

                               VOICE ON RADIO (filter)

               10-4, one-delta-niner -- that's a 10-37,

               repeat 10-37.  Backup on the way.

EXT. STREET - ON BATMOBILE

     BARRELING TOWARD US on the street.  The SQUAD CAR gains behind

     it.  A SIREN HOWLS; a red-and-blue bubble begins to flash...

     The BATMOBILE makes a HAIRPIN TURN -- and ACCELERATES.

OVERHEAD ANGLE - THE STREETS

     As the BATMOBILE rounds the corner and picks up speed, TWO

     MORE SQUAD CARS scream down the cross street, joining in the

     pursuit.  All at once THICK BLACK SMOKE billows from the back

     of the Batmobile -- ENVELOPING the police cars, BLINDING THE

     DRIVERS...

EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     TWO SQUAD CARS parked in a V-formation -- a makeshift

     roadblock.  ANXIOUS POLICEMEN mill about in front of them.

     They move into position as the BATMOBILE, still trailing

     smoke, rounds a corner and careens directly toward them...

ANGLE ON BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT

     The FRONT FENDER of the Batmobile detaches and EXTENDS itself

     from the body of the car.  It BENDS in the middle; WING-PANELS

     flip into place, forming an arrowhead-shaped COW-CATCHER.

EXT. STREET - ON ROADBLOCK

     A SHRIEKING HORN BLARES.  The COPS see the Batmobile SPEEDING

     UP and dive for the sidewalk.  The COW-CATCHER slams into the

     SOUAD CARS, pushes them effortlessly aside, and cruises

     through the gap.

     As the PURSUING CARS emerge from the smoke cloud and follow

     the Batmobile through, we TILT UP to the roof of a nearby

     building --

EXT. ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT

     -- and realize that the Batmobile's on automatic pilot,

     because BATMAN's been on the roof all along -- watching the

     action with some dismay.

     His relationship with the Gotham PD appears to be on shaky

     ground.  He speaks into his voice-activated REMOTE CONTROL

     UNIT:

                               BATMAN

               Evasive.

     SIRENS HOWL below as he strolls across the rooftop, lost in

     thought.

CUT TO:

INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT

     At this height, the SIRENS are a distant insect drone.  We're

     in the palatial digs of RANDALL SHAW, the construction

     magnate.  There's obviously money to be made in real-estate

     development -- because the walls are lined with art, and the

     floor-to-ceiling windows open on the most spectacular view in

     Gotham.

     At the moment, SHAW's posing casually in front of his new

     Brancusi -- which rests on a pedestal near the windows.  An

     UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN in a slinky black dress LOOKS ON, her back

     to the camera...

                               WOMAN

               It's a fake.

                               SHAW

               Hmm.  It cost me a half a million dollars.

               You're sure?

                               WOMAN

               Absolutely.  You see, I...happen to know

               where the real one is stashed.

     The WOMAN wanders out of frame as SHAW smiles, impressed.  He

     seems peculiarly nonchalant about the whole deal; at the

     moment, art is not the first thing on his mind.  CAMERA STAYS

     ON HIM as he pours two glasses of red wine and circles in on

     his mysterious guest.

                               SHAW

               I guess you'd know.  I have some "friends"

               in the art world.  They say that -- for

               certain hard-to-get items -- you're the

               one to call.

                               WOMAN (O.S.)

               How flattering.

                               SHAW

               They say for the right price...you could

               steal Michelangelo off the Sistine Chapel

               Wall.

                               WOMAN (O.S.)

               Mr. Shaw.  Do you believe everything you

               hear?

                               SHAW

               Oh, I'm not one to judge.  I admire people

               who take what they want.  I'm just curious

               how you 

do

 it.

     SHAW hands her the wine, and for the first time we see her

     face.  It's SELINA KYLE, perching seductively on the arm of

     the sofa...

                               SELINA

               I find that the old methods work best.

     Setting her wine down, flashing her patented Cheshire-cat

     smile, SELINA moves in on him -- and they go into a deep,

     passionate kiss.  Her long red nails dig into his back; SHAW

     drops his wine glass, which SHATTERS -- splashing red wine

     across the polished parquet floor.

INT. PENTHOUSE - SHAW'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     The action's gone horizontal.  SELINA, peeled down to a sheer

     lace teddy, is on the bed atop SHAW -- tickling his throat

     with quick, lapping kisses.  She rolls off suddenly; when he

     tries to sit up, she pushes him back down with a single

     finger.

     Sitting on the edge of the bed, she peels off her STOCKINGS,

     twisting them around into tight cords.  With a coy smile she

     runs her finger in a circle around SHAW's hairy chest -- and

     then, abruptly, knots one stocking tightly about his wrist and

     ties it off on the bedpost.

                               SHAW

               Hey, what are you doing -- ?

     He tries to break her grip.  She BACKHANDS him sharply across

     the face.

                               SELINA

               You're very inquisitive.  You'll just have

               to be 

disciplined

.

     An EDGY SMILE spreads across his face as she binds his other

     hand to the bedpost.  None too quick, he's just caught on that

     all this is part of SELINA's kinky scene.  She crosses quickly

     to the bathroom --

                               SHAW

               You know, I've...I've never really done

               this kind of thing before.

     -- and reemerges wearing her CATWOMAN mask...which seems

     perfectly appropriate in this context.

                               SELINA

               I think people should indulge their

               fantasies.  Don't you?

     Now that he's all trussed up, she crosses the room and reaches

     into an oversized bag.  She withdraws an odd-looking chromium

     BRACE, slips it on over her wrist, and hits a trigger.  SIX-

     INCH STEEL TALONS snick into place.  SHAW's dopey smile

     fades...

                               SHAW

               Hey, what are those -- what are you --

     He lets out an awful, shrill SHRIEK as the camera WHIP PANS

     away from the bed to a Jackson Pollack on the wall nearby.  A

     SPRAY OF BLOOD spatters across it -- in an aesthetically

     pleasing way -- and the SHRIEK ends in a LOW GURGLE as we

CUT TO:

INT. BUILDING LOBBY - A FEW MINUTES LATER - NIGHT

     A SECURITY GUARD is working a crossword at his booth near the

     entrance of the building.  Behind him, a bank of MONITORS show

     various empty hallways throughout the building.  He reaches

     for his coffee and sees a RED LIGHT flashing on a wall panel

     nearby.

INT. SHAW'S PENTHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

     The penthouse is THROBBING with the clangorous sound of a

     BURGLAR ALARM.  SELINA is standing by an OPEN WALL SAFE --

     concealed behind a painting, which has been swung away on

     hinges -- and she's HOLDING HER EARS, wearing a look of

     complete exasperation: 

oh, shit

.  The GUARD'S VOICE crackles

     over a nearby intercom:

                               GUARD (O.S.; filter)

               Mr. Shaw?  What's going on up there?  --

               Mr. Shaw?

     Furious with herself, she reaches inside the safe and extracts

     a BLACK RAVEN statuette -- identical to the one she took on

     the docks.  She slams the door shut and swings the picture

     back into place.

EXT. STREETS - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     SIRENS echo in the streets.  SQUAD CARS make sudden turns and

     streak off toward SHAW's building.

EXT. ROOFTOP - HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT

     Watching the cars from his rooftop vantage, BATMAN raises an

     ANTENNA mounted on his utility belt and cups one hand to his

     head.  An EARPIECE concealed inside his cowl gives him the

     police frequency:

                               DISPATCHER (O.S.; filter)

               -- possible 15 in progress, 188 E. 69th at

               Gotham Park West.  Move out.  It's Randall

               Shaw.  Repeat, all units --

     BATMAN's eyes widen.  He steps to the ledge and pulls a TINY

     METAL CYLINDER from his belt -- immediately recognizable as

     part of BRUCE's hydraulic umbrella-gizmo.

     But it's no umbrella.  When BATMAN thumbs the switch, his

     BLACK CAPE begins to SPREAD and RISE -- stiffening, expanding

     -- INFLATING itself into a pair of RIGID BLACK BATWINGS.

     He steps OFF THE LEDGE, INTO MIDAIR -- SOARING SILENTLY ACROSS

     THE STREET LIKE A HUMAN HANG-GLIDER as the cop cars cruise

     past far below.

INT. SHAW'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     There's an awful BANGING at the front door.  SHAW lies under

     the bloody sheets, hands folded, staring lifelessly up at the

     ceiling.  SELINA, now dressed in full Catwoman regalia, slings

     a lightweight KNAPSACK over her shoulders.  She picks up the

     nearest chair, RAMS IT through SHAW's plate-glass window, and

     clambers out onto the ledge outside.

     Ten seconds later the COPS burst in.  They rush to the bedroom

     -- spot the shattered window, the inert gory mass on the

     bed --

     -- but the 

real

 shock comes when they glance over at the wall.

     Painted there, in blood...is a big, red, dripping BAT.

                               COP

               JESUS!

EXT. ROOFTOP - SHAW'S BUILDING - NIGHT

     Forty stories up.  The CATWOMAN, in a surefooted crouch, she

     scurries along the ledge -- SPRINGS at a cornice -- and in one

     lithe motion VAULTS UP onto the ROOF.  She scampers across the

     rooftops, dropping from one to the next with rope and tackle,

     like a mountain climber --

     -- until she reaches the building at the end of the block.

     Here she pauses to dig in her knapsack.  She pulls out a

     retractable HOOK at the end of a rope, swings it around,

     HEAVES IT at the rooftop across the street...

EXT. STREET BELOW - LOW ANGLE - THAT MOMENT

     POLICE pile out of cars and race for the entrance, totally

     oblivious to the odd scene taking place overhead -- where the

     small, barely-visible figure of a WOMAN, clad entirely in

     black leather, is doing a TIGHTROPE WALK across the

     intersection.

EXT. ROOFTOP - A MINUTE LATER - NIGHT

     The CATWOMAN bounds across snowy rooftops until she decides

     she's out of danger.  Then, weary and exhilarated, she drops

     to her knees; bathed in moonlight, she preens, stretches,

     emits eerie little purrs and hisses of pleasure.  She's just

     made a kill and her blood is running high, so she's stopped

     for a moment of Quality Time.

     She hears an odd crunching noise two roofs over.  Her whole

     body tenses and -- though her head doesn't move -- her eyes

     dart left.

     A CAPED SHADOW has just touched down at the end of a line.

     The gold BAT-EMBLEM on his chest is visible for the briefest

     of seconds before he steps back into the shadows.  She acts

     like she hasn't noticed...

     ...but a little smile flickers across her lips just the same.

TIGHT ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT

     His eyes widen -- his LIPS PART as he watches her.  If it's

     possible to see absolute consternation behind that mask, we're

     seeing it now.

HIS POV - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT

     She still doesn't let on that she's seen him.  Instead, she

     goes to the ledge of the roof and begins to STRUT, like a

     gymnast on the balance beam -- POSING for him in a little

     private show -- a strange, self-infatuated, AUTOEROTIC DANCE

     ROUTINE for BATMAN's benefit.

EXT. ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT

     His jaw is down around his knees.  

Whoa

.  He edges forward

     slightly, as if hypnotically drawn to her...

     She hears a noise.  Stops.  Makes a big show of looking left

     and right.  Somehow afraid she'll see him watching, BATMAN

     jumps back into the shadows.  She gathers her things; a small

     WHITE CARD flutters from her knapsack to the snowy roof, and

     she VANISHES over the edge.

     Snapping back to reality, he bolts across the roof just in

     time to see --

EXT. SIDE OF BUILDING - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     She's rapidly working her way down the side of the building,

     flipping down from one fire escape to tile next -- a master

     gymnast.  Three stories up, she lands on a railing, then STOPS

     -- LAUNCHING HERSELF out over the street, making a perfect

     landing on the roof of a passing BUS.

EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     BATMAN turns -- and his eyes fall on the WHITE CARD.  He

     kneels to pick it up; a brief three-word MESSAGE is scrawled

     upon it...

LOOKING FOR LOVE?

     He goes goggle-eyed with astonishment.  He rushes back to the

     edge of the roof and sees the BUS just turning toward the

     entrance to Gotham Park.  He's reaching for his grappling-gun,

     figuring to follow, when a FLOODLIGHT catches him full in the

     face.

EXT. STREETS BELOW - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     Down below, the cops are sweeping their beams across the

     rooftops.  Two of them catch a quick glimpse of BATMAN just as

     he ducks back behind the cornice, out of view.

                               COP

               Hey.  You see what I saw...?

     This sends the astounded COPS rushing to their radios.  Right

     on cue, COMMISSIONER GORDON's car pulls up.  LT. BULLOCK,

     who's already on the scene, fills him in as he climbs out.

                               BULLOCK

               It's Randall Shaw.  Torn to ribbons.  --

               We just made Batman up on the roof.

                               GORDON

               Oh God.

EXT. GOTHAM PARK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The BUS rumbles deeper into the snowy park.  A BLACK

     SILHOUETTE springs off the roof into the trees, disappearing

     among the branches...

     We TRACK WITH the bus as it moves through the park, arriving

     finally at:

EXT. CLEARING IN PARK - SHANTYTOWN - NIGHT

     The little colony of HOMELESS PEOPLE in their cardboard shacks

     and lean-tos, still occupying the future site of the Park

     Towers.  MARCHERS and PICKETERS are continuing their protest

     nearby, and some charitable organization's set up a makeshift

     soup kitchen on folding tables -- hot coffee and sandwiches.

     VICKI's on the periphery of the camp, camera in hand.  She's

     trying to persuade a HOMELESS MAN to let his picture be taken.

                               VICKI

               Please, just one.  It's important for

               people to see what's happening.

                               HOMELESS MAN

               They don't want to see us, lady.  They

               just want us 

gone

 -- out of sight, and out

               of mind.

(mumbling as he wanders off)

               Get worse before it gets better.  It

               always does.

     VICKI TURNS.  In the distance, the PICKETERS are shrieking and

     wailing.  A VAN's just pulled up to the edge of the park, and

     a dozen HARDHATS are elbowing their way through the crowd.

     All at once they're swarming through shantytown with TIRE

     IRONS and BASEBALL BATS, overturning the sandwich tables,

     RIPPING DOWN the shabby tents and lean-tos.

     Some of the HOMELESS PEOPLE run.  Those who resist meet with

     swift and sudden violence.  A MARCHER jumps a hardhat, and

     gets a baseball bat in the gut for his trouble.

     VICKI waits for the police sirens, but 

they don't come

.  She

     backs off toward the trees, she begins SNAPPING PHOTOS

     FRANTICALLY, capturing the carnage on film.

     A HARDHAT is dismantling a lean-to with his tire iron --

     sending the terrified family inside scurrying off into the

     snow -- when he glances up and sees VICKI taking his picture.

     He points her out to a colleague...

     ...and suddenly the two of them are RUSHING TOWARD HER with

     pure cold malice in their eyes.  VICKI turns to run, but it's

     slow going in the snow.  She SLIPS and FALLS; her attackers

     are almost upon her...

     ...when a SHADOWY FIGURE DIVES OUT OF THE TREES and TACKLES

     one of the HARDHATS.  The FIGURE lands a powerhouse blow to

     the fallen HARDHATs jaw, knocking him out cold.

     The second HARDHAT turns and lifts his TIRE IRON.  But the

     FIGURE, with surprising agility, is already rolling out of the

     way.  As he rolls, he grabs the first guy's HARDHAT off his

     head and brings it up in front of him -- blocking the blow

     from the second guy's tire iron.

     In the same motion, he plants a FOOT in the second HARDHAT's

     belly and sends him REELING BACKWARD, HARDHAT II drops the

     tire iron, and the FIGURE snatches it out of midair as he gets

     to his feet.  He moves in on the second HARDHAT, BRANDISHING

     the iron --

     -- and while HARDHAT II is staring at it, the FIGURE HIGH-

     KICKS HIM in the face.  HOP; KICK.  HOP; KICK.  The FIGURE has

     nailed him three times squarely on the jaw before he can hit

     the ground.

     The FIGURE turns toward VICKI.  Her eyes go wide with

     astonishment.

     It's a KID, thirteen or fourteen at the outside, sunken-eyed,

     grimy-looking, in a torn-and-tattered RAINCOAT.  She stares at

     him for the briefest of instants before he rushes off to the

     aid of his fellow homeless...

     She can't believe what she's seeing.  The KID wades smack into

     the midst of the remaining HARDHATS, and 

kicks ass

 --

     spinning, pirouetting, kicking, clawing in a furious display

     of pure athleticism.  It seems like he's everywhere at once.

     There's only one other guy in Gotham City who can handle

     himself like this...

     Rallying behind him, the MARCHERS and HOMELESS PEOPLE snatch

     bats and tire irons from the fallen HARDHATS -- and the tide

     turns.  The invasion is being repelled.  Faced with renewed

     resistance, the few HARDHATS still left standing TURN TAIL and

     race off to their VAN.

     Triumph in shantytown.  The MARCHERS and HOMELESS cluster

     together to lick their wounds -- and the KID, satisfied that

     everything is under control, turns and sprints off toward the

     trees.

     But one prostrate HARDHAT is only playing dead.  As the KID

     runs past, the HARDHAT extends a TIRE IRON into his path --

     TRIPPING HIM, sending him sprawling in the snow.  The KID

     throws up his hands as the HARDHAT prepares to smash down at

     him...

     CLANG.  The HARDHAT drops his tire iron and topples over,

     BOARDLIKE.  The KID looks up and sees VICKI standing there

     with a baseball bat.

     He gives her a quick nod of acknowledgement as he gets to his

     feet -- thanks for returning the favor.  He's about to light

     out again when --

                               VICKI

WAIT

!  Don't be afraid.  I wanted to 

thank

               you.  I --

                               KID

(cautiously)

               Twenty.

                               VICKI

               What?

                               KID

               Twenty bucks.

     VICKI's mildly taken aback, but she reaches for her purse just

     the same.  She's barely gotten her wallet open when the KID

     snatches the bill out of her hands.  They stare at each other

     for a long moment --

                               VICKI

               ...Who 

are

 you?

                               KID

               Dick.

     -- and then he's bounding off like a shot.  VAULTING up into a

     tree and vanishing amid the snowy branches.  VICKI starts to

     follow, but there's no way she can keep up.  Instead she digs

     into her CAMERA BAG...

HER POV - THROUGH TELEPHOTO LENS

     Using the long lens, she tracks the KID's progress through the

     treetops.  She can't actually see him, but occasional chunks

     of SNOW and ICE are falling to the ground as he jumps from

     limb to limb...

     For a moment it seems like she's lost him.  As she sweeps the

     lens back and forth, scanning the trees, she catches sight of

     an EQUESTRIAN STATUE in the distance.  She ups the

     magnification so she can see the plaque on the pedestal.  The

     stone figure on the horse is Union war hero GEN. OLIVER WAYNE

     -- BRUCE's great-grandfather.

     As luck would have it, the KID drops to earth not ten feet

     from the statue -- VICKI's got him in her sights again.  He

     looks around cautiously to make sure no one's following, then

     races toward a STONE BRIDGE which arches between two small

     hillocks, over a frozen creek.

     There's a DRAINAGE TUNNEL, four or five feet in diameter,

     mounted in the bridge abutment, the KID pries off a wire grate

     and clambers inside, then pulls the grate back into place

     behind him.  Home sweet home.

EXT. PARK - ON VICKI - NIGHT

     as she lowers the lens.  Her face is full of conflicting

     emotions.  She'd love to corner this boy vigilante and find

     out what his story is.  But on the other hand -- even the

     homeless are entitled to their privacy...

CUT TO:

INT. PENGUIN'S AVIARY - NIGHT

     A CANARY sings in its cage as a BLACK CAT watches transfixed

     from a nearby chair.  The cat arches its back -- waits -- and

     SPRINGS AT THE CAGE, BATTING at it in midair.  The canary

     SHRIEKS; the cat YOWLS; a WOMAN snatches it up off the floor,

     cradles it in her arms...

                               WOMAN'S VOICE

               Now Hecate.  You don't want that scrawny

               little bird --

     It's SELINA, looking ripe and slinky in a sheer black

     ensemble.  At the desk behind her is the PENGUIN, in his

     customary cutaway and waist-coat, polishing his new RAVEN.  He

     bares his teeth:

                               PENGUIN

               Do you want me to wring that creature's

               neck?

                               SELINA

               You try it, I'll do the same to you.

(as he grumbles; bemused)

               I saw him, you know.

                               PENGUIN

               Saw who?

                               SELINA

               Batman.  He was 

dreamy

.

     She strokes the cat, in a reverie.  The PENGUIN drops his

     polishing cloth, startled.

                               PENGUIN

Dreamy

?!?  Are you insane!?  My God --

(sputtering wildly)

               Are you sure it was 

him

?  What did he do?

                               SELINA

               He stood on a roof and watched me.  He

               didn't realize I'd seen him.  I don't

               think he knew quite what to make of me.

(smiling)

               But he was definitely interested.

     This sends the PENGUIN into a frantic round of pacing.  (Or

     waddling.)

                               PENGUIN

               This scheme of yours is backfiring.  We

               don't need 

him

 on our tails.  Do you know

               how much 

money

 is at stake here?

                               SELINA

               Money isn't everything.

(casually)

               What's the point if we can't enjoy

               ourselves?

     She chuckles to herself.  He stares at her in disbelief -- and

     SQUAWKS.

CUT TO:

EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - MORNING

     The big SIGN over Gotham Square tells us there are only 9

     shopping days left until Christmas.  Down below, BRUCE is

     walking VICKI to work.

                               VICKI

               Six-on-one, and he took 'em all out...then

               vanished into a drainage pipe -- right

               next to the statue of General Wayne.

                               BRUCE

               My illustrious great-grandfather.  Think

               it's the same kid we heard about?

                               VICKI

               Must be.  He reminded me of 

you

.

     BRUCE chuckles. They pass a NEWSSTAND just outside the 

Globe

     building, pausing to stare at the headlines -- which SCREAM:

NEW BAT-MURDER?

Batman Suspect in Slaying of Millionaire Developer

Commissioner Gordon Refuses Comment

     The accompanying photo is a full-color spread of the BLOODY

     RED BAT painted on SHAW's wall.  BRUCE scowls at VICKI:

                               BRUCE

               -- You 

work

 for this rag?

(snatching up a paper)

               Your boss is calling for Gordon's

               resignation -- unless he brings Batman in

               for questioning...

     VICKI nudges BRUCE and points at a STOREFRONT across the

     street.

THEIR POV - SOUVENIR SHOP

     The owner is in the store window, hastily removing all of his

     Batman merchandise and setting up new displays devoted to

     TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES and THE SIMPSONS.  A MOTHER drags

     her squirming TODDLER past the entrance -- the kid smells

     heavy markdowns on Bat-shit, but Mom clearly doesn't

     approve...

BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND VICKI

     looking on in dismay.  BRUCE crumples the paper in outrage:

                               BRUCE

               I need a good PR man.

                               NEWS VENDOR

               Hey, pal -- you buyin' or borrowin'?

     With a sullen look, BRUCE tosses the paper back on the rack.

     VICKI pulls him off toward the entrance of the 

Globe

.

                               VICKI

               That's what happens when you go after the

               rich and powerful.

                               BRUCE

               Hey, it 

wasn't me

, remember?  I 

am

 rich

               and powerful --

     As he's talking, BRUCE glances back at the newsstand.  He sees

     an AD FLYER tacked up on one side -- "LOOKING FOR LOVE?  Find

     it in the GOTHAM GLOBE PERSONALS."

Looking for Love

.  Eyes widening, he digs in his pocket for a

     quarter and races back to the newsstand.  VICKI keeps

     walking...

                               VICKI

               Maybe it's almost...good.  In a weird way.

               I mean, Shaw, and Barrett -- if people

               like that were really 

scared

, maybe

               they'd --

     She suddenly realizes she's talking to herself.  She turns

     around and sees BRUCE back at the newsstand, hurriedly

     unfolding a copy of the 

Globe

.  She marches back and tugs at

     his sleeve.

                               VICKI (cont.)

               Hey, I'm late for work.  You can read that

               later.

                               BRUCE

               Quiet.  I'm looking for a personal ad.

     Her face screws up in confusion as BRUCE frantically scans the

     page.

                               BRUCE (cont.)

               "Tall, Dark And Handsome -- You saw me on 

               the roof 12/16.  I was in black; you were

               too."

                               VICKI

               Is this some kind of bad joke?

                               BRUCE

               It's her.  That 

cat

 woman, or whatever she

               is.

(reading aloud)

               "I jumped a bus into Gotham Park hoping

               you'd follow, but you were too shy..."

                               VICKI

               What does she want -- a date?

                               BRUCE

               She's trying to contact me.  Says she's

               gonna leave me another ad...

     The two of them exchange a look of utter perplexity.  BRUCE's

     mind is racing; he seems bizarrely 

aroused

 -- in a way that

     makes VICKI just a trifle nervous...

INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY

     VICKI arrives at her desk and sets her portfolio down.  She

     spots a message in the "in" file.  She takes one look at it,

     and her eyes go wide with RAGE.  She storms out in a fury...

INT. PUBLISHER'S OFFICE - A MINUTE LATER - DAY

     Barging past a phalanx of SECRETARIES, VICKI bursts into the

     inner office of HARRISON J. PROVOST, publisher of the 

Globe

.

     He's just opening his mail.  He heaves a weary sigh as VICKI

     BARKS at him:

                               VICKI

               WHY DID YOU KILL MY STORY?

                               PROVOST

               Close the door.

(waiting for her to calm down)

               Your story isn't 

news

.  With Shaw dead --

                               VICKI

               But the project's still going ahead!  If

               attacking homeless people in the park

               isn't news, I'd like to know what is --

                               PROVOST

               There's a 

psycho

 out there in a mask and

               cape -- killing off Gotham's most

               prominent citizens!  

That's

 news.

(beat)

               I've known Randall Shaw all my life.  His

               family is in mourning.  And it just so

               happens I don't believe in slandering the

dead

.

     VICKI FUMES.  She turns and stares PROVOST straight in the

     eye.

                               VICKI

               Mr. Provost -- how much money do you have

               tied up in the Park Tower project?

                               PROVOST

               Vicki...I'm going to forget you made that

               remark.  For the sake of your job, I

               suggest you do the same.

     VICKI stalks of -- and PROVOST goes back to his mail.  He

     finds an envelope addressed in a shaky, psychotic scrawl, with

     the word "CONFIDENTIAL" underlined three times in ink.  He

     tears it open --

     -- and HIS FACE TURNS PALE as he stares down at the contents:

     a small business-sized card, signed with a BAT-EMBLEM...

THOSE WHO FEED ON THE SOUL OF GOTHAM

WILL SUFFER MY WRATH

CUT TO:

EXT. GOTHAM HALL OF JUSTICE - DAY

     WALTER BARRETT and his ATTORNEY emerge onto the front steps of

     the courthouse.  BARRETT is instantly mobbed by REPORTERS.

                               REPORTER I

               Mr. Barrett!  Any comment on the

               arraignment?

                               REPORTER II

               Is it true bail was set at two million

               dollars?

                               ATTORNEY

               Stand back!  My client has nothing to say

               at this time!

     The ATTORNEY clears a path for BARRETT, who climbs into a

     waiting CAR, shielding his face.  REPORTERS cluster around

     it...

     As the car pulls out into traffic, we see a flock of PIGEONS

     taking wing from their perches on the statues outside the Hall

     of Justice.

OVERHEAD SHOT - ON BARRETT'S CAR

     PIGEONS fill the frame, swooping down toward the CAR, which is

     idling at a traffic light far below.

INT. BARRETT'S CAR - THAT MOMENT

     The liveried DRIVER drums his fingers as he waits for the

     light to change.  BARRETT's in the back, speaking into his

     cellular phone.

                               BARRETT

               It's time we called an emergency meeting

               of the Raven Society.  Get back to me...

     Looking troubled, he hangs up.  A fat white glob of PIGEON

     SHIT splatters across the windshield.  Seconds later --

     another SPLAT.

                               BARRETT (cont.)

               Damn pigeons.

                               DRIVER

               Just washed it, too.

     The DRIVER reaches for the wiper switch.  They hear a tiny

     DINK as a SOLID PELLET bounces off the windshield.

     BARRETT and the DRIVER exchange a mystified look.  A small,

     blinking CAPSULE has just lodged in the wiper-blade

     assembly...

OVERHEAD SHOT - ON BARRETT'S CAR

     Just as the light changes, the CAR EXPLODES into a million

     fragments -- leaving a BLACKENED CRATER in the middle of the

     intersection.

CUT TO:

INT. BATCAVE - DAY

     TIGHT ON A VIDEO MONITOR -- showing FIRE TRUCKS in the

     intersection we've just left, hosing down the wreckage of

     BARRETT's car.  BRUCE is watching intently when ALFRED appears

     behind him.

                               ALFRED

               The Fluegelheim called again, sir.  They

               want to know if you'll be attending the

               opening of the new Egyptian exhibit.

     BRUCE, still engrossed in his news broadcast, waves ALFRED

     off.

                               BRUCE

Cancel

.

                               ANCHORWOMAN (on TV)

               -- and, citing new evidence in the so-

               called string of "millionaire murders,"

               Police Commissioner J.T. Gordon today

               swore out a warrant for the arrest of

               Batman.

(beat)

               We go now live to Mike Sekowsky,

               spokesperson, Order of the Bat.

                               SEKOWSKY

               Jeez!  Talk about 

gratitude

 -- !!

     At the sight of SEKOWSKY's face, BRUCE kills the sound in

     disgust.  ALFRED looks on helplessly as he paces the floor of

     the Batcave.

                               BRUCE

               Well, Alfred, it's official.  I'm a wanted

               man.

(beat)

               "New evidence"...I've gotta find that

               woman.  Did you check the personals?

     As ALFRED shakes his head no, a BUZZER sounds.  They've got a

     visitor.  BRUCE hits a switch on a monitor, and sees

     COMMISSIONER GORDON'S CAR sitting outside the wrought-iron

     gates of Wayne Manor.

     He throws a nervous look at ALFRED.  ALFRED speaks into a

     microphone:

                               ALFRED

               Who's there?

                               GORDON

               Jim Gordon, Alfred.  I've got to see

               Bruce.

     A spooky development.  Does GORDON suspect?  After a moment's

     hesitation, BRUCE nods to ALFRED -- let him in.

                               ALFRED

               Mr. Wayne will see you, sir.

INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER

     A curious BRUCE ushers GORDON into the library, gestures

     toward the liquor cabinet.  The Commissioner nods his head no.

     He's fidgety, ill at ease -- he obviously doesn't want to be

     here.

                               GORDON

               Sorry to bother you.  Bruce -- I'll get

               right down to it.  You knew Shaw and

               Barrett --

                               BRUCE

               I saw them occasionally.  We all sat on

               the board of the Fluegelheim...

                               GORDON

               Did you have any...dealings with them,

               or --

                               BRUCE

               No.  I never liked the way they did

               business.

                               GORDON

               The thing is, Bruce, you're all lumped

               together in the public mind -- the Five

               Families of Gotham, that sort of thing --

               and, uh...

(taking a card from his pocket)

               Harrison Provost got this in the mail.

     BRUCE examines the card, -- "THOSE WHO FEED," etc.  He stares

     at GORDON in mock-concern, playing it close to the vest...

                               BRUCE

               Then Batman 

is

 behind all this.

                               GORDON

               Batman or a damned good imitation.

                               BRUCE

               Well.  He's changed tactics, hasn't he.

                               GORDON

(shrugging; at a loss)

               Shaw, with his high-rises -- Barrett, a

               druglord, major polluter -- they weren't

               exactly model citizens.  Who knows, it

               could be some crazy social-conscience kind

               of thing.

                               BRUCE

               You mean he's going after...the root of

               the problem.

     GORDON shakes his head and gets up to go.  BRUCE hands him the

     card.

                               GORDON

               Let me know if you get one of these.

               We'll put all our resources at your

               disposal.

     BRUCE nods thoughtfully as ALFRED appears to see the

     Commissioner out.  A moment later, the butler reappears.

                               BRUCE

               Changed my mind, Alfred.  I'll be dropping

               in on the Fluegelheim after all.

CUT TO:

INT. FLUEGELHEIM MUSEUM - NIGHT

     It's a party to celebrate the opening of the new Egyptian

     exhibit, and the Fluegelheim is hopping.  BOARD MEMBERS,

     MUSEUM PATRONS, and SOCIALITES mill about in dinner jackets

     and evening gowns, making small talk.  AN OPEN SARCOPHAGUS has

     been set up as a wet bar.

     On a raised concrete platform in the center of the hall,

     rimmed by a decorative moat, sits an ancient Egyptian SHRINE.

     The TEMPLE OF BASTET has been moved to Gotham and

     reconstructed in the Fluegelheim --sandstone walls, fountains,

     statuary and all.

     Guarding the entrance is a stately bronze statue of the

     goddess BASTET -- who has the body of a woman and the head of

     a pointy-eared CAT.  She holds an aegis and a sistrum; four

     tiny KITTENS romp at her feet.  BRUCE, who's just arrived, is

     taking an intense interest in the cat-goddess...

                               VICKI

               What is it?

                               BRUCE

               I just had a weird sense of 

deja vu

.

     He glances over by the sarcophagus and sees PROVOST, the

     publisher, huddle with ELIOT TIPTREE III, transit magnate --

     the remaining member of Gotham's "Five Families."  The two of

     them are engaged in some urgent conversation which he can't

     quite make out...

                               TIPTREE

               Harrison -- we really ought to warn Bruce.

               We owe him that much.

     BRUCE detaches himself from VICKI and strolls toward them.

     PROVOST and TIPTREE force smiles and wave, affecting an air of

     nonchalance.

                               PROVOST (cont.)

               The man's a space cadet.  Let him look out

               for himself.

(as BRUCE arrives; cheerfully)

               Why, Bruce!  What a delightful surprise.

                               BRUCE

               Good to see you two.  Looks like the Five

               Families are suddenly down to three.

(looking around)

               In fact, if somebody dropped a bomb on

               this room right now --

     TIPTREE chuckles nervously.  PROVOST is even 

less

 amused.

                               PROVOST

               Is that your idea of a joke, Bruce?

                               BRUCE

               Not at all.  Commissioner Gordon seems to

               think we should all be hiring bodyguards.

               TIPTREE                           PROVOST

     Oh, that's absurd.                I already have.

     The two of them glower at each other.  It's like an outtake

     from 

The Newlywed Game

.  BRUCE shrugs it off and makes a

     vacuous face:

                               BRUCE

               Thing is, I can't imagine why Batman would

               be after us.  Can you?

     PROVOST and TIPTREE are about to go into another round of

     hemming-and-hawing when a NEW FACE joins the party.  It's

     SELINA KYLE -- stunning as ever in an extravagantly revealing

     dress slit up to the armpits.  She's holding two glasses of

     CHAMPAGNE...

                               SELINA

               You two look like you need a drink.  --

               And is this who I think it is?

     She flashes BRUCE her most winning, seductive, heavy-artillery

     SMILE.  He BLINKS, temporarily speechless.

                               PROVOST

               Selina Kyle -- Bruce Wayne.

                               SELINA

               Our absentee board member!  I've been

               wanting to meet you 

forever

.

                               TIPTREE

               Selina's the new Curator of Antiquities.

               She brought the Temple over block by

               block --

                               SELINA

               You two won't be terribly upset if I

               borrow Bruce for a moment, will you?

     Before he can protest, she's linked an arm around his and

     dragged him off.  A nearby FAT MAN spots SELINA, wiggles his

     eyebrows and WAVES BRIGHTLY.  His tongue is practically

     hanging out -- he's just dying to write her a check.  SELINA

     SIGHS WEARILY to BRUCE:

                               SELINA (cont.)

               Major contributor.  -- I always seem to

               wind up in charge of fund-raising...

                               BRUCE

               I can't imagine why.

                               SELINA

               Tax year's almost over, you know.  I hope

               we can count on your usual generous

               donation.

(indicating PROVOST and TIPTREE)

               Someone's got to set an example for those

               two tightwads.

                               BRUCE

               They're proccupied.  This string of

               murders --

                               SELINA

               I asked them if they'd consider including

               us in their wills.

(chuckling to herself)

               They didn't seem a 

bit

 amused...

ANGLE ON VICKI - THAT MOMENT

     She's making small talk with a bunch of STUFFED SHIRTS and

     their overdressed WIVES.  She glances across the room at the

     statue of Bastet, sees SELINA draped all over BRUCE.  A frown

     crosses her face...

ANGLE ON BRUCE AND SELINA - THAT MOMENT

     She's still clinging to his arm as they stare up at the

     statue.

                               SELINA

               -- and this is my good friend Bastet, the

               Egyptian Cat Goddess.

                               BRUCE

               I think we've already met.  -- This is

               quite an expedition you've put together.

                               SELINA

               I'm glad you think so.  I have to say,

               Bruce -- you're not at 

all

 what I

               expected.

                               BRUCE

               Sorry to disappoint you.

                               SELINA

               Oh, it's not that.  Not at 

all

.  It's just

               that I'd always heard you were...

                               BRUCE

               What?

                               SELINA

(coyly)

               Oh...sort of a...

                               BRUCE

(smiling; fascinated)

               No.  Come on.  What?

     BRUCE's state of mounting infatuation is abruptly shattered

     when VICKI sidles up alongside him and -- territorially --

     takes his 

other

 arm.  The women exchange big, toothy, plastic

     smiles; stranded in the middle, BRUCE realizes they're waiting

     for him to introduce them.

                               BRUCE

               Oh.  Selina Kyle -- my friend Vicki Vale.

                               SELINA

               The photographer.  I've seen your pictures

               in the 

Gazette

.

                               VICKI

               The 

Globe

.

                               SELINA

               Oh, that's right.  The 

tabloid

 one.  --

               What an original dress!

     VICKI, still smiling, cocks an eyebrow at BRUCE.  He senses

     trouble coming and tries to head it off at the pass.

                               BRUCE

               Selina supervised the reconstruction of

               the temple.  Brought it back from Egypt...

               stone by stone.

                               VICKI

               Really.  She must be 

awfully

 tired.

(to SELINA)

               How'd you get to be in charge of a huge

               project like this?

                               SELINA

               It was easy.  I slept with the Pharoah.

     She laughs at her own joke.  VICKI responds with a dry little

     chuckle of her own.  SELINA gives BRUCE a SHARP YANK on the

     sleeve.

                               SELINA (cont.)

               Excuse us, won't you, sweetheart?  We have

               some boring museum business to talk about.

     VICKI fumes.  BRUCE shrugs apologetically as SELINA drags him

     off out of earshot.

                               SELINA (cont.)

               I.  Short leash.

                               BRUCE

               Pull in the claws, okay?  She's really

               terrific.

                               SELINA

               I'm sorry, Bruce.  Sometimes I get a

               little...aggressive, you know?

(handing him a card)

               Look, I need to talk to you.  Come by

               sometime.  I'll give you the private tour.

                               BRUCE

               Wait.  Let me explain about Vicki --

                               SELINA

(shushing him)

               I understand.  Anyone who's that

               protective must have a pretty good reason

               for it.

     She shoots him one last smile -- sly, conspiratorial,

     unmistakably 

juicy

.  Then she's off in pursuit of another

     major funder.  BRUCE is thoughtfully turning the card over in

     his hands when VICKI rejoins him.

                               VICKI

               How's "business"?

                               BRUCE

               Relax, okay?  I like you better.

     He scans the room, trying to find PROVOST and TIPTREE.  No

     luck.

                               VICKI

               If you're looking for your fellow

               millionaires, they left some time back.

CUT TO:

INT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

     The roof of the Gotham 

Globe

.  A STARLING circles overhead for

     a moment -- then DIVES down an exposed VENTILATION SHAFT.

INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - THAT MOMENT

     TWO ARMED BODYGUARDS are standing watch outside an office.

     Brass letters on the door read "J. HARRISON PROVOST,

     PUBLISHER."

INT. PROVOST'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT

     PROVOST, agitated, working late.  He speaks, 

sotto voce

, into

     the phone:

                               PROVOST

               Don't worry about that.  I've had the

               office swept for bugs.  No one's

               listening...

INT. TIPTREE'S LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     TIPTREE in his paneled study at home.  There's an open bottle

     on the table and he's been hitting the sauce -- hard.  His

     VOICE QUAVERS:

                               TIPTREE

               It's just so -- unfair.  I mean...it was

               over a century ago.  It's not like 

we're

               responsible.

(hollow-eyed)

               How could he 

know

?  How could Batman know

               about the Raven Society??

INT. OFFICE - ON PROVOST - THAT MOMENT

                               PROVOST

               Who knows and who cares.  The point is,

               it's happened...

     He hears a CHIRP and looks up.  It seems to be coming from a

     HEATING VENT on the wall.  But then it stops, so he resumes

     his conversation --

                               PROVOST (cont.)

               I'm clearing out of the country, and I'm

               taking the raven with me.  I suggest you

               do the same.

INT. HEATING VENT - THAT MOMENT

     In the metal shaft on the other side of the grate is a tiny

     BIRD -- the same one we saw flying down the air shaft.  Now

     that we've got a close-up view, we can see the thin BATTERY

     PACK wired to its underbelly...and the MINIATURE MICROPHONE

     taped to its leg.

                               PROVOST (O.S.)

               I'll tell you how to reach me.  And don't

               repeat this to 

anyone

.

CUT TO:

INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - DAY

     The PENGUIN stands over his indoor penguin pool.  He's wearing

     rubber gloves, feeding LIVE FISH from an ice chest to his

     arctic birds.  The vents in the windows are open, and the

     climate in the room is downright icy as SELINA's wrapped in

     fur, stroking her pet cat:

                               SELINA

               He's just another rich idiot.

(chuckling to herself)

               The odd thing is, he didn't seem a bit

               concerned.

                               PENGUIN

               Then he is 

an

 idiot.

                               SELINA

               He lives in some big sprawling manor.

               I'll have to get inside, scope it out...

               see where he's got the raven stashed.

                               PENGUIN

               How do you plan to do that?

                               SELINA

               How do you think!

     A feline smile from SELINA.  The PENGUIN chuckles to himself,

     lobs a FISH out over the pool.  A swooping GULL snatches it

     out of the air before it hits the water.  FRICK arrives in the

     doorway.

                               FRICK

               It's Mr. Provost, sir.  He's planning to

               embark on an unscheduled Christmas

               vacation.

                               PENGUIN

               Good!  That should save us a trip to the

               bank.

CUT TO:

INT. FLUEGELHEIM - BACK ROOM - DAY

     A huge open room cluttered with all kinds of junk:

     archaeologist's tools, restoration equipment, etc., plus a

     healthy assortment of curios and oddities from all over.  This

     is SELINA's private domain.  CAMERA TRACKS past a glass case

     full of ugly, withered, turdlike specimens...

                               BRUCE

               What have we got here?

                               SELINA

               Mummified cats.  Bastet's sacred animal.

               They were buried by the thousands at

               Bubastis.  -- Oh, careful!

     BRUCE FREEZES with his hand poised over a set of four earthen

     JARS.  Each has a lid carved in the shape of a HEAD: ape,

     jackal, man, falcon.

                               SELINA (cont.)

               Canopic jars.  In the process of

               mummification, the internal organs were

               buried separately.

(pointing to each jar in turn)

               Lungs -- stomach -- liver -- intestine --

     BRUCE withdraws his hand with a bemused shudder.

                               BRUCE

               You're in a gruesome line of work.

                               SELINA

               Keeps me interested.  And that's not easy

               to do...

     BRUCE's attention turns to a crumbling statuette of an odd

     beast: a WINGED LION with the head of a FALCON.

                               BRUCE

               This one I know.  It's a gryphon, right?

                               SELINA

               Very good.  A mythical demon, half-bird,

               half-lion...sweeping down from the sky to

               deliver retribution and justice.

     BRUCE nods.  He can dig it.  He regards the gryphon for a long

     moment and CHUCKLES.

                               BRUCE

               Poor guy.  Birds and cats -- you wouldn't

               think the two halves would cooperate.

                               SELINA

               Only under certain circumstances.

(beat)

               I'm really glad you came, Bruce.  I was

               afraid I'd given you the wrong impression.

               Or maybe it was the right impression.

                               BRUCE

               What was it you wanted to talk to me

               about?

                               SELINA

               Your 

collection

.  I'd love to see it.  I

               mean, everyone says you've got a

               fabulous --

     She breaks off in midstream and chuckles to herself.  She toys

     demurely with her equipment.  She looks up at BRUCE and

     switches tactics -- going for the direct approach.  BRUCE

     braces himself...

                               SELINA (cont.)

               Mainly I just wanted an excuse to see you

               again.  Does she know you're here --

               Vicki?

                               BRUCE

(shrugging)

               No.

                               SELINA

               It must be strange.  Having all that

               power, and money -- never really knowing

               if that's what people are attracted to.

                               BRUCE

               What are you attracted to?

                               SELINA

               I think you're a little bit nuts.

(beat)

               I think you're a little -- bored with your

               life.  Having everything you want.  No

               variety, no...danger.  And every once in a

               while you need to take a risk.  Shake it

               all up.

                               BRUCE

               How?

                               SELINA

               Maybe by...coming here today.

     She leans back against a crate, moistens her lips.  She's

     letting him have it with both barrels.

                               SELINA (cont.)

               That's one thing I can give you, Bruce --

               danger -- a little something you can't get

               at home.

     BRUCE hesitates -- but the lure is irresistible.  He moves

     forward slowly; SELINA's eyes close; their lips draw slowly

     closer...

     ...and he SNEEZES IN HER FACE.  She backs off in shock as he

     covers his face.  His eyes are watering and he's WHEEZING.

     She rushes over --

                               SELINA

               Are you okay?

                               BRUCE

               Is there a 

cat

 in here?

     Right on cue, SELINA's black cat HECATE lets out a loud MEOW

     -- and STRETCHES against BRUCE's pants leg.  He brushes the

     animal aside and it LEAPS into SELINA's arms.  BRUCE sniffles

     uncontrollably.

                               BRUCE (cont.)

               Get it away!

     She drops the cat, which scampers off.  BRUCE rubs his eyes.

                               SELINA

               Poor thing.  You're allergic!

                               BRUCE

               Yeah, cats...ever since I was a kid...

(snorting and weeping)

               Look, I'd better get some fresh air. 

               Maybe another time, okay...

     He heads for the door before SELINA can stop him.  He's gone,

     but she knows she's left a dent in his armor.  She smiles in

     bemusement as HECATE jumps into her arms and PURRS.

EXT. FLUEGELHEIM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY

     BRUCE stumbles out the museum feeling mildly discombobulated.

     He marches down the front steps past a NEWSSTAND -- where he

     stops to buy a copy of the afternoon GLOBE.

     He opens it to the PERSONAL ADS and finds what he's been

     waiting for:

TALL, DARK, AND HANDSOME -- Christmas is coming.

Why don't we trim the tree together?

     This puzzles him for a moment -- until he looks up the street.

     In the distance, at the very center of Gotham Square, WORKMEN

     are stringing lights around an enormous CHRISTMAS TREE, almost

     fifty feet tall.

     The LIGHTING CEREMONY is an annual event in Gotham.  BRUCE

     smiles slightly, tucks the paper under one arm and walks to

     his car.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - NIGHT

     SNOW falls on a huge CROWD gathered around the big tree.  The

     tree won't be lit for another twenty minutes or so, and so the

     ONLOOKERS are singing CHRISTMAS CAROLS from printed lyric

     sheets.

     A BAND is playing on a makeshift ORCHESTRA PLATFORM erected in

     front of the tree, leading the crowd in a spirited rendition

     of "God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen."  The Square is rocking with

     good will toward men.  When they get to the part about saving

     us all from Satan's power --

EXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     -- the CAMERA TILTS UPWARD to BATMAN, watching the action from

     his usual gargoyle's perch.  He's scanning the streets and the

     rooftops, waiting tor the CATWOMAN to make her move --

     whatever it is.

     He glances at the building directly across the square from

     him.  On the roof is a neon sign reading 

Gotham City Globe

 in

     ornate old-English letters -- and above that, a ROTATING METAL

     SCULPTURE of the world turning.  His eyes rove downward along

     the facade of the building...

EXT. GOTHAM GLOBE - THAT MOMENT

     At street level, an ARMORED CAR has pulled up in front of the

Globe

 offices.  THREE SECURITY GUARDS with rifles climb out of

     the ARMORED CAR, followed by a FOURTH -- who has an OBLONG BOX

     handcuffed to his wrist.  Of course, we can't see what's

     inside, but to those of us in the know the box looks just

     about the right size for a RAVEN STATUETTE.

     The GUARDS scan the street and enter the building without

     incident.  As they do, a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN crosses the

     frame; mounted on its side is an ADVERTISING PLACARD which

     reads:

BATMAN: HERO OR MENACE?

Read All About It in the GOTHAM GLOBE!

EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN

     He watches with some curiosity.  An armored car: is this some

     part of the CATWOMAN's scheme?  But no...the GUARDS are safely

     inside the building, and the CAR is leaving.  He settles back

     to wait.

INT. NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN - THAT MOMENT

     The innocuous-looking VAN rounds the corner of the 

Globe

     building.  FRICK is at the wheel, FRACK is riding shotgun, and

     the PENGUIN is between them, peering out eagerly through the

     windshield.

     They turn into the 

Globe

's BASEMENT GARAGE -- where dozens of

     similar vans are parked at the LOADING BAYS.  Just part of the

     fleet...

INT. PROVOST'S OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER

     The quartet of SECURITY GUARDS arrive at PROVOST's office.

     The publisher has already packed his suitcases for a speedy

     getaway.  The LEAD GUARD -- the one cuffed to the RAVEN BOX --

     sets his precious cargo on a desk and stands discreetly at

     arm's length while PROVOST unlocks it and checks its contents.

     Satisfied, he slams it shut.  He reaches into his top drawer

     for an ENVELOPE, which he hands to his PERSONAL SECRETARY.

                               PROVOST

               Open this in an hour.  Phone my wife and

               tell her where to meet me.

(to the GUARDS; edgily)

               No trouble on the way, I take it?

                               LEAD GUARD

               No sir, Mr. Provost.  We came straight

               from the bank vault.

                               GUARD II

               'Copter should be just touching down.

               We'll have you safely out of here in no

               time.

EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN

     "Here Comes Santa Claus" echoes up from the streets.  BATMAN

     watches as a COPTER descends toward the HELIPAD on the roof of

     the 

Globe

...

INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER

     PROVOST and the LEAD GUARD with the raven box are at an

     elevator bank.  The other GUARDS head for a stairwell.

                               GUARD II

               We'll check the stairs.  See you on the

               roof.

     The LEAD GUARD starts to press the UP button, but PROVOST

     pulls a key from his pocket instead:

                               PROVOST

               No -- my private elevator.  It's safer.

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT

     shooting DOWN on the car as it rises.  The shaft above it is

     filled with BIRDS -- starlings, crows, pigeons and the like,

     swooping and gliding among the gears and cables...

EXT. ROOF OF GLOBE BUILDING - THAT MOMENT

     In BG, the helicopter on its pad, idling noisily, the rotors

     still spinning.  In FG, the small dormer-like structure that

     houses the STAIRWAY.  The metal access door opens, and the

     first of the GUARDS steps warily out, rifle at the ready.  He

     smiles back at his pal.

                               GUARD

               No way.  They don't pay us enough to

               tangle with Batm--

     A black-gloved, CHROME-TALONED HAND snakes around the edge of

     the dormer and RAKES ACROSS HIS THROAT...

INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT

     SWEAT beads up on PROVOST's lip as the GUARD hits the up

     button and the car begins to rise.  Suddenly, the LIGHTS GO

     OUT.  The car stops with a lurch.

                               PROVOST

               What is it??  What's happening??

     Suddenly, there in the darkness, they hear a series of loud

     POPPING SOUNDS...which 

could

 be gunfire...

EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - ON CROWD

     singing "Here Comes Santa Claus" at the top of their lungs.

     Happy faces beam.  No one hears anything unusual over the

     music...

EXT. ROOFTOP - ACROSS STREET - ON BATMAN

     BATMAN straining to listen.  We get another faint series of

     POPS -- barely audible over the CAROLING from below, and the

     loud PUTT-PUTT-PUTT of the helicopter blades.

     He can't really be sure he's heard anything at all.  He scans

     the roof of the 

Globe

 building, but he can't see what's

     happening beyond the big steel globe sculpture and the neon

     sign...

EXT. GLOBE BUILDING - ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT

     The CATWOMAN lets fly with another burst of automatic fire

     from the dead GUARD's rifle.  The helicopter is still idling,

     but no one's left to fly it -- the rooftop is littered with

     stiffs...

INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT

     PITCH BLACK.  Pre-verbal GROANS and MURMURINGS OF FEAR issue

     from the darkness.  An EERIE RED LIGHT kicks on -- the

     emergency generators -- and we see PROVOST backed up in a

     corner of the car, twitching and jumping like a crazed

     spastic.  The GUARD, in a futile effort to placate him, points

     up at the LIGHT:

                               GUARD

There

.  Mr. Provost.  

See

?  The

               generator's kicked in.  It's just an

               electrical problem.

     PROVOST is only marginally consoled.  They hear a strange

     TWITTERING NOISE in the shaft above them...

     PROVOST starts babbling again.  The GUARD slaps him across the

     face.  But the TWITTERING has him a bit concerned as well.  He

     stares up at the ceiling of the car as he PUNCHES BUTTONS on

     the panel; with another LURCH, the car begins to move.

                               GUARD

               There.  See?  It's moving.  We're 

fine

.

                               PROVOST

               It's going down.  

We're going DOWN

!!!

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT

     The BIRDS in the shaft have all ROOSTED on the TOP OF THE CAR.

     They're patiently riding it down as it descends...

INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT

     The car stops again.  PROVOST is totally losing it.  The

     exasperated GUARD grabs him and SHAKES HIM.

                               GUARD

               Okay, Mr. Provost -- I'm gonna have a look

               through the trap door.  But I need you to

               help me.  Okay?  You have to help.

     PROVOST nods and tries to get a grip on himself.  The GUARD

     looks up at the trap door in the ceiling of the car.  He can't

     reach it...

     He uncuffs the BOX containing PROVOST'S RAVEN from his wrist

     -- and STANDS on it.  Still short.  Unholstering his gun and

     using it as a prod, he can almost reach the trap door.  He

     JUMPS UP and, poking with the gun, manages to dislodge the

     panel slightly.

     More TWITTERING.  PROVOST and the guard look up through the

     tiny crack in the ceiling and see nothing but darkness.

                               GUARD

               Probably just some bird that's gotten in

               the shaft.  Now calm down.  You'll have to

               give me a boost.

     The GUARD climbs back atop the raven box.  PROVOST gives him a

     boost and he manages to catch hold of the lip of the trap

     door.

                               GUARD (cont.)

               Okay, help me out...steady...

     PROVOST wraps both arms around the GUARD's wriggling LEGS and

     tries to hoist him upward.

INT. SHAFT - ON ROOF OF CAR - THAT MOMENT

     From a vantage level with the roof of the car, we see the

     GUARD'S FINGERS, clinging to the lip of the trap door.  Now

     his HEAD rises into view, pushing the panel aside as he pulls

     himself upward.

     He peers around.  His BROW wrinkles as he sees a bizarre sight

     -- PASSELS of SQUAWKING BIRDS, walking back and forth in front

     of him, STRUTTING and PREENING mere inches from his face...

INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT

     The bottom half of the GUARD dangles from the ceiling.

     PROVOST still has his arms wrapped around the GUARD's knees.

     All at once, the GUARD begins to SCREAM -- his body JERKS and

     his legs KICK WILDLY.  Still PROVOST struggles to hang on --

     even as BLOOD spatters across the top of his bald dome...

     Finally, the GUARD's violent spasms are too much.  PROVOST

     trips over the raven box, stumbles backward and lands on his

     ass in a corner of the car.  The GUARD tumbles in a heap to

     the elevator floor, his face PECKED and CLAWED beyond

     recognition, his eyes gone altogether.

     PROVOST lets out a series of SHRIEKS.  He peers at the open

     trap door, sees the BIRDS staring curiously down at him, and

     SHRIEKS AGAIN.

     The EMERGENCY TELEPHONE rings.  He stares at it.  It rings

     again.  Shielding his eyes and screwing up his courage,

     PROVOST crawls across the floor and reaches for the receiver.

                               PENGUIN (V.O.; filter)

               Sixteenth floor.  Linens, housewares,

               ladies' lingerie!

                               PROVOST

W-who is this

??

INT. GLOBE - BASEMENT LOADING BAY - THAT MOMENT

     NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VANS are parked in neat rows -- all

     driverless.  FRICK is sitting with a boxful of electrical

     equipment next to a bank of ELEVATORS; all the cars have been

     LOCKED OPEN here in the basement, except for ONE -- PROVOST's

     private elevator, the doors to which are still closed.  The

     PENGUIN stands beside it, speaking into a RED PHONE.

                               PENGUIN

               Mr. Provost?  If you want to get out of

               that car alive, I suggest you follow my

               instructions to the letter.

     As he talks, we see various NEWSPAPER EMPLOYEES sprawled on

     the concrete nearby, DEAD.  A CORRUGATED METAL DOOR has been

     lowered over the LOADING BAY, separating the newspaper

     production staff from the VAN POOL.  They're trapped on the

     other side.  BANGING AWAY LOUDLY on the door...

                               PENGUIN (cont.)

               SHUT UP IN THERE.

(calmly; into phone)

               You should see a cord hanging just behind

               you.

INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT

     PROVOST looks over his shoulder and sees the aforementioned

     CORD descending through the trap door.

                               PROVOST

               Yes -- yes, I see it --

                               PENGUIN (V.O; filter)

               Tie the cord to the handle of your box.

     PROVOST lets the phone drop.  He grits his teeth, but hastens

     to obey.  As he's knotting the cord around the handle of the

     box, a DINKY BIRD flutters down through the trap and sends him

     into a panic.  Practically weeping, he reaches for the phone.

                               PENGUIN (V.O.; filter)

               When you're done, I want you to give two

               sharp yanks on the cord.

     Cowering in terror, PROVOST reaches for the cord and yanks it

     twice.

                               PROVOST

               Who are you??  Why are you 

doing

 this??

INT. LOADING BAY - ON PENGUIN

     Behind him, FRICK and FRACK are pulling on RED BERETS and

     BATMAN SWEATSHIRTS -- Order of the Bat gear.  FRICK climbs

     into a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN and starts the engine.

                               PENGUIN

               Well, Mr. Provost, I guess you could call

               me an irate reader.  And to be perfectly

               frank -- I'm doing this because I hate

               Garfield.

     Chuckling, the PENGUIN holds a SONIC DEVICE up to the

     mouthpiece of the phone.

INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT

     A SHRILL WHINE emanates from the receiver.  All at once, the

     elevator car is FULL OF BIRDS -- squawking wildly, flinging

     themselves against the wall, going insane in the tiny confined

     space.

     PROVOST is screaming like a madman.  The birds are in his

     hair, his face -- everywhere.  He fights his way over to the

     panel and begins punching buttons in a frenzy...

     All at once the car PLUNGES DOWNWARD.  It's as if the floor

     has DROPS AWAY beneath PROVOST's feet -- he's in FREE-FALL.

INT. LOADING BAY - ON PENGUIN

                               PENGUIN

               Going down!

     He hangs up the phone and steps a discreet distance back from

     the ELEVATOR DOORS.

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT

     The RAVEN BOX dangles from its cord in FG as the CAR rockets

     uncontrollably downward.  A steady stream ot BIRDS are making

     a quick exit from the trap door in the roof...

INT. TOP-FLOOR LANDING - THAT MOMENT

     The CATWOMAN's on a landing near the stairwell, just below the

     dormer that leads to the roof.  She pries open a pair of

     ELEVATOR DOORS...

     ...and a FLOCK of BIRDS pours out of the empty shaft, making

     for the open ACCESS DOOR a half-story above.  She reaches

     inside, finds the cord attached to the RAVEN BOX, and reels it

     in.

     She rips off the lock and opens the box for a quick look at

     her trophy.  It's there, all right -- another RAVEN just like

     the first two.  An awful CRASH, from twenty-five stories down,

     RATTLES THE SHAFT...

     She makes a disgusted face, grabs the RAVEN, and bolts for the

     roof.

EXT. ROOFTOP ACROSS STREET - ON BATMAN

     He watches in puzzlement as a VAST FLOCK OF BIRDS takes flight

     from the 

Globe

 roof across the square.  Something weird is

     definitely going on.  He's about to abandon his post --

     -- but down below, the CAROLERS have stopped CAROLING.  The

     big tree's about to be lit, and they're counting off the

     seconds:

                               CROWD

               Ten!  Nine!...

EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - CORNER NEWSTAND

     A ramshackle kiosk at street level.  The NEWS VENDOR has

     stepped out onto the sidewalk to watch the tree festivities.

     A GLOBE DELIVERY VAN, its side bearing the "BATMAN -- HERO OR

     MENACE?" advertisement, cruises past and dumps a bundle of

     papers on the curb.

EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON CROWD AT TREE

     EXCITEMENT is BUILDING as the seconds tick off:

                               CROWD

               ...Three!  Two!  One!

     The CHRISTMAS LIGHTS come on, and the CROWD breaks into

     CHEERS.  The ORCHESTRA strikes up a sprightly version of

     "JINGLE BELLS."

EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON NEWSTAND

     The NEWS VENDOR is applauding and singing along like everyone

     else when a 

second

 newspaper van rumbles past...

                               NEWS VENDOR

               Hey!  No!  I aleady got a --

     He spots TWO MASKED MEN in the doorway of the van -- wearing

     RED BERETS and BAT-SHIRTS.  They shove a BODY out the door --

     The mutilated corpse of HARRISON PROVOST lands on the sidewalk

     with a THUD -- right beside a bundle of NEWSPAPERS which read

     "BATMAN MURDER SPREE BAFFLES POLICE."

EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON VAN - MOVING

     The NEWS VENDOR chases after the VAN, but it's already rounded

     a corner and is cruising along the periphery of Gotham Square.

     The CROWD is still singing merrily, unaware of its presence --

     -- until the BACK DOORS fly open -- and a swarm of RABID,

     CHITTERING BATS screech out into the midst of the crowd!!

EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON CROWD AT TREE

     The CAROLERS break into MASS HYSTERIA as HIDEOUS BATS swoop

     down from above, CLAWING at their heads and shoulders.

     ORCHESTRA MEMBERS drop their instruments and stagger off the

     BAND PLATFORM, falling into the branches of the giant

     Christmas tree.

EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON SIDEWALKS

     CHRISTMAS SHOPPERS are teeming in and out of nearby STORES.

     They drop their SHOPPING BAGS and race about in utter CHAOS as

     the bats attack.  WOMEN SCREAM.  CHILDREN SCREAM.  MEN SCREAM

     TOO.

     A MAN staggers backward through a GLASS STOREFRONT and lands

     on his butt in a WINDOW DISPLAY -- a big mechanical SANTA

     CLAUS on his North-Pole throne, chuckling merrily in a

     prerecorded voice: "HO HO HO."  The MAN STRUGGLES WILDLY as

     the BATS converge on him.

INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - THAT MOMENT

     HORRIFIED SHOPPERS scatter through the aisles as the BATS pour

     in through the broken window.  WOMEN lined up for a FREE

     MAKEOVER squeal in panic as BATS arrive to rearrange their

     hairdos.

EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN

     He stares down stunned at the PANDEMONIUM raging below.  He

     glances across the street...and sees the TINY SILHOUETTE of a

     WOMAN standing atop the cast-iron GLOBE SCULPTURE, LAUGHING at

     the chaos, TAUNTING him.

EXT. STREETS - OVERHEAD ANGLE - THAT MOMENT

     A few blocks away from Gotham Square.  SIRENS HOWL.  There's a

     steady stream of COP CARS speeding toward the site of the

     disturbance.  One vehicle is moving in the opposite direction,

     against traffic -- a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN.

EXT. GLOBE BUILDING - ROOFTOP - A MOMENT LATER

     BATMAN touches down on the roof and stares in horror at the

     CORPSES strewn across the helipad.  A dying GUARD raises a

     shaky hand...

     BATMAN crouches beside him.  A GURGLE comes up from his throat

     and a bubble of BLOOD swells on his lips.  All at once he

     hears a WOMAN'S VOICE from the shadows of the GLOBE

     SCULPTURE...

                               CATWOMAN (O.S.)

               Some people just can't take discipline.

(beat)

               Go ahead.  Finish 'em off...

     His head jerks up.  He can't see anything.  A sudden WHOOSHING

     noise, and now the voice is coming from the other side of the

     roof.

                               CATWOMAN (O.S.)

               You might as well.  You're going to get

               blamed for it anyway.

     He stands.  He gets a quick glimpse of a FELINE SHADOW

     springing past a skylight; she's jumping all around the roof,

     clinging to exposed pipes and fixtures.  He reaches for a

     Batarang.

                               CATWOMAN (O.S.)

               Oh, come on, angel.  You know you want to.

(purring loudly)

               Besides -- I want to see how you do it!

                               BATMAN

               Who are you?

     He's barely gotten it out when she SLAMS INTO HIM from behind,

     feet first, knocking him to the rooftop.  He tries to get up,

     but she comes at him with a couple of CARTWHEELING KICKS,

     knocking him back into a cornice.  He ducks right just as a

     SHARP SPIKED HEEL strikes the exposed brick a mere three

     inches from his throat.

     He catches her leg, upends her -- but she somersaults away and

     lands on her feet.  Cats always do...

                               CATWOMAN

               My, aren't we frisky tonight.

     He flings the BATARANG.  It CLANGS into the big NEON SIGN as

     she SPRINGS up into the darkness, out of reach.  GLASS TUBING

     shatters and SPARKS FLY as she calls down from the shadows --

                               CATWOMAN

               I should tell you -- I've got nine lives

               to play with -- and you've only got one...

     He turns -- she drops DIRECTLY ONTO HIM -- and locked in a

     death grip, they STAGGER BACKWARDS across the roof, directly

     toward the HELICOPTER.  The huge ROTOR BLADES are still

     turning...

     BATMAN ducks instinctively and the CATWOMAN breaks free --

     FALLING BACKWARD onto the roof.  It's a strategic move: when

     he rushes at her, she BRACES HERSELF against the ground and

     KICKS UPWARD with startling force.

     This time the spiked heel connects -- LIFTING BATMAN off his

     feet, KNOCKING HIM BACKWARD into the TAIL of the HELICOPTER.

     He slumps there, stunned -- and before he knows it, she's on

     him.

     She grabs his THROAT with one hand and clamps the other around

     his CROTCH.  He tries to break her grip, but 

she's just as

strong as he is

.  And she's LIFTING him -- forcing him upward,

     toward the REAR STABILIZING ROTOR on the tail of the

     helicopter!

     The rear ROTOR BLADES WHINE LIKE A BUZZSAW as his head rises

     perilously closer.  At the last possible instant, he grabs a

     handful of her HAIR -- YANKS IT as hard as he can --

     With a YOWL, she releases him.  They tumble to the roof and

     she DIVES ATOP HIM.  Her TALONS click into place -- he sees

     them poised directly above his EYES --

     -- but manages to slam an ELBOW under her chin before she can

     strike.  Now they're disentangled; they get up groggily and

     circle each other...

     SOMEONE IS BANGING on the metal door that leads up to the

     roof, trying to break it down.  BATMAN turns for an instant --

     a sudden CRACK --

     -- and he finds himself all wrapped up in the CATWOMAN's CAT-

     O'-NINE-TAILS...which is also outfitted with a TASER.  She

     sends a PARALYZING ELECTRIC CHARGE through his body and he

     collapses to the roof in a jittering heap.  The BANGING on the

     door is louder...

                               CATWOMAN

               Did I tell you I invited company?  -- Keep

               'em busy, angel, I've gotta scat.

     She kneels down and plants a BIG WET KISS on his twitching

     face.  Then she scurries to the edge of the roof,

     DISAPPEARING --

     -- just as the DOOR gives way -- and an ARMED SWAT TEAM comes

     crashing out onto the roof!

     Just coming around, BATMAN tries to roll out of sight -- but

     the COPS are swarming the place.  They spot the BODIES on the

     tar and gravel, see BATMAN scuttling for cover, and draw the

     obvious conclusion.  Pulling guns, they OPEN FIRE.  BULLETS

     RICOCHET off the big metal GLOBE.

     BATMAN, as is customary in these situations, shoots a

     GRAPPLING HOOK at the roof of the next building over -- which

     is a couple of stories taller than the 

Globe

 -- and REELS

     HIMSELF UPWARD along the side wall.  The SWAT COPS score a

     couple of dead hits which set him swinging like a pendulum,

     but his body armor holds and he clings to the line long enough

     to reach the roof.

CUT TO:

INT. NEWSPAPER VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     FRlCK and FRACK, still in their Order-of-the-Bat garb, are in

     the front seats; the PENGUIN is leaning out the side door.

     Someone's obviously tipped the COPS about the source of all

     the ruckus --

     -- because a pair of POLICE CARS are on their tail and gaining

     fast.  Still hanging in the doorway, the PENGUIN raises his

     UMBRELLA, peers down its length like a RIFLE SIGHT, and PULLS

     A TRIGGER.

ANGLE ON SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

     A SONIC DART -- one of the PENGUIN'S BIRD MAGNETS -- lodges

     itself in the GRILLE of the foremost POLICE CAR.

INT. SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

     The COPS in the car react in astonishment as PIGEONS begin

     HURLING THEMSELVES at the WINDSHIELDS.  A DOZEN KAMIKAZE BIRDS

     bounce off in rapid succession.  CRACKS begin to spread across

     the glass.

     The COPS can't see where they're driving.  The car SWERVES

     WILDLY.  And still the PIGEONS KEEP COMING -- COVERING THE

     WINDSHIELD -- TOTALLY OBSCURING THE STREETS FROM VIEW...

EXT. STREETS - ON SQUAD CARS - THAT MOMENT

     The first car, COMPLETELY COVERED WITH BIRDS, smacks into a

     LAMPPOST and SKIDS.  The second car CRASHES INTO IT.  And the

     pigeons continue to pour down from the heavens, SWARMING onto

     the immobilized squad cars.

INT. NEWSPAPER VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

     The PENGUIN grins with delight as the van speeds off

     unmolested.

                               PENGUIN

               Look at that, boys -- they 

do

 flock

               together!!

CUT TO:

EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     AMBULANCES are pouring into the square as the BAT ATTACK

     continues.  COPS are firing their guns blindly into the skies

     as they try to evacuate the citizenry.  PARAMEDICS drop the

     stretcher they're carrying when BATS swoop down at their

     heads...

EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT

     BATMAN is still pursuing the CATWOMAN, who's perched one roof

     over, in a squat, wiggling a finger for him to follow.  The

     roofs are icy and treacherous, but he matches her step for

     step, leap for leap, as she vaults from one building to the

     next, leading him on.  Finally she reaches the edge of a

     building on the corner of the block; there's no place to go

     but down.  She squats on the ledge and smiles, beckoning to

     him --

                               CATWOMAN

               Ooh.  Where have you 

been

 all my life?

     He edges closer.  Suddenly, she does a BACKFLIP -- DIRECTLY

     OFF THE EDGE OF THE ROOF.

     BATMAN hears GLASS SHATTERING.  He hesitates a second -- moves

     closer to the edge of the roof -- PEERS OVER THE ICY CORNICE.

BATMAN'S POV - THAT MOMENT

     Staring down, he sees a narrow LEDGE running around the facade

     of the building some ten or twelve feet below.  The window of

     a corner apartment has been smashed; the curtains are flapping

     in the chill wind.

EXT. ROOF - ON BATMAN - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     She's obviously making her getaway through the apartment.

     BATMAN climbs up on the slippery cornice and prepares to drop

     to the ledge below -- cautiously, because it's a long way

     down.  A sudden CRACK --

     The CATWOMAN 

hasn't

 entered the apartment.  Instead, she's

     followed the ledge around the corner of the building, silently

     doubling back onto the roof behind BATMAN.  He TURNS just as

     her WHIP wraps itself around his left leg.  She gives it a

     sharp tug -- his feet SKID on the ice -- and HE TOPPLES OVER

     THE EDGE OF THE ROOF.

EXT. FACADE OF BUILDING - ON BATMAN

     He plunges downward for the briefest of seconds -- then JERKS

     UP SHORT, SLAMMING INTO THE WALL OF THE BUILDING.  The WHIP

     has coiled itself around his leg, and for now it's holding

     tight.  He's dangling upside down, bat-like; he bounces away

     from the wall; he SPINS in midair as one loop of the whip

     UNRAVELS, dropping him another foot or so.

     He manages to brace his left foot against the wall.  It's a

     massive strain, but he's momentarily safe if he can keep from

     moving.  The alternative is a twelve-story drop, straight down

     to the pavement...

EXT. ROOF - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT

     She's wrapped the handle-end of the whip around an exposed

     pipe on the roof, anchoring BATMAN in place.  With a cheshire-

     cat grin, she removes the RAVEN from her knapsack and holds it

     on the edge of the cornice.

EXT. FACADE - THAT MOMENT

     BATMAN hanging immobile.  Craning his neck, he can just see

     the

     RAVEN STATUETTE on the ledge above him -- bouncing slightly,

     and apparently 

talking

 to him...

                               CATWOMAN (O.S.)

               Nevermore.  Nevermore!

     Now the CATWOMAN appears beside it -- elbows on the cornice,

     chin propped up on her folded hands, like a chatty girl at a

     fern bar.

                               CATWOMAN

               Cute, huh!  I think it'll look nice over

               the fireplace.  Maybe you can drop by and

               see it sometime.

(demurely)

               I hope you won't think I'm too...

               aggressive or anything, but I find you

very

 attractive.

     She toys aimlessly with the whipcord, batting at it like a cat

     with a piece of yarn.  BATMAN grimaces.  She speaks in a low,

     soothing, seductive tone -- almost a purr.  Behind the bondage

     mask she bats her eyelashes.

                               CATWOMAN (cont.)

               It's just so hard to meet interesting men

               these days.  Don't you think so?

(sighing)

               I have trouble with relationships.  Men

               find me intimidating...kind of 

predatory

,

               you know?  Really I'm not.  Really I'm

               just playful...

     BATMAN huffs and puffs, trying to bend at the waist so he can

     grab hold of the whip.  She frowns and YANKS on it.  His foot

     flies free of the wall, and another loop of the whip uncoils

     before he can stabilize himself.

                               CATWOMAN (cont.)

               Don't laugh!  I'm trying to open up to

               you!

     Angrily, she holds a STEEL CLAW to the whip -- ready to cut

     him loose.

ANGLE ON BATMAN

     He's palmed the GRAPPLING-HOOK LAUNCHER from his belt.

     Holding it close to his body, out of view, he works it around

     into firing position.  He'll shoot it right through her if he

     has to...

                               CATWOMAN (cont.)

               I always seem to fall for the wrong guys.

               You know...most men are 

rats

.

ANGLE ON CATWOMAN

     She withdraws her hand from the whip, reverts to her

     philosphical mode.

                               CATWOMAN

Mice

, really.  It's disgusting -- they beg

               you to walk all over them and then they

               whine when you do it.  Once you've had

               your fun there's not much you can do but

               kill them.

(beat)

               But you seem different.  I mean, you

               obviously understand about dressing up...

that

 saves a lot of explaining.  I think

               people should indulge their fantasies,

               don't you?

     BATMAN is sweating profusely.  He can't hold his position much

     longer.  And the CATWOMAN is dragging this insane flirtation

     out endlessly...

                               CATWOMAN

               So I think I'll let you live.  Cute boys

               like you are hard to find...

(standing up)

               'Bye, angel.  I'll be thinking about you.

     And just like that, she VANISHES -- moving silently off with

     her raven, leaving BATMAN to dangle.  He hangs there a moment,

     tries to twist himself around without moving his foot.  He

     braces one hand against the wall; with the other, he lifts his

     grappling gun and FIRES.

     The HOOK SNAGS somewhere on the roof.  BATMAN yanks the line

     taut and is laboriously trying to pull himself erect when --

     -- the CATWOMAN reappears over the edge of the cornice!

                               CATWOMAN

               Gee...I'm 

so fickle

.

     A QUICK SWIPE of her STEEL TALONS, and the whipcord is neatly

     SEVERED.  BATMAN'S FOOT slips out from under him -- but he's

     still got hold of the GRAPPLING GUN.  He DROPS eight or ten

     feet...

EXT. ROOF - ON CATWOMAN

     watching with amusement as BATMAN's weight causes the hook to

     DISLODGE.  It skitters across the gravel surface of the roof

     and CATCHES, at the last instant, on the edge of the

     CORNICE --

     -- which promptly CRUMBLES and GIVES WAY.  Fascinated, the

     CATWOMAN leans over the edge of the roof and peers down...

ANGLE ON BATMAN - AS HE FALLS

     He flails wildly, tangled in his cape, as the ground rushes up

     toward him.  He gets a last-ditch inspiration -- finds the GAS

     CYLINDER on his belt and hits the switch.  The rods in his

     cape begin to INFLATE...

     Six stories up, his BATWINGS spring erect, slowing his plunge.

     Five stories up, an UPDRAFT hits him and he suddenly INVERTS.

     Four stories up, he rights himself.  Three stories up, he goes

     into a downward spiral, out of control, gliding in great wide

     arcs over the street...

     ...and a moment later there are no stories left.  With an ugly

     crunch, he smacks into the slush-covered pavement and BOUNCES.

     Face down, he skids some twenty feet to a halt -- right in the

     middle of a BUSY INTERSECTION.

EXT. INTERSECTION - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     A DELIVERY TRUCK hits the brakes and screeches to a stop, two

     feet away from BATMAN'S HEAD.  He doesn't move.  PEDESTRIANS

     are already gawking and pointing as the DRIVER climbs out and

     peers down at the inert caped figure lying face-down in the

     street:

                               DRIVER

               What the hell is 

this

?

     CARS are backed up, due to the panic in Gotham Square a few

     blocks over.  HORNS are honking.  A TRAFFIC COP marches

     over --

                               TRAFFIC COP

               Awright, what's the problem here?

(spotting BATMAN)

               Jesus.

     He tries to clear the crowd away.  A full-fledged GRIDLOCK is

     forming around the prostrate BATMAN.  The COP blows his

     whistle, tries to maintain order as two unifonned PATROLMEN

     rush up to join him.

     They manage to roll the unconscious BATMAN over on his back.

     The assembled COPS stare down at the mask, the scuffed body

     armor.  Still waxy, they finger the GUNS in their holsters...

                               PATROLMAN

               Good God.  Cowan -- get to the car --

               radio the commissioner!!

     By now there must be two hundred people in the intersection,

     all surging forward to get a look.  More COPS are arriving to

     beat them back.

                               TRAFFIC COP

               Is he dead?  What do we 

do

?

                               PATROLMAN

               The mask.  Get the mask off.

     They hunker down over BATMAN.  One of them tugs at his mask --

     but the helmet-like cowl doesn't want to give way.  He feels

     around --

                               TRAFFIC COP

               Some kinda seam here on the neck...

     The PATROLMAN nods okay, and the COP tugs at a Velcro-like

     fastening under BATMAN's chin.  The instant it comes open --

     -- a BURST of FINE GREEN MIST spews forth from concealed JETS

     in the gold-and-black BAT-EMBLEM, and the COPS reel backward,

     shrieking, gasping for breath and clewing at their eyes.

     Booby-trap -- they've just been 

Maced

.

     One of the ONLOOKING COPS steps back in horror and confusion.

     On impulse, he draws his gun and FIRES TWICE at BATMAN.  The

     body JERKS and the bullets RICOCHET OFF --

                               TRAFFIC COP

               DON'T SHOOT, you idiot.  The 

crowd

 --

     Before he can finish, a BLACK BOOT kicks the gun out of the

     ONLOOKING COP's hand.  BATMAN is back among the living.

     SIRENS BLARE as he spins and rolls into a crouch -- lashing

     out with elbows and knees -- driving the cops back --

     Fuck the crowd.  TWO MORE COPS pull their guns and open fire

     in absolute panic.  BATMAN slams backward into the delivery

     truck and crumples to the ground.  As he falls, he grabs a

     couple of SMOKE CAPSULES from his belt and flings them to the

     pavement.

     Seconds later, a THICK CLOUD OF BLACK SMOKE is spreading

     through the intersection.  BATMAN emerges into the midst of

     the crowd -- weaving in and out among the stalled vehicles --

EXT. INTERSECTION - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT

     A MOUNTED COP rides up to the outer fringe of the traffic jam,

     drawn by all the confusion.  He rears the horse back, turns it

     in a circle; blows his piercing whistle as he tries to reroute

     the incoming cars...

     Suddenly a WIRE wraps itself around his chest and arms.  He

     looks down.  He sees a BATARANG in the instant before a sudden

     JERK pulls him cleanly off his mount.

     BATMAN climbs up on the hood of the nearest car -- vaults over

     to the next -- and the next -- then hops into the saddle of

     the MOUNTED COP's waiting HORSE.  He digs in his heels,

     maneuvering through traffic...

EXT. POLICE CAR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     LT. EDDIE BULLOCK and another plainclothesman are a few blocks

     off trying to get through the jam.  Their siren is on, but the

     cars blocking their path have no room to pull over.  BULLOCK

     grabs the radio mike:

                               BULLOCK

               Hell of a mess up here, Commissioner.

               We'll have to go in on foot...

     As they wait for a response, they see a HORSE charging past in

     the opposite direction.  On the back of the horse...is BATMAN.

     Gaping, BULLOCK nudges his partner -- who throws the car

     immediately into REVERSE.  As they watch, BATMAN kicks the

     horse's flanks and turns right -- toward Gotham Park.

INT. GOTHAM PARK - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     Two RED BERETS, members of the Order of the Bat, are on night

     patrol, strolling down a rambling path near the entrance to

     the park.

                               RED BERET I

               This is wack, man.  Nothing ever happens

               around here anymore.

     The other RED BERET lets out a WHOOP OF FEAR and yanks his

     partner out of the way.  They tumble into a snowdrift as

     BATMAN'S HORSE vaults over the stone wall of the park and

     gallops past, nearly trampling them in the process.  By now,

     SQUAD CARS are roaring into the park...

INT. PARK - ANOTHER SECTION - A MOMENT LATER

     SIRENS BLARE and RED LIGHTS FLASH in the distance as the COP

     CARS spread out along the winding roads that run through the

     park.  BATMAN reins the horse in suddenly as a black-and-white

     whips past on an access road just ahead of him, no more than

     twenty yards away.

     He turns the horse in a circle.  MORE RED LIGHTS appear in the

     distance; another contingent of SQUAD CARS has just entered

     from the opposite side of the park.  It's going to be tough

     getting out of here...

     Then: his eyes fall on the statue of his great-grandfather,

     GENERAL WAYNE -- 

two

 Waynes on horseback, not twenty feet

     apart.  He thinks back to his earlier conversation with VICKI

     and gets an inspiration.

     He rides past General Wayne to the STONE BRIDGE which spans

     the little frozen creek.  There he finds the DRAINAGE TUNNEL

     VICKI described, obscured by the wire-mesh grate.  This must

     be where the boy vigilante holes up...

     He dismounts, ties his CAPE to the pommel of the horse's

     saddle and sends it off with a slap.  He pries the grate loose

     and crawls inside.

INT. DRAINAGE TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT

     A dank, but cozy, hideout; WARM STEAM hisses from a grate in

     the floor.

     RUMBLING SOUNDS fill the little chamber as a SUBWAY TRAIN

     passes directly underneath.  A little farther back there's an

     ACCESS SHAFT, with a Jacob's ladder, leading to the train

     tracks below.

     Poking around, he finds a couple of cardboard BOXES -- the boy

     vigilante's stash.  The first contains tins of food, plus

     various odds and ends.  The second's more in line with what he

     needs -- it's full of OLD CLOTHING.

     A TRAIN rumbles past underneath.  BRUCE removes his COWL and

     sets about putting together a civilian disguise that'll get

     him out of the park.  A wool hat and a long, moth-eaten

     topcoat: perfect.  As he's pulling them out of the box, he

     spies something extremely odd --

     It's a COSTUME -- a spangled red-and-green GYMNASTS OUTFIT

     with a little yellow CAPE -- neatly folded and in pristine

     condition.  He removes it carefully from the box and holds it

     up in front of him.  Stitched on the vest is a single initial,

     "R," in a black circle.  He stares at the whole mystifying

     ensemble in complete befuddlement...

     The roar of the train subsides, and he hears a SCUFFLING

     NOISE.  

Someone's in the tunnel with him

.  He lowers the

     costume abruptly --

     -- revealing DICK, the boy vigilante, who's crouched in front

     of him not three feet away.  The kid's just crawled up through

     the ACCESS SHAFT, and he's not at all happy to see an intruder

     messing with his stuff:

                               DICK

               It's MINE!

     He lunges furiously at BRUCE.  The two of them tumble back

     into the grate at the tunnel entrance, KNOCKING IT LOOSE --

EXT. PARK - MOUTH OF TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     A POLICE CAR streaks past on the bridge overhead mere seconds

     before BRUCE and DICK roll out into the snow, still grappling.

     BRUCE flings the kid into the bridge abutment.  DICK lands

     hard; when he looks up, his EYES WIDEN, and a weird crooked

     smile comes to his face...

     Out here in the moonlight he can 

see

 his opponent.  The body

     armor -- the gold-and-black emblem on the breastplate -- and

     above it all, the face of BRUCE WAYNE, exposed to view...

     As a siren howls nearby, BRUCE flattens himself against the

     bridge.  Like it or not, his fate rests entirely in a strange

     little boy's hands.

     The kid sizes up the situation immediately.  He nods his head

     up and down.  Then he takes off his 

own

 ratty coat and throws

     it to BRUCE.

     BRUCE is in no position to look a gift horse in the mouth.  He

     pulls on the coat, gives DICK a nod of acknowledgement, and

     starts to move off.

                               DICK

               NO.  WAIT!

     BRUCE turns, uncertainly.  DICK throws him his woolen SKI CAP.

     The KID GIGGLES -- oddly, uncontrollably.  Then he sprints off

     into the woods, dancing, leaping.  As he disappears from view,

     he lets out a shrill, piercing, almost FERAL SHRIEK --

     -- which is obviously intended to divert the cops.  BRUCE

     makes haste in the opposite direction.

EXT. PARK - ANOTHER SECTION - A MOMENT LATER

     BRUCE'S HORSE gallops through the trees, the black bat-cape

     still attached to its saddle and BILLOWING behind it.

INT. SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     TWO COPS scanning the park.  The CAPED HORSE charges past in

     front of them and is momentarily silhouetted in the

     headlights.  From a distance, it looks like BATMAN is still in

     the saddle.

     The COP at the wheel makes a sudden turn.  A moment later, he

     SLAMS ON THE BRAKES.

     A MAN has just stepped out onto the road, directly in the

     squad car's path -- a hunched figure in an old coat and woolen

     ski cap, obviously one of the homeless.  A COP leans on the

     horn and shouts out the window:

                               COP

               Dumb son of a bitch!!

     The MAN -- BRUCE -- steps back out of the squad car's path.

     The COPS take off -- in hot pursuit of a riderless horse.

CUT TO:

INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - PRE-DAWN

     A DOCTOR'S BAG rests on the kitchen table.  ALFRED, in robe

     and slippers, rummages inside it and comes up with an ACE

     BANDAGE.

                               ALFRED

               Commissioner Gordon called.  He wants to

               install a full contingent of police guards

               here at the manor -- in round-the-clock

               shifts -- to protect you from Batman.

     BRUCE is sitting erect in a straightbacked chair.  His shirt

     is open and he's holding his arms aloft while ALFRED wraps a

     full roll of adhesive tape around his battered RIBS.

                               BRUCE

               Great.  What'd you tell him?

                               ALFRED

               I told him that since you 

were

 Batman,

               you'd require no protection 

from

 Batman.

     BRUCE makes a face: how droll.  ALFRED tears off the tape with

     a brisk YANK -- and BRUCE lets out an involuntary YELP OF

     PAIN.

                               BRUCE

Jesus

, Alfred -- !!

                               ALFRED

               In future, sir...I strongly advise against

               trying to fly off twenty-story buildings.

                               BRUCE

               It's just a few bruises.

                               ALFRED

One

 bruise, sir.  Which covers your entire

               body.

     BRUCE gets up -- stiffly -- and buttons his shirt in gingerly

     fashion while ALFRED packs his first-aid gear in the doctor's

     bag.

                               BRUCE

               I'm getting too old for this line of work.

(beat)

               Cops placed me at the scene of the crime

               -- that weird kid of Vicki's saw my

               face --

                               ALFRED

               I shouldn't worry overmuch.  I doubt the

               two of you move in the same circles.

                               BRUCE

               -- and I got the living shit knocked out

               of me by a 

woman

.

                               ALFRED

               Sir -- such outmoded sexist attitudes are

               quite unbecoming.

INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - DAY

     In a lavishly-appointed guest room on Gotham's Upper East Side

     (or equivalent thereof), we find a pair of PLAINCLOTHES COPS

     settled in for a stakeout: rumpled topcoats thrown across

     antique chairs, french-fry bags and GREASY BURGER WRAPPINGS

     littering the carpet.  HIGH-POWERED RIFLES propped against one

     wall.

     They peer through venetian blinds at an ELEGANT OLD BROWNSTONE

     across the street...

HIS POV - ROOF OF BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT

     A UNIFORMED COP, also carrying a walkie-talkie, is keeping

     watch on the roof of the brownstone.  He signals "all clear"

     to his counterpart watching from the house opposite.

INT. UNMARKED CAR - THAT MOMENT

     TWO MORE PLAINCLOTHESMEN are parked at the end of the block,

     munching on donuts and watching the same brownstone.  They

     spot a POSTMAN lugging his sack up the tree-lined street on

     his way to the brownstone.  One of the PLAINCLOTHESMEN picks

     up his RADIO MIKE:

                               PLAINCLOTHESMAN

               Mailman's coming.

EXT. BROWNSTONE - A MINUTE LATER

     The POSTMAN marches up the front steps of the brownstone,

     sorting through letters and packages.  He hasn't even rung the

     bell when the door is opened by ANOTHER COP -- who snatches

     the mail delivery from his hands and SLAMS THE DOOR IN HIS

     FACE.

INT. BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT

     MORE COPS, at least half a dozen, are milling about inside --

     unshaven, ties loosened, shirtsleeves rolled up.  They're in

     for the long haul.

     The first COP gives a handful of letters to a couple of

     COLLEAGUES -- then hands over a PARCEL, wrapped in brown

     paper, to a pair of BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERTS.  They carry it

     gingerly into the kitchen.  Into the midst of all this

     bustling activity strides COMMISSIONER GORDON:

                               GORDON

               Anything suspicious!

     In the parlor, where all the shades are drawn, TWO COPS are

     examining each letter in turn, holding them up to a light

     bulb, CREASING THEM carefully before slitting them open.

                               COP

               Nothing yet.  Christmas cards and bills.

     He anxiously watches their progress.  A VOICE calls from the

     kitchen.

                               BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERT (V.O.)

               Commissioner -- ?

INT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER

     GORDON enters.  The bomb-disposal boys have their equipment

     scattered all over the kitchen table.  They've slit the brown-

     paper wrapping of the PACKAGE, exposing a ROUND DECORATIVE

     TIN.

                               BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERT

               It's a fruitcake.

     He lifts the lid for GORDON to have a look.

                               GORDON

               ...Have it analyzed.

INT. BROWNSTONE - ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT

     A bleary-eyed ELLIOTT TIPTREE marches down the stairs carrying

     a pair of OVERSIZED SUITCASES.  His WIFE and TWO KIDS are

     behind him -- all bundled up, preparing to embark on an

     extended vacation.

                               POLICEMAN

               Mrs. Tiptree?  The car's here.

     TIPTREE, fighting back tears, embraces his wife for a long

     wordless moment.  Their LITTLE GIRL, aged six, tugs at Mommy's

     sleeve.

                               LITTLE GIRL

               I don't wanna go to Grandma's.  I wanna

               stay here with Daddy.

                               MRS. TIPTREE

               She's got a nice tree just like ours,

               honey.  Daddy'll be up as soon as he can.

                               LITTLE GIRL

               She's old.  She doesn't even have cable.

                               LITTLE BOY

               What about our presents?

     He gestures toward the GIFTS piled high around the tree in the

     parlor.

                               TIPTREE

               Don't worry.  I'll bring 'em up with me.

               We'll open 'em when I get there.

     TIPTREE forces a smile for the kids.  He CLUTCHES his wife's

     hand.

                               GORDON

               Sorry, folks, but we'd better move along.

                               MRS. TIPTREE

               Kids?  Tell your Daddy goodbye...

     Tearful hugs all around; then a cadre of UNIFORMED COPS escort

     MRS. TIPTREE and the KIDS to the door.  TIPTREE pulls GORDON

     aside.

                               TIPTREE

               They'll be safe, won't they?

                               GORDON

               As safe as we can make 'em.

(beat; sternly)

               It would help if you could give us some

               small hint what this is all about.

                               TIPTREE

               I told you.  I...

     TIPTREE shrugs helplessly and stares at his shoes.  GORDON is

     convinced he's holding something back.

                               GORDON

               You have no idea what was in that box that

               Provost had delivered from the bank.

     TIPTREE shakes his head wearily.  GORDON glowers as he turns

     to go.

                               GORDON (cont.)

               All right, Mr. Tiptree.  Merry Christmas.

     GORDON exits.  TIPTREE wanders listlessly into the living

     room, pulls back the drapes, and WATCHES as his wife and kids

     ride off in a convoy of POLICE CARS.  One of the COPS tries to

     pull him away from the window, but he refuses to move...

     ...until a PHONE RINGS.  Everyone jumps at once.  A TECHNICIAN

     hits a switch on a loudspeaker-and-tape-recorder assembly,

     then gestures for TIPTREE to pick up the receiver...

                               TIPTREE

               Hello...?

                               VOICE ON LOUDSPEAKER

               Mr. Tiptree?  Andy here.  Listen -- we've

               got a chance to grab a good-sized block of

               Atlantic Teledyne at twenty-six and an

               eighth --

     The COPS heave sighs and turn off their tracing equipment.

                               TIPTREE

               Not today, Andy.  Let's talk after New

               Year's.

     TIPTREE hangs up and starts to BAWL right there in the middle

     of the room.  The COPS turn away in sympathetic embarrassment

     as he goes to a corner wet bar and pours himself a good stiff

     jolt.

INT. TIPTREE'S BEDROOM - DAY

     Wallowing in despair, TIPTREE sits at an antique secretary

     composing a LETTER.  He takes a long pull on a glass of

     Scotch, signs his name, and inserts the letter into an

     envelope.  He opens the desk drawer -- takes a long look at a

     .38 automatic stashed inside -- then finds a stamp and affixes

     it to the envelope.  He addresses it to BRUCE WAYNE.

     A moment later he hears a noise at the window: TINK TINK TINK.

     He peers through the blinds and sees a CARRIER PIGEON on the

     ledge outside -- pecking at the glass, asking to come in.

     He raises the window and the PIGEON hops fearlessly inside,

     onto the sill.  The bird, well-trained, struggles only

     slightly as he unties a tiny CAPSULE from its leg and removes

     a FOLDED NOTE.  Scrawled across it is a handwritten message:

IF POLICE SEE THIS YOUR FAMILY IS DEAD

     He opens the note and begins to read as the PIGEON takes wing.

CUT TO:

INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - DAY

     BRUCE is at his desk examining the morning editions.  A BANNER

     HEAD-LINE shrieks:

BATMAN SOUGHT IN PUBLISHER'S MURDER

Bat Attack Panics Gotham Square

J. Harrison Provost, 41, Leaves Distinguished Legacy

     He hears a VISITOR arriving in the entry hall.  He gets up...

INT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT - DAY

     BRUCE ambles out and sees SELINA, who's just arrived, doing

     her patetented thing on ALFRED.

                               SELINA

               English accents are 

so stimulating

.

(beat)

               You have the most beautiful silver hair!

     ALFRED stammers as she reaches up to STROKE HIS HAIR.  He's

     about to break into a sweat.  He's eminently relieved when she

     turns and sees --

                               SELINA (cont.)

               Bruce!

                               BRUCE

               Selina.  What are 

you

 doing here?

     ALFRED affects a look of grandmotherly outrage as SELINA

     slinks over and takes BRUCE by the arm.  She's on him like a

     barnacle.

                               SELINA

               I wanted to see your things, remember?

               And I got tired of waiting for you to call

               me back.

(gesturing toward ALFRED)

               He's adorable.  How long have you had him?

INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER - DAY

     BRUCE leads SELINA down a hallway to the armory.  He glances

     back over his shoulder and sees ALFRED peering snoopily around

     the corner.

                               BRUCE

               You heard about Harry Provost.

                               SELINA

               It's incredibly awful.  It got me a little

               worried.

(sidling up closer)

               I hate to think of something happening to

you

.

                               BRUCE

               Same here.

                               SELINA

               It's odd, though.  Danger, the thought of

               suddenly dying -- in a weird way it gets

               you sort of...aroused.  Don't you think?

     BRUCE cocks an eyebrow at her.  

Everything

 gets her sort of

     aroused.

INT. ARMORY - A MOMENT LATER

     SELINA BEAMS at the fantastic collection of armored gear and

     exotic weapons.  She's like a kid in a toy shop.

                               SELINA

               Bruce, this is 

incredible

.

(indicating a suit of armor)

               Malaysian -- ?

                               BRUCE

               Not bad.  Sarawak warrior caste.

                               SELINA

               It's like -- everything in here is another

               little piece of your mind.  I was right

               about you.

(turning to face him)

               Promise, okay?  Promise you'll show me

               every inch of this place.

     PAGE 87 MISSING FROM HARD COPY

INT. BATCAVE - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER

     ALFRED is at a PRINTER, scanning page after page of computer

     printout.  He delivers his findings to BRUCE, who's seated at

     a nearby terminal, scanning data and tapping away at the

     keyboard.

                               ALFRED

               The police have no files whatsoever on

               Selina Kyle.

                               BRUCE

(abstractedly)

               London...Cairo...Belgium...

                               ALFRED

               What exactly are you --

                               BRUCE

               Her credit card records.

(looking up)

               Every major art theft in the last five

               years -- she's been on the scene or close

               to it.

                               ALFRED

               You mean she's some sort of -- collector?

               A...cat burglar, or --

                               BRUCE

               Could be.  Museum curator, authenticator

               -- she's got the perfect cover for it.

(beat)

               What would she want with that stupid

               raven?

                               ALFRED

               Raven, sir?

                               BRUCE

               That's what the Catwoman took from

               Provost.  A little raven statuette, about

               so big...

(shaking his head)

               But it couldn't have been that valuable.

     He continues to scan the screen.  ALFRED is suddenly lost in

     thought.

                               ALFRED

               How very odd.

(long pause)

               I'm sure it's nothing, but --

                               BRUCE

               What, Alfred?

                               ALFRED

               Your father had a raven, sir.  A small

               statue of the very sort you describe.  It

               used to sit on his desk.

This

 piques BRUCE's interest.  He swivels around in his chair

     and stares directly up at ALFRED.

                               BRUCE

               What happened to it?

                               ALFRED

               After your father's...demise, Mr. Tiptree

               came to the house and asked if he could

               have it.  As a keepsake.  I saw no harm...

(shrugging)

               That was thirty years ago.

                               BRUCE

               Wait a minute.  Mr. Tiptree?

                               ALFRED

George

 Tiptree.  Your friend Elliott's

               father.

INT. TIPTREE'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

     TIPTREE has an oversized suitcase open on the bed.  It's empty

     -- except for the BALLED-UP WADS of NEWSPAPER which he's

     stuffing inside it.  His head turns suddenly at the sound of

     the doorbell...

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER

     TIPTREE emerges from his bedroom and peers over a bannister

     into the ENTRYWAY below.  Standing there is an unexpected

     visitor -- BRUCE WAYNE -- holding his arms aloft while a

     battery of COPS pat him down.

                               BRUCE

               What are you looking for -- Batarangs?

                               TIPTREE

               Bruce!  Come on up.

(to the COPS)

               I want to talk to Mr. Wayne alone.

     The COPS look on suspiciously as BRUCE ascends the stairs.

INT. TIPTREE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER

     TIPTREE lets BRUCE inside and shuts the door behind him.

     BRUCE hands him a GIFT BOX.

                               BRUCE

               I brought you a Christmas present.  Sorry

               about the wrapping -- the police made me

               open it.

     TIPTREE opens the box and pulls out a diamond-studded TIE

     CLASP.  He looks up at BRUCE with an odd mixture of

     bewilderment and gratitude.  BRUCE nods for him to try it on,

     and he obliges...

                               TIPTREE

               ...I'm afraid I don't have anything for

               you.

                               BRUCE

               I think you may have something that

               belonged to my father.

                               TIPTREE

               -- You know?

     He stares at BRUCE, astonished.  His head sinks into his

     hands.

                               TIPTREE (cont.)

               It'll all be over tomorrow.  One way or

               another, it'll all be over.

(looking up; despondent)

               I've decided, Bruce.  I'm gonna give him

               the last two ravens.  He's already got the

               others.

                               BRUCE

               What are you talking about?  

Who

?

                               TIPTREE

               Batman.  I don't know how he found out,

               but --

     TIPTREE reaches for the bottle on his desk to pour himself a

     drink, but BRUCE angrily knocks the glass out of his hands.

                               BRUCE

It's time you told me what's going on

here

.

                               TIPTREE

               Didn't you ever wonder where it came from,

               Bruce?  All the privilege, all the power

               ...all the 

money

?

(beat)

               The ravens are a...a kind of 

map

, Bruce.

               The key to an incredibly vast fortune.

                               BRUCE

               Whose fortune?

                               TIPTREE

               Gotham City's.

FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS)

     The cobblestone streets of 19th-Century Gotham.  A massive

     EXPLOSION blows open one wall of a municipal building, and

     total CHAOS erupts: fires starting, BYSTANDERS screaming,

     POLICE rushing to the scene...

                               TIPTREE

               In 1880 the Gotham City Treasury was

               looted.  It was a fantastic operation --

               perfect military precision.  The robbers

               made off with milllons in gold and silver

               bullion...

     A HORSE-DRAWN CART weighted down with gold bricks careens

     around a corner.  Atop it are two men in MASKS, firing a

     GATLING GUN into the crowd.  POLICE and ONLOOKERS tumble to

     the pavement, shot dead, as ANOTHER CART emerges from the

     wreckage of the treasury and takes off in the opposite

     direction.

FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS)

     CITY OFFICIALS in a boardroom trading papers back and forth,

     arguing furiously with five calm, distinguished-looking GENTS

     -- one of whom is the bushy-bearded Civil War hero GEN. OLIVER

     WAYNE.

                               TIPTREE (V.O.)

               The city was going under.  Bankrupt...

               until 

five rich men

 stepped in to bail it

               out.  In exchange they took the land

               rights, the mineral rights, the service

               contracts --

BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND TIPTREE

                               BRUCE

               The Five Families.

                               TIPTREE

               Our ancestors.  They 

bought

 Gotham City --

               carved it up and ran it into the ground.

               In five years they were rich beyond

               imagining.

(pause)

               We've just been following in their

               footsteps.  And in all this time no one's

               ever suspected --

                               BRUCE

               -- that they were the ones behind the

               robbery?

FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS)

     The FIVE PATRIARCHS in front of a roaring fireplace at Wayne

     Manor, raising a celebratory toast.  CAMERA PANS OVER to a

     nearby table; on it rest FIVE RAVEN STATUETTES.

                               TIPTREE (O.S.)

               They had five ravens made.  Five ravens

               which -- combined -- would reveal the

               location of the treasure they'd stolen.

(beat)

               But they never touched it.  They never

               needed to.  It's still there to this day.

BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND TIPTREE

                               TIPTREE

               The ravens, and the 

secret

 -- have been

               passed down through generations.  Father

               to son...

(shaking his head)

               Your father -- died before he could tell

               you.

                               BRUCE

               So they stole his piece of the puzzle.

                               TIPTREE

               Yeah.  I've got it, Bruce, and I'm going

               to hand it over.  He's right, you know.

               We've all been feeding -- feeding on the

               soul of Gotham...

     BRUCE stares at him, stony-faced.  There's one part of the

     story that doesn't quite add up.

                               BRUCE (cont.)

               I don't believe you, Elliott.  My father

               was a decent man -- an honorable man.  He

               would 

never

 have taken part in a scheme

               like this.

                               TIPTREE

               It wasn't his doing, Bruce.  It was --

                               BRUCE

That doesn't matter

.  If he knew that his

               fortune was based on a 

crime

 -- a crime

               against the city...

(violently)

               Reputation or not, he would've tried to --

                               TIPTREE

Christ

, Bruce!  Do you want me to 

spell it

out

 for you?!?

     BRUCE backs off.  An awful shiver of anticipation runs down

     his spine.

                               TIPTREE (cont.)

               He 

was

 a decent man.  He 

was

 an honorable

               man.  

That's why they had him killed

.

     CAMERA ZEROES IN ON BRUCE'S HORRIFIED FACE as we get a

SERIES OF SHOTS

     Quick, almost subliminal glimpses of BRUCE's primal trauma: a

     MUGGER snatching at his mother's necklace.  THOMAS WAYNE

     lunging at him.  The young JACK NAPIER firing at THOMAS.

     PEARLS showering down on the rain-drenched sidewalk.  A second

     bullet felling his MOTHER --

     -- and finally, young BRUCE himself, face wracked with PAIN

     and GRIEF --

BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE

     -- an expression which perfectly matches the one which the

     adult BRUCE is wearing as he relives it all thirty years

     later.  Staggered and glassy-eyed, he stares off into space as

     TIPTREE finishes his tale.

                               TIPTREE

               They killed him...to protect their secret

               ...and now the bill's come due.  Now the

               bill's come due.

CUT TO:

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - ESTABLISHING - TOWARD DUSK

     The wrought-iron gate outside BRUCE's vast estate -- and

     beyond it, Wayne Manor itself, rising bold and stately against

     the setting sun.  A COUNTY SHERIFF'S CAR cruises past...

INT. WAYNE MANOR - BRUCE'S BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

     BRUCE lies motionless on his bed.  Scattered about him are

     SCRAPBOOKS, FAMILY PHOTOS and yellowed NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS

     which describe the murder of his parents.  Disoriented, he

     gazes about aimlessly at his familiar surroundings -- which no

     longer seem quite so familiar...

     He folds his arms formally across his chest and stares up at

     the ceiling, inert, as if the very weight of his heritage is

     crushing him down.  Somewhere, a PHONE RINGS.  He makes no

     move to answer it.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - DUSK

     VICKI's at the kitchen table drinking coffee.  ALFRED, who's

     in his apron preparing dinner, picks up the ringing phone.

                               ALFRED

               Thank you, yes, everything's fine.  I'll

               expect your next call in an hour.

(hanging up; to VICKI)

               The police are becoming an awful nuisance.

                               VICKI

               I feel so awful for him, Alfred.  There

               must be something we can do.

                               ALFRED

               I realized long ago -- that there are

               places in Mr. Wayne's heart which no one

               will ever penetrate --  or share.

(pause)

               He loves you, Miss Vale.  But in certain

               ways he will always be alone.

                               BRUCE (O.S.)

               ...Thanks for the testimonial.

     ALFRED turns and sees BRUCE standing in the doorway, staring

     at him.  He starts to say something, but thinks better of it.

     He returns to his dinner preparations as BRUCE sits down

     across from VICKI.  She extends a hand and he takes it --

     making a visible effort to hold himself together.

                               BRUCE

               Tiptree's planning some kind of rendezvous

               with 'Batman.'  I think Batman ought to be

               there when it happens.

                               ALFRED

               I see, sir.  When shall we expect you

               back?

                               BRUCE

               Get your cap.  You're driving.

INT. TIPTREE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

     It's late, and the house is dark as TIPTREE treeds silently

     downstairs carrying an OVERSIZED SUITCASE.  The lights are on

     in the kitchen, where the COPS are playing poker and watching

     TV.

INT. PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     CHRISTMAS TREE LIGHTS twinkle in the darkness.  TIPTREE kneels

     beside the tree and digs around among the packages.  He pulls

     out an OBLONG GIFT BOX with a tag addressed "TO DADDY -- FROM

     SANTA."

     With a glance back at the kitchen, he soundlessly unwraps the

     package -- and opens it to reveal a matched set of RAVEN

     STATUETTES.  He transfers them to the big suitcase -- then

     slinks into the hallway...

INT. BEDROOM ACROSS STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The two STAKEOUT COPS are chuckling at a Charlie Brown

     Christmas special on a portable TV.  One of them glances out

     the window and sees a man in a topcoat emerging from the

     brownstone, SUITCASE in hand...

                               STAKEOUT COP I

               Shit -- that's Tiptree!!

     The COP grabs for his WALKIE-TALKIE.

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     TIPTREE is halfway down the block when two COPS burst out of

     the brownstone.

                               COP

               Mr. Tiptree!  What the hell are you --

     HEADLIGHTS FLASH ON as the SURVEILLANCE CAR revs its engine.

     TIPTREE breaks into a RUN -- and the COPS from the brownstone

     follow suit.  At the end of the block he vanishes down a

     SUBWAY ENTRANCE.

INT. SUBWAY STATION - THAT MOMENT

     A VIOLINIST is panhandling outside the token booth as the COPS

     come racing down the stairs.  The COPS trip over his open

     violin case, scattering small change across the conrete floor.

     They flash their badges at the booth and VAULT OVER THE

     TURNSTILE --

     -- just in time to see TIPTREE, with his SUITCASE, scuttling

     down a stairway which leads to the train platform below.

INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - A MOMENT LATER

     TIPTREE steps onto an EXPRESS TRAIN.  The doors slide shut

     behind him -- and the hapless COPS curse under their breath as

     he rolls off.

                               COP

               We've gotta get back to the radio.

INT. SUBWAY CAR - A MOMENT LATER - MOVING

     TIPTREE takes an open seat and looks around apprehensively.

     Being fabulously rich, be's probably ridden the subway twice

     in his life -- and at this time of night, EVERY FACE in the

     sparsely-populated car looks vaguely menacing.  Derelicts,

     prostitutes, teen-gang members -- ALL OF THEM eye this well-

     heeled stranger with intense curiosity as he clutches his

     suitcase and stares anxiously at the floor...

     An ODD, GAUNT FIGURE enters at the end of the car.  It's a

     DEAFMUTE.  He shambles down the aisle passing out little white

     CARDS.  One side is a guide to International Sign Language.

     The other reads:

DEAF AND DUMB

PLEASE HELP -- $1.00

     TWO YOUNG TOUGHS take a card and tear it in half, chuckling,

     shining the DEAFMUTE on.  A HOOKER, the heart-of-gold type,

     stuffs a buck in his tin cup.  He reaches TIPTREE and extends

     a card; TIPTREE ignores him, refusing to make eye contact --

     -- but the DEAFMUTE shoves the card insistently into his face.

     Now TIPTREE looks up.  THIS CARD bears a 

personalized

 message:

GOTHAM CENTRAL STATION

B-TRAIN WEST TO RIVERVIEW

     TIPTREE's eyes widen.  The DEAFMUTE -- who is in fact FRICK --

     glowers down and holds out his cup.  TIPTREE digs in his

     pocket; the smallest bill he's got is a twenty, but he hands

     it over anyway.

     Smiling at this act of generosity, FRICK moves on to the next

     car.  TIPTREE stares down tremulously at the card.  He fidgets

     with his TIE CLASP -- the one BRUCE gave him earlier...

INT. LIMO - MOVING - NIGHT

     TIGHT on a hand-held ELECTRONIC TRACING DEVICE.  A small BLIP

     moves across a shifting GRID not unlike a radar screen.

     BRUCE is in the back of the limo, eyeing the tracer intently.

     ALFRED's up front, at the wheel.

                               BRUCE

               According to this, he's directly 

below

 us.

                               ALFRED

               The subway, sir?

                               BRUCE

               Yeah.  Take a right.

INT. GOTHAM CENTRAL STATION - THAT MOMENT

     It's slightly more crowded here in the hub of Gotham.  TIPTREE

     emerges onto the platform and spies a squad of TRANSIT COPS

     thirty or forty feet away -- speaking into WALKIE-TALKIES as

     they scan the crowd.

     Sticking close to the tracks, he turns swiftly toward the

     nearest stairway -- blending in with the crowd, trying to hold

     the SUITCASE out of view.

INT. LOWER PLATFORM - A MINUTE LATER

     TIPTREE IS RUNNING for the B-train just as the doors begin to

     close.  He manages to thrust the suitcase inside -- but the

     doors SLIDE SHUT on his hand, and he DROPS IT.  He stands

     there on the platform, his face turning BONE WHITE as the

     train lurches forward...

     False alarm.  The train stops, and the doors hiss open again.

INT. SUBWAY CAR - MOVING - A MOMENT LATER

     TIPTREE clambers aboard with a severe case of palpitations.

     As the train pulls out, a couple of rough-looking but helpful

     STREET TYPES show him to a seat and hand him his precious

     suitcase.  He sits there panting...

     Moments later, a DEAFMUTE enters the car.  TIPTREE does a

     take: it's the exact same guy who was riding the other line!

     Of course, he doesn't know about Frick's malignant twin --

     FRACK...

WIPE TO:

INT. LOCAL STOP - TEN MINUTES LATER - NIGHT

     Having changed trains twice more since we left him, TIPTREE

     debarks at a deserted local stop.  The station is EMPTY except

     for one other passenger, who's gotten off here as well -- a

     WOMAN in a long fur coat.

     TIPTREE WATCHES as she approaches on her way to the stairwell,

     STILLETO HEELS clicking across the floor.  There's something

     familiar about her -- but she's wearing a big, broad-brimmed

     hat, and she TILTS IT DOWN as she passes, obscuring her face.

     It is, of course, SELINA...

     TIPTREE stands there expectantly with his suitcase, awaiting

     further instructions.  They aren't long in coming.  A BLACK

     MYNAH BIRD swoops out of the tunnel, lands on the platform,

     and STRUTS in front of him.

                               MYNAH

               FOLLOW ME.  AWWWKK!  FOLLOW ME.

     The bird flutters its wings and takes off again -- INTO THE

     TUNNEL.  TIPTREE stares after it in disbelief.  Then the bird

     CAWS AGAIN -- its shrill voice echoing from the darkness of

     the tunnel:

                               MYNAH (O.S.)

               FOLLOW ME.  AWWWKK!

     TIPTREE clambers over the edge of the platform, dropping

     awkwardly to the tracks below.  Suitcase in hand, he begins to

     walk...

INT. LIMO - MOVING - NIGHT

     ALFRED tearing up the streets as BRUCE consults his tracer.

                               BRUCE

               He's slowed down.  Looks like he's under

               the park.

                               ALFRED

               How do you propose to get down there, sir?

               We can't have Batman strolling up to buy a

               token.

                               BRUCE

               I know another way in.

(beat)

               Step on it.  They're down there waiting

               for him.

     ALFRED turns the limo hard right -- into GOTHAM PARK -- past

     the statue of GENERAL WAYNE atop his horse...

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT

     A LOCAL TRAIN roars by, filling the screen.  When it passes,

     we see TIPTREE with his suitcase, walking along the express

     tracks at the far wall of the tunnel -- more frightened with

     each step.  It's dark and eerie down here in the tunnels; the

     only illumination comes from dim LANTERNS spaced at fifty-foot

     intervals.

     He sees the lights of an EXPRESS TRAIN behind him, and quickly

     switches to the local tracks.  The train rumbles past with a

     deafening blare, and the car lights briefly illuminate his

     surroundings.  TIPTREE glances over at the inside wall of the

     tunnel...

     ...where he sees, huddled in an ALCOVE just off the tracks, a

     small gathering of HOMELESS PEOPLE.  They've set up camp down

     here in the tunnels, away from the elements.  Surrounded by

     bags full of old clothes, DINING on canned food and cheap

     wine, they stare curiously at the well-heeled stranger with

     the suitcase who's invaded their domain.

     TIPTREE eyes them fearfully and picks up his pace, hastening

     down the tunnel.  The HOMELESS make no move to follow -- with

     one exception.  A KID, thirteen or fourteen, in a ratty

     topcoat, climbs down onto the tracks and watches inquisitively

     as TIPTREE vanishes into the shadows.

     His face is familiar.  It's DICK -- the boy vigilante from the

     park.

INT. TUNNEL - FARTHER DOWN TRACKS - A MOMENT LATER

     In this stretch of the tunnel the LANTERNS don't seem to be

     working -- and the MYNAH is completely invisible.  When he

     comes to a fork in the tracks, he has to wait for the sound of

     the bird's shrill voice to guide him:

                               MYNAH

               AWWRRK!  FOLLOW ME.

     TIPTREE stumbles ahead blindly in the darkness.  He trips on

     the tracks and drops the suitcase.  As he's getting to his

     feet, a FLASHLIGHT shines DIRECTLY IN HIS FACE...

                               VOICE

               STOP THERE.

     The MYNAH BIRD flutters through the beam of light and perches

     on the shoulder of an UNSEEN FIGURE.  TIPTREE COWERS and

     SQUINTS, trying to make him out, but the figure who stands

     before him is shielding his face with an open UMBRELLA.

                               TIPTREE

               I've cooperated.  I've done everything you

               said.

                               PENGUIN

               Open the case.

     TIPTREE lifts the lid, revealirig TWO RAVENS in the suitcase.

     A CACKLING LAUGH echoes in the darkness.

                               PENGUIN (cont.)

               ...

Two

 ravens?

                               TIPTREE

               The other one is Bruce Wayne's.

(trembling)

               He doesn't know anything about this.

               You've got what you want.  There's no need

               to --

                               PENGUIN

Thank you

, Mr. Tiptree.  You may go.

     TIPTREE stands.  He backs away from the suitcase warily.

                               TIPTREE

               My family.  You won't --

                               PENGUIN

               We'll certainly take your unexpected

               generosity into consideration.

                               TIPTREE

We

 -- ?!?

(shielding his eyes)

               You're not Batman.

                               PENGUIN

               No.  I'm his brother-in-law -- Birdman.

               Now 

move out

.

INT. TUNNEL - HIGH ANGLE - THAT MOMENT

     TIPTREE marches slowly down the tracks, TOWARD CAMERA,

     silhouetted in the flashlight beam.  The beam SHIFTS SLIGHTLY

     as the Penguin moves toward the suitcase and sets the light

     down --

     -- and we catch sight of the CATWOMAN perched on a steel

     cross-girder above the rails, her CHROME-STEEL TALONS GLINTING

     as she waits for TIPTREE to pass underneath.

INT. TUNNEL - ON TIPTREE

     looking increasingly twitchy as he approaches the cross-

     girder.  He slips a hand into the pocket of his topcoat,

     WHIRLS SUDDENLY --

     -- and brings up his .38 AUTOMATIC, firing THREE QUICK SHOTS

     at the PENGUIN.  The shots RICOCHET LOUDLY off the umbrella --

     which happens to be a bulletproof job.  The PENGUIN lifts his

     brolly; FIRE SPITS out of the shaft --

     -- and TIPTREE staggers backward.  SHOT IN THE CHEST.  He

     spins into a steel upright and topples, face-forward, onto the

     ELECTRIFIED THIRD RAIL -- FRYING HIMSELF in a shower of

     sparks.

     The smoke is still clearing when the CATWOMAN drops to the

     tracks.  The PENGUIN rushes to her side to check TIPTREE for

     signs of life.

                               CATWOMAN

               That 

idiot

.  Another six feet --

                               PENGUIN

               So sorry to spoil your 

fun

.  -- He brought

               two ravens.  We've got a complete set!

                               CATWOMAN

               What??

                               PENGUIN

               Yeah!  They're in the suitcase --

     An AWFUL RUMBLING fills the tunnel.  They see the lights of a

     TRAIN approaching on the center track -- the same one they're

     standing on, the one TIPTREE's body is slumped across.  The

     PENGUIN's first impulse is to run back toward the 

inner

 track,

     where the ravens lie, but the CATWOMAN is trying to drag

     TIPTREE out of the train's path...

                               CATWOMAN

               GIVE ME A HAND!

     They pull the corpse onto the outer express track just as the

     train arrives.  They stand against the outer wall, waiting for

     the train to pass...

     ...and when it does, they see DICK -- the boy vigilante --

     standing on the inner track directly across from them.

     HOLDING THE SUITCASE.  The kid takes off like a shot.  The

     CATWOMAN and the PENGUIN exchange quick looks of utter

     disbelief -- and BOLT AFTER DICK.

INT. TUNNEL - ON DICK

     The bulky suitcase is slowing his progress.  He looks back

     over his shoulder; although the stubby-legged PENGUIN has

     fallen well behind, the CATWOMAN is gaining fast.

     PAGE 101 MISSING FROM HARD COPY

INT. TUNNEL - ON DICK

     watching in the light from the train as the two costumed

     figures grapple in the distance.  He races back toward the

     scene of the melee...

INT. TUNNEL - OUTTER EXPRESS TRACK - THAT MOMENT

     ...where BATMAN and the CATWOMAN are trading punches, blow for

     blow.  He knocks her off her feet with a vicious right hook,

     and she sprawls on the track, dazed and bleeding.  She lifts a

     hand: 

no mas

...

     He looks back toward the suitcase on the center track.  Before

     he can make a move toward it, he spots ANOTHER TRAIN

     approaching on the outer tracks -- right on the heels of the

     last one.  He crouches to pull the CATWOMAN's limp frame out

     of its path...

     ...but as he does so, a HORN BLARES -- and a SECOND TRAIN

     comes barrelling down the center track 

from the opposite

direction

!  Now he's got trains approaching on either side,

     and there's no place to go --

     The CATWOMAN is groggily getting to her feet.  He LUNGES at

     her -- THRUSTS HER BACKWARD, toward an ALCOVE in the outer

     tunnel wall.

INT. TUNNEL - ON DICK - THAT MOMENT

     The OUTER train is already speeding past, obscuring BATMAN and

     the CATWOMAN from view.  The CENTER train is bearing down

     fast.  A split-second before it arrives, DICK'S HAND snatches

     the suitcase out of its path -- and he TUMBLES TO SAFETY on

     the innermost LOCAL TRACK.

     He stands and watches as the two trains pass in opposite

     directions.  He doesn't know if BATMAN is alive or dead...

INT. ALCOVE - THAT MOMENT

     BATMAN and CATWOMAN are flattened in the tiny alcove --

     there's not two inches of breathing space between them and the

     passing TRAIN.  She's come around now, and she's FLAILING and

     CLAWING at him, trying to PUSH HIM OUT.

     HER HAND closes around his UTILITY BELT.  As they struggle,

     she hits the trigger of a SMALL GAS CYLINDER...

     It's BRUCE's hydraulic BATWING DEVICE -- the one that saved

     him when he fell off the roof.  But this time the results are

     altogether different.  He GASPS IN HORROR as the WINGS OF HIS

     CAPE stiffen and inflate -- FORCING HIM AWAY FROM THE WALL OF

     THE TUNNEL.

     His OUTER WING strikes the TRAIN -- FLAPPING WILDLY against

     the passing CARS -- SNAGGING FINALLY on the ralling of the

     rearmost car --

     -- and BATMAN is suddenly RIPPED OUT OF THE ALCOVE -- DRAGGED

     OFF DOWN THE TRACKS by the passing train!

INT. TUNNEL - INNERMOST TRACK - ON DICK

     He's still there with the suitcase -- waiting apprehensively

     to see what's become of BATMAN.  Finally the center train

     passes --

     -- and he sees CATWOMAN standing ALONE IN THE ALCOVE --

     smiling at him -- advancing menacingly.  DICK TURNS TO RUN...

     A GUNSHOT rings out -- and the last thing he sees as he slumps

     to the tracks is a whiff of SMOKE pluming from the shaft of

     the PENGUIN'S UMBRELLA.

     The PENGUIN's panting -- soaked with sweat.  The CATWOMAN

     snatches up the suitcase and rushes over to join him.  She

     peers off into the tunnels after BATMAN, exhilarated...

                               CATWOMAN

God

.  Did you see him? Isn't he 

hot

?

                               PENGUIN

               Haven't you got anything else to think

               about?

(mopping sweat from his brow)

I'm

 hot.  That was 

exhausting

.

                               CATWOMAN

               No pain, no gain!  -- Suck it up.  We're

               not out of here yet.

     She sprints off down the tracks.  SQUAWKING, he waddles along

     behind her, as fast as his fat little legs will carry him...

     As they vanish into the darkness, the CAMERA TRACKS back --

     past DICK, who lies unconscious on the tracks, bleeding

     heavily from his shoulder wound -- DEEPER INTO THE MAZE OF

     TUNNELS --

     -- arriving finally on the ragged black figure of BATMAN as he

     staggers forth from the shadows, dazed and bloody.  He scans

     the tunnel, finding no trace of his enemies -- and then his

     gaze falls on DICK.

     He limps over and KNEELS at the boy's side -- cradling his

     head protectively, staring helplessly into the blackness all

     around him...

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. GOTHAM CITY SKYLINE - NIGHT

     The stark outlines of the city, BATHED IN MOONLIGHT.  CAMERA

     ZEROES IN on the glowing, ornamental DOME of CITY HALL...

INT. CITY HALL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     A PENTAGONAL BALCONY girds the interior of the dome.  We TILT

     DOWN to ground level -- where TWO AGED SECURITY GUARDS lie

     sprawled at odd angles on the marble floor, FATALLY SHOT.

     The PENGUIN closes his gun-umbrella and waddles across the

     atrium of City Hall, past a statue of blind Justice, to a

     point directly under the dome.  There, encased in a plexiglass

     case, is a SCALE MODEL of GOTHAM CITY -- circa 1885, when City

     Hall was erected.  He shouts up:

                               PENGUIN

               LETS DO IT!

INT. CITY HALL - BALCONY UNDER DOME - THAT MOMENT

     The CATWOMAN, FRICK, and FRACK are already up on the balcony.

     Lining its periphery are various DISPLAY CASES of historical

     interest; and positioned along the wall at each point of the

     pentagon are FIVE ARCHED NICHES -- each one containing a

     bronze bust.  The patriarchs of Gotham's Five Families...

     The CATWOMAN and co. go to work quickly.  She removes the FIVE

     RAVENS from a gunny sack as FRICK and FRACK work their way

     around the balcony, YANKING the busts from their recessed

     bases.  She follows along behind them, replacing each bust

     with a RAVEN.

     When they're done, the PENGUIN yells up:

                               PENGUIN

               Now.  Give each raven a quarter-turn.

     His pals in the dome oblige -- TWISTING each raven in its

     recessed socket, in quick succession...

INT. CITY HALL - ATRIUM - ON PENGUIN

     The moment of maximum tension.  He stands there frothing at

     the mouth with anticipation.  SECONDS TICK OFF, and nothing

     happens.

                               CATWOMAN

               What happens now?

                               PENGUIN

               I don't know.  That's all...!

     He looks around expectantly as the others peer down at him

     from above.  He really 

doesn't

 know what's supposed to happen

     next.  Suspecting the worst, he throws his umbrella to the

     floor and begins STAMPING ABOUT IN A RAGE, SPUTTERING,

     flapping his arms like wings.

                               PENGUIN (cont.)

               We've been TRICKED!  It's a HOAX!  It's

               a --

     He SHUTS UP suddenly at the sound of a loud CHUNK.  Somewhere

     behind him, ANCIENT GEARS are beginning to grind.  He spins

     and stares at the SCALE MODEL of GOTHAM in its plexiglass

     case...

     The city model is TREMBLING slightly.  As he watches, the DOME

     of the miniature CITY HALL -- in the dead center of the model

     city -- POPS OFF on a hinge.  A METAL STRONGBOX rises into

     view...

INT. DOME - ON BALCONY - THAT MOMENT

     The CATWOMAN, FRICK and FRACK stare down at the little metal

     box.  The PENGUIN is already clambering atop the plexiglass

     case of the model, SMASHING AT IT with his umbrella, trying to

     get at the box.

                               FRICK

That's

 the treasure?

                               CATWOMAN

               No.  It's a 

map

...

     She affixes a ROPE to the balcony railing and CLIMBS OVER.

INT. CITY HALL - ATRIUM - ON PENGUIN

     The plexiglass case finally SHATTERS -- and the PENGUIN falls

     through, landing atop Gotham City.  He snatches at the

     strongbox and gets to his feet, bestriding the city like a

     colossus.  He's climbing down off the tabletop when the

     CATWOMAN, on her rope, touches down behind him.

     He hunkers down on the floor and knocks the rusted padlock off

     the box.  He opens it and stares greedily at the contents -- a

     MAP and a bunch of old, crumbling PHOTOS.  The CATWOMAN creeps

     over to his side:

                               PENGUIN

Bruce Wayne

.  So he doesn't know a thing

               about the treasure, eh...?

(handing her the map)

Look

 at this.  

It's right under Wayne

Manor

.  It's been there 

all along

!

     Now the CATWOMAN snatches at the PHOTOS.  They show

     progressively closer views of ANCIENT GNARLED STALACTITES --

     an odd, distinctive SUBTERRANEAN ROCK FORMATION...

                               PENGUIN (cont.)

               Looks like some kind of 

cave

.

FADE THROUGH TO:

INT. WAYNE MANOR - GUEST BEDROOM - DAY

     TIGHT ON THE FACE of DICK.  He lies unconscious in a big soft

     frilly bed A WOMAN'S HAND wipes his feverish brow with a damp

     cloth; he moans slightly...

     His eyes snap open suddenly.  He sits BOLT UPRIGHT with a

     yelp.

                               VICKI

               No, no -- don't try to get up -- you're

               hurt.

     He pushes her aside and climbs out of bed anyway.  His

     shoulder is bandaged, his arm in a sling.  The pajamas he's

     wearing are three sizes too large.  He paces about, staring at

     his unfamiliar surroundings.

                               VICKI (cont.)

               It's all right.  You're safe.  You can

               stay here as long as you need to.

                               DICK

               I don't belong here.  You can't keep me

               here.

     Vaguely unnerved, he goes to a window, pulls back the shades,

     looks out at the grounds.

                               VICKI

               It's "Dick", isn't it?  Or do you prefer

               "Richard"?

     He stares at her as if she's nuts.  VICKI opens a closet door:

     all of his ratty belongings are hanging inside -- including

     the red-and-green GYMNAST'S SUIT with the "R" insigne on the

     breast.

                               VICKI

               "R" -- for Richard, right?  See, all your

               things are here...

(staring at the costume)

               What is it, some kind of gymnast's outfit?

                               DICK

               It's none of your business.  What is this,

               some kind of home?

                               VICKI

               No, not 

that

 kind.  There's a swimming

               pool -- tennis court -- you can have

               anything you want.

                               DICK

               Tennis court?!  -- Lady, you're rich.  How

               the hell would you know what 

I

 want?

     VICKI tries to lay a soothing arm on his shoulder.  He bats it

     away, pushes her aside and turns toward the door in

     agitation --

                               DICK

               I'm not staying.  You can't 

make

 me --

     -- and sees BRUCE standing in the doorway looking at him.

                               BRUCE

               I can make you.

     DICK freezes -- as if BRUCE's mere presence has mesmerized

     him.  The hint of a smile plays across his face: ohhhhh.  I'm

     in 

Batman's

 house.

                               BRUCE (cont.)

               Come on.  Wanna go at it?

(no response)

               Look, kid -- like it or not, you're my

               guest -- and long as you're here you might

               as well enjoy it.

     ALFRED appears with a tray of hot food and sets it down on a

     bedside table.  DICK edges toward it and sits down.  He waits

     for ALFRED to leave and then TUCKS IN HUNGRILY -- eyeing BRUCE

     all the while.

                               BRUCE (cont.)

               Will you two be okay in here?

     VICKI nods yes.  BRUCE backs out of the room.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - OUTSIDE GUEST ROOM - DAY

     BRUCE pulls the door shut.  ALFRED follows him down the hall.

                               ALFRED

               What do you propose to do with him, sir?

               Keep him in the room for the rest of his

               life?

                               BRUCE

               I don't know, Alfred.  I've got other

               stuff to worry about.

                               ALFRED

               The child is hurt, sir.  At the very least

               we should attempt to locate his parents.

                               BRUCE

               He hasn't got any parents.

                               ALFRED

               How do you know that, sir?

     BRUCE turns and fixes ALFRED with a steely gaze.

                               BRUCE

               ...I know.

     The PHONE RINGS as BRUCE starts down the long stairway.

     ALFRED picks up a hallway extension.  He covers the

     mouthpiece:

                               ALFRED

               Sir -- it's Miss Kyle.

     BRUCE rushes back upstairs to take the call.

INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - THAT MOMENT - DAY

     ARCTIC BIRDS chirping all around in the penguin-pool room.  A

     SNOW OWL struts across the PENGUIN's desk as SELINA makes a

     phone call -- with the PENGUIN, FRICK, and FRACK hovering over

     her.

                               SELINA

               Well!  Tall, dark and handsome.  Are we

               still on for tonight?

INT. WAYNE MANOR - ON BRUCE

     He covers the receiver and stares intensely at ALFRED.  On his

     look we

INT. WAYNE MANOR - FRONT PARLOR - NIGHT

     Christmas carols playing.  VICKI's got DICK helping her trim

     the tree.

INT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     BRUCE is getting dressed for his date with SELINA.

                               ALFRED

               Is this necessary, sir?  After all...it 

is

               Christmas eve.

     BRUCE reaches for his UTILITY BELT.  He empties the contents

     of one packet onto a dresser: a dozen tiny, red GLASSINE

     CAPSULES.  He scoops up a handful of the CAPSULES and deposits

     them in his jacket pocket.

                               BRUCE

               Stuff'll knock out a moose, much less a

               cat.

                               ALFRED

               I don't like to see you going out on a

               date...unprotected, sir.

                               BRUCE

               She'll be ready for Batman -- but not for

me

.

(turning to go)

               It's the only way, Alfred.  I've got to

               take her out tonight.

INT. ENTRY HALL - FIVE MINUTES LATER (DICK'S POV)

     DICK watches from the front parlor as VICKI meets BRUCE at the

     bottom of the stairs.  The two of them exchange a few brief

     words; he embraces her, strokes her hair gently -- then glumly

     sets his jaw and moves off toward the front door.

     VICKI reenters the parlor, trying to force an expression of

     cheer as DICK turns discreetly away.  This is one weird

     household he's landed in...

INT. SELINA'S LOFT - NIGHT

     SOFT MUSIC plays in the background as SELINA preens in front

     of a vanity, doing her eye makeup, taking great pleasure in

     her own reflection.  She's looking especially sultry tonight

     in a glittering low-cut gown.  She lowers one shoulder strap

     and strikes a pose in the mirror: better.  She runs a hand

     through her hair, TOUSLING IT for that recently-ravished look.

     The DOORBELL rings, and by the time SELINA crosses over to

     answer it, she's lowered the other strap as well -- which

     means she has to hold up the top of her dress with one hand.

     BRUCE finds himsell dumbstruck as she lets him in.  She pulls

     up both straps as she greets him nonchalantly:

                               SELINA

               You're early.  I'm afraid I'm not quite

               dressed.

     BRUCE enters and takes a long look around.  It's a big open

     loft, only partly finished, filled with Egyptian artifacts.

     The walls feature modern paintings with CAT MOTIFS.  The

     finished section is dominated by a huge BED on a raised

     platform -- three or four CATS are walking around on it,

     yowling at BRUCE.  SELINA CHUCKLES as he scopes it all out.

                               SELINA (cont.)

               If you're looking for my bondage gear,

               it's at the cleaners.

                               BRUCE

               Christmas eve.  No tree?

                               SELINA

               No presents.  I've been a bad girl this

               year.

     BRUCE takes a seat on the sofa while SELINA goes to a nearby

     wet bar.

                               BRUCE

               I'm surprised you kept this date.  I

               thought you would've lost interest by now.

                               SELINA

               What makes you say that?

                               BRUCE

               You've got what you want, don't you?

                               SELINA

               I do 

now

.

(smiling)

               We've had this date for a long, long time.

     With that, she sets the drinks down on the table and moves in

     to KISS him -- a long, slow, wet kiss.  But BRUCE seems

     strangely unresponsive.  She breaks free and gives him a funny

     look.

                               BRUCE

               How much is it going to cost me?

                               SELINA

               What?

                               BRUCE

               ...To get the ravens back.

     He watches her closely for a reaction.  SELINA's shocked, but

     she conceals it well -- chuckling in apparent confusion.

                               SELINA

               You're the oddest man I've ever met.

(moving in on him)

               Let's talk later, Bruce.  I've got kind of

               a short fuse...

     BRUCE tenses slightly as she KISSES him again -- leaving a

     crimson LIPSTICK SMEAR on his cheek.  She works her way

     downward, kissing him around his neck and throat...

     HIS HAND reaches into his jacket pocket.  He withdraws a tiny

     GLASSINE CAPSULE.  But before he can use it --

     He JERKS BACK suddenly -- pushes her away.  His free hand goes

     to his neck, where a thin trickle of BLOOD is oozing from

     between two bright red LIPSTICK LIPS.  She's 

bitten

 him...

     Now she SHUSHES him -- reaches over to the tiny wound and

     massages it gently with one hand.

                               SELINA

               Did I hurt you?  Just relax -- you'll

               start to enjoy it.

     BRUCE pulls away again.  His eyes are strangely glazed.  He

     tries to speak, but his tongue feels thick and swollen.

                               SELINA (cont.)

               Bruce, you look faint.  It must be the

               cats.

     BRUCE stands suddenly.  It's as if he's mired in a slo-mo

     nightmare.  His legs give way beneath him and he topples to

     the floor, INERT.  His fingers go slack and the capsule rolls

     out; he tries to reach into his pocket, but his arm won't seem

     to work.

     SELINA's cat, HECATE, strolls across his prostrate form --

     purring and stretching...

BRUCE'S POV

     A worm's-eye view -- SELINA looms over him with a predatory

     smile on her face, shifting in and out of focus.

                               BRUCE

               What di-- what did you d--

     She runs a finger across her lips and holds it up -- bright

     red.

                               SELINA

               I guess I've...gotten under your skin.

BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE

     His hand goes to the BITE on his neck -- and he realizes

     SELINA's lipstick is spiked with a fast-acting PARALYTIC DRUG.

     He writhes helplessly on the carpet, his whole body gradually

     going slack.

     The PENGUIN, FRICK and FRACK stroll through the doorway and

     stand over him -- ALL LAUGHING...

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

     A COUNTY SHERIFF'S CAR cruises past the manor, right on

     schedule.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - PARLOR - NIGHT

     ALFRED on the telephone, checking in with the County Sheriff's

     boys.

                               ALFRED

               Everything's fine, thank you.  We'll talk

               in an hour.

     Behind him, VICKI is waiting up for BRUCE.  She's curled up on

     the sofa, reading a book, throwing the occasional anxious

     glance at a big grandfather clock -- which strikes eleven

     o'clock.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT

     DICK opens the bedroom door and peeks down the hall.  He's got

     all his belongings tied up in a bundle on the bed; he opens a

     window and throws the bundle outside.

     There's a nice strong TREE BRANCH some ten or twelve feet from

     the window -- just close enough that he should be able to make

     it.  He climbs up onto the windowsill, crouches, and SPRINGS.

INT. CAR - OUTSIDE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     A car full of trouble: SELINA, wearing a fur coat over her

     Catwoman garb, at the wheel; the PENGUIN riding shotgun; and

     FRICK in the back seat -- next to BRUCE, who's semi-conscious

     and stone limp.  The car idles outside the wrought-iron gates

     of Wayne Manor.

                               PENGUIN

               Try his mag card.

     FRICK digs in BRUCE's pockets and finds a bunch of RED

     CAPSULES.

                               FRICK

               Look at this.  He's a pillhead.

     Now FRICK finds a mag-striped card and INSERTS IT into an

     electronic device at the edge of the drive.  The gates

     magically part.  There's a large VAN just behind the car --

     driven by FRACK, and carrying two random GOONS.  Both vehicles

     pull in before the gates slide shut.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - A MOMENT LATER

     VICKI hears a signal from the security panel in the kitchen

     announcing what should be BRUCE's arrival.  She heaves a huge

     sigh of relief -- then rushes to the door and flings it open.

     She sees BRUCE standing there and her face lights up.

                               VICKI

               Ohh.  Am I glad to --

     To her horror, BRUCE topples forward -- and lands on the

     floor, flat as a board.  VICKI SHRIEKS as the PENGUIN enters,

     throwing his arms wide.

                               PENGUIN

               MER-R-R-RY CHRISTMAS!!

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     DICK has shimmied down to a lower branch.  He lets go and

     drops to the snow, WINCING; his shoulder wound is bleeding

     again.  As he grabs his bundle, he hears RAUCOUS LAUGHTER

     coming from around the house.

     He races over to peer around the corner.  He sees the two cars

     out front.  He sees the last of the goon squad barging in

     through the front door.

     His face full of confusion and conflict, he moves to a window.

     In the entry hall he sees BRUCE on the floor -- and VICKI

     surrounded by gun-toting intruders.  One of them grabs her and

     twists her arm behind her back.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY - THAT MOMENT

     VICKI shrieking and struggling as she stares down at BRUCE.

                               VICKI

               What did you 

do

 to him??

     SELINA gives her a catty little smile.

                               SELINA

               First-time jitters, I guess.  Everything

               was going great, and then...he just went

               limp as a noodle.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - ON STAIRWAY

     Drawn by the commotion, ALFRED rushes down the stairs to the

     entry hall, pulling a robe around him.  He freezes in his

     tracks when he sees FRICK dragging VICKI into the front

     parlor, holding a gun to her head.

                               PENGUIN

               You'd be the butler.  Why don't you come

               on down and attend to your guests?

     ALFRED hesitates, until the PENGUIN pulls a gun on 

him

.  He

     marches down the stairs slowly, pausing by BRUCE's prostrate

     form.

                               ALFRED

               Mr. Wayne.  Is he -- ?

                               PENGUIN

               You know how it is.  Some guys just can't

               hold their egg nog.

INT. FRONT PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER

     The PENGUIN marches ALFRED in where the rest of the gang's

     already assembled.  FRICK throws VICKI down roughly on a sofa

     just next to the Christmas tree while the GOONS drag BRUCE

     inside.

                               PENGUIN

               I should explain the occasion of our

               visit.  There's a treasure underneath this

               house -- and I don't plan to leave until

               you tell me how to find it.  Now who's

               going to talk -- Miss Vale?

                               VICKI

               I don't know what you're talking about.

                               PENGUIN

               The 

cave

.  Under the house.  How do I get

               there?

     The PENGUIN gestures.  FRICK holds the gun to her head.

                               VICKI (cont.)

               I don't know!  I swear, I would tell

               you --

                               PENGUIN

(turning to ALFRED)

               Then maybe 

you'd

 like to tell me.

                               ALFRED

               You're no more than a common thief.

                               PENGUIN

               Wrong, you old idiot.  I happen to be a

               very 

un

common thief.

(beat)

               Are you going to tell me, or does Miss

               Vale get an early present this year?

     FRICK cocks the gun.  VICKI stares aghast at ALFRED, who scans

     the room, weighing his options.  Trembling, he shuts his

     eyes --

                               ALFRED

               I...don't...know...

                               PENGUIN

               Then go ahead, Mr. Frick...

decorate the

tree

.

     FRICK's finger tightens on the trigger.  VICKI winces.  ALFRED

     starts to blurt something out.  But a split-second before he

     can speak --

                               SELINA

               Wait!

(crossing over to VICKI)

               We don't know how to get down there yet.

               We may need her when Bruce wakes up.

     The PENGUIN sighs and waves FRICK off.  ALFRED and VICKI heave

     simultaneous sighs of relief.  He throws her a shamefaced look

     -- but she gives him a tiny nod of acknowledgement: you made

     the right play.

                               SELINA (cont.)

               Besides -- I want this one for myself.  So

               pretty...I'm going to give her a brand new

               face for Christmas.

     The PENGUIN throws a look at BRUCE, who's still out cold on

     the floor.  He turns to FRICK and FRACK.

                               PENGUIN

               Why don't you two tie up our host?

     ALFRED sits beside VICKI while SELINA wanders off to tour the

     premises.  FRICK and FRACK, meanwhile, drag BRUCE into a back

     parlor which opens off the room they're in.

INT. BACK PARLOR - THAT MOMENT

     They dump BRUCE face down on a sofa -- then rip the telephone

     cords from around the baseboard and use them to bind his hands

     and feet.

INT. FRONT PARLOR - ON MR. BONIFACE

     Still holding his gun on VICKI and ALFRED, he wanders about

     the room, admiring the various furnishings and expensive

objects

.

                               PENGUIN

               It's all so plush and tasteful, isn't it?

               Just the sort of setting in which I've

               always imagined myself.

     ALFRED, on the sofa, can't resist letting out a snort of

     disgust.

                               PENGUIN (cont.)

               I see.  You think I'm vulgar.  You think

               I'm...

nouveau

.

                               ALFRED

               I think you're a dirty little man with

               a --

     The PENGUIN silences him by sweeping one arm across a

     tabletop, sending a bunch of PRICELESS CHINA FIGURINES

     crashing to the floor.  He points to ALFRED as FRICK and FRACK

     reappear.

                               PENGUIN

               See, boys, that's old money talking.

               After a while, they actually start to

               believe they've 

earned

 all this.

(smirking)

               I don't mind.  Someday I'll be old money

               too -- when the statute of limitations

               runs out.

                               SELINA (O.S.)

               Hey!  -- Guess what I just found.

     Face full of anticipation, he TURNS -- just in time to see

     SELINA returning from the kitchen with a big silver tray of...

                               SELINA (cont.)

               Christmas cookies!

     The PENGUIN is crestfallen, but that doesn't stop him from

     cramming a handful of cookies down his gullet.  SELINA

     graciously serves VICKI and ALFRED, who munch away with

     limited enthusiasm.

                               PENGUIN

               Let's spread out and see what we can find.

(to FRICK and FRACK)

               You two -- keep an eye on our friends

               here.  Give me a yell the minute Wayne

               comes to.

     FRICK and FRACK post themselves at the doors to the front

     parlor as SELINA, the PENGUIN and the GOONS fan out through

     the house.  CAMERA TRACKS WITH THEM as they move past BRUCE --

     -- and in a quick CLOSEUP we see his EYES OPEN -- his hands

     STRUGGLING against his bonds.

SERIES OF SHOTS

     QUICK GLIMPSES of the intruders enacting their depredations as

     they search for the entrance to the cave.  SELINA and the

     PENGUIN are flinging open doors, moving clocks, looking for

     secret panels; as they go, they systematically TEAR THE HOUSE

     APART -- smashing BRUCE's possessions, ripping paintings out

     of frames, etc.

     Meanwhile, the TWO GOONS are outside prowling around the

     grounds, looking for an exterior entrance -- and back in the

     parlor, FRICK and FRACK are keeping their guns trained on

     ALFRED and VICKI.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - CORRIDOR OFF KITCHEN - NIGHT

     CAMERA TRACKS down a long, empty hallway -- arriving at a

     LOCKED DOOR with curtained-off glass panels.  Suddenly, an

     ELBOW smashes through the glass -- a hand reaches inside and

     fumbles for the lock --

INT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT

     FRICK and FRACK start at the sound of a SECURITY ALARM blaring

     from the kitchen.  VICKI looks at ALFRED...

                               FRICK

               Better check it out.

     FRICK stays behind as FRACK rushes out into the entryway and

     down a long hall to the kitchen.  He tosses a glance back at

     VICKI and ALFRED, then steps out into the entryway himself.

                               FRICK (cont.)

               What is it?  What's going on??

     VICKI and ALFRED look into the back parlor.  DICK GRAYSON has

     sneaked in behind the sofa -- and he's busy sawing away at

     BRUCE's bonds with a letter opener.  Both of them stiffen

     simultaneously -- if FRICK steps back inside, he'll have a

     clear view of DICK and BRUCE.

INT. KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT

     FRACK has opened a panel on the kitchen wall, revealing the

     SECURITY SYSTEM from which the alarm emanates.  A RED LIGHT is

     blinking, indicating DICK's break-in.  FRACK throws switches

     frantically, trying to kill the sound.  Finally he succeeds --

     and SHOUTS:

                               FRACK

               Some kind of security system --

INT. BACK PARLOR - THAT MOMENT

     DICK's gotten BRUCE free -- but BRUCE, still under the effects

     of the drug, isn't much use.  He tries to get off the sofa and

     crumples in a heap.

                               DICK

               Can you 

move

, man?

                               BRUCE

               Library -- got to get me to the library --

     DICK slings an arm around BRUCE and drags him to a door

     opening onto the hallway.  They're just about to step outside

     when FRACK comes marching back on his way from the kitchen.

INT. FRONT PARLOR - ON VICKI AND ALFRED

     -- faces wracked with utter, desperate tension as they watch

     the situation develop.

INT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT

     FRICK and FRACK conferring, ignoring VICKI and ALFRED for the

     moment.  By now the PENGUIN is waddling in from a hallway:

                               PENGUIN

               What is that ungodly racket?

                               FRACK

               A security alarm.  It went off in the

               kitchen.

                               PENGUIN

               My God!  Is someone 

in

 here?

     He struts over to huddle with his cronies.  BRUCE and DICK are

     still poised in the doorway.  It looks bad...

INT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT

     ALFRED looks at BRUCE and DICK -- then at FRICK and FRACK

     bickering with the PENGUIN in the entryway.  He pats VICKI's

     knee -- gestures for her to keep her seat --

     -- and LUNGES at FRICK, making a play for his gun.  A moment

     of confusion ensues -- giving DICK and BRUCE just enough time

     to dart out into the hallway, duck around a corner, and

     vanish --

     -- but ALFRED is a frail old gent, and he can't keep it up for

     long; a blow to the face sends him sprawling to the floor.

     FRICK instinctively pulls the trigger and SHOOTS HIM at point-

     blank range.

     VICKI rushes into the hallway -- screaming, crying.

INT. LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT

     The room's a mess, books all over the floor.  The groggy BRUCE

     props himself up against his desk.  He manages to pull the

     bottom drawer open -- gropes frantically for the secret

     switch.  He's CRYING.

                               BRUCE

               Alfred...

                               DICK

               I'll go back.

                               BRUCE

               I can't...get down there...without you.

     DICK turns.  To his amazement, the sectional bookcase is

     swinging open -- revealing the secret passage to the BATCAVE.

INT. ENTRY HALL/FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT

     We will all be pleased to know that ALFRED has only suffered a

     superficial wound to the arm.  VICKI is on her knees beside

     him; the PENGUIN is watching them with utter contempt.

                               PENGUIN

               What an extraordinarily stupid thing to

               do.

                               VICKI

               SHUT UP.  Help me with him.

     The PENGUIN rolls his eyes and orders FRICK and FRACK to give

     VICKI a hand without him.  They carry him into the parlor, lay

     him out on the sofa.  VICKI reaches into her purse for a

     handkerchief and begins binding his wound as the PENGUIN pulls

     FRACK aside.

                               PENGUIN

               You and I had better check the ground

               floor and see what's going on.  Mr. Frick

               -- do you think you'll be able to manage

               this pair?

                               FRICK

               Yes sir.

                               PENGUIN

               Oh, good.  That 

does

 relieve my mind --

     He turns, glances into the back parlor, and sees a pile of CUT

     CORDS on the love seat.  The blood drains out of his face.

                               PENGUIN (cont.)

Where's Wayne

???

INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT

     DICK has just entered another world -- and he's looking around

     him in pure, unalloyed amazement.  BRUCE is fumbling with a

     packet on a spare UTILITY BELT; he shakes out a fistful of

     pills and swallows them dry.

     Then he goes to his bank of monitors and begins flipping

     switches.  They blink on one by one; DICK moves up behind

     BRUCE and looks on, dazzled.

INSERT - MONITOR

     The screen shows The PENGUIN in a sun room, shouting to his

     two armed GOONS through a pair of French doors.

                               PENGUIN

               Check the grounds!  The shape he's in, he

               can't have gotten far.

BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE

     He turns to his main control panel, reaches for a switch, and

     waits.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The two GOONS outside, with guns and flashlights, roaming

     cautiously around the grounds.  They turn suddenly --

     -- as CORRUGATED-STEEL SECURITY PANELS slam into place over

     every ground-floor door and window in Wayne Manor!

INT. SUN ROOM - THAT MOMENT

     The PENGUIN sees the same thing happening, only from inside.

     He listens helplessly as his GOONS pound on the steel panels

     from outside.  It's just occurred to him that he's trapped in

     here...

INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER

     DICK is up on a catwalk leading back to the library of Wayne

     Manor.  BRUCE shouts up to him from the control console down

     below.

                               BRUCE

               -- as soon as he gets to the East wing.

               Wait for my signal.  You know what to do.

     DICK nods yes and bolts off.

INT. FRONT PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER

     VICKI and ALFRED are still sitting at gunpoint.  With the

     commotion going on all around them, FRICK is getting itchy-

     fingered.

     Suddenly the STEREO begins blaring at top volwne -- "SANTA

     BRING MY BABY BACK TO ME."  FRICK turns and stares at it in

     confusion -- goes over to fiddle with the controls --

     -- and suddenly BRUCE'S VOICE is coming through the

     loudspeakers.

                               BRUCE (O.S.; filter)

               VICKI!  RUN!  NOW!

     She's off the sofa like a shot, DIVING for the entry hall.

     FRICK turns and takes aim --

     -- but before he can squeeze the trigger, DICK's come out of

     nowhere to HIGH-KICK him in the face!  The shot goes wild and

     the two of them tumble into the Christmas tree, knocking it

     over...

INT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT

     VICKI hits the floor of the entry hall.  HUGE OAKEN SLIDING

     DOORS are already slamming shut behind her.  The same thing is

     happening all down the hall -- the East wing of the house is

     sealing itself off!

INT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT

     DICK CARTWHEELS across the carpet -- catching FRICK high on

     the chest and RAMMING him backward, into the hearth.  Before

     FRICK can regain his balance, DICK's BEANED HIM across the

     back of the skull with a fireplace poker.

     He bends and picks up FRICK's gun -- which he tosses to

     ALFRED, who's been watching all this with some fascination

     from the sofa.

                               DICK

               Here.  You might need it.

                               ALFRED

               Thank you, Master Dick.  And...

bravo

.

INT. KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT

     VICKI has made it to the wall phone.  She can't seem to get a

     dial tone --

                               VOICE FROM BEHIND

               Do you really think we're 

that

 stupid?

     VICKI turns, and realizes to her horror that the VOICE is

     SELINA's.

                               SELINA (cont.)

               I tawt I taw a puddy tat...!!

     With that she raises a hand -- and her CLAWS pop out.  VICKI

     turns, grabs a carving knife from a wooden block -- but before

     she can do anything with it, a WHIP cracks and wraps around

     her wrist, jerking the knife loose.  SELINA tugs on the other

     end, reeling her closer.

                               SELINA

               You know, I've got a great recipe for

               Sliced Bitch --

     VICKI lunges forward suddenly, causing the whip to slacken and

     throwing SELINA off-balance into the center island.  While

     they're tangled up, VICKI grabs a MEAT CLEAVER and tries to

     bring it down on SELINA, but SELINA rolls effortlessly out of

     the way and returns the favor, SWIPING at VICKI with her

     claws.  VICKI brings a Calphalon skillet up just in time to

     block the blow: CLANG.

     VICKI sweeps her arm across the countertop, showering SELINA

     with knives and appliances.  It buys her enough time to make

     for the door -- but SELINA comes flying after her.  Another

     downswipe with the claws -- but VICKI shoves a BUTCHER'S BLOCK

     into SELINA's path, and her TALONS wedge a half-inch deep in

     the wood.

     VICKI rushes out while she's trying to pry herself loose.

INT. DINING HALL - A MOMENT LATER

     SELINA enters but finds no trace of VICKI.

                               SELINA

               I love a good old-fashioned catfight --

               but this is pissing me off.

     VICKI charges out from behind a sideboard, pushing a WHEELED

     COCKTAIL CART before her.  It SLAMS full-force into SELINA,

     who lands on her back on the great long dining table.  VICKI

     is in the doorway to the entry hall by the time she gets up.

INT. ENTRY HALL - STAIRWAY - A MOMENT LATER

     VICKI races up the stairs.  She has a good lead, but SELINA

     makes up the difference in a hurry.  She takes the stairway in

     three giant bounds -- reaches the landing just as VICKI ducks

     down the hall and into a bedroom, slamming the door behind her

     and LOCKING IT.

                               SELINA

               HERE, kitty kitty kitty...HERE, kitty

               kitty...

     She KICKS THE DOOR OPEN.

INT. BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

     SELINA enters and strikes a coy pose as she shuts the door

     behind her.  VICKI has opened a pair of French doors leading

     to a balcony, but it's too long a drop.  She stands there

     paralyzed as SELINA advances.

                               SELINA

               So this is where you earn your keep.

     She GRABS VICKI -- holds her out at arm's length and shoves

     her roughly back onto the bed.  VICKI flails wildly as SELINA

     kneels atop her...

     SELINA's CLAWS shred VICKI's blouse, revealing a frilly

     section of bra --

                               SELINA

               Mmm!  Frederick's of Gotham?

     She plants a talon against VICKI's sternum and RAKES IT

     DOWNWARD, drawing a RED STRIPE on the exposed flesh of VICKI's

     belly.  Now VICKI just loses it.  She begins to SHRIEK

     uncontrollably.

                               SELINA

               Not so loud, honey!  The neighbors'll get

               the wrong idea.

(laughing)

               Santa's coming.  Time for all good girls

               to go to sleep...

     She raises her claw-hand and prepares to slash down at VICKI's

     neck.  But an instant before she can strike -- VICKI goes

     wide-eyed and shuts up.  A BLACK SHADOW falls across the

     moonlit bed.  SELINA tenses --

     -- as a BLACK-GLOVED HAND grabs a fistful of her hair --

                               BATMAN

               Miss me, "Angel"?

     He yanks her bodily off the bed.  Before she knows what's

     happening, he delivers a POWERHOUSE UPPERCUT.  She flies into

     the door and knocks it cleanly off its hinges.

INT. HALLWAY/STAIRCASE - A MOMENT LATER

     BATMAN steps out after SELINA, who's only now picking herself

     up.

                               SELINA

               Okay -- let's do it, huh?  You and me...

               all the way this time.

     She HISSES and jumps him.  They grapple -- a quick flurry of

     fists -- and he knocks her ass-over-teakettle down the long

     stairway.

     She gets to her feet, limping, and darts around a corner.

     BATMAN marches implacably down the stairs, taking his time...

INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER

     VICKI rushes out of the bedroom.  She looks down the hall and

     sees FRACK flying out of the guest room, UPSIDE DOWN --

     slamming into the wall opposite.  He slumps to the carpet, out

     cold.

     A moment later DICK strolls out.  VICKI rushes to his side --

                               VICKI

               Come on.  We'll be safe in the cave.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY/ARMORY - A MOMENT LATER

     BATMAN PAUSES outside the door to the armory, which is

     slightly ajar.  He pushes it in cautiously...

     ...and a HALBERD smashes through the wood frame -- slicing

     down mere inches from his face.  It's the PENGUIN wielding the

     ax; he backs off in seeming terror as BATMAN advances on him.

     But then --

     -- SELINA springs down from a perch above the doors -- landing

     on his back -- and the two of them are going at it again.

     It's a room full of exotic weaponry, and most of it gets a

     good workout in the next thirty seconds.

     BATMAN dodges a LANCE -- which embeds itself into the wall

     behind him, QUIVERING -- and swings a MACE squarely into

     SELINA's ribs.  It's a crippling blow; she flies backward,

     knocking over a suit of exotic armor -- which TOPPLES,

     knocking over another -- and another --

     -- until the various suits of armor have all fallen over,

     domino-style -- the last of them landing squarely atop the

     cowering PENGUIN.

     SELINA is badly hurt now.  She makes it out of a rear door to

     the armory.  BATMAN pauses to check on the PENGUIN -- he seems

     to be out for the count -- and sets off in pursuit of SELINA.

     SEVERAL MOMENTS PASS before the groaning PENGUIN comes around

     enough to dig himself out.

INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER

     As the PENGUIN stumbles around a corner, he peers into the

     LIBRARY.  VICKI is crouched by BRUCE's desk, reaching into a

     bottom drawer.  A hidden panel in the bookcase pops open...

INT. LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT

     As she helps ALFRED into the secret passageway, VICKI turns to

     DICK:

                               VICKI

               Come on.  Come with us.

                               DICK

               No.  I can still help...

INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER

     The PENGUIN flattens against the wall as DICK sprints out of

     the library and heads off in the opposite direction.  There's

     a flabbergasted look on his face -- he 

recognizes

 this kid.

WIPE TO:

INT. BATCAVE - A MINUTE LATER

     At the monitor bank, watching BATMAN's pursuit of SELINA, are

     VICKI and ALFRED.  They pivot suddenly at the sound of a

     VOICE:

                               PENGUIN

               Such primitive entertainment.

     He's holding a gun on the two of them.  He stares about

     delightedly, taking in the prehistoric splendor of the cave.

     His eyes light up at the sight of the BATMOBILE, parked on its

     little plateau.

                               PENGUIN (cont.)

               So Bruce equals Batman.  It seems I've

               discovered 

two

 treasures!

(an evil smile)

               Don't move.  I'd be only too happy to

               shoot you both.

     He pulls out his packet of photos and begins to scan the cave.

     He spots the distinctive ROCK FORMATION in an upper vault of

     the cavern.  It's a couple of plateaus over; a long narrow

     CATWALK runs past it, some ten or twelve feet below.

                               PENGUIN

               The Gotham City Treasury.  It's about to

               be stolen twice.

                               ALFRED

               Don't be absurd. You'll never be able to

               get it out of here.

                               PENGUIN

               Oh, I'll manage somehow.  You two are my

               guarantee of that.

(nudging VICKI with the gun)

               Let's have a look, shall we?  

You go

first

.

     He shoves her.  She starts across the catwalk, his gun at her

     head.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT

     SELINA's made it back upstairs, but she's moving at quarter-

     speed, favoring one leg and clutching her ribs as she lopes

     down the hallway.  She's just passed the balcony overlooking

     the entry hall when BATMAN appears dead ahead in her path.

     He's ready to rumble -- but instead of responding, she packs

     it in.  She stops, slumps against a wall and begins to laugh.

                               SELINA

               It could've been so nice -- you and me --

               if only you weren't so screwed up.

                               BATMAN

               It's over.  I don't want to hurt you any

               more.

                               SELINA

               Tell me something -- one thing.  If you

               don't 

enjoy

 all this...why do you do it?

     He just looks at her.  He doesn't have an especially good

     answer.  She sighs.

                               SELINA (cont.)

               I'll never understand men.

     She SPINS SUDDENLY, delivering a high-kick to BATMAN's throat.

     As he reels backward, into a wall, she leaps up onto the

     narrow BANNISTER RAILING some thirty feet above the entry hall

     floor and goes into a CROUCH -- preparing to SPRING at the

     enormous crystal CHANDELIER mounted to the ceiling --

     -- but just as she launches off, BATMAN rolls -- and brings up

     a GUN from his belt.  He fires a RAZOR-SHARP DISK which sails

     past her head, cleanly SLICING THROUGH the chain which

     suspends the chandelier.

     The chandelier FALLS just as CATWOMAN catches hold of it --

     and she finds herself PLUMMETING to the floor of the entry

     hall.  On impact, the chandelier EXPLODES into a thousand

     fragments; the CATWOMAN lands hard on her back and lies

     sprawled in the midst of the wreckage, unmoving.

     BATMAN advances slowly down the stairs.  Her arms and legs jut

     out at unnatural angles; she lets out an eerie, whimpering

     YOWL OF PAIN -- a 

cri du chat

.  He stands over her; she glares

     up at him.

                               BATMAN

               Nine lives.

                               CATWOMAN

               I can't move.  I can't move.

     Her face is cut and bleeding.  She tries to lift an arm and

     can't quite manage it.  He crouches down beside her, still

     cautious...

                               CATWOMAN (cont.)

               DON'T LOOK AT ME!!

(pleading)

               Do me, baby...do me now...that's what I

               want.  Please?

     BATMAN looks up.  DICK is standing on the balcony overlooking

     them, highly curious as to what he'll do.

                               BATMAN

               No.

     BATMAN slowly rises to his feet.  She lets out another

     gruesome WHINE.

                               CATWOMAN

               COME ON.  Don't stop now.  FINISH ME OFF.

(almost weeping with pain)

               Son of a bitch.  You're all alike...

     Her STEEL CLAWS snick into place.  With an agonizing effort

     she lifts her forearm -- bends her wrist.  She's trying to

     slit her own throat.

     He reaches for his belt, extracts a GLASSINE CAPSULE, and

     breaks it open with his thumb.  He drops it amid the shattered

     glass around her face.  A tiny cloud of GREEN GAS plumes out,

     and her hand falls limply at her side as she lapses into

     unconsciousness.

     BATMAN stands over her for a minute as DICK marches down to

     join him.

                               DICK

               You should've done it, man.  You should've

               killed her.

     BATMAN gives him a long, hard look -- but says nothing.

                               BATMAN

               There's a radio in the cave.  We'll send

               for help.

INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER

     The PENGUIN and VICKI are on a catwalk just below the ROCK

     FORMATION.  A STONE OUTCROPPING extends toward the catwalk,

     and he forces her to JUMP FOR IT.  Now he has to follow; the

     prospect makes him nervous, but it's a short hop, and he

     clears it okay -- finding his footing on the rocky slope.

     They're cautiously making their way up toward the ROCK

     FORMATION when BATMAN appears suddenly at the far end of the

     catwalk -- sizes up the situation and FREEZES IN HIS TRACKS.

                               PENGUIN

               Ah, the illustrious Mr. Wayne.  Look at

               you now.  Whatever would your friends say?

(smiling)

               You've been an exceptionally congenial

               host -- but I must ask you to 

back off

.

     The PENGUIN grabs hold of VICKI and HOLDS HER CLOSE as they

     climb the last few feet toward the grotto.  BATMAN swings his

     cape around, concealing his hands from view.  He takes a

     cautious step backward.

CLOSEUP - BATMAN'S HAND

     His free hand closes around a BATARANG -- flicks it open.

ANGLE ON ROCKS - PENGUIN AND VICKI

     They've pulled almost even with the rock formation.  A LARGE

     DANK GROTTO is visible through a small gap in the rocks.

                               PENGUIN

               No sudden moves.  It's a long way down.

     Gun at her head, he peers into the grotto...

HIS POV - INSIDE THE GROTTO

     A VAST FORTUNE in GOLD and SILVER BULLION, undisturbed in all

     these years.  GLINTING in the darkness.  Hanging upside-down,

     above it, like silent guardians, are BATS -- DOZENS of them --

     their tiny wet red eyes GLIMMERING at the PENGUIN...

     He dislodges a rock.  It tumbles into the grotto...

     ...and a startled BAT comes screeching out of the gap in the

     rocks -- FLYING DIRECTLY AT HIS FACE.

ANGLE ON ROCKS - PENGUIN AND VICKI

     He BACKS AWAY IN HORROR as the bat streaks past him.  He FIRES

     HIS GUN wildly.  The SOUND OF IT rouses MORE BATS, and they

     come flying out of the hole -- a VAST, CHITTERING SWARM.

     VICKI SHRIEKS; the PENGUIN STUMBLES -- and the two of them

     FALL BACK ONTO THE ROCKS, hanging on for dear life.

                               BATMAN

               VICKI!

     An instant later BATMAN lets fly with the BATARANG.  Clean

     hit; the PENGUIN staggers back, and his GUN skitters down

     across the rocks.

     With BATS screaming all around her, VICKI takes a deep breath

     and VAULTS toward the CATWALK.  She's a foot short; she grabs

     hold of the railing and HANGS THERE, over the ABYSS, trying to

     pull herself up.  BATMAN races toward her --

     -- but the PENGUIN, clambering down across the rocky

     outcropping, has managed to grab hold of his GUN.  The BATS

     have begun to swirl up toward the higher recesses of the

     cavern, and he's able to draw a clean bead on BATMAN.

     THUNDEROUS ECHOES reverberate through the cave as the first

     shot strikes BATMAN and knocks him backward.  As the second

     spins him around.  As the third sends him TOPPLING OVER THE

     RAILING.

     VICKI screams.  BATMAN manages to grab the rail with one hand.

     Now 

two

 of them are hanging from the catwalk -- sitting ducks

     -- and the PENGUIN is determined to empty the clip.

     The ECHOES are cacophanous.  ANCIENT STALACTITES drop from the

     vaulted roof of the cavern, PLUMMETING DOWNWARD like deadly

     projectiles, shattering agaist the cave floor.  And then --

     BATMAN pulls a tiny DEVICE from his utility belt and FLINGS

     IT.  It lands in the rocks at the PENGUIN's feet.  He stares

     down at it, and two beats later --

     -- it begins to emit an EERIE ELECTRONIC WHINE.  Within

     moments, EVERY BAT IN THE CAVE is in a FRENZY -- HOMING IN ON

     THE SIGNAL.  The PENGUIN looks up sees them coming.  A CHOKED

     WAIL emits from his throat as he drops the gun and stands

     there, PARALYZED.

He's just been beaten at his own game

.  He lets out a last

     awful HOWL as HUNDREDS OF BATS ENGULF HIM --

     -- and he PLUNGES DOWN INTO THE PIT -- his hideous scream

     dwindling to a faint echo, then vanishing altogether...

     BATMAN manages to drag himself up onto the catwalk.  He rushes

     over to VICKI, pulls her up, drapes his cape around her

     protectively.  Gradually, as the BATS recede to their distant

     perches, he stands and helps VICKI to her feet.  They embrace

     on the edge of the abyss.

     On the far plateau, DICK has hooked up with ALFRED.  The

     butler is slumped against a lab table, weary and exhausted,

     clutching his wounded arm.  DICK slings an arm around him and

     helps him to the stairway.

CUT TO:

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

     SQUAD CARS everywhere.  FRICK and FRACK emerge in handcuffs,

     flanked by COPS.  PARAMEDICS carry the still-unconscious

     SELINA past on a stretcher and load her into the back of an

     ambulance.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY HALL - NIGHT

     The place is an utter mess.  Amid the carnage we find BRUCE

     conferring with COMMISSIONER GORDON and LT. BULLOCK.  In b.g.,

     a POLICE DOCTOR is dressing ALFRED's gunshot wound.

                               GORDON

               ...and then Batman showed up?

                               BRUCE

               He saved all our lives, Jim.  I can't say

               for sure, but I'd bet 

she's

 the one behind

               the murders.

                               GORDON

               God -- I pray you're right.

(beat)

               One thing before we go, Bruce.  Who's the

               kid?

     BRUCE looks into the front parlor, where VICKI and DICK are

     righting the fallen Christmas tree.

                               BRUCE

               Oh, that's Vicki's little cousin.  He's in

               town for the holidays.

                               GORDON

               Well, he picked a hell of a time to visit.

(turning to go)

               Merry Christmas, Bruce.  Good luck

               cleaning this place up.

     GORDON and BULLOCK file out, followed by the POLICE DOCTOR.

     BRUCE smiles wearily to himself and strolls into the front

     parlor.

INT. FRONT PARLOR - NIGHT

     ALFRED loads 'SILENT NIGHT' on the CD.  VICKI ambles up to

     BRUCE:

                               VICKI

               What are you going to do with all that

               gold?

                               BRUCE

               I dunno.  Might be a good start on a place

               to live -- for some people who don't have

               one.

     She hugs him.  DICK plugs in the Christmas-tree lights; they

     blink to life just as the GRANDFATHER CLOCK strikes twelve.

                               VICKI

               It's Christmas.

                               BRUCE

               Yeah.  Maybe you should -- open your

               present.

     She runs a hand along his cheek and laughs softly.

                               VICKI

               Oh, Bruce, presents doesn't matter.  None

               of it matters.  We're all safe.  We're

               together.

                               BRUCE

               ...You might as well.

     He digs around in his jacket pocket and produces a tiny GIFT

     BOX, which he hands to VICKI.  She unwraps it, opens it slowly

     -- and sees a DIAMOND RING inside.

     She gazes up at him, speechless.  He gazes back.

     CAMERA PULLS UP and away until we can see the whole of the

     devastated room, and all the people in it -- VICKI, falling

     into BRUCE's arms; DICK, off to one side, watching them;

     ALFRED, tossing broken furniture into a roaring fireplace.

     And on the image of this decidedly eccentric family unit, we

FADE OUT.

THE END
