    SPACE

    Distant STARS, with vast tracts of darkness stretching

    between them. Move in on OUR SUN, dwarfed in the immense

    cosmic ocean.

                    MUMBLE (VO)

          You ever feel small?

    Moving in on....

    PLANET EARTH

    The spinning blue marble.

    FADE IN: A strange cacophony of MUSIC, growing louder as the

    familiar CONTINENTS revolve below us and we spiral down onto

    ANTARCTICA

    THE ICE SHELF

    Vast, pristine, stupendous. Washed with dawn light. A few

    small BLACK-SUITED FIGURES are moving towards us.

                    MUMBLE (VO)

          Like you're no-one, cos the world is full

          of us, and everyone's the same

    Wait a minute. These aren't humans... they are PENGUINS!

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)

          How do you stand out from the crowd?

          How do you find someone special?

    A GREAT COMMUNITY

    EMPEROR PENGUINS all over the place, Its chaos - Grand

    central station - with everyone SINGING to each other.

                    MUMBLE (VO)

          I know. I know. "You sing your heart

          out." That's how mum found dad in the

          first place

    Follow a female penguin as she waddles through the massive

    crowd past an assortment of crooning males

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                             2.

CONTINUED:

                         KEEN MALE

                 (trying to connect)

             "Babe...I got you Babe..."

She ignores him

                       NEXT MALE

                 (giving it his all)

             "When a man loves a woman..."

She keeps moving, until she sees the male of her dreams:

                       WISHFUL

             "Love me tender love me true, all my

             dreams fulfil.

He stands a bit apart from the rest. And what a voice. What a

hip movement. She sings along.

                       NORMA J. AND WISHFUL

             ...for my darling I love you and I always

             will.

                       MUMBLE (VO)

             With them it was love at first song.

Close up on the two penguins as their necks intertwine.

                       MUMBLE (VO) (CONT'D)

             But with me everything was a different,

             right from the moment I was born

THE ICE SHELF

With infinite care, THE EGG is passed from Norma J's feet

onto WISHFUL's.

                       MUMBLE

             First rule of survival: get yourself laid

             before winter.

WISHFUL covers the egg, glancing up at the darkening sky

                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)

             Apparently I only just made it.

Women are leaving and heading off over the ice. The community

resounds with sad songs of parting.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                           3.

                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)

             Afterwards Mum went off to the sea to

             keep warm. Dad stayed home like dad's do,

             incubating.

Norma J is having difficulty tearing herself away. Finally

she pads off after the others.

                       WISHFUL

             Safe home baby....

As he watches her dwindle into the distance, where huge STORM

CLOUDS are building.

                       WISHFUL (CONT'D)

             I'll miss you.

THE DARKNESS

Wind comes shreiking across the ice shelf to where THOUSANDS

OF MALES are huddled, ice crusting on their feathers.

                       MUMBLE (VO)

             Tell me what it is about the cold and the

             dark. Soon as the sun goes away, everyone

             gets religious

The huddled penguins are engaged in ritual chanting

                       LEAD VOICE

             When all others leave...

                          CHORUS

             We Remain.

                       LEAD VOICE

             When the Sun vanishes...

                          CHORUS

             We Remain.

INSIDE THE HUDDLE

The adult males are packed shoulder to shoulder, looking

downwards at the eggs balanced on their feet.

CU on the Lead male, a CARUSO

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                              4.

CONTINUED:

                       CARUSO

             Deny the pangs of hunger.

             Seal the gaps. Share the warmth....

                       MUMBLE (VO)

             Caruso's the leader because he's so

             incredibly old. Some say more than 40,

             but you know how penguins exaggerate.

OUTSIDE

WINDWARD PENGUINS peel off and walk around to the leeward

side. WISHFUL is among them

                       CARUSO

             ....Each one taking his turn to defy the

             wind.

WIDE SHOT

The MASSED VOICES rise above the gale, the frosty plumes of

their breath forming a shared `thought bubble'...a benevolent

UBERPENGUIN.

                       CARUSO.

             ...As we invoke the Great One, Penguin of

             Penguins

                       WISHFUL

                 (pushing back inside)

             OK. Invoke. But keep moving

                       MUMBLE (VO)

             My dad was never that devout. Often his

             mind was on other stuff.

As the chanting builds, a little thought-bubble appears next

to the communal imagination: An image of Norma J

                       NORMA J.

                 (Sings)

             "I wanna be loved by you, alone and

             nobody else by you boo boo pee doo"

WISHFUL raises his head, breaking the seal. A little puff of

steam escapes

                       WISHFUL

             Amen to that honey

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                            5.

CONTINUED:

                       VARIOUS PENGUINS

             Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, pal!

             Ya lettin' out the heat!

Penguins around him start jostling to close the gap

                       PENGUINS

             ...Quit shovin'!

             ...Hey watch where you're putting your

             feet

                       CARUSO

             Brothers, BROTHERS! The Devotions!

An egg rolls out of the HUDDLE and onto the ICE.

                       WISHFUL

             Oh no! I dropped it! Where's my egg!

WISHFUL barges out of the huddle, retrieves the egg and

waddles back into the warmth again.

                       WISHFUL (CONT'D)

             S'okay. S'okay. No harm done.

                       MUMBLE (VO)

             I guess he was wrong about a lot of

             things.

Pulling back, till the powerful rhythmic chanting is drowned

out by the HOWLING GALE.

                       WISHFUL

             But I did learnt this from him:    the

             power of positive thinking

We are moving in again, towards the huddle, the voices of the

Great Male Gathering begin to cut through the wind blasts.

Louder and louder, until...

                       ELDER

             By the power of our Devotions...

                       ALL PENGUINS

             We turn the world once more.

                       ELDER

             By our devotion to the Wisdoms

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                          6.

CONTINUED: (2)

                    ALL PENGUINS

          We bring back the sun.

The CHANTING crescendos, awe-inspiring, as it rises above the

sound of the gale, and, as if in response

THE EARTH TURNS!

The CURTAIN OF DARKNESS which overshadows Antarctica begins

to LIFT from the curvature of the southern hemisphere. The

vast ice-continent is BRILLIANTLY ILLUMINATED once more.

ON THE ICE SHELF

The ICE itself is moaning and groaning, like a living thing.

A SINGLE CRACK appears and widens, then forks and forks

again.

The whole expanse of fast-ice is DISINTEGRATING, starting at

the sea-ice and progressing towards the ice-cliffs.

Somewhere an ICEBERG breaks free from the face of a glacier

and smashes down into the frozen sea below. At the same

time...

THE EMPEROR COMMUNITY

An EGG cracks open, then another, then all in a rush, like

POPCORN.

Fathers are calling out to each other as their fluffy CHICKS

emerge to greet the daylight.

                          EXCITED FATHERS

          ...It's   a   boy!

          ...It's   a   girl!

          ...What   a   peach!

          ...What   a   bruiser!

Amongst the excited crowd of males and hatchlings we find

WISHFUL staring down at his egg still balanced on his feet.

                    FRIENDLY PENGUIN

          Late opener, huh? You thinks its alive?

                    WISHFUL

          I'll say. Listen...

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                              7.

CONTINUED:

He taps the egg with his beak. Bending close they hear a

TAPPING SOUND in REPLY.

                       FRIENDLY PENGUIN

             Well, how about that?

WISHFUL taps again. The tapping comes back louder. A TINY

FOOT pops out of the egg. Then ANOTHER. The Egg flips and

lurches off in a giddy DANCE.

                       WISHFUL

             Whoa li'l buddy, slow down!

THE FRIENDLY PENGUIN'S chick giggles at the DANCING EGG,

which finally trips and cracks, depositing baby MUMBLE.

                       MUMBLE

                 (hopping from one foot to the

                  other)

             Ow! Freezy, Fuh-Fuh-Freeezy! All Freezy!

                       OTHER PENGUINS

             ...Jees!

             ...You ever see a chick move like that

             before?

             ...is he damaged?

             ...is he deranged?

They gather round staring down at this strange little jigging

ball of fluff

                       WISHFUL

             What? Come on. He'll grow out of it.

Shovelling MUMBLE off the ice and into his BROOD POUCH.

                       WISHFUL (CONT'D)

             Come here, li'l Mumble. Let's get you

             warm and toasty.

Mumble SNUGGLES contentedly between his father's legs,

surveying his new world. The friend's chick, ELLA is staring

at him fascinated

                       ELLA

             Get him to do it again Daddy

                          FRIENDLY PENGUIN

             Shh. Quiet

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                            8.

CONTINUED: (2)

She disappears under his brood pouch

                    MUMBLE

              (looks up)

          So What happens now, Dad?

                    WISHFUL

          We Wait

THE ICE

A LONG LINE of male penguins, thousands of them, all with

their chicks, stand staring expectantly across the ice shelf.

At the front, we find WISHFUL and MUMBLE, who is jiggling

with anticipation, hopping from one foot to the other.

                    MUMBLE

          Is she coming soon?

                    WISHFUL

          Any day now.

                    MUMBLE

          Tell me again what she's like

                    WISHFUL

              (sings)

          a wiggle when she walks, a giggle when

          she talks, makes my world go round....

MUMBLE does a little SOFT SHOE SHUFFLE.

                    WISHFUL (CONT'D)

              (sharply)

          Hey. Thought I told you not to do that

                    MUMBLE

          Sorry. When I get happy my feet get happy

          too.

                    WISHFUL

          Well tell em don't.

                    MUMBLE

          But Why Dad?

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                            9.

CONTINUED:

Caruso waddles past: A stern glance down at little Mumble as

he carries on along the line

                       WISHFUL

             `Cos it ain't penguin.

LATER

MIST rises off the ice shelf. The males are still waiting

with their chicks. Over this: The sound of Chicks crying.

MUMBLE between his father's feet, follows his father's

concentrated gaze.

                       MUMBLE

             Gee I'm hungry

                       WISHFUL

             Everyone's hungry son. The mommas are

             bringing fish soon.

Long pause

                       MUMBLE

             What's fish look like.

                       WISHFUL

             You'll see it when she brings one

STILL LATER

The baby penguins are HOWLING now.

Anxious fathers lean forward, peering into the distance.

Out of the thickening mist, a cluster of little BLACK DOTS

materialises.

                         PENGUIN LOOKOUTS

             ...Wives-ho! Wives-ho!

             ...Hubba-hubba! Wives-ho!

             ...Better late than never.

The distant females look exhausted as they totter unsteadily

across the ice towards their partners. The MALES break ranks

and rush towards the distressed females.

                         MALE PENGUINS

             ...Barbra-Ann!

             ...Peggy Sue!

A tumult of re-unions as partners find each other. But no

luck for WISHFUL.

                           WISHFUL

             NORMA J.?!

Weaving anxiously through the throng, overhearing:

                       MALE#1

             You're not as fat as I thought you'd be.

                       FEMALE#1

             It was pretty slim pickings. Something's

             happened I tell you

                       FEMALE#2

             Even the squid were hard to get

             We had to swim forever

                       FEMALE#3

             Everyone split up. A lot of the gals

             never made it back.

                         MALE #3

             ...Gloria?! Gloria??!

WISHFUL, is running frantically through the crowd, singing

all the time in the hope of being recogniosed

                       WISHFUL

             Since my baby left me. I found a new

             place to dwell.

             Down the bottom of lonely street at

             heartbreak hotel

MUMBLE hippity-hops after his father, trying to keep up...

                       WISHFUL (CONT'D)

             Woah I'm so lonely baby. I'm so lonely

             baby. I'm so lonely I could...

Moving beyond the crowd, WISHFUL sees a last few stragglers.

Amongst them...

Over WISHFUL' shoulder, she sees the infant Mumble HIPPITY-

HOPPING towards them.

          But who's this.

          I called him Mumble.

Mumbles feet start to tap involuntarily, Then he catches his

dad's warning look.

                    MUMBLE

          Did she get one. Did she bring one back.

                    NORMA J

          Just a little krill that's all

                    MUMBLE

          Can I see it?

                    WISHFUL

          Later, bud. Give your ma time to

          regurgitate

                    NORMA J

          Aw. But isn't he just a darling?

                    MUMBLE

              (yells ecstatically)

          I got one! I got a mum everyone. I got a

          MUM!!

                                                             12.

THE GREAT COMMUTE

The ICE-SHELF is as busy as a freeway at peak hour with males

and females are hurrying BACK AND FORTH from the sea.

                       MUMBLE (VO)

             After that, with food being so scarce

             everyone was busy busy busy. Mom and dad

             were working so hard I didn't see much of

             them. Besides I had school to go to.

THE CRECHE

An efficient, caring TEACHER is giving a lesson to a class of

about thirty young chicks grouped in front of her.

                       TEACHER

             Settle class. Settle. We will begin with

             the most important lesson you will ever

             learn. Now does anyone know what that is?

MANY flippers go up.

                        TEACHER (CONT'D)

             Michael?

                       MICK

             Don't eat yellow snow?

                       TEACHER

             True but, that's not it. Mumble?

                       MUMBLE

             Swimming? Catching Food?

                       TEACHER

             Anyone else?

Mumble looks astonished. What's more important than that

                       ELLA

             It's our Heartsong, Miss.

                       TEACHER

             Your Heartsong. Yes. The melody you hear

             inside, the thing that makes you

             different from every other penguin. So.

             Let's all be very still now and listen.

             And when you hear your song, let it come

             out. Who's first.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                       TEACHER

             Well Michael, if you think that's really

             you. What have you got for us, Ella?

                       ELLA

                 (sings)

             Voulez-vous coucher avec moi...ce soir?

                       MUMBLE

                 (laughs)

             That doesn't make any sense.

                       TEACHER

             Well Mumble...perhaps you can do better

                       MUMBLE

             Mine is more sort of a...

He hesitates, as if listening to something in his head.Then,

he sings UTTERLY TUNELESS, like a drum solo.

                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)

             Bim bam-a-loolah a bim bam bom

                       TEACHER

             You heard that in there?

Mumble is still going. TITTERS and SNIGGERS from the class.

                       MUMBLE

             You like it?

                       TEACHER

             Dear, that's not even a tune.

                         MUMBLE

             It's not?

                       TEACHER

             No, a tune is like...

                 (she sings a scale)

             La la la la la la la la.

                    MUMBLE

          Oh, La la la la la

A croaky monotone.   The class LAUGHS OPENLY.

                     TEACHER

              (getting worried)

          Listen carefully, Mumble. La la la la la

          la la la!!

The class fall about in HYSTERICS.

                    MUMBLE (VO) (CONT'D)

          Whats funny?

              (genuinely perplexed)

          What's funny?

LATER

MUMBLE's PARENTS are talking to the TEACHER.

                    TEACHER

              (sotto)

          It's bizarre. I don't understand it. Did

          anything happen - you know...- during early

          development?

                    NORMA J.

          No. All fine. Normal incubation, wasn't

          it honey?

Wishful shuffles guiltily.

                       WISHFUL

          Well Yeah, it was a kinda...a tough winter

          I guess, and he did hatch a little late,

          but...

                 (at a loss.)

          Is there really nothing we can do?

                       TEACHER

             Of course there is. Thats why we have

             Mrs Astrakhan.

MRS ASTRAKHAN'S

Some distance from the creche, MUMBLE stands with MRS

ASTRAKHAN, a Russian-accented remedial teacher.

                       MRS ASTRKHAN

             CAN'T SINK? Rubbeesh. Every little

             pengvin has a sonk. Vhen I have

             feenished, your singink vill be givink

             everyone the goosepeempel.

CU on MUMBLE looking up.

                       MRS ASTRAKHAN

             So. Closink the eyes. Liftink chin. Deep

             breathe here in the downbelow. Now...most

             important part, find a feelink. Happy

             feelink, sad feelink, maybe lonely

             feelink.

MUMBLE closes his eyes.

                            MRS ASTRAKHAN (CONT'D)

             So?...So?...

                       MUMBLE

             I'm thinking.

                       MRS ASTRAKHAN

             Don't think EET!! Feel eet!

             Through the whole body, from the beak

             right down to tippy-toes.

Her voice is seductive, hypnotic.

                       MRS ASTRAKHAN (CONT'D)

             And then slowly, very slowly...

She hears a strange TAPPING sound and looks down.

                       MRS ASTRAKHAN (CONT'D)

             Vhat? Vhat is this?

                            MUMBLE

             What?

             The feet. The jiggy-jog. Don't do eet. Do

             not move muscle.

             Rigid like plank, like board. NO

             MOVINK!!!

             Now...calm. Remember the feelink.

                         MUMBLE

             Feelink...ok.

                       MRS ASTRAKHAN

             And be spontanuous.

Once again his feet start twitching uncontrollably.

                       MRS ASTRAKHAN (CONT'D)

             No! Stop! No jiggy-jog!

                       MUMBLE

             I'm being spontanuous.

                       MRS ASTRAKHAN

             Not with the feet, with the sonk!

             You vant to meet beautiful girl?

             You vant to make the Egg?

                        MUMBLE

             Oh yes.

                       MRS ASTRAKHAN

             Well singk! "Ba Ba Bleckship,

                       MUMBLE

                 (totally unmusical)

             "Twinkle, twinkle, little star. How I..."

                       MRS ASTRAKHAN

             Hokay. Enough. Stop. Hokay! Ve go back to

             the top. Forget the body, look inside the

             soul. No notes, no sonk, only feelink.

             Happy feelink. Sad feelink. Enormous

             feelink, so enormous it fills the whole

             body. It must escape or you explode! Now,

             open your leetle beak...

Mumble opens his beak, inspired.

                       MRS ASTRAKHAN (CONT'D)

             Yes, yes, lift up the head! That's it!

Mumble inhales, his eyes are shining, his body is shaking.

                    MRS ASTRAKHAN (CONT'D)

          You take a big breath, good and...now! Now!

He's off again, DANCING LIKE A FOOL...wild, exuberant, totally

uninhibited and unselfconscious.

After some time, he remembers himself, stops and turns to the

Mrs Astrakhan who is BANGING HER HEAD against a lump of ice.

                    MRS ASTRAKHAN (CONT'D)

          Disaster! Catastroff! I never fail!

          Never!

THE ICE SHELF

Follow Mumble as he wanders alone, back towards his class.

He stops some distance away, listening to the other kids who

are now performing with increasing virtuosity.

Ella is among them, her clear high voice borne to him on the

wind.

Mumble sighs and his little shoulders sink, no way he'll ever

be able to sing like that.

                    MUMBLE

          Its tough when you realise you'll never

          fit in. Plus I was beginning to moult

A piece of downy fluff is peeling off one wing

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)

          I couldn't face the class in this mood So

          I just kept going.

Music over: Walk on By as he wanders through the vast colony

head down against the wind, little feet padding over the ice,

Gradually the colony begins to thin.

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)

          Looking for what? I don't know? A

          different type of penguin?

The noise of the colony has faded behind him. He stops and

looks up.

                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)

             And that's exactly what I found.

THE EDGE

Before him, a wasteland of discoloured ice covered with

broken eggs and bits of feather. There are very few penguins

here and the ones he can see are all, frankly, weird.

A Penguin walks in an endless figure of eight muttering to

himself. Another has his flippers wrapped tightly around

himself like a straightjacket. A troubled Penguin sings

angrily..."There's no business like show business.

CU on Mumble. As he looks back to the sanctuary of the colony

and then back out over the wasteland

                       MUMBLE

             Not the nicest place in the world but at

             least you could do what you liked here.

Fade in Music: (I'm Free by the Who) and Mumble is off,

skittering over the rubbish strewn ice, little feet dancing

to his hearts content until....

a shadow passes over him and

Whump! a huge SKUA BIRD, twice Mumbles size, with a cruel

flesh-eating beak, lands on the ice right on front of him.

                       SKUA

             Hey, whacha doin' dere flipperbird?

                       MUMBLE

             Me? Oh, nothing. What are you doing?

THREE MORE SKUAS descend. MUMBLE is surrounded.

                       SKUA#1

             Oh we just dropped in for a spota lunch.

             Leg or wing?

Their dark eyes fix on Mumble. He is starting to feel uneasy

and backs away.

                       MUMBLE

             But ...but. I'm a penguin.

                        SKUA#1

The FIRST SKUA moves in on MUMBLE.

                       FIRST SKUA

             And dis time I'm getting the juicy bits.

                       MUMBLE

             I don't have juicy bits! Look...

             all bone and feather! Feel for yourself.

They fall over each other, fighting to take up Mumble's

invitation.

He does a wild little TAPDANCE hoping to distract them.

                       FIRST SKUA

                 (unimpressed)

             Nope.

          Ok boys, for once we gonna do dis

          civilised. Now...

The FIRST SKUA opens his beak to strike. Mumble has noticed a

YELLOW PLASTIC BAND around the Skua's leg.

                    MUMBLE

          Hey! What's that on your leg?

The FIRST SKUA halts his attack.

                    FIRST SKUA

          Interesting you should ask?

                    OTHER SKUAS

          No! No! Don't startim on that!

wing.

                    MUMBLE

          At least those aliens didn't eat you.

                    FIRST SKUA

          True. I guess my cries for mercy appealed

          to their better nature.

                    MUMBLE

          So - You think I could appeal to your

          better nature?

          Nice try kid. But No...

He opens his beak wide as MUMBLE stumbles backwards and falls

into a narrow CREVICE in the ice.

             Hey! Whatcha think ya doin' down dere

The other Skuas move in to help. MUMBLE cowers in the CRACK

as they spear at him with their beaks.

             ...Come on, out witcha!

             ...Ya sneaky-ass flipperbird!

They can't get hold of him. Frustrated, they turn on the

FIRST SKUA, squabbling and whacking each other with their

wings.

                         SKUAS (CONT'D)

             when I peck you know you've been

             pecked...(fade)

MUMBLE watches from the safety of the crack as they fight and

argue viciously among themselves

                       MUMBLE (VO)

             Compared with that, school almost seemed

THE CRECHE

MUMBLE stands some distance back from where the other young

penguins are taking school lessons.

                       MUMBLE (V.O.)

             Most days I hid at the back, dreaming

             about the world beyond

MUMBLE looks up at a cloud that resolves itself into the

unmistakable shape of a FISH. As he watches, the cloud morphs

into something that resembles a WHALE. Then morphs again

into...a SEAL. Then into the shape of an upright CREATURE with

bulging eyes and tentacled hands.

LATER. THE GRADUATION CEREMONY

Dozens of MATURE ADOLESCENTS...their coats almost fully moulted

to reveal the sleek, shiny black and white feathers

underneath.

They stand in a group talking excitedly until the lead

penguin, Caruso, walks up and everyone falls silent

                       CARUSO

             Graduates, today you leave the safety of

             our community for the first time,

             forsaking the trusted solid ice for the

             terrible magic of the deep.

                       MUMBLE (VO)

             Caruso. He couldn't help himself.

                       CARUSO.

             Things are not as they were. For five

             years now we have known nothing but

             famine. But you are our hope. Upon your

             survival depends the very future of the

             entire Penguin Nation. Dive deep, swim

             far. May the Great Penguinus go with you.

             And remember...

With solemn gravity, CARUSO throws his flippers into the air

and shouts.

                       CARUSO

             Excelsi-yah! Yah yah yah!

AWAY FROM THE CRECHE

Follow Mumble as he returns to his parents. In his adult

plumage he's distinguishable by a small birthmark, like a

bowtie on his chest and a small tuft of down on his head

which has not yet moulted off.

          Dad? I'll learn to sing later. I'll find

          my voice out there. In the deep. Truly.

Glancing round he sees the class moves off en masse across

the ice...heading for the sea.

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)

          Dad. Pul-eeeze.

Wishful leans forwards, pulls off Mumbles tuft with his beak.

                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)

He races off, Norma J calling after him:

          Remember `Stranger Danger'! Never talk to

Mumble turns to wave, falls over, gets up and races on after

the others with his strange hippity-hop little gait.

THE HIGHWAY TO THE SEA

A high shot reveals the miles of frozen ice that the

GRADUATES have to cover to get to the sea.

Some are shuffling along on their feet; others are

tobogganing.

A long way behind them we see the lone figure of MUMBLE

racing to catch up.

AT THE EDGE OF THE ICE

The juvenile penguins stand in a bunch, peering down looking

for somewhere to dive in.

                         GRADUATE PENGUINS

             ...What do you think, here?

             ...Are you kidding?

             ...How about over here then?

They shuffle off in a group to a nearby spot.

                         GRADUATE

             ...That last place looked better.

                        OTHERS

             ..I agree.

             ..Much better.

They all shuffle back to the previous spot and stand there,

frozen by indecision

                       GRADUATE

             ...then again....

Suddenly the little dark figure of MUMBLE barrels through the

pack, yelling

                       MUMBLE

             Outta my way flipperbirds! Coming

             through!!

For a long moment he's airborne.

Then...he hits the water with a strangled squawk!...and

disappears.

                         GRADUATES

             ...What was that?

                        ELLA

             Mumble?

They tentatively crane over the edge. No sign of him. They

peer into the water.

                       GRADUATE

             ...Lunatic!

             ...where did he go?

             ...See any blood?

Then...MUMBLE shoots out of the water like a missile...

                         MUMBLE

             Whatcha waiting for? It's

             fantast...(splosh)

... as he falls back under water again.

                       ELLA

              Go Mumble!

Without hesitation ELLA follows him.

The others follow ELLA. A few at first, then all of them en

masse leap yelling and hollering.

SURFACE/ UNDERWATER

The penguins flounder around, flapping, laughing, and choking

                       MUMBLE

             I had an instinct I'd be good at this.

             Actually we all were. We were the best.

                                                             27.

UNDERWATER

Transformed into creatures of grace and exuberance, they

swoop and dive trailing plumes of bubbles.

Over this: the music of THE BEACH BOYS.

                        BEACH BOYS

             "Suntanned bodies and the waves of

             coastline.

             In the warmed up weather, let's get

             together and do it again..."

Two PENGUINS shoot up through HOLES IN THE ICE...

THE SURFACE

Skidding out of control, they COLLIDE, ending up in a

breathless heap on top of each other.

                         ELLA

             Mumble?

                         MUMBLE

             Ella?

They scramble to their feet...but the ice is slippery.They

clutch together, slipping and sliding.

                         ELLA

             Woah!

                       MUMBLE

             I've got you! No I don't.

Leaning against each other, they manage to stand up, close

now, eyes meeting.

                         MUMBLE (CONT'D)

             Yes I do.

A brief moment then.

                         MALE PENGUIN

As others pop up all around

                         MALE PENGUINS

             ...Ella!

             ...Where da get to?

             ...there you are!

Laughing, she dives into the water. The young males follow

her. MUMBLE hippity-hops to the edge and tumbles in after

her.

UNDERWATER

A half dozen of them gambolling together, their bubble trails

intertwining...

             "In the warmed up weather, let's get

Then everyone freezes as a few silvery FISH swim past.

                         MUMBLE

             ...FISH!!

They all zero in.

Collisions, barging, a bit like water polo when the ball is

first thrown in. In an instant...all the fish are taken.

ON THE SURFACE

MUMBLE surfaces with a fish in his beak

                       MUMBLE

                       MALE PENGUIN

             Why don't I have it

Suddenly, A SKUA BIRD swoops down and grabs it.

                       ELLA

             Hey! That's a felony! Mumble, let go!

Mumble hangs on. Neither he not the Skua will let go. The

SKUA soars higher, taking MUMBLE with him.

                       ELLA (CONT'D)

                 (yells)

             Mumble!

MUMBLE is carried...higher and higher. The SKUA tries hard to

shake him off, but finally gives up.

                       SKUA

                 (derisive)

             So fly flipperbird. Fly.

He lets go the fish and MUMBLE plummets downwards, landing

Splat! on an ice floe.

ON THE ICE.

Mumble lies still

Ella and the others gather around. MUMBLE still has the FISH

firmly in his beak.

                       PENGUINS

             ...Is he breathing?

             ...he's certainly not eating

Leaning forward to take the fish

                       PENGUIN

             Take it. Really. Its for you

ELLA leans forward, takes the fish, and daintily gulps it

down.

                          ELLA

ON AN ICEBERG. NIGHT

The entire sky is ablaze with the shimmering LIGHTS of the

AURORA AUSTRALIS.

The PENGUINS stand below, looking up in wonder. They sing:

             "Gotta keep those lovin' good Vibrations

             a happenin' with her, "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh..."

             ...Mumble,

She returns to the choir. The singing resumes...a perfect

harmonic MUMBLE can't help himself. He begins to TAP DANCE.

AN ICE-FLOE

We find MUMBLE on his own small ice-floe separate from the

others on their iceberg.

As their singing drifts across to him, MUMBLE does an

exquisite little SOFT-SHOE SHUFFLE.

As night slowly pales to a misty dawn and Mumbles lonely

floe drifts off, turning slowly in the current

Music Over: "The tracks of my tears"

MORNING

He is woken by A NUDGE at his little raft of ice.

                       MUMBLE

                 (sleepily)

             Woah. Whose there.

Another nudge.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                          32.

CONTINUED:

                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)

             OK. I'm awake now. You got me

He looks around - an unfamiliar landscape of ice - then over

the side, seeing nothing but slowly spreading ripples.

A more VIOLENT NUDGE from behind almost makes him lose his

balance. A DARK SHAPE passes swiftly through the water.

                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)

             Saw you. Richard? Eddie? Ella....

The dark shape SHOOTS out of the water. Its GAPING JAWS

missing Mumble by an inch.

                         MUMBLE (CONT'D)

             ......aaarghH!

As he recoils, slips and tumbles into the WATER.

UNDERWATER/ SURFACE

Choking, thrashing and gulping air, Mumble SCRAMBLES to get

back onto the ice.

                       MUMBLE

             Everybody out!! LEOPARD SEAL!! (glub)

The murderous creature comes at him, jaws open, baring rows

of sharp TEETH and MUMBLE swims for his life.

The LEOPARD SEAL is relentless, barging through smaller

floes, powering around larger ones.

Mumble just CAN'T SHAKE HIM OFF. Desperate, he shoots up into

the air, landing on a THIN PANCAKE OF ICE that cannot support

his weight.

                         MUMBLE (CONT'D)

             HEEEELP!!

Mumble scrambles to gain purchase but FALLS BACK INTO THE

WATER. Now he is ...

UNDER THE ICE SHELF

...caught between the SOLID ICE above him and the bottomless

black WATER below.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                            33.

CONTINUED:

Mumble POWERS ahead, the ice above growing thicker, the

angled ceiling forcing him down, deeper into the BLACKNESS.

The Leopard Seal opens its mouth. Its GAPING JAWS are about

to engulf Mumble when...

a little SPECK OF LIGHT appears in the ceiling of ice. Mumble

makes a speedy sharp turn, climbing steeply.

He is in a FUNNEL OF ICE...getting narrower and narrower as it

rises to the surface. The Leopard Seal is CLOSING fast.

MUMBLE shoots THROUGH the hole in the ice and into the air...

THE ICE-SHELF

A small group of ADELIE PENGUINS recoil as MUMBLE explodes

out of the hole, closely followed by the LEOPARD SEAL.

WHAM! THUMP! They belly-flop on the ice .

                         THE ADELIES

                   (wincing)

             ...Ouch!

             ...That's gotta hurt!

             ...Who ordered seal?

Mumble is quickly on his feet and out of the Leopard Seal's

reach. The ADELIES TAUNT the bulky creature like matadors

                       THE ADELIES (CONT'D)

             ...Over here

             ...No over here. Too slow!

             ...have to lose some weight pesado

The frustrated Leopard Seal snaps and snarls impotently.

                         MUMBLE

             Yeah go chase someone your own size, ya

             big.......blubberhead.

Taunting it with a cheeky little TAP DANCE. The Adelies love

it.

                       AN ADELIE

             Hey, amigo. Do that again!

                        MUMBLE

             Do what?

                 (defensive)

              I didn't do anything.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                34.

CONTINUED:

                        AN ADELIE

             That thing with The feet.

                 (to the others)

             Hola muchachos!

             (to Mumble)

             Show them!

                          MUMBLE

             Well...I just kind of go ...like this...and

             then this...

Bolder now, he does a few neat steps.

                         THE ADELIES

             ...Oye! Ritmo Cubana!

             ...Riba Riba! Shake those hips!

             ...Yo penguino, bust a move!

They COPY HIM, improvising little riffs on his dance step.

The LEOPARD SEAL inches up behind them.

                         THE ADELIES (CONT'D)

             ...Then mebbe something like...

             ...No. I got it. Watch me!

An Adelie adds an ACROBATIC variation of his own. The LEOPARD

SEAL is almost upon them.

                       MUMBLE

             Or how about ...

MUMBLE adds a neatly executed slide just as the LEOPARD SEAL

strikes. MUMBLE avoids the lunge and the creature's face

comes down hard on the ice

                         THE ADELIES

                   (to the winded Seal)

             ...Eat my ice, lardface.

             ...Kiss my frozen toosh, rubber butt

They fall about laughing. The Leopard Seal returns to the

water.

                       LEOPARD SEAL

             I know where you live.

                         THE ADELIES

             ...Yeah, it's called The Land, tubby.

             ...Flop back anytime!

                                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                               35.

CONTINUED: (2)

Laughing hysterically at their own jokes they strut off.

MUMBLE watches them go.

                       ADELIES

             ...Hey, ain't you coming, tallboy?

             ...Or you got something better to do?

MUMBLE looks out at the endless sea of floating ice-pancakes,

all the way to the horizon. Nothing...

He shrugs and hurries off after his new friends.

FURTHER ON

A strange cacophony building as The four ADELIE AMIGOS and

MUMBLE crest the rise, to see...

ADELIE LAND

A vast, boisterous ADELIE PENGUIN COMMUNITY. Thousands of

them, stretching as far as the eye can see. Its very Rio,

very samba, worlds away from the sedate Emperor colony.

                       MUMBLE

             Wow, there are so many of you!

                         THE ADELIES

             ...Hey, this is nothin'.

             ...Used to be twice as many of us.

             ...Yeah, back when you could still catch a

             fish.

                       MUMBLE

             The shortage has affected you too?!

                       AN ADELIE

             ...Who you calling shortish?

             ...All I know is a lot of us

             ain't comin' back.

             ....And Some folks so hungry they eating

             rocks

Sure enough An ADELIE walks by, a PEBBLE in his beak.

                         THE ADELIES

                   (laughing)

             ...Eating rocks!!?

             ...That is major funny.

                                                          (CONTINUED)

                       MUMBLE

             Why funny? That's terrible

                         ADELIES

             ...Just kidding the rocks are for nest-

             building

             ...That's how its works here. The one with

             the most rocks gets the chicas.

             ..Chica boom chica boom chica boom boom

             BOOM!

                       MUMBLE

             So why aren't you guys collecting them

                         THE ADELIES

             ..Cos we got personality!.

             ...Without us the chicas got no boom boom.

             ...Without us the fiesta will be a siesta..

             ...Watch and learn tallboy.

One of the Adelies calls to a pair of YOUNG FEMALES he sees

walking by.

                         THE ADELIES (CONT'D)

             ...Hola Conchita!

The Adelies pose, RUFFLING UP THEIR CRESTS into various

styles: the MOHAWK, the FLAT-TOP...

                         THE ADELIES (CONT'D)

             ...See something you like?

...trying to top each other, they add HIPPITY-HOPS they've just

learned from Mumble. The females are intrigued.

                       A FEMALE

             Hey. Cool. Where'd you learn that?

                         THE ADELIES

             ...The big guy.

             ...He from out of town.

             ...He with us.

                       FEMALE

             Do it again.

                         THE ADELIES

             ...Sorry Show's over.

                   (To mumble as they walk off)

             ...Treat em mean and keep em keen

                    A FEMALE

              (calls after them)

          Yeah guys, in your dreams

                       THE ADELIES

          ...You see. Some penguins got it, some

          don't And the Amigos, (in unison) WE GOT

          IT!

They punch and bump each other playfully.

                      MUMBLE

          ....you think I could get some of it?

                     AN ADELIE

          Hombre, you got so much already, you

          dangerous.

He touches Mumble and recoils as if burnt

                    ADELIE

           Yow!

                    MUMBLE

          You really think so?

                      THE ADELIES

          ...You got the biggest personality of any

          of us.

          ...Except for me, maybe.

          ...Put that ego away, Ramon, you gonna hurt

          someone.

THE CONGA LINE

Music over: Carlos Santana's "Oye Como Va".

                    MUMBLE (V.O.)

          So for a while I forgot about finding a

          song altogether.

The Adelies and Mumble form a conga, weaving in and out of

the nest builders, aiming a kick here and there at their

industrious brethren

                                                          38.

UNDERWATER

                       MUMBLE

             ...We were a team

the Adelies swoop and dive, corralling a FEW SMALL FISH into

a CREVICE.

The fish, darting to and fro are suddenly confronted by

Mumble's OPEN BEAK.

ON THE ICE AGAIN

Mumble shares out the catch

AN ICEBERG

                       MUMBLE

             ...there was so much to do, so much to

             see

Mumble and the adeles come shooting down a long curving

Slippery dip

                       THE ADELIES

             ...Arriba!

             ..Addidas amigos!

As they shoot off the slippery-dip and into the sea mumble

whacks his head on the edge of the ice

UNDERWATER

The Adelies shoot back up to the surface. Mumble sinks,

slightly dazed, watching the kalaeidescope patters of the

surface recede.

Music Over: "Ground Control to major Tom"

ON THE SURFACE

                       ADELIES

             ...Where's the tall-boy

             ...I thought he was with you.

They jump back in to look for him

                                                           39.

UNDERWATER

Mumble keeps sinking, down down down into a great cathedral-

like space, lit by eerie shards of underwater light.

                        MUMBLE

             ....stuff down there beyond my wildest

             imagining.

Imbedded in the base of the glacier, the rusting remains of,

An OLD YELLOW EXCAVATOR projecting out of the glacier.

It hangs there, inscrutable, like a great yellow totem.

Mumble, dwarfed by it, contemplates it for a while, then

ventures inside, into the body of the BEAST.

INSIDE THE BULLDOZER

A rusting steering column, a perforated dashboard.

He pecks at the metal, trying to taste it, listening to the

sound it makes.

OUTSIDE THE BULLDOZER

In the shimmering space outside the bulldozer, the ADELIES

congregate.

                        THE ADELIES

             ... You sure he went in there?

             ...Mumble!

             ...Done go near it, looks like it can

             bite

One of them smims closer to the great jaws

                         ADELIES

             Ramos!

Mumble pops his head out from between the jaws

                       MUMBLE

             Oh! There you are

Terrified the Adelies scatter and shoot to the surface like

missiles.

                         MUMBLE (CONT'D)

             Guys!    I want to speak to you.

                                                         40.

THE ICE SHELF

The Adelies are heading back to their colony as fast as their

little legs will carry then. Mumble Hippity hops after them

                    ADELIES

          ...Forget it

          ...We're not going back there

          ...Never

                    MUMBLE

          But its dead. It can't hurt you

                    ADELIES

          ...Maybe its got a brother still alive.

                    MUMBLE

          But that's what we have to find out.

          Don't you see. Things like that could be

          eating the fish.

The idea is so stunningly original it stops them in their

tracks.

                    ADELIES

          Okay. Okay. Here's the plan: we go and

          ask the revered one.

                     MUMBLE

          The who?

                    THE ADELIES

          ...Reverend Loveday.

          ...The One who Knows

          ...First we gonna need stones though

                    MUMBLE

          Why stones? Wait for me

LOVEDAY'S MOUND

MUMBLE and the ADELIE AMIGOS are bunched together, near the

head of a LONG QUEUE of Adelies each with a stone or in their

beak.

At the head of this queue stands LOVEDAY - guardian of a huge

pile of pebbles. His head pokes through one of the rings a

PLASTIC SIX-PACK CAN HOLDER festooned with seaweed like a

HOLY MANTLE.

A group of Soul singers, mainly female, sway in the

background, singing a soulful song of adoration as the

Penguin ahead of Mumble steps forward.

                       LOVEDAY

             First, the devotion...

The PENGUIN adds his pebble to the pile.

LOVEDAY holds up a flipper for silence and a hush falls over

the gospel choir

                       LOVEDAY (CONT'D)

             A moment...

                 (composing himself)

                 ... and your question?

                       FIRST IN QUEUE

             Senor Loveday, My wife is one of the

             Disappeared ones Tell me is she alive?

Loveday hyperventillates, his eyes roll up in his head

                       LOVEDAY

             The Mystic Beings are speaking to me.

             Yes! She is alive and happy and you are

             in her thoughts...

                       FIRST IN QUEUE

             But is she with another male?

                       LOVEDAY

             One pebble, one question. Next!

The AMIGOS push MUMBLE forward. He is at least a head taller

than the others.

                         LOVEDAY (CONT'D)

             I sense...you are the one with the

             question.

                         ADELIE

             ...How does he do it?

             ...He just one look and he know.

Mumble places the pebble on the pile. A long Pause

                        LOVEDAY

             A little nervous? That's normal. Take

             your time.

In fact Mumble is mesmerised by the luight catching LOVEDAY's

six pack holder. He bends forwards to study it more closely

                    MUMBLE

          I was wondering. Have You ever been

          abducted by Aliens?

                    LOVEDAY

          No time wasters. Next!

                      THE ADELIES

          ...Senor! That's not his question. He's new

          here.

          something like that on his legs....

          Listen friend, this is my Sacred

          Talisman, bestowed upon me by the Mystic

          Beings...

                    MUMBLE

          Looks like they bestowed it very tight.

          So these Mystic Beings, did you see them?

                    LOVEDAY

          I hear them. They talk to me all the time

          I am their instrument. They chose me

          Did they have frontways eyes? No

          feathers? Fat flabby faces? Did they

          probe you and stick a pointy thing into

          you?

                    LOVEDAY

          Enough! How many questions is that? You

          don't have enough pebbles.

                      ADELIES IN QUEUE

          ...Yeah, one pebble, one question.

          ...We've all got stuff to ask, pal!

                    MUMBLE

          But I haven't had any answers yet!

                    LOVEDAY

          SILENCIO!! The Mystic Beings are

          speaking. They say show some respect

          stranger. Especially to the One who

          Knows.

A hush falls over the gathering.

                    LOVEDAY (CONT'D)

          The reason there are not enough fish is

          simple: There is not enough love in the

          world. Love is the answer!

One cue the gospel choir start singing: All you need is Love

                    LOVEDAY (CONT'D)

              (over this)

          Okay, everybody, turn around to the

          penguin next to you and give them a great

          big hug. Comeon, everybody...hug! This is a

          safe place.

The gathering hug awkwardly. Mumble, because of his towering

height, has trouble embracing the Adelie next to him.

                    LOVEDAY (CONT'D)

          Now. The Mating Season starts today so

          here's what everybody should do: go forth

          and multiply! If you'll excuse I myself

          must retire for a moment to the couch of

          indulgence... okay ladies, who's gonna be

          first

MUMBLE and the ADELIES are jostled aside in the STAMPEDE of

FEMALES as the gospel group break ranks and mob him

                    FEMALE ADELIES

The Adelies all start DANCING MADLY, but it is too frenetic,

too desperate.

          ...Easy as that?

THE EMPEROR COLONY

It is autumn, the EMPEROR PENGUINS for the mating season.

It is just like the GREAT GATHERING we saw at the beginning

of our story. Males and females sing their Heartsongs. And

ONE SONG stands out from all the others.

Where NORMA J. once sang, stands ELLA, now sleek and fully

mature. Gathered around her in a semi-circle, a half a dozen

adoring MALES.

                    ELLA

          Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?

          Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?

Suddenly she becomes aware of a MELLIFLUOUS MALE VOICE

overlapping hers. It has a curious bossa nova rhythm.

                    MUMBLE

          Tall and tanned and young and lovely

          The Girl from Ipanema goes walking

          And when she passes each guy she passes

          goes `Aaaah'

Ella turns to see: a PENGUIN backlit by the sun, standing

HEROICALLY on a little rise, just as WISHFUL did.

Ella recognizes those TAPPING FEET. Could this be MUMBLE?She

moves closer to investigate.

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)

          Oh, and I want her so badly

          How can I tell her I love her?

          Yes I would give my heart gladly

             But each day when she walks to the sea,

             She looks straight ahead not at me...."

                          ELLA

             Mumble?

                       SINGING VOICE

             Tall and tanned and young and lovely..

                       MUMBLE

                 (overlapping)

             Hi Ella, what do you think?

Ella, suspicious moves to one side. Mumble moves to block her

view. She moves further tound and sees:

                       THE ADELIE

             Hola bonita!

Obviously he's been singing while Mumble mimes

                       ELLA

             Mumble, that's just cheap

She turns and heads off. The Adelie starts after her.

                         THE ADELIE

             Wait up! You and me baby, we can make

             sweet music. I may be short but I'm a

             love god...Ooww!

Mumble smacks him with the back of a flipper and goes off

after Ella himself.

                       MUMBLE

             Ella. Wait!

She stops. He takes her by the shoulders Shes upset.

                          MUMBLE (CONT'D)

             I'm sorry.

                       ELLA

                 (shakes her head, tearful)

             When you left without saying goodbye I

             thought something had happened, then I

             thought he just doesn't care.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                     MUMBLE

          Don't care? I never stopped thinking

          about you.

                    ELLA

          And then when I saw you singing, for a

          second I thought...

                    MUMBLE

          I can't sing.

                    ELLA

          I know. I know. Its impossible.

She walks off.

                    MUMBLE

          But I'll show you something better

He TAPS an up-tempo, syncopated rhythm on the ice.

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)

          Sing something to this!

                    ELLA

              (her back to him)

          What's the point. It's embarrassing

                    MUMBLE

          Just try it. This once.

Ella begins to hum Never Can Say Goodbye ironically and

without conviction.

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)

          Okay, that'll work. Just keep it going.

The singing ADELIE joins in...acapella, very rhythmic

                      THE ADELIE

          "...turn around you fool

          You know I love you more and more..."

Right on cue, the rest of the AMIGOS appear on either side of

him, singing back-up.

                    THE ADELIES

          "Tell me why is it so

          Don't wanna let you go

          I never can say goodbye, no...no no no..."

Curious, ELLA TURNS.

Framed between the Adelies, Mumble strikes a pose, holds it

for a moment... then lets rip.

He TAP DANCES...UNINHIBITED, WILD, JOYOUS. The ADELIES

accompany him. They know all the moves and it is INFECTIOUS

FEET are beginning to tap, couples are beginning to

improvise... singing along, trying out the dance steps.

Now ELLA is caught up in it. AND MUMBLE IS DANCING LIKE NO

PENGUIN HAS EVER DONE BEFORE!

                    MUMBLE

          This is it Ella! This is the song inside

          me!

ELLA is ecstatic. Just when we think the WHOLE COLONY will be

swept up into the abandon. A DARK FIGURE steps forward

                        CARUSO

              (bellows)

          STOP...THIS...DEPRAVITY!!!

ELLA STOPS DANCING. MUMBLE misses a beat, loses his footing,

trips and goes sliding across the ice to the feet of CARUSO

and the ELDERS.

                    CARUSO (CONT'D)

          WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS

          ABOMINATION?!!

          It is exactly this kind of disrespectful,

          heretic behaviour that has brought the

          Scarcity upon us! Don't you see...we are

          Wait. Wait. You think it's my fault that

          there are no fish?!! Doing Happy Feet

          can't cause a food shortage.

                    AN ELDER

          ...then what did?!

                       MUMBLE

          My own opinion? I think living beyond

          the ice there are creatures we've never

          met before Aliens. Mystic Beings. Big,

          flabby......

          Guys. Can Me and Ella be alone for a bit

The Adelies give them space

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)

          OK. Here's what I'm going to do. I'm

          going to talk an alien. I'm going to find

          what's causing the shortage

                    ELLA

          But what about?...

                    MUMBLE

          Its the only way. You're right. Unless

          we have food theres no future for any of

          us - you, me the adelies, anyone

                    ELLA

          But...

                    MUMBLE

          Give me a year, just until the next great

          gathering. If I don't make it back ....at

          least I tried

                    ELLA

          But...

                    MUMBLE

          Now go back. I love you. Go.

ELLAS watches through tears as the tiny figures of Mumble and

the Adelies dwindle to specks and disappear into the mist.

THE ICE SHELF

Mumble and the Adelies have put the colony far behind,

trekking homewards

                       ADELIES

             Tell me again where we're going.

                       MUMBLE

             To find the mystic beings.

                       ADELIES

             How do we know where they live.

                       MUMBLE

             We'll ask Loveday. He's been there.

ADELIELAND

Most of the Adelies are sitting on nests. The Adeleies and

Mumble trek past them a protective mother takes a peck at

them.

                       MOTHER

             ...Not so close. We got babies on board

                       ADELIES

             ...Wow. Does nesting make em touchy

They find LOVEDAY at the back of what is left of his PEBBLE

PILE. He sits leaning against it...exhausted.

                         THE ADELIES

             ...LOVEDAY, you okay??

             ...what happened

             ...Too much boom-boom for one penguin?

MUMBLE kicks a bunch of pebbles at him.

                       MUMBLE

             Just one question! And I want a straight

             answer! Where do I find the Mystic

             Beings?

LOVEDAY tries to raise himself up. A tight low gurgling

rumbles from his throat.

                       AN ADELIE

             Why don't he speak?

LOVEDAY gurgles and points wildly to the SIX-PACK PLASTIC

round his neck.

                         AN ADELIE (CONT'D)

             Talisman...sounds like Talisman!!

LOVEDAY coughs. His eyes bulge.

                         ADELIES

             ...He's possessed!

             ...It's a seizure!

                       MUMBLE

             No. He's choking! The Talisman's gotten

             way too tight.

                         THE ADELIES

             ...Why din' you say so?

             ...Hold on we gonna take it off.

             ...You pull that side, I pull this side.

They tug at the SIX-PACK PLASTIC. LOVEDAY GASPS AND WINCES.

                       MUMBLE

             Stop. You're hurting him.

The Adelies back off.

                    AN ADELIE

          Any better?

LOVEDAY gives a little `so-so' gesture with his flipper.

                      THE ADELIES

          ...It not gonna come off.

          ...Of course it's not! It's sacred!

                    MUMBLE

          LOVEDAY, where did you get it?

                      THE ADELIES

          ...It was bestowed on him.

          ...By the Mystic Beings!

LOVEDAY shakes his head sadly.

                    MUMBLE

          They didn't bestow it on you?

                       THE ADELIES

          ...Poor Guy.

          ...He don't know what he's saying.

                    MUMBLE

          If it wasn't bestowed, what happened?

LOVEDAY mimes swimming.

                         THE ADELIES

          ...Oh, this one's easy.

          ...He swam....

          ...On his Hectic Journey of Delightenment...

          ...To the Forbidding Shore.

                    MUMBLE

          And then....?

LOVEDAY mimes the talisman going over his head.

                      AN ADELIE

          ...Well to me that's gotta be bestowing.

LOVEDAY shakes his head, `no'. He stretches his neck.

                    MUMBLE

          You looked up and...... It just got caught

          around your neck?

          ...No way. No. He's the revered one

          ...He speaking symbolically.

LOVEDAY hangs his head. A TEAR slides down his beak.

                    MUMBLE

              (gently)

          Loveday, did you ever meet a Mystic

          Being? Really?

Beaten, LOVEDAY shakes his head `No' The Adelies are stunned

into silence.

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)

          But this thing was made by someone. And

          if we find them, they could take it off.

LOVEDAY looks up, a glimmer of hope in his eye.

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)

          So where do we Go, Loveday

Loveday Then he makes a strange "Oi, Oi, Oi" sound.

                    AN ADELIE

          Oh my! Now he thinks he's an Elephant

          Seal

LOVEDAY nods and points towards the mountains.

                    AN ADELIE (CONT'D)

          He wants to go to the top of the

          mountain.

LOVEDAY shakes his head.

                       MUMBLE

          The forbidden place is over the

          mountains...

LOVEDAY nods.

                      MUMBLE (CONT'D)

          ...In the land of the Elephant Seals!!?

LOVEDAY gestures wildly with his flippers!

LOVEDAY nods `YES!!' and falls back in exhaustion.

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)

          So who's coming

                     LOVEDAY

          Oi

A MOUNTAIN RIDGE

The Adelies labour uphill into the wind. LOVEDAY is lagging

behind, breathing hard.

Even MUMBLE and the AMIGOS are puffing with the effort of the

climb.

Music Over: He aint heavy he's my brother.

                    ADELIES

          ...Stop. Enough. We must've gone past it

          ...Past? Don't kid me. We're not even

          close.

Then on the wind comes a fiant `Oi, Oi, Oi'.

                    MUMBLE

          Hear that?!

As they crest the peak, sure enough, down below: the LAND of

the ELEPHANT SEALS. Thousands of them.

                        THE ADELIES

          ...Refresh my memory do elephant seals eat

          penguin?

          ...No, no...jus' krill and fish.

          ...Sure of your facts are you?

Not waiting, Mumble launches himself over the other side,

slip-sliding down the mountain. One by one the ADELIES

follow.

                    ADELIES

          Well I guess we're about to find out

THE LAND OF THE ELEPHANT SEALS

The beach is literally heaving.

MUMBLE and the ADELIES come tumbling and sliding right up to

two HUGE SEALS.

             Well roll me over and call me a dugong.

             What the heck have we got here

The Adelies bunch up behind Mumble

                       MUMBLE

             Excuse me, we need directions...to the

             Forbidden Shore.

                       ELEPHANT SEAL 2

             Sure. Just git yourselves over them there

             hills I'd come with you myself but...

                       ELEPHANT SEAL 1

             Woah Woah. You aint told em half of it:

             over them hills, beyond the great

             glacier, `n' through the blizzard

             country.

The Good Ole Boys are into ONE-UPMANSHIP.

                       ELEPHANT SEAL 1 (CONT'D)

             Anyhow. Its its forbidden to go there.

                       ELEPHANT SEAL 2

             I heard its forbidden to ask how to get

             there!

                       MUMBLE

             We're looking for the Mystic Beings

                       MUMBLE

             Aliens, the ones who made this.

He indicates the SIX-PACK PLASTIC around LOVEDAY'S neck.

SEAL 1 lowers it's massive head down to face LOVEDAY.

Wheezing he examines the plastic with first with one eye,

then the other, before announcing his verdict.

                       ELEPHANT SEAL 1

             Blizzard Walkers!

          Could they be taking our fish?

                    ELEPHANT SEAL 1

          Could be!? I heard they'd take a whole

          penguin, rip its skin right off and turn

          it into mush.

                    ELEPHANT SEAL 2

          Huh! That's a Picnic! I hear tell they'd

          take a baby seal and club it to death.

          With their bare clubs.

                    ELEPHANT SEAL 1

          Huh! Clubbing's a Clambake! My Granpappy

          says they been known to skin a seal from

          snout to tail in a hot second.

          They don't know. They've never been there

                      AN ADELIE

          Stop! I'm hearing voices. The mystical

          guys. They say:

          "Your life is perfectly good as it

          is...forget this stupid mission".

MUMBLE and LOVEDAY keep trekking.

                    ANOTHER ADELIE

          Ramon. That was embarrassing, man.

And reluctantly, he trails after them. As do...

                      THE OTHER ADELIES

          ...Oh no, don' do this to us.

          ...I'm a lover not a fighter

          ...The first sign of Popsicles or funfood

          of any kind, I turn round and go back

THE BLIZZARD COUNTRY

MUMBLE, LOVEDAY and the ADELIES are tiny specks, struggling

over a series of great ridges.

                    MUMBLE

          So we walked ... and walked .. and kept

          walking. Over the hills and into Blizzard

          country

A SNOW STORM breakes over them. A screaming wind brings total

WHITE-OUT. The Penguins have to shout to make themselves

heard.

                      THE ADELIES

          ...Oh man! This is no place for a penguin!

          ...We should be migrating out to sea by

          now!

             Huddle??!

             Form a moving circle! Share the cold,

             share the warmth!

He turns his back to the wind. Immediately the Adelies form a

STRAIGHT LINE down-wind from him.

                         THE ADELIES

             ...Oh yeah, nice.

             ...That's definitely better.

             ...Good call big guy.

                       MUMBLE

             I said a circle!

They form a little huddle, but as soon as Mumble moves from

the upwind position, the Adelies complain.

                         AN ADELIE

             ...No, no. This can't be right!

             ...It was better the other way.

They scurry back into a straight line behind Mumble who cops

the FULL BLAST of the GALE.

He gives up and marches off into the driving snow.

                         THE ADELIES

             ...Hey!

             ...What happened to the Huddle?!

The others lie down, propelling themselves forwards on their

fronts

          ...just keep moving or you'll get my beak

          up your butt

FLARE OUT TO WHITE

The blizzard has passed. An eerie stillness.

One by one the Adelies get to their feet and waddle forwards

to where Mumble and Loveday stand, gazing into the distance.

They have finally reached the sea again

                    MUMBLE

          You think this is it? The Forbidden

          Shore?

LOVEDAY chokes out a `yes'.

                    ADELIES

          ....The way I feel": the "frostbitten"

          shore

          ....So what are those black things?.

Close to the waters edge, the outline of several buildings

AN ABANDONED WHALING STATION

The PENGUINS venture through it, dwarfed by the old flensing-

sheds, the chimneys and boiling-vats. Its all now abandoned,

and half concealed by snow.

Around and above them, there are HOOKS, CHAINS, rusting

twisted METALWORK.

                    MUMBLE

          Hello?! Is there anyone out there?

An ominous GROANING as some rusting metal plate moves in the

wind.

                     MUMBLE (CONT'D)

          Hello!!

                      THE ADELIES

          ...No need to shout.

          ...Yeah, somebody might hear you.

          ...I think we seen all there is to see

          round here.

LOVEDAY is looking at something at his feet.

                       MUMBLE

             What is it?

There, imbedded in the ice: another six pack holder.

THE SEA ICE

Mumble and the Adelies venture out onto the weak ice beyond

the whaling station, finding more and more of the strange

artefacts: a piece of nylon rope, a soda can, a boot.

                       MUMBLE

             They must be here somewhere.

             They wouldn't leave all this stuff lying

             around.

                       AN ADELIE

             Maybe they invisible.

FURTHER ON

They've reached the edge of the sea-ice. LOVEDAY croaks a

warning. He points out to sea.

                       AN ADELIE

             What is that?

A WAVE has appeared on the glassy surface of the sea. It is

coming towards them, FAST like the bow wave of an IMMENSE

UNDERWATER CREATURE.

                        MUMBLE

             A whale?

                       AN ADELIE

             As long as it's a good whale, not the

             other kind.

The wave is coming CLOSER.

                       ANOTHER ADELIE

             What other kind?!!

A massive BLACK DORSAL FIN breaks the surface.

                       MUMBLE

             The ones with teeth!!

The PENGUINS are off and running...

                                                            64.

CONTINUED:

The DORSAL FIN keeps coming like the blade of a demonic

carving knife.

Then the monstrous fin disappears and KABOOM! The killer

whale breaches the ice AHEAD of them, cutting off their

retreat.

They are left stranded on a free-floating ICE FLOE

                         THE ADELIES

             ...Jump!

             ...Swim for it!

                       MUMBLE

             No!! Stay on the ice pad where its safe

The little floe is wobbling crazily

                         THE ADELIES

             ...You call this safe amigo?

             ...Maybe we should split up.

             ...You split up I'm staying right here.

The KILLER WHALE breaches again, rising like a tower block

out of the ocean.

                       THE ADELIES (CONT'D)

             Woooaaaahhh!!

The ICE PAD flips, flinging them into the water like a

handful of peanuts.

IN THE SEA

The PENGUINS head for shore , swimming for their lives.

LOVEDAY, thrashing and wheezing, is unable to keep up.

                       MUMBLE

                 (stops)

             LOVEDAY! LOVEDAY!!

He swims back. The KILLER WHALE is about to take them both in

one bite. MUMBLE pulls LOVEDAY aside, but he's not quite

quick enough: one of the Whale's outer teeth catches LOVEDAY

by the SIX-PACK PLASTIC and he is DRAGGED AWAY, tethered to

the KILLER WHALE like Captain Ahab.

The WHALE thrashes around wildly trying to dislodge the

hapless little penguin until...

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                          65.

CONTINUED:

LOVEDAY is FLUNG high, high into the air and...SPLASHES DOWN

some distance away.

The KILLER WHALE is left with the SIX-PACK PLASTIC lodged in

its teeth.

ICE SHELF

MUMBLE and LOVEDAY scramble onto the ice exhausted.

Wondering where the next attack will come from, the AMIGOS

huddle nearby.

Suddenly the ICE SHELF CRACKS OPEN and the KILLER WHALE soars

right over the top of them

It hits the water but does not stop, just keeps going right

on out to sea. The Penguins have no time to reflect on their

good fortune.

Theres an EARTH SHATTERING NOISE behind them . Turning they

see a vast BLACK SHAPE, a hundred feet high, coming at them

through the fog.

The ADELIES flee across the ice. MUMBLE stands transfixed by

the BIG BLACK SHIP towering above him. On the deck he sees

HUMAN FIGURES...

                        MUMBLE

             Aliens?!

The pack-ice is BUCKLING AND EXPLODING ahead of the GREAT

JUGGERNAUT.

                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)

             Stop! Please!....

From a safe distance the ADELIES stop and look on in

amazement as Mumble stands his ground, shouting up at THE

SHIP as it advances towards him.

                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)

             ...It's very important!

The ICE beneath his feet OPENS UP, Mumble topples into the

gap and The SHIP PASSES OVER HIM, huge propellers churning,

leaving a channel ninety feet wide.

MUMBLE resurfaces.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                           66.

                           MUMBLE (CONT'D)

             WE...HAVE...TO...TALK!

He chases after the ship. THE ADELIES chase after Mumble...

                         THE ADELIES

             ...AMIGO-O-O-O! ...LET IT GO-O-O-O-O!!

Already the ship is half a mile away.

THE ICEBERG

Beyond the last of the ice floes is THE WORLD'S TALLEST

ICEBERG. MUMBLE hurls himself onto it and starts scrambling

up its precipitous sides. THE ADELIES follow, struggling to

keep up.

THE SUMMIT

MUMBLE's POV: THE BIG BLACK SHIP has joined TWO OTHERS about

a mile away. The Adelies join him.

                         THE ADELIES

             ...You found them, you found Aliens!

             ...Now we go back tell everybody who's

             taking the fish.

Mumble's     eyes remain fixed on the horizon.

                         THE ADELIES (CONT'D)

             ...Don't feel bad Tall Guy.

             ...They were just too fast. Too big.

             ...Too everything.

                       MUMBLE

             They've stopped!

                        LOVEDAY

             Mumble. I owe you my life amigo. And I

             say this because I

             admire and deeply respect you. If you are

             thinking what I think

             you are thinking. You are out of your

             crazy head

Mumble turns, takes a few paces back.

                       MUMBLE

             Oh. One other thing. You guys

                       ADELIES

             What?

Suddenly, MUMBLE turns to the precipice and runs as fast as

he can...

                       MUMBLE

             Excelsi yah!!!

As he launches himself into space...

WIDE SHOT

The tiny penguin soaring off the top of the ICEBERG.

THE ADELIES rush to the edge as, far below Mumble HITS THE

WATER. And vanishes.

                       THE ADELIES

             ...can you believe that

             ...brought us all this way and killed

             himself

             ...no he didn't! look!

Far out he has surfaced and is swimming strongly in direction

of the BIG BLACK SHIP.

                         THE ADELIES (CONT'D)

             ...A dive like that, and still he lives!

             ... Yeah like when he did his Happy Feet,

             his feet had wings.

             ...A normal penguin could never have done

             it.

THE OPEN SEA

MUMBLE PLOUGHS THROUGH a rolling sea: towering waves block

everything from view but on the crests he catches sight of...

THREE BLACK SHIPS, far ahead, but stationary, as if waiting

for him.

LATER

He's getting closer. The ships are only half a mile away when

Something rises from the deep, threatening to engulf him: a

HUGE NET, TEEMING WITH FISH.

Mumble shoots out of the way, just avoiding being caught as.

UP AHEAD The great NET FULL OF FISH breaks the surface of the

water and is winched on board.

                       MUMBLE

                 (yells)

             HEY! YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

             WHAT ABOUT US?!

             THE SCARCITY! THE SCARCITY!!

As if in response the ship's ENGINES START UP again and the

sea around him erupts in churning foam.

Swamped by the wake, Mumble goes under. When he resurfaces,

THE SHIP is already on its way.

                                                         (CONTINUED)

                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)

             HEY YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA GET AWAY WITH

             THIS?!! NOT IF I CAN HELP IT YOU SHIT-

             SQUIRTER ALIEN CREEPS.

He takes a deep breath and resumes his pursuit.

OPEN OCEAN

The SEAS are MOUNTAINOUS. There is no sign of the ship now,

nor of land.

MUMBLE swims up the side of each wave, over its foaming crest

and down into the deep dark valley below.

LATER

The air is full of spray. Choking, MUMBLE ducks under the

water.

UNDERWATER

Its peaceful here. Then something moves beside him and turns

with a start to see: A MASSIVE EYE!!

A BLUE WHALE entirely fills his field of vision. It sings a

few booming Wagnerian notes. Its voice is almost deafening.

                         MUMBLE

             Too loud.

He surfaces, spluttering.

                         MUMBLE (CONT'D)

             Too loud!

A VOICE calls to him from above. Mumble looks up. An

ALBATROSS hovers overhead.

                       ALBATROSS

             He's looking for a mate, mate. And these

             days, I tell you they're few and far

             between

From the ALBATROSS' aerial view, Mumble looks tiny next to

the MASSIVE BULK of the Blue Whale.

             Convergence mate.

                       MUMBLE

             The Convergence?

                       ALBATROSS

             Where the cold water meets the warm,

             mate. Once you cross it, there's no

             getting' back. What you tryinmg to prove

             anyway?

                       MUMBLE

             I'm trying to talk to the Aliens!

                        ALBATROSS

             The who?

                       MUMBLE

             On the black iceberg. The ones taking all

             the fish!

                       ALBATROSS

             Them. Fish is just the start of it Mate.

             Them aliens is the ones who took out the

             whales.

                       MUMBLE

             They kill whales! That's impossible

                       ALBATROSS

             Straight up mate. Biggest creatures ever

             lived. Decimated, mate.

                        MUMBLE

             So if I wanted to talk to them, where

             would I go

                       ALBATROSS

             Anywhere and everywhere. Over the sea,

             under the sea, Jees, I've even seen them

             fly. The great southland's swarming with

             em

                       MUMBLE

             Where's that. Do you think the Whale

             would take me there?

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                         71.

CONTINUED: (2)

The Blue Whale responds with a long mournful "NO-O-O-O" which

the Albatross does not need to translate.

                    ALBATROSS

          No way mate, he won't go anywhere near

          `em. And neither should you.

Mumble hesitates, bobbing on the water, weighing the

warnings.

He makes up his mind and strikes out again swimming towards

the convergence.

The Albatross, hovering on the wing, watches.

                    ALBATROSS (CONT'D)

          Don't say I didn't warn you

The ALBATROSS wheels away.

As MUMBLE fights on through the huge choppy waves, the

Whale's Wagnerian song booms out, EERIE and FORLORN.

THE CONVERGENCE

We see from above, the BLUE WHALE turning as well, changing

course to avoid a change in the texture and colour of the

water stretching in a line, as far as the eye can see. MUMBLE

swims RIGHT ACROSS THE LINE.

A VAST OCEAN

MUMBLE is a mere DOT now as the GREAT CURRENTS capture him

and sweep him away.

We pull back through the clouds until the very CURVATURE OF

THE EARTH is visible: a blue horizon with no land in sight.

SMALL POLLUTED BEACH

On the HIGH-WATER MARK, amongst the rubbish and the oil

slick, we see what looks like a dead animal. It is MUMBLE.

A creature in RED GUMBOOTS approaches. Its small hand reaches

down and nudges him with a stick. MUMBLE moans and the

gumboots RUN AWAY, shouting something unintelligible.

With great difficulty, Mumble raises his head to try to see

more. Sunlight flares, bleaching to white, as he LOSES

CONSCIOUSNESS.

                                                            72.

A WHITE ROOM

Scientific books and specimens of birds in large bottles on

shelves line the walls.

MUMBLE, eyes closed, is lying on a stainless steel table. He

opens his eyes to the brilliant glare of an examination lamp.

There is movement around him. Voices whispering in an alien

tongue. A FIGURE IN WHITE bends over him cleaning the oil

from his feathers with detergent. MUMBLE squawks.

                    MUMBLE (VO)

          When I finally saw one, the Alien was

          even more hideous than I'd imagined

A very pretty FEMALE SCIENTIST is smiling down at him.

                      MUMBLE (VO) (CONT'D)

          ... frontways eyes, no feathers. Big teeth

          with blood around them. Strange fleshy

          beak. A meat eater

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)

              (terrified)

          The - fish - are - ours. Understand?

But all the SCIENTIST sees is a squawking penguin.

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)

          We can't live without them!

The SCIENTIST produces a syringe and squirts some of it's

contents in the air.

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)

          Speak Adelie? Skua-talk?

Another SCIENTIST holds him still while the needle is

administered.

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)

          Oh no! Not the pointy thing!

Drowsy now, he is eased into a PADDED CAGE. The SCIENTISTS

close the lid, and secure it with straps.

IN THE CARGO HOLD

We hear a feeble thumping from inside.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

Pull back to reveal Mumble's box on a shelf among crates and

luggage. Fade in engine noise over as....

ENDLESS SKY

A 747 drones across the screen, eastwards into the night.

DARKNESS

                       MUMBLE

             I woke in darkness. Unable to move. Was I

             dead? And if I was dead, where was that

             light coming from

Like the light at the end of a tunnel. As if in a dream,

MUMBLE ambles towards it. Emerging into

PENGUIN HEAVEN

Bright BLUE SKY, sparkling WHITE CLIFFS OF ICE.

                       MUMBLE

             Wow. They brought me home

His voice ECHOES back at him, with a mocking edge. There is

something unusual about this place. A plump penguin waddles

by

                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)

             Excuse me, where are we.

                       PENGUIN

             Heaven. Where d'you think?

                       MUMBLE

             Oh. So we're dead. Right

                       PENGUIN

             Dunno. Don't care. We got food. We got

             water. You hear a seal now and then, but

             you never meet one. Perfect.

Mumble is looking around, trying to figure it out

                       PENGUIN (CONT'D)

             Fish!

                       MUMBLE

             Where?

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                            74.

CONTINUED:

A fish hits him on the head.

A moment later he's knocked flat by a sudden rush of

PENGUINS: Chinstraps, Rock-hoppers, Adelies, King penguins,

emerging from holes in the rock face

                       PENGUINS

             Fish time. Fish time!

Lying on his back he sees fish tumble from the sky. It's

RAINING FISH!

                       MUMBLE (VO)

             Every day after that, it rained fish in

             the afternoon.

His POV, Load after load of fish tumbling out of a clear sky

UNDERWATER

Fish hit the surface and sink

                       MUMBLE (V.O.)

             Fish on land and fish underwater.

Mumble pursues one of them.

                       MUMBLE

             Sometime you got a live one but there was

             nowhere really to chase it

He swims SLAP BANG into a sheet of thick glass. ALIEN FACES

are pressed against it. Mumble yells and shoots to the

surface.

THE PENGUIN ENCLOSURE

High up he sees the viewing gallery. A great CROWD of ALIENS

staring and chattering

                       MUMBLE (V.O.)

             Aliens everywhere, watching you eat,

             watching you sleep

Mumble backs away and knocks into the PAINTED HORIZON. He

puts out a wing to steady himself and notices a metal tag on

it. This place is beginning to upset him.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                       MUMBLE

                 (yells at the aliens)

             What have you done to my wing! This is

             not my home! I want to get out of here!

The other penguins stand around, immobile, chomping fish.

                       OLD TIMER PENGUIN

             Guess he's new here

THE PENGUIN ENCLOSURE

Caption: A year later

Specators POV: Mumble stands around, like the others,

ignoring the aliens, chomping fish

His POV: Day after day, the view constantly the same, except

for the groupings of spectators high in the viewing Gallery

                       MUMBLE (V.O.)

             After a while, you learn to stop fighting

             it. Stop protesting, take the knocks.

CU Mumble: A camera flashes. A fish hits him, he doesn't

flinch

                       MUMBLE (V.O.)

             ...just take what comes and live inside

             your mind

THE SAME/ PASSAGE OF TIME

Another day and another. Night follows day follows night.

Spectators come and go. The penguins stand like statues.

Though bubbles begin to appear above Mumbles head, snapshots

of his past experiences

                       MUMBLE (V.O.)

             Sometimes I thought about dad and mum.

             Sometimes the Amigos, and others I'd met

             along the way. But mostly I thought about

             Ella, wondering who she ended up with.

             Whether she had enough food to eat.

             whether she still remembered our song.

In the though bubble, Ella has appeared singing never can say

goodbye. Mumbles feet begin shuffling to the rythm

                                                        76.

SPECTATORS GALLERY

Most of the specators are leaving but one young girls stops

and stares

                     YOUNG GIRL

           Look Mommy! It's dancing!

She bangs on the glass in her excitement.

PENGUIN ENCLOSURE

Mumble, woken from his reverie, looks up and sees her looking

at him.

                     MUMBLE

           What? What did I do?

The little girl who is pointing at mumbles feet. Mumble looks

down, realizes what his feet are doing, looks up again.

                     MUMBLE (CONT'D)

           You like that? Well how about this.

He does a more elaborate step. The Mother shouts in

disbelief. Various other specators come back and join her.

Mumbles fellow captives are unimpressed.

                     PENGUIN #1

           Oh-Oh, another one gone troppo

                     PENGUIN #2

           You think its infectious

                     PENGUIN #3

           I sure hope not

They shuffle away

IN THE SPECTATORS GALLERY.

The aliens, in contrast, are loving it. Already a crowd has

gathered, laughing and clapping.

NEXT DAY

The Gallery is packed. Mumble keeps dancing

                                                           77.

NEXT DAY

Theres a riot going on up there. People fighting to get a

view. Newspaper reporters, TV cameras.

The other penguins in the enclosure have moved back, giving

Mumble more space. Every specattor is focussed on him. Mumble

is focussed on the spectators.

                     MUMBLE (VO

           Yes. Yes. At last something was

           happening. I was finally getting through

           to them!

THE TRANSPORTER BOX

A squawking Mumble is thrust inside and the lid slams shut on

him. Kerchunk.

THE EMPEROR COLONY

Silence, then across the vast expanse a TINY FIGURE appears

on the horizon.

                       PENGUIN V/O'S

           ...What's that?

           ...Where?

           ...Coming from the Inland!

A couple of Penguins watch the approaching figure.

                       PENGUINS

           ...Is it a Penguin?

           ...Is it one of ours?

LATER

Mumble approaches the two sentries. The colony is much

diminished: only small groups scattered here and there.

                     MUMBLE

           Hi, where is everybody!?

                     PENGUINS

           Who wants to know?

                      MUMBLE

           I used to live here. When's the Great

           Gathering?

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                               78.

CONTINUED:

                       PENGUINS

             This is it. I guess

                       MUMBLE

             This is all that's left?

Other penguins are gathering to scrutinise the stranger.

                         PENGUINS

             ... So Who's this?

             ...Kinda small for an emperor.

             ...(suspicious) Where did you say you were

             from?

Then a female penguin bursts out of the crowd.

                       ELLA

             Mumble?! Its Mumble!!

                       MUMBLE

             Ella! Is it you. You haven't changed a

             bit.

As he speaks, his eyes are drawn to the huge number of FLUFFY

CHICKS following behind her

                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)

             Are these all yours?

                       ELLA

             They're my singing students.

                       MUMBLE

             So. You never....

                       ELLA

             Of course not. I was waiting for you.

                       MUMBLE

             But that's fantastic. I've got so much to

             tell you - to tell everyone.

                 (To the gathering crowd)

             I found out who's been causing the

             Scarcity!

                       ELLA

             Huh?

                                                          (CONTINUED)

                                                          79.

CONTINUED: (2)

                    MUMBLE

          I know who's been taking our fish!

          I made contact with Aliens!

          They're coming here. Right behind me.

          Listen.

They listen. Above the wind   faint electronic BEEPING SOUND.

                    PENGUINS

          ...Who's doing all the shouting

          ...Its Mumble. He's worse than before.

                    MUMBLE

          No, honestly Aliens will be here soon!

          You have to believe me. We came in a big

          hollow bird and they landed on the ice

          and....

CARUSO bursts through the crowd.

                    CARUSO.

          You again! And still full of the same old

          nonsense.

                    MUMBLE

          But its true!!

The BEEP is quite audible now - a little faster and louder.

Curious, Ella ambles round behind mumble tro see what's

making the noise

                    CARUSO.

          Move along everyone. Pay no attention.

          There's no such thing as aliens

                    ELLA

          So who fixed him up with this.

She turns him around to reveal some kind of circuit board

glued to his back: a small aerial, winking red lights. A

TRANSMITTER.

A gasp of fear and astonishment from the penguins. Caruso is

momentarily speechless.

                    PENGUINS

          ...Does it hurt?

          ....Its not made of feathers thats for

          sure

          ...what's it gonna do

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                         80.

                    MUMBLE

          It's so they can find me.

              (cocks an ear)

          That's them now. Listen.

A distant rumbling, like some monstrous cataclysm is

approaching

                    CARUSO

          You led them here. Are you crazy!!

                    MUMBLE

          You said they didn't exist.

                    CARUSO

          They'll slaughter us. Head for the sea!

                    MUMBLE

          No. Do this. Do Happy feet.

He starts tap dancing. The penguins are torn, between

Caruso's instructions and Mumbles.

                    MUMBLES

          Its what they understand. They can't

          talk, they can't sing. They speak with

          their feet. Do it.

A few adventurous souls begin to copy him, out of fear if

nothing else.

As they do so, the sky begins to darken. A strange whirling

wind starts whipping the snow around them. The very earth

seems to be shaking under them.

                    CARUSO.

          Now look what you've done!

                    PENGUINS

          ...its the end of the world.

          ....Its all Mumbles fault. I told you

Wishful rounds on them angrily.

                    WISHFUL

          Just do what the kid says.

They start dancing.

The tide is beginning to turn in his favour

          That's it! Excellent! Riba Riba,

          penguinos!

          Shake those hips. Come on, bust a move!!

          Adhere to the wisdoms!! The Ancients will

          protect us

As he shouts his he is blown off his feet by a tremendous

gust of wind

Caruso tumbles head over heels as a massive Chinook

helicopter rises over the hirizon, its massive rotors mashing

the air.

It swoops down over the penguin nation and lands a little

distance away.

Music Over: Wanna Dance with Somebody.

THOUSANDS OF EMPEROR PENGUIN DANCING WITH PURE, ABANDONED

JOY.

          From that day on, No one quite knows how

          it happened, but the black icebergs began

          to disappear and the fish became abundant

          once more.

A CONFERENCE ROOM

Suited figures are seated round a large table, watching as

IMAGES of the DANCING PENGUIN COLONY play on a video screen.

Without the music it's less obviously a dance.

CONTINUED:

                       EXPERT

             Yes, quite extraordinary. (stares at the

             screen) some kind of neurological

             disorder? a nutritional deficiency

             perhaps. We'd certainly back the

             long-term study.

                       CHAIRMAN

             And the international treaty?

                       DELEGATE#1

             Yes. This is exactly the leverage we need

             for an embargo. No fishing

             whatsoever...legal, illegal, sanctioned,

             whatever.

                       DELEGATE#2

             So we all step up policing of the pirate

             factory ships. And we pressure that

             country to stop their so-called

             `experimental' fishing.

                       DELEGATE#3

             Yes, if our government asks your

             government to approach their government

             to call off their fleet...

                       DELEGATE#2

             Better if their government hear it from

             our government via your government...

                       CHAIRMAN

             What the heck. The amount of publicity

             this is generating, they'd have world war

             three if they didn't stop.

THE COLONY

In the confusion of penguins we find MUMBLE, ELLA and their

chick

                       MUMBLE (V.O.)

             Ella's gave up teaching to look after our

             chick. We take turns looking after her

             and going to get the fish.

As we watch, Ella moves off, joining the great to and fro of

penguins along the highway to the sea.

             But the way I see it. Theres so much out

             there we don't understand...,

SPACE

Still pulling back

             ....the stuff you think is small stuff

             could actually be the big stuff.

Keep pulling back from the world, the solar system,       the

galaxy.

                       MUMBLE (V.0

             Or am I not making sense here?

Further back. Our galaxy is framed in something like a bomb-

sight.

                       VOICE#1

             Is there a problem? I thought this one

             was barren.

IN THE DOME

We`re somewhere otherworldly, inside a clear dome the size of

a stadium, with a view of the heavens. In the centre of this

space, always just out of shot, two illdefined figures are

talking, subtitled:

                       VOICE#2

             More or less. But one of the stars we're

             harvesting supports these things here.

Projected somehow in mid-air A 3-D image of Times square in

winter with tiny people milling around in black coats

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                        85.

                         VOICE#1

             So...?

                       VOICE#2

             Well. Exactly. But what we didn't know

             about before was these things here

An image of the dancing penguins appears.

                       VOICE#2 (CONT'D)

             Just thought you'd want to see them

             before...you know.

The shadowy figure laughs, enjoying the image.

                        VOICE#1

             Hmm.   Charming

                         VOICE#2

             So.    We go ahead. Or...?

                       VOICE#1

             No. Better leave them be. See what

             sector twelves got to offer instead.

The bomb sight moves away from our galaxy to another part of

the universe

With that the two figures head off across the great shadowy

interior.

The projector beam catches them, briefly, throwing up the

giant shadows of these aliens They look very like huge

penguins.

As they walking solemnly out of shot with their hands behind

their backs one of them breaks step to do a little jig.

RUN TITLES
