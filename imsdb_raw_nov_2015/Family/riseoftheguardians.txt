           JACK (V.O.)

           Darkness. That's the first thing I

           remember. It was dark, and it was

           cold. And I was scared.

          The silhouette of a body appears as it drifts into a ray of

          light, refracted through water, which turns into...

          A MOON - SEEN IN REFLECTION ON A SHEET OF ICE

          The moonlight intensifies almost magically, and the ice above

          begins to spider-web and crack.

          EXT. FROZEN POND - NIGHT

          Snow-covered trees in every direction. The ice in the pond

          continues to crack, until finally a hole splinters open. A

          young man floats out of the water, bathed in the intense

          moonlight. This is JACK FROST - thin, pale, barefoot, his

          tousled hair frosted white.

           JACK (V.O.)

           But then...then I saw the moon. It

           was so big and it was so bright,

           and it seemed to chase the darkness

           away. And when it did...I wasn't

           scared anymore.

          Jack floats back down onto the ice as the hole closes up

          underneath him.

           JACK (V.O.)

           Why I was there, and what I was

           meant to do - that I've never

           known. And a part of me wonders if

           I ever will.

          Jack looks around, confused, then turns toward the moonlight

          as it dims a bit.

          Jack carefully treads across the ice until he hits something

          with his feet. He looks down, and at his feet is a wooden

          staff. Curious, he picks it up. Almost immediately the

          staff begins to glow a cold blue in his hands. Odd.

           Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 2.

          Jack almost drops it as the base of the staff comes in

          contact with the ground. Frost shoots out and spreads across

          the ice. Jack is visibly confused.

          He touches a few trees with his staff sending frost up their

          trunks. Then he swings the staff again, more confident, as

          he begins to run across the frozen pond.

          Another swing, and a gust of wind swirls him high up into the

          air. Jack floats for a moment only to fall back down to

          earth and into the trees. Jack grabs hold of a tree branch

          and pulls himself up to see a small town off in the distance.

          EXT. BURGESS SETTLEMENT - TOWN CENTER - CONTINUOUS

          A collection of simple timber houses with thatched roofs.

          Jack comes in for a landing, and it's a rocky one. He stands

          up, still elated, and brushes himself off.

          As Jack makes his way into town, settlers are warming their

          hands by campfire. Jack doesn't recognize anyone.

                          JACK

           (to the townsfolk)

           Hello. Hello. Good evening,

           ma'am.

                          (BEAT)

           Ma'am?

          The settlers walk past Jack, not noticing him. Jack crouches

          down as a YOUNG BOY runs toward him.

                          JACK

           Oh, ah, excuse me, can you tell me

           where I am?

          The boy runs right through Jack, as if he were a ghost. Jack

          staggers back in shock. He's speechless, as if the wind had

          been knocked out him. His emotions causing it to snow.

                          JACK

           Hello! Hello!

          Townsfolk continue to pass through Jack, unaware of his

          presence. Shaken, Jack turns and retreats into the forest.

           JACK (V.O.)

           My name is Jack Frost -- how do I

           know that? The moon told me so.

           But that was all he ever told me.

           And that was a long, long time ago.

          SEQ. 175 - INTRO TO NORTH

          EXT. NORTH POLE - DUSK

          FIERY GYPSY VIOLIN MUSIC as we move through clouds to reveal

          a MASSIVE ICE CANYON, and just around a bend, the incredible

          hidden fortress of NORTH, aka SANTA CLAUS.

          INT. NORTH'S WORKSHOP - DUSK

          We glimpse a familiar-looking RED JACKET and CAP with white

          trim on a coat hanger just as a pair of tongs SLAM a block of

          ice onto a stone work table--

          IN QUICK CUTS: A CHAINSAW shears the block in half, spraying

          ice. North lifts up the chainsaw revealing a massive tatoo

          on his arm, the word NAUGHTY clearly visible.

          Three ELVES huddle in a doorway around a plate of cookies,

          each licking their own tasty morsel.

           NORTH (O.S.)

           Still waiting for cookies!

          As North crosses the background, the elves lower the cookies

          from their mouths, their faces frozen in fear.

          The elves duck out of the way as North launches himself

          across the floor on his rolling chair -- CLOSE as his huge

          HAND gropes furiously among his WORK TOOLS, finally grabbing

          a miniature HAMMER. As North's humming along with his music,

          delicately CHISELING into the ice, we see a second arm sleeve

          tatoo, the word NICE clearly visible--

          His INTENSE BLUE EYE magnified in a JEWELER'S EYEPIECE -- a

          delicate SCULPTING TOOL cuts fine details into the ice--

          His hands place the finished piece on a curving ICE TRACK: An

          ice LOCOMOTIVE. It belches ice vapor and chugs down the

          track, picking up speed--

                          NORTH

           Yes!

          North's hand grabs a cookie from a plate held up by the two

          Elves.

           Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 4.

          One of the elves gives his cohort a look and points to the

          plate as it chews with a mouth full of food, to which it then

          unfurls its tongue and lets the half eaten morsels spill out

          onto the plate.

                          NORTH

           Ah, finally!

          He takes a bite and leans toward the ice track. He chuckles

          as the train hits a loop, and launches off a ramp into midair

          -- then WINGS unfold -- JET ENGINES sprout and ignite and the

          train lifts off the track--

          Suddenly, the DOOR is thrown open by one of North's concerned

          YETIS, sending the flying ice locomotive skidding across the

          floor in pieces.

                          YETI

           Arghbal...

                          NORTH

           Ach!

          The yeti cries out covering his mouth in shame. North cries

          out, devastated. The yeti, equally emotional, lets out

          another whimper. North looks down at the broken toy and

          takes a moment to collect himself.

                          NORTH

           How many times have I told you to

           knock?

                          YETI

           Warga blarghgha!

                          NORTH

           What...? The Globe?

          North leaps up -- draws a HUGE SCIMITAR from its sheath and

                         HEADS OUT--

          INT. NORTH'S GLOBE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          A sea of tiny BELLS on the heads of panicking elves part as

          North's huge boots stomp through.

                          NORTH

           Shoo with your pointy heads. Why

           are you always under boot?

          He pushes his way past a couple of his YETI WORKERS --

          they're looking up in fear at -

          THE GLOBE OF BELIEF

          Covered with LIGHTS blanketing the continents. But North

          notices that all at once, HUNDREDS OF LIGHTS suddenly go out.

                          NORTH

           What is this?

          Now MORE LIGHTS, in GREATER NUMBERS, as if something is

          snuffing them out by the thousands. North's concern grows.

                          (TO YETI)

           Wardle bawddrel.

          Before the Yeti can finish, a WIND whips up from out of

          nowhere -- North stares in outrage as a blanket of SWIRLING

          BLACK SAND, crawls over the lights, and shrouds the ENTIRE

          GLOBE in inky DARKNESS--

          The elves scurry in a panic, then all at once the BLACK SAND

          WHOOSHES UP off the Globe -- rushes up through the ceiling as

          the remaining sand bursts into a puff of smoke and dissipates

          into the air --

          As the wind dies, the scattered pieces of debris settle to

          the ground, and the globes lights come back on, North whirls

          to see a HUGE SHADOW flash across the floors and curving

          walls of his fortress. It quickly disappears, leaving

          nothing but the distant ECHO of...LAUGHTER?

          North is frozen, looking up into the darkness, gravely:

                          NORTH

           Can it be?

           (then calls off)

           Dingle!

          A group of elves step forward gleefully pointing to

          themselves, as if they're all "Dingle". The excitement

          quickly turns to confusion.

                          NORTH

           Make preparations! We are going to

           have company.

          North reaches out for a large EMERGENCY LEVER, TWISTS and

                         PRESSES IT--

          From the tallest spire of North's fortress, NORTHERN LIGHT

          A little fairy, carrying a coin, flies above the head of a

          sleeping child. She quickly ducks under the pillow and comes

          out the other side with a tooth in hand.

          A hive of activity, and at the center a winged figure barks

          out orders like a harried air-traffic controller. This is

          TOOTH. A Mini Tooth Fairy flies up to Tooth as thousands of

          tiny MINI TOOTH FAIRIES continue their work behind them.

           TOOTH (O.S.)

           Wait!

          And suddenly everything stops. Tooth whips around, and we

          finally see her beautiful FACE.

          She's holding up a little tooth, and gazing at it with dreamy

          adoration. The surrounding fairies tweet with excitement.

                          TOOTH (CONT'D)

           It's her first tooth. Have you

           ever seen a more adorable lateral

           incisor in all of your life?!

           Look how she flossed!

          The fairies' tweets turn to concern, turning Tooth's

          attention to North's AURORA SIGNAL stretching across the sky.

          She gasps, and flies off like a rocket toward the source of

          the signal, accompanied by a few of her ranking fairies.

           My fellow Guardians - It is our job

           to watch over the children of the

           world, and keep them safe - to

           bring wonder, hope and dreams.

           And so, I've called us all here for

           one reason, and one reason only -

           the children are in danger.

          Much of this we hear over the following...

          EXT./INT. CHILD'S BEDROOM

          We pull out from the face of a sleeping child to reveal a

          stream of sand swirling overhead. It's a dream and it's taken

          the shape of a child playing soccer.

          We FOLLOW the Dreamsand stream out his window and up into the

          sky where we see DOZENS of strands of sand descending to

          earth. Keep following up, through majestic CLOUDS...

          ...to reveal a small, GLOWING GOLDEN CLOUD of Dreamsand

          shimmering among the clouds, trailing the golden threads.

          The strands are being controlled by a small portly figure,

          THE SANDMAN. Suddenly, North's emergency signal zips by. The

          Sandman turns to look and his eyes narrow, visibly concerned.

          Sandy closes his eyes and in an instant the Dreamsand cloud

          suddenly SWIRLS around him, changing form into a small

          BIPLANE, with Sandy in the cockpit. He BARREL ROLLS the

          plane into a dizzying dive through the spectacular cloudscape

          and flies off into the distance.

          A few EASTER EGGS pop up out of the ground; their little legs

          carry them out of the way of a fast approaching object.

          Speeding along through a subterranean tunnel, we can barely

          keep up with a DIMLY-LIT FIGURE as it races at blinding

          speed, leaping and zigzagging through a series of TUNNELS --

          EXT. A SNOWY EXPANSE IN THE NORTH POLE

          A hole opens in the snow, and a pair of rabbit ears pops out.

          A huge rabbit climbs out and brushes off the snow, annoyed.

          The six foot tall figure is BUNNYMUND.

                          BUNNYMUND

           Ah, it's freezing.

          He shivers with cold, then goes slogging through the snow.

           Here we go...

          North grabs Bunny's painted egg, casually juggling it in his

          hand as he walks off. Meanwhile Sandy, who is being served

          eggnog by a yeti, suddenly notices something high above.

           BUNNYMUND (O.S.)

           North, I, I don't have time for

           eggs to finish up.

          The moon rises into view, high up in the ceiling; its rays of

          light begin to shine brightly through as they cascade down

          the walls of the globe room.

          Sandy points to the moon unsuccessfully to get the others'

          attention.

          Sandy puts his fingers in his mouth to whistle, a silent

          musical note forming above his head.

                          (TO BUNNY)

           Why are rabbits always so nervous.

          Sandy waves a sand flag above his head, pointing and jumping

          up and down as the moonlight continues to fill the room.

                          NORTH

          Sandy tries to signal with a golden arrow, pointing toward

          the ceiling, but to no avail as the others continue their

          bickering. Sandy thinks Tooth has noticed for a split

          second, but then -

           with some eggs.

           Hey, I hate to interrupt the, "We

           work so hard once a year club" but

           could we concentrate on the matter--

          Sandy can't take it anymore, grabs an elf by his hat, and

          vigorously shakes it's bell. The other Guardians are finally

          silenced and all turn to look at Sandy, who points up, a sand

          crescent moon forming above his head. The dizzy elf staggers

          away. Finally the others turn to see the shaft of moonlight

          as it concentrates on the circle between them.

                          NORTH

           Aah! Man in Moon! Sandy, why

           didn't you say something?

          Sandy gives him a deadpan stare, Dreamsand smoke shoots out

          his ears.

           It's been a long time old friend!

           What is big news?

          Everyone looks to the center of the intense spot of

          moonlight, the light ebbs away, leaving a dark spot --

          -- which resolves into the shadowed silhouette of PITCH. The

          Guardians look on, stunned.

                          BUNNYMUND

           It is Pitch.

          North pats his belly and gives Bunny a look.

          In answer, the shadow of Pitch disappears and the circle of

          moonlight intensifies and SHRINKS, concentrating further

          illuminating an ORNATE SYMBOL on the floor, at the center of

          their circle. The symbol rises out of the ground revealing a

          large gem at the head of a pillar.

                          TOOTH

           Ah, guys, you know what this means?

          The moons light suddenly refracts through the gem casting

          light all over the chamber.

          A Dreamsand Four-Leaf clover forms above Sandy's head.

           is not a Guardian.

          EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - NIGHT

          A hooded figure with a familiar looking staff rests atop a

          Post Office box on the opposite end of the street. The man

          touches the staff to the ground, sending a streak of frost

          across the street.

          A RUSSIAN BOY approaches a water fountain, turns the handle

          and moves in for a sip. But as he does, the water freezes

          magically, and the boy's tongue is stuck to the frozen water.

          His friends can't help but laugh.

          A mail man walks across the street and a PATCH OF ICE

          magically appears under his feet. He scrambles, and BOOM! -

          lands on his butt. Just behind the man, we see the TRAIL OF

          FROST climb up the side of a building. We stay on the frost

          as it moves up along a rain pipe, and through the windows we

          see...

          A boy try to feed his gold fish, but a layer of ice suddenly

          forms along the water surface and prevents the fish from

          reaching its food. We move along the side of the building...

          A writer in his study sits next to stacks of papers. The

          window suddenly swings open and a gust of wind sends the

          pages flying out the window. We move along the building,

          across clothes lines and power lines as they freeze.

          We continue to move up, and finally discover the culprit.

          Jack Frost makes his way atop a cathedral spire and takes in

          the view; the full moon bathes the city in moonlight.

           Hey wind...

          Jack chuckles as he calls the wind. The trees begin to sway

          and leaves fly into the air. Jack grabs hold of the spire,

          smiling as the wind blows past.

                          JACK

           Take me home!

          Jack lets go and the wind carries him into the air and

          through the clouds. Night turns to day as Jack flies from

          one horizon to the other.

                          JACK

           Woooooohoooooooooo!

           SNOOOOOWWWW DAAAAYYYYYY!!!

          Jack continues on down and zooms through the streets.

          Pedestrians clench their jackets and reach for their hats as

          gusts of wind, snow, and streaks of frost are left in Jack's

          wake.

          EXT. FROZEN POND

          Jack flies in, and with the wind behind him skates across an

          all too familiar pond. As the wind zips across the pond it

          knocks a BOOK out of the hands of a little boy walking alone,

          this is JAMIE.

          cover - "THEY'RE OUT THERE! - MYSTERIES, MYTHICAL CREATURES

          AND THE UNEXPLAINED PHENOMENA." Jack flies into frame and

          lands beside Jamie.

          Jack hops off the fence and walks amongst the kids, peering

          Jack reaches down and grabs a hand full of snow from off the

          ground. With his palm open, Jack uses his magic to form the

          perfect snowball.

          He then puckers his lips, and blows onto it with his icy

          breath. The snowball turns a light shade of blue. There's

          something going on here.

          WHOOSH! - the snowball goes flying through the air and -

          head. Jamie looks up, peeved, and turns.

          Then we watch as his face changes...a mischievous sparkle

          comes into his eyes. A big smile. Make no mistake,

          something magical has just happened.

          couple kids making snow barricades.

          MONTY (oddball with big glasses) with his back turned

                          (LAUGHS)

           You struck first!

                          CLAUDE

           Oh!

          Suddenly we see Caleb struck in the side of the head with one

          of Jack's snowballs; Claude can't help but laugh.

                          JACK

           Free for all!

          And just like that we find ourselves in a take-no-prisoners

          snowball fight, the kids pummeling each other mercilessly.

                          JACK

           Alright, who needs ammo?

          Jack supplies the kids with more snowballs. The kids are

          loving this.

                          JACK

                          (WALLA)

           Look at that.

          The mayhem continues as Jamie, using his sled as a shield, is

          knocked backward into a snowman, crushing it underneath him.

          A snowball flies overhead and hits CUPCAKE, a tough third

          grader as wide as she is tall, in the back of the head.

          Dread sets in amongst the other kids, Cupcake squints -

          gunslinger eyes.

                          PIPPA

           Crud, I hit Cupcake.

                          MONTY

           She hit Cupcake.

                          CLAUDE

           You hit Cupcake?

          Jamie is flat on his back, terrified. He looks up to see

          Cupcake standing over him. Then, BOOF! Jack hits Cupcake

          with a magical snowball. The kids gasp in horror.

                          CLAUDE

           Oh!

                          CALEB

           Did you throw that?

                          MONTY

           No.

                          PIPPA

           Wasn't me.

          A moment, and then Cupcake starts laughing as Jack's magic

          takes hold.

          Cupcake chases the kids down the hill, holding the head of

          her snowman in her hands. Jack, all the while, runs along

          side taking pleasure in the excitement.

                          JAMIE

                          (WALLA)

           You can't catch me.

                          JACK

           Ooh, little slippery!

          Jack jumps ahead, blasting a sheet of ice behind him. The

          kids fall to the ground, except for Jamie, who lands on his

          sled, and slides head first down the sheet of ice into town.

           Jamie! Turn, turn! That's the

           street! What are you doing? Stop!

           There's traffic!

          Jamie suddenly shoots out between the trees and careens past

          a set of parked cars.

          Jack's path of ice covers the street. As Jamie turns, his

          speed only escalates, sending him directly into traffic.

          Jamie barely misses a moving truck, spinning it out of

          control, sending furniture out the back, and causing a four

          car pile up.

                          JAMIE

           Whoa!

                          JACK

           Whoa, don't worry kid, I gotcha.

          Jamie looks back, then quickly ahead as terror comes into his

          eyes. Jack can't help but smile.

                          JACK

           Hold on. It's gonna be alright.

                          JAMIE

                          JACK

           Keep up with me kid! Take a left.

          Jamie rockets through a pedestrian intersection, narrowly

          missing those in the crosswalk.

          Jack flies over to the far side of the street, sending the

          streak of ice and Jamie up onto the sidewalk.

           PEDESTRIAN #3 (O.S.)

           Look at that dude!

          Jamie flies off the sidewalk and back into the middle of the

          street, almost knocking over a postman. As Jack flies by

          Jamie's side he sees the look of excitement come into Jamie's

          face. Jack smiles, knowing he's responsible.

          Jack sees an oncoming snowplow and quickly jumps ahead,

          carried by the wind, to divert the ice trail.

                          JACK

           Whoa.

          Jamie's sled suddenly turns, narrowly missing the oncoming

          truck and barrels toward Jack's newly formed ice ramp...

                          JAMIE

           AAAAHHHHHHHH!

          Jamie closes his eyes as the ramp launches Jamie over the

          street, high into the air, and toward the statue of Thaddeus

          Burgess, colonial settler - 1680. Jamie's friends stand in

          awe, mouths wide open, as he sails through the air.

          Jamie opens his eyes and the look of fear suddenly turns to

          joy. Jack looks on smiling.

          Jamie lands safely in a large mound of snow. Jack jumps onto

          the Statue of Thaddeus Burgess.

          Jamie's friends all come running to Jamie's aide, scared.

          But Jamie gets up.

           okay?

           Whoaaa! Did you guys see that? It

           was amazing! I slid - I did a jump

           and I slid under a car-ERF!!

          A sofa from the moving van suddenly knocks Jamie down...

          There's a moment of silence as the kids wait to see if Jamie

          is okay. Then, Jamie rises up from behind the sofa grinning,

          a new gap in his smile. He holds up a tooth.

                          JAMIE

           fun we just had? That wasn't the

           gonna buy? How much do you think

           she's going to leave?

          As Jack looks down from the statue his frustration grows.

          Storm clouds overhead rumble and darken. Flurries of snow

          begin to intensify.

           freezing. I can't feel my toes.

           Ah, it's hot cocoa time.

          Jack jumps down from the statue, trying to engage the kids.

          But it's too late, the kids take off. Jack blocks Jamie's

          way as the boy comes running at him.

                          JACK

           What's a guy gotta do to get a

           little attention around here!

          WHOOOSH! Jamie runs through Jack, as if he where a ghost.

          SEQ. 700 - NIGHT FALLS IN TOWN

          INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Jamie plays with a TOY ROBOT as DRAWINGS AND CHARTS of

          mystery creatures hang on the wall behind him: UFO's, aliens,

          Bigfoot, you name it. There's even a drawing of Jamie flying

          in midair on his sled.

           JAMIE (O.S.)

           ...I did this jump and it was

           amazing and I slide under a car and

           it was awesome! Then I was flying

           down this hill and I was like

           whoosh, whoosh, whoosh through all

           these cars, and then the sled hit

           this, this thing, and I was like

           way up in the air.

          He mimes flying in the air with his robot, then CRASHING to

          the bed as Sophie and their dog sit listening--

                          JAMIE

           -- and then BAM! The sofa hit me,

           and, and see?

           (opens mouth, tries to say

           `my tooth came out!)

           Ah hoo hay ow!

          We reveal JAMIE'S MOM in the room. Sophie LAUGHS and tries

          to stick a finger in the gap in his gums.

                          JAMIE'S MOM

           Alright you, tooth under your

           pillow?

          Jamie sets the TOY ROBOT on his nightstand, then grabs a

          stuffed rabbit next to his pillow to reveal a CAMERA AND

          FLASHLIGHT.

                          JAMIE

           Yeah. I'm ready.

           Now don't stay up trying to see

           her, Jamie, or she won't come.

                          JAMIE

           But I can do it this time! You

           wanna help me, Soph? We can hide

           and see the Tooth Fairy!

           Hide, hide, hide, hide!

          Jamie's Mom picks Sophie up off the bed and lifts her over

          her shoulder. Their dog gets up and begins licking Jamie's

          face.

                          JAMIE'S MOM

           Uh uh, straight to bed now, mister.

                          JAMIE

           Mom...

          ...We see Jack Frost, outside, hanging upsidedown watching

          them through the window. A pang. The glass frosts over.

          EXT. ROOF OF JAMIE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

          Jack flips onto the roof, a little pensive. He makes his way

          toward the roof's peak and looks up at the MOON, in full

          view. It lights up the night sky.

                          JACK

           If there's something I'm doing

           wrong, can you, can you just tell

           me what it is?

                          (NO RESPONSE)

           Because I've tried everything, and

           no one ever sees me.

                          (NO RESPONSE)

           You put me here, the least you can

           do is tell me, tell me why.

          A beat. The Moon shines silently down. Jack turns away in

          frustration.

          Jack leaps off the roof, onto a telephone pole, and begins

          walking across some telephone wires. A stream of Dreamsand

          suddenly zips by behind him, then another, which swoops

          around in front of him. Jack turns and looks up, a smile now

          on his lips.

                          JACK

           Right on time, Sandman.

          The Dreamsand descends from the sky, and drifts into windows

          around the town. Jack runs along the telephone wire until he

          can reach out and intercept one of the passing streams. An

          adjacent stream takes the shape of a dolphin which turns

          toward Jack, before continuing on its way to a waiting child.

          Then, we follow one of the streams into a window...

          INT. CUPCAKE'S BEDROOM - BURGESS - CONTINUOUS

          Dreamsand floats into a window, where CUPCAKE is in bed,

          hugging a stuffed unicorn in her sleep. The Dreamsand swirls

          over her head, and morphs into a little girl riding a

          unicorn. The girl smiles at the lovely dream as it flies

          around the room.

          Then the room darkens as a wispy, shadowy figure with a

          familiar laugh crawls out from under the bed, and rises up.

          It's Pitch. He notices Cupcake's dream.

                          PITCH

           Ohhhh, I thought I heard the

           clippity-clop of a unicorn. What

           an adorable dream!

          His face softens, seemingly moved...

                          PITCH

           (leans down to Cupcake)

           And look. At. Her. Precious

           child. So sweet, so full of hope

           and wonder. Why, there's only one

           thing missing...a touch of fear.

          Pitch reaches into Cupcake's dream, and touches a bony finger

          to the unicorn. It turns ashen and black, and disintegrates.

          Cupcake flinches in her sleep. Pitch snickers, delighted.

                          PITCH

           Hahaha! That never gets old!

          Pitch swirls the Dreamsand around and it all turns into black

          corrupted Nightmare sand.

                          PITCH

           Feel your fear. Come on. Come on,

           that's right.

          The black sand morphs into a horrific, shadowy bucking horse -

          a NIGHTMARE.

                          PITCH

           Yesss. What a pretty little

           Nightmare.

          Gleefully, he grabs the Nightmare's mane --

                          PITCH

           Now, I want you to go tell the

           others the wait is over.

          -- and sends it out the window, where it joins a posse of

          other Nightmares coursing through the streets. They take off

          and fly into the night sky.

          EXT. BURGESS - NIGHT

          Pitch steps out into the street from an adjacent alley,

          avoiding the rays of moonlight. He looks up to the sky and

          stares at the MOON.

                          PITCH

           Don't look at me like that, old

           friend. You must have known this

           finally ready. Are your Guardians?

          EXT. BURGESS - NIGHT

          Jack walks along a telephone wire as the Dreamsand disappears

          from the sky. Suddenly a shadowy figure and an unfamiliar

          noise zips by behind him.

                          JACK

           Whoa!

          In the background, residents get ready for the night.

           RESIDENTS (O.S.)

                          (WALLA)

           Did you leave the windows open

           again? The garage door is wide

           open.

          Jack leaps over a house to an adjacent tree to investigate

          and again, something zooms behind him. Jack jumps down from

          the tree and onto a truck in a nearby alley.

          EXT. STREETS OF BURGESS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

          Suddenly: WHOOSH! The SHADOW flashes by, knocking over a

          trash can.

          Jack jumps down from the truck and backs up out of the

          alleyway into a clearing...

           BUNNYMUND (O.S.)

           Hello, mate.

          Jack turns around, ready to strike. He squints, as into the

          light steps...

           Been a long time. Blizzard of 68, I

           believe? Easter Sunday, wasn't it?

          Jack is completely bewildered --

                          JACK

           Bunny? You're not still mad about

           that...are yah?

                          BUNNYMUND

           Yes.

          Bunny whips out his boomerang and casually looks at it as he

          holds it in his hands.

           Fellas...

          Before Jack realizes what's happening a HUGE HAND reaches

          into frame and lifts him off his feet.

                          JACK

           Hey!

                          YETI

           Durbha wahla.

          Jack has been snatched up by two huge YETIS.

                          JACK

           Put me down! What the...

          Jack is shoved head first into a sack. A yeti whips out a

          snow globe, and smashes it on the ground.

                          YETI

           Durtal bardla burdlew.

          A MAGIC PORTAL opens in front of them. The yetis make way

          for Bunny to leap in, but he demurs --

                          YETI

           Dwbard urghwetee.

                          BUNNYMUND

          He STAMPS HIS FOOT twice on the ground which SWIRLS OPEN -- a

          RABBIT HOLE magically appears. Bunny leaps into it and

          disappears along with the rabbit hole. In its place, from

          out of the ground grows a small green plant.

                          YETIS

           Bwardla arghl.

          The yetis throw Jack through the magic portal.

                          JACK

           Ahhhhhhhhh!

          The yetis then charge in after and disappear into the portal.

           NORTH (O.S.)

           He's here.

          Jack struggles out of the sack to see two elves staring at

                          NORTH

           Hey, there he is! Jack Frost!

          As North holds out his arms to welcome Jack, a Dreamsand

          snowflake appears above Sandy's head.

                          JACK

           Wow, you gotta be kidding me.

          Two Yetis suddenly grab Jack by the shoulders and lift him up

          onto his feet.

                          JACK

           Hey, hey. Whoa, put me down.

                          NORTH

           I hope the yetis treated you well?

                          JACK

           Oh, yeah. I love being shoved in a

                          JACK

           Obviously.

          Bunny stands off to the side, grumbling with his arms

          crossed. Jack suddenly notices the MINI TOOTH FAIRIES

          hovering near him, staring and twittering.

                          NORTH

           And the Tooth Fairy?

          Before Jack can answer, she's gliding toward him.

          Several swooning Mini Teeth flutter around a confused Jack,

          batting their lashes and screaming like crazed Beatles fans.

          Tooth collects herself, and...

          Sandy bolts up awake and steps up to Jack, smiling.

                          JACK

           Hey! Ho! Anyone wanna tell me why

           I'm here?

          The WISP OF DREAMSAND above Sandy's head morphs into a

          BARRAGE OF IMAGES.

           That's not really helping. But

           thanks, little man.

           I musta done something really bad

           to get you four together.

          Jack walks away from the group, frosting an elf with a tray

          of cookies as it marches past, then turns around.

                          JACK

          Off Jack's confusion, yetis light CEREMONIAL TORCHES with a

          WHOOSH. Elves leap from columns, unfurling homemade,

          celebratory BANNERS as they descend. Jack brushes off a few

          baby teeth who try to present him with a necklace made of

          paper snowflakes.

                          JACK

           What are you doing! Get, get that

          Jack's voice is drowned out by the sounds of horns and drums.

                          NORTH

           This is the best part!

          AN ELF MARCHING BAND strikes up, marching into the room. Two

          yetis move Jack on to a designated spot on the floor.

          Jack looks down to find an elf pointing at his bare feet.

          The elf then directs his attention to two approaching elves,

          carrying a pair of ceremonial boots. Jack's confusion

          escalates.

                          JACK

           Huh?

          A Yeti hands North an old large book. North blows off the

          dust, opens it, and begins clearing his throat. Jack

          clenches his jaw as he scans the room: The Mini Teeth

          continue to fawn, Sandy's smiling, Bunny's apathetic, and

          North looks on with pride.

          Jack suddenly SLAMS his staff down, sending a blast of FROST

          and WIND across the room. The torches go out and everything

          stops.

                          JACK

           What makes you think I want to be a

           Guardian?

          North bursts out in laughter holding the book in his hands

          then stops and looks to Jack, stone faced.

                          NORTH

           Of course you do!

           (to the elves)

           Music!

          The elves blare the trumpets again. Celebration!

          The music peters out again. An elf throws his trumpet to the

          ground and storms off. North, displeased, glowers.

                          JACK

           Look, this is all very flattering,

           but ah...you don't want me. You're

           all hard work and deadlines, and

           I'm snowballs and fun times. I'm

           not a Guardian.

                          BUNNYMUND

           You see, you can not say no. It is

           Oh, don't worry, I never got past

           the yetis.

          Jack looks over his shoulder; an angry yeti pounds his fist

          into his palm.

                          YETI

           Rwwarrrrrr.

                          JACK

           Oh, hey Phil.

                          NORTH

           Keep up, Jack! Keep up!

          North charges ahead.

          North's factory is bustling with activity: Yeti's are

          building toys, moving packages, while Elves are test piloting

          the various flying toys.

          As Jack walks behind North, surveying the factory, a duck toy

          suddenly flies over Jack's head. Jack ducks just in time and

          continues after North.

           Whoa!

                          (BEAT)

           I always thought the elves made the

           toys.

                          (WHISPERS)

           We just let them believe that.

          Jack looks over to see a group of elves eating Christmas

          ornaments and another electrocuting himself with Christmas

          lights. North smiles and calls to them.

                          NORTH

           Very nice! Keep up good work!

          North continues through the factory floor. He passes a yeti

          putting the finishing touches on a blue toy robot.

                          NORTH

                          (TO YETI)

           I don't like it. Paint it red.

          The yeti reacts in dismay as we reveal hundreds of finished

          blue robots.

                          NORTH

           Step it up, everybody.

          As North and Jack move to the opposite end of the chamber, we

          finally glimpse the orchestrated chaos of the entire

          workshop, in all it's magic and splendor.

          INT. NORTH'S OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER

          Jack follows North into his office. There are shelves filled

          with toys. Sketches and prototypes everywhere.

          North dusts his hands and turns to Jack. His sleeves are

          rolled. Jack notices that on one of North's forearms is

          tattooed the word NAUGHTY, and on the other, NICE. North

          grabs a plate from a nearby elf.

                          NORTH

           Fruit cake?

                          JACK

           Ah, no, thanks.

          North hurls it - crash! A pause as North looks at Jack.

                          NORTH

           Now we get down to tacks of brass!

                          JACK

                          (TO HIMSELF)

           Tacks of brass?

          As North cracks his knuckles, Jack stands silent. The wind

          suddenly slams North's office door behind them. Jack looks

          to the door, it locks itself, and he turns back. North moves

          in close to Jack, backing him up against the door.

                          NORTH

           Who are you, Jack Frost? What is

           your center?

          North pokes Jack in the chest.

                          JACK

           My center?

                          NORTH

           If Man in Moon chose you to be a

           Guardian, you must have something

           very special inside.

          North stands up straight and begins to stroke his beard as he

          gives Jack a curious look.

                          NORTH

           Hmmmm?

          North is standing in front of a shelf of Russian nesting

          dolls. One is carved to look like North himself.

                          NORTH (CONT'D)

           Here. This is how you see me, no?

           Very big, intimidating. But if you

           get to know me a little--

           (hands the doll to Jack)

           Well, go on.

          Jack gives North a curious look, then sets down his staff.

          He twists the doll in half, and inside is another carved

          North doll, this one is a more typical Santa Claus - red

          cheeked and cheery.

                          JACK

           You are downright jolly.

                          NORTH

           Ah, but not just jolly...

           Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 40.

          The dolls get progressively smaller as he twists them open,

          all versions of North, but all slightly different.

                          NORTH (CONT'D)

           I am also mysterious.

           (twist - smaller doll)

           And fearless.

           (twist - smaller doll)

           And caring. And at my center...

          Twist. As North approaches, Jack looks down and drops the

          final Russian doll into the palm of North's hand. It's the

          size of a jelly bean.

                          JACK

           There's a tiny wooden baby?

                          NORTH

           Look closer. What do you see?

          Jack holds it up to examine it.

                          JACK

           You have big eyes?

                          NORTH

           Yes! Big eyes. Very big. Because

           they are full! Of wonder! That is

           my center. It is what I was born

           with. Eyes that have always seen

           the wonder in everything!

          North raises his hands, and the toys on the shelves suddenly

          spring to life. Jack-in-the-boxes pop, toy trains speed

          around the room, soldiers march about, toy planes fly

          overhead. An elf gets carried aloft by a balloon.

          A flying toy plane glides by and we follow it as it makes its

          way around the room. A Christmas tree is ablaze with bright

          lights. Two double doors suddenly open as the flying car

          enters the factory floor.

                          NORTH

           Eyes that see lights in the trees,

           and magic in the air!

          As it crosses the frame, dozens of other toys are now flying

          around the massive chamber. It's a truly magical moment.

          North now stands outside his office, with Jack at his side.

                          NORTH

           This wonder is what I put into the

           world, and what I protect in

           children.

           is my center. What is yours?

                          JACK

                          (BEAT)

           I don't know.

          Jack looks down into his open palm, the wooden baby stares

          back at him. North closes Jack's hand. They exchange a look.

          Then, something suddenly jets past a window outside. Almost

          simultaneously, Bunny and Sandman come running down the

          hallway toward North and Jack.

                          BUNNYMUND

           We have a problem, mate! Trouble

           at the Tooth Palace.

          INT. LAUNCHING SHED - A MOMENT LATER

          North shoves open a set of double doors, followed closely by

          Bunny, Sandy, and Jack. Several Yeti's rush by as they

          prepare the hangar for launch.

           old...

          Suddenly: the SOUND of POUNDING HOOVES. BEASTLY SNORTING.

          SANTA'S INCREDIBLE SLEIGH comes into view. It's a huge,

          shiny, tricked out, jaw-dropping hot-rod of a sled.

                          JACK

           ...sleigh.

          Jack is understandably gob-smacked, so much so that he almost

          gets knocked over by one of the reindeer.

                          JACK

           Whoa!

           Hey! Moi deti, moi deti. Quiet,

           quiet.

          The sleigh comes to a standstill as the Guardians prepare to

          climb inside. Several Yetis are still running around making

          last minute preparations.

                          JACK

           Okay, one ride, but that's it.

          Jack jumps aboard. North smiles knowingly, and climbs

          inside. Sandy hops up into the back seat.

                          NORTH

           Everyone loves the sleigh.

          North grabs the reigns, wrapping them around his arms. He

          turns to see Bunnymund standing there, frozen and unnerved.

                          NORTH (CONT'D)

           Bunny, what are you waiting for?

           Are we ready?

          The Yeti throws his hands up in a fit shaking his head no.

          Sandy, Bunny, and Jack fly back into their seats. Bunny

          clutches the edge of his, terrified. Jack can't help but

          laugh.

                          NORTH

           Out of the way!

          The sleigh heads down a luge-like track. North and Jack are

          North cracks the reigns, the sleigh plummets, an almost

          vertical drop. Sandy grins calmly. Jack loves this.

          Bunnymund - not so much.

           What!?

          Suddenly our heroes find themselves in the midst of mayhem,

          as hundreds of Nightmares and terrified Tooth Fairies jet

          Jack now sees that the Nightmares are actually GULPING DOWN

          the fleeing fairies and flying off with them. It's chaos.

           They're taking the tooth fairies!

          Jack looks up to see a lone fairy with a Nightmare snapping

          at its heels. Jack leaps into the air and rescues it before

          the Nightmare can snatch it away.

          Jack lands back in the sleigh. He opens his hand to reveal

          Baby Tooth, who's shaking with fear.

          SEVERAL TOOTH BOXES spill out of the split Nightmare and rain

           They, they took my fairies! And

           the teeth! All of them!

           Everything is gone! Everything.

          Only then does it hit her. Tooth's wings drop in defeat.

          She's completely lost amidst the devastation. The Guardians

          rush to comfort her. Jack stays behind as Baby Tooth pops

          out from the hood of his tunic and flies over toward Tooth.

                          TOOTH

           Oh thank goodness! One of you is

           alright!

           PITCH (O.S.)

           I have to say, this is very, very

           exciting.

          Pitch's voice echoes across the open chamber. They look up to

          see Pitch, standing high above them with a satisfied smile.

                          PITCH

           The Big Four, all in one place.

           I'm a little star-struck.

                          (BEAT)

           Did you like my show on the globe,

           North? Got you all together,

           didn't I?

          Tooth darts after Pitch, but he escapes into the shadows.

                          TOOTH

           Pitch, you have got thirty seconds

           to return my fairies!

           PITCH (O.S.)

           Or what?

          Tooth follows the sound of Pitch's voice and finds him near

          one of her tooth box columns.

                          PITCH

           You'll stick a quarter under my

           pillow?

                          NORTH

           Why are you doing this?

                          PITCH

           Maybe I want what you have. To be

           believed in.

          Jack takes this in. Pitch moves along the walls and shadows

          of the chamber and emerges from behind a column.

           Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 48.

                          PITCH

           Maybe I'm tired of hiding under

           beds.

                          BUNNYMUND

           Maybe that's where you belong.

                          PITCH

           Ah, go suck an egg, rabbit!

          Bunny looks down past the edge of the platform to find Pitch

          upside down, staring him in the face. Pitch disappears again.

           PITCH (O.S.)

           Hang on, is that...Jack Frost?

                          (LAUGHS)

           Since when are you all so chummy?

                          JACK

           We're not.

                          PITCH

           Oh good.

          Jack turns and sees Pitch standing in the middle of a column.

                          PITCH

           A neutral party. Then I'm going to

           ignore you. But, you must be used

           to that by now.

                          BUNNYMUND

           Pitch! You shadow sneaking rat-

           bag! Come here!

          Bunny goes after Pitch, but he disappears and reemerges on an

          opposite column. Tooth spots him, grabs one of Bunny's

          boomerangs and flies at Pitch in a rage...

                          TOOTH

           Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

          Pitch looks at Tooth with a smile and before she can reach

          him, a huge Nightmare darts out of hiding and rears up at

          her. Tooth falls back. Baby Tooth hides in Jack's tunic.

                          PITCH

                          (SOOTHING)

           Whoa! Hey, easy, girl. Easy.

          Pitch draws a wisp of black sand from Onyx's mane, twirls it

          in his palm, and turns toward Sandy.

           Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 49.

                          PITCH

           Look familiar, Sandman? Took me a

           while to perfect this little trick.

           Turning dreams into Nightmares.

          Pitch notices the shocked Guardians.

                          PITCH

           Don't be nervous, it only riles

           them up more. They smell fear you

           know.

                          BUNNYMUND

           What fear? Of you!? No one's been

           afraid of you since the Dark Ages!

          Pitch's eyes flash with anger. But then he smiles.

                          PITCH

                          (NOSTALGIC)

           Oh, the Dark Ages.

          EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

          A parent and her two children, huddled around a campfire,

          scream as a shadow, resembling Pitch, washes over them. It

          makes its way up the side of a mountain to reveal Pitch,

          smiling as he stares up at the moon.

           PITCH (V.O.)

                          (NOSTALGIC)

           Everyone frightened. Miserable.

           Such happy times for me. Oh, the

           power I wielded!

          EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK - CONTINUOUS

           PITCH (V.O.)

           But then the Man in the Moon chose

           you to replace my fear with your

           wonder and light!

          North's sleigh flies in front of the moon. Tooth and her

          fairies flit by while SANDY's Dreamsand dances across the sky

          and Bunny leaps across rooftops.

           PITCH (V.O.)

           Lifting their hearts! And giving

           them hope!

           Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 50.

          Pitch, thinner and weaker than he is now, slips back into the

          shadows after children run through him while playing in the

          streets, laughing as they go.

           PITCH (V.O.)

           Meanwhile, everyone wrote me off as

           just a bad dream! "Oh, there's

           nothing to be afraid of! There's

           no such thing as the Boogeyman!"

          BACK TO THE TOOTH PALACE

          Pitch leans toward the Guardians, showing nothing but

          contempt.

                          PITCH (CONT'D)

           Well that's all about to change.

          A SOUND behind Pitch: one of the COLUMNS of the Palace begins

          to crack and crumble, as if decaying. Tooth is stunned...

                          PITCH

           Oh look, it's happening already.

                          JACK

           What is?

          Tooth's eyes widen in shock.

          VIGNETTES OF CHILDREN AROUND THE WORLD

           PITCH (V.O.)

           Children are waking up and

           realizing the Tooth Fairy never

           came.

          Lifting pillows and finding their BABY TEETH still there.

           PITCH (V.O.)

           I mean such a little thing, but to

           a child...

          PULL OUT from the last VIGNETTE, all the way out of TOOTH'S

          WIDE-OPEN EYE, and BACK TO SCENE. Jack, mystified, moves

          closer to Tooth as the palace continues to crumble.

                          JACK

           What's going on?

                          TOOTH

           They, they don't believe in me

           anymore.

           Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 51.

                          PITCH

           Didn't they tell you, Jack? It's

           great being a Guardian -- but

           there's a catch. If enough kids

           stop believing, everything your

           friends protect - wonder, hopes and

           dreams - it all goes away. And

           little by little, so do they.

          Jack's realizes now the magnitude of Pitch's plan.

                          PITCH

           No Christmas, or Easter, or little

           fairies that come in the night.

           There will be nothing. But fear

           and darkness and me! It's your

           turn not to be believed in!

          Bunny throws his boomerangs at Pitch, who quickly ducks out

          of the way as they fly around the chamber columns. Pitch

          then jumps onto the back of Onyx down into the depths of the

          Palace. The Guardians dive after him, followed by Jack.

          Bunny grabs a set of egg bombs and launches them at Pitch,

          exploding seconds before Pitch hits the ground.

          Tooth, deflated, sits on the ground with an empty tooth box

          in her hands. Baby Tooth, resting on a nearby broken tooth

          box, looks to Tooth with concern. Jack walks up and crouches

          down alongside Tooth.

           BUNNYMUND (O.S.)

           Okay, alright I admit it, you were

           right about Pitch.

           NORTH (O.S.)

           This is one time I wish I was

           wrong. But he will pay.

           I'm sorry, about the fairies.

                          TOOTH

           (not her bubbly self)

           You should've seen them. They put

           up such a fight.

                          JACK

           Why would Pitch take the teeth?

                          TOOTH

           It's not the teeth he wanted. It's

           the memories inside them.

                          JACK

                          (BEAT)

           What do you mean?

          Tooth leads Jack across the pond, the water freezing under

          his feet as he walks.

                          TOOTH

           That's why we collect the teeth,

           Jack. They hold the most important

           memories of childhood.

          Tooth directs him to a MURAL, which illustrates this.

                          TOOTH (CONT'D)

           My fairies and I watch over them

           and when someone needs to remember

           what's important, we help them.

          Jack takes a second to admire the immense beauty of the mural

          before him.

                          TOOTH (CONT'D)

           We had everyone's here. Yours too.

                          JACK

           My memories?

                          TOOTH

           From when you were young. Before

           you became Jack Frost.

                          (BEAT)

           Of course you were. We were all

           someone before we were chosen.

                          JACK

           What?

                          (CHUCKLES)

           You should've seen Bunny.

                          BUNNYMUND

           Hey, I told you never to mention

           that!

          Jack, confused, is trying to process all this.

                          JACK

           That night at the pond...I just,

           why I assumed...Are you saying, are

           you saying I had a life before

           that? With a home? And a family?

                          TOOTH

           You really don't remember?

          Jack's expression says it all. Finally the key to all his

          questions.

                          JACK

           All these years, and the answers

           were right here. If I find my

           memories, then I'll know why I'm

           here.

                          (TO TOOTH)

           You have to show me.

          Jack, using his control of the wind, lifts up off the ground

          and flies across the pond.

                          TOOTH

           I...I can't, Jack. Pitch has them.

          Jack floats down onto a rock, overlooking the Guardians.

                          JACK

           Then we have to get them back!

          Suddenly, a patch of Tooth's feathers fall out, and

          disappears. The Guardians eyes fill with worry.

                          TOOTH

           Oh no!

           Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 54.

           And Jack, if you help us, we will

           get you your memories.

          Jack looks to Tooth, who gives him a reassuring smile. Sandy

          gives to enthusiastic thumbs up while Bunny groans. Jack

          looks back to North with a smile.

                          JACK

           Ah, you okay?

                          TOOTH

           Fine...sorry, it's been a really

           How long is a long time?

                          TOOTH

           Ah, four hundred forty years...give

           or take.

          Tooth jerks to attention: suddenly her VIEW ZOOMS IN thru a

          LITTLE GIRL'S BEDROOM WINDOW: a tiny GLOW under her pillow

          marks a freshly planted TOOTH.

          Tooth gasps and her eyes go wide -- she FLIES to the window,

          excited. Jack reacts, looks to Baby Tooth: it's gonna be a

          long night.

                          JACK

           Hmm...

          Jack, cocksure, arrives outside an open window. His smile

          INT. BEDROOM NIGHT

          Tooth reaches under a pillow and pulls out a Tooth with a

           Huh?

          The note shows an arrow, pointing toward the window. He

          Bunny lands on a rooftop, holding a tooth in his paw, and

                          BUNNYMUND

          --and disappears from view. Bunny is now sliding down the

          side of a roof on a sheet of ice. Jack grabs the tooth from

          Bunny's paw as he slides past and holds it high in the air.

                          (LAUGHS)

           Yes!

          Jack holds up the tooth, but within moments a hand snatches

          it. Jack looks to see Sandy waving `bye-bye' as he flies off

          on his Dreamsand cloud.

          Jack, North, Sandy, and Bunny stand proudly. Each one of

          Tooth is overwhelmed by their collective effort.

                          TOOTH

           Wow! You guys collect teeth and

           leave gifts as fast as my fairies.

          Their eyes widen and Tooth is suddenly panic stricken.

                          TOOTH (CONT'D)

           You guys have been leaving gifts,

          EXT. SKYLINE - NIGHT

          The Guardians fly across the night sky only to disappear

          through a snowglobe portal. Nearby, a Nightmare observes as

          the sleigh vanishes. It leaps off the roof, through a drain,

          and down into the sewers.

          The SPY NIGHTMARE flies down into a dark cavernous space.

          Large STEEL CAGES hang all around and trapped inside are the

          MINI TEETH.

          The Nightmare heads toward Pitch, standing at his own GLOBE,

          which is conspicuously covered in lights.

                          PITCH

           The lights...why aren't they going

           out?

          The Nightmare approaches from behind and lets out a soft

          whiney; Pitch stiffens at the news.

                          PITCH

           They're collecting the teeth?

          The MINI TEETH perk up at this, and start twittering

          excitedly, which echoes throughout the lair.

                          PITCH

           Oh pipe down, or I'll stuff a

           pillow with you!

          The Mini Teeth begin to settle down. PITCH looks at the

          Nightmare, frustrated, and scowls. The Nightmare winces and

          disperses into tiny particles.

          A strand of NIGHTMARE SAND from the Nightmare twirls in the

          air, and Pitch twists it with his fingers, turning it into a

          crude image of the SANDMAN.

                          PITCH

           Fine, have your last hurrah. For

          A cool looking ROBOT TOY rests on Jamie's bedside table.

          Jamie is sound asleep in bed. A smile across his face

           Left central incisor, knocked out

           in a freak sledding accident. I

           happened, Jack?

          Jack laughs as he looks at JAMIE'S DRAWING of himself during

          the SNOWBALL FIGHT on the wall. He's midair, blasting his

          friends with snowballs. He smiles and then turns to Tooth.

           Kids, huh?

          He watches as Tooth reaches under the pillow. She hovers

          over Jamie as he stirs in his sleep. A dreamy smile comes

          over her as she gazes down at the sleeping boy.

                          TOOTH

           This was always the part I liked

           No, stop that's the Easter Bunny.

           What are you doing, Abbey? Down!

           Crikey.

          Bunny is off like a shot, the greyhound right on his tail,

           Stop! Sit!

          Sandy, amused, makes a Dreamsand baseball to stop the dog,

          but bobbles it as the dog brushes past.

                          JAMIE

           Down girl, down!

          The others stand out of the way as Bunny and the dog run up

          As Tooth tries to silence the alarm clock, Jack can barely

           Ah!

          As Sandy winds up, the dog suddenly SMACKS right into him.

          The Dreamsand goes flying.

           Hey, this is not proper Tooth Fairy

           behavior!

          North ducks out of the way as the Dreamsand sails toward him.

          The Dreamsand baseball smacks Tooth right in the face and

          explodes into golden dust. Tooth and her fairy fall to the

          ground as a golden tooth takes shape above their heads.

          Streams of Dreamsand make their way around the room.

          Bunny gets a whiff of the golden sand. The image of a carrot

          quickly takes shape in front of his face.

                          BUNNYMUND

           Oh no.

          THUD! Bunny falls over asleep. THUD! So does the dog.

          North tries to scramble out of the way, but there's no escape

           Candy canes...

          He teeters for a moment as Dreamsand candy canes appear

          before him, then falls like a giant Sequoia, landing - THUD! -

          on the end of Jamie's bed, which sends Jamie catapulting

          through the air.

                          JAMIE

           Whoaaaaaaaaaa!

          Luckily he lands -- OOF! -- in Sandy's arms. He starts to

          wake up AGAIN, but Sandy is there with a fistful of sand --

          BOOF! -- and Jamie too is out cold.

          Jack and Sandy look down at the sleeping boy, relieved. Then

          they look around -- a heap of sleeping, snoring bodies.

                          JACK

           Whoops...

          Bunny is snuggled up next to North. A carrot and candy

          canes, made of Dreamsand, hold hands as they dance above

          Bunny and North's head.

          Jack comes down off the dresser and turns to Sandy, who has

          put Jamie back in bed. Sandy lifts North's arm and lets go,

          it's completely limp and falls flat. Sandy smiles at Jack,

          who chuckles.

                          JACK

           Oh, I really wish I had a camera

           right now.

          Sandy eyes suddenly widen. There's a Nightmare behind Jack.

          Jack turns to see A NIGHTMARE staring through the window.

          Without hesitation, Jack jumps out the window after it.

           JACK (O.S.)

          bedroom door opens, and Sophie toddles in. She takes in the

          scene, amused. She toddles over to North, giggling.

          She pokes at his rotund belly. Then she notices something.

          She reaches into his pocket and pulls out a snow globe.

           Bunny! Hop! Hop! Hop!

          Suddenly the snow globe lights up. Sophie's eyes widen as

          she looks at the beautiful vista inside the globe. It's

          Bunny's warren.

          She takes the globe and toddles off for the door, when she

          trips - again - and the snow globe smashes on the floor.

          Sandy, who's riding along on a streak of Dreamsand--

          One of the Nightmares splits off, angling for a BEDROOM

          The Nightmare flies right through the WINDOW and SANDY does

          the same -- the OTHER ONE angles up over the house's ROOF to

          Jack flies through town on the heels of the Nightmare. It

          makes a sharp turn down an alleyway and Jack is quick to

          follow.

          The Nightmare then veers up the wall of the alley and onto a

          ROOFTOP. Jack whips a blast from his staff and HITS the

          Nightmare before it disappears from view.

                          JACK

           HAAAH! I got it!

          Jack jumps up onto the roof and prods the frozen Nightmare

          Jack can barely contain his excitement as he calls out to

          Sandy -- but suddenly Pitch lurches out from behind an air

          Jack blasts a WAVE OF FROST across the rooftop, but Pitch

          easily dodges it, reappearing behind Jack on the adjoining

          rooftop.

                          PITCH

           You made it my fight when you stole

           those teeth.

           Now this is who I'm looking for--

          Before Pitch can finish a DREAMSAND STREAM whips around him,

          forcing him to duck and dodge Sandy's sudden attack.

                          PITCH

           Whoa--??

          Pitch DISPERSES a stream of NIGHTMARE SAND, turning it into a

          gigantic sickle and swings it back at Sandy. Jack ducks,

          avoiding injury as Sandy's pushed back against a ledge.

          Sandy quickly grabs Pitch with another DREAMSAND STREAM and

          yanks him off his feet, slamming him repeatedly against the

          tops of the buildings until finally throwing him off the

          rooftop.

          Pitch bounces off the ground as he crashes into an EMPTY

          STREET. As Sandy dusts his hands and calmly steps off the

          rooftop to follow, Jack looks on, astonished.

           Okay, easy! You can't blame me for

           trying, Sandy. You don't know what

           was stupid of me to mess with your

          Sandy continues forward, grim faced...but suddenly Pitch

          stops cowering and stands up. His tone changes.

           You can have `em back!

          Before Jack and Sandy can react, a Nightmare shoots up

          through a storm drain as several other Nightmares gather in

          the alley behind him.

           You take the ones on the left, I'll

           take the ones on the right?

          Meanwhile, Pitch rises up from off the ground as Onyx takes

          shape underneath him.

          Pitch grabs onto Onyx's mane as it snorts and snarls. He

          then leans forward.

                          PITCH

           Boo!

          Pitch's army of Nightmares begin to charge. Then suddenly,

          the sound of BELLS and REINDEER echo in the distance--

          NORTH'S SLEIGH bursts through the clouds. Jack and Pitch

          look up into the sky as it circles overhead. The sleigh

          turns toward Pitch, only to fly a few feet over his head.

          Pitch turns as it passes over him, slightly confused.

          them to EXPLODE into BLACK SAND.

          Pitch gives a signal and leaps into the air, leading another

          Back in the sleigh, Bunny jumps out and lands on a nearby

          roof.

          Bunny quickly tosses his boomerang which disintegrates every

          Nightmare in its path. Bunny catches the returning

          boomerang, leaps off the roof, and grabs the skids of the

          sleigh as it passes by.

           Ha. Ha. Ha. Come on!

          Jack heads back to the sleigh by dodging two Nightmares as

          they attack. As he continues his descent, Jack is suddenly

          blind sided by another Nightmare, which knocks the staff from

          his hands.

          For a moment, Jack is in a state of panic as he finds himself

          in free fall.

                          JACK

          stone emblem.

          Tooth sets down a candle and stands shoulder to shoulder with

          North and Bunny. The three hold hands in solace.

          The ringing of somber bells can be heard echoing throughout

          the chamber, as we reveal the elves and a yeti ringing the

          elf bells as part of a ceremonial dirge.

          Jack, facing a window, FROSTS OVER THE GLASS with his finger

          to form a symbol of Sandy. North slowly walks up behind him.

                          JACK

           I just, I wish I could've done

           something.

                          NORTH

           Done something? Jack, you stood up

           to Pitch. You saved us.

           I find out who I was?

                          NORTH

           You will. I feel it, in my belly.

          Jack and North approach the globe which is losing lights at

          an alarming rate.

          Jack drifts up closer the globe. He looks at the lights

          going out, then back to the Guardians. There's a nervous

                          BUNNYMUND

           Welcome to the warren--

          Bunny stands before them when suddenly, he shifts his

          attention. He turns, his ears perk up and his nose sniffs

          the air.

                          BUNNYMUND

           Something's up.

          Something's amiss. A faint scream begins to echo from within

          the depths of one of Bunny's egg tunnels. Tiny eggs come

          scuttling out from the tunnel.

          Bunny grabs his boomerang, North draws his sword, and Jack

          readies his staff as the sounds of booming footsteps,

          screams, and the rustling of foliage grows louder.

                          BUNNYMUND

           Ahhhh!

          Bunny begins to charge toward the tunnel. At his side are

          the Guardians, yetis, and sentinel eggs all bellowing their

          loudest battle cries until...Sophie bursts out. All momentum

          comes to a halt.

                          JACK

           Sophie?

          They immediately withdraw their weapons, mildly embarrassed.

          Sophie giggles and immediately runs after one of the elves.

          playing. Sophie pokes her head into a small tunnel.

          Jack walks toward her, forming a SNOWFLAKE, which floats over

          toward Sophie. She tries to grab at it.

          in moss, as thousands of unpainted eggs stream down the side

          of it toward a green meadow. North and Jack stand in the

          midst of it all, slack-jawed, as the eggs rush towards them.

          Baby Tooth joins an elf, who stands alongside an egg at the

          edge of a cliff. The elf pushes the egg over the cliff, into

          the stream, and celebrates with a victory dance.

           BUNNYMUND (V.O.)

           Oh, there will be bathtubs filled

           with my beautiful googies!

          The elf turns just in time to see a stampede of colored eggs

          come barreling toward him. They knock him off the cliff as

          he and the eggs spill into the multi-colored stream below.

          A SPARKLING STREAM

          Colored eggs wade through the water, emerging with SECONDARY

          COLORS and intricate PATTERNS of all kinds.

          An unlucky egg veers off and gets stuck in a WHIRLPOOL. We

          see a hand fish it out to reveal North, who looks at the egg

          curiously. It's now got a SPIRAL PATTERN on it and its

          little LEGS kick madly.

          Jack approaches from behind and makes his way alongside

          Bunny, who holds Sophie in his arms. Its our first real

          Baby Tooth looks to him, worried.

           VOICE FROM A MEMORY (O.S.)

           Jack...

          With that, Jack leaps off the window ledge.

          EXT. BURGESS - A MOMENT LATER

          Jack, carried by the wind, flies across town toward the sound

          of the eerie voice. Baby Tooth follows, trying to keep up.

          Jack takes a moment to orient himself and lands, settling on

          a rotating vent; as the momentum slowly spins him around, the

          voice calls out to him again.

           VOICE FROM A MEMORY (O.S.)

           Jack...

          Jack turns, looks to the woods, and takes off.

          EXT. WOODS - BURGESS - A MOMENT LATER

          Jack and Baby Tooth land in the middle of a thickly wooded

          area. It's spooky. Jack scans the forest when again he

          hears...

           VOICE FROM A MEMORY (O.S.)

           Jack...

          Jack gives chase. He sprints through the thickets and enters

          a clearing only to find the decrepit remains of a rotting

          frame from a child's bed. Very creepy. What would that be

          doing in the woods, and how long has it been here?

                          JACK

           Don't worry, there's still time.

          Baby Tooth desperately tries to get Jack's attention by

          tugging at his tunic, and tweeting desperately.

          Jack takes his staff, and breaks through the damaged frame,

          revealing a hole leading deep underground.

           VOICE FROM A MEMORY (O.S.)

           Jack...

          What to do? Jack jumps down the hole, reluctantly followed

          by Baby Tooth.

          SEQ. 2100 - PITCH TRICKS JACK

          INT. PITCH'S TUNNELS

          Jack continues along a long dark tunnel with Baby Tooth close

          behind. Eventually the labyrinth opens up to reveal a huge

          underground cavern. Baby Tooth continues to tug at Jack's

          tunic.

                          JACK

           I have to find out what that is.

          INT. PITCH'S INNER SANCTUM - CONTINUOUS

          Jack can't believe his eyes. Dozens of huge bird cages

          hanging from the ceiling, and in them are the mini tooth

          fairies. They see Jack, and immediately perk up, tweeting

          and flitting like crazy.

          Jack jumps up onto one of the cages, then quickly leaps and

          holds onto the side of another one.

           As I can --

          Jack looks down and sees the tooth drawers from Tooth's

          Palace. Mounds of them heaped to the ceiling. And inside

          the drawers are the missing baby teeth. He drops down to a

          mound and begins rummaging through the drawers, looking at

          the names on the boxes.

          In an instant he forgets his duties, and the fairies, and the

          Guardians and everything except those teeth, and the chance

          to finally get his memory back.

          The cavern suddenly goes darker than it already was. Jack

          finally looks up, as a shadow of Pitch crawls up a nearby

          column.

           PITCH (O.S.)

           Looking for something?

          Jack swings around with his staff, shooting off a blast of

          ice, but Pitch isn't there. Jack takes off, following the

          sound of Pitch's cackle as it echoes throughout the chamber.

          Jack rounds a corner as he sees Pitch's shadow glide across

          the walls into a shadowed corridor.

           PITCH (O.S.)

           Don't be afraid, Jack. I'm not

           going to hurt you.

          Jack continues along a shadowed corridor.

                          JACK

           Afraid?

          Jack sees Pitch on a bridge across the cavern and heads after

          him.

                          JACK (CONT'D)

           I'm not afraid of you!

                          PITCH

           Maybe not. But you are afraid of

           something.

          Jack steadily approaches, cautious and alert.

                          JACK

           You think so, huh?

           Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 89.

                          PITCH

           I know so. It's the one thing I

           always know.

          Pitch finally turns to face Jack.

                          PITCH (CONT'D)

           People's greatest fears. Yours is

           that no one will ever believe in

           you.

          Panic flashes in Jack's eyes. As he backs away, the chamber

          fills with shadows, and Jack is spun around. He's

          disoriented as he thuds into a wall, which flips to reveal

          that it's actually the ground.

          Pitch, unseen now, chuckles.

          Jack's unsure of where he is. He looks back to see the

          cavern entrance -- he's right back where he started.

           PITCH (O.S.)

           And worst of all, you're afraid

           you'll never know why. Why you?

           Why were you chosen...to be like

           this?

          Jack discovers that the entrance has been blocked with bricks

          as Pitch's shadow encroaches on him.

                          PITCH

           Well fear not, for the answer to

           that...

          Pitch is now directly in front of Jack, holding out a tooth

          box.

                          PITCH (CONT'D)

           Is right here.

          Jack's eyes widen at the sight - the face of a young boy

          etched into the box, and under it is the name "Jack Frost."

                          PITCH

           Do you want them, Jack? Your

           memories?

          He holds them out to Jack. Jack stares, fighting the impulse

          to grab them. He closes his eyes, struggling to make a

          decision, but when he opens them again, Pitch has

          disappeared.

          Pitch's shadow moves across the pillars of the cavern.

          Jack heads down a corridor, cast shadows from the Mini Tooth

          cages everywhere.

           PITCH (O.S.)

           Everything you wanted to know...

          Pitch's face moves in and out of the shadows over the

          following.

                          PITCH

           ...in this little box.

          Every time Jack turns, Pitch disappears. It's like Jack's

          trapped in a fun house.

          Multiple Pitch shadows have appeared on the wall around Jack.

          They're closing in on him.

                          PITCH

           want to grab them, and fly off with

           them. But you're afraid of what

           the Guardians will think.

          Jack's breath quickens. He's been pushed into a corner.

                          PITCH

           You're afraid of disappointing

           them.

                          (SMILES)

           Well let me ease your mind about

           one thing. They'll never accept

           you. Not really.

          The shadows have overcome Jack.

                          JACK

           (trying to scramble away)

           Stop it! Stop it!

          Almost reluctantly, the shadows back away and Pitch appears

          before Jack.

                          PITCH

           After all, you're not one of them.

          Jack aims his staff at Pitch.

           You make a mess wherever you go.

           Why, you're doing it right now.

          Pitch tosses the box to Jack, who instinctively catches it.

          Jack looks up. Terror comes into Jack's eyes, as he

          realizes...

                          JACK

           What did you do?

                          PITCH

           More to the point Jack, what did

           you do?

          Pitch begins to back away, becoming one with the darkness,

          laughing as he disappears. Jack charges towards him only to

          be swallowed whole by one of Pitch's black holes.

          Jack turns around. Suddenly, his eyes fill with dread as he

          strewn about, forming a path toward the light at the end of

          the tunnel.

          Bunny checks the eggs in his basket, then looks back toward

          and North, both of whom look away, too hurt by Jack. He

          looks at them with a pained expression. This is exactly what

          Pitch said would happen.

          Jack reaches into his pocket, pulls out the tiny Russian

          nesting doll that North had given him, drops the doll to the

          ground, and takes off.

           Ah man, seriously.

                          JAMIE

           What's happened to you guys?

                          CALEB

           It was a dream. You should be

           happy you still get dreams like

           that and not...

          They begin to turn away from him.

          Pippa's the lone straggler. She looks tired, depressed, and

          hands Jamie her basket as she leaves.

                          PIPPA

           Forget it, Jamie. There's just no

           Easter this year.

           CALEB (O.S.)

           I can't believe this.

                          JAMIE

           He really is real!

          Pippa walks away, trailing the others. Jamie doesn't know

          what to believe. He hangs his head and looks into the Easter

          basket, it's empty.

                          JAMIE (CONT'D)

           I know he is.

          INT. NORTH POLE - GLOBE ROOM - DAY

          Yetis stare at the globe of belief, in shock as more and more

          lights begin to fad away. We push in toward Antarctica as we-

                          DISSOLVE TO:

          SEQ. 2304 - JACK IN ANTARCTICA

          EXT. ICEBERG - ANTARCTIC CIRCLE - DAY

          Jack runs to the edge of a floating iceberg, ready to throw

          his tooth box into the ocean. He resists, looking down at

          the box as he clutches it in his hand. He's never been more

          alone in his life.

           PITCH (O.S.)

           I thought this might happen.

          Pitch is revealed, standing not far behind Jack.

                          PITCH (CONT'D)

           They never really believed in you.

           I was just trying to show you that.

           But I understand.

           Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 97.

          Jack whips around and shoots a burst of frost at Pitch, but

          it's quickly deflected by the Nightmare sand.

                          JACK

           You don't understand anything!

          Jack continues to attack, lashing out with his staff. Pitch

          blocks the attacks of ice and frost -- his control over the

          Nightmare sand has gained considerable strength.

                          PITCH

                          (SHOUTING)

           No? I don't know what it's like to

           be cast out?

          Pitch strikes back, putting Jack on the defense. Jack jumps

          in the air. Their show of force escalates until they're

          shrouded in a blanket of snow, ice, and wind. As the wind

          and snow settle, Jack looks around stern and alert.

           PITCH (O.S.)(CONT'D)

           To not be believed in. To long for

           a family.

          Jack turns around to find Pitch. There's a look of

          compassion on Jack's face as he listens.

                          PITCH (CONT'D)

           All those years in the shadows I

           thought, no one else knows what

           this feels like. But now I see I

           was wrong.

          They lock eyes. A moment of true connection between them.

                          PITCH (CONT'D)

           We don't have to be alone, Jack.

          This isn't a trick Pitch is making a real offer here.

                          PITCH (CONT'D)

           I believe in you. And I know

           children will too.

                          JACK

           In me?

                          PITCH

           Yes! Look at what we can do!

          Pitch gestures to a fantastical ice and nightmare "sculpture"

          that was created (off-screen) when Jack attacked him.

           Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 98.

                          PITCH (CONT'D)

           What goes together better than cold

           and dark?

          Jack looks at the fractured reflections of themselves cast in

          the icy sculpture.

                          PITCH (CONT'D)

           We can make them believe. We'll

           give them a world where everything,

           everything is...

          Jack turns to face Pitch.

                          JACK

                          (DEADPANS)

           Pitch black...

          Pitch, realizing how this looks, clarifies...

                          PITCH

           And Jack Frost too. They'll

           believe in both of us.

          Jack stares at him, considering the offer. Then finally...

                          JACK

           No, they'll fear both of us. And

           that's not what I want.

          Jack turns and walks away.

                          JACK (CONT'D)

           Now for the last time, leave me

           alone.

          Pitch looks confused and hurt. This is not the response he

          was expecting. Then...his eyes flame with anger. He made

          himself vulnerable, and Jack rejected him. No more

          negotiating now.

                          PITCH

           Very well. You want to be left

           alone? Done. But first...

          Suddenly Jack hears a familiar twitter. Pitch reaches into

          his coat to pull out...

                          JACK

           Baby Tooth!

          Jack charges forward. There's terror in Baby Tooth's eyes.

          She squeaks as Pitch clenches her tight with his fist.

                          PITCH

           The staff, Jack.

          Jack settles and the winds and snow subsides.

                          PITCH (CONT'D)

           You have a bad habit of

           interfering. Now hand it over.

                          (BEAT)

           And I'll let her go.

                          BABY TOOTH

           (twitters - Don't give it to him!)

          Baby Tooth struggles to get loose, but Pitch only tightens

          his grip. She can hardly breathe. Jack has no choice.

          Jack...hands over...the staff.

          Pitch twirls the staff.

                          JACK

           (re: Baby Tooth)

           Alright, now let her go.

                          PITCH

           No. You said you wanted to be

           alone.

                          (BEAT)

           So be alone!

          Baby Tooth squirms until she's finally able to peck Pitch in

          the hand with her beak. Pitch shrieks and throws Baby Tooth

          in the air and down into the mouth of a crevasse.

                          JACK

           No!

          Jack, enraged, can't believe what he's seeing. Pitch lifts

          the staff, and breaks it over his knee, cracking it in two.

          Light EXPLODES from the staff and terror comes into Jack's

          eyes, clutching his chest as if in pain.

          Suddenly, Pitch sends a burst of Nightmare sand, blasting

          Jack and slamming him into the iceberg wall behind him. As

          the ice cracks, Jack comes loose and falls forward into the

          chasm below.

          Pitch looks down into the ice fissure chuckling. He throws

          the broken shards of Jack's staff down into the crevasse and

          casually walks away, disappearing on the horizon.

          SEQ. 2308 - JACK'S MEMORY

          EXT. ICE FISSURE - NIGHT

          It's cold and dark down here, and Jack is more alone than

          he's ever been. Battered from the fall, Jack slowly looks up

          and notices Baby Tooth, lying lifelessly on the ground.

                          JACK

           Baby Tooth!

          He pulls himself to her and cradles her in his hands.

                          JACK

           You alright?

          Baby Tooth nods, but she's hurt, and cold. Jack does his

          best to shield her from the cold.

                          JACK

           Sorry, all I can do is keep you

           cold.

          Jack sits up and holds Baby Tooth in his hands.

                          JACK

           Pitch was right - I make a mess of

           everything.

          Jack is devastated. Baby Tooth's never seen him like this;

          it's heart breaking...then she gets a thought. Her

          expression hardens with determination.

          She wriggles deep into his pocket.

                          JACK

           Hey?

          Jack leans back and begins to close his eyes when he hears

                         SOMETHING --

           VOICE FROM A MEMORY

           Jack... Jack...

           -- and then he FEELS something. Looks down: There's a SOFT,

          GOLDEN GLOW coming from his pocket.

          Jack jumps, taken aback. He reaches in and pulls out the

          TOOTH BOX -- it's pulsing with light.

           VOICE FROM A MEMORY

           Jack...

           Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 101.

          Baby Tooth gives him a reassuring look.

          Baby Tooth motions to the box, then looks back at Jack. Jack

          reaches to touch the box, but as he does its top magically

          UNFOLDS to reveal a handful of BABY TEETH - then the box and

          everything else glows BRIGHT WITH INTENSE LIGHT -

          The WALLS of the fissure seem to suddenly fall away. In

          brief FLASHES we see: The COLONIAL SETTLEMENT Jack visited.

          Jack walks toward the woods with his sister. His mother,

          face unseen, calls out to him.

                          JACK'S MOTHER

           Be careful.

          Jack shakes his head like he's heard it a million times but

          never pays it any mind.

          eyes. He is staring directly at the camera, a look of...what

          is it? It's hard to read but it's VERY intense. We keep

          pulling back to reveal him dressed as we first saw him in

          16th century clothes. Behind him, dark winter trees and snow

          come in to focus.

           It's okay. It's okay. Don't look

           down, just look at me.

          Jack reaches slowly down and removes the second of two

          rudimentary ice-skates, leaving him BAREFOOT on the surface

          of a familiar FROZEN pond. And now we see what he sees, a

          girl of about FOUR (with an uncanny resemblance to Jamie's

          sister Sophie) stands in her skates, rooted to the spot. A

          spider's web of cracks emanates from where she stands.

                          JACK'S SISTER

           Jack, I'm scared.

          CRACCKKK! The ice below her splinters more. She wobbles as

          it starts to separate.

                          JACK

           I know, I know...but you're gonna

           be alright. You're not gonna fall

           in. We're gonna have a little fun

           instead.

                          JACK'S SISTER

           No we're not!

                          JACK

           Would I trick you?

                          JACK'S SISTER

           (fighting back tears)

           Yes! You always play tricks!

           Well, alright. Well, not, not this

           time. I promise. I promise,

           you're gonna be...you're gonna be

           fine.

          Jack fixes her gaze...holds it...there's nothing but the two

          of them.

                          JACK

           You have to believe in me.

          Jack's sister pauses a moment, then smiles through her fear.

          And just like that, Jack's demeanor changes. A light is

          switched on inside him and the last thing that could be

          happening is what is actually happening.

           to play Hopscotch! Like we play

          Jack's sister looks more reassured.

                          JACK (CONT'D)

           It's as easy as...one...whoaaaa...

          And Jack shows his sister the first leap, but mugs for her,

          almost losing his balance then catching himself. She laughs.

                          JACK (CONT'D)

           Two...

           (the next jump)

           Three!

          He turns toward her with his arms spread out.

                          JACK

           Alright...

          He reaches down to pick up a familiar-looking stick lying on

          the ice. He extends it towards her --

                          JACK (CONT'D)

           Now it's your turn.

          Jack's sister looks down. She is trying to gather her

          courage. Jack, never breaking his gaze with her,

                          JACK (CONT'D)

                          (SOFTLY)

          She hops, wobbling, but catching her balance.

                          JACK

           That's it, that's it...two...

          She's almost there, Jack's staff just beyond her reach.

                          JACK

           Three.

          She grabs hold of Jack's staff and in one massive effort he

          slings her with all his might to safety. But the movement

          propels him into the cracked ice. He looks up to see his

          sister safe - smiles - and then plunges into the dark cold

          water.

           Jack!

          Jack falls back into the icy water. SPLASH!

                         UNDERWATER

          We're looking up at the hole in the ice, descending into the

          dark icy depths...then THE FULL MOON appears from behind the

          clouds as Jack's hands claw through the water towards it, but

          it's helpless. The MOON glows bright...brighter...

          Jack's BODY begins to glow, bathed in MOONLIGHT. PUSH IN on

          his FACE, becoming brighter and brighter until his brown hair

          turns white and JACK'S BRIGHT BLUE EYES flash open --

          EXT. MOUNTAIN FISSURE - NIGHT

          The icy walls rush back in as we pull out from Jack, reeling

          from the memory. He sees Baby Tooth.

                          JACK

           Did you -- did you see that?

          She shakes her head `no', tweets `of course not'!

                          JACK

           It -- it was me! I had a family!

           I had a sister!

          His excitement suddenly turns to realization.

                          JACK

           I saved her!

          He looks up at the opening above. The MOON peeks out from

          behind the clouds.

                          JACK

           (whispers up to Manny)

           That's why you chose me.

                          (TO HIMSELF)

           I'm, I'm a Guardian.

          The Moon seems to shine a little BRIGHTER. Baby Tooth tries

          to take flight but she sputters and lands back in the palm of

          Jack's hand.

          Jack looks down at the two halves of his staff, and picks

          them up. He tries to fit them back together, but nothing

          happens. He tries again, this time using every ounce of

          strength left in him. Baby Tooth watches, her eyes widening

          as, a SPARK of blue light shoots off the staff.

          Jack continues to push, until a the icy blue light spreads

          and melds the two ends of the staff back together. Jack

          smiles.

          EXT. ICEBERG - DAY

          Suddenly Jack, with Baby Tooth tucked safely in his tunic,

          SHOOTS UP out of the fissure, high into the sky and through

          the clouds.

                          JACK

           Come on Baby Tooth! I owe you one.

          from CAGE to CAGE, opening them as he goes. Jack opens

                          JACK

           Come on, let's go.

          Jack looks around and notices that all of the Minis are still

          in their cages.

                          JACK (CONT'D)

           What's wrong?!

          The fairies are just standing around, listless.

                          JACK (CONT'D)

           None of you can fly?

          Baby Tooth directs Jack's attention to the Globe at the base

          of Pitch's lair.

          INT. NORTH POLE - FACTORY FLOOR

          A Yeti very carefully sets the last of a group of newly

          painted red robot dolls on a shelf. He breathes a sigh of

          relief.

          Suddenly, the entire factory begins to shake, knocking the

          robot doll to the ground. He dives after it, juggles it in

          the air, and catches it just before it hits the ground.

          Suddenly, streaks of BLACK SAND whoosh up into and around the

          factory. The dark sand snakes its way up and around the

          globe, causing the Yetis and Elves to scatter and knocking

          TOYS to the floor.

          The Yetis and Elves look up in horror as the black sand, now

          covering the globe, gives rise to Pitch, who stands before

          them cackling.

                          PITCH

           You're all free to go! We won't be

           needing any Christmas toys this

           year, thank you! Nor ever again!

          The yeti with the robot dolls sinks his head and sighs in

          defeat.

          INT. PITCH'S LAIR - NIGHT

          Jack lands on the ground, now standing before PITCH'S GLOBE --

          and it looks almost completely devoid of light.

                          JACK

           They're all going out...

          INT. NORTH POLE - DAY

          Pitch is practically dancing across North's globe, he's so

          giddy, counting down as the last few lights go dark.

          His eyes widen as he snaps his fingers with anticipation and

          glee. All of his hard work and planning - finally paying

          off!

          Pitch stares down at the one last light, waiting for it to go

          out. He snaps his fingers a few more times. Still nothing.

          His smile fades. His face goes cold as he realizes...

                          PITCH

                          (TO HIMSELF)

           One.

          INT. PITCH'S LAIR - NIGHT

          Jack jumps up onto the globe to closely inspect the last

          light. The light is brought into full view. Jack smiles.

                          JACK

           Jamie!

          We're tight on the globe, where the LAST LIGHT flickers. We

          PUSH IN to the light and...

          EXT. BURGESS - NIGHT

          ...down onto the streets of Burgess. We race over the town

          until we land on Jamie's house, a single light shining from

          SEQ. 2000 - JACK AND JAMIE

          INT. JAMIE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Jamie is sitting up in bed, talking to an old stuffed rabbit,

          and whispering.

                          JAMIE

           Okay look, you and I are obviously

           at what they call a crossroads, so

           here's what's gonna happen -

          Jack appears outside Jamie's window and moves closer to get a

          better look.

                          JAMIE (CONT'D)

           If it wasn't a dream and if you are

           real, then you have to prove it.

           Like right now.

           Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 108.

          Jamie waits. He looks around expectantly. Jack looks on

          from outside the window, wondering if anything will happen.

                          JAMIE

           (desperation creeping in)

           I've believed in you for a long

           time, okay? Like my whole life in

           fact. So you kinda owe me now.

          Jamie picks up his stuffed rabbit and holds it close.

                          JAMIE (CONT'D)

           You don't have to do much, just a

           little sign so I know. Anything.

                          (BEAT)

           Anything at all.

          He waits. It's excruciating.

                          JAMIE

                          (A WHISPER)

           I knew it.

          Jamie lets the stuffed animal fall to the floor. Jack comes

          into the room and watches as the light slowly fades from

          Jamie's eyes, disbelief setting in.

          Jack doesn't know what to do. He takes a moment to

          concentrate, then enters the room.

          Then, Jamie notices the window as the panes of glass freeze

          over. The image of an Easter egg suddenly appears...

                          JAMIE

           (seeing the window)

           Huh?

          Jamie looks down at the stuffed rabbit on the floor. He can

          barely comprehend what he's seeing. Jamie looks back to the

          window as more of the window panes frost over. Jamie's eyes

          get huge with amazement.

                          JAMIE

           He's real.

          Jack, excited, continues to exert himself trying to bring

          life to his drawing. And when he does, the frost rabbit

          comes leaping off of the window.

                          JAMIE

           Whoa...

          The rabbit hops around Jamie's room, bursting like a snowball

          over Jamie's head, the snowflakes sprinkling down on him.

           Whoa!

          Jack is as amazed as Jamie. But Jamie's amazement turns to

          confusion.

                          JAMIE

           Snow?

          A snowflake lands on the tip of Jamie's nose. The snowflake

          glows a magic blue. And in that moment a light comes into

          Jamie's eyes - an idea starts to take hold.

                          JAMIE

                          (WHISPER)

                          (BEAT)

           You said...

          Jamie turns around and suddenly his eyes go wide...

                          JAMIE

           Jack Frost.

                          JACK

           That's right! But-but that's me!

           Jack Frost! That's my name! You

           said my name!

          Jamie's mouth drops open. Only then does Jack realize...

                          JACK

           Wait, can you hear me?

                          (JAMIE NODS)

           Can you... Can you see me?

                          (JAMIE NODS)

           He sees me. He sees me!

          Jack leaps for joy, and the room suddenly explodes with snow.

          Jamie can't believe it.

           and you remember when you went

          Jamie's mom calls from down the hall...

           Jamie, who are you talking to?

          Suddenly, the sound of thunder and North's sleigh as Jack and

           Whoa, whoa, whoa...

          NORTH AND TOOTH arrive on the sleigh completely out of

          control, and crash land outside Jamie's house.

          The reindeer are separated from the sleigh and run into the

          woods. A disheveled Tooth and North emerge from the

          wreckage.

                          NORTH

           Ah, moi deti! Come back!

          As North stands, his back suddenly gives out.

           North! Are you okay?

          Tooth falters and falls to the ground.

                          JACK

          They greet each other with a smile as North draws near.

           Same as you.

          Jack looks off to the side as Jamie appears from out of his

          backyard.

                          NORTH

           The last light!

                          JAMIE

           Wow! It is you! I mean it is you!

                          NORTH

           Jack! He sees you!

          Jack puts a protective hand on Jamie's shoulder. Jamie looks

          up at him and smiles. Jack and North exchange a look.

                          JACK

           Wait, but, where's Bunny?

                          NORTH

           Losing Easter took its toll on all

           of us. Bunny most of all.

          Jack's face goes pale. North lowers his head in sadness.

          Then a twitchy-nosed LITTLE BUNNY appears on the sleigh.

                          JACK

           Oh...no...

                          JAMIE

                          (CHUCKLES)

           That's the Easter Bunny?

           Now somebody sees me! I mean,

           where were you about an hour ago,

           mate?

                          JAMIE

           What happened to him? He used to be

           huge and cool! And now he's cute.

          Jamie gently tickles Bunny under his chin. Bunny begins

          involuntarily thumping his paw.

                          BUNNYMUND

           Oh, that's good.

          Bunny catches himself and pushes Jamie's hands away.

                          (TO JACK)

           Did you tell him to say that?

           (hops over to Jack)

           That's it! Let's go! Me and you!

           Come on!

                          JAMIE

           No! Actually he told me you were

           real. Just when I started to think

           that maybe you weren't.

          Bunny stops. Did he just hear that right?

                          BUNNYMUND

           He made you believe? In me?

          A moment of reconciliation between them, broken by the sounds

          of THUNDER. The Guardians look to the sky to see Pitch

          enveloped by dark clouds as he stares down at them from atop

          a writhing mass of Nightmare sand.

                          JACK

           (to the others)

           Get Jamie out of here.

                          NORTH

           Be careful, Jack!

          Jack leaps into the air, and goes flying directly at Pitch.

          Meanwhile, the Guardians take Jamie to find shelter.

                         ON PITCH

          His eyes flash with anger at see Jack coming toward him.

                          PITCH

           Jack Frost! Let's end this, shall

           we?

          Pitch sighs as he rolls his eyes and flies down to meet Jack

          head on.

          EXT. STREETS OF BURGESS - NIGHT

          Jack sends a blast of ice and frost at Pitch as he barrels

          toward him. Pitch easily absorbs the attack with his

          Nightmare sand.

                          PITCH

           That little trick doesn't work on

           me anymore.

          Jack's plan backfires as Pitch charges ahead and unleashes a

          roaring fury of Nightmare sand that knocks Jack out of the

          sky.

          EXT. STREETS OF BURGESS - MOMENTS LATER

          Jamie and the Guardians do their best to avoid the patrolling

          Nightmares. North struggles to keep up.

                          BUNNYMUND

           Quick, this way this way!

          Bunny leads them down an alley, but it's no use.

                          BUNNYMUND (CONT'D)

           Dead end. Other way other way!

          Jack suddenly falls from the sky, lands on a dumpster, and

          falls limp to the ground. THUD! The others turn their

          attention and wince.

                          JAMIE

           Jack!

          They rush to Jack and help him to his feet.

          North and Tooth trade looks of concern. Then, a menacing

          chuckle. The Guardians keep a watchful eye as Nightmare

          shadow streaks across the alley.

           Very well. There are other ways to

           snuff out a light.

          Bulbs start bursting as the arm of a shadow moves across the

          remaining lights in the alley. Terror in Jamie's eyes. What

          does that mean?

          Jamie gives Jack a questioning look. What does Jack have in

          BOOF! A snowball suddenly hits Pitch in the face. Two

          Nightmares look at each, unsure how to react. Jamie can't

          help but snicker and North lets out a chuckle.

          Jack looks around the alley. He spots a wooden crate, a

          trash can lid and a discarded wok amidst a pile of trash.

           It's over Pitch! There's no place

           to hide.

          Pitch give them a wry smile and quickly descends into the

          shadows, casting multiple versions of himself along the alley

          walls.

          Suddenly, in their moment of distraction, Pitch rises up

          behind Jack, his Nightmare sand AXE in hand.

           Jack, look out!

          The other Guardians look on in horror as--

          A golden whip wraps itself round Pitch's hands. We follow

          the whip to reveal Sandy, coalescing from the funnel cloud of

          Dreamsand. He gives Pitch a look, wags his finger, and then

          uppercuts him into the air.

          Sandy looks off to the side to where Jamie and his friends

          have gathered. He forms a Dreamsand hat and tips the cap to

          Jamie. Jamie, gleeful, waves back to Sandy as his friends

          stand behind him in awe.

          Sandy then looks to his whip and tugs on it, slamming Pitch

          into the ground and knocking him out. The Guardians cheer as

          they welcome Sandy's return.

          Pitch runs through the shadows in terror. He comes crashing

          through the trees of the forest, and out onto the ice of the

          pond. He looks over his shoulder to see if the Guardians are

          on his tail, when BOOM! He runs smack into North's chest.

          Pitch slips on the ice, and falls backwards. He looks up to

          He tries to run, but it's impossible to get his footing on

          the ice. He falters, and is swept up in the stampede of

          Nightmares. The streaks of black whip and latch themselves

          onto Pitch as the black cloud carries him through the forest.

          Tooth comes flying in to give Jack a hug. She lifts him off

          Jamie realizes what's about to happen.

                          JAMIE

           You're leaving? But, what if Pitch

           comes back?

          Jack looks back at Jamie, who seems wistful and worried.

                          JAMIE (CONT'D)

           What if we stop believing again?

           If I can't see you --

          Jack kneels down to look Jamie in the eye.

                          JACK

           Hey, hey, slow down, slow down.

           You telling me you stop believing

           in the moon when the sun comes up?

                          JAMIE

           (considers, then)

           No.

                          JACK

           Okay, well do you stop believing in

           the sun when clouds block it out?

                          JAMIE

                          (SMILES)

           No.

                          JACK

           We'll always be there, Jamie. And

           now...we'll always be here.

           (points to Jamie's heart)

           Which kind of makes you a Guardian

           too.

          Jamie smiles. Jack stands up and heads toward the sleigh.

          Jamie's friends stand off to the side rubbing their eyes as

          they become drowsy.

                          (WALLA)

           I can't keep my eyes open. I think

           I gotta go home. Let's go home.

           What time is it? I'm sleepy.

                          JAMIE

           Jack!

          Jamie runs over and wraps his arms around Jack. For a

          moment, Jack's astonished and then gives Jamie a warm

          embrace. Jack stands up and gets in the sleigh with the rest

          of the Guardians.

                          NORTH

           Hyah!

          Jack and the Guardians look toward the kids as the sleigh

          takes off. Jamie RUNS behind the sleigh, following Jack. In

          spite of it all, he doesn't want to let go. The sleigh takes

          off into the sky. Jamie stops unable to follow.

           JACK (V.O.)

           My name is Jack Frost. And I'm a

           Guardian. How do I know that?

           Because the moon told me so. And

           when the moon tells you something,

           believe it.

          Jack moves to the back of the sleigh as the Guardians pat him

          on the back. Jack smiles...and forms a snowflake in his

          hand. For Jamie, for all of us in the theatre. It glides

          off his fingertips and flies toward camera as we...
