               THE SURFER KING

       1       EXT. EARLY MORNING. - CUSTOMER SERVICE KIOSK                          1

               JAFFA, a Jamaican looking fellow in his early 20's, arrives

               at Water World, carrying a dusty cardboard box.

               There are a few workers milling about, setting up the park

               for opening. He passes EDDIE, a 25-something grounds worker

               with Down's Syndrome.

                                     JAFFA

                         Eddie!

                                   EDDIE

                             (smiling, nodding)

                         Jaffa.

               They do a hand slap maneuver that they have obviously worked

               out some time in the past. JAFFA proceeds up to the Customer

               Relations Kiosk, plops the box on the counter, and enters the

               kiosk. We see him open the box, it is full of CD's.

               He pulls winter covers off of an overhead area to reveal a CD

               player and amplifiers. He starts pushing buttons he's pushed

               a thousand times, and lights come on. He pulls down a

               microphone, and clicks a button to see if it works.

               He reaches into the box of CDs and pulls one out. We see it

               is Sheryl Crow. He gets the CD, examines it, and pops it

               into the CD player.

               He once again picks the microphone and flips the switch as he

               pushes the "play" button on the CD player.

               His voice echoes through the park.         "Soak up the Sun" begins

               playing.

                                   JAFFA

                             (smiling)

                         Ladies and Gentlemen, Water World will be

                         open in

                             (checking his watch)

                         twenty-six hours and forty-three minutes.

               GFX - OPENING CREDITS BEGIN

       2       EXT EARLY MORNING - THUNDER BAY                                    2

               BIG MIKE, the park's owner/manager - a 50-something man who

               is portly and bald, and RICHARD THOMPSON, head lifeguard and

               another GUARD are on the east side of Thunder Bay.

               There is a post with a box on top of it that has a winter

               cover on it. The GUARD is standing there with a garden hose

                                                                   Page 2 of 81

               holding it so the water goes into Thunder Bay.

               He is obviously tired, and has been standing there a long

               time. We look back at the massive size of the pool and get

               the joke.

               BIG MIKE and RICHARD pull off the winter cover. The GUARD

               turns to look and the hose turns with him, getting BIG MIKE

               wet. They object and he turns back to filling Thunder Bay.

               RICHARD moves the GUARD to a safe distance.

               BIG MIKE blows the dust off of the box at the top of the

               post, and we see it is a large push button. BIG MIKE looks

               at RICHARD who nods "go ahead" and then pushes the button.

               They both draw back as if something big should happen, but

               nothing. They look at each other and BIG MIKE motions for

               RICHARD to go over to the wall housing the wave tank for the

               pool.

               RICHARD waves OK, and BIG MIKE pushes the button again. When

               nothing happens, RICHARD whacks the side of the tank with his

               closed fist. Suddenly a huge wave rolls out.

               Nodding his approval, BIG MIKE checks off an item in his

               clipboard.

       3       EXT. EARLY MORNING. - DAY   SURFS UP AREA                       3

               We see people working to open the park. The VAIL PRECISION

               LAWN CHAIR DRILL TEAM dressed in Water World uniforms is

               setting and arranging chairs in time to the music. They

               perform precision maneuvers with the chairs, as if rifles,

               and cross each other in a timed march to the music.

       4       EXT. EARLY MORNING. - DAY   FUN HOUSE AREA                      4

               BIG MIKE is standing under the Fun House structure with a

               clipboard. He is talking to RICHARD.

               After talking to BIG MIKE, RICHARD shakes his head

               affirmatively and walks off. He glances up to the two guards

               above, and grins. BIG MIKE is looking at his clipboard. We

               see quickly the large water tank above is spilling water a

               bit, indicating it is full.

               The water tank spills over BIG MIKE drenching him. He stands

               there still, angry for a moment, then thinks better of it

               shaking his head and smiling, takes his pen and checks OK on

               his wet clipboard for the fun house water tank.

       5       EXT. EARLY MORNING. - DAY   FIRST AID SHACK NEAR FUNHOUSE       5

               Two guards are looking down at BIG MIKE below. One guard

               begins motioning as if guiding a crane into place. The other

               guard has his hand poised on a large switch lever.

               GUARD ONE is gesturing more emphatically now, closing his

               hands to indicate "almost there". He closes his hands, and

               GUARD TWO pulls the lever.

       6       EXT. LATER THAT MORNING - DAY   2001 VW BUG                     6

               We are on the road to Water World in Federal Heights,

               Colorado. ROBBIE ZIRPOLLO is riding with his mother CONNIE

               ZIRPOLLO.

                                  ROBBIE

                            (sardonically)

                        Yeah. This is great. I love this plan.

                        Drag me kicking and screaming from my

                        happy home in California to some weird

                        place in Colorado, and say hey, this'll

                        be fun Robbie. Maybe we can go

                        camping....

                                   CONNIE

                         Look, I know you're not happy about this.

                         But it wasn't my idea for your father to

                         have some kind of mid-life crisis and

                         disappear with his secretary to Mexico

                         with our life savings.

                                   ROBBIE

                         "Administrative Assistant." There's no

                         such thing as a secretary anymore.

                                  CONNIE

                        Fine. Administrative Assistant. We

                        couldn't afford to sit around waiting any

                        longer to see if he was coming back. I

                        was able to land a good job here. And

                        now thanks to Uncle Bernie you have this

                        job at the Water Park...

                                   ROBBIE

                             (shaking his head)

                         Grounds crew. What kind of job is that?

                         It sound like the guy who cleans out the

                         coffee pots.

                                  CONNIE

                        Bernie says you help keep the park clean,

                        sweep up, that sort of thing.

                        I'm sure it won't be so bad. Besides, a

                        lot of the kids who work at this park go

                        to the same high school you'll be going

                        to. You can start the school year with

                        some ready-made friends.

                                   ROBBIE

                         I had friends in Oceanside. I had

                         something to do for the summer.

               They pass the main Water World sign.    Hanging below it is a

               banner that says Opening Tomorrow!.

                                  CONNIE

                        Hanging out at the beach surfing with

                        your friends is not my idea of something

Page 4 of 81

                         to do. This way you'll make some money

                         and meet people here. You'd best get

                         used to it. This is where we live now.

                         We're staying.

                                   ROBBIE

                         All thanks to Dad and his secretary.

                                   CONNIE

                         Administrative Assistant.

                                     ROBBIE

                         Whatever.    Some summer....

               They have arrived at the front gates of Water World, Kids

               are in a line leading to a check-in canopy kiosk that has a

               sign saying Employee Check In.

                                   CONNIE

                         Promise me you'll give it a

                         try....please?

                                   ROBBIE

                             (giving in to the inevitable)

                         I will. I promise. See you later

               He shuts the car door and walks over to the end of the line.

       7       EXT. EARLY MORNING. - DAY FRONT GATES OF WATER WORLD            7

               There are about 40-50 teenagers in various default street

               clothes, shorts and tees mostly. Robbie takes his place in

               line behind an older, taller boy, ALEX, who seems to know

               almost everyone, and has made it his personal mission to

               greet them.

                                   ALEX

                             (back still to ROBBIE)

                         ...and so SHE says I'll have the filet

                         AND the lobster". I had to borrow twenty

                         bucks from Fitzgerald just to get out of

                         the restaurant.

               Two guys in front of Alex are laughing now.     Further down the

               line however, another voice pops up.

                                   DOUG

                             (waving to ALEX)

                         By the way. Where is that twenty bucks?

                                  ALEX

                            (avoiding)

                        Ohhh, hey Dougie. I'll catch up with you

                        later...

                            (turning around to ROBBIE as

                             not to continue the

                             conversation)

                        Hey, how you doin'? Haven't seen you

                        before.

Page 5 of 81

               ALEX looks in his wallet, as do we.    It is empty.

                                   ROBBIE

                             (nodding)

                         I'm Robbie. Robbie Zirpollo.

                                     ALEX

                        I'm Alex.     Where you workin'?

                                   ROBBIE

                         I believe it's with the Grounds Crew?

                                  ALEX

                        What's the matter, can't swim?

                                   ROBBIE

                             (surprised)

                         I can swim. Why?

                                   ALEX

                         Well, you look old enough to be a guard.

                                     ROBBIE

                        Almost 16.     I get my license in

                        September.

                                  ALEX

                        It's just that most of the guys on

                        grounds are a little younger than you.

                        Most guys your age that can swim are

                        guards.

                                  ROBBIE

                        Well, I just moved here. I guess I

                        missed guard tryouts. You're a guard

                        then?

                                  ALEX

                        Oh, no no no. I work concessions...at

                        Aokee's Surf and Snack Shack. It's just

                        as well. The guards are mostly stuck up

                        anyway. The rest of us are the ones who

                        know how to have fun.

                                   ROBBIE

                         Can't swim, huh?

                                  ALEX

                            (smiling)

                        Nope.

                                  ROBBIE

                            (listening to speaker on post

                             above)

                        What is that?

                                  ALEX

                            (mimicking his perception of

                             surfers)

                        Surf tunes, dude!

                            (back to his own voice)

                        You'll get used to it. You'll get to

                        where you miss it. I had to buy two CD's

                        just to get through the winter.

               They are now at the front of the line. A teenage girl

               MELISSA is sitting at the table with papers and a clipboard.

                                  ALEX (CONT'D)

                            (gesturing)

                        Ahh. And here we have the fair Melissa,

                        time clerk extraordinaire...

                                  MELISSA

                            (shaking her head no)

                        Oh, Alex. Am I going to have to put up

                        with your crap for another entire summer?

                                  ALEX

                            (looking upward toward the sky)

                        Dear Melissa.

                        There's nothing about our relationship

                        that couldn't be fixed by us spending a

                        few moments together in the pumphouse

                        behind Thunder Bay.

                                   MELISSA

                         Yeah, well from what I hear, it would be

                         a BRIEF few moments.

                                   ROBBIE

                             (wincing)

                         Ouch.

                                  ALEX

                            (not missing a beat)

                        My dear, you cut me to the quick. Check

                        off my name and that of my amigo here,

                        Mr. Robbie Zirpollo.

                                  MELISSA

                            (handing them cards)

                        Fill out these emergency cards, and turn

                        them in when you pick up your

                        uniforms....

                            (pointing)

                        over there. And Alex?

                                   ALEX

                             (to ROBBIE)

                         She wants me.

                             (turning back to MELISSA)

                         Yeeees?

                                  MELISSA

                            (finger pointing)

                        This year, let's clock in only our OWN

                        time card, shall we?

                             (head shaking, to ROBBIE,

                              walking together)

                         Some people have no sense of humor.

       8       EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - OUTSIDE UNIFORM BUILDING         8

               ROBBIE and ALEX walk up to yet another line of about 4 or 5

               teens. At the front a teenage girl and a teenage guy are

               behind a counter and handing out uniforms based on a

               clipboard list.

               As ROBBIE and ALEX reach the back of the line, TIFFANY, a

               blond beauty and two other girls brush past them to the front

               of the line.

                                   ROBBIE

                             (taken aback, breathing in

                              through his nose)

                         Whoa....who was that?

                                   ALEX

                             (unimpressed, putting his hand

                              on ROBBIE's shoulder as if to

                              hold him back, like a horse

                              that is riled up)

                         Eeeaasy there, big fella. Not in your

                         lifetime.

                             (wistfully, glancing over)

                         Or mine.

                                   ROBBIE

                         So who is she?

                                   ALEX

                         Miss Tiffany Maxwell, daughter of Big

                         Mike Maxwell, owner and operator of this

                         here fine water park.

               WE SEE TIFFANY and her two friends are quickly given their

               uniforms by the attendants, as they ignore the kids who have

               waited in line.

                                   ALEX (CONT'D)

                         See, Princess Tiffany and her friends

                         pretty much have the run of the park.

                         Her boyfriend is Dan Peterson, a guy we

                         all call Cowboy, one of the lifeguards.

                         Pretty decent guy from what I can tell.

                         But she's a piece of work. Your best

                         strategy is to steer clear of her and she

                         won't cause you any trouble.

                                   ROBBIE

                         Cowboy, huh. Big guy?

                                     ALEX

                         Big. Guy.

                                   ROBBIE

                             (takes in a deep breath)

                         Hmm.

               They are now at the front of the line.

                                   MALE UNIFORM GUY

                         Hey Alex.

                             (calling back to FEMALE UNIFORM

                              PERSON)

                         Aokee's. Large.

                             (to ROBBIE)

                                   MALE UNIFORM GUY (CONT'D)

                         Name?

               Female Uniform Person has brought a blue Hawaiian shirt on a

               hanger.

                                   ROBBIE

                         Rob Zirpollo. Uh, Robert Zirpollo

                                   MALE UNIFORM GUY

                             (looks on clipboard)

                         Grounds?

                             (looks at FEMALE UNIFORM

                              PERSON)

                                   MALE UNIFORM GUY (CONT'D)

                             (and FEMALE UNIFORM PERSON,

                              together, ominously)

                         Grounds.

               She disappears to the back.

                                   ROBBIE

                             (to ALEX)

                         So what is this grounds thing, anyway?

                                   ALEX

                         Let's just say....you are critical and

                         indispensable to the ongoing operation...

                         and....flow of things here at the park.

                             (he and MALE UNIFORM GUY

                              exchange a knowing glance)

                                  FEMALE UNIFORM PERSON

                        Here you go, tiger. One grounds.

                        Medium. You have a pair of green shorts

                        at home?

               ROBBIE shakes his head "no".

                                   FEMALE UNIFORM PERSON (CONT'D)

                         Buy some. Tonight. Wear them tomorrow

                         along with this shirt. You need to

                         report to the area just south of Surf's

                         Up. Look for a guy wearing Army pants

                         and glasses.

                                   ALEX

                         I'll show him. I'm going in that

                         direction.

                             (to ROBBIE with feigned

                              excitement)

                         You get to meet The Colonel!

               They walk off.   As they walk off we can hear ALEX in the

               distance...

                                   ALEX (CONT'D)

                             (marching)

                         Left. Left. Left right left.

       9       EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK SHACK       9

               Aokee's is a restaurant near Thunder Bay. It seats about 50

               and is lavishly decorated in a Hawaiian Surf and Ocean motif,

               with surf memorabilia, fish nets, surfboards, and the like.

               AOKEE is a large 375 pound plus apparently Hawaiian man, late

               twenties, early thirties, wearing a purple Hawaiian shirt,

               blue shorts and a white chef's apron that says KISS THE COOK.

               WE SEE him on a pay phone behind the counter.

                                  AOKEE

                            (to person on the line)

                        David...how you do this to me? I have

                        full staff with you. I save your spot.

                        I was counting on you.

                            (listens, nods)

                        Yes, yes....but The Gap? What you think

                        you do there? Are there girls in

                        swimming suits? Have you forgotten?

                            (listens, shaking head)

                        Tips. Do you get tips? Cash money?

                            (listens some more)

               ALEX walks up.   AOKEE waves to him.   He is obviously upset.

                                   AOKEE (CONT'D)

                             (resigned)

                         Well, come see us this summer, eh?

                         You're a good kid...a good worker.     Yeah,

                         you too.

               AOKEE hangs up the phone.

                                    ALEX

                         Who....?

                                  AOKEE

                         David. Seems to think there is future in

                         retail. Now what I do? I'm one person

                         short. Park opens tomorrow.

               AOKEE buries his head in his hands on the counter.

                                   ALEX

                             (thinking)

                         You know...I just met a guy that's old

 Page 10 of 81

                         enough to work here, but he's stuck in

                         grounds.

                                   AOKEE

                             (perking up)

                         Good guy?

                                   ALEX

                         Seemed like our kind of people.

               AOKEE thinks for a moment. He glances up towards Surf's Up.

               It hits both he and ALEX at the same time...

                                  AOKEE

                        We need to get him before he get his

                        plunger!

               They take off running.

     10        EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - TRAIL FROM AOKEE'S TO SURF'S10

               UP

               AOKEE and ALEX are running together. They get about 50 feet

               before AOKEE, large man that he is, runs out of breath.

               ALEX, like a boxer in training, sort of runs in place,

               keeping loose, ready for AOKEE to catch his wind. Off they

               go again, get another 50 feet, and the same thing happens.

                                    AOKEE

                             (out of breath)

                         Alex......

                             (wheeze)

                         ..you got to go ahead...

                             (wheeze)

                         ...stall 'til I get there.

                                     ALEX

                               (nodding, running in place)

                         OK.

               ALEX takes off, and AOKEE runs again....

     11        EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - SURF'S UP WAVE POOL SOUTH          11

               WE SEE several rolling trash cans lined up in a row, along

               with several janitorial carts filled with cleaning utensils

               and supplies.

               THE COLONEL is standing, dressed in army fatigue pants and a

               Water World golf shirt, with a green Water World baseball

               cap. He is wearing black horn-rim glasses, thick lenses, and

               carrying a clipboard.

               Lined up as if an army unit are ten grounds kids, including

               ROBBIE, who is sixth furthest from THE COLONEL. They are all

               younger than ROBBIE except one, EDDIE, whom we met at the

               beginning of the film.

               EDDIE is standing tall and straight, proud to be there.      He

               is nearest THE COLONEL

    Page 11 of 81

                                   THE COLONEL

                             (looking up from clipboard)

                         Well, it looks like we have a good staff

                         here. Yes...yes a good staff. It will be

                         an excellent summer. Remember as we go

                         through training today, our park is

                         judged by the work WE do. If we do it

                         well, the people come back.

                             (walking up and down the line)

                         We have a little tradition here on the

                         grounds crew. Rather than having to

                         learn a lot of names, many of which I can

                         never hope to pronounce properly, each

                         grounds crew member gets a grounds crew

                         nickname. You will be known by that

                         nickname in every way except, of course,

                         your paycheck and employee records.

               THE COLONEL looks over his paperwork.

                                   THE COLONEL    (CONT'D)

                         Let's see, what do we    have? Hmm...yes.

                         OK, first up is Eddie    Cochran. Your

                         grounds crew nickname    will be.....Eddie!

               EDDIE smiles knowingly. This has been his grounds crew

               nickname for the last 8 years, mostly because he would never

               answer to anything else, and THE COLONEL gave up trying.

                                   THE COLONEL (CONT'D)

                         Now crewmembers, listen up. Eddie here

                         has eight years experience on the grounds

                         crew. Why, I'd like to think there isn't

                         anything, any situation that Eddie hasn't

                         faced. Listen to him. Learn from him.

                         Watch what he does. This man is the

                         finest, most conscientious grounds

                         crewman we've ever had.

               EDDIE is beaming with pride now. THE COLONEL pulls a brand

               new toilet plunger from the cart nearby and hands it to

               EDDIE. EDDIE shoulders it as if it were a rifle.

               THE COLONEL walks down the line.

                                   THE COLONEL (CONT'D)

                         Let's see...Clark? Hmmm. Your grounds

                         crew nickname will be....Sparky.

               It is all ROBBIE can do not to laugh. THE COLONEL goes on to

               the next kid, SKEETER who is tall, skinny and goofy-looking.

               SKEETER'S eyes are faced forward, but something catches them.

               His eyes follow an unseen object as we begin to hear a small

               mosquito. Finally his eyes follow it until he looks, cross

               eyed at his own nose.

               THE COLONEL has taken note of this and is following it too.

               SKEETER can take no more, and brushes it off his nose as he

               makes a face.

    Page 12 of 81

                                   SKEETER

                         Sorry, sir. Mosquito.

                                   THE COLONEL

                         Hmmm.....your grounds crew nickname will

                         be.....Skeeter.

               THE COLONEL steps over the cart and gets another new plunger

               and hands it to SKEETER who follows EDDIE's lead.

               Next in line is a short, chubby lad, SNITCH. As THE COLONEL

               approaches him, a quick sound of passing gas is heard.

               THE COLONEL is startled, and SNITCH makes a quick finger

               motion indicating the culprit is SKEETER, next to him.

                                   THE COLONEL (CONT'D)

                             (looking at the clipboard)

                         Bradley, is it? OK, Mr. Bradley.....your

                         grounds crew nickname will be Snitch.

               SNITCH shows his dismay with a frown. THE COLONEL has run

               out of new plungers already and is forced to move to one of

               last year's leftovers, which look somewhat depressing.

               He gets one and give it to SNITCH, who looks at it, makes a

               face, and decides not to shoulder it. ROBBIE is so depressed

               he looks like he's about to pass out.

               His worst fears have been realized.    His summer is passing

               before his eyes.

               There's only one more person, a young 14 year-old girl, to go

               before ROBBIE. THE COLONEL addresses her.

                                   THE COLONEL (CONT'D)

                         Melinda Tally. Hmmm... your grounds crew

                         nickname will be...

                             (thinking)

               Suddenly ALEX bursts onto the scene, and even he, at this

               point, is somewhat out of breath.

                                   ALEX

                         Hello, Colonel!

                                   THE COLONEL

                             (thinking, staring)

                         Alex, isn't it?

                                   ALEX

                         Yes sir, Colonel. And what a fine staff

                         you've assembled this year. Have you

                         told them yet about your army background?

                                   THE COLONEL

                         Well, no, I didn't think it was..

                                   ALEX

                            (interrupting, to the grounds

                             kids)

                        The Colonel here is very modest. Did you

                        know that he reorganized the entire

                        process of cleaning and sanitizing an

                        army barracks and its latrines?

                                   THE COLONEL

                         Well, it really wasn't much of a...

                                   ALEX

                             (interrupting again)

                         Wasn't much?

                             (again, to grounds kids)

                         Can you just imagine for a moment the

                         germs and bacteria our American soldiers

                         could pick up in an unsanitised army

                         latrine? It's impossible to determine

                         just how many lives have been saved

                         thanks to the efforts of this one humble

                         Army Colonel.

                                   THE COLONEL

                         Well, I suppose when you put it that

                         way...

                                   ALEX

                             (to the grounds kids)

                         I, too, came up through the ranks when at

                         age 14, I began my service here at Water

                         World learning from this great man.

                                  THE COLONEL

                        Yes....I remember now.....what was your

                        grounds nickname...?

                                  ALEX

                        Not even sure I remember it myself, sir.

                        But I remember much more. Did you tell

                        them about the film?

                                   THE COLONEL

                         Film?

                                  ALEX

                            (to THE COLONEL)

                        "Hygiene Makes You Happy"

                            (to the grounds kids)

                        Every enlisted man in the army has seen

                        it. Some by choice. All from the mind

                        of The Colonel here...

                                   THE COLONEL

                             (to himself)

                         I never forget a grounds nickname....

               AOKEE has finally made it now, but is, of course, out of

               breath again.

                                   THE COLONEL (CONT'D)

                            (concerned)

                        Aokee, good God, man...are you OK?

               AOKEE gestures he is fine, and does a combination of charades

               and Hawaiian pantomime before he finally speaks.

                                   AOKEE

                         Colonel....terrible mistake...

               ALEX gets behind AOKEE, deciding he needs some help, feeding

               him words.

                                   ALEX

                             (quietly behind AOKEE)

                         Lost paperwork....

                                   AOKEE

                         Lost paperwork....

                                   ALEX

                         An error in the front office...

                                   AOKEE

                         Error in front office....

                                   ALEX

                         Spiced applesauce....

                                     AOKEE

                         Spiced...

               AOKEE stops, turn and glares at ALEX, who merely smiles and

               shrugs.

                                   THE COLONEL

                         Good God, man, what are you trying to

                         say?

               ALEX comes around from behind AOKEE.

                                  ALEX

                        It's Robbie sir. He was supposed to work

                        at Aokee's and through some crazy mix-up,

                        he ended up here.

                                   THE COLONEL

                             (looking at clipboard)

                         Zirpollo? Well this is highly

                         irregular...

               He is flipping though the papers, confused.

                                   ALEX

                         Most annoying....

                                   THE COLONEL

                         Most annoying....

                                   ALEX

                         Never happened before....

                                   THE COLONEL

                         Never happened before....

                                   ALEX

                         Spaghetti marinara...

                                  THE COLONEL

                        Spa....what?

                            (exasperated)

                        Well, if he was supposed to be assigned

                        to you, we'll just have to let him go...

               ROBBIE has caught on and is quick to step out of line, and

               pick up his shirt to be ready to go.

                                  ROBBIE

                            (to THE COLONEL)

                        I was confused myself, sir. I had heard

                        I was working for some Hawaiian guy.

                                  AOKEE

                            (reassuring)

                        I promise, we go straight to personnel,

                        straighten the whole thing out. You

                        won't need to worry.

                                      THE COLONEL

                         Very well.     We'll just have to make-do.

               THE COLONEL goes back to the girl MELINDA he was about to

               nickname before the interruption, but is staring after ALEX,

               AOKEE and ROBBIE as they walk off. He looks at MELINDA. He

               looks back at ALEX & company. It hits him.

                                   THE COLONEL (CONT'D)

                             (remembering)

                         Snafu.

                                      MELINDA

                         Sir?

                                   THE COLONEL

                         His grounds crew nickname.     I remember it

                         now. Snafu.

     12        EXT -DAY - HILL AREA ABOVE THUNDER BAY                         12

               The entire staff of Water World is assembled for a pre

               opening pep talk from owner BIG MIKE MAXWELL. He wears a

               Water World Golf shirt, shorts and a crew-style marine hat.

               Standing next to him is RICHARD THOMPSON, head lifeguard.

               The workers are sitting on the hill.

    Page 16 of 81

               AOKEE, THE COLONEL and other "management" types are standing

               off to the side. TIFFANY and her friends are sitting up

               front.

               ALEX and ROBBIE are sitting together towards the back, and

               ROBBIE's grounds t-shirt is no longer in his hand, but has

               been replaced by a folded AOKEE'S blue Hawaiian shirt.

               There is a lot of noise from everyone talking.

                                   BIG MIKE

                             (motioning to get everyone to

                              settle down)

                         Okay, everybody, let's quiet down for a

                         minute.

                             (they do, and he looks down at

                              his clipboard)

                         For those who don't know me, my name is

                         Michael Maxwell, and I...sort of run

                         things around here.

               A chant starts up, with affection...

                                   EVERYONE TOGETHER

                         Big Mike! Big Mike! Big Mike!

               BIG MIKE smiles, this has happened before, probably a

               tradition.

                                   BIG MIKE

                            (again motioning to settle

                             down)

                        Okay, yeah thanks. Now, I want go over a

                        few basic things. First of all, make

                        sure you've all filled out your paperwork

                        with personnel, cause nobody gets paid

                        unless they do. Come to think of it, I

                        suppose it's better for me that you don't

                        fill out your paperwork, then I don't

                        have to pay you. I'll make it optional.

                        If you want to get paid, fill out your

                        paperwork.

                            (looking at clipboard)

                        Let's remember, the people who come here

                        are our guests, and your job is to see

                        they have a safe and fun experience here.

                        Let's work together to keep the park

                        clean and safe, and we'll have a great

                        summer together. Now with a few words is

                        our head lifeguard, Richard Thompson.

               Another cheer starts up, smaller this time, which ALEX

               starts.

                                   SMALLER GROUP

                         Big Dick! Big Dick Big Dick!

                                  RICHARD

                            (wincing some, but not

    Page 17 of 81

                              surprised, motioning to settle

                              down)

                         Yeah, yeah, very funny, we're all very

                         amused. Okay, many of you have been in

                         training for some time, and some of you

                         still have a ways to go...

               WE SEE a quick shot of some geeky younger guards wearing

               water wings, sharky goggles and noseplugs and looking less

               than confident...

                                   RICHARD (CONT'D)

                             (glancing at the water wing

                              group wistfully, almost to

                              himself)

                         ...a long ways to go...

               He looks down at his clipboard.

                                  RICHARD (CONT'D)

                        ...but I'd like to take a moment to

                        speak, mostly to the guards, but

                        certainly everyone has a role in this.

                        We can take everything we've learned and

                        distill it down to two simple rules.

                        Rule number one:

               He pauses, thoughtful for a moment, but building into a near

               rage for effect to impress on everyone...

                                   RICHARD (CONT'D)

                             (loudly, emphatically, angry at

                              the thought that anybody

                              might...)

                         Don't drown!

               He stops, composing himself.

                                   RICHARD (CONT'D)

                             (almost quietly)

                         Rule number two:

               Again, thoughtful but building to a rage at the thought that

               this could happen...

                                   RICHARD (CONT'D)

                             (loudly, emphatically)

                         Don't let anyone else drown!

               He stops again, and regains his composure.

                                   RICHARD (CONT'D)

                             (almost quietly to the stunned

                              crowd)

                         Thank you. Have a great summer!

               There is stunned silence for a moment.    They're not sure how

               to react.

                                   ALEX

    Page 18 of 81

                             (breaking the silence)

                         Alright! Whoo whoo!

               ALEX, then everyone begins applauding. ROBBIE looks at ALEX

               quizzically, ALEX just shrugs. The meeting breaks up.

     13        INT - MORNING - THE NEXT DAY - AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK SHACK      13

               Everyone is hurrying around, getting ready for opening day.

               ROBBIE, wearing his new blue Hawaiian shirt, is cutting

               pineapple. AOKEE is busy hovering over everyone, and cooking

               chicken on the grill. ALEX walks in.

                                   ALEX

                             (to ROBBIE)

                         Hey, hey lookin' good. Blue is your

                         color. Beats that stupid t-shirt, huh?

                                    AOKEE

                              (unhappy, stressed)

                         Alex! You are late. Come on, is opening

                         day!

               ROBBIE finishes the pineapple and hands the tray to AOKEE,

               almost spilling it.

                                   AOKEE (CONT'D)

                             (to ROBBIE and ALEX)

                         You two start setting tables.

               ALEX takes a pile of silverware wrapped in napkins, and

               points to ROBBIE to grab a box of sugar packets to refill the

               dispensers. ROBBIE grabs it quickly, enthusiastically, but

               loses his grip and spills the packets on the floor.

               At that moment, AUDREY a girl in her teens who works at

               AOKEE'S and is stacking plastic cups on the counter,

               accidentally knocks a stack of cups to the ground.

               RAMON, a teenage boy who works there is behind the counter.

               He bends over, disappearing, and we hear a crash of pots and

               pans. His head peers up from below the counter sheepishly.

               AOKEE turns from the grill looking at all this, and has a

               worried look, but smiles and shrugs weakly.

                                   AOKEE (CONT'D)

                             (to ALEX, gesturing)

                         Alex. Come here a minute.

               ALEX comes up close next to him at the grill so they can

               talk.

                                   AOKEE (CONT'D)

                             (with intensity)

                         Alex, look. We falling apart. I made

                         you assistant manager this year. Go

                         assistant manage.

                                   ALEX

    Page 19 of 81

                             (agreeing)

                         No problem.

               ALEX pops a CD out of the rack above the sound system, and

               puts it in the CD player, stopping the standard pastoral

               Hawaiian music that has been playing.

               He turns up the volume some on the amp, and goes over to

               SARAH, a teenage girl working there, and grabs her grass

               skirt by the Velcro, removing it with a Velcro rip.

                                   ALEX (CONT'D)

                         Sorry, Sarah, but I need to borrow this.

                                   SARAH

                             (surprised)

                         Hey! How did you know I wear shorts

                         under that?

                                    ALEX

                             (mock surprise, rolling his

                              eyes)

                         Oh, Puh-leeaase.

               ALEX walks back out to the dining area, everyone is still

               working.

                                   ALEX (CONT'D)

                             (to all)

                         Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your

                         attention, please?

               Everyone stops and looks at ALEX.

                                   ALEX (CONT'D)

                         In exactly 30 minutes, hundreds of

                         dripping wet customers with fistfuls of

                         money smelling of chlorine and suntan

                         lotion will be walking in here.

                         And what will they be looking for?

                             (as if directing a choir)

                                   EVERYONE TOGETHER

                             (except ROBBIE, who doesn't

                              know any better)

                         The best teriyaki east of the pacific!!!

                                     ALEX

                         Annnnnnd?

                                   EVERYONE TOGETHER

                             (Again except ROBBIE, who

                              doesn't know any better)

                         The finest smoothies in the state!!!

                                   ALEX

                         Now, everyone's a little tense, except

                         me, of course. So to help you get in the

                         proper frame of mind and relax, we need

    Page 20 of 81

                         the right soundtrack.

                             (to AOKEE)

                         Maestro?

               AOKEE hits the play button on the CD player.

                                   ALEX (CONT'D)

                         This is little tune I like to call the

                         Paradise Slide.

                             (mouthing with the song as it

                              starts)

                         One, two, a one two three.

               The music starts and ALEX, now wearing SARAH's grass skirt,

               launches into his version of the electric slide, Hawaiian

               style.

               EVERYONE ELSE gets the beat and begins working to the music.

               AOKEE is using his spatulas as drum sticks on the overhanging

               kitchen tools.

               RAMON has inverted an empty pot and is beating it conga-drum

               style.

               ROBBIE has picked up the sugar packets and ALEX is dancing

               and quickly (almost casually) tossing silverware/napkin rolls

               to ROBBIE as ROBBIE catches them (at first with some

               difficulty) and puts them on the tables.

               SARAH has re-stacked the cups, and is juggling salt & pepper

               shakers, placing them on the tables. AUDREY chops onions to

               the beat.

                                   EVERYONE TOGETHER

                             (on the chorus)

                         Don Ho, Don Ho, Don Ho. Don Ho, Don Ho,

                         Don Ho.

               AOKEE has now taken all the chicken off the grill and comes

               out from behind the counter, dancing. The others form a

               CONGA LINE behind him.

                                   EVERYONE TOGETHER (CONT'D)

                             (on the chorus)

                         Don Ho, Don Ho, Don Ho. Don Ho, Don Ho,

                         Don Ho.

               As they go by the tables they put on any missing items. They

               get into it more and more, AOKEE especially, swinging his

               huge, 375 pound guy hips.

                                   EVERYONE TOGETHER (CONT'D)

                             (on the chorus)

                         Don Ho, Don Ho, Don Ho. Don Ho, Don Ho,

                         Don Ho.

               As the song ends (abruptly), AOKEE bumps a surfboard (part of

               the restaurant's decoration) with his hip, knocking it and

               another one to the ground.

       Page 21 of 81

               There is a loud crash and everyone pauses and looks at AOKEE,

               waiting to see if he gets mad.

               AOKEE looks down at his hip, and makes a puppy-dog face like

               "I didn't know my hips were that big...." Everyone claps,

               laughing. AOKEE takes a bow.

     14        INT -LATER THAT DAY - AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK SHACK               14

               ROBBIE and ALEX are carrying bus tubs loaded with dirty

               dishes back toward the kitchen from the dining area.

               AOKEE is sipping on a smoothie and leaning back on a counter.

               There are only a few customers in the eating area.

               They set the tubs down on a counter that passes to the back

               area. An unseen person takes them into the dishwashing area.

                                   AOKEE

                             (to ALEX and ROBBIE)

                         You did good work today.

                         Here. I made you some of my special

                         Power Smoothies. More customers later

                         wanting dinner before park closes. I

                         can't have you falling asleep on me.

                                   AOKEE (CONT'D)

                             (to ALEX)

                         Alex, we are completely out of table

                         stretchers and left-handed coffee pots.

                         Take Robbie and go find some. I think

                         some at the first-aid station near Surf's

                         Up pool.

                                   ALEX

                             (nodding knowingly)

                         Right. See you in a little while.

               They walk off carrying their smoothies.

     15        EXT - MOMENTS LATER - THUNDER BAY CONCESSIONS AREA             15

               ROBBIE and ALEX are walking past Thunder Bay concessions area

               toward THE WAVE carrying and drinking their smoothies.

                                   ROBBIE

                         So that was a typical lunch crowd?

                                   ALEX

                         Well, it's early in the season yet.

                         We'll get busier.

                                   ROBBIE

                             (incredulous)

                         Busier?

                                   ALEX

                             (laughing)

                         Don't worry. You'll get used to it.      And

                         tips were good, right?

       Page 22 of 81

                                   ROBBIE

                         There's nothing like cash money in your

                         pocket. What's that over there?

               They are coming up on THE WAVE area.

                                   ALEX

                         Oh, you'll find this ride interesting.

     16        EXT - MOMENTS LATER - DAY - THE WAVE AREA                      16

               The walk up to THE WAVE attraction, where kids are surfing in

               a high-water pressure river/ sheet of water. Surf music

               plays loudly here, and kids are doing all kinds of tricks.

               Some riders are good, some are not, and fall quickly.

               We also see SKEETER and SNITCH, the tall skinny and short

               chubby grounds kids we met earlier. They are cleaning up

               around the exit area of THE WAVE.

                                   ALEX

                             (as a rider falls)

                         It's a lot harder than it looks.

                                   ROBBIE

                         I can't imagine it's that difficult.

                             (to himself)

                         ...no rudder on the board...

                                   ALEX

                         Now this is a place of many wonders.     See

                         those guys in line over there?

               WE SEE some guys that look a little stoned with unusual hair

               laughing and talking to each other.

                                   ALEX (CONT'D)

                         We call them "Wave Bums". They all have

                         season passes, and do little more than

                         ride the wave all day long. Some of them

                         get pretty good.

               Alex points up to a fence, behind which some smoke appears to

               be drifting up.

                                   ALEX (CONT'D)

                         That's where they hang out when they're

                         not riding the wave. Don't get too close

                         to them.

                                   ROBBIE

                         No?

                                   ALEX

                             (sniffing)

                         Contact high.

               ROBBIE nods, understanding. ALEX points back to THE WAVE.

    Page 23 of 81

                                   ALEX (CONT'D)

                         And there, my friend, is another one of

                         The Wave's features.

               WE SEE a pretty girl in line to ride.

                                   ALEX (CONT'D)

                         We call them "Wave Babes". And there's a

                         special secret to this ride.

               With that ALEX walks over to BOB, a guy in his late teens,

               wearing a Security Golf Shirt. He is standing and looking

               off in a different direction.

                                   ALEX (CONT'D)

                         Hey, Bob....can I borrow your radio a

                         minute?

                                   BOB

                         Sure.

               He hands him the radio, and ALEX is back with ROBBIE.

                                   ALEX

                             (into radio)

                         Hey Frank, it's Alex.

               ALEX waves and FRANK, the guard watching THE WAVE waves back.

                                   FRANK VO

                             (heard through the radio)

                         Yo, Alex.

                                   ALEX

                             (into radio)

                         Listen you have a possible code 4.

                             (to ROBBIE)

                         Means a "hottie".

                                  ALEX (CONT'D)

                            (to radio)

                        She's up next. A free chicken sandwich

                        and a smoothie if you bounce up the

                        pressure a bit.

                                   FRANK VO

                             (heard through radio)

                         You got it bud. But two smoothies.

                         "Volcanos".

                                  ALEX

                            (to ROBBIE)

                        He knows my weak spot.

                            (to radio)

                        Two Volcanos and a chicken sandwich.

                                   FRANK VO

                             (heard through radio)

                         Time to go to ludicrous speed!

     Page 24 of 81

               WE SEE FRANK push forward on a handle next to him that seems

               to resemble the throttle on a speedboat. The ambient noise

               from the wave is noticeably higher.

               The WAVE BABE jumps into the water with the board.      SKEETER

               and SNITCH are still cleaning near the exit.

                                   ALEX

                             (to ROBBIE, still holding the

                              radio)

                         Watch, and wait....

               THEY LOOK intently at the WAVE BABE, who is pretty good, even

               with the increased water flow. But, after a few deft moves,

               she falls. ALEX looks, and sees what he is looking for.

               ROBBIE smiles.

                                    ALEX (CONT'D)

                         Yesss!

               We look back at the WAVE BABE, but the water is obscuring our

               view. We then see a medium shot of SKEETER and SNITCH. The

               WAVE BABE walks past them carrying a board, but we don't see

               below her waist, the board obscures our view.

               SNITCH sees, and freezes, dumbstruck. SKEETER is looking

               down at the grate where THE WAVE water drains. He reaches

               down and pulls something out, and turns to the WAVE BABE

               walking away.

                                   SKEETER

                             (unaffected)

                         Excuse me... Miss?

                             (louder)

                         Hello...excuse me...?

               Finally she turns. We see her, but just a flash of her from

               the back, as the board covers her waist area. She is puzzled

               by this grounds kid.

                                   SKEETER (CONT'D)

                             (holding up the bottom to her

                              swimsuit)

                         Is this yours?

               She looks down behind the board and reacts.     She bites her

               lower lip, winces and nods yes.

               SKEETER hands her her swimsuit, and she looks around and

               backs away towards a towel hanging from the fence nearby.

               SNITCH is still frozen, stunned by what he's just seen, mouth

               wide open. SKEETER waves his hand in front of SNITCH's face.

               No reaction.   He's never seen a naked girl before.

               We're back to ALEX and ROBBIE.

                                   ROBBIE

                             (looking at ALEX)

                         You were right. I was interested in

       Page 25 of 81

                         this.

                                   ALEX

                         Well, sometime bring your swimsuit.

                         We'll come back on break. I'll show you

                         how to do it. Surf's is this way. And

                         keep an eye out for Frank over there. We

                         owe him.

               ROBBIE nods in agreement, and they walk off.

     17        EXT MOMENTS LATER - DAY - NEAR SURF'S UP POOL                  17

               ROBBIE and ALEX are walking past the SURF'S UP wave pool.

                                   ALEX

                             (pointing)

                         The First Aid station is over there. Just

                         ask the guard. I just want to say hello

                         to this girl I know.

                                   ROBBIE

                         OK.

               ROBBIE walks over to the First Aid Station. DOUG FITZGERALD,

               the guy we heard in line on the first day is there, he's a

               guard.

                                   ROBBIE (CONT'D)

                         Hey. I've been sent to find some table

                         stretchers and left-handed coffee pots.

                                   DOUG

                         Oh, you must be the new guy at Aokee's.

                                   ROBBIE

                         Yeah, how'd you know?

                                   DOUG

                         Lucky guess. Saw some at the top of

                         River Country. Just ask one of the

                         guards over there.

                                   ROBBIE

                         Thanks.

                                   DOUG

                         And hey...tell that wienie Alex he still

                         owes me twenty bucks!

                                   ROBBIE

                             (looking back and waving as he

                              walks away)

                         Got it.

     18        EXT - MOMENTS LATER - CUSTOMER SERVICE KIOSK                   18

               ALEX and ROBBIE are walking to RIVER COUNTRY and walk past

               JAFFA in the CUSTOMER SERVICE KIOSK.

                         Alex!

               They turn and walk over.

                                   ALEX

                             (to ROBBIE)

                         Jaffa plays the tunes and talks the talk.

               The PHONE RINGS, and Jaffa turns to answer.

                                   JAFFA

                             (into phone)

                         What? No way.

                             (hangs up phone, to ALEX &

                              ROBBIE)

               JAFFA smiles and picks up a radio.

                         Attention Lost River guards. We have a

                         report that some huge fat bald guy has

                         abandoned his swimsuit and is slidin'

                         down Lost River with nothin' on but a

                         smile. Be watchin' for a great white

     19        EXT - DAY - TOP OF LOST RIVER RIDE                             19

               WE SEE two female life guards, both with a surprised look on

               their faces. One has just reached into the water and picks it

               up to display a HUGE pair of swim trunks. Both girls make an

               Eeeew face.

                        He's calling for security.

               ALEX wanders off a moment, looking at something going on in

               the distance.

                                   ROBBIE

                             (to JAFFA)

                         Wow. Jamaica. I thought I was far from

                         home.

                                  JAFFA

                            (dropping the accent a bit)

                        I'll let you in on a little secret.

                        Perception is everything...now, Jamal

                        from Aurora, he's probably over with

                        those guys...

               WE SEE SKEETER and SNITCH walking into the men's room,

               looking suspiciously around.

                                   JAFFA (CONT'D)

                             (back to the accent)

                         ...cleaning the rest rooms. But Jaffa

                         from Jamaica, he's in customer service,

                         wearin' the nice shirt and playing the

                         music. Perception and atmosphere. You

                         get it?

               ROBBIE smiles and nods, and waves goodbye to catch up with

               ALEX.

     21        INT - MOMENTS LATER - IN MEN'S CHANGING/REST ROOM              21

               SNITCH is filling up a water balloon, while SKEETER is tying

               a piece of fishing line to the hook on the inside of the

               stall door. SKEETER climbs up on top of the stall.

               SNITCH is tying off the water balloon and grabs the other end

               of the fishing line, and ties it to the fill end of the

               balloon. He shuts the stall door, tosses the balloon up to

               SKEETER, who places it strategically on the beam above the

               toilet. SKEETER then jumps down, and they head for the door.

               Eddie Enters. We see EDDIE cautiously checking out the

               restroom. He reaches up over the closed stall door and feels

               gingerly the fishing line. He smiles and shakes his head,

               and heads for the door.

     22        EXT -MOMENTS LATER - APPROACHING MEN'S CHANGING/REST ROOM      22

               EDDIE is now pushing his cart and making his way toward the

               MEN's RESTROOM. He stops to talk to two concessions girls

               and show them a magic trick that apparently involves a deck

               of cards, which he pulls from a place on his cart. We see

               him holding the cards so one girl can pick one.

     23        EXT - MOMENTS LATER - IN FRONT OF MEN'S CHANGING/REST ROOM 23

               SKEETER pops his head out and looks around. He sees Eddie in

               the distance about 5 minutes away, and putting a plastic

               liner in a trash can. He nods and disappears into the men's

               room.

               SKEETER and SNITCH appear at the door, look out, and see

               EDDIE finishing his card trick. He presents a card for the

    Page 28 of 81

               girls to see, and the both nod encouragingly, but as they

               walk off, they look at each other and shrug.

               SKEETER and SNITCH take off, barely containing their

               laughter. But EDDIE notices them leaving. All of this has

               happened under the watchful though distant eye of ALEX.

               EDDIE goes into the restroom.

               EDDIE exits the restroom and goes to his cart.     At this point

               ALEX and ROBBIE walk up to him.

                                      ALEX

                         Hey Eddie.     What have you got?

                                   EDDIE

                         Water balloon.

               EDDIE reached onto his cart and pulls out a pair of scissors,

               eyeing them.

                                   ALEX

                         You got this?

                                    EDDIE

                         Yeah.   Rookies!

               ALEX and ROBBIE walk away as EDDIE places a "RESTROOM CLOSED"

               sandwich board in front of the door. Just then BIG MIKE

               rushes up.

                                  BIG MIKE

                            (big hurry-potty emergency)

                        Oh Eddie. Listen, I know you're working

                        but you hold on for just a minute. I've

                        been so busy, and I really gotta go.

               EDDIE motions and tries to find the words....

                                   EDDIE

                         But....no....

               But BIG MIKE is already in. Eddies waits for it, wincing,

               and there is a loud splash...

                                   BIG MIKE (O.S.)

                             (echoing through the door)

                         Yeahhhah that's cold!

               EDDIE just shrugs and puts away his scissors.

     24        EXT -MOMENTS LATER - TOP OF RIVER COUNTRY                      24

               Two young women guards, KATIE and AMY are loading kids into

               tubes and pushing them onto the slide. AMY is a little older

               than KATIE.

                                  AMY

                        ...so then he just disappeared.      I had to

                        call my Dad to come pick me up.

    Page 29 of 81

               KATIE just shakes her head in amazement. ROBBIE and ALEX

               walk up to them. AMY is out of earshot, loading a kid.

               ALEX hangs back a bit.

                                  ROBBIE

                            (to KATIE)

                        Hi. We're looking for some table

                        stretchers and left-handed coffee pots.

                                   KATIE

                         What? Amy, this guy is looking for a

                         table stretcher?

                                   AMY

                             (coming over)

                         Aokee's huh?

                                    ROBBIE

                             (surprised)

                         Uh, yes...

                                   AMY

                             (to ROBBIE, seeing ALEX in the

                              background)

                        They're all down at Big Mike's last I

                        saw.

                             (to ALEX)

                        When you gonna tell him?

                                    ALEX

                         Hi, Amy.   Who's this?

                                   AMY

                         Katie, this is Alex and...

                                  ROBBIE

                            (taken with KATIE)

                        Robbie. Ummm, Rob Zirpollo.

                                   AMY

                         Well, anyway, Big Mike's is where they

                         are.

                                    ROBBIE

                         Thanks.

               ALEX and ROBBIE walk off.

                                  AMY

                        What a couple of losers.

                                   KATIE

                        I don't know...I thought Robbie was kind

                        of cute...

                                  AMY

                        Listen, you're new, so let me tell you

                        how things are. First those guys were

                        wearing blue shorts. That means

    Page 30 of 81

                          concessions.

                              (uses her fingers to explain)

                          The Water World social structure is

                          organized on three levels. At the bottom

                          are the Trash Rats.

                                    KATIE

                          Trash rats?

                                    AMY

                          Bottom feeders. Grounds kids. Babies.

                          They clean the toilets and empty the

                          trash. Most are only 14 years old. It's

                          the only job younger kids can do here.

                          Next up is concessions. They're our

                          "middle class". We don't hang with them

                          and they don't much hang with us. At the

                          top of heap are the guards. You are a

                          guard. Girl, if you want to go out with

                          someone, stick with your own kind.

                                    KATIE

                              (looking off at ROBBIE and ALEX

                               walking away)

                          Aw, that's just silly. I think he's

                          cute.

     25        EXT -DAY   BOTTOM OF RIVER COUNTRY ON THE WAY TO BIG MIKE'S 25

               This in an area where riders splash down from riding a tube

               down the River Country slides. ROBBIE and ALEX are walking

               past the splashdown area.

                                    ROBBIE

                          What did that girl Amy mean?

                                    ALEX

                          About what?

                                    ROBBIE

                          When she said, when are you going to tell

                          him?

                                    ALEX

                          I'll tell you over a hamburger at Big

                          Mike's.

               ROBBIE and ALEX proceed to BIG MIKE's out of frame.

               SUDDENLY in the background we see a tube splashdown from a

               slide and the 7 year-old girl riding in it falls out.

               Realizing she is no longer safely in a tube she screams and

               begins splashing as if drowning. A guard nearby blows a

               single tweet of her whistle.

               IN SLOW MOTION we see four other guards throughout the area

               turn and react to the whistle. They begin running, BAYWATCH

               style towards the scene.

       Page 31 of 81

               Two guards are running and carrying a backboard. They

               converge in another BAYWATCH style slow-mo shot and line up

               along the edge of the splashdown pool.

               One guard in the middle has a rescue tube, and, still in slow

               motion, squats down slowly as if to jump in and rescue the

               girl.

               At the low end of the jump crouch, however he stops.      WE SEE

               his face in close-up as he says.

                                   RESCUE GUARD

                             (slow-motion, voice distorted,

                              to the girl)

                         Staaaannnd Uuuuuuuupppp!

               The drowning girl stops splashing wildly, and realizes she

               can indeed stand up. She looks at all the guards lined up,

               smiles sheepishly, and walks out of the pool.

     26        EXT - MOMENTS LATER - BIG MIKE'S                               26

               ALEX is standing outside of BIG MIKE's.    ROBBIE is walking

               out of the restaurant.

                                   ROBBIE

                             (Shaking his head)

                         Aokee's not going to be happy. Nobody

                         seems to know where these things are...

                                      ALEX

                                (smiling)

                         Yep.

                                (now laughing)

                                      ROBBIE

                         What?

                                   ALEX

                         There's no such thing as a table

                         stretcher or a left-handed coffee pot.

                                  ROBBIE

                        What a dirty trick.

                                   ALEX

                             (smiling)

                         It's just Aokee's way of giving you a

                         tour of the park without having to be

                         there. Consider it a rookie initiation.

                                   ROBBIE

                             (still mad)

                         Humph.

                                   ALEX

                         Time to make it up to you.    Come on.

               ALEX knocks loudly on the door.

               A teenage boy, DAVE in a BIG MIKE's uniform answers.

                                     DAVE

                         Alex!

                                   ALEX

                         Hey Davey...how 'bout two for two?

                                     DAVE

                         Malts?

                                    ALEX

                             (looks at ROBBIE)

                         Chocolate.

                             (ROBBIE nods)

               DAVE disappears for moment.

                                  ALEX (CONT'D)

                        Now, if he ever shows up at our back

                        door, we owe him chicken and smoothies.

                                   ROBBIE

                         But...don't we get an employee discount?

                         Shouldn't we go in the front?

                                   ALEX

                         Well...the discount is larger this way.

               ROBBIE is getting out money from his pocket, counting through

               it.

               DAVE shows up with two burgers and two malts, and hands them

               to ALEX, disappears and shuts the door quickly. ROBBIE is

               still staring at his money.

                                   ALEX (CONT'D)

                         Come on...let's go eat!

               They walk out of frame.

     28        INT -DAY AOKEE'S SURF AND SNACK SHACK                          28

               ALEX and ROBBIE are cleaning tables after another busy lunch.

               WE SEE that AOKEE is filling up a bucket, and getting a scrub

               brush, and heads out the doorway.

                                    ALEX

                         Oh boy.   Here we go.

                                     ROBBIE

                         What now?

                                   ALEX

                         Aokee. The pigeons have been taking

                         target practice on his trophy pedestal.

                         Come on.

               They exit out the same doorway as AOKEE.

               AOKEE is busily cleaning and cursing the pigeons.

                                    AOKEE

                              (speaking Hawaiian)

                          Stupid Pigeons. They should all die!

                                    ALEX

                              (to ROBBIE)

                          Happens every week.

                                   ROBBIE

                             (to AOKEE)

                         What is this thing for anyway?

                                    AOKEE

                          Someday, Robbie.   Someday.

               He keeps cleaning.

                                   ALEX

                             (to ROBBIE)

                         That stand is to display the coveted

                         Surfer King trophy.

                         Aokee seems to think that one day some

                         concessions kid with more courage than

                         brains is going to beat the lifeguards in

                         the annual Employee Olympics.

                                    ROBBIE

                          And what would this concessions kid have

                          to do?

                                    ALEX

                          Nothing, really. Just out surf the

                          strongest guard of them all in the

                          surfing competition. No big deal.

                                    ROBBIE

                          Has it ever happened?

                                    ALEX

                          A guard always wins the surf competition.

                          Know why?

                                    TOGETHER

                              (ROBBIE and ALEX)

                          Because concessions kids can't swim!

                                    AOKEE

                              (still cleaning)

                          Someday.

               They go back into AOKEE'S SURF AND SNACK SHACK.

     30        INT MOMENTS LATER -DAY- AOKEE'S SURF AND SNACK SHACK           30

               ROBBIE is now behind the counter making smoothies.      He puts

    Page 34 of 81

               them up and the two kids waiting take them and walk away.

               In walk AMY and KATIE.

                                   KATIE

                             (to ROBBIE)

                         Hi there.

                                   ROBBIE

                             (blinking, smiling)

                         Hello. On break?

                                    KATIE

                         Yeah.   Two Blue Crushes please.

                                      ROBBIE

                         Coming up.

               He shakes a mix container, blends it for about 5 seconds and

               pours it out into two cups. He then puts in two umbrellas

               with pineapple.

                                   AMY

                         Oooh. Umbrellas.       I've never gotten

                         umbrellas before.

                                   ROBBIE

                         These are only for VIP guests.

               AMY looks over to KATIE and rolls her eyes.

               ALEX arrives at this point, and decides to provide a

               distraction.

                                  ALEX

                        Amy. Have you ever seen the fabulous

                        Cummings and Robbins 2000-B?

                                   AMY

                             (shaking her head)

                         I don't think so.

               As he leads her back into the kitchen...

                                   ALEX

                         It's incredible.      It washes 2000 plates

                         an hour....

                                   KATIE

                             (to ROBBIE)

                         So... you're not from around here, huh?

                                   ROBBIE

                         California. I just moved here at the

                         beginning of the summer.

                                   KATIE

                         I'll bet California's nice.      I've never

                         been west of the mountains.

    Page 35 of 81

                                   ROBBIE

                         You'd love the ocean. And the sunsets

                         are incredible. You can almost hear the

                         sizzle as the sun drops into the ocean...

                             (daydreaming a bit)

                         Of course, we all know it doesn't drop

                         into the ocean.

                                     KATIE

                         No.

                            (pause)

                        I'm surprised you're not a guard, coming

                        from the ocean and all.

                                  ROBBIE

                        Let's just say I missed my chance, and

                        Alex saved me from a death worse than

                        fate. I was very nearly a trash rat.

                                  KATIE

                            (frowns)

                         Oh. Good save.

               ALEX has distracted AMY all he could and they return from the

               kitchen.

                                   AMY

                         Well. That was exciting. Maybe next

                         time you can show me how to scrub the

                         grill. Come on, Katie.

               They leave.

                                  ALEX

                            (to ROBBIE, interested)

                        Well...how'd you do?

                                   ROBBIE

                             (thinking)

                         Mmmm. I told her how beautiful the

                         California sunsets are.

                                   ALEX

                         Good job. You work fast. Hey it's time

                         for our break. Bring your swimsuit?

                                    ROBBIE

                         Yeah.   The Wave?

                                     ALEX

                         The Wave.    I love that water.

               ROBBIE looks confused.

                                   ALEX (CONT'D)

                         Can't swim. It's only three inches deep.

                                   ROBBIE

                             (grabbing his suit and a towel)

                         Ah ha! Let's go.

    Page 36 of 81

     31        EXT -MOMENTS LATER - THE WAVE AREA                             31

               ROBBIE and ALEX have their swimsuits on, and are in line to

               get on THE WAVE. ALEX is coaching ROBBIE.

                                   ALEX

                         Now, just take it easy, and don't expect

                         too much at first. When you wipe out,

                         your ride is done.

               ALEX is up now, and he grabs the board and jumps in. He is

               pretty good, but not nearly as good as the WAVE BUMS. He

               does a few tricks and wipes out. He gets up and walks up to

               the line to watch ROBBIE.

                                   ALEX (CONT'D)

                             (shouting)

                         Just ease into it.

               ROBBIE takes the board and looks around. He jumps full force

               onto the wave. It takes him just a moment to get the feel of

               the board, and then he is all over it, making the WAVE BUMS

               look like rookies. Spins, rolls, everything that can be done

               he does. Finally, the guard blows a whistle indicating that

               his time is up.

                                   ALEX (CONT'D)

                             (meeting him at the exit)

                         Gees. Where did you learn to do that?

                                   ROBBIE

                         I'm from Oceanside, California.    I was

                         born on a surfboard.

               They start walking back.

               They stop for a moment to look at Thunder Bay. Just then a

               wave spews out, and kids on tubes are screaming as they

               always do.

                                   ALEX

                         Think you could ride that?

                                    ROBBIE

                             (looking right into ALEX's

                              eyes)

                         In my sleep.

               ALEX just smiles.

     32        INT - LATER THAT DAY - AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK SHACK              32

               AOKEE is cleaning up behind the counter.    ALEX is grinning

               like the cat that ate the canary.

                                   AOKEE

                         What you so happy about?

                                   ALEX

    Page 37 of 81

                            (shaking his head)

                        You're not gonna believe it...

                                  AOKEE

                        Listen. Some guy came in today and try

                        to buy a sandwich and pay with a phone

                        card. Today I believe anything.

                                   ALEX

                         I took Robbie to The Wave today.

                                   AOKEE

                             (looking around)

                         What? He drown?

                                  ALEX

                        No. It turns out that he's from

                        Oceanside. California. You know, where

                        they always hold those surf competitions?

                                       AOKEE

                         Yeah.   So?

                                  ALEX

                        It turns out that he placed second in the

                        state high school finals for the

                        shortboard competition. As a Sophomore.

                                  AOKEE

                        Robbie.

                            (laughing in disbelief,

                             dismissive, then serious)

                        Robbie barely walk without help.

                                   ALEX

                         I saw it myself.      You wouldn't believe

                         it.

               We hear a loud CRASH from the kitchen.      AOKEE winces and

               gestures toward the kitchen.

                                   AOKEE

                         I don' believe it.      Our Robbie?

                                   ALEX

                         Our Robbie.

                                  AOKEE

                            (thinking)

                        If this true....this could be da year.

                                   ALEX

                         That's what I was thinking.

                                  AOKEE

                        Well, go get him. We need to make ready.

                        He not just walk in and win this thing.

                                   ALEX

                         You heard it. He's in the kitchen...

    Page 38 of 81

               ALEX goes into the back. AOKEE sits at a table. Robbie

               comes out of the kitchen wearing a dishwasher apron.

                                  AOKEE

                        Robbie, sit down. Alex, make up a

                        Volcano. This boy in training.

                                  ROBBIE

                            (sitting down, worried)

                        What did I spill now?

               WE HEAR the whine of a blender as ALEX is working on the

               Volcano Smoothie.

                                  AOKEE

                        Robbie, Alex tell me you are some kind of

                        surfer. This true?

                                  ROBBIE

                        I dunno. Yeah, surfing is usually how I

                        spend my summers.

                                   AOKEE

                         You know about Employee Olympics?

                                    ROBBIE

                         Yeah.   Some kind of trophy.

                                   AOKEE

                         Surfer King trophy. Very big.     Very

                         nice.

                             (looking down)

                         Concessions never win.

               ALEX arrives with the Volcano Smoothie. He turns a chair

               around and sits. They will gang up on him.

                                   ROBBIE

                         I dunno...seems kind of silly to me.

                                  ALEX

                        It's a big deal. Every girl     wants to date

                        you. Every guy wants to BE      you.

                        Special privileges...we all     wear standard

                        uniforms.   The Surfer King     gets to be

                        creative. You ever see the      cowboy hat

                        Cowboy wears?

                                  ROBBIE

                        It shouldn't be that hard...how good

                        could this Cowboy be?

                                  AOKEE

                        He very good. His family go to Hawaii

                        every year, two, three weeks. Good

                        surfer. If you do this, you need to see

                        Pipeman.

                         Pipeman?

                                   ALEX

                         He's a myth.

                                  AOKEE

                        Oh, no. Pipeman very real. Works here

                        in park. Low profile. You must find him

                        and convince him to teach you the secrets

                        of the Thunder Bay wave. This not the

                        ocean, surf boy.

                                   ALEX

                             (thinking)

                         Pipeman. The Banzai Pipeline. I get it.

                         Some kind of legendary surf champ. Where

                         do we find him?

                                  AOKEE

                        I only see him once, maybe twice. Stay

                        behind scenes. But here he is and find

                        him you must.

                            (to ROBBIE)

                        So. You do this?

               Robbie looks at them, thinking for a moment.

                                                                        CUT TO:

     33        INT -MOMENTS LATER - AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK SHACK                33

               WE SEE quarters going ding ding ding into the pay phone on

               AOKEE'S wall. The shot widens to reveal AOKEE is dumping

               quarters and ROBBIE is holding the phone. He puts it up to

               his ear.

                                  ROBBIE

                            (into phone)

                        Hello, Grandma? No, I'm fine. Listen,

                        Grandma...I need you to send me a few of

                        my things...

               AOKEE and ALEX are huddled around smiling.

     34        INT - DAY - BIG MIKE'S OFFICE                                  34

               BIG MIKE is standing, walking around as he speaks, TIFFANY is

               sitting. Clearly she is being scolded.

                                  BIG MIKE

                            (angry)

                        ....why you wouldn't believe the things

                        I've heard. Just stupid things. Cutting

                        in line. Demanding special treatment.

                        Oh, and how about this one:

                            (mimicking her)

                        Princesses don't carry trash.

                            (back to his voice)

                        I've often thought it was a mistake to

                        have you work here. Maybe I was right.

    Page 40 of 81

                                   TIFFANY

                             (trying to dance out of it)

                        Oh, daddy. You know how jealous people

                        get.

                                  BIG MIKE

                        I'd almost believe that. But I was behind

                        the First Aid station when you said the

                        "princess" line. This park exists

                        because the kids here work hard. They

                        need to be treated fairly. They need to

                        see you are just another lifeguard.

                                   TIFFANY

                             (protesting)

                         But I'm not just another lifeguard.

                                  BIG MIKE

                            (mad again)

                        You won't even be that if this continues.

                        If you want to keep coming here every day

                        and driving that little convertible of

                        yours, I need to see real, concrete

                        changes in your attitude.

                                      TIFFANY

                         All right.     What do you expect me to do?

                                  BIG MIKE

                        For one thing, start mingling with "the

                        commoners". You'd be amazed at how nice

                        some of the people who work here are.

                        Make some friends outside that little

                        group of yours. It's the work of the

                        average teenager here that puts food on

                        our table. Show some gratitude.

                                   TIFFANY

                             (thinking a moment)

                         Fine. I'll work it.

                                   BIG MIKE

                             (softening, but firm)

                         Good. Work on it. Please?

                                   TIFFANY

                             (nodding, but we don't believe

                              her)

                         Oh, Daddy. Don't worry about a thing.

     35        EXT MORNING - THE NEXT DAY - TIME SHACK                        35

               ROBBIE and ALEX hook up and grab their time cards. There is

               a banner hanging that says, "Employee Luau Tonight", and

               SKEETER and SNITCH have taken a 5 gallon bucket and are using

               it as a stepladder to attach something.

               SKEETER is on the bucket with a stapler in his hand. SNITCH

               hands up the hand-lettered magic marker addition, which

       Page 41 of 81

               SKEETER staples on to the bottom of the banner while SNITCH

               keeps a lookout.

               The addition says, "COME GET LEI'D".     They scamper off,

               laughing.

                                   ALEX

                             (looking up at the sign)

                         This will be good. Aokee throws a great

                         Luau.

                                   ROBBIE

                         I don't how much fun it will be.     With

                         Aokee hosting, we'll be working.

                                   ALEX

                         There'll still be time for fun. Most of

                         the work is setting up. Besides, we get

                         paid, too. When was the last time you

                         got paid to party?

               With that, ALEX punches in, as if to punctuate the line.

     36        EXT - NIGHT -   OUTSIDE AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK SHACK             36

               It is dark, but the place is lit up by little lights

               everywhere, Christmas lights in the fake palm trees, TIKI

               lights around AOKEE's, and lights lighting a stage where a

               band is playing, what else, surf music.

               Buffet tables line the area, and there is SMOOTHIE BAR set

               up. BIG MIKE himself is behind the bar making smoothies,

               while RICHARD is playing bass in the band. AOKEE is running

               around making sure all the buffet items are full. Everyone

               is wearing Leis, but the cheap plastic ones, except AOKEE and

               his staff, who have real ones flown in from Hawaii.

                                   AOKEE

                             (pouring out four smoothies to

                              ROBBIE and ALEX)

                         OK. You work hard, and we fine now.

                         Your time to party. Here they are.

                         Special Love Smoothies. Be careful!

                                   ALEX

                             (to ROBBIE)

                         These never fail.

               ALEX picks up two Leis from a box behind the counter. He and

               Robbie walk over to AMY and KATIE who are standing over near

               the buffet.

                                   ALEX (CONT'D)

                             (to ROBBIE, but if front of AMY

                              and Katie)

                         Now this will never do.

                                   ROBBIE

                             (agreeing)

                         I'm afraid you're right.     Something must

    Page 42 of 81

                         be done.

               ALEX and ROBBIE set the smoothies on a nearby table. They

               remove the cheap plastic Leis the girls are wearing. Then

               they put on the real ones they carried over. ALEX steps back

               to admire his work.

                                     ALEX

                         Oh, yes,    yes....

                                     ROBBIE

                         Perfect.    A work of art.

               The girls look at each other and smile. ALEX and ROBBIE grab

               the smoothies and hand two to the girls. AMY sips hers right

               away.

                                   AMY

                         I don't remember anything like this on

                         Aokee's menu.

                                     ROBBIE

                         They're..

                                   ALEX

                             (interrupting)

                         ..special smoothies. Fortunately, you

                         know people on the inside.

               Onstage, the band had finished a tune before the dialog began

               above. Now JAFFA steps up to the mike.

                                   JAFFA

                         We'd like thank Aokee and his crew for

                         hosting this evening's Luau.

               Everyone applauds, AOKEE waves. Alex raises a hand and waves

               off the accolade. ROBBIE nods and smiles as the AMY and

               KATIE clap as well.

                                   JAFFA (CONT'D)

                         We'd also like to bring Aokee up to sing

                         one of his Hawaiian specialties.

               Again, everyone claps and cheers him on.    AOKEE goes on

               stage.

                                   ALEX

                         You girls want to dance?

                                   KATIE

                             (grabbing ROBBIE's hand and

                              leading out to the dance

                              floor)

                         Sure.

               AMY shrugs yes and goes out with ALEX.

                                   AOKEE

                             (onstage)

    Page 43 of 81

                        Mahalo and Aloha. This song is sung on

                        my island for all young people in

                        love...or about to be. Is called E

                        O'Mai, or, You Are Mine.

               AOKEE begins singing the Hawaiian love song, "E O'Mai".      Many

               couples are dancing; it is a slow song.

               ALEX, of course, is a goof. He dances slow, but every once

               in a while executes a deep dip, much to AMY's terror.

               EDDIE is off to the edge of the dance floor, watching,

               longingly, and kind of swaying to the music. A couple of

               girls walk by and he does a magic trick for them.

               He holds both hands up, palms open to show he has nothing in

               his hands. He also gestures that he has no sleeves (he is

               wearing a tuxedo t-shirt). He reaches behind his back and

               pulls out a trick bouquet of flowers, but they don't quite

               open right, and are still unfolding as he holds them.

               EDDIE smiles weakly, he knows that isn't quite how it was

               supposed to go. The girls appear encouraging, but as they

               leave look at each other and giggle.

               We pick up ROBBIE and KATIE dancing.

                                  KATIE

                         So. How are things working out at

                         Aokee's?

                                   ROBBIE

                         Oh, he's great. Alex too. I thought

                         this summer was going to be a train

                         wreck, but it's not turning out too bad.

                                   KATIE

                         Well, of course this isn't California...

                                  ROBBIE

                        No, but it looks like I will get a chance

                        to do some surfing anyway.

                                   KATIE

                         Really.

                                   ROBBIE

                         Apparently there's some kind of surfing

                         contest and Aokee is all over me to

                         enter.

                                   KATIE

                         You mean the Surfer King?

                                   ROBBIE

                         You've heard of it?

                                  KATIE

                        It's all the other girls seem to talk

                        about. This is my first year, but

    Page 44 of 81

                         apparently it's a pretty big deal. Being

                         from Oceanside, you should have a good

                         chance.

                                   ROBBIE

                         We'll see. It seems kind of stupid to

                         me. A surfing contest in Colorado.

                            (laughing)

                        My friends back home would never believe

                        it.

               They continue to dance. WE SEE BIG MIKE talking to TIFFANY

               and gesturing broadly. TIFFANY is clearly not agreeing with

               what he is saying. COWBOY is nowhere to be seen. Suddenly she

               throws up her hands and marches over to the dance floor where

               EDDIE is standing alone, swaying a bit to the music.

               She whispers something in his ear, and EDDIE'S eyes get real

               big as she leads him by the hand to the middle of the dance

               floor. She wraps her arms around EDDIE and they dance, all

               the while glaring at her father.

               EDDIE knows a good thing when he sees it, and quickly settles

               in, Big Man on Campus. TIFFANY is taller than he is, so he

               happily puts his head on HER shoulder.

               BIG MIKE looks back at them, not happy with the way it

               happened, but satisfied.

               DOUG FITZGERALD (twenty bucks DOUG) is dancing with a girl

               when ALEX, doing some kind of fancy spin to AMY, bumps into

               him.

                                   DOUG

                             (to ALEX)

                         Alex. Got my twenty bucks?

                                  ALEX

                        Oh, Dougie. You know, I left my wallet

                        over in my locker. I'll see you before

                        we leave and get it to you then.

                                   DOUG

                         Yeah, sure.

                                   ALEX

                         You know, you could always come by

                         Aokee's and I could give it to you in

                         trade.

                                   DOUG

                         Cash money, Alex.   Cash money.

                                   ALEX

                         No problem.

               ALEX grabs AMY and swings her into another fancy move that

               leads them away from DOUG.

       Page 45 of 81

               The song ends, and everybody claps.     AOKEE bows.

                                  ROBBIE

                            (to KATIE)

                        Hey, listen. Alex told me about this

                        great spot on the other side of Thunder

                        Bay that looks down on the party, but

                        it's a little more quiet. Want to go for

                        a walk?

                                   KATIE

                         Sure.

               They pick up their smoothies and walk off into the night.

     37        EXT MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT - NORTH EDGE OF THUNDER BAY          37

               ROBBIE is walking on the seawall that separates the bay from

               the sunning area, tightrope style. KATIE walks next to him.

                                   KATIE

                         So...what made your folks pick up from

                         beautiful southern California and move to

                         Colorado?

                                   ROBBIE

                         Not both my folks.   Just my Mom.

                                   KATIE

                         Aha...trouble in paradise?

                                   ROBBIE

                         Let's just say my father had an eye for

                         his administrative assistant, and now

                         they're both somewhere in Mexico. Mom

                         got a job here, some of her family's

                         here, so they said "Colorady is the place

                         you outta be".

                                   KATIE

                         It could be worse.

                                   ROBBIE

                         Well, I must admit, I've met some very

                         nice people.

                             (looking down and smiling)

                         In California, the attitude's a little

                         different. Here, not everyone is out to

                         prove something. Seem's like everyone

                         just wants to have fun.

                                  KATIE

                        I have a theory. Sometimes it snows here

                        so hard, that it's a challenge just to

                        get to work or to school. Everything

                        shuts down for a day or so. If your car

                        gets stuck, people appear from nowhere to

                        help pull you out and get you back on the

                        road. Most people here don't just look

                        out for themselves. A lot of times,

    Page 46 of 81

                         they're looking out for you, too.

     38        EXT. MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT - CUSTOMER SERVICE KIOSK             38

               ALEX and AMY are inside the KIOSK.    ALEX is showing her how

               everything works.

                                   ALEX

                         All these switches feed sound throughout

                         the park. Which reminds me.

               He pulls out a CD and pops it into the CD Player and presses

               PLAY. He sees a flyswatter and begins waving it around like

               a sword.

                                   ALEX (CONT'D)

                         And this is for bad little girls who

                         don't know how to have fun.

               He begins swishing it around, AMY is giggling.

                                    ALEX (CONT'D)

                         Oops.   There....almost got you.

               AMY is dodging and laughing. ALEX closes in and seems like

               he will kiss her, but just starts gumming her neck, tickling

               her. AMY leans back laughing and WE SEE her back hits the

               volume knob on the amplifier.

     39        EXT. NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER GRAND PAVILION                       39

               They have reached   the area to the west of Thunder Bay. It is

               simply a concrete   pad that overlooks the party below. We

               hear "Paradise is   in Your Eyes" by Michael Peace, which

               begins with a lot   of jungle sound effects.

                                   KATIE

                             (looking down at the party)

                         You were right. This is nice.

                             (reacting to the jungle noises)

                         But not necessarily quieter.

                                   ROBBIE

                         Just a sec.

               He walks away slightly and gets on the radio.

                                   ROBBIE (CONT'D)

                         Hey, Alex. Give us break down here.

                         Turn down the sound effects.

     40        EXT. NIGHT - CUSTOMER SERVICE KIOSK                             40

               ALEX and AMY are kissing; she is up on the counter of the

               KIOSK.

                                   ALEX

                             (interrupting, but to AMY)

                         Uh oh. Sorry. Hold that thought.

    Page 47 of 81

               He grabs the radio.

                                    ALEX (CONT'D)

                             (into the radio)

                         I'm on it.

               He turns down the volume back to normal. He also flips a

               switch. They hear the tune now, and AMY jumps off the

               counter, stands there and smiles. ALEX does an over-the-top

               mambo moving to her and they start to slow dance.

     41        EXT. NIGHT - GRAND PAVILION                                    41

               ROBBIE has set down the radio, and is walking back to KATIE

               now, who is swaying to the music. He doesn't get too close

               to her, and actually stands off to her left.

               Since she has the room and is momentarily inspired, she

               begins a few dance moves, ballet, and then ballroom style.

               ROBBIE has seen this sort of thing before, and instinctively,

               almost without thinking steps in and becomes her dance

               partner. They proceed in a beautiful dance that almost seems

               rehearsed. Finally it occurs to them both.

                                   ROBBIE

                             (quizzically)

                         So where did you learn to dance like

                         this?

                                   KATIE

                             (smiling)

                         Eight years at Miss Vickie's Studio of

                         Dance. What surprises me is you.

                                   ROBBIE

                             (somewhat embarrassed, keeps

                              dancing)

                         Can you keep my deepest, darkest secret?

                                      KATIE

                         Of course.

                                  ROBBIE

                            (hesitantly)

                        When you grow up within spitting distance

                        of Hollywood, every mother seems to think

                        her child is the next Harrison Ford. So

                        when I was about 12, my Mom started

                        taking me to all these auditions for

                        things.

                                  KATIE

                        So are you the next Harrison Ford?

                                   ROBBIE

                         Some days I'm not even the next Robbie

                         Zirpollo.

               They continue to dance.    After a few moments...

        Page 48 of 81

                                    KATIE

                         ....and?

               They stop and walk over to the railing overlooking the party.

                                  ROBBIE

                        Turns out I get this part. They're

                        selling some dish soap or something, and

                        they think it will be magical to have

                        two twelve year old kids dancing ballroom

                        on this fantasy set with clouds and

                        everything. They lock this girl and I

                        into a dance studio with a choreographer

                        for two weeks, and then they shoot the

                        commercial.

                                   KATIE

                         Doesn't sound so terrible.     You certainly

                         learned how to dance.

                                   ROBBIE

                         Yeah, but when it came out everyone in

                         school saw it. I couldn't go anywhere

                         for six months without everyone in the

                         room laughing their heads off.

                                   KATIE

                             (touched, drawing closer)

                         I'm not laughing.

               They kiss, then return to dancing.

     42        EXT. MORNING - THE NEXT DAY - OUTSIDE AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK 42

               SHACK - SURF MUSIC BED

               WE SEE ALEX and ROBBIE discussing something; forming a plan.

               They are going to look for Pipeman. ALEX gestures in one

               direction, and ROBBIE takes off. ALEX goes in another.

               FUNHOUSE - SURF MUSIC BED

               ALEX walks up to the Guard, appears to ask a question.        The

               guard shakes his head "no".

               ALEX walks off.

     44        EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - GIFT SHOP - SURF MUSIC BED           44

               ROBBIE is talking to a cashier in the store.     She shakes her

               head 'no'. Robbie walks out hurriedly.

               ALEX is talking to Jaffa. JAFFA gestures wildly, as if

               telling some big mythical story, but at the end throws up his

               hands as if to say, "I don't know".

     46        EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - SOMEWHERE AT WATER WORLD -      46

               SURF MUSIC BED

               We are in pitch darkness. We hear the sound of heavy

               scraping metal. Lights shine and we are looking up through a

               manhole cover being removed. ROBBIE bends over the hole and

               hollers "PIPEMAN" and peers in. He shakes his head

               negatively and moves on.

     47        EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - BIG MIKE'S - SURF MUSIC BED 47

               We are at the back door to Big Mike's. ALEX knocks, and the

               same kid as before, DAVE, pops his head out. ALEX appears to

               ask a question, DAVE goes back in as ALEX waits. DAVE comes

               out again and gestures, "no one knows". ALEX starts to leave,

               but turns back and asks something else. DAVE disappears and

               comes back with a burger. ALEX shrugs, and walks away

               unwrapping and eating the burger.

     48        EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - BACK OF SOME BUILDING           48

               ROBBIE sees a door marked, "EMPLOYEES ONLY". He looks down

               at his employee ID and shrugs and goes in. As he enters we

               see he is pushed out by some unknown force. Out the open

               door comes "Wally" the Water World mascot, who walks off.

               Robbie has been knocked to the ground and looks up, shaking

               his head. He gets up and walks off.

     49        EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - BACK OF SOME BUILDING - SURF49

               MUSIC BED

               Now it is ALEX who has separately come upon the same door,

               not knowing ROBBIE has already been there. He enters, and

               the door remains open. We hear girls screaming and he exits

               quickly, followed by a volley of thrown girl's underwear,

               swimsuits and towels.

     50        INT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - THUNDER BAY PUMPHOUSE - SURF50

               MUSIC BED

               This room is creepy. It is full of loud pumps and large

               pipes. ROBBIE is making his way through a labyrinth of

               piping and gauges and the like. He peers and sees a head

               with a red scarf, but it moves out of view.  Surf music

               fades.

               There is a constant whine of the pumps. ROBBIE moves further

               in and finally comes across a man holding a large pipewrench,

               with his back to him. He is working to tame a small leak.

                                   ROBBIE

                             (quietly)

                         Hello?

               No reaction.

                                   ROBBIE (CONT'D)

                             (loudly this time)

                         Hello?

    Page 50 of 81

               This startles and kind of angers PIPEMAN.

                                   PIPEMAN

                        Hey.   You're not supposed to be in here.

                                   ROBBIE

                         Yeah, sorry. Are you Pipeman?

                                   PIPEMAN

                             (recovering from the startle)

                         Not on purpose.

                         I guess some people call me Pipeman.

                         'Spose it's better than Carl.

                                   ROBBIE

                         So you're real name's Carl?

                                  PIPEMAN

                        No. I just said Pipeman was a better

                        name than Carl.

                                 ROBBIE

                        Oh. Well, my name's Robbie.      I work at

                        Aokee's.

                                    PIPEMAN

                         Oh. OK.   What the hell you doin' down

                         here?

                                   ROBBIE

                         I need your help.

                                   PIPEMAN

                         That scrubsink at Aokee's leakin' again?

                         Gees, I knew we shoudda replaced...

                                  ROBBIE

                        It's not the scrub sink. I need your

                        help. I'm competing in the Employee

                        Olympics. With your advanced surfing

                        experience, Aokee thought you might be

                        able to help me.

                                   PIPEMAN

                             (to himself)

                         Everybody wants to be the Surfer King.

                             (to ROBBIE)

                         What advanced surfing experience?

                                   ROBBIE

                         Well, you know. "Pipeman"? Hawaii's

                         North Shore? Surfing the pipeline?

                                  PIPEMAN

                        Ohhh. Bad news, kid. I hate to

                        disappoint you, but this is the reason

                        they call me Pipeman. I'm the plumber

                        around here.

               PIPEMAN holds up the large wrench.

    Page 51 of 81

                                  ROBBIE

                        Oh, boy. See, I'm from California, and

                        I can surf, I just don't know what to

                        expect from the wave on Thunder Bay.

                        I...I was just hoping you could help, I

                        really am sorry for bothering you.

               ROBBIE begins walking out, dejected.    PIPEMAN looks at him,

               and feels sorry for him.

                                  PIPEMAN

                        Wait a minute, kid. I do know a little

                        about surfing. I also know a lot about

                        the wave here. What exactly are you

                        looking for from me?

                                   ROBBIE

                             (perking up)

                        I need a mentor; you know like in Karate

                        Kid.

                                  PIPEMAN

                        Karate Kid. He works at Big Mike's

                        doesn't he?

                                   ROBBIE

                         No, no it's a movie.

                                  PIPEMAN

                        Never seen it. Don't know much about

                        this mentor thing. How's it work?

                                  ROBBIE

                        Generally, you, as mentor, draw on some

                        personal religious philosophy to first

                        intimidate, and then later inspire me.

                        What religion are you?

                                   PIPEMAN

                             (proudly)

                         I'm Norman.

                                   ROBBIE

                         Ah, Brigham Young and all that.

                                  PIPEMAN

                        No, no NNNNORM-AN. We follow the big fat

                        guy on Cheers reruns.

                                  ROBBIE

                        Okay...and your belief structure....

                                  PIPEMAN

                        Usually involves a lot of beer and corn

                        nuts, but I don't think that's gonna work

                        here.

                            (thinking)

                        Tell you what.

                        Meet me at Thunder Bay tomorrow morning,

       Page 52 of 81

                        eight a.m., bring your board and we'll

                        work something out.

                                  ROBBIE

                            (happily)

                        Great, perfect. Thanks. I won't let you

                        down.

                            (walking away, muttering to

                             himself)

                        What the heck is a corn-nut?

     51        EXT. MORNING - THE NEXT DAY - THUNDER BAY                      51

               WE SEE Thunder Bay looking east. AOKEE and ALEX are setting

               up lawn chairs. AOKEE is lathering on suntan lotion, and

               puts on a large straw hat. ALEX puts sun block cream on his

               nose, and they both sit on the lawn chairs. They both have

               large smoothies.

               ROBBIE appears with his surfboard, and lays it up against the

               east fence at Thunder Bay. PIPEMAN arrives carrying a small

               device in a plastic ziplock bag.

               ROBBIE approaches PIPEMAN.

                                   ROBBIE

                         Hi!  Glad you could make it.

                             (pointing to PIPEMAN's hand)

                         What's that?

                                   PIPEMAN

                         This is how I trigger the wave.

                                      ROBBIE

                         With that?     A garage door clicker?

                                  PIPEMAN

                        What did you think? Waves just happen?

                        This is Colorado, kid. Now get your

                        board and get in the water.

               Robbie gets his board and jumps into Thunder Bay, paddling

               over to the narrow side where the wave begins.

               PIPEMAN goes down the stairs leading to near where ROBBIE has

               positioned himself.

                                   PIPEMAN (CONT'D)

                         You sure that's where you want to be?

                                   ROBBIE

                         Should be about right. Aren't you

                         getting in? Where's your board?

                                    PIPEMAN

                         Mentors don't get wet. I looked it up.

                             (pressing the clicker)

                         Get ready.

               A wave comes and ROBBIE begins paddling.     He misses it,

       Page 53 of 81

               splashes the water angrily and turns back to paddle to

               position again. AOKEE and ALEX look at each other nervously.

                                   PIPEMAN (CONT'D)

                         Want to know what you did wrong?

                                  ROBBIE

                            (mad)

                        Just gimme another wave.

                                   PIPEMAN

                         Oakey doakey.

               Another wave comes. ROBBIE paddles furiously and misses it

               again. Now he's really angry.

                                  ROBBIE

                            (tersely)

                        Okay. Please. Tell me what I did wrong.

                                   PIPEMAN

                         You're in the wrong position. The wave

                         doesn't crest that soon. Move ten feet

                         further away from the back wall.

                                    ROBBIE

                             (to himself)

                         The ocean never had a back wall.

                             (to Pipeman)

                         Thank you.

               ROBBIE paddles over to the spot suggested by PIPEMAN. AOKEE

               and ALEX are now sitting on the edge of the lawn chairs

               anxiously awaiting the next wave. It comes and ROBBIE

               catches it easily and begins riding it aggressively. He has

               a good run and kicks out at the end.

               AOKEE and ALEX high-five.

                                   ALEX AND AOKEE

                             (together)

                         Yeee-haww.

               They settle back into their chairs to absorb some sun.

     52        INT. DAY AOKEE'S SURF AND SNACK SHACK - DAY                    52

               AOKEE is behind the counter finishing up making a smoothie.

               RICHARD, head lifeguard is on the other side; he will get the

               smoothie.

                                   RICHARD

                             (grinning)

                         So. I hear he's pretty good.     Haven't

                         seen him myself yet.

                                   AOKEE

                             (concerned, covering)

                         Good? Good at what? Who you mean?

    Page 54 of 81

                                  RICHARD

                        Come on. Your ringer from California.

                        Everyone says he's gonna give Cowboy a

                        run for his money.

                                     AOKEE

                         Robbie?    Robbie barely walk without help.

               We hear a loud CRASH from the kitchen.

                                     RICHARD

                         Gees!

                                     AOKEE

                         Ha!

               AOKEE gestures back towards the kitchen.

                                   AOKEE (CONT'D)

                         Your Surfer King. We just make a good

                         show. Your boy have nothing to worry

                         about.

                                   RICHARD

                         You know I'd feel a lot better if you

                         hadn't taken most of my money in that

                         poker game last Friday night.

                                   AOKEE

                             (dismissive)

                         Poker? Not an island game.     I no good.

                                   RICHARD

                            (nods)

                        Right. Tell you what. Sight unseen even

                        money, twenty dollars on Cowboy.

                                   AOKEE

                         You want to bet with me? Take my twenty

                         dollars, just like that? Humph. Not

                         worth the trouble, twenty dollars. Now,

                         maybe a hundred...

                                   RICHARD

                         A hundred bucks...

               ANOTHER CRASH from the kitchen, this time pots & pans.

                                   AOKEE

                             (to kitchen)

                         Robbie!

                                   RICHARD

                         OK, a hundred bucks.

               They slap hands to seal the deal.    RICHARD leaves, grinning

               and shaking his head.

                                     AOKEE

                               (to kitchen)

                         Robbie?   That you?   Come out here.

                                  ROBBIE

                            (entering from kitchen)

                        Sorry, dude, that tray was way off

                        balance.

                                  AOKEE

                        Robbie, our secret getting out.     You

                        practice too good.

                                   ROBBIE

                             (happy)

                         I'm really getting the hang of that wave.

                                      AOKEE

                         Fall more.     Make good show.

                                  ROBBIE

                            (thinking)

                        I'll try to remember to look and see

                        who's watching.

                                   AOKEE

                             (pours the rest of RICHARD's

                              smoothie)

                         Good. Here, have a smoothie. You too

                         skinny to surf good.

               ROBBIE smiles and takes the smoothie back to the kitchen.

     53        EXT EARLY MORNING. - THUNDER BAY                               53

               ROBBIE and PIPEMAN are in the middle of a practice session.

               PIPEMAN is at the side, ROBBIE is in the water on his board.

                                   PIPEMAN

                             (gesturing)

                         OK, now this time, get up on the board

                         more quickly. This is a wave pool and

                         this wave dissipates quickly. You only

                         have a little time to show your stuff.

                                   ROBBIE

                         How will the judging work?

                                  PIPEMAN

                        You get a possible ten points. Three for

                        your surfing, three for your style and

                        four for the judge's overall impression

                        of your ride. No one's ever gotten a

                        ten...I'm not really sure why.

                                   ROBBIE

                         You've seen the competition.     What does

                         everybody do?

                                   PIPEMAN

                         Everybody just surfs, man and tries not

                         to fall. The big reason Cowboy's done so

       Page 56 of 81

                         well is he goes to Hawaii for a couple

                         weeks every year. But there he's mostly

                         a longboarder. Your job is to figure out

                         how to make the most outta this little

                         wave.

                                    ROBBIE

                         OK.   I'm ready.

               The wave comes and ROBBIE catches it and surfs it hard,

               kicking up high at the end.

     54        EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - HILL ABOVE THUNDER BAY          54

               WE SEE COWBOY and TIFFANY standing overlooking Thunder Bay.

               COWBOY has binoculars and is looking through them.

                                   COWBOY

                         He's pretty good, I'll give him that.

                                   TIFFANY

                             (concerned)

                         How good?

                                  COWBOY

                        If I have an off day, he could win.

                                   TIFFANY

                             (really concerned)

                         That's terrible. You're the Surfer King.

                                   COWBOY

                         Well, some days you get the wave, and

                         some days the wave gets you.

                                   TIFFANY

                         This can't happen.   What are we gonna do?

                                   COWBOY

                         I don't know what you're going to do, but

                         as me for me, I'm gonna schedule some

                         practice time of my own.

                                   TIFFANY

                         This may take a lot more than extra

                         practice.

                                   COWBOY

                         Well, I don't know what else you expect.

                         I'll go out and do my best. If that's

                         not enough, it's not enough.

               TIFFANY grabs the binoculars and stares down at Thunder Bay.

               WE SEE gears turning in her head.

     55        EXT. MORNING - THE NEXT DAY - CUSTOMER SERVICE KIOSK           55

               ROBBIE and Alex are walking by.   JAFFA sees them.

                                    JAFFA

    Page 57 of 81

                         Hey, surfer boy! I got fifty bucks at

                         three to one! Don't let me down, mon.

                                  ROBBIE

                            (to JAFFA)

                        Hey Jaffa. NO worries.

                            (to ALEX, shocked)

                        People are betting on me?

                                  ALEX

                        Just a little friendly pool. No big

                        deal. Helps make this more interesting.

                        Concessions never had a chance before...

                                   ROBBIE

                         I've seen this Cowboy practice. His

                         style is more longboard, and this is a

                         shortboard wave, but he's still pretty

                         good. I could lose you know.

               Two concessions girls are walking by them.

                                    CONCESSIONS GIRLS

                             (together)

                         Hi Robbie!

                                    ROBBIE

                         How ya doin'

                              (to Alex after they have gone

                               by)

                         See. How come everyone knows me by sight

                         now?

                                  ALEX

                        Ah, you're the next big thing. You'll

                        survive it. The Employee Olympics are

                        only a week away. What happens is we

                        have this big opening ceremony where each

                        team chooses a theme and we're judged on

                        our spirit. Then different teams compete

                        in contests that test their Water World

                        skills. The next morning it all ends

                        with the surf contest. You ready?

               Another group of concession girls calls ROBBIE from one of

               the snack bars. He waves.

                                   ROBBIE

                         I suppose. I've been working out a

                         strategy to use if Cowboy has a real good

                         day. It's risky...

               Just then they both nearly run headlong into TIFFANY.

                                   TIFFANY

                         Well, hello Robbie.

                                   ROBBIE

                             (surprised)

                         You know me?

    Page 58 of 81

                                   TIFFANY

                         Of course I know you. It's my father's

                         park, I try get to know everyone.

                                   ALEX

                             (interrupting, eager)

                         I'm Alex!

                                  TIFFANY

                        Yes, I'm sure you are.

                            (ignoring ALEX, back to Robbie)

                        It's been a while since I've been to

                        Aokee's. Do you suppose if I come down

                        in a little while you could make some of

                        that special chicken, what is it?

                                   ROBBIE

                         The best teriyaki east of the Pacific.

                                  TIFFANY

                        Yes...and one those smoothies I hear so

                        much about?

                                    ROBBIE

                             (stunned)

                         Well, sure. I'll be working all

                         afternoon.

                                  TIFFANY

                        It's a date then.    See you later!

               She walks off. ROBBIE just stands there. ALEX starts

               walking, then comes back. Finally ALEX pushes him on the

               shoulder.

                                   ALEX

                         Come on, we gotta get back.

                                   ROBBIE

                             (still shocked)

                         Yes. Yes we do.

     56        INT. DAY AOKEE'S SURF AND SNACK SHACK                          56

               AOKEE is wiping the counter alone.    HE turns toward the

               kitchen...

                                   AOKEE

                         Alex! We need more large smoothie cups

                         out here!

               AOKEE continues cleaning up. ALEX shows up with a load of

               cups, AOKEE takes them and starts placing then.

                                  AOKEE (CONT'D)

                            (to ALEX)

                        Look at that.

               WE SEE in a far corner of AOKEE's TIFFANY and ROBBIE in an

       Page 59 of 81

               animated, engaging conversation.

                                   AOKEE (CONT'D)

                         Second time this week. Our boy Big Man

                         on Campus, huh?

                                   ALEX

                         Big something. I hope he knows how to

                         work without a net.

                                   AOKEE

                         Well. We all grow up sometime. He not

                         drop a tray of dishes in days. Something

                         going right.   You think he ready?

                                   ALEX

                         I guess we'll both find out on Sunday.     I

                         sure hope so.

               WE SEE TIFFANY and ROBBIE again, and TIFFANY is laughing

               loudly at some joke ROBBIE has made.

     57        EXT NEAR SUNSET - TIME SHACK                                   57

               ROBBIE, ALEX, AMY and KATIE are clocking out for the day.

               ROBBIE clocks out first. TIFFANY drives up in her

               convertible.

                                   TIFFANY

                             (waving him over)

                         Robbie!

               ROBBIE goes over to talk to her.    WE SEE him go around to the

               passenger side.

                                   ROBBIE

                             (shouting)

                         Alex! I won't need a ride tonight after

                         all. Tiff's taking me home!

               ROBBIE jumps in and they drive away. ALEX, AMY and KATIE are

               still standing on the porch of the TIME SHACK, shocked at

               what they've seen.

                                   ALEX

                             (disbelief)

                         Tiff?

                                   AMY

                             (grossed out)

                         Tiff?

                                   KATIE

                             (forlorn, stunned)

                         Tiff.

               WE SEE ROBBIE and TIFFANY drive out the gate.     We see KATIE

               walk slowly out of the park alone.

               As she is walking, we flash back to scenes of KATIE and

       Page 60 of 81

               ROBBIE together, dancing and laughing. This time the dance

               moves to the song of Allison Krause's "New Favorite".

               We take a final look at KATIE with the setting sun at her

               back and see she is crying.

     58        EXT. EARLY MORNING. - SURF'S UP WAVE POOL EAST SIDE            58

               We see the rising sun behind AOKEE's head as he raises a

               conch shell and blows it like a horn. He is dressed like a

               Hawaiian prince.

               As the shot widens it reveals six males and two females

               dressed in Hawaiian native garb. ROBBIE And ALEX are among

               several drummers with bamboos sticks in their hands that

               provide percussion for the Hawaiian war dance.

                                    AOKEE

                          Aie, noka moka kei kai ke alo.

               The drums begin and the male dancers, carrying spears begin

               the Hawaiian war dance. The drummers sing the Hawaiian folk

               tune "No ka moku Kiakahi Ke Aloha".

               There are about 100 concessions kids in regular uniform

               sitting cross-legged behind them, clapping the beat in

               unison.

               The MALE DANCERS circle each other in time to the beat,

               gesturing a story the seems to involve some invading army.

               The war dance progresses until the invading warriors are

               defeated and the folk song ends. At the end, the kids

               sitting behind raise their hand and shout.

                                    CONCESSIONS GIRLS AND BOYS

                          Concessions! Concessions! Concessions!

               Looking to the south side of the pool, we see about 50

               grounds kids sitting in rows. In our foreground there are

               six large trash cans, with toilet plungers arranged next to

               them, 2 each.

               To our left are a line of six grounds kids in army fatigues

               carrying brooms as if rifles. The lead kid shouts:

                                     LEAD MARCHER

                          Company!   Forward, march.

               THE DRILL team marches into full view. The grounds kids

               behind clap the march beat. The marchers stop in front of

               the line of trash cans.

                                     LEAD MARCHER (CONT'D)

                          Company!   Halt!

               They do.

                                    LEAD MARCHER (CONT'D)

                          Present Arms!

    Page 61 of 81

               The brooms come off their shoulders and are held forward.

                                         LEAD MARCHER (CONT'D)

                            Company!

                                         MARCHERS

                            Yes sir.

                                      LEAD MARCHER

                            Order arms.

               They begin a routine practiced with brooms, in a cadence,

               clapped by the grounds kids behind them.

                                   LEAD MARCHER (CONT'D)

                         What do you do if it's wet and not yours?

                                      MARCHERS

                                (in cadence)

                            Don't touch it! Don't touch it!

                                      LEAD MARCHER

                            How do you deal with a full can of trash?

                                         MARCHERS

                            We empty!     We empty!

                                         LEAD MARCHER

                            Sound off!

                                      MARCHERS

                            Trash Rats!

                                         LEAD MARCHER

                            Again!

                                      MARCHERS

                            Trash Rats!

                                      LEAD MARCHER

                            Sound off, Trash Rats.

                                      MARCHERS

                            Trash rats! Trash Rats!

               They stop.     Their brooms are raised over their heads.

                                         LEAD MARCHER

                            Company!     Brooms Ho!

               They allow their brooms to fall to their right side and march

               to the trash cans. They pull out bright blue ski masks, a la

               BLUE MAN GROUP, and pick up the toilet plungers. The lead

               marcher holds his plunger high and shouts.

                                         LEAD MARCHER (CONT'D)

                            Company!     Begin!

               He counts a four beat rhythm and they begin a BLUE MAN/STOMP

               like drum routine with the trash cans.

    Page 62 of 81

               Two grounds kids in regular grounds uniforms approach holding

               steel trash can lids by the handles (with gloves). These

               become drums as well as two of the drummers switch from trash

               can to can lids using the stick side of the toilet plunger as

               the drumstick.

               A competition erupts from the left and right sides of the

               line as they each set a beat and then the other matches.

               Finally, a show of unity as both sides join back into the

               beat for an ending flourish.

               They pick up their brooms and turn their attention to the

               kids behind them. They begin to march in place and the seated

               grounds kids clap for the tempo.

                                   LEAD MARCHER (CONT'D)

                             (to the seated GROUNDS KIDS)

                         What do you do when the table's a mess?

                                   GROUNDS KIDS

                             (together)

                         We wipe it! We wipe it!

                                   LEAD MARCHER

                         What do you do when a toilet's stopped

                         up?

                                   GROUNDS KIDS

                         We plunge it! We plunge it!

                                      LEAD MARCHER

                         Sound off!

                                      LEAD MARCHER

                         Sound off!

                                   GROUNDS KIDS

                         Trash rats!

                                   LEAD MARCHER

                         Sound off trash rats!

                                   GROUNDS KIDS

                         Trash rats! Trash rats!

               They clap and cheer, and settle back down to sit.

               All is quiet now. WE SEE concessions kids sitting, grounds

               kids sitting and we look to the west side of the pool and see

               lifeguards sitting. Everyone is looking around.

               Suddenly two lifeguards dressed as Roman Soldiers appear with

               horns. They bellow a Roman Call to Action, and two Roman

               drummers lead a column of other lifeguards.

       Page 63 of 81

               First we see female guards dressed in togas filing in. Behind

               them are six gladiators with swords and shields, marching.

               They are followed by one female lifeguard with a basket of

               rose petals. She is throwing them into the path of the next

               group to enter.

               Next we see six more guards dressed as slaves carrying

               COWBOY, who is sitting up on a First Aid backboard. HE is

               wearing laurel leaves and a toga, he is obviously Cesar. On

               the backboard is also the surfer king trophy.

               They all approach the area in front of the seated guards, and

               rearrange themselves so that COWBOY has a good view of the

               gladiators. The drummers count a cadence that sets the pace

               for a simulated battle between the gladiators.

               The simulated battle rages until three of the gladiators are

               on their knees before the three victorious gladiators. The

               victorious gladiators hold their swords over the fallen ones,

               and look to COWBOY for a yea or nay.

               COWBOY generously waves and makes a thumbs up signal, and the

               swords are put away. The seated lifeguards all raise their

               fists and shout.

                                   LIFEGUARDS

                             (together)

                         Lifeguards! Lifeguards!     Lifeguards!

               The guards holding COWBOY set him down in front of an

               elevated platform that has a microphone..

               COWBOY picks up the surfer king trophy and walks to the

               platform. He sets the trophy on a table next to the

               microphone, arranging it carefully.

               We see now there is a large banner hanging at the back of the

               wave pool that says "WATER WORLD WELCOMES EMPLOYEE

               OLYMPIANS".

               COWBOY moves to the microphone and raises his arm in a regal

               manner and speaks.

                                   COWBOY

                             (to all)

                         Let the games...begin!

               The seated crowd now stands and cheers loudly. We see a

               group of three people, two male and one female, adults we

               will later identify as JUDGES. They nod approvingly and

               write something down on their clipboards. We see BIG MIKE

               near them, smiling broadly.

     59        EXT. LATER THAT DAY - SURF'S UP WAVE POOL EAST SIDE            59

               We see that the lounge chairs have been removed and the area

               is clear. There are scattered squashed up pieces of white

               paper lying about.

       Page 64 of 81

               We look to the south and see that there are three boy/girl

               teams with one of their legs tied together, like a three

               legged race.

               The rub here is one team member has the dustpan and the other

               team member has the broom. A JUDGE triggers a starter pistol

               and they are off.

               The lifeguard team falls almost immediately, and the grounds

               team takes a early lead over the concessions team, who are

               trying to figure the dustpan/broom operation out. The two

               grounds people work tightly together and quickly advance.

               The lifeguards have gotten back up and are hobbling up to

               their first piece of trash. Concessions has figured out the

               dustpan, but are still well behind the grounds kids.

               Finally, the grounds kids win, with concessions up second,

               and lifeguards trailing in third. The judges note the finish

               on their clipboards.

     60        EXT. LATER THAT DAY - THUNDER BAY                              60

               We see three male participants standing in the shallow end of

               Thunder Bay, One red suit (lifeguard) one blue suit

               (concessions) and one green suit (grounds)

               A JUDGE on the rise to the west of Thunder Bay blows an air

               horn to start the race. They all rush into the bay and begin

               swimming furiously.

               The guard takes the lead quickly, followed not far behind by

               the grounds kid. The concessions kid is working hard and

               splashing a lot but not getting very far.

               As the guard reaches the back wall, he does an underwater

               racing turn and swims back toward the point where they

               started. Right behind him, the smaller grounds kid does the

               same thing.

               As they are returning, they pass the concessions kid, who

               still is splashing a lot but not going fast. After they pass

               him he stops, as he is tired out.

               Momentarily he can't even tread water any more, and a guard

               watching from the sidelines jumps in and pulls him out. The

               swimming guard has beaten the grounds kid, the concessions

               kid never finishes.

     61        EXT LATER THAT DAY - SURF'S UP WAVE POOL SOUTH SIDE            61

               There are three lines set up with several participants. It

               is a relay race, with the baton replaced by a tray full of

               drinks in paper cups, water. The colors indicate again

               concessions, guards and grounds.

               The race is already in full swing, with concessions in the

               lead. The last group of relayers are now getting their

               trays, and concessions is way ahead.

       Page 65 of 81

               Everyone is cheering their team on. The final pass is made

               to SARAH who works for AOKEE's. She takes the tray and moves

               gracefully to the final stop. There is a small table on

               which the drinks must be placed.

               She is clearly going to win when she suddenly stops.

               All concessions kids are shocked and plead her to go on.

               She does a nifty and graceful around the back maneuver with

               the tray, proceeds to the table, and sets down the drinks,

               tipping the tray sideways to show no water has been spilled.

               The JUDGES scribble furiously.

     62        EXT. LATER THAT DAY - AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK SHACK               62

               Three picnic tables are set up in front of AOKEE's. WE dolly

               past each one to see that they are cluttered indentically

               with what appears to be the leftovers from lunch for four.

               Behind each table is a team of two guards, concessions and

               grounds kids.

               A JUDGE blows a whistle and we begin by looking at the

               lifeguard team.

               It is a boy and a girl and the girl is not too keen on this.

               They bring a trash can with them and begin gingerly clearing

               the table, acting as if they are afraid to get their hands

               dirty.

               We dolly left to see the concessions team a little ahead of

               the guard team.

               We dolly further left to reveal a grounds kid in a full rain

               suit with a face shield.

               A tremendous force of water is clearing the table into the

               trash can which the rain-suited grounds kid is holding at

               it's end.

               We dolly further left to see EDDIE in full army fatigues with

               safety goggles on and wearing the biggest super-soaker water

               gun in the history of man.

               The table is quickly cleared, and at the same time washed.

               EDDIE holds up the business end of the Super-Soaker gun and

               blows imaginary smoke from it's barrel, like an old Western

               gunfighter.

               The JUDGES take notes.

     63        EXT. LATER THAT DAY - SURF'S UP WAVE POOL                      63

               The three different teams are gathered in groups waiting for

               the next challenge. One of each team is in full sweats,

               color coordinated by team.

               ALEX is the one in the sweats for concessions. Slowly the

               sweats people walk into the pool about waist deep and lay

    Page 66 of 81

               down.

               The grounds kid is the littlest guy of all.

               A JUDGE blows a whistle and four members of each team run

               into the water and drag their now soaked sweat suited

               teammate out of the water. They lie them down on a clear

               area and begin CPR.

               The guards have a nifty little plastic device that lets them

               blow air into the mouth of their victim, and they roll him

               quickly on his side to clear water and back to begin CPR.

               They are fast and efficient, and clearly expertly trained.

               We move left to see the grounds kids, knowledgeable but

               inexperienced. One girl is using her hands to provide a

               seals over the mouth of her "victim" and another is clumsily

               pumping his chest while the others try to keep a count while

               reading some kind of instruction card..

               We move again to see the concessions kids, who are in

               trouble. ALEX is lying there dying, and they are arguing

               about who has to breathe into his mouth. They form a circle

               over him, pointing and arguing.

               Finally they all just walk off and ALEX is still lying on the

               ground, eyes rolled back and twitching convulsively in a

               hilarious death scene.

               The JUDGES take their notes.

     64        EXT LATER THAT DAY - IN FRONT OF THE CANNING COMPANY           64

               Once again three teams representing the three competing

               factions. Large stainless steel pots are bubbling on three

               propane cooking stands in front of the concession.

               The teams each have three members in cooking aprons, again,

               color coded. One from each team is stirring the team's chili

               while the others watch the JUDGES anxiously.

               Lines are forming in front of each pot, with people in line

               each carrying a paper chili bowl, but holding back, deferring

               to the JUDGES. The JUDGES are each carrying three styro cups

               in which to receive the chili.

               They each get a portion from the guard team and take a sip.

               They smile politely to the cooks, but turn around and spit

               the chili back into the cup as delicately as possible, almost

               as if throwing up. A concessions kid is there with a tray of

               waters, which they quickly take advantage of.

               They move on to the grounds team. They get their portions

               and taste the chili and nod, not bad.

               They take another sip of water to clear their palate and move

               on to the concessions team. The portions are proudly

               scooped.

               They take a taste, smile and take some more.     They huddle for

    Page 67 of 81

               a moment and then place a blue ribbon on the concessions pot.

               The lines quickly rearrange and merge themselves so that

               everyone is in line for the concessions pot.

     65        EXT LATER THAT DAY - SURF'S UP WAVE POOL EAST SIDE             65

               An obstacle course has been set up, and the event provides a

               background to the dialogue that follows. AOKEE has some

               papers, and is talking to ALEX and ROBBIE.

                                  AOKEE

                            (looking through the papers)

                        This isn't good.

                            (looking at ALEX and ROBBIE)

                        It's the same as every year. Pretty much

                        a dead heat going into the surf

                        championship tomorrow morning.

                                   ALEX

                         I can't believe those guys screwed up the

                         CPR.

                                   ROBBIE

                         Hard to blame them. No one told them

                         they had to put their mouth on yours

                         until the last minute. Yuck.

                                   ALEX

                         Bunch of babies.

                                   AOKEE

                             (to ROBBIE)

                         It's going to be up to you. We slip a

                         little. You have to make up. That

                         trophy need a new home.

               They look over at the obstacle course where a tiny grounds

               kid is jumping up and down and raising his arms ROCKY-style.

                                   AOKEE (CONT'D)

                         You need to make up. You ready? Tomorrow

                         morning last event. You our last hope.

               ROBBIE just looks at both of them nods and sighs heavily as

               the other grounds kids surround our winner in the background.

               AOKEE and ALEX walk off. Suddenly TIFFANY appears.

                                      TIFFANY

                         Hi Robbie.

                                  ROBBIE

                            (shy but still very much

                             smitten)

                         Oh. Hey.

                                   TIFFANY

                         How's your team doing?

                                   ROBBIE

                        Uh.   OK, I guess.      Kind of a tie.

    Page 68 of 81

                                  TIFFANY

                        Well, I think you're going to take care

                        of that tomorrow morning. In fact, I've

                        planned a little celebration in advance.

                        We're going to this incredible party up

                        in the foothills at some friends of mine.

                                  ROBBIE

                            (intrigued)

                        Party, huh? That sounds like fun.       I

                        have to work until nine tonight.

                                  TIFFANY

                        That's perfect. I'll come back here and

                        pick you up.

               She starts to walk off.

                                   TIFFANY (CONT'D)

                         Oh, and Robbie...call your mom and tell

                         her you're spending the night at Alex's

                         or something. It's going to be a very

                         special night.

                                      ROBBIE

                                (hypnotised)

                         K...

               She walks away. ROBBIE stands there a moment before waking

               up and leaving also.

     66        INT. EVENING - AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK SHACK                      66

               It is dark. We see ALEX and AOKEE cleaning up from the day's

               food service. ALEX Is wiping down the smoothie area, AOKEE

               is sweeping on the other side of the counter.

                                   ALEX

                             (voice somewhat hushed)

                         I'm telling you we need to talk him.

                         Something's going on.

                                   AOKEE

                             (shaking his head no)

                         Robbie know the right thing to do.     He's

                         a good boy.

                                  ALEX

                        So how about this? He tells me I've got

                        to cover for him if his mother calls. He

                        told her he's spending the night at my

                        house.

                                  AOKEE

                        He say that?

                                   ALEX

                         Yes. Tiffany's got something up her

                         sleeve and Robbie's too messed up to

    Page 69 of 81

                         notice.

                                  AOKEE

                            (reflective)

                        Spending the night at your house.      This

                        very bad. Very bad.

                                  AOKEE (CONT'D)

                        He should be done with the dishes by now.

                        Tell him we want to talk.

               ALEX disappears back into the kitchen. AOKEE goes to an

               empty table under the one light on in the dining area and

               sits down.

               ALEX comes back and ROBBIE follows.

                                   ROBBIE

                         Hey. I'm done with the pots and pans.

                         It's almost nine. Can I take off now?

                                   AOKEE

                         Robbie, please, sit.

               ROBBIE sits down.   So does ALEX.   Robbie looks at both and

               gets suspicious.

                                   ROBBIE

                         Everything OK?

                                   AOKEE

                         That's what we gonna ask you.    What you

                         plan tonight?

                                   ROBBIE

                         Well, Tiffany invited me to a little

                         party up in the mountains.

                                   AOKEE

                         Robbie, you athlete. Big day tomorrow.

                         You need sleep, not party.

                                   ROBBIE

                         It's no big deal.   I'll be fine.

                                  AOKEE

                        Is big deal. Robbie. You good boy,

                        smart, everybody like you, but....

                                    ROBBIE

                         But...

                                   AOKEE

                         Face it. Only one reason Tiffany

                         interested in you. She want to make you

                         so tired and so crazy you lose tomorrow.

                                   ROBBIE

                             (disbelief)

                         Aw, come on...

    Page 70 of 81

                                  ALEX

                        Robbie. She's still going out with

                        Cowboy. I saw them together at the

                        movies two nights ago.

                                  ROBBIE

                        Maybe she's just letting him down easy.

                                  ALEX

                        Robbie...things...things are not always

                        what they seem to be.

                                     ROBBIE

                        Like what?

                                   AOKEE

                         In this case, she acts like she likes you

                         when really she wants Cowboy to win.

                                 ROBBIE

                        Naw. You guys are nuts.      She's not like

                        that.

                                   ALEX

                         She is like that.

                                  ROBBIE

                        Look, I know what to believe and what not

                        to. I'm not that easily fooled.

                                     ALEX

                        Aokee?

                                  AOKEE

                            (shaking his head)

                        Go ahead. Tell him. I trust him.

                                  ALEX

                        OK. Take Aokee for instance.      Gentle,

                        genial Hawaiian guy, right?

                                  ROBBIE

                        Sure. He's great. I love working here.

                        Aokee, you've been real good to me...

                                  ALEX

                        Then let me introduce you properly.

                        Robbie Zirpollo, meet Manuel Ramirez.

               AOKEE'S head is down in his hands. Robbie looks stunned.

                                  ALEX (CONT'D)

                        Manuel's family snuck across the border

                        ten years ago through Juarez, Mexico.

                         who ran our town. They tried to kill

                         him.     We barely got out with our lives.

                                      ROBBIE

                         Aokee?

                                   AOKEE

                             (accent now Mexican)

                         A name I picked up reading an obituary in

                         the paper. I sent away to Hawaii and got

                         his birth records and social security

                         number. This way, I never have to worry

                         about immigration. I spent weeks

                         watching tapes of Hawaii Five-O just to

                         get the accent right. "Book 'em Danno".

                         Huh. What's that all about?

                                   ROBBIE

                             (to Alex)

                         And you knew?

               ALEX nods yes.

                                   AOKEE

                         I burnt my hand on the grill one day and

                         started swearing in Spanish...

                                   ALEX

                             (interrupting)

                         And I said, boy, you speak Spanish like a

                         native....uh oh. It's been our little

                         secret. Now it's your secret, too.

                                   ROBBIE

                             (looking at his watch)

                         I need to think about all this.

                                   ALEX

                             (nodding)

                         You do.

                                   AOKEE

                         Sleep tonight. Sleep well.

                                   ROBBIE

                             (gets up, dazed)

                         Right. Goodnight.

               ROBBIE leaves.     ALEX and AOKEE just sit, looking at each

               other.

     67        EXT. EARLY MORNING. - THUNDER BAY                              67

               Hundreds of people are gathering on bleachers to watch the

               surfing competition.

               A large highway construction type signboard has been erected

               and says "Grounds   93", "Concessions 93" and "Lifeguards

               94".

               It is almost a festival atmosphere.     The JUDGES are standing

      Page 72 of 81

               in a group, conferring, near a table that has the controls

               for the sign. The sign can be viewed easily from the

               bleachers.

               WE look over to the front of AOKEE's and see AOKEE and ALEX

               standing outside the restaurant.

     68        EXT. EARLY MORNING. - MOMENTS LATER - AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK 68

               SHACK

                                   AOKEE

                             (to Alex)

                         Have you seen him?

                                      ALEX

                         Not yet.

               They are looking to the north towards the crowd, but ROBBIE

               appears behind them.

                                   ROBBIE

                             (looking in the same direction)

                         What you lookin' at?

                                  AOKEE

                        We looking for you.        How you sleep?

                                   ROBBIE

                         I slept fine.

                             (pause as AOKEE and ALEX wait)

                         I decided I'm not my father. I don't run

                         out on the people I care about just

                         because some blond shakes her ta-ta's at

                         me.

                                   AOKEE

                             (relieved)

                         We go then.

               ROBBIE picks up his board, and they begin walking toward the

               bleachers. ALEX stops and turns suddenly.

                                   ALEX

                         She shook her ta-tas? No one said

                         anything about shaking ta-tas.

                             (reflectively)

                         This puts a whole new light on things!

               He is in ROBBIE's way.        ROBBIE pushes him with his board.

                                      ROBBIE

                         Get going!

     69        EXT. EARLY MORNING - THUNDER BAY                                  69

               ROBBIE, COWBOY and MELINDA from grounds, who we met earlier

               and was conned into the contest because she said she surfed

               once on vacation, are all standing in front of the JUDGES.

               One JUDGE explains the rules.

    Page 73 of 81

                                   HEAD JUDGE

                             (looking down at clipboard)

                         Alright, here's the deal. You get three

                         tries; three heats. We judge each run

                         and only your high score counts. If you

                         fall you get no score for the run. Your

                         score will be added to the total for your

                         team, and the winner gets the Surfer King

                         Trophy. Any questions?

               They all shake their head no.

                                  HEAD JUDGE (CONT'D)

                        Then let's begin. Grounds is up first.

               MELINDA grabs her board and begins paddling out. The wave

               comes and it's all she can do to stay on her board. She

               struggles and falls at the end. She will clearly not be a

               factor. The big screen shows a 0 in a column after the

               grounds score.

               We look back to the bleachers to polite applause, but the

               COLONEL and the grounds kids are clearly disappointed.

               COWBOY is out there now, the wave comes and he catches it

               easily. He rides the wave gracefully and well, and kicks out

               at the end. The big screen shows an 8 in the lifeguard row.

               The lifeguards and RICHARD are cheering now.

               ROBBIE is next. He catches the wave and rides it more

               aggressively than COWBOY, but nearly falls at the end of his

               run. The big screen shows an 8. The concessions kids and

               AOKEE are very enthusiastic. They can see they have a chance

               with ROBBIE. PIPEMAN is watching from a far corner.

               MELINDA begins her second run. She is a little more

               confident this time, but still seems barely able to stand and

               ride the wave. More polite applause, and the big screen

               shows a 5.

               COWBOY catches his wave, and tries to imitate ROBBIE'S more

               aggressive style, but falls midway through the run. We hear

               a large gasp from the crowd as this happens.

               The crowd applauds politely, and the guards are supportive

               but disappointed. We see the JUDGES confer and the big screen

               shows a 0.

               ROBBIE gets his wave, and surfs it aggressively again, this

               time not nearly falling at all. The JUDGES nod approvingly

               and confer. The big screen shows a 9. The crowd goes wild,

               especially the concessions kids.

               Melinda begins her final run. She does better than the past

               two, but not significantly. The JUDGES confer and the screen

               shows a 5. The ground kids are very disappointed, they know

               they are out of it now. THE COLONEL shakes MELINDA'S hand

               and thanks her for her efforts.

    Page 74 of 81

               COWBOY gets his wave, and has clearly decided to go back to

               his original style; he rides the wave gracefully, but takes

               no chances.

               He kicks out at the end with a wave and a smile. The guards

               applaud, hoping to make it seem better than it was, and the

               JUDGES confer and the screen shows an 8.

               ROBBIE snags his wave and rides it aggressively again, but

               loses his balance momentarily. It costs him; the JUDGES

               confer and the screen shows a 7.

               The concessions kids applaud, and the point totals show

               "Grounds   98", "Concessions 102" and "Lifeguards 102".

               EVERYONE is confused, there has never been a tie before. THE

               JUDGES Are flipping through papers, and BIG MIKE steps up to

               the microphone.

                                  BIG MIKE

                            (clearing his throat,

                             flustered)

                        It looks like we have a tie. This has

                        never happened before, but I seem to

                        remember we provided for this possibility

                        in the rules. Hopefully our judges can

                        help us figure out what to do!

               The HEAD JUDGE is reading to the other JUDGES out loud, slaps

               his hand on one of the papers and comes up to the mike.

                                  HEAD JUDGE

                        Reading from the rules, "...in the event

                        of a tie at the end of three heats in the

                        surf competition, the teams who are tied

                        will participate in a sudden-death surf

                        off. Additional heats will be run until

                        a winner can be declared."

                            (looking up at the crowd)

                        The "Sudden Death" heat will begin in

                        five minutes.

               Everybody cheers...they're going to see some more great

               surfing.

               The JUDGES signal COWBOY and ROBBIE to come over. The head

               JUDGE takes a quarter out of his pocket and points to COWBOY

               to call it. It lands and the JUDGE looks at it. HE points

               to ROBBIE.

                                   HEAD JUDGE (CONT'D)

                         You want to go first or second?

                                   ROBBIE

                         Second.

                                  HEAD JUDGE

                        Be ready in five minutes.

     70        EXT -MOMENTS LATER - AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK SHACK                70

    Page 75 of 81

               ROBBIE, ALEX, AOKEE and PIPEMAN have gathered in front of

               AOKEE's to strategize.

                                   AOKEE

                         So what you do?   Wait for him to go crazy

                         and fall?

                                   ROBBIE

                         Don't want to win with him falling.

                                   PIPEMAN

                         You could always go out and do your very

                         best, take a lot of chances and maybe win

                         this thing on merit.

                                   ALEX

                             (dismissive)

                         Don't be silly. That only works in the

                         movies.

                                   ROBBIE

                             (shakes his head)

                         Actually, that's exactly what I'm

                         thinking. It's the reason we're in a

                         tie. I've been too conservative. I've

                         got to do everything I can, or just

                         forget about it. It's all or nothing.

                             (pause)

                         We gotta pull the fin.

                                   AOKEE

                         Pull da fin?

                                   PIPEMAN

                         You think you can hold it?

                                  ROBBIE

                            (explaining)

                        One time, these tourists from Japan on

                        the beach at La Jolla offered me a

                        hundred bucks to do a full spin at the

                        top of the wave, and then slide down and

                        cut back and do a full back flip. I

                        pulled it off. A friend of mine had a

                        tricks board with just a single fin and

                        foot pockets.

                                   PIPEMAN

                         We gotta pull the fin. What do we do

                         about the foot pockets?

                                   ROBBIE

                         You got duct tape?

               PIPEMAN reaches into his tool belt and pulls out a roll.

                                  PIPEMAN

                        What kind of plumber would I be if I

                        didn't have duct tape? Water World

    Page 76 of 81

                         Platinum!   Where do you want them?

               They place the board on a table. ROBBIE pulls off two small

               pieces of tape and places them on the board.

                                   ROBBIE

                         Here and here.

               PIPEMAN gets his screw gun out of his tool belt and begins

               removing the two outer fins of the board. He then begins

               looping duct tap around the board to create two foot pockets.

               This provides a background to the dialog below.

                                   AOKEE

                         So, help me understand.      What you do now?

                                   ROBBIE

                         Pipeman is taking the extra fins off my

                         board. I only need one to make a deep

                         cut back. He is also putting some

                         pockets to slip my feet into so when I

                         flip upside down, I don't lose the board.

                                   ALEX

                         Flip upside down?

                                   ROBBIE

                         A back flip. You guys see it on

                         snowboarders here all the time, I'm sure.

                                   ALEX

                         Oh yeah, I'm sure I did that last winter.

                         But not on purpose! Dude. You're either

                         gonna win this thing or you're gonna die.

                                   AOKEE

                             (quickly, eagerly)

                         It would be better if you won.

                                   ROBBIE

                         Yeah, well, a tie is like kissing your

                         sister.

                                   ALEX

                             (mock anger)

                         You stay away from my sister.

               We hear an air horn blast.      They are ready to start.

                                     PIPEMAN

                         Ready!

                                   ROBBIE

                             (to PIPEMAN)

                         I'll need the biggest wave you can give

                         me...

                                   PIPEMAN

                             (imitating Mr. Scott on Star

     Page 77 of 81

                              Trek)

                         I'll give 'er all she's got, Cap'n!

               He hands Robbie the board. ALEX heads back to the bleachers

               area, PIPEMAN goes to the pumphouse in back of Thunder Bay.

               AOKEE hangs back with ROBBIE and speaks to him alone.

                                   AOKEE

                             (dropping his Hawaiian accent)

                         Robbie. When you do this, do this mostly

                         for Robbie Zirpollo. But do it just a

                         little bit for Manny Ramirez, eh?

               AOKEE smiles and pats him on the back.    Robbie nods.    They

               head for the bay.

     71        EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - THUNDER BAY                       71

               COWBOY is in the water paddling out to get his wave. It

               comes and he has apparently decided to stay with what has

               gotten him this far; a conservative style that keeps him

               looking good without falling. His ride is similar to the

               last one, but even more graceful and lyrical and he gets a 9.

                                   ALEX

                             (to ROBBIE)

                         Looks like he's waiting for you to make a

                         mistake. You sure you know what you're

                         doing?

                                   ROBBIE

                         I'm just making this up as I go along.

                                   ALEX

                         Works for me! Go get 'em.

               ROBBIE appears on the seawall holding his board and looking

               out first at the bay, then at the crowd. His mom, CONNIE

               waves, and he smiles weakly.

               HE sees KATIE and she looks hopeful. She hasn't given up on

               him completely. He smiles at her and gets into the water.

               He begins paddling. It seems to take forever for him to get

               out to the spot where he catches the wave, but he finally

               arrives.

               He sits there for a moment, collecting himself, then raises

               his hand to signal he is ready.

               The CONCESSIONS KIDS have started to chant, ROBBIE! ROBBIE!

               The guards are anxious, but even they can't help moving to

               the cadence of the chant.

               The wave comes and he catches it quickly, and slips his feet

               into the duct tape pockets. He misses one pocket at first,

               then gets it in.

               He rides it carefully and at the right moment slides up to

      Page 78 of 81

               the top and executes a full 360 degree turn out of the water.

               On landing back on the downside of the wave, he slides down

               it quickly, and then turns around with a deep cut and heads

               straight into the wave. At the top he bounces and does a

               complete back flip in slow motion.

               We see the crowd also in slow motion. AOKEE Is covering his

               eyes, he can't watch. ALEX's face is contorted with

               disbelief. Various faces in the crowd are in open-mouthed

               disbelief. THE JUDGES are staring intently, focussed so as

               not to miss anything.

               ROBBIE lands the flip, and rides the rest of the wave.      He

               waves to the crowd, and kicks off, exhausted.

               The place goes nuts. No one here has ever seen anything like

               this before. AOKEE and ALEX run into the water and help him

               out. People are still cheering.

               COWBOY knows he's in trouble.

               THE JUDGES confer only momentarily and the score 10 appears,

               and the word concessions starts flashing along with the word

               winner. COWBOY nods in agreement.

               TIFFANY says something to him, and he appears angry.      We can

               only hear part of his response, something like:

                                   COWBOY

                             (disbelief)

                         You did WHAT?

               AOKEE and ALEX lead him up to the grandstand. COWBOY also

               makes his way up there, and we see him talking to BIG MIKE.

               BIG MIKE nods in agreement and COWBOY goes to the mike as the

               crowd settles down.

                                   COWBOY (CONT'D)

                         As last year's Surfer King, it's my

                         privilege to present this year's trophy

                         to the most amazing surfer on the water

                         today. Robbie! Congratulations.

               COWBOY shakes ROBBIE's hand, and ROBBIE speaks at the mike.

                                   ROBBIE

                             (holding trophy)

                         I just want to thank Aokee, Alex and

                         Katie for all their support.

               We see KATIE clapping, crying.   AOKEE and ALEX are clapping

               and smiling.

                                   ROBBIE (CONT'D)

                         And I have just one thing to say to

                         everyone in concessions. WE DID IT!

               ROBBIE holds the trophy high as everyone cheers.

     72        EXT. EARLY EVENING SURFS WAVE POOL                              72

               Grounds kids are stacking chairs in preparation for final

               closing. Tarps are being thrown over everything and tied

               down.

               Awnings are being taken down.     Chairs and tables are being

               moved.

               We see JAFFA packing up his CD's into that cardboard box.       HE

               also snaps the winter covers for the sound equipment into

               place.

     73        EXT. MOMENTS LATER - EVENING TIME OUT SHACK                     73

               A banner hangs over the time shack, "Thanks for another great

               year". ALEX, ROBBIE, KATIE and AMY are clocking out for the

               final time this summer.

               They all stop and look around one final time.     Suddenly

               TIFFANY drives up in her convertible.

                                   TIFFANY

                         Another summer gone. How about it

                         Robbie? You gonna guard next year?      They

                         could use your help.

               They all walk closer to her car.

                                   ROBBIE

                         I don't know...we have a pretty good time

                         at AOKEE's.

                                   TIFFANY

                         You know, that's what I hear. Maybe I

                         should work there next summer.

               ALEX, ROBBIE, KATIE and AMY all say these lines pretty much

               at the same time.

                                   ROBBIE

                         You wouldn't like it...

                                   ALEX

                         That's a bad idea...

                                   KATIE

                         And you're such a good guard...

                                   AMY

                         You'd be miserable...

                                   TIFFANY

                         Maybe you're right.    See you around...

               EDDIE appears out of the time shack wearing his tuxedo t

               shirt.

    Page 80 of 81

                                   EDDIE

                             (almost singing)

                         Tiffany!

               He walks up to her driver's side.

                                   TIFFANY

                             (feeling charitable, warmly)

                         Hello, Eddie.

               EDDIE shows there is nothing in his hands, then reaches into

               the car and from behind TIFFANY's ear pulls a plastic Easter

               Egg out. He hands it to her, and she opens it. A beautiful

               butterfly flies out and away. She is momentarily entranced.

                                    TIFFANY (CONT'D)

                         You know, that's one of the most

                         beautiful things I've ever seen.

                             (pause, thinking, what the

                              heck)

                         Hop in Eddie, let me give you a ride

                         home.

               EDDIE waves his hand for HER to scoot over so he can drive.

               She is surprised, but does, almost reflexively. He gets in

               and he looks at ALEX, ROBBIE, KATIE and AMY grinning broadly

               as he pulls away.

               ALEX, ROBBIE, KATIE and AMY just watch in stunned silence as

               EDDIE and TIFFANY drive off.

                                   ALEX

                             (collecting himself)

                         Well. Just another summer at Water

                         World.

               The group begins walking toward the exit gate, as we go wide

               and helicopter upward. They get smaller and smaller in the

               shot as we hear the conversation continue.

                                   ROBBIE

                         You know Katie, I really am sorry I was

                         such a jerk this summer.

                                  KATIE

                        We'll be going to the same high school.

                        You'll have plenty of chances to make it

                        up to me. Let's see, there's Homecoming,

                        the Christmas Dance, Valentines Day...and

                        of course, the prom...

                                   ROBBIE

                         Alex?

                                   ALEX

                         Yeah?

                                   ROBBIE

                         I'm gonna need to borrow twenty bucks.

                                     ALEX

                         Yep.

               We helicopter up for a final shot over the whole park.

                                    THE END
