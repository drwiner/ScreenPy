          EXT. AKRON'S CANAL PARK - DAY

          RICK STEVENS, thirty-six, is Middle America personified. He

          blends in at the crowded ballpark. Blue jeans, work boots, a

          ball cap and leather jacket complete his attire. He snacks on

          a bag of popcorn. The CRACK of the bat and the CROWD is on

          their feet. A BALL PLAYER slides safely into second with a

          double. JOHN SILVERSTEIN, thirty-three, business clad, talks

          on his cell phone. Calm and collected he appears unaffected

          by the cheering crowd. The sits with the crowd.

                              RICK

                    Helluva talent, that kid.

          John flashes a quick grin, never missing a beat in his phone

          call.

                              RICK

                    Probably be in the bigs in another

                    year.

          John nods, smiles and turns away from Rick to continue

          uninterrupted.

          MELANIE SIMMERS, twenty-four, scurries around a sparse, but

          neatly adorned house getting dressed.

                              MELANIE

                    Zach? Are you ready? Mommy, can't

                    be late again.

          Melanie ENTERS.

                              MELANIE

                    Come on baby. Don't do this to

                    mommy. Not today.

                    dresses her son.

                    Zach, do you want mommy to get

                    fired?

                                ZACH

                    Yes.

                              MELANIE

                    If I get fired we won't have the

          John still talks on his cell.

                              RICK

                    Must be something to have that kind

                    of talent. He's just a kid,

                    nineteen, twenty tops, and if he

                    stays healthy and he stays focused,

                    the world is his oyster. Guys like

                    you and me, we squandered those

                    opportunities long ago.

          John ends his call and turns back to Rick.

                                JOHN

                    You.

                                RICK

                    Huh?

                              JOHN

                    Guys like you...

                                RICK

                    And me...

                              JOHN

                    ... squandered opportunities. I, on

                    the other hand, knew where I was

                    going. I had that kind of drive, I

                    just never had the talent.

                              RICK

                    You knew where you were going?

                                                                  3.

                    Absolutely.

                    At nineteen?

                              JOHN

                    Without question.

                              RICK

                    The only thing I knew for certain

                    was that I would run to the corner

                    store every day for beer.

                              ZACH

                    I'm not thirteen. It's against the

                    law to leave me alone in a car

                    until I'm thirteen.

          John's phone RINGS. He ignores the call.

                    I had priorities. I understood what

                    it meant to have an attention span.

                                                                   4.

                    You could focus?

                    I was the King of Focus.

          Rick ducks. John appears perplexed. John's POV: A foul ball

          is screaming in his direction. Too late: The ball strikes

          John in the face knocking him out of his seat. Rick recovers

          and continues to snack on his popcorn.

                              RICK

                    Family, my man. Take time off for a

                    ballgame ya should probably tend to

                    the family too. You should try it

                    sometime.

                              JOHN

                    In the grand scheme of things

                    family is a liability, not an

                    asset. Rick continues on.

                              JOHN

                        (Calling out.)

                    Do you even know what you're doing

                    or where you're going?

                               RICK

                        (Yelling over his

                          shoulder.)

                    East.

                              JOHN

                    East leads nowhere, my friend. You

                    should be heading south. The bar is

                    south. East takes you places you

                    don't want to go.

                                                                     9.

          Rick reaches the corner and darts across the street.

          Rick appears dumbfounded as the officers exit the cruiser

          with guns drawn. Officer One remains stationary. Officer Two

          circles behind Rick.

                              OFFICER ONE

                    Get em up. Up I said... up.

          Placing his pistol back in his holster Officer Two grabs Rick

          by the collar and throws him against the cruiser. Officer One

          remains drawn on Rick. His hands shake with nervous

          anticipation.

                    You have the right to shut the hell

                    If you don't shut the hell up my

                    partner might exercise his right to

                    shoot you. Do you understand?

          `Yes' begins to form on Rick's lips. A quick glance at

          Officer One and he decides to nod.

                    Nothing pisses me off more than

                    twitching and talking. If he

                              LADY IN BLACK

                    Could you have him step forward?

          The Detective keys his microphone again.

                              DETECTIVE JOHNSON

                    Number three take two steps

                    forward.

          Rick steps forward and the lights dim on the other four.

          Caught in the spotlight, Rick squints from the brightness.

          The lady in black shifts in her seat. A long beat.

                                                                    16.

                              LADY IN BLACK

                    That's him.

                              DETECTIVE JOHNSON

                    You're positive?

                              LADY IN BLACK

                    I'm positive. That's the man that

                    needs to be in custody.

          The detective keys his microphone once again.

                              DETECTIVE JOHNSON

                    Okay number three step back. Rick

                    does as he's told.

                              DETECTIVE JOHNSON

                    Turn to your right --- all of

                    you...

          The group follows the detective's instruction.

                              DETECTIVE JOHNSON

                    ...and exit.

          One by one the men filter through the door. Rick EXITS.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. THEATER - CONTINUOUS

          Rick ENTERS on stage. The entire theater is cast in shades of

          gray. The stage is barren. There is no audience. He looks

          around for a moment and as he reaches center stage is once

          again flooded with the spotlight. Rick uses his arm to shade

          his eyes. SFX: A SOFT DIN OF VOICES. Looking stage left Rick

          realizes TWELVE JURORS have appeared in their box. A small

          AUDIENCE has congregated. SFX: THE DIN SWELLS TO A QUIET

          CHAOS. A RAPPING of a gavel and Rick's attention swings to a

          white haired JUDGE (70's).

                              JUDGE

                    Order in the court.

          The noise level wanes, but not completely. Another RAP of the

          gavel.

                              JUDGE

                    Order in the court, I say.

          Focused on the Judge, Rick doesn't notice THE PROSECUTOR

          approaching from stage right.

                                                                   17.

          Carrying a folding chair in one hand, notes and manila

          folders in the other, he sets the chair behind Rick.

                              PROSECUTOR

                    Have a seat.

                              JUDGE

                    Do you know why you're here today,

                    Mr. Stevens?

                              RICK

                    Why am I here?

                              JUDGE

                    Are you being rhetorical?

                              RICK

                    Are you asking me?

                              JUDGE

                    You stand here today an accused

                    man.

                              RICK

                    Accused? Accused of what?

                              JUDGE

                    You have been placed in custody of

                    your children.

                                 RICK

                    Huh?

                              PROSECUTOR

                    Your children, Mr. Stevens. You do

                    realize you have children, don't

                    you?

                              RICK

                    Yes, but...

                              PROSECUTOR

                    But nothing Mr. Stevens, either you

                    have children or you don't.

                                 RICK

                    I do.

                              PROSECUTOR

                    So, you accept responsibility for

                    bringing young life into the world?

                                 RICK

                    I guess...

                                               18.

                    PROSECUTOR

          There's no guessing, Mr. Stevens,

          either you're responsible for

          siring offspring or you aren't.

                    RICK

          I am, but I'm not sure it was

          responsible.

                    PROSECUTOR

          A crime of passion, Mr. Stevens?

          How convenient.

              (A beat)

          And you accept the consequences of

          said actions?

                    RICK

          Why am I here?

                    PROSECUTOR

          Why are you here, Mr. Stevens? Why

          are you here? I'll tell you why

          you're here. Are you familiar with

          Ms. Cynthia Stevens?

                    RICK

          Yeah, she's my wife.

                    PROSECUTOR

          Was your wife, Sir. Was your wife.

          She recently filed for divorce.

          Were you aware of that?

                    RICK

          No, no I wasn't.

                    PROSECUTOR

          Well, she did. She also named you

          as her coconspirator in the act of

          having children. Were you aware of

          that, Mr. Stevens?

                       RICK

          Again, no.

                    PROSECUTOR

          Mr. Stevens, you just told the

          court that you aware you had

          children. You have also admitted

          that Ms. Cynthia Stevens was, in

          fact, your wife.

                    (MOR E)

                                                                    19.

                              PRO SECUT OR (cont'd)

                    On top of that you told this court

                    that you accepted the

                    responsibility of having said

                    children, did you not?

                              RICK

                    Yes, but...

                              PROSECUTOR

                    Then why, Mr. Stevens, do you

                    continue to deny culpability in

                    this situation?

          Rick realizes the audience has swelled to nearly a full

          house. Beads of sweat form on his brow.

                              JUDGE

                    Answer the question.

                              AUDIENCE

                    Answer the question.

          Like a trapped animal, Rick looks for his escape.

                              PROSECUTOR

                    The question, Mr. Stevens.

                              RICK

                    How can you be sure it was me?

          The audience hisses. The Judge RAPS his gavel.

                              PROSECUTOR

                    She picked you out of a lineup,

                    Sir. What more do you need?

                              RICK

                    Time.

                              PROSECUTOR

                    Time is not an option, Mr. Stevens.

                    Time --- is not --- an option.

          A look of sad resignation crosses Rick's face.

                              PROSECUTOR

                    You don't deny being married to Ms.

                    Stevens, nor do you deny the act of

                    procreation. You seem to understand

                    that your actions bear consequence.

                    You seem to understand that with

                    parenthood, came responsibility.

                              (MOR E)

                                                                  20.

                              PRO SECUT OR (cont'd)

                    It seems to me, as it should to

                    anyone with the capacity for simple

                    deduction that you, Mr. Stevens,

                    did willingly and knowingly enter

                    into the commitments of parenthood

                    fully aware of the potential

                    pratfalls. Did you not?

                              RICK

                    Yes, yes I did.

                              PROSECUTOR

                    It's time to pay the piper, Mr.

                    Stevens.

                        (To the Judge)

                    It is the recommendation of the

                    State that Richard C. Stevens been

                    sentenced to the fullest capacity

                    allowed by law.

                              RICK

                    What about Cindy?

                                 PROSECUTOR

                    Excuse me?

                              RICK

                    My ex, Cindy, what about her

                    responsibilities to the children?

          The Prosecutor moves to Rick and whispers in his ear.

                              PROSECUTOR

                    She cut a deal, Rick. You were the

                    one we wanted. You were the one we

                    got. She took the plea. Sure, it

                    costs her financially. But what is

                    freedom worth?

          A CLAMOR begins to rise from the crowd as they talk among

          themselves. The RAP of the gavel.

                              JUDGE

                    I see no reason to extend this any

                    further. Mr. Stevens you have been

                    found competent by the State and by

                    this Court. You are completely

                    cognizant of your surroundings, and

                    you leave me no choice. This court

                    finds you guilty as charged.

                              RICK

                    Guilty of what?

                                                                 21.

                              JUDGE

                    You are hereby remanded to custody

                    of your children for no less than a

                    lifetime. This Court is adjourned.

          A GASP in the audience mixed with CHEERS. Rick appears

          dumbfounded. A BAILIFF approaches Rick and begins to lead him

          off stage. Rick scuffles and struggles. The Judge stands and

          begins to collect his files.

                              RICK

                    I can't do this alone. Don't make

                    me do this alone. I'll never make

                    it...

                              JUDGE

                    If you can't do the time, Mr.

                    Stevens, then don't do the crime.

          Rick sits alone, his head hung low. A JAILER, (40's)

          approaches leading THREE YOUNG CHILDREN to the cell. KRIS,

          (8), is followed by PHILLIP, (6), and NICHOLAS, (4). The door

          swings open. The children run to their father.

                              KRIS

                    Daddy!

                                              22.

          Hi guys.

                    PHILLIP

          I love you daddy.

                    RICK

          I love you too, Phillip.

                    NICHOLAS

          I love you more.

                    RICK

          I love you more.

                    NICHOLAS

          I love YOU more.

                    KRIS

          Daddy, how come you're in jail?

                    PHILLIP

          Is this where we live?

                    KRIS

          When can we see mommy?

          Come here guys. I want to talk to

          you. The boys gather round.

                    PHILLIP

          What's wrong Daddy?

                    RICK

          I don't know when we're going to

          see your mom again.

                    KRIS

          Is she okay?

                    RICK

          She's kind of mad at daddy.

                    NICHOLAS

          Mommy mad at me too?

                    RICK

          No, baby, not at all. Your mom

          needs time to work through some

          things. So, for awhile, it's just

          going to be us...

                                                                 23.

                              KRIS

                    What's she need time for?

                              RICK

                    She misses you too, baby. And this

                    isn't permanent... we're going to

                    fight this... we're going to

                    appeal. We'll take it to the

                    I've seen your kind before. You're

                    a lifer. Whether it's fair or not.

                    Whether justice was served. It

                    doesn't matter. You're here for the

          Nicky shakes his head again no again.

                    Daddy will buy Nicky a toy from the

                    store.

                    Okay.

                              RICK

                    If Nicky goes potty on the potty.

          Nicky shakes his head no and begins to cry.

                    Thank God.

                    Well, I need to give him a local so

                    that I can sew the laceration, but

                    he's not cooperating. Maybe hold

                    his hand and distract him?

          Rick moves to Phillip.

                    Hi little buddy.

                    nothing works. I was wondering if

                    our kids could play together. Maybe

                    never abandons his children.

                    You have a kid.

                                 MELANIE

                    So do you.

                              RICK

                    Not criticizing, just surprised. I

                    don't believe anyone at their old

                    day-care had kids. If they did they

                    kept them in a closet and only

                    brought them out on special

                    occasions. Christmas, Easter, an

                    occasional birthday, and maybe when

                    they had friends over for dinner,

                    but only as a status symbol. It was

                    like they'd say, "Here's the white

                    picket fence. Here's the SUV.

                    Here's the dog. Oh yes, here's the

                    2.5 children. Kids you can get back

                    in the closet now."

                                                                 46.

                              MELANIE

                    You'd could make a fortune with a

                    Renta- Kid business.

                              RICK

                    That has potential.

                              MELANIE

                    I've often thought of renting mine.

                    Why pay for a baby-sitter when

                    thousands of people would pay good

                    money to set your kid on the mantle

                    for a few hours?

                              RICK

                    So, what's his name?

                                ZACH

                    I'm Zach.

          Rick drops to a knee and extends his hand.

                              RICK

                    Hello Zach. I'm Rick.

                              ZACH

                    You're old.

                              RICK

                    You got me there. I am old.

                                ZACH

                    How old?

                              RICK

                    Older than dirt. When I was a kid

                    we didn't have dirt. We had rocks

                    and we had hammers. If we wanted

                    dirt we banged a few rocks with

                    really big hammers, and then we had

                    dirt.

                              MELANIE

                    Worked the chain gangs?

                              ZACH

                    and the little guy from the potty,

                    is Nicholas. Guys, this is Zach

                    Ever try Cheerios?

                              RICK

                    Huh?

                              MELANIE

                    For potty training. Give him

                    something to aim at. Drop a Cheerio

                    or two in the toilet and let him

                    pee away.

                              RICK

                    I'll have to try that. So, any

                    questions about the job? Melanie

                    moves towards the boys.

                              MELANIE

                    I'm going to go talk to them for a

                    little bit. I'll let you know.

          Melanie crouches to the boy's level. They appear to take a

          real shine to her. Nicholas hands her a book, and the four of

          them move to the cell cot. The boys gather round.

                              ZACH

                    My mom tells great stories.

                              KRIS

                    We don't have a mom.

                              ZACH

                    That's okay, I don't have a dad.

                                                                  48.

          lit room. Rick watches from a doorway.

                              MELANIE

                    Not a knack really. It's just about

                    finding hope in places there should

                    be none.

                              RICK

                    Whatever it is, I've never seen

                    them take to a woman like that.

                    Melanie smiles.

                    I feel bad for the boys. They don't

                    have a "mom". She'll always be

                    their mother, but she'll never be

                    their mom.

                    Quit trying so hard. You're forcing

                    issues that can't be forced. Relax.

                    Everything happens when and how

                    it's suppose to. It's about spirit

                    and finding the will to love again,

                    for you and the boys.

          Against a burning sky, Rick waits in the drive. Cindy

          arrives. Her hair is strewed. The boys pile out of the car

          and gather round their mommy. She kneels to their level.

                    Give your Mom a hug, guys, then get

                    in the house.

          The boys hug their mom and then run to the door. A tear wells

          in Cindy's eye.

                                 CINDY

                    I'm sorry.

                    I could have told you that.

                              CINDY

                    I had to give it a shot. Rick turns

                    to walk away.

          Rick's POV: Sees the boys looking out the door. Rick turns

          back around to Cindy.

                              RICK

                    At whose expense? Huh, Cindy? At

                    whose expense? Who's going to dry

                    Quit dwelling on all of your

                    misgivings. Look around you. You're

                    not alone. But you, and you alone,

                    will make the difference.

          Rick notices his cell door is unlocked. He steps into the

          corridor. Rick's POV: Walking past cells he sees people he

          knows. His mother and father appear very old. Melanie is at

          Mrs. Nelson's house. Zach clings to her leg. Carrie's angry.

          John talks away his phone.

          Rick and the boys wait for their caseworker. A pregnant WOMAN

          and her TWELVE CHILDREN sit a few seats away. Her face and

          clothes are as dirty as her children's. Rick looks at his

          watch, and then at her, and then back to his watch. He slips

          the watch off his wrist and hands it to her.

                                                               76.

                    It's not worth a lot, maybe a few

                    hundred bucks, but it might keep

                    you in soap for a year.

          A CASEWORKER comes to Rick.

                    woman. Look at those poor, poor

                    children. How unfortunate it must

                    be that they only have a mother.

                    How terrible it must be not to know

                    their father.

                       Four. Two on top and two on bottom.

                       He got a quarter for the first one,

                       fifty cents for the next two and he

                       parlayed the last into an even

                       dollar. Nicholas cries at night

                       because he thinks the house is

                       filled with ghosts. Kiss him once

                       on the forehead, once on the cheek

                       and sing The Cradle Will Rock and

                       he'll sleep the whole night

                       through. Kris' favorite subject is

                       math. He loves to read and write,

                       but he doesn't do so well in social

                       studies. He knows how to ride a

                       bike. Why? Because I taught him.

                       Phillip wants to learn but he's

                       always afraid he'll fall. Nicky

                       just likes to Flintstone his

                       tricycle. Phillip's favorite

                       cartoon is Tunenami.

                    I always thought I wanted to be a

                    parent, and I was really good at

                    being pregnant, but I sucked as a

          pamphlet then up to see they aren't even close to the top.

          They have just reached a plateau along the way.

                    We can do it.

                              RICK

                        (Through a weary voice.)

                    Yes we can.

          INT. SMALL SUBURBAN HOME - LIVING ROOM

          Rick wears his painter's pants. The boys are armed with an

          assortment of paintbrushes. Paint cans and ladders adorn the

          room.

          Rick and the boys continue their climb. The breaths are

          heavy, but they march steadily upward.

          Rick stands back and looks at one finished wall. Kris mimics

          his father, backing up to have a look for himself.

                              RICK

                    Kris!

          Too late, Kris has tripped over a can of paint. As he sits on

          his butt a look of fear crosses his face, a tear forms in his

          eye. Rick takes his paintbrush and dots Kris on the nose.

                              KRIS

                    Hey!

          Phillip and Nicholas are quickly engaged in painting each

          other and a full-blown paint war ensues.

          Melanie looks her boyfriend square in the eyes, runs her hand

                                 MELANIE

                    I'm sorry.

          Melanie EXITS the car and runs down the street.

          Rick and the boys stop to rest. Kris throws a rock while Rick

          is looking away. Rick looks up to find Phillip picking up a

          stone.

                              RICK

                    Put the stone down.

                    But...

                              RICK

                    No buts: Put the stone down.

          Off Screen SFX: A huge thud and someone rolling down the

                              RICK

                    I knew this was a hard climb,

                    but...

          A RESTING CLIMBER appears.

                              RESTING CLIMBER

                    Long way up.

                                 RICK

                    Yeah.

                              RESTING CLIMBER

                    Long way down for that matter.

                                 RICK

                    That too.

          A beat.

                              RICK

                    So, what's your point.

                              RESTING CLIMBER

                    No point, just an observation.

                    Drink?

          The climber holds out a canteen.

                                RICK

                    I'm okay.

                              RESTING CLIMBER

                    For the boys.

                              NICHOLAS

                    Daddy, I'm thirsty. Rick studies

                    the climber for a moment.

                                RICK

                    Go ahead.

          The climber hands the boys the canteen.

                              RESTING CLIMBER

                    You know, if you stop here, halfway

                    between a long way up and a long

                    way down you really haven't

                    accomplished much, have you?

                              RICK

                    We're not stopping. We're just

                    resting.

                              RESTING CLIMBER

                    That's what I said, fourteen years

                    ago. Rick looks toward the top.

                              RICK

                    We can do this.

                              RESTING CLIMBER

                    Yes you can.

          A reinvigorated Rick hops to his feet.

                              RICK

                    We can do this!

          INT. THEATER

          Rick is back on the stage. The audience is full.

                              PROSECUTOR

                    What is so important Mr. Stevens

                    that you would burden this court

                    with convening today?

                              RICK

                    I just needed clarification.

                              PROSECUTOR

                    On what, Mr. Stevens? On what?

                              RICK

                    I know if I have to, I can do this

                    alone, but do I have to do this

                    alone? A hushed MURMUR rises in the

                    audience. The Judge RAPS his gavel

                    on the bench.

                              JUDGE

                    Order in this court! A beat as

                    things quiet down.

                              JUDGE (CONT'D)

                    Your inquiry, Mr. Stevens? Is it in

                    the best interest of the children

                    or in the best interest of you?

                              RICK

                    I don't know.

                              PROSECUTOR

                    He doesn't know. He just doesn't

                    know.

                              RICK

                    I don't know.

                              JUDGE

                    Then this court sees no reason to

                    amend the original verdict. The

                    order stands.

                              RICK

                    But...

                              PROSECUTOR

                    Tell it to someone who cares, Mr.

                    Stevens.

                                                                 87.

                              RICK

                    I have. I have laid my heart out on

                    the line time and time again, only

                    to walk away empty handed. This

                    love, this caring, this sharing of

                    life, it's a sentence and my heart

                    has been condemned. It doesn't

                    matter who I've told, what's in my

                    heart is never quite enough. The

                    people I have cared for most have

                    shunned me in life and in love.

                    Unanswered phone calls... Unnoticed

                    displays of affection... A rose

                    that withers on the doorstep... No

                    matter what I do, it's never

                    enough. Just once, just one fucking

                    time, I want to be enough.

                              PROSECUTOR

                    Your only condemnation is self-

                    pity. You have people that care all

                    around you, but you're too blind to

                    see them. If you don't pull

                    yourself together soon, my friend,

                    they soon will all be gone.

          In B&W SLO-MO: Rick stands watching his sons play. The wind

          blows the leaves of a tree. The boys run further and further

          out until they are out of sight. Rick calls out to them.

          Slowly, across the field, three young adults return. Rick is

          now an old man, hunched over and aged with wrinkles. The

          three young men walk beside their elderly father, supporting

          him with each step.

          Rick is holding flowers. The boys have an assortment of

          "instruments" to add a serenade. The music is a mishmash of

          odd notes that could only be construed as music to a parent's

          ear. Melanie stands on the front porch, her arms crossed.

                              MELANIE

                    could ever be the man you need me

                    knocked you down. It wasn't fair.

                    Life's not fair Rick.

                              RICK

                    You were more a mother to my boys

                    than they have ever known. You were

                    more a woman to me than I have ever

                    deserved.

                              MELANIE

                    You're right.

                              MELANIE

                    Cut the bullshit, Rick.

          Rick wraps his arms around Melanie and pulls her in for a

          hug.

                        (In Mel's ear)

                    I can live my life alone. I can

                    raise my kids alone. I can walk

                    this path alone. I'd much rather do

                    it with you.

                                                                 89.

                    I can't.

          She turns to go inside.

                    Can't?

                    I shouldn't have come here.

                    No, you shouldn't have.

          Rick turns to leave.

                    You just don't get it do you?

          Melanie lays in bed covering her ears.

                              MELANIE (VO)

                    Days go by when I lose me. There

                    are nights when I lay in bed and I

                    can hear Zach through the walls.

                    He's crying out for me, and I lay

                    there motionless, wishing I was

                    anyone but me, anywhere but here,

                    thinking that somewhere, sometime,

                    there has to be room for me. But

                    that someday never seems to come.

                    You're dangerous. Loving you means

                    I lose me. And I will never lose

                    let that happen.

                    So, don't come knocking on my door,

                    asking for my heart, if you don't

                    have room for me.

          Melanie ENTERS the house closing the door behind her. Rick

          tosses the flowers on the porch, turns and walks away. The

          boys follow behind.

                              KRIS

                    I could have looked sad.

                              PHILLIP

                    I can look sad too.

                              KRIS

                    But I look sadder.

                              NICHOLAS

                    I sad.

          Nicholas starts to cry.

          EXT. GORGE PARK - DAY

          Rick falls flat on his face. He lays there motionless.

                              PHILLIP

                    Don't quit, daddy.

          Rick pounds the ground, pulls himself up, dusts himself off

          and with a determined look starts back up the hill.

                              KRIS

                    Daddy doesn't quit.

                                                   CUT TO:

          INT. NIGHT CLUB

          Rick and John sit at the bar.

                              JOHN

                    You love her?

                              RICK

                    I think so... I don't know.

                              JOHN

                    If you think you're in love you

                    are.

                                               91.

                    RICK

          I suppose I am.

                    JOHN

          Does your heart skip a beat when

          she walks by?

                    RICK

          She's my best friend... or was.

                    JOHN

          Does your heart skip a beat when

          she walks by?

                       RICK

          Yes.

                     JOHN

          Do your palms sweat when you think

          about her?

                       RICK

          Yes.

                    JOHN

          Does she inspire you?

                    RICK

          With music and poetry.

                    JOHN

          And is there passion?

                    RICK

          There's fire.

                    JOHN

          And have you ever told her this?

                       RICK

          She knows.

                    JOHN

          Have you ever told her this?

                       RICK

          No.

                    JOHN

          Don't you think you should?

                    RICK

          It only confuses things.

                                                                   92.

                              JOHN

                    Loving your best friend confuses

                    things? I can't think of a love

                    more lucid. Rick stands to leave.

                              JOHN

                    You know I'll never forgive you for

                    this, don't you? You had the power

                    and the dream at your fingertips

                    and you're giving it all away.

                              RICK

                    You didn't marry your best friend?

                                JOHN

                    No.

                              RICK

                    I thought you had things all

                    planned out.

                              JOHN

                    Affairs of the heart and those of

                    the mind are two different things.

                              RICK

                    It's not too late, you know?

          With a shrug John drops to one knee in front of Rick.

                              RICK

                    Go Home, John. Go home and talk to

                    your best friend the way you talk

                    to me.

          INT. PARENT'S HOUSE

          Rick BURSTS through the front door. His mother appears

          aghast.

                              RICK

                    I need you to watch the boys.

                              MOTHER

                    But you're father...

          Rick's Father ENTERS.

                              FATHER

                    Woman, enough.

                                MOTHER

                    But...

                                                                 93.

                              FATHER

                    No more excuses. It's time to live

                    life and enjoy our grandkids.

                        (To Rick)

                    Go. The boys will be fine.

                              MOTHER

                    Can't we just give him money to pay

                    for a baby-sitter?

          Rick BOLTS out of the house.

                                                   CUT TO:

          INT. RESTAURANT

          Melanie is working as a waitress. She's pouring coffee when

          she sees Rick.

                              MELANIE

                        (To herself)

                    Oh shit.

                               CUSTOMER

                    Whoa!

          The cup has nearly reached the brim.

                               MELANIE

                    Sorry.

                              CUSTOMER

                    Pay attention, would ya?

          Rick reaches her.

                              MELANIE

                    What do you want?

                               RICK

                    To talk.

                              MELANIE

                    I'm working.

                               RICK

                    I know.

          Melanie is at the next customer who early awaits a refill,

          but she doesn't pour.

                              MELANIE

                    So, where are the boys?

                                                                 94.

                              RICK

                    They're at my parents.

                              MELANIE

                    What? Not going to use them to try

                    to persuade me with guilt?

                              RICK

                    Is that what you thought?

                              MELANIE

                    I have a son of my own. I know when

                    people are using their kids.

                              CUSTOMER 2

                    Ma'am.

                              RICK

                        (To Customer 2)

                    Excuse us for a moment okay?

                              CUSTOMER 2

                    I'd just like some coffee.

          Melanie walks off. Rick grabs a cup from a recently vacated

          table and sets it in front of the patron.

                              CUSTOMER 2

                        (Calling out.)

                    Excuse me, Miss?

                              RICK

                    What is your problem?

                              CUSTOMER 2

                    Cold.

                              RICK

                    What?

                              CUSTOMER 2

                    The coffee, it's cold.

          Rick picks up the cup, pulls a lighter from his pocket and

          runs it several times under the mug.

                              RICK

                        (Setting the cup back

                         down.)

                    Quit your bitching.

          Rick moves to Melanie.

                                                                 95.

                              MELANIE

                    I can't believe you came here.

                              RICK

                    I can't believe you're a waitress.

                              MELANIE

                    Beats chasing around after snot

                    nosed brats all day.

                              RICK

                    I thought you liked my kids.

                              MELANIE

                    I was talking about you.

          Melanie moves on. Rick gives chase. He catches her and spins

          her around spilling coffee all over the floor.

                              RICK

                    I deserved that.

                              MELANIE

                    So, what do the kids need? A

                    babysitter? A surrogate mom?

                              RICK

                    This isn't about the kids.

                              MELANIE

                    Then what's it about?

                              RICK

                    It's about me, the selfish prick.

                                 MELANIE

                    About you?

                              RICK

                    Hear me out, okay?

                              MELANIE

                        (Looking at her watch.)

                    You have 15 seconds.

                              RICK

                    Okay, okay.

                                 MELANIE

                    Ten.

                                                          96.

                              RICK

                    Melanie, there is a grace about you

                    that reminds me how clumsy I am.

                    There is an honesty about you that

                    reminds me how deceitful I can be.

                    There is a beauty in your eyes that

                    reminds me how ugly I've become.

                    There is a kindness in your voice

                    that contradicts my coarseness.

                    There is a glow around you that

                    illuminates my dullness. There is

                    spirit in you that challenges my

                    laziness, but most of all, there is

                    a woman in you, that sparks my

                    desire, a desire to be graceful and

                    honest and beautiful and kind. A

                    desire to be better than I am or

                    ever thought I could be.

                              MELANIE

                    Go on.

                              RICK

                    I think my ten seconds are up.

                              MELANIE

                    Who's counting?

                              CUSTOMER 2

                    Miss... My coffee?

          Melanie sets the coffee on a nearby table.

                              MELANIE

                    Get it yourself.

                              RICK

                    I love you.

                              MELANIE

                    I don't think I heard you.

                              RICK

                    If I give you my heart will you

                    promise to treat it softly? Kiss it

                    when it hurts? Put it in a box and

                    know that it belongs to you?

                              MELANIE

                    That's not what you said.

                              RICK

                    I said I love you.

                                                                 97.

                              MELANIE

                    As brutal as that can be?

                              RICK

                    I love you. I love you, I love you,

                    I love you.

                              MELANIE

                    I kind of like you too.

          Rick comes to another plateau and finds Melanie waiting for

          him.

                              MELANIE

                    I never thought you'd make it.

                              RICK

                    Been waiting long?

                              MELANIE

                    I never thought you'd find me.

                              RICK

                    I had to find me first. I hope you

                    plan on walking, cause I'm not sure

                    I can carry you.

                              MELANIE

                    So, how do we do this? The two

                    begin the ascent together.

                              RICK

                    One step at a time?

                              MELANIE

                    Side by side?

                              RICK

                    Maybe you could carry me?

          Rick jumps in Melanie's arms. They tumble to the ground under

          his weight.

                                                     CUT TO:

          INT. SMALL SUBURBAN HOME

          Rick packs his things in boxes. A knock at the door and the

          room morphs back into the cell.

                                                                 98.

          INT. SUMMIT COUNTY JAIL - CELL

          Rick turns around to see the jailer standing at the door.

                              JAILER

                    Getting out of here, huh?

                              RICK

                    It's time to move on.

                              JAILER

                    If you leave don't ever come back.

                              RICK

                    Not even...

                              JAILER

                    Not even on a visit. You're a very

                    ugly man. I'd hate to explain to

                    the other guards why you'd come to

                    visit me.

          INT. RICK'S PARENT'S HOME

          Rick's Mom and the boys are playing.

                                 KRIS

                    Grandma?

                                 MOTHER

                    Yes, Kris?

                              KRIS

                    Grandma I love you.

                              PHILLIP

                    I love her more.

                              NICHOLAS

                    I love her the whole universe.

                              MOTHER

                    I love you all the whole universe

                    plus one.

          INT. THEATER

          Rick and Melanie walk across the stage.

                                                                 99.

                              MELANIE

                    So, this is where it all happened.

                              RICK

                    It's funny, the tricks the mind can

                    play on you... but the Judge, he

                    sat right over there... and the

                    jury sat right there... and the

                    audience was filled with all these

                    people who didn't really give a

                    shit about me.

                              MELANIE

                    A bunch of innocent bystanders?

                              RICK

                    And they all sat passing judgement

                    on me, not knowing the situation,

                    just staring over their schoolmarm

                    spectacles and pointing their

                    crooked fingers.

                              MELANIE

                    All the world's a stage.

                              RICK

                    Always casting dispersions.

          Rick walks off leaving Melanie at center stage. She looks

          around. The faint echo of a Judge's gavel can be heard in the

          distance.

                              JUDGE (OS)

                    Guilty as charged.

                              MELANIE

                    Did you hear that?

                                 RICK

                    Hear what?

                              MELANIE

                    Nothing... nothing at all.

          PAN reveals: Rick, Melanie, the boys, and John sit watching a

          ball game.

                                                                   100.

                    always pay attention...

          A pregnant Carrie returns to her seat carrying a box of

          hotdogs and drinks.

                              JOHN

                    ... always be prepared for what's

                    right around the corner. The CRACK

                    of the bat.

                              RICK

                    Duck!

                              JOHN

                    Huh?

          John's POV: A foul ball is screaming in his direction.
