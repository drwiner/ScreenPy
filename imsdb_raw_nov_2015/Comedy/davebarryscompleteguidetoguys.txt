                                Jeff Arch

                             From the book by

                                Dave Barry

                                                  February 2nd, 2004

                         FADE IN:

          EXT. MIAMI - OCEAN AVE, SOUTH BEACH - DAY

          Blazing sun. MUSIC everywhere. Everybody's living la vida.

          LEOPOLD (V.0.)

          And we're good to go.

          TWO MEN come out of the BEACON HOTEL. Loud Hawaiian shirts,

          walking a Chihuahua. They pause; take in the scene on Ocean.

          Adjust their EARPIECES.

          LEOPOLD (V.0.)

          Proceed to first checkpoint and hold.

          They thread their way to the corner... across the street.. .onto

          the Promenade. Under fat shady palm trees, to a CLEARING --

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. THE ROOF OF THE BEACON HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

          AGENT STEARNS has a RIFLE with a kick-ass scope. AGENT LEOPOLD

          watches through binoculars; talks through a collar mike.

                         LEOPOLD

          Okay sit tight. Company's coming.

          THROUGH BINOCULARS NOW, as TWO DEADLY MEN approach like

          barracudas. A THIRD GUY, BEHIND THEM, the KINGPIN they're

          protecting. Then as TREETOPS BLOCK THE VIEW --

                         LEOPOLD

          Shit. Hang on.

          Leopold scans, looking for them. Searching, until he FINDS --

                         LEOPOLD

                         WHOA --

          The Hawaiian Shirt Guys hear that. The SEE the Barracudas,

          getting nearer; steal a look at the roof...

                         CUT TO:

          POV FROM ROOFTOP - THROUGH BINOCULARS - A FANTASTIC BLONDE

          rinses off at an outdoor shower. Beads of spray skip off

          her like diamonds in the sunlight.

          2.

                         STEARNS

          Oh, mama.

          She bends, twists; water streams down every delicious curve.

                         LEOPOLD

          She sure is taking her time...

                         STEARNS

          She must be really salty...

                         LEOPOLD

          (shakes his head)

          It's not just the salt. She's got

          sunscreen on. Then the sand gets on

          that, and it sticks...

          (then still watching)

          Hell, one time I was in Hawaii? And

          these three models --

                         STEARNS

          Wait a minute.

          (looks at him)

          Hawaii.

                         LEOPOLD

          -- Shit!

          He WHIPS THE BINOCULARS back: but all that's left is the

          Chihuahua. Then, walking into the spot --

                         DAVE

          Hi, I'm Dave Barry. Has something

          like this ever happened to you?

          (bends down to pet

                         THE CHIHUAHUA)

          Because if you're a guy - or if you

          know someone who is - then what you've

          just seen should look pretty familiar.

          He picks up the Chihuahua, starts walking with it.

                         DAVE

          Scientists call this condition "Lust

          Induced Brain Freeze." It affects

          millions of guys, every day, in all

          walks of life -- causing anything

          from a mild embarrassment, to an

          international incident.

          He stops. Finds LEOPOLD and STEARNS and SEVERAL OTHER AGENTS

          pointing GUNS at him.

          3.

                         LEOPOLD

          Hand over the dog.

                         DAVE

          Hey. I didn't even know it was a

          dog.

          They take it from him; rush it away. Dave turns to CAMERA.

                         DAVE

          Notice I didn't say it's a condition

          that affects men every day -- only

          guys. And that subtle but important

          difference is one of the things this

          movie is about.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          A HUSBAND and his WIFE. He has suitcases by the front door.

                         WIFE

          You'll never get away with this.

          I'll sue you down to your last penny.

                         HUSBAND

          Good luck - I transferred everything

          we own into private accounts, where

          you can't touch it. In fact, as of

          now, you're broke.

                         WIFE

          But...why?

                         HUSBAND

          I've fallen in love with another

          woman. A younger woman. Prettier,

          with no cellulite. Actually, I think

          you'd like her.

                         WIFE

          You bastard.

          The IMAGE FREEZES. Dave walks into the room.

                         DAVE

          Now clearly, this woman is dealing

          with a Man.

                         (MORE)

          4.

                         DAVE (CONT'D)

          Whereas Guys aren't capable of

          doing anything like what you just

          saw. Guys are more like this:

                         CUT TO:

          INT. A BAR/RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          A DIFFERENT HUSBAND sits across from his WIFE. Above and

          behind her is a TV with SportsCenter on.

                         WIFE

          I just want you to know, I've thought

          about this a lot.

                         GUY HUSBAND

          Mm.

                         WIFE

          And I've talked it over with everyone

          I know.

                         GUY HUSBAND

                         (NODS)

          Good.

          She looks down; stirs her soda.

                         WIFE

          So there's nothing left to do now,

          but leave you, forever, and only see

          you from across a shiny conference

          table with bloodthirsty lawyers all

          around it.

                         GUY HUSBAND

          (a beat; turns to her)

          -- Okay.

                         WIFE

          "Okay?" That's all you have to say?

          (then watching him)

          Well then I guess this is it.

          She pushes back from the table, starts off.

                         GUY HUSBAND

          Wait a minute.

                         (THEN)

          This can't be happening...

          The words she's waited for. She turns, relieved.

                         GUY HUSBAND

          (to the tv)

          How can you dQ that? How can you

          trade Lupenza?

          (then to the BARTENDER)

          What's the matter with these people?

                         BARTENDER

          Beats me. I saw this on the eight

          o'clock.

                         GUY HUSBAND

          He's the backbone of the whole team!

          They're pikers without Lupenza!

                         WIFE

          I'll see you in court.

                         GUY HUSBAND

          -- I gotta call Lenny.

          He takes out his cell phone. She levels a look.

                         WIFE

          Maybe you should call your lawyer

          too.

                         GUY HUSBAND

          If he could hit left-handed pitching,

          I would.

                         (THEN)

          Lenny. Pick up -- the Yankees got

          Lupenza!

          The IMAGE FREEZES.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. A FRONT PORCH - DAY

          Two OLD PEOPLE on a glider. LENORE talks directly to CAMERA.

          ALBERT'S absorbed with some device that we can't see.

                         LENORE

          Well when I met him, I didn't know

          so much. About guys, or men or what

          have you -- we just didn't talk about

          such things then. In fact, I didn't

          see him naked until quite well into

          our marriage. When was it Albert?

          6.

                         ALBERT

          A year ago. By accident.

                         LENORE

          Anyway. I thought I was marrying a

          man, but didn't know that in his

          heart, he was a guy.

          DAVE (O.S.)

          When did you first suspect?

                         LENORE

          Not long after the wedding. But it

          didn't bother me. I just didn't

          know how to recognize the signs.

          But we've learned to live with it.

          Haven't we, Albert?

          (then after a beat)

          Albert.

                         ALBERT

          It's twelve hundred and thirty-one

          miles from this spot right here, to

          Cleveland.

                         LENORE

          What does that have to do with

          anything?

          He holds up the device - handheld GPS.

                         ALBERT

          Six hundred fifty-one from Atlanta.

                         LENORE

          Who cares how far we are from Atlanta?

                         ALBERT

          You have a cousin there.

                         LENORE

          Albert. There's a person here asking

          us questions. There's a film crew

          here.

          He looks up at the CAMERA, as if just noticing someone there.

          Then holding up the GPS --

                         ALBERT

          You. Where do you live.

          DAVE (O.S.)

          Here in Miami.

                         ALBERT

          What part.

          Lenore buries her head.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. MIAMI BEACH - DAY

           Dave walks down a crowded street. Colorful day life.

                         DAVE

          Like a lot of big cities, Miami is

          known for its sizeable population of

          guys. So we came here to take the

          city's pulse on the subject.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. A SECRETARY'S OFFICE CUBICLE - DAY

          A young, pretty, single SECRETARY.

                         SECRETARY

          Let me put it this way. Everyone I

          ever dated was a male. I mean they

          were all men. But only some of them

          were guys. You know?

          DAVE (O.S.)

          I see.

                         SECRETARY

          (thinks about it)

          -- The guys were funnier. But the

          men were more responsible. You could

          almost half-believe them when they

          told you something sometimes.

          DAVE (O.S.)

          So, if you were to meet someone that

          was funny and responsible...

                         SECRETARY

          That would be a woman.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. EQUESTRIAN ESTATE - STABLES - DAY

           A 20-ish HORSE GROOMER talks to the CAMERA while she combs

          out a mane.

          8.

                         HORSE GROOMER

          Well guys, they're sort of like your

          older brother. And men are like

          your dad.

          DAVE (O.S.)

          In what way?

                         HORSE GROOMER

          Your older brother doesn't have to

          grow up. Your dad came that way.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. BARN - DAY

          Dave walks out of the barn towards CAMERA.

                         DAVE

          So now you have some background on

          basic guy attributes. But before we

          move on, let's look at one more scene

          and see where you stand --

                          CUT TO:

          TITLE CARD: "ROGER AND ELAINE"

          INT. ELAINE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

          ELAINE works at a window desk. ROGER watches NFL on FOX.

                         JOHN MADDEN

                         (ON TV)

          -- now that's the kind of middle

          linebacker you like to see. He's

          got the mud all over him, he's got

          the bleeding knuckles, he's got the

          clumps of grass all jammed in his

                         HELMET --

                         ELAINE

          Roger?

                         ROGER

          (to the tv)

          Oh man you gotta show that again

          Shepauses; chews her pen...

                         ELAINE

          Roger...I think I really love you.

                         (MORE)

                         9

                         ELAINE (CONT'D)

          (looks over there)

          But I can't bear the uncertainty

          anymore, of where this relationship

          is going.

          Roger turns...

                         ELAINE

          I'm not asking whether you want to

          get married. Only whether you believe

          that we have some kind of a future

          together. That you, and I - have a

          future.

                         JOHN MADDEN

          Now this is just what you want in a

          playoff game. You got snow, you got

          mud, you got a lead that keeps

          changing, you got two great teams

          that just hate each other to the

          bone and would rather die than give

          up...

          Roger looks...then takes the REMOTE and TURNS OFF THE TV -

          waving Elaine over, who cuddles into him.

                         ROGER

          I've been thinking too, Elaine. And

          for the first time in my life, I'm

          feeling like I might really be close

          to a lasting commitment. I haven't

          said anything up until now because

          it's always been important to me

          that I not mislead you. But yes,

          Elaine. I want to think that we dQ

          have a future. And with a little

          more time, I think I could be sure.

                         ELAINE

          Oh, Roger...

          He smiles. Strokes her hair and pulls her in even closer.

          They share a long deep sigh together, As the PICTURE FREEZES

          and DAVE WALKS IN.

                         DAVE

          If this was how you responded, you're

          not a guy. You may not even exist.

          (then taking the remote)

          On the other hand...

          10.

          ROGER AND ELAINE DIGITALLY REWIND BACK TO THEIR EARLIER

          POSITIONS. DAVE RESTARTS THE ACTION AS ELAINE IS SAYING --

                         ELAINE

          I'm not asking whether you want to

          get married. Only whether you believe

          that we have some kind of a future

          together. That you, and I - have a

          future.

          (then looking at him)

          Roger?

                         ROGER

          (engrossed in game)

          What.

          FREEZE on her look, and --

                         DAVE

                         (TO CAMERA)

          If that was you...you're a guy.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. A DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

          SHERYL CROW talks to the CAMERA before going onstage. The

                         SHERYL CROW

          Well there were always guys at my

          shows - right from the beginning. I

          mean you start out playing beer halls,

          right? So when you have beer, you

          have guys. And it sorta just grew

          from there. But I was okay with it.

          They didn't cause much trouble.

          DAVE (O.S.)

          And what about men.

                         SHERYL CROW

          Men cause trouble.

                         (THEN)

          But that's okay too. I get half my

          songs from that.

          DAVE (O.S.)

          So it all works out.

          So where did this all start? Many

          experts now think they know where

          men came from, but what about Guys?

          where did they come from?

          He stops, peels off a THICK BOOK full of science things.

                         DAVE

          To answer this question accurately,

          we might have to look something up.

          So instead we'll travel back to

          prehistoric sub-Saharan Africa, and

          get there just in time for the Dawn

          Be my guest.

          He hands it over. Primate Roger lays down his jagged rock

          slab to check it out. His buddies gather round.

                         PRIMATE GENE

          How do you kill an animal with that?

                         PRIMATE LOUIE

          You throw it.

          14.

          You mean you don't chase the old

          ones until they get tired and then

          hit them with the jagged rock slabs?

                         PRIMATE PETE

          You can stand in one place all day.

          And when they go by, you just let

          loose.

          He shows a throwing motion. The first four look intrigued.

                         PRIMATE LOUIE

          You can carry more than one - and if

          you're throwing uphill, it rolls

          back down if you miss. It's so much

          easier with these.

                         PRIMATE GENE

          -- I'm sticking with mine.

          (then off their looks)

          We've been using these jagged slabs

          forever. And you know why? Because

          they work. And anyway, killing them

          is only half of it -- how are you

          gonna skin a wildebeest with that?

          They look at Primate Pete: Yeah, how? But he's there.

                         PRIMATE PETE

          We get the women to do it.

          They look among themselves. They like it. But then.

          15.

          running in primitive patterns, and throwing one of the ROCKS

          back and forth and chasing whoever has it. It looks like

          the beginnings of rugby, or Australian Rules Football, in

          terms of all they need now is beer.

          The PRIMATE WOMEN watch. And trade looks. Once more,

          But you didn't kill anything.

          Nobody's going with jagged slabs

          anymore.

          Pounded roots are a side dish. They

          need balance in their diets.

          early age, guy behavior is already

          well developed along complex patterns

          that social scientists have called,

          "jerks." While girls at the same

          age are referred to by the same social

          scientists, as "human beings."

          Where are we in the area of Guy

          Violence, Doctor.

                         SCIENTIFIC EXPERT

          Well first, one must understand the

          inherent differences in DNA and cell

          structure as relates to men and women.

                         (CLICKING SLIDES)

          For example, all women have a gene

          that makes them have the need for

          meaningful conversations. Likewise,

          all men have a gene in them that we

          scientists believe is directly related

          to violence.

                         DAVE

          And what can be done about that.

                         SCIENTIFIC EXPERT

          well, some of my esteemed colleagues

          are quite keen on the idea of

          tampering with the DNA itself - an

          idea with which I heartily disagree.

          The bastards...

                         DAVE

          Then what would you recommend.

                         SCIENTIFIC EXPERT

          Me? Well they can start by spreading

          out the funding a little bit. Let a

          few other scientists wet their beaks.

          I mean what's the point of rewarding

          the same tired old hacks, year after

                         OH --

          (then shifting back)

          Well nothing, really. I mean, what

          can you do. Short of lobotomizing

          them, anyway. No I suppose we'll

          just have to continue to channel

          their aggression into socially

          acceptable outlets. Like professional

          wrestling, or the space program.

          Certainly.

          in the exam room.

                         GUY DOCTOR

          What seems to be the problem?

                         GUY PATIENT

          Well the main thing is, I keep

          coughing up blood. And I get these

          really severe chest pains, and double

          vision sometimes. And every night

          at sunset, little worms come burrowing

          out of my skin.

                         GUY DOCTOR

          It's just a sprain.

                         GUY PATIENT

          That's what I thought.

          INT. MIAMI - OUTDOOR CAFE - DAY

          Karla E, Mia, Lila and Sidra again, with Dave.

                         DAVE

          A lot has been said about how guys

          don't share their feelings.

                         31

                         KARLA E

          You mean they have them?

                         MIA

          Or they have them and don't

          acknowledge them.

                         LILA

          Or they don't think that others have

          them.

                         SIDRA

          Or they just don't think.

                         DAVE

          (as they agree on

                         THAT)

          -- Is it possible that they do have

          feelings, they do acknowledge them

          and they do know others have them -

          but they just don't express it the

          same way?

          Four blank faces look at him. Then.

                         KARLA E

          Sports. They have feelings about

          sports.

                         LILA

          And their underwear.

                         (POLLS THEM)

          You ever try and throw out their

          underwear?

                         MIA

          Once. I nearly lost my life.

                         SIDRA

          They act like it's so sacred. I've

          seen pairs of briefs with holes in

          them larger than the leg holes.

          (as the others nod)

          I tried to throw a pair out once?

          And sneak it past him? He went out

          into the garbage and found them. He

          said he couldn't trust me after that.

                         KARLA E

          Tell me what that's all about.

                         SIDRA

          I don't even want to think about it.

          32.

                         DAVE

          (off their reactions)

          So you agree then, that guys at least

          have feelings.

                         MIA

          They just waste them. That's all.

          ROGER and ELAINE get out of Roger's car. Elaine has an

          armload of magazines.

                         ELAINE

          Now remember. Gene's dad is real

          sick. Kelly says he doesn't talk

          about it. So see if you can draw

          him out.

                         ROGER

          He already did talk about it.

                         ELAINE

          Oh? What did he say?

                         ROGER

          He said his dad is real sick.

          She gives him a look. Gets to the door.

                         ROGER

          What are those?

                         ELAINE

          Kelly's boss is turning forty.

                         ROGER

          So you're giving her magazines?

                         ELAINE

          (a look; then)

          Just see if you can get him to talk.

          There's a GAME on. Gene sort of stares. Roger has a SHOEBOX

          on his lap; goes through Gene's SEGA cartridges.

                         LOOKING)

          Lupenza.

          They get everybody.

                         GENE

          I know. They suck.

                         ROGER

          I know.

          Silence. Roger pulls out two cartridges, compares them.

                         GENE

          I got to Level 24 of Arkanoids.

                         (TURNS)

          -- You're kidding.

          Gene shakes his head. He's not. This is big.

                         ROGER

          You've seen the Evil Presence?

          (then off his look)

          What's it look like?

          Gene shrugs; even the best of friends. Roger understands.

          Well I don't know. How do you think

          she feels about getting older?

                         34

                         KELLY

          I don't know... I know how I felt.

          How did you feel about it?

                         ELAINE

          How does anybody feel.

                         KELLY

                         (NODS)

          So you think she'll want a smaller

          gathering?

                         ELAINE

          Well if we go that way, we know who

          to invite.

                         KELLY

          But then who do we not invite.

                         ELAINE

          Exactly. And how are they going to

          feel about that.

                         KELLY

          So maybe we should make it a slightly

          larger gathering.

                         ELAINE

          -- Depends on the food, I guess. I

          mean, if we go with a larger

          gathering...

                         KELLY

          Exactly.

                         ELAINE

          (finds the right

                         MAGAZINE)

          I saw something earlier in here about

          low-fat hors d'oeuvres.

                         KELLY

          Oh - I've seen that one too.

          They open to the article, scanning it.

                         ELAINE

          Hmm.

                         KELLY

          Hmm.

          35.

                         ELAINE

          You thinking what I'm thinking?

                         KELLY

          That if we have low fat hors d'oeuvres

          she'll think we noticed she's gaining

          weight?

                         ELAINE

          Exactly.

                         KELLY

                         (CONSIDERS THAT)

          Maybe just blow it out, you know? I

          mean it's a party. Go with the high

          fat.

                         ELAINE

          Thinking she won't think we've noticed

          the weight gain.

                         KELLY

          Unless she thinks that's insensitive.

          You know, that we hadn't noticed...

                         ELAINE

          Hmm...

          They close the magazine, look through the others when:

                         KELLY

          How about medium fat hors d'oeuvres?

                         ELAINE

          And we could cut them into smaller

          pieces?

                         KELLY

                         (THEN)

          She could think we were being cheap.

                         ELAINE

          It's optional on the convertible.

          Beats me. Probably around the same

          time when he got the car.

                         GENE

          No shit...

                         (THEN)

          Gee...I wonder if it bothers him

          Well hey - you know? I'm not so

          sure I want this kind of a

          relationship either. Sometimes I

          wish I had a little more space, so

          I'd have time to think about whether

          I really want us to keep going this

          way. I mean, where are we going?

          Are we just going to keep seeing

          each other at this level of intimacy?

          Are we heading toward marriage?

          Toward children? Toward a lifetime

          person you enjoy being with, a person

          you truly do care about, a person

          who seems to truly care about you.

          A person who is in pain because of

          What do you mean, it's 'supposed to

          It's basic physics, Elaine. Wood

          expands. And then, later, it

          contracts.

                         ELAINE

          But we can't get out.

                         ROGER

          Which also means other people can't

          get in. That's part of the design -

          it discourages burglars.

          The same way the toaster was designed

          That was an outdoor toaster. It was

          him to keep acting like he does know,

          for reasons I believe we've covered

          in an earlier scene.

          He nods his head over to the corner, where the CAMERA PANS

          One has to understand that the act

          of emptying one's bladder goes deep

          to the very roots of masculinity.

          It is an important territorial

          I see.

          LEADING SOCIAL SCIENTIST

          In fact, many of my colleagues believe

          the reason that dogs howl at the

          moon is because they can't go up

          there and urinate on it -- which is

          not, however, a theory which I

          Happy to be here Dave.

          John, you heard what our leading

          expert said about this particular

          anxiety that guys have regarding

          bathrooms in general and public ones

          in particular. Any thoughts?

                         JOHN MADDEN

          Well he's exactly right, Dave. I

          mean the guy was a little loopy but

          he hit the nail on the head.

                         DAVE

          So an airport bathroom presents a

          specific kind of challenge.

          67.

                         JOHN MADDEN

          The worst kind, Dave, and in a lotta

          ways. Because a guy's main goal is

          to get in and outta there without

          having to deal in any other way with

          any other guy - and in an airport

          bathroom especially, with the turnover

          rate they've got, he's up against

          some pretty mean odds.

                         DAVE

          Couldn't agree more, John. Let's go

                         INSIDE --

          Okay. Now this angle here, we're

          outside the bathroom and the

          maintenance guy's just about to open

          it up.

          We SEE THE AREA OUTSIDE THE MEN'S ROOM, WITH "CLOSED FOR

          come in, he's gonna see the open

          field and he's gonna swing wide right

          to grab a spot against the wall.

          He's got one flank covered this way

          and for now he's feelin' pretty good --

          and of course by doin' that, he's

          also settin' the tone for everything

                         DAVE

          What's the main thing we're looking

          for, John. What does each individual

          guy feel he needs to get out of this.

                         JOHN MADDEN

          Well the crucial thing here, is makin'

          sure there's no eye contact. I mean

          none - zero. These guys'll look up,

          they'll look down, they'll look

          straight ahead -- but a guy would

          rather have you poke both his eyes

          out with burning hot fire tongs,

          Dave, than to give the next guy over

          a reason to think you might be lookin'

          at him in a public bathroom. For

          reasons that oughtta be pretty darn

          obvious.

                         DAVE

          Obvious indeed. Now here comes Guy

          Number Two --

          The SECOND GUY comes in; John diagrams the call.

                         JOHN MADDEN

          Now Guy Number Two, what he's gonna

          do is, he's gonna come in, see the

          first guy in position along the wall

          and right away he's gonna line up

          wide on the opposite side. This is

          a best case scenario here, something

          both these guys can appreciate.

          Plus they've opened up the middle

          for the third guy --

          The THIRD GUY comes in. John diagrams his path to the middle

          urinal. The Guy goes there.

                         DAVE

          What about eye contact in this

          situation.

                         JOHN MADDEN

          Well you're still not likely to

          encounter any, but again if you do,

          that's what that buffer zone on either

          side of him's for. And all three of

          'em are feelin' pretty lucky to have

          it, I can tell you that.

                         DAVE

          Okay. Now if things stay like this...

          69.

                         JOHN MADDEN

          If things stay like this, you're

          fine - and if this were some small

          commuter airport, y'know late at

          night or somethin', then these guys

          could possibly even be home free.

          But we're talkin' Miami International

          here, this is the big time, we're

          talking about 747's, DC-10's, the

          big jumbo jets dumpin' off three-

          four hundred people at a clip. So

          everybody's gonna be next to somebody,

          which is the last thing any of these

          guys want. You're in a critical

          mass situation, and this is where a

          lotta mistakes get made.

                         DAVE

          Which brings us to Guy Number Four.

          Here he comes --

                         JOHN MADDEN

          -- and there he goes...

          Guy #4 spins around and leaves. John and Dave watch; then.

                         DAVE

          Now one thing that I know we're going

          to get asked, John, especially from

          women, is whether, as guys, we're

          aware of how utterly stupid this

          kind of behavior really is.

                         JOHN MADDEN

          Well I think we know, Dave. Don't

          you think we know?

          area that shows up constantly at the

          when I say "euphemisms," I of course

          am not suggesting that guys don't

          have them. Guys have plenty of

          euphemisms. Most guys have more

          euphemisms in a single day - and

          here I am thinking of a day that

          occurred in the summer between ninth

          and tenth grades - than some women

          have in a lifetime - or longer, in

          the case of certain Math Teachers.

                         DAVE

          It all goes back to a time, millions

          of years ago, when primitive males

          often had to complete their part of

          the equation quickly and right away

          stand ready to fight off attackers.

                         DAVE

          Today, however, women want euphemisms

          too -- and this ability in males is

          no longer as prized as it once was.

                         DAVE (CONT'D)

          In fact, when modern women describe

          the qualities they're looking for in

          the ideal man, the phrase "a real

          fast shooter" is usually pretty far

          down the list.

                         (THEN STOPPING)

          Naturally, it fell to guys to do

          something about this. So, naturally -

          they did.

          one technique for holding back the

          inevitable, is when the guy - just

          when he is about to have his euphemism -

          will hurl himself violently into an

          iron bed railing, and raise a lump

          on his head the size of a golf ball.

          In cases where there aren't any iron

          can be found right on the end of the

          One of the most time honored and

          the Baseball Method --

          -- how's it going, Champ.

          Roger pokes his head out of the blanket; stays active from

          the neck down.

          Oh - yeah hi.

                         (ACKNOWLEDGES CAMERA;

          then to Dave)

          Well, the baseball thing. I mean a

          while ago I was into that - big time.

          You know, fooling around with

          different lineups, mixing up the

          batting order - like thinking about

          what would happen if you took your

          cleanup guy and made him eighth or

          something -- just something stupid

          like that, you know? Stuff you'd

          never really do.

          shuffling my pitching staff around,

          or thinking about who I might try

          and sign at the winter meetings.

          The thing is, it got stale. And I

          found after a while I wasn't enjoying

          sex or baseball that much. And you

          don't want to mess with that stuff.

          Really?

          train leaves Denver at two o'clock

          and they're going at different speeds?

                         ROGER

          I can't do train ones. I always end

          up imagining this beautiful girl on

          This is basically where we stand

          today. The only difference is, we

          have way more standards.

          (gives the ROCK to a

          KID passing by)

          There are social standards, about

          being sensitive - remembering

          anniversaries, listening during

          conversations, not eating soup with

          your hands, or sitting around in

          your underwear when company's over.

          -- And there are thousands of

          standards for domestic life, involving

          even more totally un-guy concepts --

          like curtains, bedspreads, napkins,

          special hangers, little soaps shaped

          like fruit, and decorative boxes

          that hold tissues that already come

          in a box. While guys, left on their

          own in the wild, will develop

          lifestyles that don't involve any of

          these things.

          of course, even by the most basic

          savages. But they honestly don't

          know this -- because Guys, in their

          natural state, aren't any more aware

          of domestic standards than a trout

          Laundry's a big issue - and a deep

          tapeworms are just tapeworms - that's

          all they are, and all they'll ever

          be. They're just these repulsive

          little parasitic beasts and nobody

          They leave their dirty dishes

          cereal bowl with yuckola blobs of

          God knows what in them. And the

          They really do get cleaned by magic!

          Because I can't take seeing them sit

          So now that we've heard your thoughts.

          The others turn, look her way.

                         LILA

          -- I mean don't get me wrong. They

          really can be fun. You know, like a

          big stupid dog can be fun. I mean

          not everything has to be so serious

          in life. You want to be able to do

          more with someone than just read

          book reviews together - which is

          something a guy would never do anyway.

          (then as the others

                         LISTEN CLOSER)

          But what a guy will do? Is at eleven

          o'clock at night he'll show up at

          your door and bring cheese steaks.

          And he doesn't care that you look

          all rumply and dreadful from not

          expecting anyone. He might not even

          remember that you're a vegetarian

          and don't eat cheese steaks -- but

          that doesn't really matter either.

          Because the point is he wanted one,

          and he can't come out and say it but

          he didn't want to eat it alone.

                         MIA

          And you're the person he thought of.

                         LILA

          (off her look; nods)

          I can't tell you what that feels

          like, when they do that.

          I swear, if they knew how adorable

          they are sometimes, they'd be
