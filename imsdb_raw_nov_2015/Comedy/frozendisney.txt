   OPEN ON: ICE.

   We're underwater looking up at it. A saw cuts through,

   heading right for us.

   EXT. SNOW-CAPPED MOUNTAINS -- DUSK

   ICE HARVESTERS, dressed in traditional Sami clothing, score a

   frozen lake. They SING.

                   "The Frozen Heart (Ice Worker's Song)"

                            ICE HARVESTERS

                  BORN OF COLD AND WINTER AIR

                  AND MOUNTAIN RAIN COMBINING,

                  THIS ICY FORCE BOTH FOUL AND FAIR

                  HAS A FROZEN HEART WORTH MINING.

   The men drag giant ice blocks through channels of water.

                            ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)

                  CUT THROUGH THE HEART, COLD AND CLEAR.

                  STRIKE FOR LOVE AND STRIKE FOR FEAR.

                  SEE THE BEAUTY SHARP AND SHEER.

                  SPLIT THE ICE APART!

                  AND BREAK THE FROZEN HEART.

                  Hup! Ho! Watch your step! Let it go!

   A young Sami boy, KRISTOFF (8), and his reindeer calf, SVEN,

   share a carrot as they try to keep up with the men.

                            ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)

                  Hup! Ho! Watch your step! Let it go!

   Young Kristoff struggles to get a block of ice out of the

   water. He fails, ends up soaked. Sven licks his wet cheek.

                            ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)

                  BEAUTIFUL! POWERFUL! DANGEROUS! COLD!

                  ICE HAS A MAGIC CAN'T BE CONTROLLED.

   A sharp ice floe overtakes the workers, threateningly. They

   fight it back.

                            ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)

                  STRONGER THAN ONE, STRONGER THAN TEN

                  STRONGER THAN A HUNDRED MEN!

   Massive fjord horses drag heavy ice plows.

                                                                2

   The sun sets. Lanterns are lit.

                  THIS ICY FORCE BOTH FOUL AND FAIR

                  HAS A FROZEN HEART WORTH MINING.

                  CUT THROUGH THE HEART, COLD AND CLEAR.

   In the dark, Kristoff and Sven finally manage to get a single

   block of ice out of the water.

                            ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)

                  STRIKE FOR LOVE AND STRIKE FOR FEAR.

                  THERE'S BEAUTY AND THERE'S DANGER HERE.

                  SPLIT THE ICE APART!

                  BEWARE THE FROZEN HEART.

   The workers pile onto the giant horse-drawn ice sled as it

   pulls away.

   Left behind, Kristoff and Sven push their ice block onto a

   dinky little sled then head off.

   We sweep up from them to the Northern Lights filling the

   sky...then move across the mountains...beneath the

   snowline...and descend upon...

   EXT. THE KINGDOM OF ARENDELLE -- NIGHT

   A humble castle, built of wood, nestled in a deep fjord.

   INT. CASTLE, NURSERY -- NIGHT

   ELSA (8) sleeps in her bed. Her little sister ANNA (5) pops

   up beside her.

                            YOUNG ANNA

                  Elsa. Psst. Elsa! Psst.

   Elsa doesn't stir. Anna sits on Elsa and bounces.

                            YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)

                  Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

                            YOUNG ELSA

                      (grumbling)

                  Anna, go back to sleep.

   Anna rolls onto her back and spreads all her weight on Elsa.

                                                              3

FROZEN - J. Lee

                            YOUNG ANNA

                      (drama queen-ish)

                  I just can't. The sky's awake, so

                  I'm awake, so we have to play.

                            YOUNG ELSA

                  ...Go play by yourself.

   Elsa shoves Anna off the bed.

   Anna lands butt to floor, sighs, defeated. But then she gets

   an idea. She hops back on the bed and lifts one of Elsa's

   eyelids.

                            YOUNG ANNA

                      (mischievously)

                  Do you want to build a snowman?

   Elsa's eyes both pop open. She smiles.

   INT. CASTLE STAIRCASE -- NIGHT

   Anna, now wearing snow boots, pulls Elsa by the hand.

                            YOUNG ANNA

                  Come on, come on, come on, come on.

   Elsa tries to shush her, but Anna's too excited.

   INT. BALLROOM -- NIGHT

   The girls sneak into the ballroom. Elsa shuts the door.

                            YOUNG ANNA

                  Do the magic! Do the magic!

   Elsa laughs and waves her hands together. Snowflakes suddenly

   burst forth and dance between her palms, forming a snowball.

   Elsa throws the snowball high into the air. Snow bursts out

   and flurries around the room. Anna dances about, catching

   flakes in her palms and mouth.

                            YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)

                  This is amazing!

                            YOUNG ELSA

                  Watch this!

   Elsa stomps her little slippered foot and a layer of ice

   suddenly coats the floor, forming a giant ice rink. Anna

   slides off, laughing.

                                                              4

FROZEN - J. Lee

   PLAY MONTAGE:

   -Anna and Elsa roll giant snowballs and build a snowman

   together. Elsa moves his stick arms around.

                            YOUNG ELSA (CONT'D)

                      (goofy voice)

                  Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs.

   Anna jumps up and hugs him.

                            YOUNG ANNA

                  I love you, Olaf.

   -Anna and Olaf appear to be dancing. REVEAL: Elsa is actually

   propelling them across the ice floor with her magic.

   -The girls slide down snowbanks together!

   -Anna fearlessly jumps off a snow peak into mid air.

                              YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)

                  Catch me!

   Elsa makes another peak to catch Anna.

                              YOUNG ELSA

                  Gotcha!

   Anna keeps jumping. Elsa keeps casting magic.

                            YOUNG ANNA

                      (jumping faster)

                  Again! Again!

                             YOUNG ELSA

                      (struggling to keep up)

                  Slow down!

   Elsa suddenly slips.

   Her magic accidentally STRIKES Anna in the head. Anna tumbles

   down a snowbank and lands, unconscious.

                              YOUNG ELSA (CONT'D)

                  ANNA!

   Elsa runs to Anna and takes her in her arms. A streak of

   Anna's hair, where struck, turns white.

                            YOUNG ELSA (CONT'D)

                  MAMA! PAPA!

   The room around them fills with frightening ice spikes.

                                                                     5

FROZEN - J. Lee

   The parents burst through the frozen door. GASP at the sight

   of the room.

                            KING

                  Elsa, what have you done? This is

                  getting out of hand!

                            QUEEN

                      (seeing Anna)

                  Anna!

   The King and Queen rush to Anna and take her in their arms.

                            ELSA

                  It was an accident. I'm sorry,

                  Anna.

                            QUEEN

                      (about Anna)

                  She's ice cold.

                            KING

                  ...I know where we have to go.

                                                      SLAM CUT TO:

   INT. DARK ROOM -- NIGHT

   The King sifts through a shelf to find an ancient book

   inscribed with Old Norse runes. He opens the book, scrambles

   to a page with an ancient map.

   EXT. ARENDELLE -- NIGHT

   Carrying the girls, the King and Queen ride their horses out

   of the kingdom. Snow streams from Elsa's hands, leaving a

   trail of ice behind them.

   EXT. FJORD MOUNTAIN FOREST -- NIGHT

   A sleepy Kristoff and Sven travel alone through the dark

   woods. All of a sudden, the King and Queen race by with the

   girls, leaving the wake of ice.

                            KRISTOFF

                  Ice?

                                                      SLAM CUT TO:

                                                                6

FROZEN - J. Lee

   EXT. BLACK MOUNTAINS -- NIGHT

   Kristoff rides Sven as they follow the trail of ice.

                            YOUNG KRISTOFF

                  Faster, Sven!

   EXT. THE VALLEY OF THE LIVING ROCK -- NIGHT

   Kristoff hops off Sven at the edge of a deep valley. They

   hide behind a rock and peek out.

   Down below, the King holds a frightened Elsa. The Queen holds

   the still unconscious Anna.

                            KING

                  Please, help. My daughter!

   Suddenly, a bunch of rocks tumble down the valley toward

   them. It looks as though they'll be crushed!

   But, luckily, the rocks stop at their feet. The rocks then

   unfold, revealing bright faces.

                               YOUNG KRISTOFF

                  Trolls...?

   The rock in front of Kristoff "wakes up." Meet BULDA.

                            BULDA

                  Shush. I'm trying to listen.

   She grabs Kristoff and Sven by hand and hoof and hugs them

   close. Sven licks her face and she eyes them both.

                            BULDA (CONT'D)

                  Cuties. I'm gonna keep you.

   Back below, the crowd parts for a troll as old as the Earth.

   They call him GRAND PABBIE. He approaches arthritically, but

   determined. He nods respectfully to the king.

                            GRAND PABBIE

                  Your Majesty.

                      (referring to Elsa)

                  Born with the powers or cursed?

                            KING

                  Born. And they're getting stronger.

   Grand Pabbie motions for the Queen to bring Anna to him. She

   does. He examines her.

                                                              7

FROZEN - J. Lee

                            GRAND PABBIE

                      (about Anna)

                  You are lucky it wasn't her heart.

                  The heart is not so easily changed,

                  but the head can be persuaded.

                            KING

                  Do what you must.

                            GRAND PABBIE

                  I recommend we remove all magic,

                  even memories of magic to be

                  safe.... But don't worry, I'll

                  leave the fun.

   Grand Pabbie pulls out a glowing blue energy from Anna's

   head. We see her memories floating right above her. Grand

   Pabbie changes all of her magical memories to ordinary

   memories -- snowy play indoors with the girls in their

   nightgowns changes to outdoors on the winter fjords with the

   girls in winter gear. He puts the ordinary memories back in

   her head.

                            GRAND PABBIE (CONT'D)

                  She will be okay.

                            YOUNG ELSA

                  But she won't remember I have

                  powers?

                            KING

                  It's for the best.

                             PABBIE

                  Listen to me, Elsa, your power will

                  only grow.

   As he speaks, he conducts the Northern Lights to show a

   silhouette of an adult Elsa creating magical snowflakes.

                            PABBIE (CONT'D)

                  There is beauty in your magic....

                  But also great danger.

   The snowflakes turn to sharp spikes.

                           PABBIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)

                  You must learn to control it.

   In the Northern Lights display, the sharp spikes cause human

   figures to panic and attack Elsa.

                            PABBIE (CONT'D)

                  Fear will be your enemy.

                                                                     8

FROZEN - J. Lee

   Elsa gasps and buries her face in the King's chest. The King

   wraps his arms around Elsa, protectively.

                            KING

                  No. We'll protect her. She can

                  learn to control it. I'm sure.

   Over the King's words we...

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

   -The Arendelle castle gates shutting.

                            KING (O.S.) (CONT'D)

                  Until then, we'll lock the gates.

                  We'll reduce the staff. We will

                  limit her contact with people and

                  keep her powers hidden from

                  everyone... including Anna.

   -The castle shutters close.

   -Anna sits on her bed as Elsa's furniture disappears.

   -Anna rushes to the hall to see Elsa shut the door to her new

   room. Anna watches, confused and sad.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

   INT. CASTLE WINDOW -- DAY

   We look out on a gentle snowfall. Little Anna skips up to the

   window. She lights up at the sight of the snow and rushes

   down the hall.

   INT. HALLWAY, ELSA'S DOOR -- DAY

   Anna knocks on Elsa's door and SINGS.

                     "Do You Want to Build a Snowman?"

                            YOUNG ANNA

                  DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN?

                  COME ON LET'S GO AND PLAY.

   Anna peeks under the door.

                            YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)

                  I NEVER SEE YOU ANYMORE.

                  COME OUT THE DOOR.

                  IT'S LIKE YOU'VE GONE AWAY.

                                                                 9

FROZEN - J. Lee

   -INT. ANNA'S ROOM -- Anna plays with two dolls, gives up, sad.

                            YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)

                  WE USED TO BE BEST BUDDIES

                  AND NOW WE'RE NOT.

                  I WISH YOU WOULD TELL ME WHY.

   -ELSA'S DOOR. Anna peeks through the key hole.

                            YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)

                  DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN?

   -Anna calls through the keyhole.

                            YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)

                  IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A SNOWMAN.

                            YOUNG ELSA (O.S.)

                  Go away, Anna.

                            YOUNG ANNA

                      (hearbroken)

                  ...OKAY BYE.

   -BEHIND THE DOOR -- DAY. Elsa sits at the window looking out,

   longingly. Suddenly, her icy hands freeze the windowsill.

   -LATER. The King slips leather gloves onto Elsa's hands.

                            KING

                  The gloves will help.

   He pats her gloved hand.

                            KING (CONT'D)

                  See? You're good....

                      (starting their mantra)

                  Conceal it.

                            YOUNG ELSA

                  Don't feel it.

                            YOUNG ELSA & KING

                  Don't let it show.

   -INT. HALLWAY, ELSA'S DOOR -- DAY. Anna, now 9, knocks on

   Elsa's door.

                            ANNA (9)

                  DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN?

   -INT. HALLWAY -- DAY. Alone, Anna rides a bicycle built for

   two in the hall by standing on the back seat.

                                                               10

                  I THINK SOME COMPANY IS OVERDUE...

   -INT. PORTRAIT ROOM -- DAY. Anna runs around the portrait

   room, gaining momentum to flip over the arm of the couch.

                            ANNA (9) (CONT'D)

                  I'VE STARTED TALKING TO

                  THE PICTURES ON THE WALLS.

   Anna lands PLOP on the cushions, then looks up at the

   painting above her of the courageous Joan of Arc.

                            ANNA (9) (CONT'D)

                  Hang in there, Joan.

   -INT. EMPTY LIBRARY -- DAY. Looks like no one's around.

                            ANNA (9) (CONT'D)

                  IT GETS A LITTLE LONELY

                  ALL THESE EMPTY ROOMS.

   But then we find Anna, laying at the base of the grandfather

   clock, playing with her braids, bored out of her mind.

                            ANNA (9) (CONT'D)

                  JUST WATCHING THE HOURS TICK BY.

   Anna's eyes follow the grandfather clock's pendulum.

                            ANNA (9) (CONT'D)

                  TICK TOCK. TICK TOCK. TICK TOCK.

   -INT. ELSA'S ROOM -- NIGHT. Elsa (now 12) paces as she panics.

   The entire wall is frozen behind her.

                            ELSA (12)

                  I'm scared. It's getting stronger.

                            KING

                  Getting upset only makes it worse.

   The King goes to hug her.

                            ELSA (12)

                  No. Don't touch me. I don't want to

                  hurt you.

   He and the Queen look at each other with alarmed sadness.

   -INT. LIBRARY -- DAY. Anna, now a teenager, slides past Elsa's

   room without stopping.

                                                                11

                  See you in two weeks.

   -INT. ELSA'S ROOM -- DAY. Elsa curtsies in front of her

   parents, formally, not touching them.

                            TEEN ELSA

                  Do you have to go?

                            KING

                  You'll be fine, Elsa.

   -EXT. DOCKS -- DAY. The King and Queen leave on a ship.

   -EXT. ROUGH SEAS -- NIGHT. Lightning flashes. The sea rages in

   a storm. The King and Queen's ship is lost in the waves.

   -INT. CASTLE -- DAY. A portrait of the King and Queen is

   covered in mourning cloth.

   -EXT. CEMETERY -- DAY. Anna looks small, standing before her

   people, beside burial stones.

   -INT. HALLWAY, ELSA'S DOOR. Anna, still in her mourning

   clothes, approaches and knocks.

                            ANNA

                      (singing)

                  Elsa? PLEASE I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE

                  PEOPLE ARE ASKING WHERE YOU'VE BEEN

                  PLEASE LET ME IN.

   Anna slides down the door and sits with her head against it.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)

                  WE ONLY HAVE EACH OTHER.

                  IT'S JUST YOU AND ME.

                  WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

                      (weak, internal)

                  DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN?

   We move through the door...

   -INT. ELSA'S ROOM -- DAY. Elsa is sitting in the exact same

   pose as Anna. Her bedroom is frozen with ice. Snowflakes hang

   in the air, suspended by grief.

                                                        FADE OUT.

   EXT. THE KINGDOM OF ARENDELLE -- MORNING

   A new dawn rises over the fjords.

   Ships pull up to the docks. Guests pile out.

                            DOCK MASTER

                  Welcome to Arendelle!

   A BOY tries to get away as his MOTHER tries to stuff him in

   his bunad jacket.

                            BOY

                  Why do I have to wear this?

                            MOTHER

                  Because the Queen has come of age.

                  It's Coronation Day!

                            BOY

                  That's not my fault.

   They pass the May Pole being raised and a Sami ice harvester

   chatting with his reindeer. We recognize them as Kristoff and

   Sven, all grown up. Sven hops around excitedly like a dog and

   nuzzles Kristoff's chest.

                            KRISTOFF

                  What do you want, Sven?

   Kristoff leans in and speaks for Sven, as if he can.

                            KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D)

                  Give me a snack.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

                  What's the magic word?

                            KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D)

                  Please!

   Kristoff pulls a carrot out of his shirt pocket and hands it

   to Sven. Sven tries to bite the whole thing.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

                  Hey, hey, hey! Share!

   Sven takes a smaller bite. Kristoff then has a bite himself,

   not seeming to care that it's covered in reindeer slobber.

   We move on to PERSI and AGGIE, a super-excited couple who

   rush towards the castle.

                                                              13

                  I can't believe they're finally

                  opening up the gates!

                            AGGIE

                  And for a whole day! Faster, Persi!

   They pass a tiny but menacing DUKE, who wears taps on his

   shoes to "enhance" his presence. Two THUG guards follow close

   behind him.

                            DUKE

                  Ah, Arendelle, our most mysterious

                  trade partner. Open those gates so

                  I may unlock your secrets and

                  exploit your riches.

                      (catching himself)

                  ...Did I just say that out loud?

   We leave him and head down the bridge towards the castle

   gates, passing an Irishman and a Spanish Dignitary.

                            IRISHMAN

                  Oh, me sore eyes can't wait to see

                  the Queen and the Princess. I bet

                  they're absolutely lovely.

                            SPANISH DIGNITARY

                  I bet they are beautiful.

   We move past them, to a particular castle window.

   Anna sits up. She's got major bedhead. She coughs. Snorts.

   Pulls a hair from her mouth.

                            ANNA

                  ...Huh? Yeah?

                  My sister's cor-neration...

   One eye opens enough to catch sight of her coronation dress.

   She bolts, wide awake in excitement.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)

                  Coronation Day! Ha ha!

   EXT. CASTLE HALL -- DAY

   Anna bursts out of her room, wearing her coronation dress.

   She finishes pinning ribbons in her hair. Seeing the hustle

   and bustle of preparations, she can't help but SING.

                       "For the First Time in Forever"

                            ANNA

                  I DIDN'T KNOW THEY DID THAT ANYMORE.

                  WHO KNEW WE OWNED 8000 SALAD PLATES...?

   -Anna slides along the floor of the ballroom in her socks.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)

                  FOR YEARS I HAVE ROAMED THESE EMPTY HALLS

   evidence.

                  BUT WOW AM I SO READY FOR THIS CHANGE!

   -Anna comes to a window and jumps out onto a window washer's

   pulley. She raises herself up to see the ships arriving.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)

   -Anna walks through the garden and follows a family of geese.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)

                  DON'T KNOW IF I'M ELATED OR GASSY,

                  I can't wait to meet everyone....

                  (GASP) What if I meet THE ONE?

   -Anna twists herself in a velvet drape like it's a gown. She

   acts like she looks gorgeous, but she looks ridiculous.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)

                  TONIGHT, IMAGINE ME GOWN AND ALL-

                  FETCHINGLY DRAPED AGAINST THE WALL.

                  THE PICTURE OF SOPHISTICATED GRACE.

   -She notices the bust of a man across the room.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)

                      (google-eyed)

                  I SUDDENLY SEE HIM STANDING THERE,

                  NOTHING LIKE THE LIFE I'VE LED SO FAR.

   The bust goes flying and lands on the top of the cake.

   -Anna bursts into the portrait room, bounces on the

   furniture, and interacts with the paintings.

                                                               16

                  BE THE GOOD GIRL

                  YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BE.

   Elsa moves to a painting of her father's coronation. She

   takes off her gloves and mimics the painting by holding a

   candlestick and ornament in place of an orb and scepter.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)

                  MAKE ONE WRONG MOVE

                  AND EVERYONE WILL KNOW.

   The candlestick and ornament ice over. Elsa gasps, slams them

   back down onto the table. She tries to reassure herself.

   -Anna SLAMS right into the breast of a HORSE!

   She falls back and lands in a small wooden boat. It tips off

   of the dock. She's heading overboard. But just then, the

   horse slams his hoof into the boat and steadies it.

                  I'm so sorry. Are you hurt?

   The rider, HANS, sure is handsome and regal.

                            ANNA

                      (gentler)

                  Hey. I-ya, no. No. I'm okay.

                            HANS

                  Are you sure?

                            ANNA

                  Yeah, I just wasn't looking where I

                  was going. But I'm okay.

   He hops down from his horse and steps into the boat.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)

                  I'm great, actually.

                            HANS

                  Oh, thank goodness.

   He offers her a hand and their eyes meet. Chemistry. He helps

   her to her feet.

                            HANS (CONT'D)

                      (bowing)

                  Prince Hans of the Southern Isles.

                            ANNA

                      (curtseying)

                  Princess Anna of Arendelle.

                            HANS

                  Princess...? My Lady.

   He drops to his knees, head bowed. The horse bows too,

   curling his hoof up and out of the boat.

   The boat tips. Hans tumbles on top of Anna. Awkward.

                            ANNA

                  Hi...again.

   The horse slams his foot back into the boat to stabilize it.

   Anna and Hans tumble the other way. Anna lands on top of him.

                            HANS

                  Oh boy.

                            ANNA

                  Ha. This is awkward. Not you're

                  awkward, but just because we're--

                  I'm awkward. You're gorgeous.

                      (did she just say that?)

                  Wait, what?

   Hans quickly gets to his feet and helps Anna up again.

                            HANS

                  I'd like to formally apologize for

                  hitting the Princess of Arendelle

                  with my horse...and for every

                  moment after.

                            ANNA

                  No. No-no. It's fine. I'm not THAT

                  Princess. I mean, if you'd hit my

                  sister Elsa, that would be-- yeash!

                  `Cuz, you know...

                      (patting the horse)

                  Hello.

                      (to Hans)

                  But, lucky you, it's-it's just me.

                              HANS

                  Just you?

   Hans smiles, amused. She smiles back. The bells RING. She

   doesn't notice at first; she's too busy drinking in Hans's

   handsomeness.

                            ANNA

                  ...The bells. The coronation. I-I-I

                  better go. I have to...I better go.

   She hurries off, stops, turns back. Gives Hans a little wave.

                              ANNA (CONT'D)

                  Bye!

   As she rushes off again, Hans waves back. The horse waves

   too, once again taking his hoof out of the boat.

                              HANS

                  Oh no.

   The boat falls, with Hans in it. SPLASH! It lands upside down

   in the water. Hans raises it up off of him, gasping for air.

                                                         CUT TO:

   INT. CHURCH CHAPEL -- DAY

   Elsa stands at the alter. Anna stands off to one side. She

   peeks out to the audience.

   Hans waves at her from the pews. He's changed his clothes.

   The crown is placed on Elsa's head. The scepter and orb are

   presented to Elsa on a pillow. She slowly reaches for them.

                            BISHOP

                      (a whisper)

                  Your Majesty, the gloves.

   Elsa hesitates. She breathes nervously, removes her gloves,

   places them on the pillow. Her hands shake. She takes the orb

   and scepter, then turns to the people.

                            BISHOP (CONT'D)

   The scepter and orb start to freeze over.

                            BISHOP (CONT'D)

                  ...Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

                            CROWD

                  Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

   Just in time. Elsa manages to set the orb and scepter back

   down on the pillow before anyone notices the ice. She picks

   up her gloves and slips them on. She made it.

                                                        CUT TO:

   INT. GREAT HALL -- NIGHT

   Springy music fills the Great Hall. Guests dance. Eat. Laugh.

   TRUMPETS SOUND.

                            KAI

                      (announcing)

                  Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

   Elsa enters, poised and looking surprisingly content. She

   stands under a formal awning.

                            KAI (CONT'D)

                  Princess Anna of Arendelle!

   Anna runs into the room, waves awkwardly. Kai ushers her over

   to stand right next to Elsa.

                            ANNA

                  Here? Are you sure?

   She and Elsa sneak awkward peeks at each other.

                            ELSA

                  ...Hi.

                            ANNA

                  Hi me...? Oh. Um. Hi.

                  ...You look beautiful.

                  Thank you. You look beautifuller. I

                  mean, not fuller. You don't look

                  fuller, but more beautiful.

                               ELSA

                  Thank you.

   They look out at the celebration.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)

                  So, this is what a party looks

                  like?

                            ANNA

                  It's warmer than I thought.

                            ELSA

                  And what is that amazing smell?

   They both close their eyes and inhale.

                            ANNA AND ELSA (TOGETHER)

                  ...Chocolate.

   Their eyes pop open. They laugh.

   Elsa looks back out at the party. Anna looks at Elsa. She

   wants to say so much, but she can't think of where to start.

   Just as she finds her way, Kai interrupts.

                            KAI

                  Your Majesty. The Duke of

                  Weaseltown.

                            DUKE

                  Weselton. The Duke of Weselton.

                      (to Elsa)

                  Your Majesty, as your closest

                  partner in trade, it seems only

                  fitting that I offer you your first

                  dance as queen.

   The Duke does a funny flitter of his feet, a hitch-kick, and

   a deep bow.

                            DUKE (CONT'D)

                      (whispers to himself)

                  One, two, three. Jump.

   As he holds out his hand, head down, his toupee dips forward.

   Anna giggles. Elsa looks at Anna, stifles a giggle herself.

                            ELSA

                      (to the Duke)

                  Thank you...only I don't dance.

                                                               22

                            ELSA

                  But my sister does.

                            ANNA

                  What?

                            DUKE

                  Lucky you....

                            ANNA

                  Oh, I don't think--

   The Duke grabs Anna's arm and yanks her away before she can

   protest.

                             DUKE

                  If you swoon, let me know, I'll

                  catch you.

   Anna looks back at Elsa, desperately.

                            ELSA

                  Sorry.

   OUT ON THE DANCE FLOOR: The Duke showboats, but he's just

   awful. Anna tries to make the best of it.

                            DUKE

                  Like an agile peacock... CLUCK-

                  CLUGGLE-CLUCK!

   He lands on her feet.

                            ANNA

                  Ow. Ow.

                            DUKE

                  Speaking of, so great to have the

                  gates open. Why did they shut them

                  in the first place? Do you know the

                  reason? Hmm?

   He gets in her face, suspicious.

                            ANNA

                  ...No.

                                                                   23

FROZEN - J. Lee

                  Oh, all right. Hang on. They don't

                  call me the little dipper for

                  nothing.

   He dips Anna back. Elsa peeks through the crowd, can barely

   hold in her laughter. Anna shoots Elsa funny, help-me looks.

                            DUKE (CONT'D)

                      (groove fully on)

                  Like a chicken...with the face of a

                  monkey...I fly.

                                                        JUMP CUT TO:

   MOMENTS LATER...

   Anna limps back to Elsa.

                            DUKE (O.S.)

                  Let me know when you're ready for

                  another round, M'Lady.

                            ELSA

                  Well, he was sprightly.

                            ANNA

                      (rubbing her sore feet)

                  Especially for a man in heels.

                            ELSA

                  Are you okay?

                            ANNA

                      (loving Elsa's attention)

                  I've never been better. This is so

                  nice. I wish it could be like this

                  all the time.

                      (sincere)

                  Me too....

   But then Elsa catches herself. She stiffens up, looks away.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)

                  But it can't.

                            ANNA

                  Why not? If--

                            ELSA

                  It just can't.

                                                                24

   Anna's smile drops. She tries not to get emotional.

                            ANNA

                  Excuse me for a minute.

   She walks away. Elsa watches her go, saddened.

   Moving through the crowd, Anna gets bumped by a bowing man's

   butt. She falls. Just before she hits the floor, Hans catches

   her. He smiles perfectly.

                            HANS

                  Glad I caught you.

                               ANNA

                  Hans.

   He smoothly sets his drink down on a passing tray. He lifts

   her up and leads her in a romantic dance.

                  myself to slide... Oops. Sorry.

   She hits him in the face by mistake with her hand. He laughs.

   EXT. BALCONY -- NIGHT

   Anna teaches Hans how to eat krumkake.

                            ANNA

                  Yeah, the whole thing! You got it.

   They laugh as the krumkake crumbles in his face.

                            ANNA(CONT'D)

                  Okay wait, wait. So you have how

                  many brothers?

                            HANS

                  Twelve older brothers. Three of

                  them pretended I was invisible...

                  literally...for two years.

                            ANNA

                  That's horrible.

                            HANS

                  It's what brothers do.

                  ...And sisters. Elsa and I were

                  really close when we were little.

                  But then, one day she just shut me

                  out, and I never knew why.

   He takes her hand. Leans in close.

                  I'VE BEEN SEARCHING MY WHOLE LIFE

                  TO FIND MY OWN PLACE.

   They jump to the neighboring balcony and enter a door.

   They come out on top of one of the castle's towers.

   We next find them strutting on a bridge ledge.

   Are they doing the robot? No. They're imitating the

   Anna and Hans dance on top of the lighthouse and cast dancing

   shadows across the sails of ships in the docks.

   INT. BALL -- NIGHT

   Anna pushes through the crowd towards Elsa, Hans in tow.

                  Oops! Pardon. Sorry. Can we just

                  get around you there? Thank you.

                  Oh, there she is. Elsa!

   Elsa turns to Anna. Anna curtseys awkwardly.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)

                  I mean...Queen.... Me again. Um.

                  May I present Prince Hans of the

                      (bowing)

                  Your Majesty.

   Elsa gives a polite but reserved curtsey.

                            ANNA

                  We would like--

                            HANS

                  Well, we haven't worked out all the

                  details ourselves. We'll need a few

                  days to plan the ceremony. Of

                  course we'll have soup, roast, and

                  ice cream and then--

                  Wait. Would we live here?

                  Of course we have the room. I don't

                  know. Some of them must--

                            ELSA

                  Wait. Slow down. No one's brothers

                  are staying here. No one is getting

                  married.

                            ANNA

                  Wait, what?

                            ELSA

                  May I talk to you, please. Alone.

   Anna sees Hans's worried face. Hooks arms with him.

                            ANNA

                  No. Whatever you have to say, you-

                  you can say to both of us.

                            ELSA

                  Fine. You can't marry a man you

                  just met.

                            ANNA

                  You can if it's true love.

                            ELSA

                  Anna, what do you know about true

                  love?

                            ANNA

                  More than you. All you know is how

                  to shut people out.

                            ELSA

                  You asked for my blessing, but my

                  answer is no. Now, excuse me.

                                                              31

                  No, you may not. And I-I think you

                  should go.

   Elsa walks away. As she passes the Royal Handler--

                            ELSA (CONT'D)

                  The party is over. Close the gates.

                            ANNA

                  What? Elsa, no. No, wait!

   Anna grabs Elsa's hand. She pulls off Elsa's glove. Elsa

   gasps, spins around and reaches for the glove in panic.

                            ELSA

                  Give me my glove!

   Anna holds the glove away from Elsa.

                            ANNA

                      (desperate)

                  Elsa, please. Please. I can't live

                  like this anymore.

   Elsa fights tears.

                             ELSA

                      (weak)

                  ...Then leave.

   Elsa sees Anna's hurt face. It's too much. She can't hold it

   in. She turns and rushes away.

                            ANNA

                      (heartbroken)

                  ...What did I ever do to you?!

   The party goes silent as everyone watches the sisters.

                            ELSA

                  Enough, Anna.

                            ANNA

                  No. Why? Why do you shut me out?!

                  Why do you shut the world out?!

                  What are you so afraid of?!

                            ELSA

                  I said, enough!

                  Elsa...?

   Elsa rushes out of the room.

   Elsa ducks through the crowd, holding her bare hand.

                  Queen Elsa.

                            TOWNSWOMAN WITH BABY

                  Your Majesty? Are you all right?

   Elsa backs away from the baby. She knocks into the fountain,

   grabs its edge. The waters freeze at her touch.

   GASPS of shock and fear sweep over the crowd.

   The Duke and thugs come out the door.

                            DUKE

                  There she is! Stop her!

                  Please, just stay away from me.

                  Stay away!

   Magic accidentally shoots from her hand and turns the

   staircase into ice. The thugs and the Duke fall.

   The crowd panics.

   A snowstorm begins. Elsa flees.

   Anna runs out of the palace doors, carrying the glove.

                            ANNA

                  Elsa!

   Hans follows closely behind her.

   GATES TO THE KINGDOM: Elsa runs out of the gates and down to

   the water's edge. The shoreline freezes under her feet.

   Anna calls to her from the gates.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)

                  Elsa! Wait, please!

   Elsa glances back at Anna, but turns away. She tentatively

   steps out onto the fjord. It freezes instantly. She breaks

   into a run, as the water freezes over with each step.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)

                  Elsa, stop!

   Anna rushes out onto the fjord ice, slips, falls.

                            HANS

                  Anna!

   Hans rushes to Anna's side.

   Elsa reaches the far shore. She doesn't look back. She just

   scrambles into the mountains.

                      (shocked)

                  Look.... The fjord.

   The ice spreads out until the entire fjord is frozen, locking

   the ships in place.

   INT. CASTLE COURTYARD -- NIGHT

   Snow falls. Hans and Anna move through the panicking crowd.

                            CROWD WALLAH

                  Snow? It's...snow...in July.

                              ANNA

                        (in shock)

                  No.

                            HANS

                  Did you know?

                              ANNA

                  No.

   Nearby, the Duke flutters about in fright.

                            DUKE

                  Look! It's snowing! It's snowing!

                  The Queen has cursed this land! She

                  must be stopped!

                      (to his thugs)

                  You have to go after her.

   Anna rushes up to the Duke.

                              ANNA

                  Wait, no!

   The Duke hides behind his thugs and points out at Anna.

                            DUKE

                  You! Is there sorcery in you, too?

                  Are you a monster, too?

                            ANNA

                  No. No. I'm completely ordinary.

                            HANS

                  That's right she is...

                      (realizing how that

                       sounds)

                  ...in the best way.

                            ANNA

                            DUKE

                  She nearly killed me.

                            HANS

                  You slipped on ice.

                  It was an accident. She was scared.

                  She didn't mean it. She didn't mean

                  any of this.... Tonight was my

                  fault. I pushed her. So I'm the one

                  that needs to go after her.

                            DUKE

                  Yes. Fine. Do.

                            HANS

                  What?

                      (to the Royal Handler)

                  Bring me my horse, please.

                            HANS

                  Anna, no. It's too dangerous.

                            ANNA

                  Elsa's not dangerous. I'll bring

                  her back, and I'll make this right.

   The Royal Handler brings Anna her horse and a cloak.

                            HANS

                  I'm coming with you.

                  No, I need you here to take care of

                  Arendelle.

   He sees the desperation in her eyes.

                            HANS

                  ...On my honor.

   She throws on the cloak and hops right onto the horse,

   coronation dress and all.

                            ANNA

                      (to the crowd)

                  I leave Prince Hans in charge!

                  Are you sure you can trust her? I

                  don't want you getting hurt.

                            ANNA

                  She's my sister; she would never

                  hurt me.

   She snaps the reins and rides out. Hans watches after her.

   The snow picks up and overtakes our view. We push through a

   blizzard...lose our way...then finds ourselves...

   EXT. HIGH UP IN THE MOUNTAINS -- NIGHT

   Well above the snow-line, a small figure climbs the highest

   peak. It's Elsa. Finally, she stops, looks around. Catches

   her breath and sings...

                                "Let It Go"

                            ELSA

                  THE SNOW GLOWS WHITE

                  ON THE MOUNTAIN TONIGHT,

                  NOT A FOOTPRINT TO BE SEEN.

                  A KINGDOM OF ISOLATION

                  AND IT LOOKS LIKE I'M THE QUEEN.

                  THE WIND IS HOWLING

                  LIKE THIS SWIRLING STORM INSIDE.

                  COULDN'T KEEP IT IN,

                  HEAVEN KNOWS I TRIED. . .

                  DON'T LET THEM IN,

                  DON'T LET THEM SEE,

                  BE THE GOOD GIRL YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO

                  BE.

                  CONCEAL,

                  DON'T FEEL,

                  DON'T LET THEM KNOW.

                  WELL, NOW THEY KNOW.

   Elsa takes off her glove and throws it into the air.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)

                  LET IT GO. LET IT GO.

                  CAN'T HOLD IT BACK ANYMORE.

   Elsa creates a snowman, just like the one she made with Anna

   when they were children.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)

                  LET IT GO. LET IT GO.

                  TURN AWAY AND SLAM THE DOOR.

                  SAY.

                  LET THE STORM RAGE ON.

                  THE COLD NEVER BOTHERED ME ANYWAY.

   Elsa lets her cape fly back into the wind.

                  IT'S FUNNY HOW SOME DISTANCE

                  MAKES EVERYTHING SEEM SMALL.

                  AND THE FEARS THAT ONCE CONTROLLED ME

                  CAN'T GET TO ME AT ALL.

                  IT'S TIME TO SEE

                  WHAT I CAN DO,

                  TO TEST THE LIMITS AND BREAK THROUGH.

                  NO RIGHT, NO WRONG,

                  NO RULES FOR ME...I'M FREE!

   Elsa creates ice steps and climbs them.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)

                  LET IT GO! LET IT GO!

                  I AM ONE WITH THE WIND AND SKY.

                  LET IT GO! LET IT GO!

                  YOU'LL NEVER SEE ME CRY.

                  HERE I STAND AND HERE I'LL STAY.

   Elsa slams her foot down and forms a giant snowflake.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)

                  LET THE STORM RAGE ON....

   In a flurry of creative release, she raises the snowflake on

   ice beams, builds walls, archways, a glistening chandelier,

   and an intricate ceiling that leaves the sky visible.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)

                  MY POWER FLURRIES THROUGH THE AIR

                  INTO THE GROUND.

                  MY SOUL IS SPIRALING IN FROZEN

                  FRACTALS ALL AROUND.

                  AND ONE THOUGHT CRYSTALLIZES LIKE

                  AN ICY BLAST-

   Standing firmly in her mighty ice palace, Elsa removes her

   crown and throws it.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)

                  I'M NEVER GOING BACK,

                  (back to resolve)

                  THE PAST IS IN THE PAST!

   She takes down her hair and creates a new dress made of ice.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)

                  LET IT GO! LET IT GO!

                  AND I'LL RISE LIKE THE BREAK OF DAWN.

                  LET IT GO! LET IT GO!

   The sun rises. Elsa struts onto out onto a balcony and into

   the light. She's free.

                                                                  38

                  HERE I STAND IN THE LIGHT OF DAY.

                  LET THE STORM RAGE ON!!

                  THE COLD NEVER BOTHERED ME ANYWAY.

   She turns and slams her ice palace door on us.

                                                           CUT TO:

   EXT. THE FJORD FOREST -- DAY

   Anna rides her horse through two feet of snow. She shivers.

                  Elsa! Elsa! It's me, Anna...your

                  freeze the summer. I'm sorry. It's

                  all my f-f-f-f-f-f-fault.

   LATER: Anna and the horse struggle through a wooded area.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)

                      (hearing a wolf howl)

                  Of course, none of this would have

                  happened if she'd just told me her

                  secret...ha...she's a stinker.

   A branch of a nearby tree snaps and startles the horse. Anna

   goes flying off, lands face down in the snow. She sits up.

   Spits out snow. Sees the horse running away.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)

                  Oh no. No. No. No. Come back. No.

                  No. No. No.... Oooo-kay.

   He doesn't come back. Anna grabs onto a branch of a leaning

   conifer, tries to pull herself to her feet, but the tree

   snaps upright and releases all its snow onto her. GROAN.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

   EXT. MOUNTAIN -- NIGHT

   The Northern Lights shine as Anna struggles, out of breath,

   reaching the top of a hill.

                  couldn't have had tr-tr-tropical

                  magic that covered the f-f-fjords

                  in white sand and warm --

   She sees smoke rising up in the distance.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)

                  Fire! WHOA!

   Anna goes tumbling down the hill. She lands with a crash in

   an icy stream at the bottom.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)

                      (from inside the snowball)

                  Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold...

   EXT. A SMALL BUILDING AND STABLE -- NIGHT

   Anna shuffles up to the building, her dress frozen stiff. She

   shakes the snow off a sign and reads:

                            ANNA

                  Wandering Oaken's Trading Post.

   Snow drops off a smaller sign. She reads it, happily.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)

                  Ooh! And Sauna...

   INT. WANDERING OAKEN'S TRADING POST & SAUNA -- NIGHT

   Anna steps cautiously through the door--which hits her frozen

   butt and knocks her into the center of the shop. She looks

   around, sees only summer supplies.

                             OAKEN (O.S.)

                  Hoo hoo.

   Anna turns to see a bright-faced fellow sitting low behind

   the counter, fingers tapping tip to tip.

                            OAKEN (CONT'D)

                  Big summer blow out. Half off

                  swimming suits, clogs, and a sun

                  That would be in our winter

                  department.

   The winter department contains one outfit, a pick ax, and a

   lonely pair of boots.

                            ANNA

                  Oh. Um, I was just wondering; has

                  another young woman, the Queen

                  perhaps, I don't know, passed

                  through here?

   She brings the clothes and boots to the counter.

                            OAKEN

                  Only one crazy enough to be out in

                  this storm is you, dear?

   The front door suddenly blows open and in walks a mass of a

   man covered in ice. Underneath is KRISTOFF.

                            OAKEN (CONT'D)

                  You and this fellow.... Hoo hoo.

                  Big summer blow out.

   Kristoff walks right up to Anna.

                            KRISTOFF

                      (in her face)

                  Carrots.

                            ANNA

                  Huh?

                            KRISTOFF

                  Behind you.

                            ANNA

                  Oh, right. Excuse me.

   Anna moves out of Kristoff's way. He grabs a bunch of

   carrots, tosses them on the counter, then moves through the

   place, gathering other supplies.

                            OAKEN

   Kristoff brings his supplies to the counter. Oaken counts on

   his fingertips.

                            OAKEN

                  That'll be forty.

                            KRISTOFF

                  Forty? No, ten.

                            OAKEN

                      (sweet as pie)

                  Oh dear, that's no good. See these

                  are from our winter stock, where

                  supply and demand have a big

                  problem.

                            KRISTOFF

                  You want to talk about a supply and

                  demand problem? I sell ice for a

                  living.

   Kristoff motions out the window, where we see the blocks of

   ice on his sled, covered in snow.

                            ANNA

                  Ooh, that's a rough business to be

                  in right now. I mean, that is

                  really...

                      (he shoots her a look)

                  Ahem. That's unfortunate.

                            OAKEN

                  Still forty. But I will throw in a

                  visit to Oaken's sauna. Hoo hoo!

                  Hi, family.

   Kristoff and Anna turn to see a naked family waving through

   the window of the steaming sauna.

                             NAKED FAMILY

                  Hoo hoo!

                            KRISTOFF

                  ...Ten's all I got. Help me out.

                            OAKEN

                      (isolating the carrots)

                  Ten will get you this and no more.

   Kristoff seethes. Stalemate.

                                                               42

FROZEN - J. Lee

                            ANNA

                  Okay, just tell me one thing; what

                  was happening on the North

                  Mountain? Did it seem magical?

   Kristoff pulls down his scarf and gives Anna a firm answer.

                            KRISTOFF

                  Yes! Now, back up while I deal with

                  this crook here.

   Oaken stands up, revealing his seven-foot stature.

                            OAKEN

                  What did you call me?

   EXT. WANDERING OAKEN'S TRADING POST AND SAUNA -- NIGHT

   Oaken stomps out the door, carrying Kristoff with one arm.

                            KRISTOFF

                  Okay. Okay, I'm- Ow! Whoa!

   Oaken throws Kristoff, who face-plants in the snow.

                             OAKEN

                  Bye bye.

   Oaken slams the door. Kristoff sits up. His reindeer, Sven,

   canters over, snorts, and nudges him, expectantly.

                            KRISTOFF

                  No Sven, I didn't get your carrots.

   Sven huffs in his face. Kristoff turns away and sees

   something. He points to a dilapidated barn.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

                  But I did find us a place to sleep.

                  And it's free.

   INT. WANDERING OAKEN'S TRADING POST AND SAUNA -- NIGHT

   Anna stands watching Oaken and all his great height as he

   squeezes behind the counter and sits down low again.

                            OAKEN

                      (teddy bear)

                  I'm sorry about this violence. I

                  will add a quart of lutefisk, so

                  we'll have good feelings. Just the

                  outfit and boots, yah?

                                                                 43

FROZEN - J. Lee

   Anna looks between Kristoff's supplies and the door.

                                                           CUT TO:

   INT. OAKEN'S STABLES - NIGHT

   Kristoff, now unfrozen, relaxes on a bed of hay, playing his

   lute and singing to (and for) Sven.

                    "Reindeer(s) are Better than People"

                            KRISTOFF

                  REINDEERS ARE BETTER THAN PEOPLE.

                  SVEN, DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S TRUE?

                             KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D)

                      (throwing his voice)

                  YEAH, PEOPLE WILL BEAT YOU & CURSE

                  YOU & CHEAT YOU.

                  EVERY ONE OF EM'S BAD, EXCEPT YOU.

                      (speaking)

                  Oh, thanks, Buddy.

                      (singing, as Kristoff)

                  BUT PEOPLE SMELL BETTER THAN

                  REINDEERS.

                  SVEN, DON'T YOU THINK I'M RIGHT?

                      (As Sven)

                  THAT'S ONCE AGAIN TRUE,

                  FOR ALL EXCEPT YOU.

                      (As Kristoff)

                  YOU GOT ME. LET'S CALL IT A NIGHT.

                      (As Sven)

                  GOOD NIGHT.

                      (As Kristoff)

                  DON'T LET THE FROSTBITE BITE.

   The door opens. Anna enters.

                               ANNA

                  Nice duet.

   Kristoff sits up with a start...sees who it is.

                            KRISTOFF

                  Oh, it's just you. What do you

                  want?

                            ANNA

                  I want you to take me up the North

                  Mountain.

                                                                   44

FROZEN - J. Lee

                            KRISTOFF

                  I don't take people places.

   He lays back down, closes his eyes.

                            ANNA

                  Let me rephrase that...

   A sack of supplies lands in Kristoff's lap.

                            KRISTOFF

                  Umph.

   He sits up. Looks in the bag.

                            ANNA

                  Take me up the North Mountain....

                  Please.

   He eyes her. He clearly doesn't take orders.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)

                  Look, I know how to stop this

                  winter.

   He considers, lies back down, pulls his hat over his eyes.

                            KRISTOFF

                  We leave at dawn.... And you forgot

                  the carrots for Sven.

   A bag of carrots hits Kristoff in the face.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

                  Ugh!

                            ANNA

                  Oops. Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. I

                  didn't--

                      (catching herself)

                  We leave now. Right now.

   She steps back outside and waits, anxiously. Annoyed,

   Kristoff offers Sven a carrot. Sven has a bite. Then Kristoff

   has a bite, contemplating.

                                                        SLAM CUT TO:

   EXT. MOUNTAIN HIGH -- NIGHT

   Sven races, top speed, up a narrow cliff, pulling the sled,

   which skids precariously. Kristoff mans the reins. Anna sits

   beside him.

                                                            45

FROZEN - J. Lee

                            KRISTOFF

                      (trying to scare Anna)

                  Hang on! We like to go fast!

                            ANNA

                      (fearless)

                  I like fast!

   Anna leans back and puts her feet up on the dashboard.

                            KRISTOFF

                  Whoa, whoa! Get your feet down.

   He pushes her feet down.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

                  This is fresh lacquer. Seriously,

                  were you raised in a barn?

   Kristoff spits on the dash to clean it. The spit flies back

   and hits Anna in the face.

                            ANNA

                      (grossed out)

                  Ew. No, I was raised in a castle.

   She wipes off her face.

                            KRISTOFF

                  So tell me, what made the Queen go

                  all ice-crazy?

                            ANNA

                  ...Oh well, it was all my fault. I

                  got engaged but then she freaked

                  out because I'd only just met him,

                  you know, that day. And she said

                  she wouldn't bless the marriage--

                            KRISTOFF

                  Wait. You got engaged to someone

                  you just met?

                            ANNA

                  Yeah. Anyway, I got mad and so she

                  got mad and then she tried to walk

                  away, and I grabbed her glove--

                            KRISTOFF

                  Hang on. You mean to tell me you

                  got engaged to someone you just

                  met?!

                                                            46

FROZEN - J. Lee

                            ANNA

                  Yes. Pay attention. But the thing

                  is she wore the gloves all the

                  time, so I just thought, maybe she

                  has a thing about dirt.

                            KRISTOFF

                  Didn't your parents ever warn you

                  about strangers?

   Anna eyes Kristoff up and down, then slides away from him.

                            ANNA

                  Yes, they did.... But Hans is not a

                  stranger.

                            KRISTOFF

                  Oh yeah? What's his last name?

                            ANNA

                  ...Of-the-Southern-Isles?

                            KRISTOFF

                  What's his favorite food?

                            ANNA

                  ...Sandwiches.

                            KRISTOFF

                  Best friend's name?

                            ANNA

                  Probably John.

                               KRISTOFF

                  Eye color.

                               ANNA

                  Dreamy.

                            KRISTOFF

                  Foot size...?

                            ANNA

                  Foot size doesn't matter.

                            KRISTOFF

                  Have you had a meal with him yet?

                  What if you hate the way he eats?

                  What if you hate the way he picks

                  his nose?

                            ANNA

                  Picks his nose?

                                                            47

FROZEN - J. Lee

                            KRISTOFF

                  And eats it.

                            ANNA

                  Excuse me, sir. He's a prince.

                            KRISTOFF

                  All men do it.

                             ANNA

                  Ew. Look it doesn't matter; it's

                  true love.

                            KRISTOFF

                  Doesn't sound like true love.

                            ANNA

                  Are you some sort of love expert?

                            KRISTOFF

                  No. But I have friends who are.

                            ANNA

                  You have friends who are love

                  experts.... I'm not buying it.

   Sven suddenly stops, ears perked in alarm.

                            KRISTOFF

                      (to Anna)

                  Stop talking.

                            ANNA

                  No, no, no. I'd like to meet these--

   Kristoff clamps his hand over Anna's mouth.

                            KRISTOFF

                  I mean it. SHHH.

   Kristoff stands, looks into the dark woods surrounding them.

   Sensing something behind them, he holds up his lantern. Its

   light reflects off...EYES. Several.

                            KRISTOFF(CONT'D)

                  Sven, go. Go!

   Sven takes off.

                            ANNA

                  What are they?

                            KRISTOFF

                  Wolves.

                                                              48

   Flashes of white dart through the woods. Kristoff hops into

   the back of the sled, grabs a torch. Lights it.

                            ANNA

                  Wolves. What do we do?

                            KRISTOFF

                  I've got this. You just...don't

                  fall off and don't get eaten.

                            ANNA

                  But I wanna help.

                             KRISTOFF

                  No.

                             ANNA

                  Why not?

                             KRISTOFF

                  Because I don't trust your

                  judgement.

                            ANNA

                  Excuse me?!

   A wolf jumps at them, but Kristoff kicks it off.

                            KRISTOFF

                  Who marries a man she just met?

   Anna grabs the lute, swings it right at Kristoff's head.

                            ANNA

                  It's true love!

   He screams, as she...BAM!...swings past Kristoff and knocks a

   wolf away.

                            KRISTOFF

                      (shocked)

                  Whoa.

   Just then Kristoff is yanked off the sled by another wolf.

   The torch goes flying. Anna catches it, shocked.

                            ANNA

                  Christopher!

   Kristoff grabs onto a loose rope hanging from the back of the

   sled and holds on for dear life as he's dragged behind.

                            KRISTOFF

                  It's Kristoff!

                                                               49

   A wolf jumps on Kristoff's back.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

                  AH!

   Anna thinks fast, uses the torch to light a blanket on fire.

                            ANNA

                  Duck!

   Anna throws the flaming blanket right at him. He ducks. The

   blanket hits the wolves. They tumble off Kristoff.

                            KRISTOFF

                  You almost set me on fire!

   Anna reaches out a hand, pulls Kristoff back onto the sled.

                            ANNA

                  But I didn't.

   Sven cries out. There is a massive gorge ahead.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)

                  Get ready to jump, Sven!

                            KRISTOFF

                  You don't tell him what to do!

   Kristoff shoves a satchel into her arms then scoops her up.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

                  I do!

   Kristoff tosses Anna onto Sven, then unhooks Sven's harness

   from the sled.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

                  Jump, Sven!

   Sven jumps the gorge with Anna on his back.

   Kristoff goes flying off behind them, still on the sled.

   Anna and Sven land safely on the other side of the gorge.

   Kristoff's sled loses momentum. It's not going to make it. He

   leaps off. He flaps his arms, claws at the air.

   He slams into the snowy edge of the cliff. Hanging by his

   hands, he looks down to see his sled hit the ground far below

   and burst into flames.

                                                            50

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

                      (shocked sadness)

                  ...But I just paid it off.

   Suddenly, he starts to slip. He claws at the loose snow, but

   it's clearly hopeless. He's going down.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

                  Uh-oh. No, no, no.

   To make matters worse, an AXE comes flying right at his face.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

                  AH! NO, NO, NO!

   The axe slams into the snow, inches from his nose.

                             ANNA (O.S.)

                  Grab on!

   Kristoff grabs on.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)

                  Pull, Sven! Pull!

   REVEAL: The axe is tied to a rope, then wrapped around Sven.

   Anna helps Sven pull Kristoff to safety.

   Kristoff rolls onto his back, exhausted. Anna peeks down at

   the burning sled.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)

                  Whoa.... I'll replace your sled and

                  everything in it.

   Kristoff groans.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)

                  And I understand if you don't want

                  to help me anymore.

   Anna walks off, sadly. Sven comes over and nuzzles Kristoff.

                            KRISTOFF

                  Of course I don't want to help her

                  anymore. In fact, this whole thing

                  has ruined me for helping anyone

                  ever again.

                            KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D)

                  But she'll die on her own.

                            KRISTOFF (AS SELF) (CONT'D)

                  I can live with that.

                                                                51

FROZEN - J. Lee

   Through their conversation, they watch Anna go the wrong

   way...turn, go the other wrong way, turn, trip...

                            KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D)

                  But you won't get your new sled if

                  she's dead.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

                      (knowing he's got a point)

                  ...You know sometimes I really

                  don't like you.

   Sven licks Kristoff happily.

                            KRISTOFF (AS SELF) (CONT'D)

                      (to Anna)

                  Hold up. We're coming?!

                  You are?!

                      (catching herself)

                  I mean, sure. I'll let you tag

                  along.

   Kristoff, Sven and Anna walk on a narrow rim of a mountain.

   EXT. MOUNTAIN FOREST CLEARING -- DAY

   As they step out of the thick trees, Anna catches sight of

   something far below.

                               ANNA

                  Arendelle.

                            KRISTOFF

                  It's completely frozen.

                            ANNA

                  ...But it'll be fine. Elsa will

                  thaw it.

                               KRISTOFF

                  Will she?

                                                                 52

                  ...Yeah. Now come on. This way to

                  the North Mountain?

   She points straight ahead.

                            KRISTOFF

                  More like this way.

   He points her finger up towards a perilously mighty mountain.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

   INT. FROZEN WILLOW TREES -- DAY

   Anna, Kristoff, and Sven walk beneath frozen willows. The

   hanging branches glisten like Christmas lights. Sven knocks

   them with his antlers. They tinkle like chimes.

                             ANNA

                  I never knew winter could be so

                  beautiful.

   Suddenly, a voice comes in from nowhere. We'll call that

   voice OLAF.

                            OLAF (O.S.)

                  YEAH...It really is beautiful,

                  isn't it? But it's so white. You

                  know, how about a little color?

                  Must we bleach the joy out of it

                  all? I'm thinking like maybe some

                  crimson, chartreuse...

   While this is going on, Anna and Kristoff look around for the

   source of the rambling. They look at Sven - could he actually

   be talking? Sven looks back at them, his antlers tangled in

   branches, just as baffled as they are.

   In the meantime, a nose-less snowman, Olaf, wanders up behind

   them.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)

                  How `bout yellow--no, not yellow.

                  Yellow and snow? Brrrr...no go.

   He stops between Kristoff and Anna. They look down at him.

   How did he get there? He suddenly looks up at Anna.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)

                  Am I right?

                                                               53

FROZEN - J. Lee

   Anna SCREAMS! Reflexes take over and she kicks Olaf's head,

   sending it flying off his body and into Kristoff's arms.

                              OLAF (CONT'D)

                        (cheery, to Kristoff)

                  Hi!

                            KRISTOFF

                  You're creepy.

   Kristoff tosses the head back to Anna and they commence a

   game of hot potato.

                            ANNA

                  I don't want it!

                            KRISTOFF

                  Backatchya!

                            OLAF

                  Please don't drop me.

                              ANNA

                  Don't!

                            KRISTOFF

                  Come on, it's just a head.

                              ANNA

                  No!

   Olaf's body runs at Anna, arms waving.

                            OLAF (O.S.)

                  All right, we got off to a bad

                  start.

                            ANNA

                  Ew, ew, the body!

   Anna slams Olaf's head back on the body, upside down. Olaf

   smiles happily, then looks confused.

                            OLAF

                  Wait, what am I looking at right

                  now? Why are you hanging off the

                  earth like a bat?

                            ANNA

                      (sympathetic)

                  ...Okay. Wait one second.

   Anna kneels in front of Olaf and rights his head.

                                                               54

                  Oooh! Thank you!

                            ANNA

                  You're welcome.

                            OLAF

                  Now I'm perfect.

   She looks over his innocent face, gets an idea.

                            ANNA

                  Well, almost.

   She digs into Kristoff's satchel, holds up a carrot just as

   Olaf turns toward her. The carrot accidentally slams all the

   way through his head.

                            OLAF

                  Woo! Head rush!

                            ANNA

                  Oh! Too hard. I'm sorry! I-I, I was

                  just.... Are you okay?

   Olaf sees a tiny piece of carrot sticking out between his

   eyes. He lights up.

                            OLAF

                  Are you kidding me? I am wonderful!

                  I've always wanted a nose.

                      (going cross-eyed to look

                       at his tiny nose)

                  So cute. It's like a little baby

                  unicorn.

   Anna reaches behind Olaf to the bulk of the carrot sticking

   out the back of his head, and pushes it forward.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)

                  What? Hey! Whoa.

                      (seeing his now big nose)

                  Oh, I love it even more! Hah....

                  All right, let's start this thing

                  over. Hi everyone. I'm Olaf. And I

                  like warm hugs.

   Olaf opens his arms wide to Anna. That triggers a memory. It

   takes her a moment to place it, but then she does.

                            ANNA

                  Olaf?...That's right, Olaf.

                            ANNA

                  Oh, um...I'm Anna.

                            OLAF

                  And who's the funky-looking donkey

                  over there?

                            ANNA

                  That's Sven.

                            OLAF

                  Uh-huh. And who's the reindeer?

                               ANNA

                  ...Sven.

   Olaf looks from Kristoff to Sven, confused.

                            OLAF

                  Oh. They're--oh, okay....

                      (accepting it)

                  Makes things easier for me.

   Sven tries to bite Olaf's nose.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)

                  Ha. Aw, look at him tryin' to kiss

                  my nose.

                      (gushes)

                  I like you, too!

                            ANNA

                  Olaf, did Elsa build you?

                               OLAF

                  Yeah. Why?

   Curious, Kristoff takes one of Olaf's twig arms off, studies

   it. It seems to be moving in sync with his other arm.

                            ANNA

                  Do you know where she is?

                            KRISTOFF

                      (studying the arm)

                  Fascinating...

                               OLAF

                  Yeah. Why?

                                                                   56

                  way?

                               OLAF

                  Yeah. Why?

                            KRISTOFF

                      (bending the arm)

                  How does this work?

   Olaf's dismembered arm slaps Kristoff across the face.

                             OLAF

                  Stop it, Sven. Trying to focus

                  here.

                      (to Anna)

                  Yeah, why?

                            KRISTOFF

                  I'll tell you why. We need Elsa to

                  bring back summer.

                      (shocked)

                  Summer?

                      (sinking into wistfulness)

                  Oh, I don't know why but I've

                  always loved the idea of summer,

                  and sun, and all things hot.

                            KRISTOFF

                  Really? I'm guessing you don't have

                  much experience with heat.

                            OLAF

                  Nope. But sometimes I like to close

                  my eyes and imagine what it'd be

                  like when summer does come.

   He stops at a puddle, looks down at it. Smiles. Hops over it.

                               OLAF

                  IN SUMMER!

   Olaf sings the final note. We swing around him and return to:

   REALITY. He then straightens up and smiles.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)

                  So, come on! Elsa's this way. Let's

   Olaf grabs Anna's hand and pulls her along up the mountain.

                      (laughing)

   Sven hops along, happily following them. Kristoff watches all

   of them like they're nuts.

   EXT. ARENDELLE, VILLAGE -- DAY

   A layer of solid ice coats everything. People huddle around

   weak fires. Anxiety runs high amongst the villagers and

   guests. We pass two CITIZENS fighting over a woodpile.

                            CITIZEN ONE

                  No. No. You've got the bark facing

                  down. The bark needs to be face-up.

                            CITIZEN TWO

                  Bark down is drier.

                               CITIZEN ONE

                  Bark up.

   Like a light in the dark, Hans moves through the crowd.

                            HANS

                  Cloak. Does anyone need a cloak?

                            GERDA

                  Arendelle is indebted to you, Your

                  Highness.

                            HANS

                  The castle is open. There's soup

                  and hot glogg in the Great Hall.

   He hands the stack of cloaks to a guard.

                            HANS (CONT'D)

                  Here. Pass these out.

   Just then the Duke approaches Hans.

                            DUKE

                  Prince Hans, are we just expected

                  to sit here and freeze while you

                  give away all of Arendelle's

                  Princess Anna has given her orders

                  dawned on you that your princess

                  may be conspiring with a wicked

                  sorceress to destroy us all?

   Hans's nice eyes turn to threatening slits.

                            HANS

                  Do not question the Princess. She

                  left me in charge, and I will not

                  hesitate to protect Arendelle from

                  treason.

                            DUKE

                      (flabbergasted, offended)

                  Treason?!

   Suddenly they hear the alarmed whinny of Anna's horse. It

   returns alone, bucking and kicking. Hans grabs its reins.

                            HANS

                  Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, boy. Easy. Easy.

                      (various)

                  Princess Anna's horse. What

                  happened to her? Where is she?

   Hans steadies the horse, looks up at the mountain. He sees

   all the panicked faces of the kingdom looking to him.

                            HANS

                  ...Princess Anna is in trouble.

                  I need volunteers to go with me to

                  find her!

   Volunteers, some from Arendelle, some from other lands, rush

   up to offer their services.

                            DUKE

                  I volunteer two men, my Lord!

                  should you encounter the Queen, you

   His two thugs sneer.

   EXT. THE NORTH MOUNTAIN -- DAY

   Anna, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf move through hostile terrain.

   Wind-swept icicles face horizontal.

                            KRISTOFF

                  So how exactly are you planning to

                  Oh, I am gonna talk to my sister.

                  That's your plan? My ice business

                  is riding on you talking to your

                  sister.

                              ANNA

                  Yup.

   Kristoff, so stunned by her casual plan, doesn't look where

   he's going and ends up with an ice-spike to the nose. He

   stops short, GULP, moves carefully around the spike.

                            KRISTOFF

                  So you're not at all afraid of her?

                            ANNA

                  Yeah. I bet Elsa's the nicest,

   Olaf backs right into an icicle. It runs through his torso.

                  Oh, look at that. I've been

   Anna and Kristoff hit what looks like a dead end. The face of

   Kristoff looks around, sighs. Digs in his rucksack.

                            KRISTOFF

                  ...It's too steep. I've only got

                  one rope, and you don't know how to

                  climb mountains.

                              ANNA (O.S.)

                  Says who?

   Sven nudges Kristoff, who looks up to see Anna trying to

   climb the cliff's flat face.

   Kristoff watches her searching for footholds and hand-holds.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

                  I wouldn't put my foot there.

                  You're distracting me.

                            KRISTOFF

                  Or there. How do you know Elsa even

                  wants to see you?

                  gotta concentrate here.

                            KRISTOFF

                  You know, most people who disappear

                  into the mountains want to be

                  alone.

                            ANNA (O.S.)

                  Nobody wants to be alone. Except

   Anna kicks a foot above her head to catch a foot hold.

                  ...Please tell me I'm almost there.

   REVEAL: she's only about six feet up. Her muscles shake.

                  ...Does the air seem a bit thin to

   Kristoff smiles, getting a kick out of her.

                             KRISTOFF

                  Hang on.

   He pulls the rope from his bag. Just then Olaf steps out from

   behind a rock and waves to Kristoff.

                            OLAF

                  Hey, Sven? Not sure if this is

                  going to solve the problem, but I

                  found a staircase that leads

                  exactly where you want it to go.

                            ANNA

                  Ha ha. Thank goodness. Catch!

   Anna drops off the cliff. Kristoff catches her.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)

                  Thanks! That was like a crazy trust

                  exercise.

   She hops down, brushes off her dress, and bounds off.

   Kristoff watches after her, digging her fearless pluck.

   EXT. BASE OF THE ICE PALACE -- DAY

   Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf approach Elsa's elegant ice palace.

                  Go ahead. I won't judge.

   Anna climbs the steps with Olaf. Sven tries to follow. His

   hooves slip out. He scrambles but can't get traction.

   Kristoff runs to his aide.

                            KRISTOFF

                  All right, take it easy. I gotcha.

   Kristoff settles Sven back down the stairs and pats him.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

                  You stay right here, buddy.

   Sven obediently plops his reindeer butt down and wags his

   tail. Kristoff climbs the stairs, admiring the ice details.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

                  ...Flawless.

   Anna arrives at the door. Hesitates.

                            OLAF

                  ...Knock....

                      (she doesn't)

                  Why isn't she knocking...? Do you

                  think she knows how to knock?

   Anna finally KNOCKS. The sound echoes inside. The ice doors

   slide open.

                            ANNA

                  Ha. It opened. That's a first.

   Anna goes to step in. Kristoff follows. She gets a thought,

   stops him.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)

                  You should probably wait out here.

   Olaf starts to head inside. Anna stops him.

                            ANNA

                  You too, Olaf.

                               OLAF

                  Me?

                            ANNA

                  Just give us a minute.

                               OLAF

                  Okay.

   As Anna walks inside. Olaf starts counting.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)

                  One...two...

   Kristoff joins in.

                            OLAF AND KRISTOFF

                  Three...four...

   INT. ELSA'S PALACE -- DAY

   Anna walks into a great foyer. The place is beautiful, but

   also eerie.

                            ANNA

                  Elsa? It's me...Anna?!

   Anna slips. Steadies herself.

                               ELSA (O.S.)

                  Anna.

   Elsa steps out of the shadows onto a balcony. She sees Anna,

   looks to her longingly.

   Anna can't help but be struck by Elsa's beauty.

                            ANNA

                  Elsa, you look different.... It's a

                  good different.... And this place

                  is amazing.

                                                            66

FROZEN - J. Lee

                            ELSA

                      (cautious, polite)

                  Thank you, I never knew what I was

                  capable of.

   Anna starts to climb the stairs.

                            ANNA

                  ...I'm so sorry about what

                  happened. If I'd known--

   Elsa backs up, away from Anna.

                            ELSA

                      (on guard)

                  No, it's okay. You don't have to

                  apologize.... But you should

                  probably go, please.

                            ANNA

                  But I just got here.

                            ELSA

                  ...You belong in Arendelle.

                               ANNA

                  So do you.

   Anna takes another step up. Elsa backs up more.

                            ELSA

                  No, I belong here. Alone. Where I

                  can be who I am without hurting

                  anybody.

                            ANNA

                  ...Actually, about that--

                            OLAF (O.S.)

                  58...59...60.

                            ELSA

                  Wait. What is that?

   Olaf comes running in the front door. He waves.

                            OLAF

                  Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs.

                            ELSA

                      (shocked)

                  Olaf?

   Olaf stops beside Anna, looks up at Elsa, intimidated.

                                                                   67

FROZEN - J. Lee

                            OLAF

                      (bashful)

                  You built me. You remember that?

                            ELSA

                      (astonished)

                  And you're alive?

                            OLAF

                  Um...I think so?

   Anna kneels down beside Olaf.

                            ANNA

                  He's just like the one we built as

                  kids.... We were so close. We can

                  be like that again.

   Elsa smiles, but then a memory returns to her.

                                                       FLASH CUT TO:

   FLASHBACK: Young Anna is struck by Elsa's powers.

                            YOUNG ELSA

                  Anna!

   Young Anna falls unconscious. Young Elsa races to her.

                                                       FLASH CUT TO:

   THE PRESENT: Elsa's face sinks in pain.

                            ELSA

                  No, we can't.

   Elsa turns and heads up the second story steps.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)

                  Goodbye, Anna.

                            ANNA

                  Elsa, wait--

                            ELSA

                      (calling back)

                  I'm just trying to protect you.

   Elsa continues to flee. Anna pursues.

                             ANNA

                  You don't have to protect me. I'm

                  not afraid. Please don't shut me

                  out again.

                                                            68

FROZEN - J. Lee

   Anna SINGS.

                      "First Time in Forever, Reprise"

                            ANNA (CONT'D)

                  PLEASE DON'T SLAM THE DOOR.

                  YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP YOUR

                  DISTANCE ANYMORE.

                  I FINALLY UNDERSTAND.

                  FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,

                  WE CAN FIX THIS HAND IN HAND.

                  WE CAN HEAD DOWN THIS MOUNTAIN

                  TOGETHER.

                  YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIVE IN FEAR.

                  `CAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN

                  FOREVER,

                  I WILL BE RIGHT HERE.

   They arrive on the top floor, Elsa's main living space. Elsa

   turns back to Anna, grateful, but determined.

                            ELSA

                  Anna,

                  PLEASE GO BACK HOME.

                  YOUR LIFE AWAITS.

                  GO ENJOY THE SUN

                  AND OPEN UP THE GATES.

                            ANNA

                  Yeah, but--

                            ELSA

                  I know!

                  YOU MEAN WELL,

                  BUT LEAVE ME BE.

                  YES, I'M ALONE BUT I'M ALONE AND

                  FREE.

   Elsa opens up the balcony doors.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)

                  JUST STAY AWAY AND YOU'LL BE SAFE

                  FROM ME.

                            ANNA

                  ACTUALLY, WE'RE NOT.

                            ELSA

                  WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU'RE NOT?

                                                            69

FROZEN - J. Lee

                            ANNA

                  I GET THE FEELING YOU DON'T KNOW?

                            ELSA

                  WHAT DO I NOT KNOW?

                            ANNA

                  ARENDELLE'S IN DEEP DEEP DEEP DEEP

                  SNOW.

                            ELSA

                  What?

   Elsa looks past Anna's shoulder out white-peaked mountains.

                            ANNA

                  You kind of set off an eternal

                  winter...everywhere.

                            ELSA

                  Everywhere?

                            ANNA

                  It's okay, you can just unfreeze

                  it.

                            ELSA

                  No, I can't. I don't know how.

                            ANNA

                  Sure you can. I know you can.

   Snow starts to swirl around the room.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)

                  CUZ FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,

                            ELSA

                      (panicking)

                  I'M SUCH A FOOL!

                  I CAN'T BE FREE!

                            ANNA

                  YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID.

                            ELSA

                  NO ESCAPE

                  FROM THE STORM INSIDE OF ME!

   The snow picks up. Anna tries to fight through it.

                            ANNA

                  WE CAN WORK THIS OUT TOGETHER.

                                                               70

FROZEN - J. Lee

                            ELSA

                  I CAN'T CONTROL THE CURSE!

                            ANNA

                  WE'LL REVERSE THE STORM YOU'VE

                  MADE.

                            ELSA

                  ANNA, PLEASE, YOU'LL ONLY MAKE IT

                  WORSE!

                            ANNA

                  DON'T PANIC.

                            ELSA

                  THERE'S SO MUCH FEAR!

                            ANNA

                  WE'LL MAKE THE SUN SHINE BRIGHT.

                            ELSA

                  YOU'RE NOT SAFE HERE!

                            ANNA

                  WE CAN FACE THIS THING TOGETHER...

   But as Anna sings, we lose sight of her in the thickening

   blizzard taking over the room.

                             ELSA

                  NO!

                            ANNA (O.S.)

                  WE CAN CHANGE THIS WINTER WEATHER,

                  AND EVERYTHING WILL BE...

   Anna's voice disappears in the storm as Elsa cries out.

                             ELSA

                  I CAN'T!

   Elsa's fear, so strong, sucks the blizzard back into her and

   then it bursts out, unwittingly, like a sharp snowflake.

   Anna is STRUCK right in the heart. She grasps her chest in

   pain and stumbles back. She falls to her knees.

   Elsa gasps when she sees Anna. Just then, Olaf and Kristoff

   rush into the room to Anna's side.

                            KRISTOFF

                  Anna. Are you okay?

                                                                   71

FROZEN - J. Lee

                            ANNA

                  I'm okay.... I'm fine.

   Anna gets to her feet, determined to hide the pain.

                            ELSA

                      (scared)

                  Who's this? Wait, it doesn't

                  matter. You have to go.

                             ANNA

                  No, I know we can figure this out

                  together--

                            ELSA

                      (desperate)

                  How? What power do you have to stop

                  this winter? To stop me?

   Anna doesn't have the answer. Kristoff sees spiky ice shadows

   creeping down the walls. Puts a protective arm around Anna.

                            KRISTOFF

                  Anna, I think we should go.

                            ANNA

                      (close to tears)

                  No. I'm not leaving without you,

                  Elsa.

                            ELSA

                      (heartbroken but decisive)

                  Yes, you are.

   Elsa waves her arms and builds a giant, menacing snowman.

   We'll call him MARSHMALLOW.

                                                        SLAM CUT TO:

   EXT. ICE PALACE -- DAY

   Marshmallow holds Anna and Kristoff by the scruff of their

   necks in one hand and Olaf in the other.

                            ANNA

                  Stop. Put us down!

                            OLAF

                      (to Marshmallow)

                  You are a lot stronger than I think

                  you realize.

   Marshmallow tosses Kristoff and Anna down the steps.

                                                                    72

FROZEN - J. Lee

                            MARSHMALLOW

                      (like a bouncer)

                  Go away!

   Anna and Kistoff slide past Sven, who's got his tongue stuck

   to the ice railing.

                              OLAF (O.S.)

                  Heads up!

   Olaf's head smashes into a snowbank nearby.

                              ANNA

                  Olaf!

                            OLAF

                  Watch out for my butt!

   Anna and Kristoff duck as the rest of Olaf slams into the

   snowbank.

   Marshmallow turns to go back into the castle.

   Incensed, Anna tries to march back up the stairs.

                            ANNA

                  It is not nice to throw people!

   Kristoff grabs her, pulls her back.

              KRISTOFF                                   ANNA

   All right feisty pants. Calm             Let me at him. I want to get

   down. Woaw. Just let the snow            him. I.... Okay. I'm Calm.

   man be.

   Anna backs down...for a moment. Then she grabs a snowball and

   throws it at Marshmallow.

   The tiny little ball hits Marshmallow's back, not making even

   the slightest dent. But it's enough to infuriate him. He

   ROARS. Spikes shoot out of his joints.

                            KRISTOFF

                  Uh-oh. Now you made him mad!

                            OLAF

                  ...I'll distract him. You guys go.

   Kristoff pushes Anna along. Sven runs off in the opposite

   direction. Olaf's belly and butt fall and follow Sven.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)

                  No, no, not you guys.

                                                               73

FROZEN - J. Lee

   Marshmallow goes charging after Anna and Kristoff as Olaf's

   head falls and lands face down in snow.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)

                      (muffled)

                  This just got a whole lot harder.

   Anna and Kristoff leap and slide down a steep slope. They

   tumble to a stop at the bottom just as Marshmallow lands hard

   right behind them.

   They're off again...through a maze of conifers that sag under

   the weight of the snow, Marshmallow hot on their trail.

                               KRISTOFF

                  This way!

   Anna grabs a branch of a sagging trees and releases all of

   the snow. The tree snaps upright, knocking Marshmallow back.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

                      (impressed)

                  Ho-ho-ho!

                               ANNA

                  I got him!

   Anna and Kristoff burst out of the conifer forest and almost

   run right off a cliff. They stop short, toes on the edge.

                            KRISTOFF

                  Whoa, stop!

                            ANNA

                  It's a hundred foot drop.

                            KRISTOFF

                  It's two hundred.

   Kristoff ties the rope around Anna and pulls tight.

                               ANNA

                  Ow.

   He drops to his knees and starts digging a u-shape in the

   snow with a pick axe.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)

                  What's that for?

                            KRISTOFF

                  I'm digging a snow anchor.

                                                            74

FROZEN - J. Lee

                            ANNA

                      (not trusting)

                  Okay. What if we fall?

                            KRISTOFF

                  There's twenty feet of fresh powder

                  down there; it'll be like landing

                  on a pillow.... Hopefully.

   They hear an angry ROAR coming closer.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

                  Okay, Anna. On three.

   Anna preps for the jump like a boxer getting ready to fight.

                            ANNA

                  Okay. You tell me when...

                               KRISTOFF

                  One...

                            ANNA

                  ...I'm ready to go....

                               KRISTOFF

                  Two...

                            ANNA

                      (pumped up)

                  ...I was BORN ready! Yes!

                               KRISTOFF

                  Calm down.

   A huge tree flies through the air toward them.

                               ANNA (O.S.)

                  TREE!

   Anna jumps and pulls Kristoff over the edge with her. They

   hang upside down over the cliff by the rope. The rope catches

   their fall.

                            KRISTOFF

                  Whoa! That happened.

   Back up top, Olaf emerges from the woods. He's a complete

   mess, all his body parts are in the wrong places. He huffs

   and puffs, struggling to run.

                            OLAF

                  Ah. Ah. Man, am I out of shape.

                                                               75

FROZEN - J. Lee

   He stops. Puts his body back together in the right order.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)

                  There we go. Hey, Anna! Sven!

                  Where'd ya guys go? We totally lost

                  Marshmallow back there!

   Marshmallow steps up behind Olaf. Olaf turns to face him.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)

                      (happily)

                  Hey. We were just talking about

                  you. All good things, all good

                  things.

   Marshmallow roars and approaches Kristoff's snow anchor.

                              OLAF (CONT'D)

                  NO!

   Olaf jumps onto Marshmallow's leg trying to stop him, but not

   making much of a difference.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)

                  This is not making much of a

                  difference!

   Marshmallow flicks Olaf off his leg and right over the cliff.

                              OLAF (CONT'D)

                  WHOA!

   Olaf passes Anna and Kristoff.

                              ANNA

                  Olaf!

                            OLAF

                  Hang in there, guys!

   Marshmallow starts yanking Kristoff and Anna's rope up.

                            ANNA

                  Wait, what?

   Kristoff's head hits the cliff.

                              KRISTOFF

                  Aargghh!

   Kristoff passes out and hangs like a rag doll.

                              ANNA

                  Kristoff!

                                                               76

FROZEN - J. Lee

   Marshmallow pulls them up. He roars and breathes snow all

   over them.

                            MARSHMALLOW

                  Don't come back!

                            ANNA

                      (grossed out by his snow

                       breath)

                  Ugh. We won't.

   Anna whips out a knife and cuts the rope. Kristoff comes to

   just as they fall. They both SCREAM!

   SLAM!

   REVEAL: Anna opens her eyes to find herself buried up to her

   shoulders in the soft thick snow. She laughs.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)

                  Hey, you were right. Just like a

                  pillow.

   She looks up to see Olaf's upper half hanging onto Kristoff's

   boots, which are sticking out of the snow.

                            OLAF

                      (shaking the boots)

                  I can't feel my legs! I can't feel

                  my legs!

   Suddenly, Kristoff's head pops up. He spits out snow.

                            KRISTOFF

                  Those are my legs.

   Olaf's bottom goes running by.

                            OLAF

                      (to Kristoff)

                  Ooh. Hey, do me a favor, grab my

                  butt.

   Kristoff grabs Olaf's head and puts it on his body.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)

                  Oh, that feels better.

   Sven walks up and sniffs Olaf's nose.

                               OLAF (CONT'D)

                  Hey, Sven!

                                                            77

FROZEN - J. Lee

   Olaf turns to Anna and Kristoff just as Sven goes to bite off

   his nose -- and misses.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)

                  He found us.

                      (to Sven, funny voice)

                  Who's my cute little reindeer?

                            KRISTOFF

                  Don't talk to him like that.

   Kristoff goes over to help Anna, who is stuck in the snow.

                               KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

                  Here.

   He lifts her out easily.

                            ANNA

                      (impressed)

                  Whoa!

                               KRISTOFF

                  You okay?

                               ANNA

                  Thank you.

   They meet eyes. Wait. Is that chemistry?

                            ANNA (CONT'D)

                  ...Um.... How's your head?

   She touches the spot where he banged his head.

                            KRISTOFF

                      (in pain)

                  Ah! Ooh!

   He catches himself. Waves off the pain with a giggle.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

                  I mean, It's fine. Ah...I'm good.

                  Ha. I've got a thick skull.

                            OLAF

                  I don't have a skull.... Or bones.

                               KRISTOFF

                  ...So....

   The awkwardness is killing him.

                                                            78

FROZEN - J. Lee

                              KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

                      (shy)

                  Now what?

                             ANNA

                      (shy)

                  Now what?

                      (then...panicking)

                  Now what?! Oh! What am I gonna do?

                  She threw me out. I can't go back

                  to Arendelle with the weather like

                  this. And then there's your ice

                  business--

                            KRISTOFF

                  Hey, hey, don't worry about my ice

                  business...

                      (noticing something)

                  Worry about your hair?!

   She thinks he means it looks bad. She smooths it down.

                            ANNA

                  What? I just fell off a cliff. You

                  should see your hair.

                            KRISTOFF

                  No, yours is turning white.

   She grabs her braid as a tendril turns white.

                            ANNA

                  White? It's what?

                            KRISTOFF

                  It's because she struck you; isn't

                  it?

                            ANNA

                  Does it look bad?

                            KRISTOFF

                      (thinking)

                  ...No.

   Olaf's head pops up. He's holding his head up off his body to

   join the conversation.

                            OLAF

                  You hesitated.

                            KRISTOFF

                  No, I didn't. Anna, you need help.

                  Now, come on.

                                                                  79

   He heads towards the sunset. Sven and Olaf follow.

                            OLAF

                  Okay! Where are we going?

                            KRISTOFF

                  To see my friends.

                            ANNA

                      (catching up)

                  The love experts?

                            OLAF

                  Love experts?!

                            KRISTOFF

                  Yes. And don't worry; they'll be

                  able to fix this.

                            ANNA

                  How do you know?

   He looks her over, remembering the moment he saw the trolls

   heal her as a child.

                            KRISTOFF

                  ...Because I've seen them do it

                  before.

   As they round the bend, the sun sets and Olaf turns to Sven.

                            OLAF

                  I like to consider myself a love

                  expert.

                                                           CUT TO:

   INT. ELSA'S PALACE -- DAY

   Elsa paces, distraught. She talks to herself.

                            ELSA

                      (mantra-style)

                  Get it together. Control it. Don't

                  feel. Don't feel. Don't FEEL!

   She hears ice cracking. Stops. Looks around. She's left a

   sharp wake of ice spikes behind her on the floor. They grow

   up the wall, taking over the castle.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

   EXT. BLACK MOUNTAINS -- NIGHT

   The Northern Lights are bright. Olaf stares at them in awe as

   he rides on Sven's back.

                            OLAF

                  Look, Sven. The sky's awake.

   Behind Olaf and Sven, Anna walks with Kristoff. She shivers.

                            KRISTOFF

                  Are you cold?

                            ANNA

                  ...A little.

   He reaches like he might put an arm around her, but decides

   against it. He looks around as if he doesn't know what to do,

   then gets a thought.

                            KRISTOFF

                  Wait. Come here.

   He takes her hand and pulls her around a bend into a rock-

   lined pass.

   Steam vents, powered by the volcanic activity, dot the path.

   He holds her hands over one of them.

                            ANNA

                  Oooh.... That's nice.

   They continue on the path, walking from vent to vent.

                            KRISTOFF

                      (taking a deep breath)

                  So, about my friends...well, I say

                  friends, they're more like

                  family.... Anyway, when I was a

                  kid, it was just me and

                  Sven...until they took me in.

                      (moved)

                  They did?

                            KRISTOFF

                      (nervous ramble)

                  Yeah. I don't want to scare you,

                  they can be a little bit

                  inappropriate...and loud...very

                  loud...they're also stubborn at

                  times, and a little overbearing.

                  And heavy. Really, really heavy.

                  They mean well.

   Anna touches Kristoff's arm, reassuringly.

                            ANNA

                  Kristoff, they sound wonderful.

   Kristoff smiles, appreciating her sincerity.

                            KRISTOFF

                  Okay then....

   Mustering the courage, Kristoff steps forward and with a wave

   of the arms announces--

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

                  Meet my family.

   REVEAL: he's surrounded by rocks.

                             KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

                      (to the rocks)

                  Hey, guys!

   As Kristoff and Sven move through the rocks, waving and

   greeting, Olaf and Anna stand frozen, dumbfounded.

                            ANNA

                      (to herself)

                  ...They're rocks.

                            OLAF

                      (realizing)

                  He's crazy.

                      (covertly, to Anna)

                  I'll distract them while you run.

                      (Loud and slow to a rock)

                  Hi, Sven's family! It's nice to

                  meet you!

                      (quietly to Anna)

                  Anna, because I love you, I insist

                  you run.

                      (to the rock)

                  I understand you're love experts!

                      (to Anna)

                  Why aren't you running?

   Anna snaps out of her shock and starts backing away.

                            ANNA

                  Okay. Um...I'm gonna go--

   Just then the rocks around her start rolling.

                                                              82

                            ANNA (CONT'D)

                      (panicking)

                  Kristoff!

   Olaf lights up and chases the rocks, who surround Kristoff

   and unfold as trolls.

                            BULDA

                  KRISTOFF'S HOME!

                            TROLLS (VARIOUS)

                  Kristoff! Kristoff's home! It's

                  been too long! Kristoff's home!

   Olaf jumps around all excitedly.

                            OLAF

                      (excitedly)

                  Kristoff's home.

   He then stops, confused, and looks to one of the trolls.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)

                  Wait? Kristoff?

   Anna watches, shocked and confused.

   The trolls all want Kristoff's attention. One troll yanks him

   down with a boulder's strength.

                            TROLL ONE

                  Oh, lemme look at you!

   Another troll tries to pull off his clothes.

                            TROLL TWO

                  Oh, take off your clothes,

                  Kristoff; I wash them.

                            KRISTOFF

                      (holding up his pants)

                  Ah! No. I'm gonna keep my clothes

                  on, thank you.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

                  Great to see you all. Where's

                  grandpa?

                            MUSHROOM KID TROLL

                  He's napping. But look, I grew a

                  mushroom.

                            TROLL SCOUT KID

                  And I earned my fire crystal.

                                                              83

                            KIDNEY STONE TROLL

                  I passed a kidney stone.

                            PICK ME UP TROLL

                  Pick me up.

   The kid troll jumps up on Kristoff's arm. Kristoff sinks

   under the weight of him.

   Anna still stares, confused, then realizes...

                            ANNA

                  Trolls? They're trolls.

   Silence. All troll eyes turn to Anna. Blink. Blink.

                            BULDA

                  ...He's brought a girl!

                            TROLLS (TOGETHER)

                  He's brought a girl!

   Suddenly Anna is surrounded by trolls. They body-surf/roll

   Anna over to Kristoff. She falls into his arms.

                            ANNA

                  What's going on?

                            KRISTOFF

                  I've learned to just roll with it.

   Bulda climbs on top of her husband, Cliff, to get a good look

   at Anna. She studies her like she's a piece of cattle.

                            BULDA

                  Let me see. Bright eyes. Working

                  nose. Strong teeth. Yes, yes, yes.

                  She'll do nicely for our Kristoff.

                            ANNA

                  Wait. Oh. Um. No.

                            KRISTOFF

                  You've got the wrong idea. That's

                  not why I brought her here.

                            ANNA

                  Right. We're not. I'm not--

   Anna laughs, uncomfortable, not knowing what to say.

   Kristoff looks over at Anna. She actually looks shockingly

   beautiful dressed in moss, lit by shimmering crystals.

   During this last bit Anna and Kristoff are looking at each

   Sparks! Chemistry!

   Just then, Anna collapses. Kristoff catches her. She's

   shivering something fierce.

                            KRISTOFF

                  Anna?

   He pulls off her cape and hat.

   Just then Grand Pabbie pushes his way through the crowd.

   Trolls clear the way for Pabbie. He stops at the edge of the

                  Anna, your life is in danger. There

                  What...? No.

                            KRISTOFF

                  So remove it, Grand Pabbie.

                            GRAND PABBIE

                  I can't. If it was her head, that

                  would be easy. But only an act of

                  true love can thaw a frozen heart.

                            ANNA

                  An act of true love?

                  A true love's kiss, perhaps?

   A bunch of trolls give each other kisses.

   Anna shivers again, collapsing into Kristoff's arms. More of

   her hair turns white.

                            KRISTOFF

                  Anna, we've got to get you back to

   Kristoff helps Anna onto Sven and hops up behind her.

   Sven takes off. Olaf grabs Sven's tail, rides with them.

                  We are here to find Princess Anna.

                  Be on guard, but no harm is to come

                  to the Queen. Do you understand?

   The Duke's thugs exchange a look. Suddenly, a mass of snow

   rises from the ground behind Hans. It's Marshmallow, Elsa's

   snow guard.

                               MARSHMALLOW

                  Go away!

   He slams a fist inches from Hans. Hans deftly dodges out of

   the way. All of the guards take up arms against Marshmallow,

   who quickly knocks them over.

   Marshmallow throws down a guard and his horse, who topple

   over Hans. Marshmallow raises his foot to stomp on Hans, but

   Hans barrel-rolls himself to safety. He sees his sword,

   leaps, and grabs it.

   Just then, Elsa peeks out the front doors.

   The Duke's two thugs see her.

                               DUKE'S THUG

                  The Queen.

   The thugs charge up the stairs.

   INT. ELSA'S PALACE -- DAY

   They guards burst through the ice doors.

   Elsa flees to the top floor of her palace. The guards pursue.

   They trap her on the top floor, raise their crossbows.

                            ELSA

                      (scared)

                  No. Please.

   One of the thugs shoots an arrow right at Elsa. At the last

   moment she creates an ice wall. It stops the arrow, inches

   from her face.

   The thugs reposition to take another shot.

                               ELSA (CONT'D)

                  Stay away!

   Elsa shoots ice at the thugs. They duck out of the way and

   continue the attack.

                            THUG

                  Get her! Get her!

   Elsa fights for her life.

   BACK OUTSIDE: Hans is nearly crushed by Marshmallow. He rolls

   away. Jumps to his feet. And with agile might, he slices

   Marshmallow's leg off with his sword. Marshmallow stumbles

   back, off balance. And falls off over the cliff, but not

   before striking Hans. Hans goes over the edge.

   REVEAL: Hans clings to the ice steps. His men help him up and

   they rush into the ice palace.

   INT. ICE PALACE -- DAY

   Elsa is surrounded. It's do or die. In two swift moves, Elsa

   traps one thug in a cage of spikes that threaten his neck.

   The other she pushes back with a wall of ice....up against

   the balcony doors...which BURST and CRACK.

   OUT ONTO THE BALCONY.... The balcony doors shatter. The thug

   is pushed to the edge. He's inches away from falling to his

   death.

   BACK INSIDE: Hans and his men run in. See the destruction and

   the thugs near death.

                                                                   90

                  Queen Elsa! Don't be the monster

                  they fear you are.

   Elsa snaps out of her rage. She sees the men, frightened,

   moments from death. She stops. Elsa looks to Hans,

   overwhelmed, frightened.

   The wall retreats from the thug on the balcony. The ice

   spikes lower from the second thug's neck. He takes advantage

   and aims his crossbow at Elsa's back.

   Seeing it. Hans runs and pushes the crossbow up just as the

   arrow releases. The arrow hits the ice chandelier, hanging

   directly above Elsa.

   The chandelier comes CRASHING DOWN.

   Elsa dives out of the way but she falls in the blast.

   All we see is ice smashing like glass, and all we hear is the

   sound of it shattering as it rings out.

                                                       CUT TO BLACK.

   FADE IN ON:

   Elsa's face as her eyes flutter open.

   She sits up. She's surrounded by stone.

   INT. ARENDELLE, DUNGEON -- DAY

   Elsa looks to the nearby window. Tries to rush to it. She's

   pulled taut by giant shackles that fit like iron gloves.

   She's chained to the wall.

   Elsa strains to looks out a window...

   INSET WINDOW: Arendelle is outside, frozen solid and getting

   further buried under the ice and snow that is falling.

                            ELSA

                  No....What have I done?

   Hans enters. He hangs a torch by the door.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)

                  Why did you bring me here?

                            HANS

                  Anna has not returned....

   Elsa looks to the storm with worry.

                            HANS (CONT'D)

                  If you would just stop the winter,

                  bring back summer...please.

   Elsa meets his eyes, desperate.

                            ELSA

                  Don't you see...I can't.

   Hans sees the sincerity in her eyes.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)

                  You have to tell them to let me go.

   Hans walks to the door. He takes the torch.

                            HANS

                  I will do what I can.

   He opens the door and leaves.

   Elsa, distraught, hears cracking. She looks down as her

   shackles begin to freeze over. The storm outside picks up.

                                                        CUT TO:

   Sven charges down the mountain with Kristoff and Anna on his

   back. Olaf slides along beside them, penguin-style.

   Anna shivers in Kristoff's arms. She's weakening. Kristoff

   takes off his hat and puts it on her head.

   They arrive at the walls of Arendelle. Olaf slides past them,

   out of control.

   He disappears into the village streets.

   Sven skids to a stop outside the gates. Kristoff slides off,

   holding Anna, and carries her to the gate.

                            KRISTOFF

                  I've got you.

   Anna looks up at him, gratefully.

                  Don't worry about me.

   Just then the castle gates open. Gerda, Kai, and a handmaid

   rush to help Anna.

                            GERDA

                  Anna! Oh, you had us worried sick.

                            KAI

                            KAI

                  We will. Thank you.

   Anna is swept away from Kristoff and into the palace grounds.

                            KRISTOFF

                  Make sure she's safe!

   Kristoff is shut out as the castle gates close on him.

   Kristoff stands there with Sven for a beat, staring with

   worry at the closed gates.

   Finally, he sighs, turns and walks off. Sven reluctantly

   follows.

                  left.

   Hans hesitates, realizing how much this kingdom has come to

   depend on him. Is he really all they have left?

   Just then the door opens and Gerda and Kai bring in Anna.

                            KAI

   She tries to kiss him, but is too weak to pull herself up in

   his arms.

                            GERDA

                  We'll give you two some privacy.

   Everyone shuffles out, leaving Hans and Anna alone.

                            HANS

                  What happened out there?

   Anna crumbles, weak.

   Hans carries her to a couch, sets her down.

                      (shivering more)

                  She froze my heart and only an act

                            ANNA (CONT'D)

                  ...You said you did.

   He goes to the window and shuts the curtains.

                            HANS

                  As thirteenth in line in my own

                  kingdom, I didn't stand a chance. I

                  As heir, Elsa was preferable, of

                  course. But no one was getting

                  were willing to marry me, just like

                  that.

   Hans crosses the room, grabs a pitcher of water from a table

   and goes to the fireplace.

                            HANS (CONT'D)

                  I figured, after we married, I'd

                  have to stage a little accident for

   Hans pours the water on the fireplace, putting out the fire.

   Anna tries to stop him. She falls to the floor, weak.

                            ANNA

                  ...You're no match for Elsa.

   He bends down, takes her chin in his hand again, this time

   not so gently.

                            HANS

                  No, you're no match for Elsa. I, on

                  Oh, I already have.

   Hans leaves and shuts her in, locking the door. Anna

   The rest of her hair turns white and she crumbles to the

                  At least we got to say our marriage

                  vows...before she died in my arms.

   He bows his head in a brilliant display of teary grief.

                            DUKE

                  There can be no doubt now; Queen

                  Elsa is a monster and we are all in

                  grave danger.

                            SPANISH DIGNITARY

                  Prince Hans, Arendelle looks to

                  you.

   Hans nods; he knows what he's being asked to do, and he'll do

   it with the perfect amount of authority and gravitas.

                                                               98

FROZEN - J. Lee

                            HANS

                  With a heavy heart, I charge Queen

                  Elsa of Arendelle with treason and

                  sentence her to death.

   INT. ELSA'S DUNGEON -- DAY

   The cell ices over. Elsa looks out at the storm that is

   devastating Arendelle, then hears the guards approaching.

                            GUARD (O.S.)

                  She's dangerous. Move quickly and

                  with resolve.

   Elsa pulls at her shackles. They crack. Just as the door

   busts open, the weight of the ice crumbles the walls. The men

   duck out of the way.

   Hans pushes his way into the room...sees...

   The back wall is blown open. Broken shackles rest on the

   floor. Elsa is gone.

                                                       CUT TO:

   EXT. MOUNTAIN SLOPE -- DAY

   Kristoff heads into the mountains. Sven lags behind, not

   wanting to follow. He looks back at the kingdom, then shakes

   his head. Enough.

   He runs past Kristoff. Stops and turns to face him. He snorts

   and grunts.

                            KRISTOFF

                  What is it, buddy?

   Sven nudges Kristoff with his antlers.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

                  Hey, watch it. What's wrong with

                  you?

   Sven snorts with more conviction, moos, brays.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

                      (avoiding)

                  ...I don't understand you when you

                  talk like that.

                                                              99

FROZEN - J. Lee

   Kristoff tries to walk on ahead, but Sven uses his antlers to

   lift Kristoff off the ground.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

                  Ah! Stop it! Put me down!

   Sven drops him hard then "yells" at him once more.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

                  No, Sven! We're not going back!

   Sven shakes his head, angrily.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

                  She's with her true love.

   Sven makes an "of-course-she-isn't" face. Kristoff gets it;

   he's made his point.

   Just then the wind picks up. Kristoff looks back at the

   kingdom. Sees a violent winter storm swirling over the

   castle. Sharp ice claws its way up the castle, encasing it.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

                  Anna.

   Without hesitating, he dashes back down the mountain. Sven

   runs after him, catches up. Kristoff grabs Sven's harness and

   jumps onto his back.

                                                        CUT TO:

   INT. LIBRARY -- NIGHT

   Anna shivers by the door. She looks up to see ice overtaking

   the ceiling.

   The door handle suddenly jiggles. Stops. Jiggles again.

                            ANNA

                      (barely a whisper)

                  Help.

   CLICK. The door swings open. We see a carrot in the lock and

   hear a giggle of victory. Olaf takes the carrot, puts it back

   on his face. Then he sees Anna lying there.

                            OLAF

                  Anna. Oh no.

   He runs to the fireplace. Throws in some fresh wood,

   including one of his own arms, which he quickly rescues,

   before striking a match and relighting the fire.

                                                           100

FROZEN - J. Lee

                            ANNA

                  Olaf? Olaf. Get away from there.

                             OLAF

                  Whoa! So this is heat....

                      (considering)

                  I love it.

   He reaches a twig finger toward the flames. It catches on

   fire.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)

                  Ooh! But don't touch it!

   He shakes the flame out, as he rushes over to help Anna to

   the fire.

                             OLAF (CONT'D)

                  So, where's Hans? What happened to

                  your kiss?

                             ANNA

                  I was wrong about him. It wasn't

                  true love.

                            OLAF

                      (confused innocence)

                  Huh. But we ran all the way here?

                            ANNA

                  Please Olaf, you can't stay here;

                  you'll melt.

                            OLAF

                  I am not leaving here until we find

                  some other act of true love to save

                  you.

   He sits down behind her, stubbornly. Leans his back against

   hers and thinks.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)

                  ...Do you happen to have any ideas?

                            ANNA

                  I don't even know what love is.

                            OLAF

                      (confident)

                  That's okay, I do....

   Olaf hops back up and puts a soothing hand on her shoulder.

                                                           101

FROZEN - J. Lee

                            OLAF (CONT'D)

                  Love is...putting someone else's

                  needs before yours, like, you know,

                  how Kristoff brought you back here

                  to Hans and left you forever.

                            ANNA

                  ...Kristoff loves me?

                            OLAF

                  Wow, you really don't know anything

                  about love, do you?

   His face starts to melt.

                            ANNA

                  Olaf, you're melting.

                            OLAF

                      (sweet and reassuring)

                  Some people are worth melting for.

   But then...his face REALLY melts. He panics, pushes the snow

   back in place.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)

                  Just maybe not right this second.

   Suddenly, the window blows open, cold wind sweeps in.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)

                  Don't worry, I've got it!

   Olaf flitters to the window. He pulls one panel of it shut

   but struggles with the second panel.

                             OLAF (CONT'D)

                      (determined)

                  We're going to get through--

                      (distracted)

                  Oh, wait. Hang on. I'm getting

                  something.

   He breaks an icicle off the window, uses it as a telescope

   and sees...

   Kristoff and Sven running back down the mountain.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)

                  It's Kristoff and Sven! They're

                  coming back this way.

                            ANNA

                  ...They-they are?

                                                           102

FROZEN - J. Lee

                            OLAF

                  Wow, he's really moving fast.

                  Huh.... I guess I was wrong. I

                  guess Kristoff doesn't love you

                  enough to leave you behind.

   Anna tries to get to her feet.

                            ANNA

                  Help me up, Olaf. Please.

   He hurries over, tumbling over the couch, knocking over the

   chess set and water jugs.

                            OLAF

                  No, no, no, no, no. You need to

                  stay by the fire and keep warm.

                            ANNA

                  I need to get to Kristoff.

                            OLAF

                      (clueless)

                  Why...?

                      (realizing)

                  Oh, oh, oh, I know why.

   He hops around in an excited display of hope.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)

                  There's your act of true love,

                  right there, riding across the

                  fjords like a valiant, pungent

                  reindeer king! Come on!

   The walls crack under the ice pressure.

                              OLAF (CONT'D)

                  Look out!

   They rush out the room just as the ceiling collapses.

   INT. CASTLE HALLWAY -- DAY

   Anna and Olaf struggle down the hall. Ice spikes grow and

   block their path.

                            OLAF

                  We're trapped.

   Anna looks around desperately for a way out.

                                                            103

FROZEN - J. Lee

   EXT. FJORD -- DAY

   Elsa runs, but is nearly blinded by the snow and wind.

   EXT. CASTLE -- DAY

   Anna and Olaf bust open a window. The storm is so strong it

   sweeps the window panes away.

                            OLAF

                  Slide, Anna.

   It's a long, snowy way down. But what choice do they have?

   They slide down the iced-covered building.

   Anna arrives at the bottom, weak but uninjured. Olaf gathers

   snow along the way. He arrives at the bottom as a giant

   snowball.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)

                  We made it!

   He shakes off the extra snow as Anna struggles to her feet.

   EXT. FJORD -- DAY

   Kristoff and Sven bound off the mountain and sprint across

   the frozen fjord waters and right into the heart of the

   storm. Its white-out wind pushes them back. But they fight

   through.

                            KRISTOFF

                  Come on, buddy, faster.

                                                     CUT TO:

   Anna and Olaf reach the shore of the fjords.

                              ANNA

                  Kristoff!

   The wind lifts Olaf up and pulls him apart. He goes swirling

   off into the storm.

                            OLAF

                  Keep going, Anna!

   Anna struggles on.

                                                              104

FROZEN - J. Lee

                              ANNA

                  Kristoff!

                                                       PAN TO:

   Kristoff rides Sven past cracking, frozen ships. Sven

   struggles over the uneven surface.

                            KRISTOFF

                  Come on! Come on!

   Suddenly, a mangled ship, risen by ice, capsizes   over them.

   They give it all they've got as debris falls all   around them

   and the mast shatters. They make it past just as   the entire

   ship slams down and cracks the thick ice beneath   their feet.

   The ice opens up. Sven bravely jumps over a gap. But it's too

   wide. He bucks Kristoff to safety, but lands in the freezing

   water and disappears below.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

                  Sven? Sven!

   At first there's nothing but the wind and the tumbling icy

   water. But suddenly, Sven surfaces and claws his way to a

   floating ice chunk. He calls out, signalling for Kristoff to

   go on.

                              KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

                  Good boy.

                                                       CUT TO:

   Anna moves blindly across the fjord. Anna's hands frost over

   an icy blue. She stumbles on, determined. But she's running

   out of time.

   She clutches her chest. The color in her eyes fades, the

   inevitable is coming.

                                                       CUT TO:

   Kristoff, lost in the white-out, doesn't know which way to

   turn. But then he hears a faint--

                              ANNA (O.S.)

                  Kristoff.

                            KRISTOFF

                  Anna...? Anna!

                                                  WHITE OUT TO:

                                                              105

FROZEN - J. Lee

   Elsa struggles through her own storm, but the fear is

   consuming her. A dark shadow approaches. It's Hans.

                            HANS

                  Elsa. You can't run from this!

   Elsa backs away from him.

                            ELSA

                  ...Just take care of my sister.

                            HANS

                  Your sister? She returned from the

                  mountain weak and cold. She said

                  you froze her heart.

                              ELSA

                  What? No.

                            HANS

                  I tried to save her, but it was too

                  late. Her skin was ice. Her hair

                  turned white...

   Elsa's face sinks as she realizes what she has done.

                            HANS (CONT'D)

                  Your sister is dead... because of

                  you.

   Elsa drops to her knees, emotionally broken. And with that,

   the swirling storm suddenly stops. The snow freezes mid-air,

   hangs suspended, trapped in grief.

   Citizens and dignitaries rush to the wall's edge and look out

   to see...

   Anna, barely able to move but now able to see across the

   fjords to...

                            ANNA

                      (a whisper)

                  Kristoff.

                              KRISTOFF

                  Anna.

   Anna pushes on towards Kristoff. He runs top speed towards

   her. There's still a lot of fjord to cross, but Kristoff is

   giving it all he's got. He's going to make it.

   But then, Anna hears the sound of a sword being drawn from

   its scabbard. She turns and sees Hans, behind Elsa, as he

   raises his sword over his head.

                                                           106

FROZEN - J. Lee

                              ANNA

                  Elsa.

   Anna looks back at Kristoff as he runs for her. She gives him

   a longing look, but then turns away from him and then...

   Using all of her remaining strength, as Hans brings his sword

   down, Anna throws herself in front of Elsa.

                              ANNA (CONT'D)

                  No!

   In that instant, Anna freezes to solid ice. The sword hits

   her instead of Elsa. The sword shatters completely. The force

   of it sends Hans flying back and knocks him out.

                              ELSA

                  Anna!

   Elsa rushes to Anna and touches her sister's frozen face.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)

                  Oh, Anna...no...no, please no.

   Olaf walks up and sees Anna, frozen.

                            OLAF

                      (confused, sad)

                  Anna?

   Elsa hugs Anna and cries.

   Kristoff watches in shocked despair. Sven steps up to his

   side.

   Citizens and dignitaries on the castle walls bow their heads.

   All of Arendelle is joined in somber silence.

   But then, Anna warms. She begins to thaw.

   Olaf looks up and gasps. Kristoff and Sven notice, light up.

   Anna bends her arm and embraces Elsa.

                            ELSA

                  Wha-? Anna?

   Anna opens her eyes. She smiles at Elsa, relieved.

                              ANNA

                  Oh, Elsa.

   They embrace.

                                                              107

FROZEN - J. Lee

                            ELSA

                  ...You sacrificed yourself for me?

                             ANNA

                      (weak)

                  ...I love you.

   Olaf realizes what's happened. He's so excited about it, he

   lifts his head right off his body and exclaims--

                            OLAF

                  An act of true love will thaw a

                  frozen heart.

                            ELSA

                      (processing)

                  Love...will thaw...

                      (realizing)

                  Love.... Of course.

   Elsa looks at Anna with confidence.

                            ANNA

                  Elsa?

                            ELSA

                  Love.

   Elsa lifts her arms, and the ground shakes and cracks. The

   ice and snow breaks away and rises high into the air.

   Beneath their feet the bow of a ship thaws.

   The entire fjord melts and other boats right themselves.

   The villagers come out to see the warmth returning.

   In one final wave, Elsa draws all of the snow into a giant

   snowflake in the sky, then waves it away, leaving only a warm

   summer day.

                            ANNA

                  I knew you could do it.

                            OLAF

                      (melting, good-naturedly)

                  Hands down, this is the best day of

                  my life...and quite possibly the

                  last.

                            ELSA

                  Oh, Olaf. Hang on, little guy.

                                                                  108

FROZEN - J. Lee

   Elsa waves her hand and surrounds Olaf with a swirl of cold

   air. He refreezes. Above his head she leaves a little,

   perpetually-snowing storm cloud. Olaf loves it.

                            OLAF

                  Hey, my own personal flurry.

   Kristoff sees Hans trying to get to his feet. He marches

   toward him, prepared for a fight. But Anna puts up a hand and

   stops him.

                            ANNA

                  Uh. Uh. Uh.

   She'll handle this. She goes over to Hans.

                            HANS

                      (confused)

                  Anna? But she froze your heart.

                            ANNA

                  The only frozen heart around here

                  is yours.

   She turns away from him, proud of her words. But not yet

   satisfied, she turns back and punches him right in the face.

                            HANS

                  Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

   He falls overboard.

   Elsa comes over to Anna and hugs her. Over her shoulder,

   Kristoff meets Anna's eyes. She smiles brighter, happy.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

   EXT. ARENDELLE -- DAY

   It's a beautiful summer day. The mighty ships have been

   repaired and are sailing away.

   On one of the ships, HANS is thrown into a brig.

                            FRENCH DIGNITARY

                      (to Kai)

                  I will return this scoundrel to his

                  country. We shall see what his

                  twelve big brothers think of his

                  behavior.

                            KAI

                  Arendelle thanks you, my Lord.

                                                           109

FROZEN - J. Lee

   Down on the dock, Arendelle guards lead the Duke and his two

   thugs to their ship.

                            DUKE

                  This is unacceptable. I am

                  innocent. I'm a victim of fear.

                  I've been traumatized.

                      (bad acting)

                  Ow! My neck hurts. Is there a

                  doctor I could...No? And I demand

                  to see the Queen!

   Kai steps down from the gangplank to the dock.

                            KAI

                  I have a message from the Queen.

                      (reading a scroll)

                  Arendelle will henceforth and

                  forever no longer do business of

                  any sort with Weaseltown.

                            DUKE

                  Weselton. It's Weselton!

   The guards usher him and his thugs onto their ship.

   EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE -- DAY

   Anna runs through the crowd, pulling a blindfolded Kristoff

   along behind her. She's so excited she can't stand it.

                            ANNA

                  Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on!

   She runs him right into a pole.

                            KRISTOFF

                  Pole.

                            ANNA

                  Oops. Sorry.

   EXT. ARENDELLE DOCKS -- DAY

   Anna skips to the perfect spot and stops.

                            ANNA

                      (stopping)

                  Okay. Okay. Here we are.

                                                           110

FROZEN - J. Lee

   She takes off the blindfold. Kristoff opens his eyes. Before

   him sits the most beautiful, suped-up sled. Sven poses in

   front of it -- Vanna White-style.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)

                  I owe you a sled.

                            KRISTOFF

                      (blown away)

                  Are you serious?

                            ANNA

                  Yes. And it's the latest model.

                            KRISTOFF

                  No. I can't accept this...

                            ANNA

                  You have to. No returns. No

                  exchanges. Queen's orders. She's

                  named you the official Arendelle

                  Ice Master and Deliverer.

   Sven shows off the Ice-Master-and-Deliverer medal like he's

   king of the bucks.

                            KRISTOFF

                  What? That's not a thing.

   But he can't help but admire her enthusiasm.

                            ANNA

                  Sure it is. And it even has a cup

                  holder.... Do you like it?

                             KRISTOFF

                  Like it?

   He sweeps her up high overhead and spins her around.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

                  I love it.... I could kiss you!

   He drops her, suddenly embarrassed.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

                  ...I could. I mean I'd like to.

                  I'd... may I? We me....I mean, may

                  we? Wait, what?

   She gives him a quick kiss on the cheek.

                             ANNA

                  We may.

                                                              111

FROZEN - J. Lee

   He smiles and goes for it. It's a true love's kiss, alright.

   We move past them to find Olaf enjoying the summer.

   With his snow cloud safely overhead, he's free to smell the

   flowers, which he does. Then sneezes his carrot nose off.

   Sven catches it between his teeth. Olaf gasps as Sven sucks

   the whole carrot into his mouth. It's gone.

   Olaf's face sinks in sadness. But not to fear, Sven spits the

   carrot back out and jams it into Olaf's face where it

   belongs. It's completely covered in reindeer spit, but Olaf

   doesn't seem to mind. He hugs Sven happily.

                                                       CUT TO:

   EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD -- DAY

   The gates to the castle are wide open. In the courtyard,

   stands Elsa.

                            ELSA

                  Are you ready?

   Villagers cheer. Elsa stops and creates an ice rink. The

   people, skates at the ready, hope onto it and twirl about.

   Elsa then freezes the fountain in a beautiful design and adds

   some snow flurries for atmosphere.

   Anna comes slipping in. Elsa catches her.

                            ANNA

                  I like the open gates.

                            ELSA

                  We are never closing them again.

   Elsa then waves her hand and magical ice skates (literally

   made of ice) form on Anna's boots.

                            ANNA

                  What? Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful,

                  but you know I don't ska--

   Elsa grabs Anna's hands and pulls her along on the ice. Anna

   slips and slides, but laughs in delight.

   Sven goes slipping past. Kristoff runs after him.

                            KRISTOFF

                  Look out. Reindeer coming through!

                                                                 112

FROZEN - J. Lee

   Olaf skates and helps Elsa coach Anna.

                            OLAF

                  That's it. Glide and pivot and

                  glide and pivot.

   We pull away slowly, into the sky. We arrive at a bird's-eye

   view to see that where the castle had crumbled has been

   repaired with a ice.

   All is right in Arendelle.

                                                   FINAL FADE OUT.

                                  THE END
