Pleasantville - by Gary Ross - October 7, 1996

                          PLEASANTVILLE

                    A Fairytale by Gary Ross

     October 7, 1996

     "He was part of my dream of course 

     but then I was part of his dream too."

                      - Lewis Carroll "Through the looking glass"

	FADE IN:

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM. DAY.

	A college counselor stands at the Podium lecturing the high

	school seniors about their future.

				COLLEGE COUNSELOR

		... For those of you going on to college

		next year, the chance of finding a good

		job will actually decrease by the time

		you graduate. Entry level jobs will drop

		from thirty-one to twenty-six percent,

		and the median income for those jobs

		will go down as well ...

	There is some rustling in the audience.

				COLLEGE COUNSELOR (CONT)

		Obviously, my friends, it's a

		competitive world and good grades are

		your only ticket through. By the year

		Two Thousand  ...

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL. HEALTH CLASS.

	A different teacher lectures a different class of students.

				HEALTH TEACHER

		... The chance of contracting HIV from a

		promiscuous lifestyle will climb to one

		in one hundred and fifty. The odds of

		dying in an auto accident are only one

		in twenty-five hundred.

			(beat)

		Now this marks a drastic increase ...

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL. SCIENCE CLASS.

	Same angle. Different teacher.

				SCIENCE TEACHER

		... From just four years ago when ozone

		depletion was at ten percent of its

		current level. By the time you are

		twenty years old, average global

		temperature will have risen two and a

		half degrees. Even a shift of one

		degree can cause such catastrophic

		consequences as typhoons, floods,

		widespread drought and famine.

	REVERSE ANGLE. STUDENTS.

	They stare back in stunned silence. One of them, DAVID

	WAGNER, sits in the front row with a pencil in his mouth.

	Nobody moves ...

				SCIENCE TEACHER

			(chipper classroom tone)

		Okay. Who can tell me what famine is?

								CUT TO:

	1958.

	Birds are chirping. The sun is shining. All the hedges are

	neatly pruned and the lawns are perfectly manicured. A sweet

	stillness hangs over the SUBURBAN STREET, which is bathed in

	beautiful BLACK AND WHITE.

				MAN'S VOICE (OS)

		Honey, I'm home.

	SUBURBAN HOME.

	GEORGE PARKER enters the front door and hangs his hat on the

	coatrack. He sets his briefcase down and moves into the foyer

	with a huge smile on his face. It's a frozen smile that

	doesn't seem to be affected by too much in particular--like a

	tour guide at Disneyland.

				WOMAN'S VOICE (OS)

		Hello darling.

	WIDER.

	MRS. GEORGE PARKER (BETTY) enters, untying the back of her

	apron. She is a vision of '50s beauty with a thin figure and

	concrete hair. Betty crosses to her husband and hands him a

	fresh martini. She kisses him on the cheek.

				BETTY

		How was your day?

				GEORGE

		Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said

		that if things keep going the way they

		are, I might be seeing that promotion

		sooner than I thought.

				BETTY

		Oh darling that's wonderful!

			(an adoring gaze)

		I always knew you could do it.

	WAGNER LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.

	1996 -- (LIVING COLOR)

	DAVID WAGNER sits on his couch watching this entire action on

	a sleek new Sony T.V. He stares riveted at the set with a big

	smile on his face. David wears black shoes, black pants,

	black t-shirt and a black baseball cap, not a nerd exactly

	... He reaches next to him into a huge bag of Doritos, never

	taking his eyes off the show.

				GEORGE (OS)

			(on T.V.)

		Hey, Pumpkin! What's that smell?

			(sniffing)

		Is that your meat loaf?

				DAVID

			(by rote)

		"It might be ..."

				BETTY (OS)

			(shy smile)

		It might be.

	He leans over and kisses her--again on the cheek.

				GEORGE (OS)

		Oh Pumpkin! You sure know the way to

		this man's heart.

	There is a loud and inappropriate LAUGH TRACK. David smiles

	wider and is just about to reach for more corn chips, when

	his real MOTHER'S VOICE rings out from the other room.

				DAVID'S MOM (OS)

		... Bullshit Barry, that wasn't the

		deal

	INT. KITCHEN.

	David's mom paces the room with the phone in her hand.

	Between the plastic surgery and the make-up it's hard to fix

	her age.

				DAVID'S MOM

		No--you have custody the first weekend

		of every month and this is the first

		weekend ...

			(pause)

		I don't care if yesterday was the

		thirtieth, this is still the first

		weekend.

	INT. LIVING ROOM.

	Her words drift in from the kitchen while David stares at the

	show.

				DAVID'S MOM (OS)

		No I can't bail you out, I'm supposed to

		go to La Costa ...

			(beat)

		Well if I want to get a mud bath, that's

		really my business, isn't it?

	He reaches out and TURNS UP THE SOUND. PLEASANTVILLE plays at

	an unnaturally high volume.

				GEORGE

			(on T.V.)

		Hey. Where are those kids?

				DAVID

			(reciting--a little louder)

		"Right behind you father."

				BUD AND MARY SUE TOGETHER

			(on T.V.)

		Right behind you father.

	RESUME T.V. (BLACK AND WHITE)

	The Parkers' son and daughter (BUD AND MARY SUE) enter the

	foyer together. Mary Sue wears her hair in a pony tail. Bud

	has on a Letterman's sweater.

				MARYSUE

		Mother ... Father ... Bud has a little

		surprise for you.

				BETTY

		What's that Bud?

	Bud hesitates for a moment, then folds up a shiny blue

	ribbon.

				BUD

		First prize at the science fair. There

		were lots of swell projects--guess mine

		was just the "swellest".

				BETTY

		Darling that's wonderful. Except there's

		no such word as "swellest".

				BUD

		Well gee whizz, Mom. lt wasn't the

		"English" fair.

	There is another jarring LAUGH TRACK.

	CLOSE UP. DAVID.

	He smiles right along with it. David stares transfixed at the

	set despite the continuing conversation in the other room.

				DAVID'S MOM (OS)

		Well sure they can stay by themselves,

		Barry, but that's not the point. You

		said you'd take them.

			(beat)

		Well fine--they'll stay by themselves

		then.

				DAVID

			(quietly)

		What's a mother to do?

				BETTY(OS)

			(on T.V.)

		Oh--what's a mother to do?

	CLOSE UP. DAVID.

	He grabs another handful of Doritos staring at the T.V ...

								CUT TO:

	EXT. HIGH SCHOOL. (SERIES OF SHOTS) DAY.

	A cacophony of modem life. Beepers and nose rings--blue hair

	and tattoos. Dissonant boom boxes compete with one another.

	The hormones are running crazy.

	SCHOOL COURTYARD.

	lt is a large open area, alive at lunchtime. Groups of kids

	hang out together, divided by their various cliques. The

	music pounds in the background.

	CLOSE UP. DAVID.

	He stands at one end of the courtyard beside a chain link

	fence. Beads of sweat form on David's forehead as he speaks

	to someone in front of him.

				DAVID

		Hi. I mean ...

			(pause)

		... Hi.

	REVERSE ANGLE.

	A very pretty blonde girl smiles back at him. It's a warm,

	welcoming smile.

	CLOSE UP. DAVID.

				DAVID

		Look. You probably don't think I should

		be asking you this. I mean--not knowing

		you well and all ...

	REVERSE ANGLE. GIRL.

	She smiles wider at him, inviting him to continue.

	CLOSE UP. DAVID.

				DAVID

			(pause ...)

		I mean I know you--everybody knows you

		... I just don't know you ...

		technically.

	REVERSE ANGLE. GIRL.

	She nods at him ...

	CLOSE UP. DAVID.

				DAVID

		Well--I was just wondering--'cause I see

		you all the time in Algebra and I heard

		you humming that Van Halen song and I

		really like that song too ...

			(pause)

		Anyhow, I don't know what you're doing

		this weekend but my Mom's leaving town

		and she said I could use her car so ...

	REVERSE ANGLE. GIRL.

	She positively beams. The girl flicks her blonde hair and

	stares back at him adoringly.

	CLOSE UP. DAVID.

	Instead of smiling back, David just stares, then looks at the

	ground.

	WIDE ANGLE. SCHOOLYARD.

	For the first time WE SEE THAT SHE WASN'T TALKING TO HIM.

	David stands a good hundred yards across the schoolyard,

	rehearsing this speech while the young woman stands face to

	face with a much cooler boy. He has a cell phone and a very

	hip haircut.

	ANGLE. DAVID.

	David watches as the girl throws her arm around the boy's

	waist and heads out of the playground ...

								CUT TO:

	EXT. "LUNCHEON COURT". DAY.

	David and his friends are all gathered around the plastic

	picnic tables and vending machines that form the luncheon

	court. The chess club meets at one end and there are some

	teachers at the other. All the cool kids are on the other

	side of the fence but David and his friends eat lunch at the

	same table every day.

				HOWARD

		Okay, whose window did Bud break when he

		was playing with his father's golf

		clubs?

				DAVID

		Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr.

		Jenkins have?

	Howard looks at him, puzzled.

				DAVID (CONT)

		Salesman. What did Bud and Mary Sue name

		the cat they found in the gutter?

				HOWARD

		Scout?

				DAVID

		Marmalade.

	They all nod--and murmur with admiration.

				DAVID (CONT)

		Okay--here's one: Why did their parents

		come home early from their weekend at

		the lake?

	Everybody thinks.

	Nobody knows.

				DAVID (CONT)

		'Cause Bud didn't answer the phone and

		they were worried about him.

	It's quiet for a beat.

				HOWARD

		You're unbelievable. You'll win this

		thing for sure. When is it on?

				DAVID

		Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's

		tomorrow at noon.

				HOWARD

			(weighing it)

		A thousand dollars ... And it's on all

		night?

				DAVID

		Of course it is Howard. That's why they

		call it a Marathon.

								CUT TO:

	THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE.

	David's sister, Jennifer, hangs out with her friends in the

	parking lot. All the girls are dressed in the exact same

	uniform: Blue jeans, beeper on the belt, white V-neck T

	shirt, car keys in their hand. (Even the girls WITHOUT a car

	hold car keys in their hand). Jennifer is by far the

	prettiest and, thus, is the leader of the group. They all

	look toward the Luncheon Court where David and his friends

	are hanging out.

				KIMMY

		Omigod, it's so mortifying, being

		related to him. I can't believe you're

		like--

				JENNIFER

		Only on my parent's side.

				KIMMY

		I know, but you're like ... twins and

		stuff.

			(beat)

		You must be from like, the cool side of

		the uterus.

	A group of VERY HIP boys strut through the parking lot. They

	bop up and down with the self-confidence of all cool sixteen

	year olds. The girls freeze when they see them.

				KIMMY (CONT)

		Omigod, omigod--here they come.

				CHRISTIN

		Don't do anything. Just don't like--do

		anything ...

				JENNIFER

			(cooly)

		Hi Mark.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE.

	He pauses then looks over at her. Jennifer slides sinuously

	off the fender of the car, flicking her hair like a young

	racehorse. She has a perfect 16 year old body and the whole

	parking lot knows it. Mark heads over to her, followed by his

	lackies. The two groups meet at the tail-gate of the Nissan

	Pathfinder like a small summit conference.

				MARK

			(to Jennifer)

		Hey.

				JENNIFER

			(right back)

		Hey.

	Beat ...

				MARK'S LACKEYS

			(to Jennifer's lackies)

		Hey.

				JENNIFER'S LACKEYS

			(back to them)

		Hey.

				MARK

		Saw you at the mall yesterday.

				JENNIFER

		Yeah ... Saw you too.

	Everyone nods for a moment or two. No one says anything.

				JENNIFER (CONT)

		So you watching Pearl Jam on MTV

		tonight?

				MARK

		Yeah.

			(beat)

	Jennifer pauses, weighing the next statement.

				JENNIFER

		My mom'll be out of town.

	Kimmy and Christin positively GASP while Mark's Lackeys

	mumble and glance around. The import of the thing isn't lost

	on anybody. Mark bobs up and down a little faster.

				MARK

		So uh ... Maybe we could uh ...

				JENNIFER

			(smiling)

		Cool.

				MARK

			(nodding faster)

		Cool.

				VARIOUS LACKEYS

		Cool.

	Everybody bobs and shuffles for  beat, when Mark nods,

	summoning his flock.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. WAGNER HOUSE. DUSK.

	lt is a south-westem version of "Leave it to Beaver." The

	uniformity of Suburbia has been washed in earth tones. There

	is a red tile roof gracing every home. All the houses have

	the same anemic palm tree. It's a urban planner's version of

	hell.

				JENNIFER (VO)

		... I know, I know--He's just like so

		FINE ... I'm still like: "Omigod."

	INT. WAGNER HOME.

	lt is just as sleek and impersonal as before. Maybe more so

	at night. Jennifer crosses through the living room with the

	cordless phone attached to her ear.

				JENNIFER

		It was amazing, Daph ... I'm like:

		"Well my Mom'll be out of town." And

		he's like "Well then, maybe we could--

		you know ..." And I'm like "Yeah, sure."

		And he's like "Well, cool."

			(beat)

		I know, he's just so smart.

			(pause ...)

		I don't know. Maybe that black thing I

		just got.

			(pause ...)

		It is not slutty, Daph, it's cute.

			(pause ... )

		Well, "hello?" He's not coming  over

		here to study ...

			(beat)

		I know. Well I'm jealous of you too

		sometimes.

	INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM.

	lt is studious and academic--not joyless, but not colorful

	either. David stands at his bedroom window, staring outside

	with a cordless phone in his hand.

				DAVID

		... He's not homeless Howard, they just

		don't say where he lives.

			(pause ...)

		Well it's a silly question.

			(pause ...)

		Because nobody's homeless in

		Pleasantville.

	REVERSE ANGLE. HIS POV.

	His mother loads the final Louis Vuitton bag into her

	Mercedes.

				DAVID

		... because that's just not what it's

		like.

	She fires up the car and pulls out of the driveway...

				DAVID (CONT)

		Listen Howard--it's almost six-thirty.

		I gotta go.

	INT. WAGNER LIVING ROOM.

	The huge black TV sits like a monolith in the middle of the

	room. All at once David comes bounding down the stairs making

	a B-Iine for the couch. Jennifer enters just as quickly from

	the other direction, fiddling with her clothes.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE.

	They hit the coffee table and reach for the remote control at

	exactly the same moment. Both of them freeze then look up at

	each other in shock.

				JENNIFER

			(stunned)

		What are you doing?

				DAVID

		What are you doing?

	Neither one moves. They clutch the remote together.

				JENNIFER

		David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna

		like be here in five minutes.

				DAVID

		Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon

		starts at six thirty.

				JENNIFER

		Pleasantville Marathon?

				DAVID

			(almost reverently)

		Yeah. Every episode ever.

				JENNIFER

			(getting hysterical)

		Omigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's

		gonna like beeeee here!

				DAVID

		Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.

				JENNIFER

		Upstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any

		STEREO!

	Jennifer gets panicked and yanks at the remote. David yanks

	back and before they know it, the remote goes flying out of

	their hands, CRASHING onto the hardwood floor. lt smashes

	into a million tiny pieces.

				DAVID

			(breathless)

		Oh my God ...

			(sinking to his knees/

			scooping up the remains)

		Oh my God ...

				JENNIFER

		David, stop stressing, you can like--

		turn it on normally ...

				DAVID

		No you can't, Jen! It's a new TV. It

		doesn't work without a remote.

	David cradles the pieces like a fallen comrade, when the

	DOORBELL RINGS behind him.

				JENNIFER

		Oh my God! He's here!

	Jennifer sweeps some of the pieces frantically under the sofa

	and tries to adjust her outfit on the way to the door. David

	just stares in shock at the shattered plastic. Jennifer

	reaches the front door and wets her lips. She fluffs her hair

	quickly, sticks out her chest then swings it open.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE. FRONT DOOR.

	Jennifer steps forward with her sexiest smile, but it isn't

	Mark Davis on the other side. DICK VAN DYKE STANDS ACROSS THE

	THRESHOLD IN A TV REPAIRMAN'S OUTFIT. Jennifer looks at him

	puzzled. He steps forward, flashing her a chipper grin,

	toolbox in hand.

				DICK VAN DYKE

		TV repair.

				JENNIFER

			(beat)

		TV repair?

				DICK VAN DYKE

		Yeah. TV busted?

				JENNIFER

			(pause ...)

		Yeah ...

				DICK VAN DYKE

			(smiling wider)

		Well here I am.

	REVERSE ANGLE. DAVID'S POV.

	He glances out the front door toward a weird VAN parked at

	the curb. It says TV REPAIR on the side but looks like

	something from a medicine show. The antenna on top resembles

	a weather vane and the mural beneath it depicts a happy

	family from the 1950s, gathered around their TV set. Everyone

	wears a smile, including the dog. The hand-painted motto

	reads "Rob's TV Repair--WE'LL FIX YOU FOR GOOD."

	INT. LIVING ROOM.

	David looks back at Dick Van Dyke who smiles at him, then

	crosses to the living room STEPPING NIMBLY AROUND THE

	OTTOMAN. He heads toward the TV.

				DICK VAN DYKE

			(seeing the smashed remote)

		Holy cow. Look at that. Had a little

		disaster didn't ya fella.

				DAVID

		Yeah ... Sort of ...

				DICK VAN DYKE

			(setting down the toolbox)

		We'll get you fixed up in no time.

	He pops the top of the tool box while Jennifer and David just

	stare. It's a strange looking box with the same happy family

	painted on the side. Dick Van Dyke pulls out another remote.

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)

		I know how I'd feel if mine went out.

		Almost like losing a friend.

				DAVID

			(tentatively)

		You know, we didn't call any TV repair.

				DICK VAN DYKE

		Well that makes it a lucky day for both

		of us, hunh?

	Jennifer shuts the door and crosses down toward the living

	room.

				JENNIFER

		You think you could do this like soon?

		It's almost six thirty.

				DICK VAN DYKE

		What's the rush?

				DAVID

			(cutting her off)

		The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six

		thirty.

	At that moment there is a huge FORK OF LIGHTNING and a

	booming CLAP OF THUNDER. It literally rattles the walls of

	the house as Dick Van Dyke turns toward David.

				DICK VAN DYKE

		Pleasantville?

	David recoils slightly. Dick Van Dyke flashes him a smile.

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)

		Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it for

		years.

				JENNIFER

		That's not the reason. I've got a date

		at six thirty.

				DICK VAN DYKE

			(ignoring her/

			leaning closer to David)

		Hey--who did Muff in take to the

		masquerade ball when her date came down

		with the measles?

				DAVID

			(stunned)

		... Her father.

				DICK VAN DYKE

		Right. And how did she dress him?

				DAVID

			(still staring)

		... Like Prince Charming.

				DICK VAN DYKE

			(studying David/

			nodding)

		Nice ... Nice ...

				JENNIFER

		Um--hello? I've got like a social

		emergency here.

				DICK VAN DYKE

			(ignoring her)

		Remember the one where Bud lost his

		cousin when he was s'posed to be

		watching him?

				DAVID

		Yeah ...

				DICK VAN DYKE

		What department store did they go to?

				DAVID

		McIntire's.

				DICK VAN DYKE

		McGinty's.

				DAVID

		No. McIntire's. Remember:

			(sings)

		"For the very best in men's attire,

		Head right down to McIntire's."

				DICK VAN DYKE

			(stunned)

		That's right.

	He stares at David, speechless, for a moment, then smiles

	fondly and reaches beside him for his tool kit.

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)

		Say--why don't you take this remote

		instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph"

		in it.

				DAVID

		Ooomph?

				DICK VAN DYKE

		Sure. Big beautiful set like this--you

		want something that'll put you right in

		the show.

				JENNIFER

			(quickly)

		We'll take it.

	CLOSER.

	He flashes them a big smile and holds out a weird looking

	contraption that seems more primitive than space age. It's a

	strange combination of an early transistor radio and Flash

	Gordon ray gun. Dick Van Dyke extends it with pride, while

	Jennifer and David stare at him warily ...

				DAVID

			(beat)

		How much does it cost?

				DICK VAN DYKE

		Oh--couldn't charge you for something

		like that. It's free.

				JENNIFER

		Free?

				DICK VAN DYKE

		Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the

		least I could do.

	There is a SECOND CLAP OF THUNDER even louder than the first.

	The house rattles for a moment then is quiet.

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)

		Well, I better get going. Your show's

		almost on, and ...

			(smiling at Jennifer)

		It's almost time for your date.

	He places the remote control gingerly on the coffee table and

	smiles at them. Dick starts across the living room when he

	suddenly catches his foot on the leg of the ottoman and

	tumbles end over end. He rolls on the carpet, executes a

	perfect somersault and comes right back to a standing

	position. David and Jennifer stare at him stunned when he

	looks back at them and smiles.

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)

			(grinning)

		Take care now.

	There is another flash of lightning as he reaches for the

	doorknob. David and Jennifer look at one another while the

	front door shuts with a THUD. It's quiet for a second or two

	before there is another CLAP OF THUNDER. David cocks his

	head.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE.

	David glances down at the strange contraption sitting on the

	coffee table. It looks a little scary. Slowly, very slowy, he

	reaches down and touches it. Nothing seems to happen so he

	picks it up.

	CLOSER.

	David points the remote toward the TV set with an

	apprehensive look on his face. He winces a little, then

	pushes one of the buttons.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE.

	The TV set turns on. Oprah's face fills the screen as an

	angry housewife screams at a transvestite!

				DAVID

		Hunh.

	It ail seems normal as he pushes another button. This time

	the channel changes.

				DAVID (CONT)

			(relaxing)

		Great.

	He continues to press the button, flipping through the

	channels. Jennifer sees that everything is fine and reaches

	for the remote.

				JENNIFER

		Lemme see that.

				DAVID

		No way.

	He continues to flip through the channels, coming to rest on

	the Pleasantville Marathon.

	BUD'S VOICE fills the room.

				BUD (OS)

			(on TV)

		Gee whizz, Mary Sue--why can't I borrow

		your transistor radio?

				MARY SUE (OS)

			(on TV)

		I promised Betty Jane she could use it

		over the weekend.

	FULL SHOT. TV SET. "PLEASANTVILLE" (BLACK AND WHITE)

	Bud and Mary Sue clutch either end of a small transistor

	radio. They seem to be in the EXACT SAME POSITION as David

	and Jennifer, who are struggling over the remote control.

	ANGLE. DAVID AND JENNIFER.

	She tugs the remote while David yanks in the other direction.

				JENNIFER

		Do you mind. This is like the most

		important moment of my whole life.

				DAVID

		Forget it Jen, I've waited a year for

		this.

				BUD (OS)

			(on TV)

		"But I told Mr. Miller I'd bring a

		transistor in to electric shop."

				MARY SUE (OS)

			(on TV)

		"And I told Betty Jean she could have it

		for the picnic with Roy."

				JENNIFER

			(yanking at it)

		God, David. Just give it to me!

				DAVID

			(yanking it back)

		Get lost!

				JENNIFER

		YOU get lost!

	WIDER. LIVING ROOM.

	She tugs at the remote trying to wrestle it out of his hands.

	David pulls in the opposite direction as they POINT IT

	DIRECTLY TOWARD THE TV.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE. SPECIAL EFFECT.

	A huge white light emanates from the contraption, like their

	own atomic blast wave. The entire room is filled with a

	BLINDING AURA for a second or two, before it actually gets

	sucked into the TV.

	WIDE ANGLE. LIVING ROOM.

	It is suddenly empty--illuminated only by the soft glow of

	the picture tube. David and Jennifer are nowhere in sight.

	INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. (PLEASANTVILLE) DAY.

	David and Jennifer are standing in the middle of the 1950's

	living room, dressed in Bud and Mary Sue's clothing. They

	still clutch the remote control in the exact same position

	that was occupied by their fictional counterparts. David and

	Jennifer glance at one another, then look horrified around

	the room. THE WORLD HAS TURNED TO BLACK AND WHITE...

				DAVID

			(a whisper)

		Oh my God.

				JENNIFER

		What happened?

				DAVID

		I'm not sure.

	WIDER

	George Parker (Bud and Mary Sue's father) enters from the

	landing whistling a happy tune. He's dressed in a gray suit

	with a gray shirt, and a dark gray tie with little gray dots.

				GEORGE

			(as if to his own children)

		Hi Sport, hi Muffin ... Better get a

		move on, you're gonna be late for school.

	He continues to cross through the living room whistling into

	the kitchen ...

				JENNIFER

			(desperately)

		What did you do?

				DAVID

		I don't know.

				JENNIFER

			(examining her black and white skin)

		Uchh! Look at me?! I'm like so ... pasty!

	He glances down at the remote control that sits lifeless in

	his hand. David frantically presses the buttons but nothing

	happens. All at once, there is a voice behind them.

				VOICE (OS)

		Psst! Over here.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE.

	They whirl around to see DICK VAN DYKE'S FACE smiling at them

	from the TV set in the comer. It's an old '50s set with a big

	round picture tube. They run over to him as he smiles. His

	face is the only color in the room.

				DICK VAN DYKE

			(beaming)

		Told you it was your lucky day. Bet you

		thought I was just a fan or something.

				JENNIFER

		What happened?

				DICK VAN DYKE

		A miracle.

	They stare stunned at the TV set.

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)

		... See, every time I thought I'd found

		someone they'd turn out to disappoint me.

		They'd know the early episodes, but they

		wouldn't know the later ones ... They'd

		know all about Muffin but they wouldn't

		know about Bud ...

				DAVID

			(to the TV set)

		What the hell's going on!

				DICK VAN DYKE

		Shh! Can't talk like that now. You're

		in ...

			(smiles)

		You know ...

	David glances around at his black and white surroundings. His

	"mother's" voice rings out from the kitchen.

				BETTY (OS)

		Bud. Mary Sue ... Breakfast is on the

		table.

				DAVID

		We're in Pleasantville?

				DICK VAN DYKE

			(grinning)

		Dream come true, hunh?

				JENNIFER

			(panicking)

		This isn't funny! I happen to have a

		very important date in like five minutes!

				DICK VAN DYKE

		Well, you don't have to worry about that

		anymore.

	FULL SHOT. TELEVISION SET. (COLOR)

	All at once the scene on the TV changes and Dick Van Dyke's

	picture gives way to a WIDE ANGLE SHOT of the WAGNER HOUSE.

	Mark Davis is standing at the front door, BANGING on the

	brass knocker. He checks his watch, shifts restlessly for a

	moment or two, then turns and heads down the flagstone walk

	never looking back.

				MARK DAVIS

			(under his breath)

		... Bitch.

	INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. (BLACK AND WHITE AGAIN)

	Jennifer flings herself at the screen, as Dick Van Dyke

	appears all over again.

				JENNIFER

		Noooooo!

				DAVID

		You--you gotta get us out of here.

				DICK VAN DYKE

			(recoiling slightly)

		Why would I do that?

				DAVID

		Because we don't belong!

				DICK VAN DYKE

		Oh sure you do ... "McIntire's

		Department store" ... "Their father

		dressed as Prince Charming." That was

		gorgeous Bud.

				DAVID

		My name's David.

				JENNIFER

			(wailing on the floor)

		Oh GOD ...

				DICK VAN DYKE

			(a little snippy)

		You know--this is a pretty strange way

		of showing your appreciation.

				DAVID

		Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We

		just--we want to go home now.

				DICK VAN DYKE

			(hurt)

		But you don't know how long I've been

		looking for someone like you.

	A long face slowly descends on him.

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)

		I'm very disappointed ...

			(deep breath)

		In fact ... I'm starting to get a little

		upset.

	David moves toward the screen.

				DAVID

		Don't get upset.

				DICK VAN DYKE

			(snapping back)

		Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone

		for years ... You pour your heart into

		it ... This is a privilege you know.

			(shakes his head)

		I don't think I better talk about this

		right now.

				DAVID

		Where are you going ...

				DICK VAN DYKE

		I don't think we should discuss this

		until I'm a little bit more composed.

				DAVID

		WAIT A MINUTE!!

				DICK VAN DYKE

			(turning his back)

		Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so

		emotional ...

				DAVID

		COME BACK!!!

	Dick Van Dyke shakes his head and walks out of the shot as

	the screen goes completely BLACK. It cuts out entirely as

	Jennifer and David just stare. David grabs the remote and

	starts rapidly pushing buttons.

	Nothing happens.

				DAVID (CONT)

			(dropping the gizmo)

		Oh God.

				JENNIFER

		What's going to happen?

				DAVID

		I don't know ... It's not possible ...

			(looking at her)

		Is it possible?

				BETTY (OS)

		Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is

		getting cold.

				DAVID

		It can't be possible.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE.

	Betty (their "mother") sticks her head into the living room

	wearing her black and white apron. She has a great big

	Pepsodent smile.

				BETTY

		Well, come on kids. You're not going off

		to school without a hot breakfast inside

		you ...

	They just stare at her.

				BETTY (CONT)

		Forward march.

	They exchange a strange little glance then slowly rise to

	their feet. Jennifer waits for David who forces a smile then

	starts toward the kitchen.

				BETTY (CONT)

		I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue.

		It's so flattering.

				JENNIFER

			(dazed)

		Thanks.

	INT. KITCHEN.

	David and Jennifer walk two steps into the kitchen when they

	suddenly freeze--agape at the spectacle in front of them:

	THEIR POV. PARKER KITCHEN.

	Every breakfast food imaginable has been laid upon the table.

	There are hotcakes and sausages and biscuits and eggs.

	Pitchers of orange juice are dwarfed by the mountains of ham.

	The table literally sags under the weight of the food. George

	Parker lowers his morning paper and smiles at his children.

				GEORGE

			(once again)

		Morning kids. Better get a move on or

		you're going to be late for school.

	They nod, stunned, and wander forward into the room. Bright

	sunlight streams through the kitchen window as a gentle

	symphony of songbirds sings outside. David and Jennifer stare

	straight ahead as their "mother" adds some waffles to the

	heap.

				DAVID

			(under his breath)

		I don't believe this.

				JENNIFER

		Neither do I.

				GEORGE

		Well, c'mon. Dig in.

	David and Jennifer stare at her stunned as she puts two

	heaping plates at their places. Neither one moves.

				BETTY

			(to Jennifer)

		I put blueberries in them just the way

		you like.

				JENNIFER

		Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.

				BETTY

			(big smile)

		Oh nonsense young lady. You're going to

		start your day with a nice big breakfast.

	She takes Jennifer by the shoulders and "guides" her into the

	chair. Jennifer looks down at a huge plate of GRAY WAFFLES.

				BETTY (CONT)

			(oppressively chipper)

		Here. Why don't you have some waffle

		cakes.

			(beat)

		And there's sausage and eggs and some

		good crisp bacon ...

			(beat)

		... And a ham steak.

	Betty drenches the waffles in syrup and slathers on a huge

	slab of butter.

				BETTY (CONT)

		... And of course, a nice big bowl of

		oatmeal.

	Jennifer hesitates then glances over at her "mother" who

	looks at her expectantly. She glances at David who just looks

	stunned. Jennifer pauses then reaches down and takes a

	forkful of the oozing mess ...

								CUT TO:

	FULL SHOT. PAT BOONE.

	He stands facing the CAMERA in an actual Kinescope from 1958.

	The backdrop is a painted pastoral landscape and the

	background singers are all white debutantes. He wears a

	letterman's sweater and button down shirt ...

				PAT BOONE

		"... Tooty fruity--oh rooty. Tooty Fruity

		... Oh rooty."

	He CONTINUES his homogenized version of Little Richard's

	nasty hit, (all the nastiness gone). It becomes a slow and

	lilting melody ...

				PAT BOONE (CONT)

		"... Tooty fruity--oh rooty ..."

	SERIES OF SHOTS. PLEASANTVILLE.

	The MUSIC CONTINUES as the CAMERA CUTS TO image after image

	of this strange "Utopia." The effect is a weird, sanitizied

	version of MTV--as if Ronald Reagan had shot a music video.

	There are men tipping their hats and women walking their

	dogs; cheery gas station attendants and smiling policemen.

				PAT BOONE (VO)

			(slowly ...)

		"... A wap bop a loo bop--a wap barn boom."

	Pruned hedges. Twin beds. BIG houses. The CAMERA CRANES DOWN

	in the middle of a beautiful tree lined street to find David

	and Jennifer walking up the sidewalk, holding their stomachs.

				JENNIFER

		I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.

				DAVID

		Just take deep breaths.

				JENNIFER

		All that animal fat. I feel it in my

		pores or something.

	Jennifer clutches her stomach, but David's glance darts from

	side to side--totally absorbed.

				JENNIFER (CONT)

		I still don't see why we're doing this.

				DAVID

		We're supposed to be in school.

				JENNIFER

		We're supposed to be at home David! We're

		supposed to be in color!

			(wailing)

		Oh God ...

	A man calls out from across the street.

				MR. SIMPSON

		Hello Bud.

				DAVID

		Hello Mr. Simpson.

				MR. SIMPSON

		Hear your Dad got a new car.

				DAVID

		Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.

				JENNIFER

		You know him?

				DAVID

		Owns the hardware store.

				JENNIFER

		Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know

		what's going on but you'd better fix it!

		I had a date with Mark Davis and I even

		bought new UNDERWEAR!

				DAVID

		We just gotta play along for a little

		while ... till that guy shows up again.

		Then I'll talk to him and ...

				JENNIFER

		Play along?

				DAVID

		Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and

		you're ... um--Mary Sue.

				JENNIFER

			(ripping the barette from her hair)

		No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't

		dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell

		not going to do it for you!

				DAVID

		We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck

		until he comes back.

				JENNIFER

		Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?

				DAVID

		To who?

	Jen looks around this cheery little street, and the horror

	starts to dawn on her. At that moment, they hear a screaming

	SIREN and a bright GRAY FIRE ENGINE comes racing up the

	block.

	WIDER.

	Jennifer and David step back on the curb as the firemen come

	flying out of the truck, grabbing the ladder on the back.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE. (FOLLOWING THE FIREMEN)

	They work in perfect precision. Two firemen grab the base of

	the ladder while a third takes the front. They go tearing

	across one of the lawns, in full "emergency response"

	anchoring the ladder into the ground and winging it up into a

	tree.

				FIREMAN

		C'mere, kitty ...

	He emerges a moment later with the cat who was stuck in the

	tree. Jennifer sinks to the curb as he carries the kitten by

	them, petting it gently as he goes.

				JENNIFER

		Oh God, we are. We're stuck in like

		"Nerdville".

			(shakes her head)

		I always knew you'd pay a price for

		this. I knew you couldn't be hopelessly

		geekridden for this long without

		suffering some like, really tragic

		consequences.

			(voice wavering)

		... But it's just not fair. I mean--I'm

		starting to get really--popular. Debbi

		Russell transferred to another school

		and my skin's been great since March and

		Mark Davis is starting to come around

		and ...

				BOY'S VOICE (OS)

		Hello Mary Sue.

	Jennifer turns to see a strapping blonde seventeen year old

	driving by in his convertible. He is extremely handsome with

	Jack Armstrong features and a Letterman's sweater. Despite

	her crisis, Jennifer's jaw drops open as he slows to a crawl.

	Biff Martin flashes a huge Pepsodent smile. The guy is a

	"dreamboat".

				BIFF (CONT)

		What's all the commotion? Where's the

		cat?

				JENNIFER

		Um ... It's ...

	Biff turns to see the fireman climb into the truck, with the

	kitty in his arms.

				BIFF

		Ah, right ...

			(smiling at her again)

		Well--guess I'll see ya later Mary Sue.

	He takes off down the street with the sun glinting on his

	really keen convertible. Jennifer gapes as he disappears

	around the corner.

				JENNIFER

		Who's that?

				DAVID

		Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball

		team.

				JENNIFER

			(still gaping)

		Does he--you know--like "me"?

				DAVID

		As a matter of fact he does.

				JENNIFER

			(flicking her hair)

		Hunh.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. PLEASANTVILLE HIGH SCHOOL. DAY.

	Streams of impeccably kept youngsters file through the double

	doors. All cheery and very pleasant looking. It looks like a

	Leni Riefenstahl movie.

	ANGLE. FROM ACROSS THE STREET.

	David stands beside Jennifer looking at the entrance to the

	school. Three girls huddle together by the front steps.

				JENNIFER

		Those are my friends.

				DAVID

		Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.

				JENNIFER

			(staring at them)

		Can we do any better?

				DAVID

		I don't think so.

				LISA ANNE

			(seeing her)

		Mary Sue. You're gonna be late for

		Geography.

				JENNIFER

		Okay ...

	She flicks her hair back--cops a first day of school

	attitude, and heads across the street like she owns the

	place.

								CUT TO:

	INT. GEOGRAPHY CLASS. LATER ...

	It looks like a propaganda film from the Eisenhower

	Administration. The boys all wear crew cuts and short sleeve

	button down shirts. The girls all have lacy dresses buttoned

	to the neck. Everyone stares straight ahead at the

	blackboard.

	ANGLE. FRONT OF THE ROOM. TEACHER.

	Miss Peters stands in front of the class with a pointer in

	her hand. She indicates a diagram that spans the length of

	the blackboard.

				MISS PETERS

		Last week Class, we discussed the

		geography of Main Street. This week,

		we're going to be talking about Elm

		Street. Can anyone tell me one of the

		differences between Elm Street and Main

		Street?

			(pointing)

		Tommy.

				TOMMY

		It's not as long?

	Jennifer looks stunned as several students nod.

				MISS PETERS

		That's right, Tommy. It's not as long.

		Also, it only has houses. So the

		geography of Main Street is different

		than the geography of Elm Street.

	ANGLE. JENNIFER.

	She glances around at several students who seem to be nodding

	in agreement. All at once, she thrusts her hand into the air.

				MISS PETERS

		Mary Sue.

				JENNIFER

		What's outside of Pleasantville?

	The teacher looks at her with a puzzled frozen smile on her

	face. She looks vaguely troubled.

				MISS PETERS

		What?

			(beat)

		I don't understand ...

				JENNIFER

		Outside of Pleasantville ... What's at

		the end of Main Street?

	The class lets out a knowing groan--as if to say "Oh. We get

	it now. Boy what a stupid question." Miss Peters gives a kind

	but condescending look.

				MISS PETERS

		Oh, Mary Sue. You should know the answer

		to that. The end of Main Street is just

		the beginning again.

	Miss Peters gives a big grin as a series of heads nod up and

	down. Jennifer stares straight ahead, dumbfounded ...

								CUT TO:

	INT. GYMNASIUM. DAY.

	There are fifteen to twenty boys scattered around the Gym.

	Each is dressed identically in white shorts and black socks

	with a "PLEASANTVILLE" jersey.

	SHOT. DAVID.

	He stands at the free throw line with a basketball in his

	hand. (Not exactly an athletic image.) David lets go of a

	jump shot that swishes effortlessly through the net. He looks

	a little surprised.

				DAVID

		Wow.

	He stares at the backboard slightly intrigued. David

	retrieves the ball and fires again, this time chucking it

	up blind. The ball sails through the hoop again, HITTING

	NOTHING BUT NET.

	FULL SHOT. OTHER SIDE OF THE GYM.

	Ten to twelve of his teammates fire simultaneously at the

	hoop. ALL OF THE SHOTS SAIL THROUGH THE HOOP, NONE EVEN

	NICKING THE RIM. The boys retrieve their shots as the coach

	claps his hands.

				COACH

		That's it men. Keep it up. Big game

		tomorrow.

	ANGLE. DAVID.

	He gets the ball and turns his back on the basket completely.

	David flings the ball wildly over his shoulder. It bounces

	off all the walls of the gym, then glides through the net as

	smoothly as the others. He stares in amazement.

				BIFF (OS)

		Bud ...

	WIDER.

	Biff Martin (the boy in the convertible) approaches from the

	other side of the Gym. He is a classic All American Hero--

	somewhere between 4-H club member and a future astronaut.

				BIFF

			(a little nervous)

		Hi ya Bud.

				BUD

		Hi ya Biff.

	He fidgets nervously for a moment looking down.

				BIFF

		Can I ask you a question?

				BUD

		Sure.

				BIFF

		Well ... If I was to ask your sister ...

		What I mean is, if I was to go up to

		Mary Sue ...

				DAVID

		Oh God! Are we in that episode?

				BIFF

		What?

				DAVID

		I don't believe it.

				BIFF

		What's the matter?

				DAVID

		You want to ask her out tonight, right?

		And then you want to give her your

		school pin ...

				BIFF

		Yeah ... How'd you know?

				DAVID

			(shaking his head)

		Lucky guess.

			(beat)

		Look, Biff ... I don't think it's a real

		good time for that right now ...

	Biff's expression falls. He stands crushed in front of David.

				DAVID (CONT)

		What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a

		little "different" lately ...

				BIFF

			(stunned)

		She won't go out with me?

				DAVID

		I didn't say that. It's just that right

		now ...

				BIFF

		I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't

		go out with me ...

	All at once, Biff takes the basketball he's been holding and

	hurls it toward the hoop. The ball does a couple of

	revolutions of the rim, and then amazingly pops out.

	WIDE ANGLE. GYM.

	Play comes to a halt. ALL THE PLAYERS TURN AND STARE,

	DUMBSTRUCK AT THE SIGHT OF A MISSED SHOT.

	SHOT. DAVID.

	He retrieves the ball quickly then hurries back to Biff.

	David pulls him aside as play slowly resumes on the other

	side of the gym.

				DAVID

			(under his breath)

		Look, I'm sure we'll work something out.

		I'll talk to her or something.

	Biff looks at him, troubled.

				DAVID (CONT)

		Honest. It'll be fine.

	Biff nods, a little confused, as David pats him on the back.

								CUT TO:

	INT. CORRIDOR. LATER ...

	David stands off to the side with his sister, while class

	pours out around them.

				JENNIFER

		No way.

				DAVID

		One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If

		you don't go out with this guy we could

		throw their whole universe out of whack.

				JENNIFER

		It's too weird David. This place is

		giving me the creeps. Did you know all

		the books are blank?

				DAVID

		What?

				JENNIFER

		I looked in the library. They got covers

		with nothing inside them.

				DAVID

		What were you doing in a library?

				JENNIFER

		I got lost.

			(beat)

		Oh here ... look at this!

	She reaches into her purse and pulls out a book of matches.

	Jennifer tries to light a Kleenex on fire.

				DAVID

		JENNIFER!

				JENNIFER

		Just watch. You know why those guys just

		get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing

		burns around here, that's why! They

		don't need any firemen ...

	Sure enough the tissue has become flame retardant.

				DAVID

		Jen, listen ...

				JENNIFER

			(trembling)

		I like--really need a cigarette, too.

				DAVID

			(putting his arm around her)

		I'll get us out of here. I really will.

		But if we don't play along we could

		alter their whole existence. We may

		never get home.

	She looks over at him, slowly.

				JENNIFER

		You really think anybody's gonna, like,

		notice if I don't have a chocolate malt

		with this guy.

	At that moment, three of Mary Sue's "friends" come tittering

	around the comer. They skitter up to her like a group of

	wind-up toys.

				PEGGY JANE

			(high-pitched--rapid fire)

		You won't believe what we just heard.

				LISA ANNE

		Biff Martin's going to ask you out.

				BETTY JEAN

		And that's not all ...

				PEGGY JANE

		No, that's not all ...

				ALL THREE TOGETHER

		He's going to give you his pin!

	They explode in a torrent of TITTERS all over again. Jennifer

	looks over at David.

	EXT. PARKER HOUSE. DUSK.

	A lone streetlamp glows in the foreground. Jennifer's voice

	plays OS.

				JENNIFER

		You sure I'm supposed to wear this?

	INT. MARY SUE'S ROOM.

	Jennifer emerges from the closet in a mohair sweater and a

	poodle skirt. Under the sweater she wears a 1950's "bullet

	bra" that turn her breasts into lethal weapons.

				JENNIFER

			(looking in the mirror)

		I could like kill a guy with these

		things.

				DAVID

		It's in your closet.

				JENNIFER

			(examining her profile)

		I've worn some kinky stuff before ...

				DAVID

		He won't notice anyway.

				JENNIFER

		What do you mean?

				DAVID

		They don't notice that kind of thing.

				JENNIFER

		So what's the point?

				DAVID

		Jen please ...

				JENNIFER

		He-llo? I've got like three pounds of

		underwire here ...

				DAVID

		Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late

		for work.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. SODA SHOP. DUSK.

	The flashing neon ice cream cone looks good enough to drink.

	Underneath it, the swirling script spells "SODA SHOP". Johnny

	Mathis drifts out into the evening air ...

	CLOSER.

	David comes sprinting up to the screen door and pauses to get

	his breath. He adjusts a little soda jerk's hat, then plunges

	inside.

	INT. SODA SHOP.

	Mr. Johnson, the owner and proprietor is wiping down the

	counter. He is a "pleasant" looking man, in his early forties

	wearing a white apron and black glasses. The strains of

	"MISTY" get louder as Bud lets the screen door slam behind

	him.

				MR. JOHNSON

			(looking up)

		Bud?

				DAVID

		Sorry ... I had to help my folks and

		then I couldn't find my hat ...

				MR. JOHNSON

		Oh.

	He stops wiping for a moment, holding the towel in his hand.

				MR. JOHNSON (CONT)

		I didn't know what to do.

	He stares at the rag a little troubled.

				DAVID

		What's wrong?

				MR. JOHNSON

		Well--I always wipe down the counter and

		then you set out the napkins and glasses

		and then I make the french fries ...

				DAVID

			(confused)

		Yeah ...

				MR. JOHNSON

		But you didn't come so I kept on wiping.

	He looks down at the towel clearly disturbed. David pauses

	for a moment then starts toward him.

				DAVID

		I'm sorry.

	He crosses to Mr. Johnson who has polished one section of the

	counter right down to the wood. David takes the towel out of

	his hand and folds it neatly in front of him.

				DAVID (CONT)

			(gently)

		You know, if this ever happens again,

		you can make the fries even if I haven't

		put out the napkins yet.

				MR. JOHNSON

		I'm so glad you're here.

				DAVID

		I understand.

	EXT. PARKER HOUSE. NIGHT.

	Biff's convertible rolls up to the curb with Pat Boone

	playing on the radio. He runs a comb through his short blonde

	hair before grabbing the bouquet of flowers next to him and

	heading up the walk. Biff rings the doorbell and, a moment

	later, Jennifer's silhouette appears in the doorway ...

				BIFF

		Oh. Mary Sue ...

	EXT. SODA SHOP. NIGHT.

	The place is really hopping now. All the spots in the parking

	lot are filled with vintage "jalopies" and several patrons

	are streaming through the door. The SAME JOHNNY MATHIS SONG

	is still PLAYING on the juke box, and the neon ice cream soda

	sign blinks against the sky.

	INT. SODA SHOP.

	David is trapped behind the counter, furiously working to

	keep up with the load. Several clean cut teenagers pepper him

	with orders while he yanks at the pumps and spiggots. It's

	clear he isn't used to this.

				DAVID

			(frazzled)

		Peppermint shake, chocolate soda, two

		orders of fries and a split?

				TEEN AGE GIRL

		Peppermint soda, two chocolate shakes,

		order of fries, and we'll split it.

	David nods quickly, wiping some sweat from his brow. He

	scoops some ice cream into the metal blender as Mr. Johnson

	comes up beside him.

				MR. JOHNSON

		There aren't any cheeseburgers.

				DAVID

			(turning)

		What?

				MR. JOHNSON

		Well, usually I put out the burger and

		then you finish with the lettuce ...

				DAVID

		Listen to me!

	Mr. Johnson recoils slightly.

				DAVID (CONT)

		Do you have the lettuce?

				MR. JOHNSON

		... Yeah.

				DAVID

		Have you cooked the burgers?

				MR. JOHNSON

			(quieter)

		Yes.

				DAVID

		Well you can just put on the lettuce,

		finish the burger and pretend it was me

		doing it all along.

	Mr. Johnson stares at him.

				DAVID (CONT)

		Really. It's fine.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE. SODA SHOP ENTRANCE.

	The screen door swings open and is held there by the end of a

	Letterman's sweater. A moment later, Jennifer sashays

	through, parading her new Jane Russell profile. Her

	"girlfriends" TITTER from the comer as Biff rushes up to a

	table, and pulls out a chair. She sashays into it, brushing

	against him as she goes.

	ANGLE. DAVID.

	He stares motionless at the spectacle--concerned and

	apprehensive. David holds a hot fudge sundae under the soda

	spiggot and jerks back on the lever blowing ice cream all

	over his chest.

	FULL SHOT. TABLE.

	Biff stares across the table at Jennifer with the wholesome

	devotion of a labrador retriever. He looks like a cross

	between Troy Donahue and a mannequin.

				BIFF

			(haltingly)

		I sure am glad you said you'd come out

		with me tonight Mary Sue.

				JENNIFER

			(full blown "Mary Sue")

		Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad

		you asked me.

	He guffaws for a moment or two before speaking again.

				BIFF

		I don't know if I ever said this to you

		before, but, well ... I think you're

		just about the keenest girl in the whole

		school ...

				JENNIFER

		Really Biff? The keenest?

				BIFF

		Oh yeah.

				JENNIFER

			(all sarcasm)

		Gosh. I hardly know what to say.

				DAVID (OS)

		What can I get you two?

	WIDER.

	He stands at their table holding a little white pad of paper

	and a pencil. Jennifer looks up at her brother and almost

	bursts out laughing. He wears his soda jerk hat at a jaunty

	angle with large white apron tied around his neck.

				BIFF

		Oh, I dunno Bud. Guess I'll have my

		usual cheeseburger and a cherry coke.

	More goony laughs. David turns to Jennifer who puts on the

	same dopey countenance.

				JENNIFER

		Oh, I dunno Bud. Guess I'll just have a

		salad and an Evian Water.

	He shoots her a dirty look. Jennifer just smiles at him.

				JENNIFER (CONT)

		Cheeseburger it is.

	ANGLE. FOLLOWING DAVID.

	He glowers at her all the way back to the counter. David

	posts the order in the little carousel clip board, keeping an

	eye on the table the entire time ...

	RESUME. TABLE.

	Biff gazes across the table at Jennifer with an adoring look

	on his face. His hands are properly folded in front of him.

	She's still trying to do her best "Mary Sue."

				BIFF

		See the whole time we were in civics

		together, I really wanted to sit next to

		you--but you were always sitting between

		Peggy Jane and Lisa Anne.

	There is some TITTERING behind her. Jennifer doesn't respond.

				BIFF (CONT)

		... And you always seemed so smart and

		everything. Like that report you did on

		"Our Town Hall." Gosh. I didn't know

		what I'd talk to you about.

				JENNIFER

		Well, sometimes talking's over-rated.

		Don't you think?

				BIFF

		Hunh?

			(goony laugh)

		Oh, right ...

	He still doesn't understand. Biff GUFFAWS for a moment or two

	then glances down at the table top. There is a momentary

	break in the Music as Johnny Mathis' "MISTY" starts up all

	over again. It's enough to make you shoot yourself.

				BIFF (CONT)

		So I know I haven't been steady with

		anybody, but I just don't want to rush

		it. You don't want to make a mistake

		with something that important.

				JENNIFER

		Oh, gosh no.

				BIFF

		I mean, there's kids that are even

		holding hands already but I figure

		there's plenty of time for that kind of

		thing later on. Don't you?

				JENNIFER

		Oh you bet.

			(beat)

		Will you excuse me for a sec?

	Jennifer gets up in a daze and heads toward the bathroom.

	ANGLE. DAVID.

	He freezes behind the counter and watches as his sister

	practically stumbles through the bathroom door.

	INT. BATHROOM.

	Of course there aren't any toilets. Jennifer gropes her way

	to the sink and leans against the counter.

				JENNIFER

		Jesus Chirist ...

	She turns and sits against the sink for a moment with a

	dumbstruck look on her face. Jennifer shakes her head for a

	moment or two, when the door to the bathroom bursts open.

				GIRL'S VOICES

			(overlapping)

		"Did he give it to you ... Did he give

		it to you ... I bet he gave it to her

		... Did he give it to you?"

				JENNIFER

			(straight ahead)

		I don't think he knows how.

	They TITTER away, even though they don't get it either. It

	sounds like an aviary.

				LISA ANNE

		I bet he's gonna take her to Lover's

		Lane.

				PEGGY JANE

		I bet he is. I bet he is.

				BETTY JEAN

		I bet he's even gonna hold her hand!

	They TITTER some more as Jennifer shakes her head.

	INT. SODA SHOP.

	David is standing beside their table as she retums from the

	bathroom.

				DAVID

			(chipper)

		Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry

		cokes.

			(pointedly)

		If you need anything, I'll be right over

		there.

				JENNIFER

			(Mary Sue)

		Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly

		need when we have each other?

	She flashes him a "sweet" smile then reaches out and TOUCHES

	BIFF'S HAND. Both boys jump slightly as Jennifer gives her

	brother a venomous grin then suddenly waves "bye bye." David

	just stares at her panicked as he moves haltingly back to the

	Soda fountain.

				BIFF

			(befuddled)

		Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over

		and sit next to you in civics but ...

				JENNIFER

		You want to get out of here?

				BIFF

		What?

				JENNIFER

		You wanna get out of here? You wanna

		leave?

				BIFF

			(confused)

		But where would we go?

				JENNIFER

			(shrugging)

		... Lover's Lane.

				BIFF

			(swallow)

		Lover's Lane!

	There is an audible GASP from the booth behind them. Jennifer

	ignores it.

				JENNIFER

		Yeah. Lover's Lane. You up for it?

	CLOSE UP. BIFF.

	He just stares at her with his mouth open ...

	WIDER.

	Jennifer reaches forward grabbing his hand.

				JENNIFER

		C'mon. Let's go.

	FULL SHOT. SODA FOUNTAIN.

	David is in the middle of making a hot fudge sundae when he

	sees Jennifer leading Biff by the hand into the parking lot.

	Everyone at the counter is enjoying their dessert, when David

	lets out a blood curdling scream.

				DAVID

		NOOOOOO!

	He vaults over the counter making a bee-line for the door.

	Everyone turns and stares as he races toward the entrance ...

	EXT. SODA SHOP.

	Biff's car is just pulling onto the street when David sprints

	into the parking lot. He takes off after the car, sprinting

	down the street.

				DAVID

		YOU CAN'T DO THIS JENNIFER! HE DOESN'T

		EXIST! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO SOMEONE WHO

		DOESN'T EXIST!

	The tail lights recede in the distance as David slows to a

	jog and then finally a walk. He pauses, winded, in the

	street, then looks up toward Heaven with a pissed off look on

	his face.

				DAVID (CONT)

			(to God)

		Thanks a lot.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT.

	It is a beautiful tree-lined pond with a lush willow tree in

	the foreground. The moonlight glistens silver across the

	water. Several cars are parked in a row with their occupants

	HOLDING HANDS. Biff's convertible is parked at the end.

	SHOT. BIFF'S CAR.

	He sits stiffly at the wheel staring straight ahead. Jennifer

	is draped languidly across the seat beside him, making the

	most of her mohair sweater. She stares at Biff in a not-so-

	Pleasantville-kind-of-way. He glances over at her and

	swallows.

				BIFF

		Sure is pretty.

				JENNIFER

			(staring at him)

		Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.

				BIFF

		To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think

		you'd want to come here until we'd been

		pinned for a little while.

				JENNIFER

		Oh, Biff. You can "pin" me any time you

		want to.

	She leans back a liftle more, draping her arm across the top

	of the seat. Her tits point toward the sky.

				JENNIFER (CONT)

			(breathy)

		Or maybe I should just "pin" you.

	He looks over at her a little confused, then breaks into his

	goony laugh.

				BIFF

		Oh, that's silly Mary Sue. How could you

		possibly pin me?

	CLOSE UP. BIFF.

	He is still guffawing when he looks over at Jennifer and

	suddenly freezes. Biff's eyes widen ...

								CUT TO:

	EXT. PARKER HOUSE. NIGHT.

	David comes sprinting up to the porch, then doubles over

	catching his breath. He clings onto the porch swing when the

	door opens behind him.

				BETTY

		Bud?

	WIDER.

	His "mother" and "father" come out onto the porch. David

	catches his breath then forces a smile.

				GEORGE

		Son, what's wrong?

				DAVID

		Have you seen Mary Sue?

				BETTY

		Why no. She's still on her date with

		Biff ... is something the matter?

				DAVID

			(still panting a little)

		No, I ... I was just ... worried about

		her.

	His mother and father exchange a "knowing" look. George rests

	a hand on his shoulder.

				GEORGE

			(oppressively paternal)

		Bud, your sister's a little older now

		and she's naturally going to start going

		out with boys.

			(beat)

		... In fact pretty soon--she's even

		going to get married and make someone a

		good little home-maker like your mother

		here.

			(smiles at Betty/

			inside joke)

		That's IF she can learn to bake.

				BETTY

		Oh, George ...

				GEORGE

		But your sister is a fine young woman

		and she would never do anything for us

		to be concerned about.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT.

	The low gutteral MOANS of two coupling animals drifts out

	over the evening air. It is raw and primitive and desperate.

	The CAMERA begins to TRACK behind all the other cars--their

	occupants primly holding hands in a tender sillouhette. It

	finally COMES TO REST on a convertible at the end, with a

	girl's leg sticking out the window.

	CLOSER.

	A Letterman's sweater hangs over the door. The windshield is

	completely fogged. Jennifer's sweater is draped over the

	backseat. The car is rocking.

	INT. CAR.

	They are clenched in a mad embrace: all arms and hair. Biff

	pulls back for a moment, GASPING for air. His face is covered

	with lipstick and there is a crazy look in his eye. He's

	stuck somewhere between passion and fear as he clings

	desperately to the steering wheel.

				BIFF

			(some terror)

		I think I better go home now Mary Sue ...

	She holds onto his shirt as her knee rubs the dashboard.

				JENNIFER

			(breathless)

		... Why?

				BIFF

			(more terror)

		I think ... I might be ill ...

	He glances down at his lap a little confused.

				BIFF (CONT)

			(a whisper)

		I think something's happening to me.

	He looks at his crotch then back at Jennifer. She reaches up

	and grabs a handful of his hair.

				JENNIFER

		It's s'posed to happen, Biff.

				BIFF

		It is?

				JENNIFER

		Trust me ...

	He looks at her completely confused as she pulls back down,

	and OUT OF FRAME ...

								CUT TO:

	EXT. PARKER HOUSE. NIGHT.

	A single light is burning in the kitchen window.

				BETTY (OS)

		Do you want some more cookies?

	INT. KITCHEN.

	David is at the kitchen table with a nauseated look on his

	face. There are three empty bottles of milk and cookie crumbs

	all over the table.

				DAVID

			(sick)

		Oh no ... I'm fine.

				BETTY

		How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?

				DAVID

		I'm fine.

	There is a knock behind them at the door. David springs up.

				BETTY

		Now who could that be.

	FOLLOWING DAVID.

	He crosses into the foyer ahead of his "parents." David

	swings open the door revealing Mr. Johnson, standing on the

	porch.

				DAVID

		Oh hi!

				MR. JOHNSON

		Hi there. You took off so quick. I

		wasn't sure if you were okay.

				DAVID

		Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm fine. I just ...

		Had to get home early.

	Mr. Johnson leans in closer and speaks in a CONFIDENTIAL tone

	of voice.

				MR. JOHNSON

		Bud ...

				DAVID

		Yeah ...

				MR. JOHNSON

			(sotto)

		You know how when we close up, I close

		the register, then you lower the shades,

		then I turn out the lights, then we both

		lock the doors.

				DAVID

		Yeah ...

				MR. JOHNSON

			(proud)

		Well you weren't around this time so I

		did the whole thing myself.

	CLOSER.

	Mr. Johnson has a strange look of "manly pride" on his face.

	His shoulders square back. His chest puffs out a little.

	There is a sudden sparkle in his eye.

				MR. JOHNSON

			(more confidential)

		Not only that, I didn't even do it in

		the same order. First I lowered the

		shades, then I closed the register.

	He looks at David with pride then suddenly shifts his glance

	behind him.

				MR. JOHNSON (CONT)

		Oh, hello Betty.

				BETTY

		Hello Bill.

	Neither one says anything but neither one has to. David looks

	on in horror as his mother locks eyes with Mr. Johnson and

	his new found virility.

				DAVID

			(quickly)

		Well, look, thanks for coming by. I ...

		really appreciate it.

	He turns and starts hustling him down the walk just as Biff's

	convertible pulls up at the curb.

	INT. CAR. CLOSE UP. JENNIFER.

	She looks sweetly over at the driver's side of the car (OUT

	OF FRAME).

				JENNIFER

		Well gee thanks Biff. I had a really

		wonderful time.

	ANGLE. BIFF. OTHER SIDE OF CAR.

	He sits behind the wheel with a totally dazed look on his

	face. Biff stares stunned at Jennifer, like he just got hit

	with a couple of thousand volts.

				BIFF

		... Me too.

	She leans over and kisses him on the cheek ... Then she bites

	his ear lobe, gently, and flashes him a big smile. Biff

	smiles back.

	EXT. CAR.

	She climbs out and shuts the door. Jennifer nods to Mr.

	Johnson as she heads up the walk.

				JENNIFER

			(sweetly)

		Hello Mr. Johnson.

				MR. JOHNSON

		Oh, hello Mary Sue.

	She is wearing a big smile by the time she reaches the porch.

	David grabs her arm.

				DAVID

			(urgent whisper)

		What did you do to him?

				JENNIFER

			(innocently)

		Nothing.

	She starts up the staircase. David follows her and the CAMERA

	follows them both.

				DAVID

		What do you mean "nothing?" That's not

		nothing. That's ...

	She reaches the top of the stairs and turns to him.

				JENNIFER

		Relax "Bud." We had a really nice time.

			(mock YAWN)

		... Now I'm really tired and we gotta

		get up early for school in the morning

		so ...

	She flashes her brother an evil grin.

				JENNIFER (CONT)

		'Night.

	She shuts the door softly in his face. David stairs at the

	gray wood in front of him.

	EXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT.

	Biff pulls up at an intersection with the same dazed look in

	his eye. The car rumbles at the stoplight for a moment or

	two, before he glances over to his right.

	CLOSE UP. BIFF.

	The stunned look turns to one of sheer amazement:

	BIFF'S POV. ROSE.

	There, against a gray picket fence, on a black and white

	street in a black and white neighborhood, A SINGLE RED ROSE

	IS BLOOMING.

								CUT TO:

	AERIAL SHOT. PLEASANTVILLE. MORNING

	It would be a stunning vista if it wasn't in black and white.

	The church steeple gleams in the sunlight. The perfect little

	houses look like a row of pretty toys ...

	INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. DAY.

	David sits parked in front of the TV furtively turning

	through the channels. He flips the dial frantically. No sign

	of Dick Van Dyke.

				BETTY (OS)

		Bud. It's 7:30 in the morning. Are you

		watching television?

	He gives her a sheepish grin and sighs ...

								CUT TO:

	INT. SCHOOL GYM. DAY.

	It is the same configuration as earlier. Everyone wears their

	Pleasantville "Lions" jerseys, white sneakers and black

	socks. David enters the Gym a little groggy. He hasn't had

	much sleep.

	CLOSER.

	He looks up and stops. David cocks his head to the side,

	staring across the gym.

	HIS POV. BIFF AND OTHER BOYS.

	They are huddled at the far end, each holding a basketball

	under his arm. Biff is in the center of the group, animatedly

	describing something that is holding their RAPT ATTENTION.

	WIDER ANGLE. INCLUDING DAVID.

				DAVID

			(quietly)

		Oh no ...

	Biff continues his story while they stare at him with their

	mouths open. The Coach blows his whistle.

				COACH

		Come on men. Let's go. Big game next

		week.

	The huddle breaks up as the basketball players all wander

	toward the hoop. Ten shots go up at once but NOT ONE COMES

	EVEN CLOSE. Several clang off the rim, a couple hit the edge

	of the backboard. One slams into the side of the gym.

	Everyone stares in disbelief.

				DAVID

		Oh my God ...

								CUT TO:

	INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR. DAY.

	David stands face to face with his sister in mid

	conversation.

				DAVID

		You can't do this, Jennifer. I WARNED

		you.

				JENNIFER

		So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay.

		They're like not good at basketball

		anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy.

				DAVID

		You don't understand. You're messing

		with their UNIVERSE.

				JENNIFER

		Well maybe it needs to be messed with.

		Did that ever like--occur to you?

			(beat)

		You know, they don't want to be like

		this, it's just that nobody ever helped

		them before.

				PEGGY JANE

			(walking past)

		"MS". How you doin'?

				JENNIFER

		Kewl "PJ". How you doin'?

				PEGGY JANE

			(relishing her new word)

		"Kewl."

	Jennifer smiles at her friend as she goes by.

				DAVID

		You have no right to do this.

				JENNIFER

		Well if I don't who will?

				DAVID

		They're happy like this.

				JENNIFER

		David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt

		and a sweater set.

			(pause ...)

		You like all this don't you?

	David recoils slightly.

				JENNIFER (CONT)

		I mean, you don't think it's just like

		dorky or funny or something ... you

		really like it.

			(shudders)

		Oh God! I am just so personally

		horrified right now ...

				DAVID

		I just don't think we have the right

		to ...

				JENNIFER

		David, let me tell you something. These

		people don't want to be geeks. They want

		to be "attractive." They've got a lot of

		potential, they just don't know any

		better.

				DAVID

		They don't have that kind of potential.

				JENNIFER

		Um--hello? You want to like take a look?

	Jennifer motions behind her to a boy and girt who are locked

	in an intimate conversation. The girl wears bobby socks and

	the boy wears a letterman's sweater, but the conversation is

	sexually charged. They speak to one another in a close

	whisper--their faces inches apart. All at once the girt gets

	shy and glances away. She blows a big bubble with her gum,

	but the BUBBLE IS BRIGHT PINK IN AN OTHERWISE GRAY FRAME.

				BOY

		Wow. What kind of gum is that?

	CLOSE. DAVID AND JENNIFER.

	He looks over in shock as she sucks the BRIGHTLY COLORED

	BUBBLE GUM back into her mouth. Jennifer flicks her hair.

				JENNIFER

		I gotta go. I'm meeting Biff at the

		flagpole.

	EXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT.

	It is the exact same shot as before: The CAMERA STARTS ITS

	LONG SLOW TRACK behind the vehicles, except this time ALL OF

	THEM ARE ROCKING. Various limbs and articles of clothing hang

	out the open windows. MOANS of pleasure waft out over Lover's

	Lane as the pond glistens in the distance ...

								CUT TO:

	INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE. DAY.

	It is a typical '50s family practice right out of Norman

	Rockwell. There is a jar of tongue depressors on the counter

	and a jar of lollipops beside them. Lisa Anne (Mary Sue's

	best friend) is being examined by Dr. Henderson. Her mother

	sits at her side.

				DR. HENDERSON

		Let me see it again.

	Lisa Anne opens her mouth and sticks out a BRIGHT RED TONGUE.

	Everything else in the frame is Black and White, but her

	tongue literally gleams with color.

				DR. HENDERSON (CONT)

			(examining it)

		Well ... I don't think it's anything to

		worry about ... It'll probably just

		clear up by itself.

			(to Lisa Anne)

		Cut down on greasy foods and chocolate.

		No french fries, that kind of thing.

			(aside/

			to the Mother)

		It's just a "teenage" thing.

	EXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT.

	It is really rocking now. More cars are lined up along the

	edge of the lake as the REAL (AND NASTY) VERSION OF TOOTY

	FRUITY (BY LITTLE RICHARD) PLAYS OS:

				LIL RICHARD (VO)

		"... Got a gal--her name is Sue. She

		knows just what to do ..."

	SERIES OF SHOTS. (MONTAGE)

	PARKER LIVING ROOM.

	TOOTY FRUITY CONTINUES AS DAVID FLIPS FRANTICALLY THROUGH THE

	CHANNELS LOOKING FOR DICK VAN DYKE. THERE IS ONLY A PEPSODENT

	COMMERCIAL. HE SHAKES HIS HEAD ...

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM (MUSIC CONT ...)

	The Pleasantville Lions lose a game late in the second half.

	The scoreboard reads 84 to 16 ...

	INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. (MUSIC CONT ...)

	David examines the back of the TV set ...

	INT. FURNITURE STORE. (MUSIC CONT...)

	A large group of customers is huddled in a circle, staring at

	an item on the display floor, like it is the monolith in

	"2001". They seem both confused and absolutely mesmerized as

	the CAMERA PUSHES IN TO REVEAL: a double bed ...

	INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. (MUSIC CONT ...)

	David sits on the floor with a weird look of resignation as a

	Brillcream commercial plays in front of him ...

				LIL RICHARD (OS)

		"... A wop bop a loo bop--a wop bam

		boom!"

	SODA SHOP. NIGHT. ON DAVID.

	He heads toward work with his apron and his paper hat, but

	he's clearly disconcerted. David stops and stares at A BRIGHT

	RED HOT ROD parked at the front door of the restaurant. He

	shakes his head.

	SODA SHOP.

	The place has been transformed. What was cheery and benign a

	couple of days before, has gotten a little bit dangerous. The

	letterman sweaters have been replaced by leather jackets. The

	Pat Boone and Johnny Mathis have given way to real Rock and

	Roll. There is a James Dean/Marlon Brando edge in the air.

	Somebody has played the flip side.

	ANGLE. DAVID.

	He enters the soda shop adjusting his paper hat. A young

	couple makes out passionately in the doorway--all tongues and

	hands. When they break David sees that the girl's cheeks are

	FLUSHED WITH RED. He stares at her for a beat as they return

	to normal. David shakes his head.

	FOLLOWING HIM.

	He crosses to the counter and grabs his pencil and little pad

	of paper. Various things have already GONE TO COLOR AROUND

	THE ROOM: The JUKE BOX ... The COKE SIGN .. THE NAUGAHIDE

	STOOLS ... David crosses to one of the booths where his

	sister's arm is draped over Biff's shoulder.

				DAVID

		What'll it be?

				BIFF

			(still chipper as ever)

		Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the

		usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke.

	Bud has already written it down. He glances over at his

	sister.

				JENNIFER

		Me too. Sounds swell.

				DAVID

			(pointed)

		Really? It seems so fattening.

	Before she can answer he smiles to himself and crosses behind

	the counter. Bud posts the order and turns to Mr. Johnson.

				DAVID (CONT)

		Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.

				MR. JOHNSON

			(staring straight ahead)

		There aren't any cheeseburgers.

				DAVID

			(exasperated)

		Look. I thought we talked about this, I

		thought we said ...

				MR. JOHNSON

		Oh--what's the point, Bud?

	CLOSER.

	Mr. Johnson. looks up at him with a weird kind of emptiness

	in his eyes. David grabs his arm.

				DAVID

		C'mere.

	He pulls him along the counter toward a little office

	storeroom in the back. He yanks him inside and shuts the

	door.

	INT. STOREROOM.

	It is just as cheery as the rest of the place. There is a

	small table with a telephone on it. A Texaco calendar shows a

	happy family motoring in their Rambler.

				DAVID

		What did you say?

	Mr. Johnson glances down with a little shame and confusion.

				MR. JOHNSON

		Well ... I'm not sure I see the point

		anymore.

				DAVID

		What are you talking about! You make

		hamburgers! That is the point!

				MR. JOHNSON

		No I know ... I know I do ...

			(he pauses, then looks up)

		But it's always the same, you know?

		Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the

		cheese ... It never changes. It never

		gets any better or worse ...

				DAVID

		Just listen to me ...

				MR. JOHNSON

			(not hearing him)

		... Like the other night, when I closed

		up by myself. That was different ...

				DAVID

		Forget about that!

				MR. JOHNSON

		Oh ... Okay.

			(beat/

			lower)

		... But I really liked it.

	Bud takes a deep breath. He stares at Mr. Johnson, then tries

	to speak softly.

				DAVID

		Look, you can't always like what you do.

		Sometimes you just do it because it's

		your job. And even if you don't like it,

		you just gotta do it anyway.

				MR. JOHNSON

		Why?

				DAVID

			(exasperated)

		So they can have their hamburgers!

	This sounds stupid even to David. He shakes his head.

				MR. JOHNSON

			(like a secret)

		You know what I really like?

				DAVID

			(warily)

		... What's that?

				MR. JOHNSON

		Christmastime.

	David rolls his eyes. Mr. Johnson leans closer, speaking

	furtively.

				MR. JOHNSON (CONT)

		See every year on Dec 3, I get to paint

		the Christmas decorations in the window.

		And every year, I get to paint a

		different thing ...

			(beat)

		One year it's the North Pole. The next

		I do Santa's workshop. Here I'll show

		you.

	He pulls a photo album from the back of the desk and opens

	it for David.

				DAVID

			(impressed)

		Wow ... That's pretty good ...

				MR. JOHNSON

		Thanks.

			(continuing)

		But this morning I was thinking about

		it and I realized that I looked forward

		to it all year. And then I thought "Gee.

		That seems awfully silly. That seems

		like an awfully long time to be waiting

		for just one moment, don't you think?"

	David looks at him speechless.

				MR. JOHNSON (CONT)

		Well don't you?

				DAVID

		I think you should try not to think

		about this anymore.

				MR. JOHNSON

		Really?

				DAVID

		Yeah.

				MR. JOHNSON

		Oh. Okay. I'll try that then.

								CUT TO:

	INT. BARBERSHOP. DAY

	The Barber Pole spins in three shades of gray. Several men

	are gathered around the two chairs in the front of Gus' shop.

	Besides being the barbershop, it is the bastion of all male

	life in Pleasantville. Bud and Mary Sue's "father" (George)

	sits in one of the chairs. "Big Bob" McGee, owner of the

	drugstore, supermarket and Chevy dealership sits in the

	other. He has a crew cut that's getting shorter.

				GUS

		Have they ever lost before?

				GEORGE

		Basketball? No they sure haven't.

				BOB

		Just feels "wrong", that's all.

	There are several murmurs.

				THIRD PATRON

		Maybe that's where they get that saying,

		"can't win 'em all."

				GUS

		Yeah. That's a good point, Ralph. They

		do have that saying.

				BOB

		But they do win 'em all, Gus. They've

		always won 'em all.

				GUS

		Well, yeah. That's true too.

	More murmurs, Everyone looks straight ahead trying to figure.

								CUT TO:

	INT. PARKER KITCHEN. DAY.

	The women's bridge club has assembled in the Parker kitchen

	like it does every Wednesday afternoon. Four women are seated

	around the kitchen table with a nice bowl of bridge mix

	between them. Betty is sifting next to Marge Jenkins, the

	woman who accompanied her daughter to the doctor's office.

				MARGE

			(dealing the cards)

		... He said it would clear up on its

		own if she just stayed away from fried

		foods and sweets ...

				BETTY

		Well that makes sense.

				MARGE

		Except it's spread to her lips now too.

		Oh, I don't know.

				MARY

			(a THIRD WOMAN)

		And you say it's just "red?"

				MARGE

		Well--like red, only ... "redder."

				MARY

		Hunh. I know what you mean. That's like

		the front of Bill Johnson's shop. I was

		going by it the other day and it looked

		green only "greener."

	SHOT. BETTY.

	She looks up quickly--then grabs some bridge mix.

				MARGE

			(lowering her voice)

		Have you seen him lately? The man

		doesn't look like himself. I was

		getting my sewing machine fixed across

		the street and he was sitting in the

		window of his shop just staring.

		Wasn't looking at anything in

		particular--just staring off into space.

				MARY

		That is strange.

	Betty reaches out and grabs her cards. She fans them out in

	front of her, when her eyes go wide.

	HER POV. BRIDGE HAND.

	They are ALL HEARTS and all BRIGHT RED. It looks like a

	fistfful of valentines.

	CLOSE UP. BETTY.

	She puts the cards down quickly and takes a sudden breath.

	Betty keeps them like that for a moment or two, before

	lifting them up and taking another look.

				MARGE

		Betty, it's your bid.

	She swallows trying to keep her composure.

				BETTY

		Uh ... Seven hearts.

	They murmur at the strength of the hand.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. PARKER HOUSE. NIGHT.

	The SOUND of the television plays OS while a warm light burns

	in the window.

	INT. KITCHEN.

	Jennifer and Betty stand at the sink finishing the dishes.

	Betty washes while Jennifer dries and it's clear who's more

	used to this. Jennifer examines a chipped nail as she places

	a dish in the drying rack.

				BETTY

		Mary Sue?

				JENNIFER

		Yeah?

	Betty hesitates. Rinses out a pot.

				BETTY

		Can I ask you a question?

				JENNIFER

		Sure.

	She pauses for a long moment.

				BETTY

		What goes on up at Lover's Lane?

				JENNIFER

			(turning toward her)

		What do you mean?

				BETTY

		Well, you hear all these things lately.

		You know--kids spending so much time up

		there ...

			(she looks over)

		Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?

				JENNIFER

		Yeah ...

			(beat)

		That--and ...

	She stops herself.

				BETTY

		What?

				JENNIFER

		It doesn't matter.

				BETTY

		No. I want to know.

				JENNIFER

			(glances toward the living room/

			lowers her voice)

		... Sex.

				BETTY

		Ah.

	Betty nods from the import of the tone but not the meaning. A

	beat goes by ...

				BETTY (CONT)

		What's sex?

	Jennifer looks over at her stunned, but Betty just looks at

	her with a blank, curious expression. Jennifer hesitates.

				JENNIFER

		You sure you want to know this?

				BETTY

		Yes.

				JENNIFER

		Okay.

	She crosses to the kitchen door and closes it. The sounds of

	the TV in the living room disappear. Jennifer crosses back to

	the kitchen counter and turns to her.

				JENNIFER (CONT)

		You see Mom ...

			(softer and with understanding)

		When two people like each other very

		much ...

	Betty looks at her and nods ...

								DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. PARKER HOUSE. NIGHT.

	The TV keeps flickering in the window.

	INT. KITCHEN. LATER ...

	The CAMERA PANS across the kitchen table where there is a

	full quart of milk and some uneaten co6kies. It finally comes

	to rest on Jennifer who is staring across the kitchen table

	with a concerned look on her face.

				JENNIFER

		You okay?

	REVERSE ANGLE. BETTY.

	She nods--shaken but "fine." Betty stares long and hard at

	the plate of chocolate chip cookies. She's far away.

				BETTY

		Yes ...

			(softly)

		It's just that ...

				JENNIFER

			(gently)

		What?

				BETTY

		Well ...

			(looking up)

		... Your father would never do anything

		like that.

	SHOT. JENNIFER.

	She bites her lip weighing her next sentence ...

				JENNIFER

			(leaning forward)

		Oh. Hmm ...

			(whisper/

			woman to woman)

		Well, Mom ... there's ways to "enjoy"

		yourself without Dad.

	ANGLE. BETTY.

	She looks across the table, perplexed.

								CUT TO:

	INT. PARKER BEDROOM. NIGHT.

	George crosses from the dresser to the TWO TWIN BEDS in the

	middle of the room. He wears long sleeve pajamas that are

	buttoned up to the neck. George puts his glass of warm milk

	on the nightstand and climbs in his own single bed. It is

	barely wide enough for his body and takes some maneuvering.

				GEORGE

		Sweetie? You coming to bed?

	There is no answer.

				GEORGE (CONT)

		Betty?

	INT. BATHROOM.

	She stands in her bathrobe staring down at the tub. Her

	dressing gown is buttoned to the neck as well.

				BETTY

			(calling out)

		Yeah ... I'm just going to take a bath

		first.

	CLOSER. BETTY.

	She swallows once as she stares down at the tub--then reaches

	for the spigot and turns on the water. Betty's heart beats a

	little faster as she HEARS the WATER THUNDERING DOWN.

	CLOSER STILL ...

	Betty reaches up and unties the little silk ribbon at the top

	of her robe. She slips it off, and lets it drop to the floor,

	standing naked in the middle of the bathroom. Betty glances

	toward the mirror and then quickly glances away. She takes a

	deep breath and steps into the tub.

	EVEN TIGHTER. ON HER FACE ...

	Betty slides down into the warm water, breathing in the

	steam, and closing her eyes for a moment. She lingers like

	that for a second or two, before settling a little lower in

	the tub. Betty opens her eyes, but they only half open. There

	is the slight trace of a smile.

	EXTREME CLOSE UP BETTY'S FACE.

	Her eyes close again as she bites her lower lip gently. The

	water continues to THUNDER DOWN as she arches her back.

	Betty's breathing seems to quicken as she opens her eyes all

	over again:

	HER POV. BATHROOM ...

	ALL AT ONCE, EVERYTHING AROUND STARTS TO TURN FROM BLACK AND

	WHITE TO COLOR. A BIRD OUT THE WINDOW BECOMES A RED BREASTED

	ROBIN. THE TILE ON THE TUB TURNS OUT TO BE PURPLE. GREEN

	TOWEL ... PINK ROBE ... BRIGHT YELLOW DAISIES ON THE PLASTIC

	SHOWER CURTAIN.

	CLOSE UP. BETTY'S FACE.

	She stares in amazment. Beads of sweat form on Betty's

	forehead as the world goes to TECHNICOLOR. The THUNDERING

	WATER POUNDS IN THE BACKGROUND, but beneath can be heard the

	beginnings of a faint, low, MOAN. Her eyes dart around the

	room. Her breathing quickens: Faster ... Harder ... More

	intense ... THEN SUDDENLY ...

	EXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT.

	The HUGE ELM TREE across the street suddenly BURSTS INTO

	FLAMES. Fire shoots straight up into the sky as billowing

	clouds of black smoke fill the air. BRIGHT ORANGE FLAMES

	LIGHT UP THE NIGHT.

	INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.

	David is staring at the television set when he notices a

	weird orange glow. He glances behind him, out the living room

	window ...

				DAVID

		Oh my God!

	EXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT.

	David comes racing out of the front door and down the walk. A

	small CROWD has gathered in front of the fire. (They don't

	seem frightened--just sort of amazed.) The street is still

	BLACK AND WHITE but it is now bathed in a weird ORANGE LIGHT.

	The flames leap higher and higher ...

				DAVID

		Jesus Christ ...

	FOLLOWING DAVID.

	He takes off down the block, as fast as he can run. The crowd

	continues to stare as David turns the corner at Main

	Street ...

	EXT. FIRE STATION.

	He races in the front of the building SCREAMING at the top of

	his lungs.

				DAVID

		FIRE! FIRE!

	INT. FIRE STATION.

	There is no sign of life on the ground floor. David races up

	the stairs toward the bunk room on the second story.

	INT. BUNKROOM.

	All the firemen are sitting around playing Gin Rummy when

	David rushes in the front door. They can hear his voice from

	down the hall.

				DAVID

			(entering)

		FIRE ... FIRE ...

	They still don't move. All the firemen just look at him from

	their bunks with a perplexed expression.

				DAVID (CONT)

			(beat)

		CAT!!!

	All at once they spring to their feet grabbing their helmets

	and their yellow slickers. They race to the landing just

	outside the bunkroom and leap onto the pole ...

	EXT. MAIN STREET. NIGHT.

	The FIRE HAS SPREAD TO AN ADJOINING TREE as the FIRE ENGINE

	comes SCREAMING toward the house from the top of the block.

	David sits in the front of the truck next to the Fire Chief

	who drives the vehicle at break neck speed.

				DAVID

		Right here!

	The Fire ENGINE screeches to a halt. The Fire Chief looks

	around ...

				FIRE CHIEF

		Where is it?

	David shoots him a look then glances at the inferno. He

	shakes his head and leaps from the truck.

	FOLLOWING DAVID.

	He races around to the back where the other firemen are

	standing just as confused. David grabs one of the hoses and

	begins to pull it from the truck.

				DAVID

		Here! Grab this nozzle.

				FIREMAN

		But where's the ...

				DAVID

		Just grab it!

	He strips out about fifteen feet of hose, then grabs the

	fireman and pulls him toward the curb. David parts the crowd

	and positions the man right in front of the flames.

				DAVID (CONT)

			(shouting)

		Okay! Now point this right at the

		flames--like this.

	The Fireman nods and does as he is told. David opens the

	valve sending out a huge FLUME OF WATER.

				FIREMAN

		Whoa!

			(beat)

		So that's what these do.

	A huge smile breaks out across the fireman's face--like a man

	who has suddenly found his purpose in life. He beams from ear

	to ear dousing the flames, while David runs to get another

	hose ...

				BOB (VO)

			(fading in)

		... In honor and in recognition of

		your heroism ...

								DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. TOWN HALL. DAY

	David stands at a podium receiving a commendation from "Big"

	Bob McGee (the man from the barbershop). He holds a large

	plaque up for public display, while "David's" whole family

	beams in the background.

				BOB

		... And with great appreciation from

		the citizens of Pleasantville ...

	WIDER.

	A huge crowd is gathered on the town hall steps. There are

	lots of balloons and bunting.

				BOB

		I am pleased to present You with this

		special commendation, from the

		Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce!

	He hands the plaque to David as the entire town bursts into

	APPLAUSE.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. MAIN STREET. LATER ...

	David walks away from the center of town looking down at his

	plaque. He takes his sleeve and starts to rub off a smudge

	when a young woman comes up beside him.

				GIRL'S VOICE

		Hi Bud ...

	WIDER.

	She is MARGARET ANNE HENDERSON, the prettiest girl in school,

	and one of the most popular. Margaret wears a frilly polka

	dot dress, that only accentuates a bombshell '50s figure.

	Nonetheless, she seems the image of girly innocence.

				MARGARET

		That was sure swell ...

				DAVID

		Oh. Thanks, Margaret.

				MARGARET

			(smiling)

		I baked you my oatmeal cookies.

				DAVID

			(vaguely remembering an episode)

		Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.

				MARGARET

		No. I baked them for you.

				DAVID

		No. You baked them for Whitey.

				MARGARET

			(low and gutteral)

		No. I baked them for you.

	All at once, Margaret grabs his arm and presses herself up

	against him. Her breasts shove up against his chest. Her

	mouth is inches away from his.

				DAVID

		Um ... thanks.

	David can smell the weird combination of hot moist breath and

	freshly baked cookies. He stares into her eyes for a moment,

	unable to speak. Margaret flashes him a not-so Pleasantville

	smile.

				MARGARET

		See ya.

	She turns and heads around the comer, while David just

	watches her dumbstruck.

								CUT TO:

	SODA SHOP. DUSK.

	David heads toward work with his apron and little paper hat.

	The BUDDY HOLLY music has given way to "hip" '50s JAZZ. DAVE

	BRUBECK drifts out of the soda shop as David pauses for a

	moment, takes a bite of his oatmeal cookie, and heads inside.

	SODA SHOP.

	The place has "morphed" even more. If it was a teenage

	hangout before, it has become almost a Bohemian coffee house

	now. Brubeck's "TAKE FIVE" plays in the background while

	several patrons talk "intensely" in their booths.

	DOORWAY.

	David walks into the building and pauses. Next to him, one of

	the boys from the basketball team plays along with the jazz

	on a BONGO DRUM. There are several COFFEE cups on the table.

	Jennifer gets up quickly and comes over to him.

				JENNIFER

			(in a whisper)

		I had nothing to do with that fire.

				DAVID

			(quietly)

		It's okay.

				JENNIFER

		Not directly anyhow ...

				DAVID

		It's fine.

	David glances at the booth beside them and realizes that the

	bongos have stopped playing. All the kids are staring up at

	him, with a weird expression of awe.

				JENNIFER

			(still under her breath)

		Um ... They like wanna ask you a

		question ... I didn't know how to

		handle it. So ...

				DAVID

		Sure.

	He crosses to the booth where Biff and two others look up at

	him. It's like Elvis has entered the building.

				DAVID (CONT)

		How you doin?

				VARIOUS KIDS

		Swell ...

	They keep on staring. Several glances are exchanged back and

	forth like they're sharing a secret. Finally ...

				BOY

		How'd you know about the fire?

				DAVID

		What?

				BOY

		How'd you know how to put it out and

		all?

	David hesitates, weighing his words.

				DAVID

		Well--where I used to live ...

		That's just what firemen did.

	This sends a MURMUR through the shop. The boy leans forward.

				BOY

		And where's that?

				DAVID

			(carefully)

		Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.

	This sends a much LOUDER MURMUR rifling through the kids.

	It's like electricity. They glance excited at one another. A

	hush descends.

				BOY

		What's outside of Pleasantville?

				DAVID

		Look it doesn't matter. It's not

		important.

				BOY

		What is it?

	David stops and looks out at the kids who are hanging on

	every word.

				DAVID

		It's really not important.

				GIRL'S VOICE (OS)

		What's outside of Pleasantville?

	REVERSE ANGLE. INCLUDING DOORWAY.

	Margaret Henderson (the girl with the cookies) stands in the

	doorway staring at David. She hangs on his words with the

	same excitement as the others, it just means so much more.

				MARGARET (CONT)

			(hungry for knowledge)

		C'mon. Tell us ...

	She stares right in his eyes. She's ten feet away but might

	as well be touching him.

				DAVID

			(slowly)

		Well ... There are some places where

		the road doesn't go in a circle.

		There are some places where it keeps

		on going.

	There's an excited giggle. They lean forward.

				MARGARET

			(an exotic concept)

		Keeps going ...

				DAVID

		Well--it all just keeps going.

		Roads ... rivers ...

				2ND BOY

			(from the back)

		Like the "Mighty Mississippi".

				DAVID

		... What?

	He moves forward extending a book. The cover reads: "THE

	ADVENTURES OF HUCKELBERRY FINN." David opens the first page.

	There is printing inside.

				BOY

			(quoting)

		"It was big 'n brown 'n kept goin'

		an' goin' as far you could see."

				DAVID

			(turning to Jennifer)

		I thought the books were blank?

				JENNIFER

		They were.

	He looks over at her.

				JENNIFER (CONT)

			(quickly)

		Okay look, this like--wasn't my fault.

		They asked me what it was about and I

		like didn't remember 'cause we had it

		back in tenth grade, But I told them

		what I DID remember, and the next

		thing I knew the pages had filled in.

				DAVID

		The pages filled in?

				JENNIFER

		But like only up to the part about

		the raft, because I didn't read any

		farther.

	CLOSER.

	David flips through the book and sure enough only the first

	chapter has print. The pages are blank after that.

				2ND BOY 

		Do you know how it ends?

				DAVID

			(hesitating)

		Well, yeah ... I do.

				MARGARET

			(breathless)

		So how does it end?

	She has moved closer and is gazing at him from a couple of

	feet away. It's silent in the soda shop.

				DAVID

		Well--see ... they're both running

		away--Huck and the slave ... And ...

		They go up the river ... But--in

		trying to get free they sort of see

		that they're free already.

	David looks immediately down to the blank pages of the book

	that aren't blank anymore. Rows and rows of FRESH NEW TYPE

	materialize in front of him. He turns to the back of the

	book, that is complete with a COLOR illustration.

				DAVID (CONT)

			(quietly)

		Oh my God.

				2ND BOY

		Wow!

				3RD BOY

		Do you know this one?

	He shoves another book in front of David.

				DAVID

		Hunh?

			(looks down at the book)

		Oh yeah ... Well this is great.

			(beat)

		See--Holden Caulfield is like this

		really lonely kid...

	EXT. PLEASANTVILLE PUBLIC LIBRARY. DAY.

	The CAMERA PANS down from the "PUBLIC LIBRARY' sign to find

	the front door. A long line of kids waiting to check out

	their books stretches onto the sidewalk ...

	EXTREME WIDE SHOT. LIBRARY. FROM ACROSS THE STREET.

	Several men from the barbershop lean against the wall next to

	the spinning barber pole. They watch the spectacle for a

	moment or two, as teenager after teenager exits with an

	armful of books.

				GUS

		I don't know Phil. It's pretty strange.

				PHIL

		I'll say it's strange. Gettin' stranger.

	Big Bob McGee nods and rubs his hands over his fresh haircut.

				PHIL (CONT)

		I mean goin' up to that lake all the

		time is one thing, but now they're

		going to a library! I mean what's next?

				BURT

		Oughtta be havin' an ice cream soda.

		That's where they oughtta be.

	WIDER STILL.

	From the shadows of the Town Hall, up the block, David

	watches the stream of kids emerge with their books. They

	cradle them in their hands like a piece of newfound

	treasure ...

	INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.

	George sits on the edge of his Barka Lounger, across the

	coffee table from "Big" Bob McGee. Even sitting down the man

	is a looming presence. Besides owning the market, auto

	dealership, hardware store, and gas station, he also owns the

	insurance agency where George works. George sweats into his

	collar.

				GEORGE

		Want some bridge mix?

				BOB

		Oh, no thanks ...

				GEORGE

		Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...

				BOB

		I'm fine--but thank you.

	George nods as Bob takes a belt of his Martini and leans

	forward.

				BOB (CONT)

		George, you're probably wondering why

		I asked if I could come over today ...

	George shrugs--then nods--then shrugs ...

				BOB (CONT)

		I'm sure you've noticed the same

		things we all have--certain "changes"

		going on in the town.

			(beat)

		You know what I mean by "changes"?

				GEORGE

		"Changes."

				BOB

			(nodding)

		"Changes."

			(takes a belt of martini)

		And it's not just the fire or big

		stuff like that. It's little things.

			(beat)

		Did you hear about Bill Miller?

				GEORGE

			(concerned)

		No. What?

				BOB

		Wife wants him to get one of those

		new beds.

				GEORGE

		One of those ... big beds?

	Bob nods.

				GEORGE (CONT)

		Oh my gosh. What's he gonna to do?

				BOB

		I really don't know.

			(beat)

		Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a

		boxboy at the market.

				GEORGE

		... How?

				BIG BOB

		Said he didn't want to do it anymore.

		Just took off his apron in the middle

		of an order. Mrs. Thompson had her

		groceries spread all over the counter

		... Took 'em four hours to sort the

		whole thing out.

				GEORGE

		Holy cow.

	Bob takes a belt of his drink ...

				BIG BOB

		George, everyone likes you.

				GEORGE

		Oh well ...

				BOB

		No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause

		you're a great bowler ... They respect

		you ...

				GEORGE

			(heartfelt)

		Thank you very much.

				BOB

		And it's important for them to see

		someone they respect, stand up for

		what's right. If you love a place,

		you can't sit around and watch this

		kind of thing happen to it.

				GEORGE

		No. Of course not.

				BOB

			(big patriarchal smile)

		And that's why I want you to be on

		the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.

				GEORGE

			(stunned/

			moved)

		Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.

				BOB

			(smiling)

		Why don't you start by saying "yes,"

		and then getting me one of those swell

		pineapple kabobs.

				GEORGE

		Oh sure ... You bet.

			(calling out)

		Betty ...

	There is no answer.

				GEORGE (CONT)

			(louder this time)

		BETTY ...

	Still no answer.

				GEORGE (CONT)

		BETTY--BOB WANTS TO TRY ONE OF YOUR

		GREAT HORS D'OEUVRES ...

	WIDER.

	George turns around to see David, standing on the landing,

	listening to the entire conversation. Their eyes lock for a

	moment ...

				DAVID

		I'll get her.

	He moves quickly to the kitchen shutting the door behind him.

	INT. KITCHEN.

	David gets a couple of steps in and stops. He looks across

	the room to see:

	REVERSE ANGLE.

	Betty standing at the kitchen sink, just staring out the

	window. Her back is to him. She grips the formica kitchen

	counter.

				DAVID

			(approaching slowly)

		Are you okay?

	She doesn't answer. David moves up to her and rests a hand on

	her shoulder.

				DAVID (CONT)

		Are you alright?

	Betty turns around to face him. HER FACE HAS TURNED

	COMPLETELY TO COLOR. THE EYES ARE GREEN. THE LIPS ARE RED.

	SHE HAS A NATURAL BLUSH IN HER CHEEKS. In fact the whole

	thing looks like a beautiful color portrait except for the

	tear stains on either side of her face.

				BETTY

			(fighting tears)

		What am I going to do?

	David moves closer and looks at her. Her lip is quivering.

				DAVID

		It's okay. It's alright.

				BETTY

			(trembling)

		I can't go out there. How can I go out

		there?

	She looks right up at David.

				BETTY (CONT)

			(quieter)

		Look at me ...

	DIFFERENT ANGLE.

	He stares at her for a second. Big green eyes full of fear

	and confusion. David pushes a reassuring smile.

				DAVID

		Have you got any make up?

				BETTY

		In my handbag.

	He crosses to the counter and grabs her purse. David sits

	Betty on a kitchen chair and fishes inside the handbag for

	her compact. He finds it along with a wadded up Kleenex.

				DAVID

		Okay--first we'll dry you out a little.

	He dabs at the tears, while she smiles at him in gratitude,

	Then David opens the compact and takes out the large GRAY

	powder puff.

	CLOSER.

	It is a truly amazing sight. As David smears on the makeup,

	she returns gradually to BLACK AND WHITE. The skin tones

	disappear. The flush of her cheeks goes. David takes out a

	DARK GRAY lipstick, obliterating the bright red of her lips.

	REVERSE ANGLE. OVER BETTY'S SHOULDER.

	He works on her for a second or two, then takes a step back.

	All at once, David seems to wince:

	REVERSE ANGLE. HIS POV. BETTY'S FACE.

	The life is gone from her face. In an instant Betty has gone

	from three dimensions to two. She stands in front of him, the

	fictional version of herself all over again.

				BETTY

			(off his reaction)

		What?

	David shakes his head and forces a smile. He hands her the

	compact so she can examine herself. Betty holds it up to her

	face, turning her head first right, then left.

				BETTY (CONT)

			(beat)

		Does it look okay?

				DAVID

		Looks just like it did.

				BETTY

		And they won't be able to tell?

				DAVID

			(even quieter)

		No ... They won't be able to tell.

	Betty takes a deep breath and fluffs her hair. She grabs the

	plate of Pineapple kabobs and heads for the door. Just before

	she goes in, she pauses, then plasters on a big wide

	"stewardess" smile ...

				DAVID (CONT)

		Wait.

				BETTY

			(turning back)

		What?

	He wants to say something, but doesn't. David shakes his

	head.

				DAVID

		It's fine.

	She smiles again and balances the tray in front of her.

				BETTY

		Thank you.

				DAVID

			(sadly)

		Sure.

	He watches as she opens the door, and marches in the room,

	extending the little tray of hors d'oeuvres in front of

	her ...

								CUT TO:

	INT. SODA SHOP. DAY.

	Mr. Johnson is all alone in the shop, setting up the napkin

	dispensers. He whistles BRUBECK'S "TAKE FIVE" when the screen

	door slams behind him. Mr. Johnson looks up with a start.

				MR. JOHNSON

		Oh, hi.

				DAVID

			(entering)

		Hi.

				MR. JOHNSON

		Aren't you a little early?

				DAVID

			(quietly)

		I brought you something ... From the

		library.

	CLOSER. FOLLOWING DAVID.

	He has a large book tucked under his arm that is easily three

	feet long. Mr. Johnson looks at him a little intrigued as

	David crosses to the counter.

				DAVID

		It's an art book.

				MR. JOHNSON

		Oh my Gosh, Bud ...

				DAVID

		Open it.

	Mr. Johnson reaches out and opens the cover. After a beat,

	his eyes widen.

				DAVID (CONT)

		I just thought since you liked

		painting it might help to ...

	Mr. Johnson gasps. It's quiet, and subtle, but it's still a

	gasp. David looks over at him but he's lost in the pages.

	HIS POV. (INSERT) ART BOOK ...

	Massacio's "Expulsion of Adam and Eve' leaps off the pages in

	vibrant, tortured color. The beauty of the garden is offset

	by their agony and their shame. HE TURNS THE PAGE ...

	Titian's "Venus to Utano". Soft, fleshy, in a rich golden

	light. She is utterly real and entirely nude. The folds of

	her flesh almost seem to glow ...

	Rembrandt's "Self Portrait." Dark reds, umbers, blacks and

	browns. He looks back at Mr. Johnson with pain and wisdom.

	There's a brilliant light on his hair.

				MR. JOHNSON (OS)

		Mmmmgh ...

	Faintly, almost imperceptibly, the SOUND of a rich ARIA

	begins to UNDERSCORE THE IMAGES. It's so faint you can't be

	sure you even hear it at all ... like you're hearing it with

	your eyes.

	He TURNS THE PAGES faster. Breugal's "Harvesters" ... Tumees

	"Steam Train" ... Monet's "Cathedralo" ... Cezanne's

	"Oranges" ... Mr. Johnson shuts the book.

	WIDER. SODA SHOP.

	They sit like that for a beat.

				MR. JOHNSON

		It's beautiful, Bud ...

	He looks up at David, troubled.

				DAVID

		What's wrong?

				MR. JOHNSON

		I'll never be able to do that.

				DAVID

		Oh, well--you're just starting out.

		I mean, you can't do it ...

				MR. JOHNSON

		No, that's not it.

	Mr. Johnson shuts the book gently.

				MR. JOHNSON (CONT)

		Where am I going to see colors like

		that?

	ANGLE. DAVID.

	What can he say. David looks over at Mr. Johnson who just

	smiles and shrugs.

				MR. JOHNSON

		Must be awfully lucky to see colors

		like that. I bet they don't even know

		how lucky they are.

	CLOSE UP. DAVID.

	He just stares for a second.

	EXT. MAIN STREET. LONG SHOT. DAY.

	Margaret walks up the center of Main Street toward the CAMERA

	with her books pressed against her chest. She passes the

	drugstore, then the hardware store ... Far off in the

	distance, a young man comes racing out of the soda shop,

	pulling off his little paper hat as he goes. He comes running

	up behind her as fast as he can.

	CLOSER.

	He takes a deep breath and tries to quiet the panting.

				DAVID

		Hi.

				MARGARET

			(turning/

			lighting up)

		Oh ... Hi.

				DAVID

			(pause)

		Look, I probably shouldn't be asking

		you this--not knowing you that well

		and all ...

	Margaret stops in the street and turns to him.

				DAVID (CONT)

		It's just that my folks are gonna

		stay home and they said I could use

		their car.

			(moment of truth/

			abandoning his speech)

		... You want to go out with me

		tonight?

	He wants to turn away but doesn't. David forces himself to

	stare at her and all of a sudden she beams. It's the whitest,

	pearliest smile in the world.

				MARGARET

			(breathless)

		Sure ... Where would we go?

				DAVID

			(swallows)

		... Lover's Lane?

								CUT TO:

	EXT. ELM STREET. DAY.

	David comes flying around the corner in complete jubilation.

	He vaults over a parking meter, swings around a lampost and

	leaps off the bumper of a parked car. David hi-fives into the

	air at no one in particular and sails over Mr. Simpson's

	hedge almost decking him in the process.

				DAVID

			(calling back)

		Sorry ...

	FOLLOWING DAVID.

	He races across the street bobbing and weaving like an All

	American fullback. David bounds up his front steps two at a

	time flinging open the door.

	INT. PARKER HOUSE. FOYER.

				DAVID

		"Oh when the Saints ... Go Marching

		in ..."

	He lets the door slam behind him as he takes off his apron

	and tosses it on the coat rack. David starts up the stairs,

	when he HEARS a MAN'S VOICE coming from the living room.

				MAN'S VOICE (OS)

		Bud ...

	He pauses a second and glances back.

				MAN'S VOICE (CONT)

		David ...

	He peers into the living room. David goes a little grayer ...

	HIS POV. TELEVISION.

	Dick Van Dyke is looking back at him from the middle of the

	TV screen. He seems to have a bit of a stubble.

				DICK VAN DYKE

		Hello there.

				DAVID

			(wary)

		... Hi.

				DICK VAN DYKE

			(stage whisper)

		Well c'mere, young fella.

	INT. LIVING ROOM.

	David crosses slowly over to the TV set.

				DICK VAN DYKE

			(big smile)

		You know I've been thinkin' ... I

		might have been a little "hasty"

		the other day when you asked to come

		home--just took me by such surprise,

		ya know--ha ha ...

	He gives a goony laugh. David just looks at him ...

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)

		So even though I can't make any

		promises, well--I figured if you

		asked me real nice--I might just be

		willing to talk about it again.

				DAVID

			(quickly)

		I can't.

				DICK VAN DYKE

		What?

				DAVID

		Talk about it. Right now, I mean.

		I got to ... um ...

	The look turns suddenly dark and ominous.

				DICK VAN DYKE

		Bud--I thought you wanted to come

		home.

				DAVID

		Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I

		told my "dad" I'd clean out the

		rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted

		me to ... to change the tape in the

		register ...

				DICK VAN DYKE

			(getting testy)

		I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm

		getting sorta concerned about what

		I'm seeing in some of these

		re-runs ...

				DAVID

		Re-runs?

				DICK VAN DYKE

		Like when Margaret Henderson makes

		her cookies for Whitey.

			(losing it a little)

		... Those aren't your cookies Bud.

				DAVID

		Oh, I know they're not. But I mean--

		they're just "cookies" after all ...

				DICK VAN DYKE

		Excuse me?

				DAVID

		Well they're not just cookies. I

		mean, they're great cookies ...

		Look, I'd love to get into this

		whole thing but I'm really running

		late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?

				DICK VAN DYKE

		BUD.

				DAVID

		Terrific. I'll talk to you then.

	He swttches off the TV sending Dick Van Dyke to electronic

	limbo. David stands in the middle of the living room,

	breathing hard ...

	INT. JENNIFER'S (MARY SUE'S) ROOM.

	She sits on the bed staring down at the front cover of a

	book. (It's an alien experience.) Jennifer is just about to

	open it when she senses something and glances toward the

	door.

	REVERSE ANGLE.

	Bud is standing in the doorway just staring at her. He seems

	to be out of breath.

				JENNIFER

		What's wrong?

				DAVID

		Nothing.

				JENNIFER

		Nothing?

	He keeps breathing hard in the doorway. David holds the

	remote in his hand.

				DAVID

		Listen ...

	He takes a couple of steps into the room and then suddenly

	stops.

				DAVID (CONT)

		You're reading?

				JENNIFER

			(glancing at the book)

		Yeah. Can't believe you started such

		a dorky fad.

	She holds up the cover.

				JENNIFER (CONT)

		D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?

				DAVID

			(amazed)

		... Yeah.

				JENNIFER

		Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35

		pages.

				DAVID

			(still stunned)

		That's great.

	He just stares at her for a second as his mind seems to

	drift ...

				JENNIFER

		So what is it?

				DAVID

		Well ... I just ...

			(out of the blue)

		Can I ask you a question?

				JENNIFER

		Sure.

				DAVID

		Remember when you told me that Lisa

		Rosenberg liked me?

				JENNIFER

		Yeah ...

				DAVID

		Well--did she really like me or were

		you just making that up.

				JENNIFER

		No. She really liked you.

				DAVID

		You weren't playing a joke? She

		woulda gone out with me?

				JENNIFER

		Gone out with you. She woulda like

		rearranged your tonsils.

				DAVID

		Wow.

	He looks at her amazed--reliving the missed opportunity.

				JENNIFER

		Can I ask you a question?

				DAVID

		Yes.

				JENNIFER

		How come I'm still in black and white?

				DAVID

			(back to earth)

		What?

				JENNIFER

		Well I've had like ten times as

		much sex as these girls and I'm

		still like this. They have one hour

		in the back of a car and suddenly

		they're in technicolor.

				DAVID

		Oh, I don't know. Maybe ...

			(thinks)

		... it's not just the sex ...

				JENNIFER

			(looking up quickly)

		What?

	She stares at him wide-eyed like someone who has just heard

	their name called. Jennifer's eyes dart around like she's

	calculating a math problem. After a moment or two, her

	expression changes: a vague look of recognition.

				JENNIFER (CONT)

		No, it's not just the sex, is it?

	She glances down at her book. It's a big book. Jennifer takes

	a deep breath and stares at the gray skin of her hand. After

	a second or two, she looks back. David looks at her for a

	beat ...

								CUT TO:

	EXT. MARGARET HENDERSON'S HOUSE. (MAPLE STREET) DAY.

	David gets out of his "dad's" convertible, carrying a dozen

	"gray" roses. He takes a deep breath and heads up her front

	walk ...

	INT. CAR. NIGHT. LATER ...

	David sits behind the wheel of the borrowed car with Margaret

	Henderson by his side. He concentrates hard on the road,

	holding the wheel at "10 and 2" as he steals a glance to his

	right.

	HIS POV. MARGARET.

	It's not quite evening yet, and late afternoon light makes

	her glow. Margaret smiles as she turns her face into the warm

	wind that swirls inside the convertible ...

	SHOT. DAVID.

	He studies her for a moment or two, then suddenly swerves to

	avoid a parked car on his right ...

	WIDER.

	They pass a sign with a happy family on it that reads:

	"NOW LEAVING PLEASANTVILLE"

	Main Street turns into a winding country road as they leave

	the town behind and head off into the woods. They wind

	through the dense woodland for a moment or two before a

	second sign appears, much like the first:

	"NOW ENTERING PLEASANTVILLE"

	DIFFERENT ANGLE. THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.

	Sure enough, the town emerges in front of them again,

	completing the 4 dimensional circle. David looks confused.

				MARGARET

		Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.

				DAVID

		Oh ... Right.

	He looks over at her and smiles. Margaret turns on the radio.

	EXT. CAR. DUSK.

	SAM COOKE sings for them as David turns from Main Street onto

	a smaller unmarked lane. The car starts to rise up a small

	hill, with Dogwood trees blooming on either side of the road.

	It continues to climb up the narrow gravel lane toward the

	crest in the hill. David looks over at Margaret who takes a

	deep breath shutting her eyes. He glances down at the seat

	between them ...

	HIS POV. CAR SEAT.

	THE ROSES THAT WERE GRAY HAVE SUDDENLY TURNED TO COLOR. They

	sit next to him on the seat: a deep, rich RED ...

	INT. CAR.

	David looks up and out the windshield. The same thing seems

	to be happening around them ... Many of the Dogwoods have

	started to turn PINK. Not all of them, but at least fifty

	percent of the petals have "bloomed" in some weird false

	spring. The road twists and turns on its way to the top, as

	they finally reach a crest in the hill.

				DAVID

		Wow.

	THEIR POV. LOVERS LANE.

	There, sitting in front of them, is a whole world gone

	Technicolor: THE LAKE IS BLUER THAN BLUE. THE WEEPING WILLOW

	IS GREENER THAN GREEN. THE DOGWOOD PETALS (all "turned" now)

	SWIRL IN THE WIND LIKE SOME STRANGE PINK SNOWSTORM. A LONG

	LINE OF PASTEL CARS STRETCHES OUT ALONG THE SHORE.

				SAM COOKE (VO)

			(over the car radios)

		"Cupid, draw back your bow ..."

	SHOT. CAR.

	Slowly, David rolls the convertible forward. Many of the kids

	have left their cars and sit down along the grassy bank by

	the edge of the water. A few of them have books open. It

	almost looks "Athenian."

	INT. CAR.

	David looks at the whole scene for a moment then suddenly

	cocks his head to the side.

				DAVID

		What's that smell?

	Margaret looks at him and smiles. She leans well out of the

	convertible, and plucks a Gardenia from a bush that is

	blooming beside the car.

				MARGARET

		Aren't these great?

	David takes the flower, then puts it up to his nose. He takes

	a long deep breath then all at once, his posture seems to

	relax. As the fragrance enters his body his eyes drift like

	some strange narcotic is washing over him. David lowers the

	flower ...

	EXT. MAIN STREET. DUSK.

	Betty is walking down Main Street with a shopping bag on

	either hand. From a block away, she looks like any other

	homemaker in Pleasantville. You don't even notice the gray

	make-up.

	CLOSER. FOLLOWING BETTY.

	She nods to Mrs. Filmore in the bakery and smiles at Don in

	the Post Office. Betty is just about to turn on Elm Street

	when she glances up, and suddenly stops.

	HER POV. ACROSS THE STREET.

	There, in the middle of the block, sits Mr. Johnson's soda

	shop. The whole scene is still black and white, except for

	the large CUBIST PAINTING THAT FILLS MR. JOHNSON'S WINDOW. It

	is rendered in bright PINKS, YELLOWS AND ORANGES, and looks

	like a Braque or a Picasso except for the unusual subject

	matter. Upon closer examination you see that all the spheres

	and cones add up to an avante garde snow scene, with a Cubist

	Santa hovering over the roof tops.

	SHOT. BETTY.

	She stares at it, mesmerized for a moment, then starts to

	wander across the street. It's late afternoon and the

	business district is empty. Betty crosses in the middle of

	the block, staring straight ahead.

	INT. SODA SHOP.

	The door opens and she sticks her head inside. Most of the

	place is dark except for one streak of sunlight shining

	through the window near the back of the store. Betty glances

	around. The little bell JINGLES as she enters.

				MR. JOHNSON (OS)

		We're closed right now ...

	DIFFERENT ANGLE.

	He sits in front of a small easel near the back, staring at a

	board which doubles as a canvas. Mr. Johnson glances over his

	shoulder and recognizes Betty in the doorway.

				MR. JOHNSON

		Oh, hi ...

				BETTY

			(turning to leave)

		I'm sorry ...

				MR. JOHNSON

		No, no ... Come on in.

	REVERSE ANGLE.

	He gets up from his stool and crosses toward the door, still

	holding the palette in his hand. Betty stares at the "Cubist

	Christmas" in the window.

				BETTY

		I just thought ... It's beautiful.

				MR. JOHNSON

		Thanks.

	Their eyes lock for a second. Sort of a clutzy silence. Mr.

	Johnson motions toward his easel.

				MR. JOHNSON (CONT)

		I was just trying to do one of these

		"still lifes."

	He sighs and looks behind him. Next to the easel is a bowl of

	GRAY FRUIT.

				MR. JOHNSON (CONT)

		Having kind of a tough time.

				BETTY

		I think it looks nice.

				MR. JOHNSON

		Well ...

			(shrugs)

		Here's what it's s'posed to look like.

	He leads her over to the table and points down at the art

	book. It's open to a Cezanne that nearly burns off the page.

				BETTY

		Oh my ...

	CLOSER.

	They are standing almost on top of each other gazing down at

	the book. Neither one of them moves. Betty almost disappears

	into the pictures--drawn by a strange new world.

				MR. JOHNSON

		Here. Look at this.

	He turns to Kandinsky--a massive swirl of color. The image is

	nearly electric.

				BETTY

			(breathless)

		Where'd you get this?

				MR. JOHNSON

		Bud brought it to me.

				BETTY

		Bud?

				MR. JOHNSON

		Here's my favorite.

	INSERT. BOOK.

	He turns the page near the back to one of Picasso's "Weeping

	Women." The woman is rendered in pink and red and green. Her

	head is a large sphere, laying "peacefully" on her own

	shoulder.

				MR. JOHNSON

		What do you think?

	She doesn't answer ...

				MR. JOHNSON (CONT)

		Isn't it great how she's resting like

		that?

				BETTY

			(faintly)

		She's crying.

	WIDER.

	Mr. Johnson looks down at the painting.

				MR. JOHNSON

		What?

				BETTY

		She's crying.

				MR. JOHNSON

		No she's not.

				BETTY

		Yes she is.

	He looks up at her ...

	REVERSE ANGLE.

	A single tear is running down Betty's cheek. She senses it

	and reaches up to wipe it quickly away, but instead of just

	wiping the tear, she takes off a huge swath of GRAY MAKE-UP.

	A long strip of PINK FLESH is revealed underneath.

	ANGLE. MR. JOHNSON.

	He stares up at her in amazement.

	ANGLE. BETTY.

	She senses something and glances down at her hand. Her

	fingertips are covered in GRAY MAKE-UP. Betty turns and bolts

	for the door.

	WIDER.

				MR. JOHNSON

			(following her)

		Wait ...

				BETTY

		I've got to go ...

				MR. JOHNSON

		It's alright.

	He stops her near the door and she turns her face toward the

	wall. Mr. Johnson touches her shoulder.

				MR. JOHNSON (CONT)

		It's alright. Let me see.

				BETTY

			(shame)

		No ...

	He reaches up and gently touches her chin. Mr. Johnson moves

	around to glimpse the other side of her cheek.

				MR. JOHNSON

		It's beautiful.

	CLOSER ...

	She freezes like that for a moment, then slowly, haltingly,

	turns toward him. THE COLOR of her real flesh is revealed

	underneath. Betty stands there exposed.

				MR. JOHNSON

			(a whisper)

		... It's beautiful.

	She swallows, not sure what to do. Betty glances down.

				MR. JOHNSON (CONT)

		You shouldn't cover that up.

	Mr. Johnson reaches over to the little napkin dispenser on

	the counter and pulls one out. He leans forward and dabs at

	the tears beneath Betty's eyes. Then slowly, gently, he

	starts to wipe the makeup off her cheek.

	CLOSER STILL ...

	She recoils a bit, tensing up, then just looks at him. Mr.

	Johnson is gazing at her "true color" with wonder and

	acceptance. She hesitates for an instant, then seems to make

	a decision. Betty slowly turns her face to the side, exposing

	her flesh all the way down to the neck. Mr. Johnson continues

	to wipe off the make up in larger and larger strokes as the

	beautiful pink flesh begins to emerge ...

								CUT TO:

	INT. JENNIFER'S (MARY SUE'S) ROOM. NIGHT.

	She lies on her bed, reading the same book she was browsing

	earlier. Jennifer seems strangely engrossed as she flips the

	pages, lying on her stomach, scouring every word. After a

	moment or two she gets restless and shifts position, lifting

	the book. The cover is plainly visible: "LADY CHATTERLY'S

	LOVER."

	CLOSER.

	She doesn't have enough light so Jennifer rises from the bed

	and crosses to "her" desk. She sits in the chair and flattens

	the book in front of her. Jennifer is deep into the plot and

	doesn't even look up as she flicks on the desk lamp. She

	could almost be studying algebra as she sits upright at the

	little desk.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE.

	She flips the page and peers more intently. Her hair is

	bothering her so she pulls it back and knots it in a pony

	tail. After a little while her eyes begin to get more tired

	and she looks up and blinks a couple of times. Jennifer

	notices something across the desk.

	REVERSE ANGLE.

	A pair of Mary Sue's glasses are neatly folded in front of

	her. Jennifer reaches out, puts them on her head, glances

	back down at the print.

				JENNIFER

			(impressed)

		Hunh.

	She can see much clearer now. Jennifer folds her hands in

	front of her and doesn't even realize that she has mimicked

	the PHOTOGRAPH OF MARY SUE THAT SITS BESIDE HER IN A SILVER

	FRAME. The face is the same, but that's to be expected. So is

	the pony tail, the glasses, the posture and the studious look

	on her face. Jennifer turns the page engrossed in her novel

	when there is a loud TAP on the window.

	She rises from the desk and pulls back the curtain. Jennifer

	slides open the window.

	EXT. PARKER HOUSE.

	Biff stands on the front lawn tossing pebbles at the window.

				BIFF

		Mary Sue--C'mon ...

				JENNIFER

			(leaning out the window)

		What are you doing?

				BIFF

			(jiggling in anticipation)

		It's six-thirty ...

				JENNIFER

		So.

				BIFF

		We were gonna ... You know ...

	He jiggles some more.

				JENNIFER

		Oh.

			(remembering)

		I can't.

				BIFF

		Why not?

	She glances down at her book.

				JENNIFER

		I'm busy.

				BIFF

			(surprised)

		With what?

	INT. JENNIFER'S ROOM.

	She hesitates for a second then glances back at the desk. Her

	own image in the silver frame stares back at her. The hair is

	pulled back in a pony tail. The glasses sit on the front of

	her nose.

				JENNIFER

			(turning to Biff)

		I'm studying.

	She thinks about it for a moment, then suddenly smiles. Biff

	stands dumbfounded on the sidewalk as Jennifer reaches up and

	quietly closes the window ...

								CUT TO:

	EXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT.

	David and Margaret sit on the edge of the grass, looking out

	across the water. Even in the moonlight, the COLORS are

	vivid. David still clutches the gardenia in his hand, taking

	a long hit like an Opium addict.

				DAVID

			(inhaling)

		Mmmmgh.

				MARGARET

		Do they have those ... Where you come

		from?

				DAVID

		Yeah ... I guess.

			(beat)

		I don't know.

				MARGARET

		You don't know?

	Margaret laughs like that isn't even possible. She shifts on

	the grass hiking her skirt up above the knee. It reveals a

	long tan leg beneath it. David watches as she kicks off her

	shoes, rubbing her feet through the long cool grass.

				MARGARET (CONT)

		So what's it like?

				DAVID

		What?

				MARGARET

			(a whisper)

		Out there.

	She clings onto the words like they could transport her by

	themselves. David thinks for a moment.

				DAVID

		Oh. don't know ... It's different.

	She leans forward.

				MARGARET

		How?

				DAVID

		Well it's louder ... And scarier I

		guess ... And ... and a lot more

		dangerous ...

				MARGARET

		Sounds fantastic. You know some kids

		came up here the other night to go

		swimming--took off all their clothes.

	She giggles. David looks at her in amazement.

				MARGARET (CONT)

		Do they have an Ocean? I've heard

		about the ocean.

				DAVID

		Yeah.

				MARGARET

		What's that like?

				DAVID

		Well it's big. And it's blue ...

			(as if realizing it for the first time)

		... It's really really blue.

				MARGARET

		Mmmm.

			(beat)

		Boy. It's hot up here.

	Suddenly and without warning Margaret unbuttons her cardigan

	sweater. She slips it off, arching her back like the

	figurehead of a ship and David just stares at her breasts.

	She wears a light cotton blouse and even in the moonlight it

	forms a translucent silhouette ... She lays the sweater

	across the grass and leans back on it.

				MARGARET (CONT)

		You want some berries?

				DAVID

		Hunh?

	She unfolds a handkerchief revealing a handful of berries in

	REDS AND BLUES AND PURPLES.

				MARGARET

		I picked them myself. They grow wild

		up here.

			(eating one)

		Mmm. So sweet.

				DAVID

			(looking at them)

		They just grow like that?

				MARGARET

			(looking straight up)

		Oh yeah. There's a lot of stuff.

		Currants and strawberries ... Here.

		I'll show you.

	She hops up and scampers across the grassy bank, kicking her

	heels behind her. Margaret reaches a tree in the distance and

	reaches toward an upper limb, stretching out her body like a

	piece of statuary. She picks a piece of fruit and scampers

	back toward him, hiking up her skirt as she goes ...

				MARGARET (CONT)

		Here.

	CLOSER.

	Margaret sticks out her hand, offering him a BRIGHT RED

	APPLE. It's brilliant and shiny and glistens in the

	moonlight.

	ANGLE. DAVID.

	He hesitates just looking at it. Margaret speaks in a

	whisper.

				MARGARET

		Go on. Try it.

	HIS POV.

	She is lying on her stomach now, and behind the outstretched

	apple he can see an ample view of her cleavage. Margaret is

	smiling at him as the apple shines in the foreground. David

	reaches out and takes it.

	WIDER. DAVID AND MARGARET.

	For this instant, they seem alone in the garden. He looks

	down at it, then glances over at Margaret. David hesitates

	for a split second then takes a bite of the apple ...

								CUT TO:

	EXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT.

	George heads home with his briefcase in hand whistling a

	happy tune. He smiles at Mr. Simpson and swings the attache

	case as he turns and heads up his front walk.

	INT. FOYER.

	George opens the door and sets the briefcase by the stairs

	like he always does. He hangs his hat on the hatrack, his

	coat on the coatrack, and beams as he hollers his nightly

	greeting:

				GEORGE

		Honey--I'm home.

	There is no response. He looks a little perplexed but smiles

	as he calls out again:

				GEORGE (CONT)

		Honey--I'm home ...

	There is more silence. George looks around a little confused

	when there is a BOOMING CLAP OF THUNDER ...

								CUT TO:

	INT. SODA SHOP. NIGHT.

	Betty sits in a comer of the shop, next to the gray bowl of

	fruit. She holds her head to the side, sitting gracefully

	with her chin in the air. Mr. Johnson sits behind his easel,

	painting her portrait from a few feet away. Betty looks

	radiant with no trace of the makeup, the warm PINK OF HER

	FLESH TONES lit softly by a bare forty watt bulb ...

	CLOSER.

	She looks over at Mr. Johnson when they hear the BOOMING CLAP

	OF THUNDER. Each of them freezes. There is ANOTHER, LOUDER

	BOOM ...

	ANGLE. WINDOW.

	The "Cubist Snowscene" lights up brightly, illuminated by the

	sudden flash of lightning behind it. Betty leaps up from the

	chair and crosses to the window looking out.

				BETTY

			(frightened)

		What is that?

				MR. JOHNSON

		I don't know.

	Betty looks back at Mr. Johnson and suddenly sees the

	painting. She flinches for a second. Her eyes go wide.

	REVERSE ANGLE. INCLUDING THE PAINTING.

	It is Cubist (like the rest of his recent work) but that

	isn't the shocking part. Even though she sits in front of him

	fully clothed, Mr. Johnson has painted a beautiful, sensual

	nude. Betty just stares at the canvas, stunned to see herself

	revealed like that. The COLORS are all hot pinks and oranges

	and yellows--like some Fauvist celebration of summertime.

	There is another even LOUDER PEEL OF THUNDER.

	WIDER. BETTY AND MR. JOHNSON.

	She looks over at Mr. Johnson and he glances down. After a

	moment or two he looks back at her, but she doesn't turn to

	run. Betty just stares at him, then without even realizing

	it, moves slightly closer.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT.

	David and Margaret are locked in a deep passionate kiss. At

	first they don't separate when they hear the BOOMING CLAP OF

	THUNDER. It is only when they hear the SECOND ONE and the

	RAIN starts to fall, that Margaret pulls back and looks up in

	the sky.

				MARGARET

		What is that?

	ANGLE. DAVID.

	He is still in an amorous daze and doesn't even feel the

	increasing rain. It starts to pound harder and Margaret looks

	to him in terror.

				MARGARET

		What's going on?

				DAVID

		Rain.

				MARGARET

		Real rain?

				DAVID

		Yeah ... You don't have rain either?

	She looks at him frightened. David smiles.

				DAVID (CONT)

		Right. Of course you don't ...

	He puts his jacket around her and starts to lead her up the

	grassy slope. A dozen other couples go scurrying up the bank,

	looking in terror at the water falling from the sky.

				MARGARET

		What do we do?

				DAVID

			(reaching the car)

		We'll just put up the top.

	He goes fishing around the boot of the car, looking for the

	catch to release it. David leans into the back seat fishing

	around as the rain starts to pound harder.

				MARGARET

		What top?

	He looks back at her. No top either. David smiles, drenched

	in rain and puts his arm around Margaret who is starting to

	shiver.

				DAVID

		It's fine. Come on.

	He leads her back to a thicket of bushes where several of the

	kids are clustered together. They look at one another,

	terrified, as they huddle for shelter beneath the ledge of an

	overhanging rock.

				DAVID (CONT)

		It's alright. There's nothing to be

		afraid of.

	They look a little reassured and Margaret looks up at him

	positively adoringly. She clings to his shoulder as the storm

	howls a few feet away ...

								CUT TO:

	INT. JENNIFER'S ROOM. NIGHT.

	She stands at the window looking out at the driving rain.

	Jennifer still holds the D.H. Lawrence book in her hand.

	There is a huge flash of lightning and another clap of

	thunder.

				JENNIFER

		Cool ...

	She flops back down on the bed and continues to read ...

	PARKER LIVING ROOM.

	George wanders through the empty and darkened house

	completely perplexed and utterly disoriented. He looks around

	for his family, but all he can find are the darkened rooms

	and the sound of the driving storm.

				GEORGE

			(a little frightened/

			a little petulant)

		Honey, I'm home ...

	He still can't find her and he crosses into the DINING ROOM.

	The lights are dark there as well and he looks around

	confused.

				GEORGE (CONT)

			(baffled)

		Where's my dinner?

	He sniffs a couple of times but there are no familiar cooking

	smells. George flings open the door to the kitchen but that's

	empty as well.

	KITCHEN.

	He crosses into the darkness ...

				GEORGE

		Where's my dinner ...

	INT. FOYER.

	George comes reeling out of the kitchen into the foyer. He

	slams his shin on the coatrack but keeps on going ...

				GEORGE

			(insistent)

		Where's my DINNER ...

	EXT. HOUSE.

	It's really blowing now. The rain is coming down in heavy

	sheets, being swirled and driven by the wind. The front door

	opens and George wanders out onto the front porch, still

	dressed in his shirtsleeves.

				GEORGE

		Where's my DINNER!

	ON GEORGE.

	He stumbles down the front walk in a state of complete

	confusion. The rain pounds against his body and within

	seconds his shirt is soaked through to the skin.

				GEORGE

			(over the storm)

		WHERE'S MY DINNER ...

	EXT. ELM STREET.

	A tree limb crashes to the ground but he keeps stumbling

	through the torrent. George reels down Elm Street screaming

	skyward in the distance.

				GEORGE

		... WHERE'S MY DINNER! WHERE'S MY

		DINNER!

	SERIES OF SHOTS. FOLLOWING GEORGE ...

	He turns on Main Street and goes reeling past the insurance

	agency where he works. George howls into the wind and he

	passes the hardware store, the gas station, the bakery ...

	Finally he pauses outside the barbershop. It's empty as well

	with the spinning barber pole being buffeted by the rain.

	George lowers his arms and just stares into the darkened

	shop. His voice grows quieter bewildered and shivering ...

				GEORGE

			(plaintively)

		Where's my dinner?

	He wraps his arms around himself and shivers on the sidewalk.

	INT. BOWLING ALLEY. NIGHT.

	The regular occupants of the barber shop spread out across

	three lanes. Each wears a Pleasantville bowling shirt,

	sponsored by one of Big Bob's businesses.

	The NOISE from the crashing pins is deafening and there

	aren't any windows so the storm has gone unnoticed ...

	ANGLE. BIG BOB.

	He picks up a 7-10 split and claps his hands in delight. He

	starts to cross back to the scorer's table when he looks up

	and suddenly stops.

	REVERSE ANGLE. HIS POV.

	George is standing in the doorway to the bowling alley cold

	and shivering. His shirt is soaked through to the skin. His

	hair is drenched and dripping.

				BOB

		What happened?

	He doesn't answer. George clutches his body and keeps

	shivering.

	WIDER.

	The men stop bowling and rush to George's side. He blinks a

	couple of times, still soaked to the bone.

				BOB

		Are you alright?

			(looking at him)

		What is it?

				GEORGE

			(faintly)

		Rain.

				BOB

			(beat)

		Real rain?

	George nods. Bob rushes to the glass door of the bowling

	alley and sees the driving storm. A huge fork of lightning

	lights up the sky.

				BOB (CONT)

		Oh my God ...

	He turns back to George.

				BOB (CONT)

		... We had no idea. Burt was rolling

		a 250 and ...

			(beat)

		Are you alright?

	George shivers and Bobs leads him over to one of the benches

	and guides him into the seat ...

				BOB (CONT)

		What happened?

				GEORGE

			(still shivering)

		Well, I ... I came home like I always

		do, And I came in the front door. And

		I took off my coat. And I put down my

		briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home."

	ANGLE. MEN.

	They all nod in recognition.

	ANGLE. GEORGE.

				GEORGE

		... Only no one was there.

	A MURMUR goes through the men.

				GEORGE (CONT)

		So I went into the kitchen and I

		yelled it again. "Honey--I'm home."

		But there was no one there either.

		No wife. No lights. No dinner.

	They all GASP.

				GEORGE (CONT)

		So I went to the oven--you know--

		because I thought maybe she had made

		me one of those "TV dinners ..."

	The men nod and lean forward. George shakes his head.

				GEORGE (CONT)

		But she hadn't. She was gone.

	A LOUDER MURMUR moves through the crowd. George lowers his

	head and just shakes it from side to side. Big Bob moves up

	and puts a hand on his shoulder.

				BOB

			(gently/

			the patriarch)

		... It's gonna be fine George.

	George looks up at him helplessly. Bob pats him reassuringly

	on the back.

				GUS

		What do we do Bob?

				BOB

		Well--we'll be safe for now--thank

		goodness we're in a bowling alley--

		but if George here doesn't get his

		dinner, any one of us could be next.

		It could be you Gus, or you Burt, or

		even you Phil ...

	They murmur again. Bob gathers a little steam.

				BOB (CONT)

			(like a WWII movie)

		... That's real rain out there

		gentlemen. This isn't some little

		"virus" that's going to "clear up on

		it's own." There's something

		happening to our town and I think we

		can all see where it comes from.

	They nod in agreement.

				BOB (CONT)

		We're gonna need a town meeting.

		Phil, how fast can you turn around

		a leaflet in your print shop?

				PHIL

		Couple of hours.

				BOB

		Gus, why don't you get a bunch of

		kids from the basketball team to help

		you put them up on lamposts and tree

		trunks ...

	Gus nods. Big Bob turns to George and smiles. It's a warm,

	patriarchal smile. He claps a hand on George's shoulder.

				BOB (CONT)

			(soothingly)

		And the first thing you're gonna do

		is get a cup of hot cocoa and a nice

		dry bowling shirt.

	INT. SODA SHOP. NIGHT.

	The rain still pounds out the window. Betty and Mr. Johnson

	are huddled in one of the booths watching the deluge through

	Mr. Johnson's snow scene in the window. Betty is in soft

	radiant color now. Almost the whole frame seems to glow

	pink ...

				MR. JOHNSON

		You can't go out there.

				BETTY

		But I really should get home.

				MR. JOHNSON

		But you can't go out there.

	There is another fork of lightning and a booming peel of

	THUNDER. Betty sighs. She's past struggling. Betty shuts her

	eyes for a moment and listens to the rain pounding on the

	roof.

				BETTY

		Sounds nice ... Once you get used

		to it.

				MR. JOHNSON

			(listening)

		Yeah. It does.

	There is another flash and a loud BOOM. Betty smiles this

	time.

				BETTY

		Like a drum.

				MR. JOHNSON

		Yeah.

			(thinks)

		Or like sprinklers in the summer ...

	Betty smiles. They both listen for a moment and the fear

	seems to fade a little. The RAIN POUNDS harder on the roof as

	Betty nestles down in the booth, a little closer to Mr.

	Johnson. They just sit there listening for a moment or two.

	Betty starts to smile ...

	EXT. LOVER'S LANE.

	David huddles with Margaret under the rocky ledge as she

	nestles against him with her head on his shoulder.

	INT. JENNIFER'S ROOM.

	She lies on her bed, still reading the book, the spitting

	image of Mary Sue. Her hair is up in a bun now. The glasses

	have slipped down her nose. There is another fork of

	lightning and the LOUDEST THUNDER CLAP of all. Jennifer

	smiles slightly and pulls Mary Sue's afghan over her

	shoulders as she fluffs the pillow and turns the page.

								CUT TO:

	CLOSE UP. A BRIGHT RED ROSE.

	Drops of moisture cling to the petals as it GLEAMS BRILLIANT

	RED IN THE MORNING SUN ...

	AERIAL SHOT. PLEASANTVILLE.

	The rain is gone now. The town glistens in the sunlight

	complete with a huge RAINBOW arching across the sky.

	Literally all the COLORS IN THE RAINBOW shine against the

	black and white of the town. It looks like a greeting card.

	INT. SODA SHOP.

	Betty and Mr. Johnson are asleep in the booth, lying in each

	other's arms. Sunlight streams in through the window, warming

	Mr. Johnson's face which has now turned to color. He opens

	his eyes and looks outside ...

				MR. JOHNSON

			(seeing the rainbow)

		Oh my Gosh ...

	EXT. LOVER'S LANE.

	Birds are chirping. David and Margaret also lie asleep in

	each other's arms, beneath the shelter of the rocky overhang.

	Margaret lifts up and sees the rainbow. She has turned to

	color as well ...

				MARGARET

			(awed)

		Oh my God ...

	INT. JENNIFER'S ROOM.

	She has passed out on her bed with her book on her chest.

	Jennifer's hair is still tied in a bun and she still wears

	Mary Sue's glasses, but her face has returned to its rosy

	pink hue. She blinks open her eyes, feeling the sunlight, and

	looks out the window.

				JENNIFER

			(looking at the rainbow)

		Oh my God ...

	INT. BOWLING ALLEY.

	The men are all passed out across the various lanes and

	scoring tables. It looks like a YMCA shelter. After a moment

	or two Big Bob yawns, and stretches, and glances out the

	glass doorway. He sees the rainbow and freezes in shock.

				BOB

			(horrified)

		Oh my GOD!

								CUT TO:

	EXT. ELM ST. DAY.

	David comes gliding up Maple Street in the sunshine with a

	huge smile on his face. He has that special grin and faraway

	look that a boy only knows once in his life. Perplexingly he

	is still in black and white. Bud turns on Elm Street and

	starts heading for his house when he glances up and suddenly

	freezes.

	HIS POV. TREE TRUNK.

	There, tacked to the bark, is a hastily scrawled public

	notice:

	TOWN MEETING TONIGHT

	ALL "TRUE" CITIZENS

	OF PLEASANTVILLE

	ANGLE. DAVID.

	He looks up at it for a moment.

	INT. PARKER KITCHEN. DUSK.

	George and Betty stand face to face in their suburban

	kitchen. He is black and white. She is in full color.

				BETTY

		I told you where I was.

				GEORGE

		All night?

				BETTY

		I got caught in the storm. You were

		gone all night too.

				GEORGE

			(the ultimate defense)

		I was in a bowling-alley.

	Betty turns--glances out the window.

				GEORGE (CONT)

			(sudden smile)

		Look. Let's just forget about it.

		Let's just go to the meeting and ...

				BETTY

		I told you, George. I'm not going.

				GEORGE

			(bigger smile)

		Sure you are.

				BETTY

		No I'm not.

	She turns to face him. George flinches slightly.

				BETTY (CONT)

		Look at me George. That meeting's not

		for me. Look at my face.

				GEORGE

		It's fine. You'll put on some make up

		and ...

				BETTY

		I don't want to put on some make up ...

	George's eyes widen. It's a watershed moment.

				GEORGE

			(protesting)

		It goes away ... It'll go away.

				BETTY

			(gently)

		I don't want it to go away.

	He suddenly squares back his shoulders and puffs out his

	chest.

				GEORGE

			(the '50s patriarch)

		Okay--now you listen to me ...

			(beat)

		You're gonna come to this meeting and

		you're gonna put on this make up, and

		you're gonna come home at six o'clock

		every night and have dinner ready on

		this table.

				BETTY

			(softly)

		No I'm not sweetie.

	His expression leaves as quickly as it came. Betty moves

	closer to him.

				BETTY (CONT)

			(half whisper)

		... There's a meatloaf in the fridge.

		You just put it in the oven and turn

		this little knob up to three-fifty.

		If you put the pie in forty minutes

		later, it'll be hot in time for

		dessert.

	George's eyes widen.

				BETTY (CONT)

		I made a couple of lunches for you

		and put them in brown paper bags ...

			(much quieter)

		I'm gonna go now.

				GEORGE

		Where are you gonna go?

				BETTY

		I'm gonna go now.

	She turns and starts out the kitchen door when George calls

	after her.

				GEORGE

		Betty, don't go out there like that!

		They'll see you!

			(beat)

		They'll SEE you!

	And she closes the door behind her.

				GEORGE (CONT)

		Betty, come back here!

	EXT. TOWN HALL. NIGHT.

	Dozens of black and white citizens stream in through the

	front door.

	SHOT. OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET.

	Several "transformed" teenagers stare at the spectacle with

	their FLESH COLORED SKIN AND BRIGHT BLUE EYES. They seem to

	hang back in the shadows.

	INT. TOWN HALL.

	Big Bob stands at the podium beneath a permanent banner that

	reads "PLEASANTVILLE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE." As the only

	legally constituted body in Pleasantville, it is a natural

	place for a town meeting. There is nothing bright and cheery

	however. The floor lamps in each comer cast huge, looming

	shadows up the walls. The light at the podium bathes Big

	Bob's face in a blinding splash of light. The whole thing

	evokes some weird twisted image from German Expressionism--

	like they are about to go look for Frankenstein. It is grayer

	than gray.

	CLOSER. PODIUM.

	Big Bob stands at a lectern with a Rotary insignia on the

	front. He speaks calmly but compellingly to a hundred men and

	women who hang on his every word. Bob holds a BRIGHT YELLOW

	GRAPEFRUIT.

				BOB

		This was found over in Dave Murphy's

		trash can. There were four of them

		like this ...

	There is a murmur from the crowd ...

	CLOSE UP. GEORGE.

	He sits up on the stage in an honored position right behind

	Bob. George wears a shiny new ROTARY PIN in his lapel, as a

	full-fledged member of the Chamber of Commerce. He sits stoic

	and upright with the sense of safety and reassurance that a

	shiny new pin can give you.

	SHOT. BOB.

	He holds up a pair of BRIGHT RED BOXER SHORTS.

				BOB

		Jane Davidson found these in her

		son's laundry basket.

	There is a LOUDER MURMUR. The crowd shifts in their seats.

	Bob points behind him to a BRIGHT GREEN lawn chair.

				BOB (CONT)

		This is from Mary Petersen's front

		porch. She found one last week.

		There were two more this morning ...

	The MURMUR starts to grow ...

								CUT TO:

	EXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT.

	David and Margaret stand beneath the big Elm tree outside

	Margaret's house: a statue of two young lovers. They wrap

	their arms around each other in a classic silhouette. The

	meeting across town seems a million miles away. After a

	moment or two, David reaches behind the tree and pulls out a

	beautifully wrapped gift. It is three feet long with a bright

	RED bow.

				DAVID

			(softly)

		I got you something.

	Margaret's eyes widen. She beams at him, then tears off the

	wrapping paper revealing a great big umbrella ... a real

	umbrella. She looks up at him thrilled.

				MARGARET

		It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?

				DAVID

		It was a prop for the school play ...

	She looks down and giggles.

				MARGARET

		Can I open it?

				DAVID

		Sure ...

	Margaret gives him a quick kiss then opens the umbrella. She

	puts it back on her shoulder and turns a series of

	pirouettes--like her own kind of rain dance. Margaret points

	her face up to the sky as if she is being showered by a

	summer storm. All at once a pair of HEADLIGHTS round the

	corner.

	WIDER.

	David grabs the umbrella and closes it quickly. Margaret

	looks to the street as the convertible slows to a crawl and

	two TEENAGE BOYS pull up beside them. They are clean cut with

	BLACK AND WHITE faces ...

				DRIVER

		Hello Bud ...

				DAVID

			(clipped)

		Hello Whitey.

	They smile at each other for no good reason. It's scary and

	arrogant.

				WHITEY

			(more pointed)

		Hello Margaret.

				MARGARET

		Hello Whitey ...

				WHITEY

			(loud)

		Hey Bud, how come you're not at

		the town meeting right now?

				DAVID

			(curt)

		No reason.

			(pause/

			firing back)

		How come you're not?

				WHITEY

		Oh. We're s'posed to go out and

		let everybody know about it. See.

	He points to an ARMBAND that has some sort of Chamber of

	Commerce seal on it. Whitey leans out of the car and

	leers ...

				WHITEY (CONT)

		No reason hunh ... See I thought

		maybe it was cause you were too

		busy entertaining your colored

		girlfriend.

	Margaret literally flinches. The boys share a PEEL OF

	LAUGHTER AND SNORT AT EACH OTHER. David puts an arm around

	her and pulls her close.

				DAVID

		Why don't you guys just get the

		hell out of here.

				WHITEY

		Oh, okay, Bud. We'll do that.

	He guns the engine as if to leave, then pauses and turns

	toward Margaret.

				WHITEY (CONT)

			(leering more)

		You know Margaret, you can come

		over and bake those Oatmeal cookies

		for me anytime you want to.

	They share another CHORTLE as Whitey guns the car and peels

	out with a SCREECH. Margaret's lip starts to quiver and David

	holds her tighter ...

				DAVID

		It's fine ... It doesn't mean anything.

	She nods, groping for reassurance ...

								CUT TO:

	INT. TOWN HALL. NIGHT.

	The chamber of commerce meeting is still in full swing.

	Various citizens are now on their feet, screaming from the

	audience.

				WOMAN

		Ed McFadden's got a blue front door.

				ED MCFADDEN

		It's always been blue!

				WOMAN

		Not that blue!

				MAN

		There's a big tree turning orange

		in Joe Baker's front yard!

	SHOT. GEORGE.

	He still sits behind Bob with the same stoic expression on

	his face. George fingers the little pin in his lapel ...

				BOB

		People, people ... I think we all

		know what's going on here.

	SHOT. BOB.

	Bob lifts his hands in the air. The crowd quiets down a bit.

				BOB

		Obviously certain "changes" have

		been happening. Up until now, things

		in Pleasantville have always been--

		well ... "Pleasant." And, recently,

		certain things have become ...

		"Un-Pleasant." Now it seems to me

		the first thing we have to do is to

		separate out the things that are

		pleasant, from the things that are

		"Un-Pleasant."

	There is a loud murmur and nod of agreement ...

				BOB (CONT)

		George, why don't you and Burt

		take the lead on this. Why don't

		you put together kind of an

		"Un-Pleasant" Activities Committee ...

								CUT TO:

	INT. SODA SHOP. NIGHT.

	Mr. Johnson has scrubbed the snow scene from the window and

	stares with his palette at a blank pane of glass. There is a

	knock at the door ...

	WIDER.

	Mr. Johnson puts down the paints and crosses to open it.

	Betty is standing in the doorway clutching her purse and a

	"Lady Samsonite Weekender" bag. She stares up into his eyes.

								DISSOLVE TO:

	FULL SHOT. SHOP WINDOW. MORNING.

	Burt Campbell opens up the hardware store like he does every

	morning, only today there is a slight difference. He swings

	open the door, puts out the rakes and shovels, then sets a

	newly handwritten sign clearly in the front window:

	"NO COLOREDS"

	SERIES OF SHOTS. SHOP WINDOWS.

	As the businesses are opened on Main Street, more and more

	"NO COLOREDS" signs appear in the windows: next to the

	donuts ... by fishing poles ... beside the stationery

	supplies ... Everything else looks frighteningly the same...

								CUT TO:

	EXT. MAIN STREET. DAY.

	Joey Anderson, the local paper boy, is finishing his morning

	rounds. He reaches in his bag and tosses left toward the

	bakery. Then he throws right toward the post office. Then he

	turns left toward the soda shop, does a double take and slams

	into a trash can ...

	WIDER. SODA SHOP.

	Where Mr. Johnson had once painted his cubist snow scene,

	there is a brand new painting that isn't cubist at all. A

	NUDE version of Betty graces the shop window--painted in

	curving sensual brush strokes. Joey stops his bike and just

	stares in amazement. He gets up and rides away as fast as he

	possibly can ...

								CUT TO:

	MAIN STREET. LATER ...

	David is in a happy daze, wandering up Main Street and

	doesn't even notice the crowd gathered outside Mr. Johnson's

	soda shop. After a moment or two, he glances up and sees the

	window ...

	CLOSER. DAVID.

	His eyes go wide. The murmur of the crowd grows louder as

	stray derisive comments rise above the noise. David glances

	from the nude in window to the growing angry mob ...

	MAIN STREET. DAY.

	David goes tearing through the business district looking for

	any sign of his "mother." He glances in the flower shop ...

	toward the green grocer ... David is just about to turn on

	Elm Street when a booming voice seems to come from the

	sky ...

				DICK VAN DYKE (OS)

		Bud ...

	David stops and looks to his right. There, in the window of

	the Philco TV store, are twenty screens of various sizes

	displaying the image of Dick Van Dyke.

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)

		I want a word with you ...

				DAVID

			(scared)

		Oh--well ...

				DICK VAN DYKE

			(BOOMING)

		NOW!

	The sound reverberates like God Himself. David ducks inside

	the store, slamming the door behind him.

	INT. STORE.

	Fifty Dick Van Dyke's stare at him from every TV in the

	store. The effect is smothering.

				DICK VAN DYKE

			(still pretty loud)

		What the hell do you think you're

		doing!

	David glances around, not sure where to look.

				DAVID

			(terrified)

		What do you mean?

				DICK VAN DYKE

		What do I MEAN!

			(beat)

		You think this is a toy? You think

		it's your own little goddamn

		coloring book ...

				DAVID

		Look--it just sort of "happened" ...

				DICK VAN DYKE

		A deluge doesn't just "happen."

		Bolts of lightning don't just

		"happen" ...

			(louder)

		You burned down an ELM tree for

		Christ's sake ...

				DAVID

		I had nothing to do with that.

				DICK VAN DYKE

		Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory.

		What episode does the orgy happen

		in, again?

				DAVID

		Look ...

				DICK VAN DYKE

		It was a gift Bud. It was so

		special. You liked these things

		as much as I did, remember:

		Warm smells in the family kitchen?

		A smile from a stranger? You know

		how rare that is?

				DAVID

			(beat/

			quietly)

		... Only if they mean it.

	Dick Van Dyke looks at him for a beat, then goes "red" in the

	face.

				DICK VAN DYKE

		OKAY. NOW YOU'RE REALLY STARTING

		TO PISS ME OFF!

				DAVID

			(finding courage)

		I didn't do anything wrong.

				DICK VAN DYKE

		Oh no? Let me show you something!

	SHOT. TV SCREEN.

	All at once a box appears in the upper right hand comer of

	the screen containing the image of David and Margaret at

	Lover's Lane. The VIDEOTAPE rolls forward as she extends the

	BRIGHT RED APPLE. David hesitates, then takes it, then puts

	it to his mouth and takes a bite.

				DICK VAN DYKE

		"YOU DON'T DESERVE THIS PLACE."

	The image of David biting the apple PLAYS BACKWARDS AND

	FORWARDS like some football instant replay ...

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)

		YOU DON'T DESERVE TO LIVE IN THIS

		PARADISE!

	WIDER.

	David just stares at the repeated images of Dick Van Dyke on

	the TV screens.

				DICK VAN DYKE

			(quickly)

		Where's the remote control I gave

		you?

				DAVID

		Why?

				DICK VAN DYKE

		Because you're coming home. I'm

		gonna put this place back the way

		it was.

				DAVID

		No you're not.

				DICK VAN DYKE

		EXCUSE ME?

				DAVID

			(gathering strength)

		I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.

				DICK VAN DYKE

			(nuts)

		JUST GIMME THE GODDAMN REMOTE!

	He lunges toward the screen and slams his hand against the

	"barrier."

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)

		OW!

				DAVID

			(terrified)

		I'm going to leave now.

				DICK VAN DYKE

		You're not going anywhere. You're

		gonna get that remote and you're

		gonna come home and we're gonna

		make everybody HAPPY AGAIN!!!

	Dick Van Dyke looks at him stunned as David turns and leaves

	the shop.

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)

		Don't make me get rough with you!

		I can get awfully fucking rough!

	ELM STREET. DAY.

	David sprints down the tree lined street toward his house.

	The leaves on some of the trees are starting to turn GREEN

	even this far into town. David vaults over Mr. Simpson's

	hedge and goes tearing up his front walk.

	INT. FOYER.

	The door flies open and he rushes in, breathless. David

	glances around the house to make sure that it is empty. He

	crosses into the living room.

	INT. LIVING ROOM.

	David rushes to the TV and grabs the remote. He looks down at

	it, glances at the television, then bolts for the front door.

	MAIN STREET. DAY.

	David moves quickly down Main Street looking for a place to

	stash the remote. He pauses in front of the Pleasantville

	Travel Agency. It has posters in the window depicting various

	destinations in and around Pleasantville (the place doesn't

	see much business). David bends down to stash the remote in a

	drain pipe near the entrance when he hears VOICES from up the

	street.

	WIDER.

	David turns to see a small crowd up near the end of Main

	Street. He sticks the remote in the drain pipe and rises to

	his feet as the voices get louder.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE.

	The crowd is moving toward him. A woman walks in front of a

	group of young men who circle around her, taunting and

	harassing her. A moment later David can make out the face:

	BETTY clutches her handbag to her chest while the crowd

	circles her like a pack of dogs.

	CLOSER. BETTY.

	The ROSY HUE of her face stands out in stark relief to the

	black and white faces around her. Betty holds her head high

	with dignity (and fear) while the ugly epithets overlap one

	another "Oooh--let's see the rest of you ... Let's see what's

	under that nice blue dress ... Bet she's even pinker than her

	picture ..." One of the boys yanks at Betty's skirt and she

	quickens her pace. Just at that moment the boy is shoved to

	the ground ...

	WIDER.

	David shields his "mother" as he shoves one of the boys into

	the dirt. The kid gets up but David punches him hard in the

	side of the jaw and the rest of them just stare. (Violence is

	as new as anything else and it seems to freeze the moment.)

	David steps in front of his "mother" with both fists

	clenched.

				DAVID

			(as scared as she is)

		Come on!

	He plants his back foot primed for action. The crowd of black

	and white thugs just stares at it.

				DAVID (CONT)

		COME ON!

	ANGLE. CROWD.

	They look at him warily. The boy reaches up and feels the

	side of his mouth where a trickle of RED BLOOD is running

	down his chin. He looks at his finger in horror and starts

	backing away.

				DAVID

		Get out of here!

	They back away further and David takes a threatening step.

	The boys turn and run as he turns back to face his "mother."

	DIFFERENT ANGLE. BETTY. (OVER DAVID'S SHOULDER)

	David moves up to her gently.

				DAVID

		Are you alright?

	She nods, still clutching her purse to her chest. David

	reaches out and touches her cheek when suddenly her eyes go

	wide.

				DAVID (CONT)

			(off her look)

		What?

	CLOSER. STILL OVER DAVID'S SHOULDER.

	Betty reaches into her purse and pulls out her compact. She

	opens it, and holds it up to David, showing him the reflected

	image of his own face. AT LAST HE HAS TURNED TO COLOR.

	REVERSE ANGLE. DAVID.

	He holds the mirror staring at his own reflection. The

	courage which transformed him only seems to grow. They look

	at each other, both in color now, when David puts a gentle

	arm around her shoulder.

				DAVID

			(quietly)

		Come on.

	He begins to lead her up toward the corner.

								CUT TO:

	FULL SHOT. SODA SHOP WINDOW. DAY.

	A larger crowd of hooligans has now gathered around the nude

	painting of Betty in the window. The jeers and cat calls are

	even louder. The "closed" sign still sits in the doorway.

	After a beat or two, a HUGE BRICK SHATTERS THE GLASS ...

	WIDER.

	A big CHEER goes up from the crowd. Drunk on adrenalin, the

	fever builds and ANOTHER BRICK SMASHES THE WINDOW. In an

	instant, Mr. Johnson's "canvas" is totally destroyed. The

	CHEERING grows louder ...

	Almost by osmosis, the crowd rushes the building together.

	The door is kicked in and they stream into the place. Soon

	all that can be heard is the weird SOUND OF LAUGHTER AND

	BROKEN GLASS.

	INT. SODA SHOP.

	It is an orgy of destruction. Stools are hurled--tables

	ripped out. The cash register is turned over. Two boys kick

	in the front of the juke box ...

	EXT. MAIN ST. DAY.

	David and Betty round the corner to find the Soda Shop being

	destroyed. They stand at the far side of the intersection

	watching the carnage as the crowd continues to run amok.

	After a moment or two, there are some more HOOTS as MARGARET

	comes running toward them with the front of her blouse ripped

	open.

				DAVID

		Oh my God.

	He takes her in his arms and Margaret starts to sob. David

	strokes her hair.

				DAVID (CONT)

		Are you alright? Are you okay?

	She nods. Margaret catches her breath for a moment or two,

	then glances down to her side ...

	WIDER.

	She is clutching the umbrella in her left hand. The thing has

	been ripped to shreds. The spines are broken and the fabric

	is torn. Margaret stares at the thing with a combination of

	confusion and shame. David goes white with rage and looks

	toward the mob.

				BETTY

			(taking his arm)

		No. Let's get out of here.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. (LEADING TO LOVER'S LANE).

	They all ride in George's convertible up the twisting turning

	road. It has turned completely PINK with the dogwood petals.

	David winds up the trail, in the fading light, looking for

	refuge. He clutches the wheel tight.

				DAVID

		We should be okay up here.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE. THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.

	The car twists and turns up the narrow dirt road. After a

	moment, Lover's Lane reveals itself. It is lush and green

	like before only this time, there is one major difference. A

	phalanx of BLACK AND WHITE THUGS have created a roadblock in

	the foreground.

	WIDER.

	David jams on his breaks when he sees the barrier. It is a

	weird incongruous image: the black and white roadblock in

	front with the vibrant colors of the pond and willow behind--

	like some perfect dream you can never get to. The thugs have

	turned their cars sideways and dragged several huge logs

	across the road. They hold axe-handles in their hands.

				DAVID

			(a whisper)

		We better go.

	EXT. MAIN STREET. NIGHT.

	Darkness has fallen and the streetlamps have come on. Some

	debris is scattered around the street and distant sounds of

	the mob still fill the air. David rolls back into town with

	the headlights off.

	CLOSER. CAR.

				MARGARET

		Where are they?

				DAVID

		I'm not sure.

	They head down Main St. and turn the comer on Walnut. All at

	once, a weird ORANGE LIGHT bathes the car ...

	REVERSE ANGLE. THEIR POV.

	A BONFIRE has been lit in the middle of the street between the

	library and the barber shop. Twenty to thirty people are

	gathered around it still whooping and hollering as the bright

	ORANGE FLAMES shoot into the air.

	ANGLE. CAR.

	David pulls over by the curb, and their eyes go wide ...

	REVERSE ANGLE.

	From closer up, it becomes clear what they're burning. Huge

	piles of library books have been dumped onto the sidewalk,

	waiting their turn on the pyre. There is a strange celebratory

	atmosphere as they chuck book after book on the flames, with

	the glee of a teenager tossing a firecracker. David sees

	something and bolts from the car ...

				DAVID

		Oh my God.

	ANGLE. SIDE OF THE BONFIRE.

	Jennifer is locked in some strange wrestling match with Biff.

	He clutches a book over her head while she tugs at his wrist

	trying to stop him from throwing it on the fire ...

				JENNIFER

		Don't! Just let go.

				BIFF

		It's better, Mary Sue.

				JENNIFER

		I said, NO!

			(yanking it)

		... I've read like one book in my

		whole life and I'll be damned if I

		let you throw it on that fire ...

	Jennifer wrestles with him for a couple of seconds and then

	suddenly kicks Biff in the groin. He doubles over in agony

	when Jennifer snatches the book and bolts in the other

	direction.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE. STREET.

	She sprints up the street and is just passing the barber shop

	when a hand reaches out and grabs her. Jennifer starts to

	scream but David puts a hand to her mouth.

				DAVID

			(a whisper)

		It's okay. It's me.

								CUT TO:

	WIDE SHOT. SODA SHOP. OTHER SIDE OF MAIN STREET.

	The crowd has moved on and all that is left is the dark

	wreckage of the soda shop. Several stools lie out in the

	street and shards of brightly painted glass are scattered

	around the sidewalk. It is eerily quiet.

	WIDER.

	David, Betty and Margaret sit silently in the car, across the

	street with the lights off. He unlatches the door handle and

	gets out slowly. The rest of them follow him into the empty

	street as they move silently toward the soda shop, like some

	platoon on patrol.

	REVERSE ANGLE.

	As they get closer, more of the wreckage comes into view. Half

	a booth ... a soda spigot ... After a moment or two Jennifer

	looks up and gasps.

	CLOSER.

	Several teenagers step out of the shadows. They have scraped

	faces and ripped clothing--the signs. Most are dazed and ALL

	OF THEM ARE IN COLOR. After a second or two, more appear:

	Mary Jane ... Lisa Anne ... The boy who was reading Huck

	Finn...

	ANGLE. DAVID.

	The kids turn to him as if he has some kind of answer. Of

	course he doesn't. The sounds of the Mob still carry through

	the air from somewhere off in the distance.

				DAVID

		Let's go inside.

	INT. SODA SHOP.

	The place is just sad. All the remnants of what they had are

	strewn around the floor, The jukebox is turned over. The

	stools are ripped out of the floor. Betty looks over at the

	corner where he painted her ... The easel is smashed to bits.

	ANGLE. BETTY.

	She brings a knuckle to her lip and David puts an arm around

	her and draws her close. After a moment or two they HEAR a

	weird SCRAPING sound.

				DAVID

		Hello?

	The SCRAPING SOUND stops. They all look to the open door and

	after a second or two, Mr. Johnson appears holding a broom and

	dustpan.

				MR. JOHNSON

		Just thought I'd try to tidy it up

		a bit.

	Betty runs across and throws her arms around him. The

	teenagers watch as she holds him tight.

				MR. JOHNSON (CONT)

		It's okay. Once we sweep it up it'll

		be alright again ...

	Betty stifles a sob as he strokes her hair. No one says

	anything while they just embrace for a moment. Finally ...

				DAVID

		Well he's right. Come on. Let's turn

		these booths back up. "Mary Sue",

		why don't you help me slide this in

		front of the door. We'll be okay in

		here.

	They respond to the tone of leadership. One by one the kids

	start to pitch in, sifting their way through the wreckage.

	Jennifer and David slide a barricade in front of the door as

	the kids try to put their shop back together.

								CUT TO:

	INT. TOWN HALL. (CHAMBER OF COMMERCE MEETING) NIGHT.

	Big Bob stands at the podium addressing a packed house. The

	atmosphere is odd: somewhere between a bake-off and a

	lynching. People sit in the aisles and in the window sills.

	Bob points his finger.

				BOB

		This is not the answer people.

	The crowd quiets a bit. He leans over the lectern.

				BOB (CONT)

		No matter how upset we may get, or

		how frustrated we may be, we're

		not gonna solve our problems out

		in the street. It's just the wrong

		way to do it. We have to have a

		"Code of Conduct" we can all agree

		to live by.

	His tone grows softer--more concerned ...

				BOB (CONT)

		Now, I asked George and Burt here

		to sketch out some ideas-and I

		think they've done a terrific job.

			(beat/

			scans the crowd)

		If we all agree on these then we

		can take a vote and I think we'll

		start to move in the right direction.

	ANGLE. CROWD.

	They murmur and nod ...

				BOB

			(reading from the

			CODE OF CONDUCT")

		"ONE: All public disruption and

		acts of vandalism are to cease

		immediately."

	EXT. BONFIRE. NIGHT.

	It is still ablaze with books. As Bob continues to READ in

	VOICE OVER, a firetruck comes screeching up to the curb.

	SHOT. FIRETRUCK.

	The same fireman who learned to use the hose before pulls

	several yards of it from the back of the truck. He can barely

	contain his excitement as he gets to open the valve and

	extinguish the raging bonfire ...

				BOB

		"TWO: All citizens of Pleasantville

		are to treat one another in a

		courteous and "pleasant" manner ..."

	SERIES OF SHOTS. LAMPPOSTS.

	The CODE OF CONDUCT is nailed to lampposts and tree trunks in

	rapid succession. It is plastered on walls and in shop

	windows ...

	SODA SHOP.

	Debris is still strewn around the street. A dim light

	emanates from inside.

	INT. SODA SHOP.

	It looks like a scene from the French Revolution. Ten to

	fifteen kids huddle behind the barricade while David reads

	the code of conduct out loud by flashlight.

				LISA ANNE

		"Courteous and Pleasant manner."

		That doesn't sound too bad.

	David just looks at her then continues.

				DAVID

			(reading from THE CODE)

		"THREE: The area commonly known as

		Lover's Lane as well as the

		Pleasantville Public Library shall

		be closed until further notice."

	This sends a murmur amongst the kids.

				DAVID (CONT)

		"FOUR: The only permissible

		recorded music shall be the

		following: Pat Boone, Johnny

		Mathis, Perry Como, Jack Jones,

		The marches of John Phillips

		Souza or the Star Spangled

		Banner. In no event shall any

		music be tolerated that is not of

		a temperate or "pleasant" nature."

				VARIOUS KIDS

			(overlapping)

		"Oh my gosh ... No ..."

	David holds up his hand.

				DAVID

		"FIVE: There shall be no public

		sale of umbrellas or preparation

		for inclement weather of any kind."

	Various glances dart back and forth between them. David

	continues.

				DAVID (CONT)

		"SIX: No bedframe or mattress may

		be sold measuring more than 38

		inches wide."

			(pause)

		"SEVEN: The only permissible exterior

		paint colors shall be BLACK, WHITE or

		GRAY, despite the recent availability

		of certain alternatives."

	David looks over at Mr. Johnson who just winces slightly.

	Betty clutches his hand.

				DAVID (CONT)

		"EIGHT: All elementary and high

		school curriculums shall teach the

		"non-changist" view of history--

		emphasizing "continuity" over

		"alteration."

			(David pauses)

		Wow.

	David lowers the paper.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE.

	It is SILENT in the soda shop. Everyone sits motionless for a

	moment or two, letting the decree sink in. David just stares

	down at the piece of paper in his hand with a weird kind of

	sadness.

	Off in the corner, however, one of the boys has been fiddling

	with the jukebox and hasn't paid any attention to what was

	being read. All of a sudden, his voice rings from the corner.

				BOY

		Hey. This thing works.

	He hits a button and BUDDY HOLLY's voice fills the soda shop.

	RAVE ON blares at almost top volume recalling a more festive

	time.

				BUDDY HOLLY

		Well all the things that you say

		and do Make me want to be with

		you-oo-oo ...

				LISA ANNE

			(suddenly/

			in a panic)

		Turn that off!

	The boy looks back at her.

				LISA ANNE (CONT)

			(shrieking)

		You're not allowed to do that now!

	He flinches and pulls the plug from the wall. The jukebox

	winds down with a groan as the electricity drains out of it.

	David looks at the kids then suddenly speaks in a calm clear

	tone.

				DAVID

		Sure you are.

	He walks across the soda shop and plugs it back in. The kids

	watch spellbound at this personal display of defiance.

	WIDER SHOT. SODA SHOP.

	Buddy Holly's voice fills the Soda Shop but it has a suddenly

	different meaning. All the kids listen spellbound, as if to

	an anthem, while the Rock and Roll lives up to its rebellious

	reputation.

				BUDDY HOLLY

		The little things that you say and do

		Make we want to be with you-oo-oo ...

		RAVE ON! It's a crazy feeling ...

		RAVE ON! It's got me reelin' ...

	Jennifer looks over at her brother with pride. Betty puts an

	arm around Mr. Johnson, feeling a little stronger--a little

	safer ... The kids seem to relax a bit, and even if they

	don't feel totally reassured, at least they don't feel

	ashamed.

	Twenty "colored" faces listen as Buddy Holly tells them RAVE

	ON. David stands beside the jukebox like a captain at the

	helm of his ship ...

	EXT. STREET. LATER ...

	He steps out over the debris and looks both directions. David

	motions toward the shop and a moment later the kids emerge.

	The disturbance seems to have died down and the street is

	silent although strewn with debris. David turns to the kids.

				DAVID

			(whisper)

		Stick together till you get off

		Main Street.

	They nod and head off down the block. David just watches them

	silently from the wreckage of the soda shop ...

								DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. TOWN SQUARE. NIGHT.

	The Fire Department is cleaning up the charred remains of the

	bonfire ...

	INT. SODA SHOP. LATER ...

	Betty is asleep in one of the booths. Jennifer sleeps beside

	her on the floor. David and Margaret sleep next to them in

	another booth with Margaret curled up against his chest.

	David opens his eyes.

	REVERSE ANGLE. HIS POV.

	Mr. Johnson is standing in the middle of the shop, staring at

	the large piece of plywood where his window used to be. He

	just gazes at the thing as if he could look through it.

	There's a faraway look in his eye.

	SHOT. DAVID.

	He rises carefully from the booth, without waking Margaret.

	David crosses over to Mr. Johnson and speaks in a whisper.

				DAVID

		It's okay. We'll get you a new one.

				MR. JOHNSON

			(softly)

		I don't know what I'd do if I

		couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just

		don't know what I'd do ...

	CLOSE UP. DAVID.

	He just nods. David glances down at the table next to him. He

	picks up one of the brightly painted shards of glass and just

	looks at it. It's orange and pink and yellow. David thinks

	for a second.

				DAVID

		Maybe I have an idea.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. MAIN STREET. DAWN.

	The same paper boy who rode into the trash can, peddles down

	Main Street tossing his papers toward the curb. He throws

	right toward the post office, then left toward the hardware

	store, then right toward the bakery, then finally looks up.

	CLOSER.

	This time the boy slams into a lamp post. He tumbles off his

	bike and stares straight ahead in disbelief ...

	HIS POV. TOWN HALL.

	Two men sleep at the base of the wall next to a clutter of

	paint cans. Above them, however, is painted A VIVID ALMOST

	UTOPIAN MURAL OF THE TOWN OF PLEASANTVILLE in LIVING COLOR.

	Instead of being drab, the place literally gleams with life.

	The post office turns out to be a RICH RED BRICK. The sky

	shines in vibrant BLUE. It is a rendering of what the town

	could look like. David and Mr. Johnson sleep soundly next to

	their own signatures. David opens his eyes and sees the

	paperboy ...

	ANGLE. PAPER BOY.

	He turns around and rides away as fast as he can.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. TOWN HALL. LATER ...

	A huge crowd has gathered. There is a loud buzz in the air.

	David and Mr. Johnson stand side by side in front of their

	work like they're presenting and guarding it at the same

	time.

	REVERSE ANGLE. CROWD.

	Most of the faces are black and white. A few near the back

	are in color. Big Bob moves through the back of the crowd,

	hurriedly buttoning his shirt. The buzz grows and the people

	part as he heads toward the front of the pack ...

	ANGLE. FRONT OF CROWD.

	When Bob emerges from the crowd, Mr. Johnson flinches

	slightly. David just looks him in the eye and tries to find

	as much courage as he can. "Big" Bob looks up at the color

	rendering of his town with absolute horror. His eye scans the

	green trees, the bright yellow gas station, the puffy pink

	clouds on the horizon.

				BOB

			(bellowing)

		Did you do this?

				DAVID

			(quietly but clearly)

		Yes I did.

	Bob grabs a copy of the Code of Conduct and waves it at him.

				BOB

		Do you know that it's illegal?

				DAVID

			(thinks)

		Yes I do.

	Bob looks dumbfounded. He tries to process the whole thing

	but just looks more confused. Bob runs his hand through his

	hair, shaking his head.

				BOB

		BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?

				DAVID

		Because anybody should be able to

		paint in whatever color they want.

	ANGLE. BACK OF CROWD.

	Betty stands beside Margaret and Jennifer watching the

	spectacle. There are tears in her eyes and a great deal of

	love. Jennifer smiles with pride at her brother ...

	SHOT. BOB.

				BOB

		You're not allowed to do this! I

		could arrest you for this.

				DAVID

		Still doesn't make it right.

	There is some clapping from the back of the crowd. Bob's eyes

	widen. His face goes flushed (darker gray). A vein bulges in

	his neck. He turns to the police chief.

				BOB

		Dan! Arrest them!

				DAN (POLICE CHIEF)

			(quietly)

		Um ... I don't know how to do that,

		Bob.

				BOB

		What do you mean!?

				DAN

		Well, I never had to do it before.

				BOB

		You put handcuffs on them and you

		take them to the police station.

				DAN

			(thinks)

		Oh. guess I could do that, then.

				DAVID

			(suddenly stronger)

		C'mere, Dan. I'll help you.

	David walks toward the police chief and sticks his hands out.

	A louder murmur moves through the crowd as David actually

	helps him fasten on the cuffs. Mr. Johnson comes over to join

	them and the murmur starts to grow ...

								CUT TO:

	NIGHT TIME.

	A bright full moon stands out against a jet black sky ...

	EXT. MAIN STREET. NIGHT.

	A group of "colored" kids hangs out on Main Street near the

	police station. They gaze off into the distance at the barred

	window of a jail cell. It is elevated half a story above the

	street. Everything is black and white except for the warm

	YELLOW LIGHT, that glows through the bars. They know in a

	glance who's inside.

	INT. JAIL CELL. NIGHT.

	David sits on his bunk staring at the ceiling. The place has

	never been used so there is still plastic wrapping on all the

	sheets and pillow cases. He can't help smiling.

	INT. DIFFERENT JAIL CELL. WAY OFF DOWN THE HALL ...

	Mr. Johnson crouches on his bunk, ignoring his food. He

	clutches a rusty nail and scratches at the plaster wall in

	true "inmate" fashion.

	REVERSE ANGLE. WALL.

	Rather than scratching the days or even the hours, Mr.

	Johnson has carved a huge pastoral landscape into the wall

	complete with lush forest and a running brook. He looks at

	his work and smiles.

	SHOT. POLICE CHIEF.

	He approaches David's cell from the other direction and

	knocks gently on the bars. David turns around.

				DAN

		There's someone to see you Bud.

	DAVID.

	David sits upright on his bunk trying to think who it could

	be. After a moment or two, a strange look of understanding

	crosses his face. He HEARS the sound of a KEY TURNING IN THE

	LOCK. David looks up at the doorway and smiles.

				DAVID

		I thought it might be you.

	REVERSE ANGLE. DICK VAN DYKE.

	He stands in the doorway, still dressed in his TV repairman's

	outfit. FOR THE FIRST TIME, HE IS COMPLETELY IN BLACK AND

	WHITE.

				DICK VAN DYKE

		Hope you're proud of yourself.

				DAVID

		I am actually ... Glad to see you've

		finally shown your true colors.

	Dick Van Dyke gives a tight smile and shuts the door of the

	cell behind him.

				DICK VAN DYKE

		Okay, let's cut the shit and get

		right to it. Where's that remote

		control?

				DAVID

		Why?

				DICK VAN DYKE

		Because you're coming home.

				DAVID

			(smiles)

		Why don't you just take me back

		without it?

				DICK VAN DYKE

		Oh. You're a smart little bastard

		aren't you?

			(tightly)

		It's kind of like a restricted

		ticket. You gotta leave the same

		way you came.

	David just looks at him. He smiles, confidently. Leans back

	on the bunk ...

				DAVID

		So ... I guess as long as I'm

		here, all sorts of things could

		happen to this place. We could

		have pink lawns and blue trees ...

				DICK VAN DYKE

		Just gimme the damn remote!

				DAVID

		I'm sorry. I can't do that.

	Dick Van Dyke takes a deep breath. He glances toward the

	barred window.

				DICK VAN DYKE

		I don't know what went wrong.

		You answered every question. You

		knew every detail. The senior

		Prom ... McIntire's Department

		Store. We had all the same warm

		memories: Sock hops. The Church

		Social ...

				DAVID

		They weren't my memories.

			(beat)

		I borrowed them. It's no good when

		you borrow them.

	Dick Van Dyke's eyes go wide and he literally starts to

	tremble.

				DICK VAN DYKE

			(containing his rage)

		How long do you think you've been

		here?

				DAVID

			(warily)

		I don't know ... Three, four weeks.

				DICK VAN DYKE

		Much less than that.

			(checks his watch)

		An hour and a half.

	David looks at him uneasily. Dick Van Dyke flashes a broad

	nasty smile.

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)

		See--and this is really great--

		the show was on for what--half an

		hour a week? So that means for

		every week that goes by in

		Pleasantville, only half an hour

		goes by in the real world.

	The smile gets bigger. Dick Van Dyke moves closer to him.

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)

		Now Buddy, you're going on trial

		tomorrow. And if they find you

		guilty, you're gonna be stuck here

		forever. Well, not forever--lemme

		think ...

			(calculates)

		Five year sentence ... Carry the

		three ... That comes out to ...

		sixteen and a half centuries, and

		that's rounding down.

				DAVID

		I'm going on trial tomorrow?

				DICK VAN DYKE

		This is TV pal. They don't fool

		around.

	David is rocked but tries not to show it.

				DAVID

			(stoicly)

		There's worse places.

				DICK VAN DYKE

		Oh sure. For the first hundred

		years. Then it starts to get a

		little monotonous.

			(beat)

		Sleep well.

	He taps on the bars for Dan who opens the lock and lets him

	out. The door CLANGS shut as the two of them disappear down

	the hall. The minute they are gone, the stoicism falls. David

	looks around his cell, truly afraid.

	CLOSER.

	He stares at the tiny cot ... The plain light bulb in the

	ceiling ... The single pillow with the plastic covering it

	... Forever is starting to look like a long time. David

	crosses to the small window and looks out.

	HIS POV. OUT THE WINDOW.

	Across the town square he can see the side of the Town Hall

	complete with the newly painted mural. The "Utopian" view of

	Pleasantville is just as he left it with one notable

	exception: The edges of painting are starting to turn back to

	BLACK AND WHITE.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. TOWN HALL. DAY.

	It is bathed in sunlight. Dozens of people stream through the

	front door for the first trial in Pleasantville's history.

	There is a weird carnival atmosphere in the air.

	INT. TOWN HALL. DAY.

	The place has been transformed from the Chamber of Commerce

	meeting hall to a small town courtroom, complete with pews

	and ceiling fans. The only carry over from its previous

	configuration is the huge CHAMBER OF COMMERCE banner draped

	across the back wall.

	ANGLE. BENCH.

	At the center of the courtroom where the podium used to be is

	a large, elevated judge's bench with a Rotary insignia on the

	front. Big Bob sits six or seven feet above the proceedings

	finally living up to his name. The whole thing is a strange

	combination of Franz Kafka and "Inherit the Wind." Big Bob

	bangs the gavel ...

	CLOSER.

	The undertone begins to quiet down. All of the faces in the

	pews are Black and White. There is a "colored" section in the

	back for standing room only.

	ANGLE. JURORS BOX.

	George is seated in the front row of the jury, despite his

	relationship to one of the defendants. He is dressed

	impeccably with his Rotary Pin still gleaming on his lapel.

	After a moment or two he sneaks a glance toward the back of

	the room ...

	ANGLE. BETTY.

	She stands in the back with the rest of the "colored" faces.

	Betty cranes her head to catch a glimpse of David or Mr.

	Johnson. All at once, a hush goes through the crowd.

	ANGLE. DOORWAY.

	It swings open and David and Mr. Johnson are led in wearing

	handcuffs. Dan, the Police Chief (now ballif), shows them to

	a table in the center of the room directly facing Big Bob.

	There is no lawyer present. There is also no prosecutor.

	ANGLE. DAVID.

	He glances around a little confused. (Weird courtroom.) Big

	Bob bangs the gavel.

				BOB

		Bud Parker and William Johnson,

		you have been charged with

		desecration of a public building

		and the intentional use of

		prohibited paint colors in

		violation of the Pleasantville

		Code of Conduct and laws of

		common decency. Do you admit that

		on the night of May 1, you did

		consciously and willfully apply

		the following FORBIDDEN colors to

		the Pleasantville Town Hall:

			(beat)

		Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce,

		Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox

		Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson,

		Yellow, Olive and Magenta.

				DAVID

		Um ... Yes I do. Where's our

		lawyer?

				BOB

		We prefer to keep these

		proceedings as "pleasant" as

		possible. I don't think a lawyer

		will be necessary.

	There is a murmur and a great deal of nodding amongst the

	black and white faces. Big Bob smiles to himself then

	proceeds.

				BOB (CONT)

		Do you further admit that this

		was done surreptitiously and

		under the cover of darkness?

				DAVID

		Well--it was dark out ...

				BOB

		Good. Do you further admit that

		this unnatural depiction occurred

		in full public view where it was

		accessible to, and in plain sight

		of, minor children?

				DAVID

		It was accessible to everyone.

				BOB

		Very well. Let the record show

		that the defendants have answered

		in the affirmative to all the

		charges.

	He looks directly at them for the first time.

				BOB (CONT)

		Do you have anything to say in

		your defense?

	SHOT. DEFENSE TABLE.

	Mr. Johnson just looks at David, confused and terrified.

				MR. JOHNSON

		I didn`t mean to hurt anybody.

		I just have to paint ... I

		need to.

	He gropes for something else to say, but what else is there?

	David glances over and sees him sit slowly back in his seat.

	David rises from his chair.

				DAVID

		I think I've got something to say.

				BOB

		Very well ...

	David looks out over the audience. After a moment or two, he

	looks back at Big Bob.

				DAVID

		I think I know why you're doing

		this. I mean, I understand why

		you're doing this. I used to

		feel the same way. I used to

		want this place to stay just the

		way it was. I never wanted it to

		change ...

	There is a loud MURMUR. Big Bob bangs the gavel.

				DAVID (CONT)

			(he smiles slightly)

		But nothing stays the same. You

		get things, and you lose things,

		and that's the good part and the

		bad part--but you can't have a

		good part without a bad part.

	He turns and sees his mother in the balcony. They lock eyes

	for a moment. David smiles slightly and continues.

				DAVID (CONT)

		It's like the basketball team.

				BOB

			(leaning forward)

		The basketball team?

				DAVID

		Sure. Everybody's upset because

		they're not winning anymore--but

		just think how it would feel if

		all of a sudden they do win.

	There's a murmur in the gallery.

				DAVID (CONT)

		Wouldn't it feel better than when

		they used to win all the time?

	There is a LOUDER MURMUR. Big Bob looks concerned.

				DAVID (CONT)

		See, I know you want it to stay

		"Pleasant" but there are so many

		things that are so much better:

		like Silly ... or Sexy ... or

		Dangerous ... or Wild ... or

		Brief ...

			(beat)

		And every one of those things is

		in you all the time if you just

		have the guts to look for them.

			(pointing to the "colored" section)

		Look at those faces back there.

		They're no different than you are.

		They just happened to see

		something inside themselves that

		you don't want to ...

				BOB

		Okay--that's enough!

				DAVID

		I thought I was allowed to

		defend myself.

				BOB

		You're not allowed to lie.

				DAVID

		I'm not lying ... Here I'll show

		you.

	He turns suddenly toward the jury box.

				DAVID (CONT)

		Mr. Simpson ...

				MR. SIMPSON

		Yes.

				DAVID

		What color is that hedge of yours?

				MR. SIMPSON

		Green.

				DAVID

		No, not that hedge. The other one.

				MR. SIMPSON

		The other one?

				DAVID

		The one in your mind. The one

		that you see on a bright cold

		morning. The one that you see

		when you walk in front of your

		house and you just stand there

		and stare.

	Mr. Simpson suddenly looks far away. He gets a kind of dreamy

	look in his eye.

				DAVID (CONT)

		What color is that hedge?

	CLOSE UP. MR. SIMPSON.

	SUDDENLY AND BEFORE OUR EYES, MR. SIMPSON TURNS TO LIVING

	COLOR. A huge MURMUR moves through the courtroom. Bob bangs

	the gavel.

				BOB

		I said, that's enough!

				VARIOUS VOICES FROM

				THE AUDIENCE

		"No ... Let him finish ... Go on ..."

	Big Bob lifts the gavel and is about to bang it when David

	suddenly turns toward George.

				DAVID

		Alright. Dad ...

	DIFFERENT ANGLE.

	There is a LOUDER MURMUR. Big Bob just looks at him frozen

	while David confronts his "father." George straightens up.

				GEORGE

			(solemn)

		Yes Bud.

				DAVID

			(beat)

		Don't you miss her?

	CLOSE UP. GEORGE.

	He looks at him stunned. Big Bob bangs the gavel but nobody

	listens. George just stares at him like he got shot.

				DAVID

		I mean, of course you do, but it

		isn't just the cooking or the

		cleaning that you miss--it's

		something else, isn't it ...

	George swallows. The UNDERTONE in the room starts to grow as

	he glances toward the back of the room.

				DAVID (CONT)

			(softer whisper)

		Maybe you can't even describe it.

		Maybe you only know it when it's

		gone. Maybe it's like there's a

		whole piece of you that's missing

		too.

			(shrugs)

		You might even call it "love."

				BIG BOB

			(BANGING the gavel loudly)

		Okay, that's IT!!!

				DAVID

			(motioning toward the back)

		Now don't you think she looks just

		as pretty in color? Don't you

		think she looks just as pretty as

		she did the day you met her?

	Slowly, almost imperceptibly George nods. A single tear rolls

	down his cheek. As it traces the side of his face it leaves a

	long trail of COLOR behind it.

				DAVID (CONT)

		Don't you wish you could tell her

		that?

	He nods again and it all comes out. Betty smiles at him

	through her tears. Even Mr. Johnson smiles as well.

				BOB

			(POUNDING the gavel)

		YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!

				DAVID

		Why am I out of order?

				BOB

		BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO

		TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!

				DAVID

		Well I don't think it's a circus.

		And I don't think they do either.

	David motions behind him to the black and white section.

	There are now ten to fifteen "colored" faces.

				BOB

		THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.

				DAVID

		But see that's just the point. It

		can't stop at once. Because it's

		in you. And you can't stop

		something that's in you.

				BOB

			(tightly)

		It's not in ME.

				DAVID

		Oh sure it is.

				BOB

		No it isn't.

	He crosses to the bench looking right up at Big Bob. He leans

	over the bench and gets right up in his face.

				DAVID

			(smug whisper)

		What do you want to do to me

		right now?

	Big Bob starts to tremble. He shakes with rage as David moves

	closer.

				DAVID (CONT)

		C'mon. Everyone's turning colors.

		Kids are making out in the street.

		No one's getting their dinner--

		hell, you could have a flood any

		minute ... Pretty soon you could

		have the women going off to work

		while the men stayed home and

		cooked ...

				BIG BOB

		That's not going to happen!

				DAVID

		But it could happen.

				BIG BOB

		No it couldn't!

	Big Bob looks at David and starts to tremble. It starts

	around the base of his neck, spreads quickly up the rest of

	his head. After a moment or two, Big Bob has gone completely

	RED IN THE FACE.

	WIDER.

	A gasp goes through the courtroom. David looks at him and

	just smiles. The crowd reaction turns almost to a ROAR as Big

	Bob turns and catches his reflection in the window.

	CLOSE UP. BIG BOB.

	He sees the ruddy image staring back at him, then looks down

	at his hands. They have gone completely RED as well. Big Bob

	freezes for an instant then bolts from the bench in panic and

	flees the room--flinging open the doors to the courtroom.

	ANGLE. DOORWAY.

	As Big Bob flees, he reveals an amazing sight: the Town

	Square GLISTENS IN LIVING COLOR. The huge lawn is a rich deep

	green. The sky is a dense opaque blue. Dozens of spectators

	bolt from their seats and rush to the doorway as the crowd

	moves outside.

	EXT. PLEASANTVILLE. (FULL COLOR!)

	All the birds are really chirping. Red Brick, Yellow cars,

	Green hats ... The barber pole in front of Gus' has finally

	turned to red, white and blue--he can't help smiling. David

	walks out into the sunlight and stares in wonder at his

	creation. The whole town is washed in joy.

	WIDER.

	Margaret comes up and throws her arms around him. They meet

	in a rich passionate kiss (in direct defiance of the code of

	conduct). Several people around them actually clap, like

	spectators at a wedding. Jennifer moves up next to them and

	looks at her brother making out.

				JENNIFER

		Uch ... I am like gonna hurl ...

	David turns and looks at her. Both of them laugh. David

	throws his arms around his sister as more and more people

	stream out of the courtroom into the sunlight ...

								DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. MAIN STREET. DAY.

	David and Jennifer stand together on the edge of town. She

	clutches a valise in her hand. He holds the remote control.

				DAVID

		Are you sure?

				JENNIFER

		I told you. I'm like positive.

				DAVID

		This thing works. We could go

		home right now.

				JENNIFER

		I'm not ready yet. I gotta do

		this for a little while.

	WIDER.

	They stand on the edge of town (which finally has an edge).

	A large sign says: "Springfield 12 Miles" and for the first

	time, the end of Main Street is no longer the beginning.

	Jennifer is dressed in Mary Sue's clothes with a little bit

	of style thrown in. Rich fields of wheat spread out in the

	distance.

				JENNIFER

		Besides. You think there's like

		a chance I'm gonna get into

		college back there?

				DAVID

			(thinks ...)

		Honestly ... no.

	They both smile.

				DAVID (CONT)

		You got the admissions letter.

				JENNIFER

		Right here.

				DAVID

		And you're sure about this?

				JENNIFER

		I've done the slut thing, David.

		It's really kinda old.

	David nods.

				DAVID

		I'll come back and check on you

		in a month.

	Jennifer nods and gives him a hug. She holds on tight for a

	couple of seconds.

				JENNIFER

		You're like the coolest brother

		in the world.

	David smiles. Never been called cool before. They suddenly

	hear the SOUND of a motor and look to their left. A huge

	Greyhound bus lumbers up the highway, pulling to a halt at

	the sign. The doors open beckoning her in. Jennifer smiles at

	her brother, then turns toward the door ...

	EXT. MARGARETS HOUSE. DAY.

	She clutches her umbrella at her side. David holds a bag of

	oatmeal cookies. Each one clings on to the other one's

	clothing. Their faces are inches apart.

				MARGARET

		You're gonna forget about me.

				DAVID

		No I won't. I swear.

	Margaret nods. She looks at him for a moment then wraps her

	arms around his neck. They meet in a long, rich, wet, soft

	kiss. The umbrella falls to the ground ...

				MARGARET

			(a whisper)

		I like calling you David.

				DAVID

		I like it too.

	INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM.

	David stands in front of the television with Mr. Johnson at

	his side. He holds the remote control in his hand. Mr.

	Johnson seems pretty amazed at the whole idea.

				MR. JOHNSON

		Well how do you know it won't go

		back to the way it was?

				DAVID

		You're gonna keep painting aren't

		you?

	Mr. Johnson nods.

				DAVID (CONT)

		Well ...

	He nods again and thinks about it. They smile at each other

	one last time.

				MR. JOHNSON

			(remembering something)

		Oh.

			(reaching into his pocket)

		I've got something for you.

	He pulls out a folded piece of paper. Mr. Johnson extends it

	to David who unfolds it and instantly smiles.

	INSERT. PAPER.

	It is a small painted replica of their mural in the same

	vibrant colors. Everything is scaled perfectly, exactly like

	the one on the wall.

	SHOT. DAVID.

				DAVID

		It's beautiful.

				MR. JOHNSON

		Just a little--You know.

	David looks up at him and smiles. All at once he glances

	toward the door.

	WIDER.

	Betty is standing there holding a brown paper bag. A sweater

	is draped over her arm.

				BETTY

			(extending the bag)

		I made you these for the trip.

		They're marshmallow rice squares.

				DAVID

		Thanks. I thought you weren't

		gonna ...

				BETTY

			(painful/

			quieter)

		I had to say goodbye.

	She looks up at David and their eyes lock. Betty hands him

	the bag.

				BETTY (CONT)

		There's a meatloaf sandwich in

		there too. Don't go skipping

		dinner just 'cause you're not

		here anymore.

				DAVID

		I won't.

				BETTY

			(voice quivering)

		And ... wear this on the trip in

		case it gets cold.

				DAVID

			(nodding)

		... It's a pretty short trip.

	She nods as well. Betty puts the sweater around his shoulders

	anyway and fusses with the collar for a second or two. Then

	she throws her arms around his neck.

				BETTY

		I'm so proud of you, Bud.

				DAVID

		Thanks ... I love you.

				BETTY

		I love you too.

	She clings on tight for a second or two then lets go. Betty

	flicks away a tear and draws a deep breath.

				BETTY (CONT)

		Well ...

	She steps back and looks at him. David glances down at the

	remote.

				DAVID

		You better stand back a little.

	Betty and Mr. Johnson cross toward the comer of the room.

	David points the remote at the TV ...

								CUT TO:

	EXT. MODERN HOUSING TRACT. DAY.

	All the ersatz Spanish houses stretch out toward infinity. A

	WESTEC security patrol cruises by them at a crawl. A second

	or two later, all the sprinklers turn on in uniform

	synchronization.

	INT. DAVID'S LIVING ROOM.

	He stands in the middle of the living room looking at his

	new/old surroundings. Everything is the same as it was. The

	black onyx coffee table. The clean burbur rug. The big screen

	TV in its sleek black cabinet. David looks at it and smiles.

	The place is inadvertantly in black and white.

	CLOSER.

	He reaches forward and turns on the TV (by hand) flipping

	around the dial. Jerry Springer is berating a prostitute ...

	Tony Robbins hawks self-improvement in an infomercial ...

	Court TV is doing an O.J. recap. David unfolds Mr. Johnson's

	sketch and glances down at it. He smiles to himself. A

	different kind of nostalgia ...

						END
