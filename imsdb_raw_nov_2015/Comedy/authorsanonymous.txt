1   EXT. FITZGERALD/GRAHAM APARTMENT -- HOLLYWOOD - DAY              

    North Hayworth Avenue, off Sunset Boulevard. A quiet, tree-

    lined residential street. Note the small apartment complex

    set back from the curb.

    CAPTION: HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA

    Our narrator is HENRY OBERT (O-BURT)(30).

                           HENRY (V.O.)

               This is where where F. Scott

               Fitzgerald died on December 21, 1940.

    INSERT ARCHIVAL PHOTOS of Fitzgerald.   His work.   His life.

                           HENRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)

               Fitzgerald was one of the truly great

               American writers of the 20th century.

               Tender is the Night. The Last Tycoon.

               This Side of Paradise. And, of course,

               my favorite, The Great Gatsby. But

               Fitzgerald ended up out here. Writing

               movies that never got made. Drinking

               too much. Alienating people. Losing

               his way.

2   EXT.   FITZGERALD/GRAHAM APARTMENT -- SIDEWALK - DAY             

    Henry stands on the sidewalk. Full of promise and hope.

    Wears a pizza delivery outfit as he stares at the apartment,

    more with reverence than curiosity.

    CAPTION: HENRY OBERT

                           HENRY (V.O.)

               I stop by here sometimes--out of

               respect. Fitzgerald had this amazing

               gift.

3   EXT. FITZGERALD/GRAHAM APARTMENT -- SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS        

    Henry crosses the street--heading for his parked Honda.     He

    unlocks the car. Swings open the back door.

                           HENRY (V.O.)

               But he wasted it. He wasted his

               talent.

    Henry yanks a MAGNETIC SIGN out of the back seat and slaps

    it on the outside of the driver's door: PIZZA STARZ. One

    last glance at the fabled apartment complex.

                                                                 2.

                          HENRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)

              When I sell my novel, I won't make

              his mistakes.

4   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM - DAY                

    The man (40's) and woman (30's) sit on the couch in their

    tastefully-decorated San Fernando Valley home. Expensive

    taste in clothes. Her cleavage a bit too obvious. Both

    seem a little uncomfortable. Uncertain.

    CAPTION: DR. ALAN & COLETTE MOONEY

    They look off to the side, speaking to someone off-camera.

                          ALAN

              We thought this was going to be a

              reality series.

                          COLETTE

              You know, like the Kardashians.

    They listen.    Here comes the bad news.

                          ALAN

              Oh. Really? A documentary? This

              is going to be a documentary about

              our writing group?

                          COLETTE

              The whole group. Not just us, right?

              Not that it should be just about

              us...

    Nervous laugh.

                            ALAN

              No.

    They look at each other: A documentary? They try to mask

    their disappointment.

                          COLETTE

              So this is going to be like--like

              what I saw the other night on cable?

              About bees mating.

                          ALAN

              Or that, um, that one about the

              Holocaust.

    Colette nods, remembering.

                          ALAN (CONT'D)

              Pretty...Pretty--

                                                               3.

                             COLETTE

              --Powerful.

                           ALAN

              Powerful.   Yes. Powerful.

                          COLETTE

              We love documentaries.

                             ALAN

              We do.

    They look at each other again: What have we gotten into?

                          COLETTE (V.O.)

              Natasha, the Russian peasant, dressed

              oh-so-slowly...

5   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- DINING ROOM - EVENING           

    A POSTER BOARD SIGN--someone went to Kinko's--is posted

    prominently reading: QUIET, PLEASE--WRITERS AT WORK.

                          COLETTE (V.O.)

                  (Reading)

              ...consumed totally, completely,

              absolutely, by endless thoughts of

              Yuri fondling her breast, his other

              hand groping her womanhood, knowing...

    They sit around the dining room table. Colette, convinced

    she's the next Amy Tan, reads aloud from her TYPED PAGES.

    The others all have copies in front of them. We recognize

    Henry, the frog waiting to become a prince, making copious

    notes and Alan, oh-so-proud, hanging on every word. Beaming.

    Three others round out the group:

    Younger MAN (early 30s). Unshaven. Always thinks he's the

    coolest guy in any room. Can't avoid glances at the camera.

    CAPTION: WILLIAM BRUCE

    The OLDEST MEMBER of the group (over 60) sits with his arms

    folded as he listens, shifting in his chair. Captain Grumpy.

    CAPTION: JOHN K. BUTZIN

    Finally, the young (mid-to-late 20s), angelic, WOMAN listening

    intently, the one who probably stopped to rescue a cat on

    her way here.

    CAPTION: HANNAH RINALDI

                                                                  4.

                          COLETTE (CONT'D)

              ...Any second that she might explode,

              her chastity spraying across the

              ceiling...Spraying across the ceiling

              like passionate graffiti. Natasha

              never thought such a moment possible.

              "Have I satisfied you, Natasha?"

              Yuri had inquired after their fourth

              round of vodka-soaked lovemaking.

              "Nyet, Not yet," Natasha stated,

              exhausted, but grateful.

    Awkward silence around the table as Colette removes her

    reading glasses and waits. Alan clears his throat, looking

    cheerful.

                           ALAN

              Well?   Comments?

6   INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                       6

    Henry's sparse studio apartment. Minimal furniture. His laptop

    is set up on an old door, stretched across some blue plastic

    crates.

    There are BOOKS piled everywhere. All sorts of books. And

    PAPER -- pieces of paper, including letters and cards and

    printed emails, dozens of them, are taped throughout the

    small apartment.

    We are introduced to Henry the writer: pondering over his

    battered laptop, pacing up and down the floor, checking his

    nearly empty refrigerator, stretched out on his Goodwill

    couch, watching TV.

    Finally, inspiration. Henry rushes to his desk and taps out

    a sentence or two on his computer, feeling proud for his

    accomplishment.

                          HENRY (V.O.)

              I graduated from the University of

              Illinois. English major. Taught

              high school for a couple years, but

              hated it. Moved out here to be a

              writer.

7   EXT. HOUSE - DAY/NIGHT                                             7

    As Henry's voice over continues, we see him in uniform with

    pizza in hand at the front door of a house. Rings doorbell.

                          HENRY (V.O.)

              I work two jobs. Delivering pizzas

              and cleaning carpets. Good jobs for

              a writer.

                                                                   5.

8    INT. HOUSE - DAY/NIGHT                                             8

     Henry cleaning the carpets as the heavily-tattooed MOTORCYCLE

     DUDE points to a dirty spot: Over here.

                           HENRY (V.O.)

               You meet lots of interesting people.

9    INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                       9

     Henry points to the letters on the wall. C.U. picks up on

     phrases like "We regret to inform you," or "Sorry, but this

     story isn't right for us," or "The Baxter Agency currently

     isn't accepting new clients."

                           HENRY (V.O.)

               I have two unpublished novels.

               Working on my third, Pizza to Go.

               These are my rejection letters.

               Rejected by agents. Rejected by

               publishers. When you think about

               it, it's pretty amazing how many

               ways people can reject you.

10   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- DINING ROOM - NIGHT               10

     Henry, John, Alan, Colette, Hannah, and William sit around

     the table. Impressive buffet of cold cuts, cheeses, and

     shrimp has been set out.

                           HENRY (V.O.)

               Our writing group meets every Tuesday

               night. Mostly at Alan and Colette's.

               Sometimes we rotate.

     John helps himself to some shrimp.   Then helps himself to

     some more.

                           HENRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)

               I love coming to the group. Everyone

               always has such constructive feedback.

               It's like we're all in this together.

                           HANNAH

               I really like the way Yuri is

               developing, Colette.

                              COLETTE

               You do?

                           JOHN

               Well, if you ask John K. Butzin...

     Can't help looking at the camera. Making sure it's on him.

                                                              6.

                      JOHN (CONT'D)

          You're still going to have to explain

          why this Natasha dame goes AWOL on

          her husband. Still kinda iffy to

          me.

Another glance at the camera: Did you get that?

                      ALAN

          I was bothered by that, too. Why

          would Natasha betray a reliable,

          dependable husband for a washed-up

          young punk?

All eyes on Colette.    She shifts in her chair.   Uncomfortable.

                       COLETTE

          Oh.   Well...um...um...

An uneasy silence. Colette is blocked--nowhere to go

creatively. Her face tightens up. Bites her lip.

                      COLETTE (CONT'D)

          Oh God. I've been rewriting and

          rewriting and rewriting and--

                         ALAN

          Poodles.     It's OK.

                      COLETTE

          No. It's not OK. I still can't

          explain Natasha's motive. What's

          the use? I'm not a writer.

William to the rescue.

                      WILLIAM

          Whoa. Whoa. Time out. The dude's

          good in bed. Trust me, that's all

          the motive she needs.

                      JOHN

          Roger that. Torpedo Chapter Three.

          Blow it up. Get the focus back on

          this broad--Natasha.

                      HENRY

          --Yes. I was thinking the same thing.

                       HANNAH

          Make it clear that Natasha wants to

          be closer...

Colette makes notes furiously, nodding in agreement.

                                                                   7.

                            HENRY (V.O.)

                Writing can be such a solitary

                existence, so it's good to have this

                outlet where you can meet other

                writers and exchange ideas. Here it

                really is all for one and one for

                all.

11   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- DINING ROOM - NIGHT               11

     Later that evening.    Meeting is over.

     Alan, Colette, Hannah, Henry, William, and John are all

     standing up now. William stretches. John reaches for more

     shrimp. Friendly banter. Laughter.

                            COLETTE

                Who wants coffee?

     Everybody does.    William taps Henry on the shoulder.

                             WILLIAM

                Lend me ten bucks? I'm having cash

                flow issues.

                             HENRY

                Sure.

                            WILLIAM

                Thanks, bro'. You're the best.

12   INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                       12

     Henry sits at his desk, staring at the blank computer. Lost

     in thought. Emphasis on lost.

                            HENRY (V.O.)

                This new novel Pizza to Go is about

                Scott, a pizza delivery guy in LA.

                He comes across some interesting

                characters. I like what I have so

                far, but it's only a hundred pages

                and I'm stuck...

13   INT.   HENRY'S APARTMENT - LATER - DAY                             13

     Henry stands in front of the mirror in his apartment, wearing

     the Pizza Starz hat and shirt. Ready for work.

                            HENRY (V.O.)

                ...Haven't written a word in the

                last two weeks. Not one. Hannah

                teases me about having writer's block.

                                                                   8.

14   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- DINING ROOM - NIGHT               14

     FLASHBACK to the last group meeting. Focus on Hannah. Her

     smile. Her warmth. She listens and comments. Actively

     engaged in the conversation.

                           HENRY (V.O.)

               ...I keep thinking about her. She's

               all I think about. Really would

               like to ask her out.

15   INT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT - DAY                                      15

     Hannah reaches for a pair of READING GLASSES and slips them

     on. Talks to someone O.S.

                           HANNAH

               What do you think? On or off? Do

               they make me look smarter? I need a

               new pair.

     She takes the glasses off. Puts them back on. Off again.

     Debating. Hannah prepares herself with a series of quick

     breaths and waves her hands in the air. Then she stares

     directly into the camera.

                           HANNAH (CONT'D)

               Hi. I'm originally from Prescott,

               Arizona. Followed my mom out here

               about four years ago. That's her

               back there.

     Camera picks up a wisp of a WOMAN (over 50)in the background,

     waving, with an equally pleasant smile.

               fault.

16   INT. RESTAURANT #1 - DAY                                           16

     William favors jeans and faded tweed jacket. Sits in the

     corner of a Valley restaurant, nursing a cup of coffee and

     talks to the camera.

                           WILLIAM

               What do you want to know about me?

               I'm 27. Single. A virgin.

     He flashes that wicked, seductive smile.

                                                                  9.

                           WILLIAM (CONT'D)

               Just kidding. I'm actually 28.

               Hometown is Modesto, California, A

               sprawling junk heap of a town without

               a soul. Why did I come to LA? Um,

               because I knew you were here and

               that you'd loan me a hundred bucks

               if I needed it. Right?

     WAITRESS #1 refills his coffee cup. Her reward is that smile.

                           WILLIAM (CONT'D)

               Thanks, babe.

     She walks away.   William admires the view.

                           WILLIAM (CONT'D)

               I already got her number. Maybe I'll

               text her. Maybe I won't.

     Eyes back towards the camera.

                           WILLIAM (CONT'D)

               So 'bout that hundred bucks? What

               d'ya think?

     A hint of desperation in his voice.

                           WILLIAM (CONT'D)

               OK. What about fifty? C'mon, bro'.

               Support the arts.

17   INT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT -- DAY                                    17

     Hannah continues talking to the camera.   Maureen still in

     background.

                           HANNAH

               I've always had this knack for telling

               stories. Ever since I was a kid.

                           MAUREEN

               She's a natural.

                           HANNAH

               Moved here. Took a couple writing

               classes. Decided to go for it.

               24/7. Total dedication to my craft.

               The writing always comes first. My

               latest effort is called Sleeping on

               the Moon. It's about rejection. And

               pain. Not really about the moon

               itself. More of a...

                                                                  10.

     She searches for the word that escapes her. Maureen to the

     rescue.

                           MAUREEN

               Metaphor.

                           HANNAH

               Right.

18   INT. RESTAURANT #1 - DAY                                           18

     William continues talking to the camera.

                           WILLIAM

               So. LA? I'm here because of Bukowski.

               Charles Bukowski. Greatest writer

               ever. Period.

     INSERT ARCHIVAL PHOTOS of Charles Bukowski.

                           WILLIAM (CONT'D)

               LA is his town, man. If I'm gonna

               be a writer, then I have to walk in

               Bukowski's shoes. Experience and

               capture the plight of the working

               class.

     He waves to WAITRESS #1.

                           WILLIAM (CONT'D)

               I like the people in the group. But

               they can't write worth shit. But,

               man, Hannah is something. She's the

               only reason I keep going. Not because

               I'm learning anything. Hell, no. I

               just think she's hot.

19   INT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT -- DAY                                     19

     Hannah leans forward towards the camera, as if to hear better.

                           HANNAH

               My favorite writer? Favorite writer.

               Favorite writer...

     Hannah goes blank. The smile disappears as her face goes

     into noticeable contortions. This is worse than Final

     Jeopardy. She turns quiet, squirming.

                           HANNAH (CONT'D)

               Favorite. Wow. Hard to say. I've

               studied Composition more than actual

               Literature. Gee. I know Maureen

               enjoys Jane...

                                                               11.

     Searching for a last name, Hannah looks back to Maureen for

     help.

                              MAUREEN

               Jane Austen.

                           HANNAH

               That's the one. I hear she's good.

               But my favorite writer? Let me think

               about that a bit, OK?

     Short beat. Hannah lowers her voice, almost a loud

     confessional whisper.

                           HANNAH (CONT'D)

               I didn't go to college.

20   INT. JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY                                   20

     John is holding court at his mobile home, showcasing the

     finest in furniture from Sears. John stuffs his home with

     various MILITARY ARTIFACTS--photos, equipment, books. He's

     got it all. John talks to the camera.

                           JOHN

               Everything John K. Butzin knows

               about writing comes down to two simple

               words: Tom Clancy. Yes, sir. Tom

               Clancy. The man's a genius. Does

               his research. All those nitty-gritty

               technical details. Now that's writing!

               John K. Butzin has one agent very

               interested in Roaring Lion. And a

               publisher up in Oxnard is looking at

               it as we speak. Plus a certain

               cousin's best friend has a neighbor

               who has an in with Clint Eastwood,

               so Hollywood might be calling soon.

               Don't know how the other members of

               the writing group will handle all

               this success by one person. They

               better not be pussies.

21   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM - DAY              21

     Alan and Colette remain on the couch. Talking to the camera.

     All smiles. Much more comfortable with the camera.

                           ALAN

               Well, I'm an optometrist in Glendale.

                           COLETTE

               And I write full-time.

                                                                 12.

                           ALAN

               Our last name's Mooney. You could

               call us Mooneys. We get that joke

               all the time.

     The couple giggle at the joke. Forced.

                           ALAN (CONT'D)

               Which writer do I admire? Hmmm. How

               about John Grisham? Look at all

               that money he's made! Just teasing,

               John. We know you deserved every

               dime, but, hey, John, could you spread

               it around a bit, pal?

                           COLETTE

               Alan likes to tease.

     She gives her husband an affectionate squeeze.

                           ALAN

               Colette, here, is the real writer.

               I'm more of an idea guy. I come up

               with great ideas, but don't always

               follow through. I'll show you.

     He picks up his mini-digital Olympus RECORDER off the coffee

     table. Thinks for a second.

                           ALAN (CONT'D)

                   (To recorder)

               Idea for romantic novel.

     Alan catches himself.

                           ALAN (CONT'D)

               No. Make that, idea for romantic

               ebook.

     He winks at the camera--showing he's hip to the jargon.

                           ALAN (CONT'D)

               Possible movie option, too: Frovers.

               They couldn't be friends. They

               couldn't be lovers. So they became

               Frovers.

     Satisfied, Alan turns off the recorder.

22   EXT. COLETTE'S GARDEN - DAY                                       22

     Colette opens the sliding glass door and steps out into a

     beautiful garden area. Quiet and private. Camera follows

     her over to a solitary BENCH.

                                                                 13.

                            COLETTE

                This is where I come for inspiration.

                I believe a writer must have quiet

                and solitude. I'll meditate. Write

                in my journal. Set out my creative

                path for the day. This is my Walden

                Pond.

     Colette sits down on the bench. Takes in the environment.

                            COLETTE (CONT'D)

                Favorite author? I'd have to say

                Joan Didion. Her writing sends

                shivers down my spine. Though Joyce

                Carol Oates has been known to bring

                me to actual orgasm.

23   EXT. COLETTE'S GARDEN - DAY                                       23

     Colette sits on her bench, reading a BOOK. C.U. reveals

     that it is a novel by Joyce Carol Oates. Colette appears to

     be getting into the story just a bit too much.

24   EXT.   COLETTE'S GARDEN - DAY                                     24

     POOL GUY and GARDENER hear Colette's sensual cries drifting

     over the hedge. What the hell? They exchange puzzled looks.

25   EXT. COLETTE'S GARDEN - DAY                                       25

     Back to the present. Camera picks up a FRAMED PHOTO OF OPRAH

     from a corner of the bench. Holds it up for camera.

                            COLETTE

                Oh, this? I keep Oprah out here for

                luck. She's done so much to help

                writers. I know I'm going to be on

                her television show one day. I just

                know it.

     Colette can already see the moment in her mind. Short beat.

     Then she looks off-camera--listening to someone.

                           COLETTE (CONT'D)

                What? Oprah doesn't have a TV show

                anymore? Really? Since when?

     Short beat as she hears the answer.

                            COLETTE (CONT'D)

                Oh...

     Short beat as she tries to cover.

                                                                    14.

                           COLETTE (CONT'D)

               I knew that. I did. I-I knew.

26   INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                       26

     Henry stands in front of his mirror. Checks his appearance.

     Again. Talks to the camera.

                           HENRY

               Tonight's the night. I'm going to

               ask Hannah out.

     Henry becomes lost in thought.   Regroups.

                           HENRY (CONT'D)

               It's time. I like her. She likes me--

               I think. I've got to take action.

               Still stuck on Page 100. So I'm

               asking Hannah out on a date tonight.

               It'll be great. And I'll put this

               writer's block behind me.

     Checks his appearance one last time in the mirror.

                           HENRY (CONT'D)

               Wish me luck.

27   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                 27

     Alan sits in his favorite chair, talking directly to the

     camera.

                           ALAN

               I'm the group leader. After all,

               getting together was my idea. They're

               all my patients. That's how we met.

               First one published gets a free eye

               exam.

     Alan cackles a bit too hard at that joke.    He listens to a

     question being asked.

                           ALAN (CONT'D)

               Why did I form the group? To help

               Colette. Oh, I certainly enjoy the

               creative process, but Colette?

               Writing is her dream. I'd do anything

               for her because...because she's my

               dream. So there you have it.

     Alan reaches for his tape recorder.

                           ALAN (CONT'D)

               Possible names for future characters.

                           (MORE)

                                                                 15.

                           ALAN (CONT'D)

               Anthony Gilmore. No, wait. Make

               that Anthony T. Gilmore. Much

               better. Slate McCoy. Fletcher Peck.

               Fiona Foxx. And...a man known simply

               as Banjo.

     Satisfied, Alan turns off the recorder.

28   INT. RESTAURANT #1 - NIGHT                                        28

     Place is empty. Alan, Colette, William, John, and Henry

     gather around the center table.

     The WRITERS AT WORK poster is propped up against a nearby

     empty chair. Hard not to notice the EMPTY CHAIR at the table.

     Hannah is missing.

     Waitress #1 pours coffee all around. Henry fidgets in his

     chair, focused on the empty chair.

                           JOHN

                   (To William)

               How come we never chow down at your

               place?

                           WILLIAM

               This is my place. Close to the working

               people.

     John rolls his eyes.

                           HENRY

               Where's Hannah? Anyone know?

     Nobody responds. Alan checks his watch.

                           ALAN

               Time to get started.

                           HENRY

               Shouldn't we wait for Hannah?

                           WILLIAM

               Let's go, people. I'm ready to read.

                           ALAN

               William's right. We'll start. She'll

               show up.

     William starts passing out pages. Henry eyes the empty chair.

     Colette looks over William's pages. There are only three.

     She has a puzzled look.

                                                               16.

                           COLETTE

               William, aren't these the same pages

               you read last time?

                           WILLIAM

               Nope, they're different.

                           JOHN

               They look the same.

                           WILLIAM

               They're different. I changed a word.

                             HENRY

               One word?

                             COLETTE

               That's it?

                           WILLIAM

               Writing is rewriting, Colette.

               Bukowski said, "Write five words.

               Rewrite seven."

                           HENRY

               No. Dorothy Parker said that.

                             JOHN

               One word?    Jesus H. Christ.

                           WILLIAM

               It's my creative vision, John.

                           ALAN

                   (Jumping in)

               Which we are here to support. This

               is William's decision.

                           WILLIAM

               Let me just read. See if you can

               pick out the word. Tell me if it's

               better, or worse.

                           JOHN

                   (Muttering)

               One goddamn word.

     Henry continues staring at the empty chair.

29   INT. RESTAURANT #1 - NIGHT                                      29

     The evening meeting is winding to an end. John stands up to

     stretch. Alan slides papers into his leather satchel.

     HANNAH'S CHAIR remains empty. Henry remains concerned.

                                                             17.

                      HENRY

          I wonder what happened to Hannah.

                      ALAN

          It's not like her to miss.

The mystery is quickly solved. Front door opens. In rushes

Hannah, dashing directly towards the others, looking harried.

                       HANNAH

          I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for missing

          the meeting.

                      JOHN

          What happened? Your car break down?

                      ALAN

          You oversleep?

                      COLETTE

          Maureen. Is Maureen OK?

                     WILLIAM

          People. C'mon. Look at her. That

          glow. Hannah met a guy. She got

          laid.

Hannah gives William a playful smack on the back.

                      HANNAH

          As a matter of fact, I did meet a

          guy.

                      WILLIAM

          Told ya.

                      HANNAH

          His name's Brian.

Check out Henry. He looks absolutely horrified. No!

Hannah takes a deep breath and flashes a smile the size of

the Grand Canyon.

                      HANNAH (CONT'D)

          He's my new agent!

She remembers the camera.

                      HANNAH (CONT'D)

              (Directly to camera)

          An agent. I've got an agent!

Surprise and silence. The writers look at each other and

then back at Hannah. Not quite sure how to react.

                                                                 18.

     Stunned as Hannah turns her attention back to the group.

                            HANNAH (CONT'D)

                That writing class I took? Well,

                for the final project, I turned in

                the first chapter of Sleeping on the

                Moon. I guess the teacher liked it.

                Then he gave it to his friend who's

                an agent. Brian. He called. Had to

                see me right away. Brian wants to

                sign me.

                            WILLIAM

                Bet Brian wants more than that.

     Playful smack from Colette to William on the shoulder: Behave.

                            COLETTE

                That's so great, Hannah.

                            JOHN

                I salute you, young lady.

     And he does.

                             ALAN

                Yes.   Fantastic. Fanntasstic.

     Henry takes it all in quietly, unable to speak.

     Alan bounces up and gives Hannah a big hug as the others

     immediately start peppering her with questions.

30   INT.   RESTAURANT #1 - NIGHT                                      30

     Colette, Alan, John, William and Henry encircle a beaming

     Hannah as Waitress #1 snaps their PHOTO.

31   INT. RESTAURANT #1 - NIGHT                                        31

     Alan pops the drugstore CHAMPAGNE and pours into the cheap

     plastic cups, as Colette passes them around to Hannah, Henry,

     John, and William.

                            ALAN

                    (Raising cup)

                To Hannah!

     Everyone clinks their cups together.

                            HANNAH

                Thank you. But I just want to remind

                everyone that we're all in this

                together. I couldn't have come this

                far without the group.

                                                                19.

                           ALAN

                   (Smiling)

               All for one . . . .

     But our camera picks up on the individual writers and

     something is amiss. Everything seems a beat off. People

     appear happy, but a little subdued. The joy seems a bit too

     forced.

                           HANNAH

               I'm merely the first one to get

               signed. But we're all going to have

               an agent soon.

                           JOHN

               Well, as a matter of fact, there's

               an agent in Santa Monica very

               interested in John K. Butzin. He's

               reading the manuscript as we speak.

     The others let John's remark pass without comment.   William

     taps Henry on the shoulder.

                           WILLIAM

                   (Lower voice)

               Hey, can you lend me ten bucks?

     Henry is still a bit dazed by this unexpected turn of events.

                            HENRY

               Sure.

                           WILLIAM

               Thanks, bro'. You're the best.

     Henry's eyes can't leave Hannah.

32   EXT. RESTAURANT #1 - NIGHT                                       32

     The front door to the restaurant swings open and the writing

     group members tumble out into the evening. Alan carries his

     WRITERS AT WORK sign.

     William makes a move towards Hannah, but the the ever-

     protective Henry grabs her gently by her elbow, cutting

     William off. They start walking in one direction. William

     and John head out in the other. Meanwhile, Alan and Colette

     wave enthusiastically to Hannah.

                           ALAN

               Congratulations again, Hannah!

                            COLETTE

               Yes, yes.   Way to go, Hannah!

                                                                 20.

                           HANNAH

                   (Calling back)

               Thank you! 'Night.

     Alan and Colette continue to smile and wave until Hannah is

     out of ear shot.

                           ALAN

               Well, Hannah's got an agent.

     Short beat.

                           COLETTE

               She must have slept with him.

                           ALAN

               Of course she did.

33   EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT                                          33

     Henry and Hannah arrive at her car. She unlocks the front

     door of her clunker-of-a-Ford as Henry waits.

                           HENRY

               I'm so proud of you, Hannah.

                           HANNAH

               Your turn will come, Henry. You're a

               better writer than I am. So much

               better. You went to college.

     Hannah looks directly into the camera, pointing to Henry.

                           HANNAH (CONT'D)

               He's a great writer. Henry Obert. I

               knew him when.

     Henry, clearly embarrassed, puts his hand up to block the

     camera. Tries to change the subject.

                           HENRY

               Listen. Maybe some afternoon we

               could go for a drive. There are

               some special places I'd like to show

               you.

                           HANNAH

               Sure. I can't believe I've lived out

               here four years and haven't seen --

     She stops in mid-sentence.   A light goes on in her head.

                           HANNAH (CONT'D)

               Oh, my.

                                                                  21.

                           HENRY

               What?

                           HANNAH

               Four years. It's been four years

               since I moved here. And now I have

               an agent. It's the number four again.

               My lucky number. I should have known

               this was going to happen.

                           HENRY

               There is no one more deserving.

     Hannah rewards Henry's praise with a peck on the lips.    And

     a warm hug.

     Hannah steps in her car, starts it up and rolls down the

     window.

                           HANNAH

               I'm going to dedicate my novel to

               you.

     A final wave and Henry watches as she disappears into the

     night. He sighs.

34   INT. MONTAGE OF SHOTS - DAY                                        34

     A series of shots featuring the writers writing--or, at least,

     trying: Alan pauses between eye appointments to record an

     idea.

     William continues scribbling at the restaurant, this time

     eyeing WAITRESS #2.

     Hannah, sitting cross-legged on her bed, types away on her

     laptop computer.

     Colette sits on her private bench, seeking inspiration.

     John sits at his keyboard. Vintage black-and-white war movie

     plays on the TV. John appears more interested in the movie.

     Henry stares at his laptop. The screen is blank. Henry

     surrenders yet again and flips off the computer.

35   INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                       35

     Henry, sitting in his studio apartment, wears his pizza

     delivery outfit. Ready for work. Talks to the camera.

                           HENRY

               I'm happy for Hannah.

                           (MORE)

                                                                  22.

                           HENRY (CONT'D)

               Still, her getting an agent sort of

               ruins my plans, doesn't it? I mean,

               Hannah has an agent. I don't. That

               won't work for dating. I can't ask

               her out until I get an agent.

     Henry gestures at a PHOTOGRAPH taped to the wall among his

     rejection letters.

                           HENRY (CONT'D)

               That's Richard Benedict. He's written

               seven novels. Fantastic writer.

     INSERT ARCHIVAL PHOTOS of Richard Benedict.

                           HENRY (CONT'D)

               The Fitzgerald of his generation.

               Richard Benedict made me want to be

               a writer.

36   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM - DAY                 36

     Colette dressed in a leotard, practices basic yoga on a mat

     in her living room. Chanting. Overly dramatic, as always.

     Takes a break and talks to the camera.

                           COLETTE

               My novel is called Nyet, Not Yet.

               It's about a Russian woman who comes

               to this country in search of love.

               It was inspired by a story I heard

               from one of my massage clients, Yuri.

               Yes, it's true--I used to do massage.

               In fact, that's how I met Alan, though

               I certainly didn't give him the kind

               of massage he really wanted. At least

               not the first time.

     Colette allows herself a slight smile at the memory.

                           COLETTE (CONT'D)

               I will get an agent. It comes down

               to this: if Hannah can get an agent,

               I can get an agent. After all, I am

               a graduate of Mills College.

37   INT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT - DAY                                      37

     Plopped down in her rocking chair, Hannah talks to someone

     O.S. Maureen goes about her day in the background.

                                                          23.

                      HANNAH

          Have I thought of my favorite author

          yet? No. Not yet. There are so

          many, you know?

The deep breaths and waving of hands begin again. Here comes

that smile as she looks directly into the camera.

                      HANNAH (CONT'D)

          So. I am somewhat superstitious.

          Yes. Guilty. I'm drawn to the number

          4. I was born at exactly 4:04 p.m.

          on April 4th. 4-4-4-4. That wasn't

          an accident. No way.

She's dead serious.

                      HANNAH (CONT'D)

          Certain things I've learned to avoid.

          Black cats. Cracked mirrors. Oh.

          And the number 13 especially. I hate

          the number 13. Hate it.

Conversation interrupted by RINGING DOORBELL. Hannah frowns

at the interruption as Maureen scurries to the door and opens

it, revealing Colette hiding behind a HUGE GIFT BASKET. She

breezes in. Takes over. Over the top.

                      COLETTE

          Hi...Hi...Hello everyone. I was

          just in the neighborhood and--

Colette freezes when she notices the camera.

                      COLETTE (CONT'D)

          Oh, Hannah. I'm so sorry. I didn't

          know they'd be here--

Yeah, right. Hannah springs up. Follows Colette as she sets

the basket down for all to admire.

                        HANNAH

          Colette.    What a lovely surprise!

Hugs all around between Hannah and Maureen and Colette.

Hannah looks blown away by the gift basket.

                      HANNAH (CONT'D)

          My, what's this?

                      COLETTE

          Oh. It's nothing. I just had to

          say "Congratulations" to my new

          favorite author.

                                                            24.

Hannah is truly touched.    Maureen notices a CARD attached to

the basket.

                      MAUREEN

              (Reading)

          "For Poodles...Now may we have sex

          again? Love, Alan."

What? Embarrassed, Colette snatches the card from Maureen.

Hannah is more focused on the gift. Doesn't really hear.

                      HANNAH

          So sweet of you, Colette.

                         COLETTE

          My pleasure.     Say, Hannah...about

          your agent?

Hannah looks over at Colette: What?

                      COLETTE (CONT'D)

          Is he--Is he taking on new clients?

                       HANNAH

          Gee.   I don't really know.

Colette blurts out without thinking.

                      COLETTE

          Think you could ask?

Awkward situation for Hannah.      How best to respond?

                         HANNAH

          I guess so.     Maybe.

                      COLETTE

          Because if he is...

                       HANNAH

          Let's talk about this at group

          meeting, OK?

                      COLETTE

          Oh. Of course. Of course.

          Absolutely.

Long beat. Conversation over. The three women wait for one

another to speak. Colette checks her watch.

                         COLETTE (CONT'D)

          Well...

A hug for both Maureen and Hannah.

                                                                 25.

                           COLETTE (CONT'D)

               I've got to go. Talk soon. By the

               way, everything in the basket--gluten

               free!

     A final wave to the camera and Colette disappears.

                           MAUREEN

               Colette Mooney. My, that woman is

               something else.

     A light goes off in Hannah's head.

                           HANNAH

                   (To herself; counting

                    on her fingers)

               Colette Mooney. C-o-l-e-t-t-e M-o-o-

               n-e...

     She can't finish the count. The ugly truth is staring her in

     the face.

                             HANNAH (CONT'D)

               13 letters.    Oh, dear...

     Hannah and Maureen exchange concerned looks.

38   INT. ALAN'S OFFICE   DAY                                          38

     Hannah and Henry sit together in the reception area. Alan

     breezes in, ever-smiling, greeting both enthusiastically.

39   INT. ALAN'S OFFICE - DAY                                          39

     Rows of EYE GLASSES on display as Alan guides Hannah over to

     the fitting table. Henry tags along.

                           HANNAH

               Thanks for seeing me today, Alan.

                           ALAN

               No problemo. Let's get you some new

               eye wear.

                           HANNAH

               Something that makes me look smart.

                           HENRY

               You're already smart, Hannah.

     Hannah gives Henry's hand a playful squeeze: Thank you.

     Alan and Hannah sit down opposite from each other. Henry

     pulls up a chair to the side. Alan selects a pair. Puts them

     on Hannah.

                                                              26.

                         ALAN

          How about...

Hannah shrugs her blase reaction.

                         HANNAH

          Mmmmmmm.

Alan removes the brown-colored frames.   Studies them for a

second. Then -- inspiration arrives.

                       ALAN

          Excuse me.   One sec.

He reaches inside his coat pocket for his RECORDER. Speaks

into it.

                      ALAN (CONT'D)

          Ah. Name for character. Alexander

          Brown. Wears brown-colored glasses.

                      HANNAH

          Of course he would.

Henry nods, agreeing. Satisfied, Alan puts the recorder

away and reaches for another pair of glasses.

                      ALAN

          You know this great idea for a novel

          hit me this morning. It's called

          Unleashed.

Alan tries the second pair on Hannah. She checks herself in

the mirror. Then she shows Henry. They both shake their head:

No. It is a funny moment between friends. They laugh as Alan

reaches for pair #3.

                      ALAN (CONT'D)

          It's about a dog who becomes human

          for 24 hours in order to rescue his

          kidnapped owner. I love this idea,

          Hannah.

                      HANNAH

          Could be a winner.

Alan puts the third pair of glasses on Hannah. She checks

herself in the mirror, finally liking what she sees. She

looks over towards Henry.

                      HANNAH (CONT'D)

          What do you think?

Poor Henry. She does look good. He's falling even harder for

her by the moment.

                                                               27.

                           HENRY

               You look great, Hannah.

     Hannah can't decide. She studies herself in the mirror as

     Henry studies her. Henry reaches for his ANDROID and snaps

     a photo of her. Alan brings them back to real time.

                           ALAN

               Question: You think your agent might

               be interested in this idea? Does he

               have a dog?

                           HANNAH

                   (Evading)

               Oh. I don't know--

                           ALAN

               How about a cat? It could be a cat.

                            HANNAH

               Um. Sure.   Probably could be.

                           ALAN

               Think about mentioning it to your

               agent, OK? Unleashed. Dog -- or cat --

               becomes human.

     Alan beams with pride at his imagination on display. Hannah

     fidgets. Avoids Alan. Henry jumps in to save the moment.

                           HENRY

               I'll help you develop the idea, Alan.

     Alan looks pleased. Hannah looks grateful.

40   INT. RESTAURANT #1 - DAY                                        40

     The TWO MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN (CUSTOMER #1 AND CUSTOMER #2) sit

     across from each other in the nearly-deserted restaurant.

     Body language suggests an intense, passionate, personal chat.

                           WILLIAM (V.O.)

               A writer has to hear everything. On

               the streets. In the restaurants.

     But something's amiss. Customer #1 stops abruptly, glancing

     at the table next to them: William has suddenly materialized.

     Sitting with a cup of coffee and a legal pad, scribbling.

                           WILLIAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

               My dialogue has to be real so I'm

               everywhere. Standing behind you at

               the checkout stand.

                                                             28.

Customer #1 resumes conversation, but looks sharply back at

William. His head is tilted towards them. Listening.

                      WILLIAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

          Peeing next to you at the urinal. I

          watch. I listen.

Customer #1 says something to Customer #2. Looks back at

William. His head is still cocked as he makes notes.

                      WILLIAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

          Writing down scraps of conversation.

Customer #1 grows more agitated. Customer #2 tries to calm

her down. Finally, Customer #1 shoots up and marches over

to William, her finger jabbing in the air towards the

notebook. William shrugs, playing dumb.

                      WILLIAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

          That's right. I eavesdrop.

Customer #1 reaches down and grabs the notebook from William.

He tries to stop her, but too late.

                      WILLIAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

          How else do you accurately capture

          the misery of the human condition?

She reads the page and shows it to Cutomer #2 who reads the

notes and is equally shocked.

                      WILLIAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

          Now Bukowski says "An intellectual

          says a simple thing in a hard way."

The two women start yelling at William. He keeps shaking his

head. Customer #1 tears the page into shreds.

                       WILLIAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

          "An artist says a hard thing in a

          simple way."

Waitress #2 comes over. The women talk to her and she starts

yelling at William. Customer #1 poking her finger in his

chest. Escalates to a push. The COOK comes out and starts

yelling at William.

                      WILLIAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

          Gotta love it. That's me. Simple.

          Real.

Surrounded by yelling people, William breaks through the

circle and moves towards the door. The BUS BOY yells, too.

                                                                  29.

                            WILLIAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

               Powerful.   An artist.

41   EXT. JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY                                      41

     John grins for the camera. The reason why sits next to him

     in the matching LAWN CHAIRS.

     The WOMAN is clearly younger than John. Plainly dressed in a

     faded sweat shirt. Little makeup. Nervous in front of the

     camera, but she looks more at us than she does at John. He

     can't keep his eyes off her.

     CAPTION: SIGRID HAGENGUTH

                           JOHN

               Meet someone very s-p-e-c-i-e-l.

               Here with us today all the way from...

     Coaxing Sigrid to finish the thought.

                            SIGRID

               Germany.

                           JOHN

               Oh! That accent! Found her    working

               at the hardware store. Went   in for a

               drill bit. Came out with a    prime

               candidate for Mrs. John K.    Butzin.

42   INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY                                          42

     Watch Sigrid work. Hard. Uber hard. Stocking shelves. Running

     cash register. Consulting HER BOSS -- an older man.

     Assisting customers. Moving boxes. Always wearing a red

     employee vest. She does speak with a thick accent. Sincere,

     if naive.

                           SIGRID

                   (Starts speaking

                    German. Stops. In

                    English)

               Apologies. American only. I come

               from Dusseldorf, yes? Came to this

               great country 90 years ago -- no, 90

               days ago. Apologies. Took job in

               store as cleaning lady. Promoted to

               cashier. Now assistant, assistant

               manager.

43   INT. JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY                                      43

     Sigrid stands next to a wall display. Everything and anything

     to do with the U.S. is hanging on this wall: Magazine covers

     of Obama. A U.S. flag. Burger King logo. Photo of Jay Leno.

                                                                  30.

     N.Y. Yankees pennant. Whatever comes to mind for the U.S.

     seems to be taped, tacked, glued or whatever to that wall.

                            SIGRID

                This my 'Wall of America' tribute,

                yes? To my new country. And in the

                center, of course, the three men I

                admire most in America.

     First we see the FRAMED PHOTO of a certain business mogul.

                              SIGRID (CONT'D)

                Herr Trump.    Very rich. Very famous.

                Very sexy.

     Then we move on to the second PHOTO of a certain TV celebrity.

                            SIGRID (CONT'D)

                Herr Simon Cowell. Very rich. Very

                famous. Very sexy.

     Move on to the third PHOTO.     Hey, we know this person:

                            SIGRID (CONT'D)

                Ja. My special guy. Herr Bootzin.

                About to become very rich. Very

                famous. Already very sexy.

                    (Beat)

                Then maybe Sigrid Hagenguth becomes

                Mrs. John K. Bootzin, ja?

44   EXT.   COLETTE'S GARDEN - DAY                                      44

     Colette sits. Focused on the WHITE ENVELOPE in one hand.

     Alan sits next to her, squeezing her other hand. Photo of

     Oprah on the other side.

                            COLETTE

                I know this is a rejection letter.

                I can't open this. I can't be

                rejected today. I take rejection so

                personally.

                            ALAN

                I bet it's good news.

     She opens the envelope. Peeks inside. No letter. Just the

     SMALLEST POST-IT NOTE flutters out on to the ground. Colette

     picks it up.

                            COLETTE

                "Sorry. Not interested." I knew it.

                How can such a big rejection come

                from such a small piece of paper?

                                                                  31.

     Colette folds the Post-It Note in half--and then in quarters.

     Holding it in her hand, she begins to chant. Alan holds on

     to her hand and pats her on the back. Good husband.

45   INT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT - DAY                                      45

     Hannah and Maureen watch with interest and obvious

     appreciation as Henry, dutifully wearing his uniform, cleans

     their living room carpet.

     Open PIZZA STARZ IBOX on the breakfast bar. Looks like Henry

     has brought dinner, as well. Hannah's iPhone goes off. As a

     courtesy, Henry stops the machine.

                           HANNAH

                   (On phone)

               Hello? Yes. Oh, hi, Brian.

               (LISTENING) Really? (LISTENING) Oh

               my god! Oh my god! Oh my god!

     Hannah starts jumping up and down like a little girl while

     Maureen and Henry look on in bewildered anticipation.

                           HANNAH (CONT'D)

                   (On phone)

               Oh my god!

                           MAUREEN

               What's he saying?

                           HANNAH

               He sold my novel.

                            HENRY

               What?

                           HANNAH

                   (Nodding excitedly)

               Brian sold Sleeping on the Moon!

     Now Maureen starts jumping up and down. Henry can't hide his

     surprise.

                            MAUREEN

               Oh my god!   Oh my god!

                           HANNAH

                   (On telephone)

               Yes, Brian. I will. Thank you.

               Thank you. Thank you. I will.

               Promise. Thank you!

     Hannah turns off her iPhone. Mother and daughter can't

     believe the news. Jumping up and down. Warm embrace.

                                                                32.

     In turn, they both embrace Henry, who also shares the

     genuine, sincere moment.

                           HENRY

               You did it, Hannah!   You did it!

                           MAUREEN

               I'm so proud of you, dear!

                            HANNAH

               Thank you.

     Another embrace between mother and daughter.   This could go

     on all night.

                           HENRY

               We need to tell the group!

     The smile disappears from Hannah's face.

                           HANNAH

               The group. Oh, dear. The group. No,

               no, I can't tell them about this.

                            HENRY

               Why not?

                            HANNAH

               Oh.

     She looks to Maureen for support.

                           HANNAH (CONT'D)

               It will seem like I'm bragging or

               something. I mean I'm the one with

               an agent. Now this. It could be

               too much, too soon, don't you think?

     Henry understands.   He wants to help.

                           HENRY

               Suppose I tell them? They could hear

               the news from me.

     Hannah lights up at the suggestion. She goes to Henry and

     gives him a tight hug. So very tight. Blesses him with another

     friendly peck on the lips.

                           HANNAH

               Thank you, my friend. I can always

               depend on you, can't I?

46   INT. JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY                                    46

     John talks to the camera.

                                                                  33.

                           JOHN

               That's great for Hannah, her little

               book deal, and all. But John K.

               Butzin has some news to announce, as

               well.

     John holds up a BROCHURE.

                           JOHN (CONT'D)

               I've just inked a deal with U R the

               Publisher, a reputable company based

               in New Delhi. They publish 5000 titles

               internationally every year. Paying

               'em two hundred dollars and they're

               going to format and publish my novel

               Roaring Lion. I've waited for this

               moment forever. Finally, a Butzin

               is going to be a published author.

     A voice drifts in from another room.

                           SIGRID (O.S.)

               Yoo-hoo. Mr. Published-Author-to-Be.

               Sigrid would like you to come in for

               personal, private autograph. Please.

               Please.

     John gulps. Then he remembers the camera.    Makes a "cut"

     motion with his finger across the neck.

47   INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                     47

     Henry's turn to host the group meeting. Alan, William,

     Colette, and John share the lumpy couch and the folding metal

     chairs. Open PIZZA STARZ BOXES in the background.

     Everyone is enjoying a single slice of pizza off a paper

     plate--except for John, who is inhaling two pieces at once.

     The mood is somber. Quiet.

                           WILLIAM

               Hannah's just lucky. That's all.

     John tries to agree, but his mouth is too stuffed with pizza.

     Cheap FLOWERS from Ralph's and BALLOONS in full display on

     the coffee table. Henry stands--listening--by the front

     door.

                           HENRY

               Here she comes!

     Henry opens the door. Hannah floats in.

     The serious expressions suddenly, magically, turn to broad

     smiles. Henry is the first to offer a hug.

                                                            34.

Alan, William, Colette, John give her a standing ovation.

Hannah notices the balloons and flowers.

                        HANNAH

          Ohhhhhh.    For me? You shouldn't have.

                      WILLIAM

          Way to go, Ms. Published Author!

Everyone gets a hug from Hannah. William gives Hannah an

extra long hug.

                      ALAN

          We're all jealous, Hannah. Just

          teasing.

                       COLETTE

          No.   Seriously. We're all jealous.

Nervous laughter around the room.

                      HANNAH

          You're all making too much of a

          spectacle here.

                      HENRY

          When will your book come out, Hannah?

                        HANNAH

          A year.    Takes about a year.

                      WILLIAM

          So how much did you get?

                      ALAN

          Don't ask her that.

                      WILLIAM

              (Shrugging)

          Why not? How much did you get?

                      HANNAH

          I did OK. Leave it at that. What's

          important is that I owe this success

          to all of you. I would be lost without

          this writing group.

                      JOHN

              (Louder than normal)

          I don't know if anyone heard.

All eyes turn to John, still inhaling pizza.

                                                               35.

                           JOHN (CONT'D)

               But U.R. the Publisher has agreed to

               publish Roaring Lion by John K.

               Butzin.

     Puzzled looks are the reaction.

                           ALAN

               U.R. the Publisher?

                           HENRY

               They self-publish. E-books. Print on

               Demand.

                           JOHN

               That's right, Obert. But I'll have

               my book in two weeks. None of this

               B.S. waiting around. John K. Butzin

               will be a published author. And be

               published first.

                           HANNAH

                   (Ever-diplomatic)

               Well, John. Congratulations.

     She leans over and gives him the briefest of hugs. There are

     other congratulatory murmurs coming from the group.

                           ALAN

               My, two published authors in the

               group. The rest of us are going to

               have to catch up.

48   INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                  48

     The meeting gets down to business. Alan, Colette, Henry,

     William and Hannah, wearing her new glasses, listen as John

     reads from Roaring Lion.

                           JOHN

                   (Reading)

               Gunner stared out over the bleak

               horizon, seeing one dead Viet Cong

               after another lay scattered on the

               bloody hillside. He had won this

               time, but Gunner knew Charlie would

               be back in the morning. By god, he

               would be ready. So would his M60

               General Purpose Machine Gun and Mark

               2 Fragmentation/Hand Rifle Grenade.

     John finishes and sits back in his chair, quite pleased with

     himself.

                                                            36.

                      ALAN

          OK, John. Nicely done. Let's get

          some feedback.

Henry, as always, has been making notes.

                       HENRY

          Well.   In terms of the characters--

                       JOHN

               (Jumping in)

          --Hold on, Obert. I wanna hear from

          her.

John points towards Hannah.

                      ALAN

          We'll hear from everybody.

                      JOHN

          I don't want to hear from everybody.

          She has a book coming out. John K.

          Butzin has a book coming out. I want

          to hear from Hannah, author to author.

                      WILLIAM

          Oh, screw you.

                      ALAN

          This is really going against the

          spirit of the group, John. Everyone's

          opinion is valid.

                      JOHN

          Hers is more valid. What'd you think,

          Hannah? Tell me.

Hannah struggles to speak. Clearly uncomfortable.

                       HANNAH

          I-I . . .

The words freeze in her mouth. Awkward silence. Finally.

                      WILLIAM

              (Standing up)

          Going outside for a smoke.

William thunders away from the group. Colette watches him

go.

                      COLETTE

          I'll go talk to him.

Colette follows, calling after William.

                                                                  37.

                           ALAN

               Let's take a fifteen minute break,

               shall we?

     Embarrassed, Hannah excuses herself. Henry trails along after

     her, leaving a muttering John and calm Alan alone. Alan

     reaches for his recorder. Talks into it.

                           ALAN (CONT'D)

               Ahhh, idea for Michael Crichton-type

               novel. Members of Antarctic research

               station attacked by mutant penguins.

     Satisfied, Alan turns off the recorder while John reaches

     for more pizza.

49   EXT. COLETTE'S GARDEN - DAY                                        49

     Colette is back on her bench. Standing behind her is a

     mysterious MAN (Over 40) who favors black clothes and dark

     shades.

     CAPTION: DR. XIROMAN

                           COLETTE

               I want you to meet someone special.

               This is my spiritual adviser. Doctor

               Xiroman has taken a vow of silence

               for one full year to protest climate

               change. What an amazing man. Dr.

               Xiroman is going to cleanse the air

               of all this rejection.

     Camera goes to Dr. Xiroman. Somber, expressionless. Does he

     even have a pulse?

     Dr. Xiroman walks over to small fire pit and meditates as he

     places his hands over the rising flames. Colette begins a

     New Age chant for added support.

50   INT. RESTAURANT #2 - DAY                                           50

     THREE YOUNG MEN in the corner booth. Jeans and baseball caps.

     Very animated conversation. Loud, punctuated by laughter.

     They think they're the only people in the joint. The WAITRESS--

     EUDORA (20's)--with the purple streaks in her hair and

     matching purple glasses, refills their cups.

     William sits alone at the counter, impossible to hide his

     disdain. He talks to the camera with the three men in the

     background.

                           WILLIAM

               See those jokers back there?

                           (MORE)

                                                                38.

                           WILLIAM (CONT'D)

               They "write" for TV. Town's full of

               them. Creative vultures. Anything

               for a paycheck. Fade in. Fade out.

               C.S.I. 24. Who Wants to Suck My --

     William scoffs as the disdain drips from his mouth.

                           WILLIAM (CONT'D)

               Gimme a break. Television. Telecrap.

               They've sold their souls to the devil.

               For what? A house in Malibu? A tennis

               court?

     William glances over his shoulder, shaking his head in

     disgust. Another table catches his eye. TWO ATTRACTIVE WOMEN

     engage in friendly banter over coffee. William stares them

     down, making friendly eye contact.

     The woman facing him returns eye contact. She smiles.   William

     smiles, watching them as he continues.

                           WILLIAM (CONT'D)

               That will never be me. I will never

               compromise my vision for financial

               gain. I'd rather borrow money from

               friends than sell out for a quick

               dollar.

     The two women stand up. William is stoked. This is too easy.

     But the women instead go to the three TV writers. Immediately

     invited to sit down with them.

     William can't believe it.   What the...

                           HENRY (V.O.)

               "...Gatsby had an extraordinary gift

               for hope, a romantic readiness...

51   INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                      51

     Henry reads from The Great Gatsby.

                           HENRY

               "...such as I have never found in

               any other person and which it is not

               likely I shall ever find again..."

     Henry is always moved whenever he reads Fitzgerald.   Putting

     down the book, he talks to the camera.

                           HENRY (CONT'D)

               You know, the year before he died,

               F.

                           (MORE)

                                                               39.

                            HENRY (CONT'D)

                Scott Fitzgerald made a grand total

                of $13.13 in royalties from his

                writing. I guess Hannah's right

                about 13 being unlucky.

     A question is asked O.S. Henry listens.

                            HENRY (CONT'D)

                Sure. Sure. I know that. Gatsby

                does end tragically. But that's

                fiction. Hannah...She's real. Our

                story will have a happy ending.

     Pause.   Henry rethinks.

                             HENRY (CONT'D)

                Maybe.   Maybe a happy ending.

     His confidence flies out the door.

                            HENRY (CONT'D)

                Hope. Hope we have a happy ending.

                Fingers crossed.

52   INT. ALAN & COLETTE'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM - DAY                52

     Alan and Colette hold court on their living room couch,

     talking to the camera.

                            ALAN

                There's been one rule in this house.

                Whatever Colette wants, Colette gets.

                            COLETTE

                Thank you, Alan.

     They look at each other adoringly.   Real or fake?

                            ALAN

                She wants a Mercedes? No problem.

                Credit cards? How many? Her own

                business? Done. An agent?

     Colette eats it up.

                            ALAN (CONT'D)

                Call it karma or serendipity or

                kismet. Whatever. But it just so

                happens that very well-known literary

                agent David Keller--

                            COLETTE

                    (Interrupting)

                --Very well-known. He's so known.

                                                                  40.

                           ALAN

               Exactly. Well, guess who is coming

               in tomorrow to see Dr. Alan Mooney

               for an eye examination and new

               glasses?

     Colette starts squealing in anticipation. Alan nods with

     confidence and flashes a "thumbs up."

                           COLETTE

               I love you, Poodles.

                           ALAN

               Love you more, Poodles.

53   INT. ALAN'S OFFICE - DAY                                           53

     The casually dressed MAN (40's) sits in the waiting area for

     Alan Mooney, spending time on his iPhone, conducting business

     as he waits.

     CAPTION: DAVID KELLER

     He doesn't have to wait long. Alan personally comes out

     into the waiting area to fetch him. Big grin. Hand extended.

                           ALAN

               Dr. Alan Mooney.

     David, caught off guard by the doctor's sudden appearance,

     winds up his phone conversation.

                           DAVID

                   (on phone)

               Let me call you back.

     David stands up.

                           DAVID (CONT'D)

               David Keller.

     They shake hands.

                           ALAN

               I know. Big fan. Big fan.

     David can't help but notice the camera.

                           ALAN (CONT'D)

               Oh, that. They're doing a little

               documentary about my writing group.

                             DAVID

               Really?

                                                                  41.

                           ALAN

               Just act natural.

     Lowering his voice.

                           ALAN (CONT'D)

               It was supposed to be a reality

               series.

54   INT. ALAN'S OFFICE -- EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY                       54

     Standard examination room. Alan guides David into the chair.

                           ALAN

               Great. Let's start out with a basic

               eye examination.

     Alan flips a couple SWITCHES. Eye reading CHART appears on

     the wall. Alan turns off the lights.

                           ALAN (CONT'D)

               OK, David. See if you can read that

               first line for me, please.

                         DAVID

                           ALAN

               Very good, David. Would you like to

               try for what's behind Door Number

               Three? Try this one, please.

     Alan brings up a different line on the screen.

                         DAVID

               20/25. Looking good, David. But

               anyone can identify simple letters

               and numbers. Let's see how you do

               reading a more challenging text.

     Alan brings up a different page. Several paragraphs on a

     printed page.

                           ALAN (CONT'D)

               See that?

                           DAVID

               Yes.

                                                             42.

                      ALAN

          Good. Read me the first paragraph,

          please.

          Oh. Very nice. Very nice. Now the

          next paragraph, please.

David looks rather puzzled, but complies.

                      DAVID

              (Reading; monotone)

          "I never, ever thought I could feel

          this way," Natasha said excitedly.

          "Nor could I," Yuri said happily,

          his body dripping with enormous beads

          of sweat.

                      ALAN

          Man. Wow. Gee. Isn't that great

          writing? My wife Colette wrote that.

          The patients just love reading her

          stuff. It's from her new novel,

          Nyet, Not Yet.

A loud KNOCK on the examination room door. David is saved by

the bell.

                      ALAN (CONT'D)

          My, I wonder who that could be.

He walks over to the door, opens it and feigns surprise to

see Colette. She moves right in.

                       COLETTE

          Hi, honey.   So sorry to intrude.

                      ALAN

          Colette? Gee, this is an incredible

          coincidence. We were just talking

          about you. And here you are!

Colette is locked like a laser beam on David Keller.

                      COLETTE

              (Gushing)

          Hello.

                                                                43.

                           ALAN

               Oh, where are my manners? Colette,

               this is David Keller. David, this is

               my wife, Colette Mooney. The writer.

                           DAVID

               Hi.

                           COLETTE

               Pleasure to meet you, David.

                            ALAN

               Actually, Colette wrote this beautiful

               prose you've been reading, David.

               Honey, I can't believe this

               coincidence.

                           COLETTE

               Well, I was just dropping off--

                           ALAN

                   (Overlapping)

               Oh, of course. Thanks for bringing

               it by. Say, honey, David's been

               reading that first page of yours.

               You don't happen to have any more of

               that opening chapter, do you?

     Colette thinks for a second.

                           COLETTE

               As a matter of fact, I think I do. I

               think I do.

     Colette searches her large PURSE and produces a manila folder.

                           ALAN

               Say, how about that?

     Colette hands the manila folder to David, who accepts it

     reluctantly. He's been had.

                           DAVID

               How about that?

55   INT. ALAN'S OFFICE -- EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY                     55

     Colette sits in the chair, Alan stands behind her, massaging

     her shoulders. Both share that smirk of satisfaction.

                           COLETTE

               That went very well.

                           ALAN

               Oh, yes, Poodles.    Very.

                                                                  44.

                           COLETTE

               Though David Keller did seem in a

               hurry to leave.

                           ALAN

               The sooner he can begin reading.

     Colette buys that.    Of course.

                           COLETTE

               I bet he calls tomorrow with an offer.

                           ALAN

               I bet he calls tonight.

     Alan's left hand starts to slide down towards Colette's chest.

     She doesn't notice--her mind is elsewhere.

56   EXT. OUTSIDE ALAN'S OFFICE - DAY                                   56

     DAVID takes Colette's pages and tosses them in city TRASH

     CAN, muttering to himself as he walks away.

                           COLETTE (V.O.)

                   (Overlapping Alan)

               I did it.

                           ALAN (V.O.)

                   (Overlapping Colette)

               We did it.

57   INT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT - DAY                                      57

     Hannah sits cross-legged on her living room floor, wearing

     her new glasses, reading typed pages. Henry sits close to

     her. Not too close. Waiting. Hannah finishes. Impressed.

                              HANNAH

               Henry.     This is good.   So good.

                              HENRY

               Really?

     Hannah nods.   Really.

                           HENRY (CONT'D)

               But I've only got 100 pages.      Can't

               seem to move forward.

                           HANNAH

               I'm dying to know more about Scott

               and Christy. What great characters.

                                                                  45.

                           HENRY

               Yeah. Sure wish I knew what was going

               to happen with them.

     Hannah gives Henry a friendly tap on the knee for

     encouragement.

                           HANNAH

               You'll figure it out, Henry. It'll

               pass. Focus on your writing. No

               distractions. The writing comes first.

     Henry lets it sink in.   Changes the subject.

                           HENRY

               Say, um, remember I offered to drive

               you around and show you a couple

               special places?

58   EXT. RICHARD BENEDICT HOME - DAY                                   58

     The imposing house screams success.     Henry and Hannah sit in

     Henry's parked car, taking it in.

                           HANNAH

               Who lives here?

                           HENRY

               Richard Benedict.

                            HANNAH

               Oh.   That writer you like?

                           HENRY

               Like? No. It's much more than that.

               Wow. He...He...

     Henry struggles to put it into words.

                           HENRY (CONT'D)

               ...Reading Richard Benedict...made

               me want to be a better writer. He's

               that good, Hannah.

                           HANNAH

               Can't say I've read his stuff.     Nice

               house, though.

59   EXT. FITZGERALD/GRAHAM HOME - DAY                                  59

     Henry and Hannah stand on the sidewalk in front of the North

     Hayworth home. Henry seems barely able to contain his

     excitement.

                                                          46.

                         HENRY

          Here we are.

Hannah stares blankly at the house.

                      HENRY (CONT'D)

          North Hayworth Avenue. Hollywood,

          California.

Hannah smiles politely, but it's clear she doesn't recognize

the house.

                      HENRY (CONT'D)

          Big clue time. Sheila Graham.

Still nothing registers with Hannah.

                      HENRY (CONT'D)

          OK. Give up? Writer Sheila Graham

          lived here. Fitzgerald was her lover.

          This is where he died on December

          21, 1940.

Hannah lets it all sink in.

                      HANNAH

          Fitzgerald? He's the one who shot

          himself, right?

                      HENRY

          No. Fitzgerald. F. Scott Fitzgerald.

          He wrote The Great Gatsby.

The name doesn't register with Hannah.

                      HENRY (CONT'D)

              (Reciting from heart)

          Gatsby believed in the green light,

          the orgiastic future that year by

          year recedes before us. It eluded us

          then, but that's--

                      HANNAH

              (Interjecting)

          I've never read it.

Henry can't hide his surprise.

                         HENRY

          What?

Hannah stops, cognizant of the ever-present camera.

                                                           47.

                      HANNAH

              (To camera)

          Could you turn that off for a few

          minutes, please?

                      HENRY

          You know they can't. What's wrong?

Hannah hesitates.   Counts to three. Lowers her voice.

                      HANNAH

          I've never read The Great Gatsby.

                      HENRY

          You're kidding.

                      HANNAH

          Henry. I never went to college.

          I've heard of Hemingway. A little.

          Fitzgerald. Somewhere. But I don't

          have your education. Your smarts. I

          haven't read all these great novels.

          My stories come from my heart.

Henry lets it all sink in.    Hannah looks at the house.

                      HANNAH (CONT'D)

          Tell me about the book.

                      HENRY

          Gatsby is about social position and

          the American Dream and . . .

Henry stops. Rethinks his explanation.

                      HENRY (CONT'D)

          Actually, it's quite simple. Boy

          meets girl. Boy loses girl. Boy

          moves heaven and earth to win the

          girl back.

                      HANNAH

          And it's your favorite?

Henry nods with his heart.

                      HANNAH (CONT'D)

          So how does it end? Does boy get the

          girl?

Long beat. Then Henry reaches into the back seat of his car

for his KNAPSACK. Puts it on his lap, unzips it. Pulls out

his personal copy of Gatsby.

                                                                  48.

                           HENRY

               Here. Take my copy.

     He hands the well-read book to Hannah.

                           HENRY (CONT'D)

               Now you can find out for yourself.

60   INT. JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY                                      60

     John is on the telephone, clutching a copy of Roaring Lion.

     He does not look happy.

                           JOHN

                   (On telephone)

               Yes. I'm still holding. Where are

               you again? New Dehli? Oh.

     John stares at his book, shaking his head. Waits for a few

     seconds.

     Sigrid is in the background, doing light housekeeping, trying

     not to listen, but obviously can't avoid it.

                           JOHN (CONT'D)

                   (On telephone)

               Butzin. John K. Butzin. Right. That's

               me. Roaring Lion. Yes. Well, I

               have a copy of my book you sent, but

               there must be some mistake...Well,

               you put a dog on the cover. Not a

               lion like we agreed.

     John holds the book up for the camera to catch the

     unmistakable dog barking on the front cover.

                           JOHN (CONT'D)

                   (On telephone)

               Plus the back cover is written in

               Chinese. Chinese...Yes, I know

               Chinese when I see it. One of those

               Chinese assault rifles almost cost

               me an eye at Hamburger Hill...

     John listens--trying to remain calm.

                           JOHN (CONT'D)

               I seem to be missing pages 1-0-7 to

               1-1-2...Yes, I'm sure. And what in

               blazes is this Chapter Eight?

     Sigrid keeps cleaning.   Stoic expression.

                                                                    49.

                           JOHN (CONT'D)

                   (On telephone)

               This Chapter Eight isn't mine. It's

               about hormone replacement for women.

               Do you think John K. Butzin would

               write that? Must be from another

               goddamn book. So what the hell you

               going to do about this? You, sir,

               are dealing with a decorated veteran--

               a combat veteran--of the United States

               Army.

     John waits for an explanation.

                           JOHN (CONT'D)

               Yes. I'll hold.

     John looks again at his book in disbelief. Then he remembers

     the camera. Forces a faint smile.

                           JOHN (CONT'D)

                   (To camera)

               Minor details. That's all. All that

               truly matters is that John K. Butzin

               is finally a published author.

     But catch Sigrid's expression. She is quiet.     More than a

     little concerned at what she is hearing.

61   INT. RESTAURANT #2 - DAY                                             61

     Henry and Hannah at a table, sharing coffee. Eudora the

     waitress swings by with a refill, hair purple as ever. Hannah

     thumbs through her copy of Gatsby, looking interested. And

     pleased. Eudora notices the book.

                             EUDORA

               Great book.    Classic.

     Henry nods in agreement.   Eudora moves on.

                           HANNAH

               Oh, I needed this break. Thank you,

               Henry.

                           HENRY

               You're welcome.

                           HANNAH

               It's just that I'm starting to feel

               the pressure, you know? There is so

               much riding on this first book.

                                                                 50.

                           HENRY

               Don't be silly. Sleeping on the

               Moon will hit the bestseller list.

               You'll be the toast of the literary

               world. And I'll come over to Beverly

               Hills and deliver a pizza to you.

                           HANNAH

               Beverly Hills, ah...

                             HENRY

               Definitely.

62   EXT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT / CITY STREET - DAY                       62

     Parked on the street in front of Hannah's apartment. Henry

     and Hannah, this mutual admiration society, stand by the

     car. Hannah still has her copy of Gatsby. Short beat.

                           HANNAH

               What a dear, sweet friend you are.

     Hannah graces Henry with another hug. Another quick peck on

     the lips. But wait--Henry wants more. He kisses her back.

     More than a peck. Too much more. Hannah, surprised, pulls

     back--her hand on his chest: Stop.

                            HANNAH (CONT'D)

                   (Gently)

               No distractions. The writing comes

               first, 'kay?

     Henry nods reluctantly: Understood. One last hug from Hannah

     before she heads for her front door, smiling back over her

     shoulder at Henry. Henry watches her leave, knowing that

     this was absolutely, positively, the best day of his life.

63   INT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT -- LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                    63

     The writing group meets. Hannah, Henry, John, William, Alan

     and Colette sit around the living room, pages in front of

     them.

     WRITERS AT WORK sign on display.

     Maureen, trying not to be in the way, goes from writer to

     writer, carrying a large TRAY OF VEGGIES.

                            ALAN

               Alright.   Whose turn is it to read?

               Henry?

     All eyes on Henry. He shifts uncomfortably in his chair.

                                                          51.

                      HENRY

          Oh. Um. Someone else go. I don't

          have anything new ready tonight.

Concerned looks all around.

                      COLETTE

          It's been weeks, Henry.

                       HENRY

          I know.   Still can't focus.

                      JOHN

          Don't be a pussy, Obert. Get writing.

          Complete the mission.

                      HANNAH

          Writer's block can be very serious,

          John.

John scoffs in disbelief. Maureen offers William some veggies.

He helps himself and checks out Maureen as she moves on to

Alan.

                      WILLIAM

          What's so hard, bro'? I mean, you've

          got Scott and Christy. Two friends.

          Tell their story.

                      HENRY

          That's the problem. I think the

          story's changing.

                       ALAN

          Changing?   How so?

                      HENRY

          Lately I'm feeling something much

          deeper, much richer. Scott and

          Christy, um, growing closer.

The other group members appear puzzled.

                      COLETTE

          Christy's a beautiful, wealthy author

          in Beverly Hills. How close can they

          get?

                      HENRY

          Follow me. Something happens.

          Christy has an epiphany. She-She

          realizes her feelings run much deeper

          now for Scott.

                                                               52.

Henry does everything he can not to look at Hannah. Short

beat.

                        WILLIAM

          Nah.    Don't buy it.

                      JOHN

          They're friends. Why muck it up?

          Don't put 'em in the same foxhole.

                      COLETTE

          Is this Scott wanting to go beyond

          the friendship? There's no way

          Christy would suggest it. What do

          you think, Hannah?

                      ALAN

          Yes. Hannah, what do you think?

All eyes go back to Hannah.     She does not want to answer.

                      HANNAH

          Gee, I-I guess...I really never

          thought of them that way.

                        HENRY

          Never?

Hannah shakes her head.   Chooses her words carefully.

                      HANNAH

          No. It's always been a friendship.

Henry takes a moment.   Thinking.

                      HENRY

          You don't see anything possibly

          happening between them?

                        HANNAH

          No.    Friends. Nothing more.

                        WILLIAM

          Exactly.

                      HANNAH

          I'd be uncomfortable with any changes

          in the relationship.

Message received. All eyes on Henry. Defeated.

                      HENRY

          OK. Thanks, everyone. I'll try to

          have something on paper next time.

                                                                  53.

                           JOHN

               Remember, Obert. Complete the mission.

64   INT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT -- LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                     64

     Meeting over. Writing group starts breaking up. William

     leans in close by Hannah.

                           WILLIAM

                   (Lowered voice)

               Got a sec?

     William motions Hannah over to the corner of the living room,

     away from the others. She follows, looking puzzled. Henry

     watches with curiosity. William starts speaking to Hannah in

     hushed tones, trying not to let anyone else overhear the

     conversation.

                           HANNAH

               How much?

     More hushed tones from William. Hannah shakes her head.

                           HANNAH (CONT'D)

               But if I loaned you money, then I

               wouldn't have it.

                           WILLIAM

               Hey, I just figured, you know. You

               got that big advance. Help out a

               fellow writer. I'm good for it,

               Hannah.

                           HANNAH

               Sorry. It's bad luck to loan money.

                           WILLIAM

               OK, then, just give it to me.

     Henry makes a point of moving in and standing directly by

     Hannah, staring William down. Henry and Hannah make eye

     contact. Henry looks to her: Are we OK? Hannah looks away.

     Colette comes up next to William.

                           COLETTE

               How much do you need?

     William looks surprised.

65   INT. JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY                                      65

     John sits in his comfortable chair. Sigrid is nearby, at the

     computer. John talks to the camera.

                                                                 54.

                           JOHN

               This is a big moment. Roaring Lion

               has been posted on Amazon.com. Now

               all books. Your fiction. Your

               nonfiction. They're ranked on Amazon

               by sales. Obviously everyone wants

               to be number one. They say a book

               is selling well on Amazon if it's in

               the top 5000. Time to run it up the

               flag pole. Sigrid?

     Nervous, Sigrid takes a deep breath and taps away on the

     computer keys. She waits, focused intently on the screen.

                           SIGRID

                   (Reading slowly aloud)

               2,472,899 . . .

     Silence. Long silence as it all sinks in. John seems suddenly

     uncomfortable. Sigrid types away on the computer keys again.

     Reads off the screen.

                             SIGRID (CONT'D)

               Tom Clancy.    32.

     John discovers a new interest in the ceiling.

66   INT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT - DAY                                     66

     Hannah plops in her chair, upscale SHOPPING BAGS at her feet.

     Maureen hovers in the background.

                           HANNAH

               How am I doing? OK. Sort of. Brian

               called. Looks like there's real

               interest in movie rights for Sleeping

               on the Moon. Yeah, thanks.

     Heavy sigh.   Not excited in the least. Matter-of-fact.

                           HANNAH (CONT'D)

               But I don't dare say anything to the

               group. They find out I've got a

               movie deal--I don't know. I'm sensing

               enough jealousy as it is, you know?

               Could be awkward if they found out.

               It's a real--what's that word?

                             MAUREEN

               Conundrum.

                             HANNAH

               That's it.    I'm in one.

                                                                  55.

67   EXT. JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - NIGHT                                     67

     WRITERS AT WORK poster taped to the front door.

68   INT. JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - NIGHT                                     68

     Full meeting of the writing group, all crammed around the

     dining table. Henry and Hannah sit apart.

     A single BOWL OF PRETZELS has been placed before them. Hannah

     reads from her typed pages. Alan, William, Colette, and Henry

     hang on her every word.

     John is half-listening at best, more interested in the

     MAGAZINE he's thumbing through.

     William REACHES UNDER THE TABLE and gently squeezes Colette's

     hand. Surprised, she pulls her hand away.

                           HANNAH

                   (Reading; with feeling)

               "Please come home, Michael." "Why

               would you want to marry me, Kyra? I

               barely graduated high school."

               "Michael, I don't care about some

               silly college degree. You're the

               most intelligent person I've ever

               known. You are my shining star."

     Then Colette puts it back and squeezes William's hand. It's

     his turn to be surprised.

     Hannah slides off her new reading glasses, waiting for someone

     to react. The room falls silent. Alan steps in.

                            ALAN

               OK.   Comments. Anyone?

     No response. Group members look at the pages.      At each other.

     No one steps forward.

                           HANNAH

               I value your feedback.    We're all in

               this together, right?

     Nobody bites.

                           HANNAH (CONT'D)

               Colette--Did the new scene work for

               you?

     Colette seems thrown by the direct question.

                                                          56.

                      COLETTE

          Oh...Gee...Hannah. What? I mean,

          you're being published. This is

          being published.

                      HANNAH

          But my editor wants rewrites.      Am I

          on track?

Colette punts.   Alan jumps in to save his wife.

                      ALAN

          Of course you are, Hannah.

                      WILLIAM

          You got the deal. You got the check.

          First one to be published.

John CLEARS HIS THROAT rather loudly: What about me, butthead?

William ignores him.

                      ALAN

          I think what I'm hearing from the

          group is...is...you're fine. We all

          love it. Nothing here to critique.

          You don't need us--well, it's not

          that you don't need us, but, you

          know...

Alan's voice trails off before he can dig himself any deeper.

More silence as Hannah wrestles with this unexpected reaction.

Finally looks to Henry for help.

                      HANNAH

          What do you think, Henry?

All eyes on Henry. He hesitates.   Then --

                      HENRY

          Yes. Actually, it is really good,

          but there are a couple things--little

          things--I'd point out. For example--

                      JOHN

          Holy Douglas MacArthur --

All eyes on John. Finally holds up magazine to reveal that

he's been reading VARIETY.

                      JOHN (CONT'D)

              (Reading)

          "Hollywood decides to go sleeping on

          the moon.

                      (MORE)

                                                                  57.

                           JOHN (CONT'D)

               First-time scribe Hannah Rinaldi,

               repped by Brian Barkley of SoHo,

               scores six-figure movie deal. Ink is

               still fresh, but Barkley boasts keen

               interest by..."

     John keeps reading. Various reactions, mostly muted, around

     the table. Can Hannah's face turn any redder?

69   INT. MONTAGE OF SHOTS - NIGHT                                      69

     Members of the writing group struggle to deal with Hannah's

     latest success:

     Alan and Colette sit on their living room couch together,

     wearing matching pajamas, staring straight ahead like zombies.

     His tape recorder sits on the coffee table. Alan reaches

     for it. She grabs it from his hand and throws it.

     William sits at the counter of Restaurant #2, drumming his

     fingers on the legal pad, half-heartedly trying to write.

     WAITRESS #3 pours him some more coffee, trying to make eye

     contact with him. William ignores her.

     John sits in front of his computer screen, but he can't

     concentrate. Gives up. Shuts down computer. Flips on TV.

     Another war movie.

     Henry stares absent-mindedly at his wall of rejection letters.

     Hannah sits at her computer--the only one actually working

     at the moment--but she stops long enough to take a deep,

     deep sigh. A lot weighs on her mind.

70   EXT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- DRIVEWAY - DAY                    70

     Alan arrives home. Steps out of his Lexus. Whistling. Happy-

     go-lucky. Pauses in the driveway to record another idea.

                           ALAN

               Idea for novel. Perhaps screenplay.

               The Amazing Doctor Eckleburg. An eye

               doctor turned crime fighter. Ladies

               man.

71   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM - DAY                 71

     Alan sails through the front door. His smile disappears.

     William is plopped on the living room couch. Shirt half

     unbuttoned. Smoking. He freezes mid-puff.

                           ALAN

               William?

                                                                58.

                               WILLIAM

                Hey.   Alan.

     SOUND OF SHOWER AND COLETTE SINGING OFF-KEY echoes throughout

     the house. Alan turns quiet as he makes the connection.

                            WILLIAM (CONT'D)

                Just, um. Just stopped by to...read

                some pages for Colette. Yeah.

     There are no pages on the coffee table in front of William.

72   EXT. COLETTE'S GARDEN - MOMENTS LATER                            72

     Alan steps outside. Somber. Focused. Acts like the

     Terminator in his scanning of the area. Man on a mission.

     What is he looking for? He finds it almost immediately,

     zeroing in on Colette's bench. Alan marches over and grabs

     Colette's prized framed photo of Oprah. Clutching it in his

     hand, Alan looks at Oprah's smiling face, then back towards

     the house. Then he takes the frame and smashes it down on

     the ground as hard as he can. Next he jumps up and down on

     the smashed frame multiple times. Not satisfied, Alan bends

     down, picks up the photo and rips it to shreds with his hands.

     There. That felt good.

     Pool Guy and Gardener have witnessed the whole scene.    What

     the hell? They exchange puzzled looks.

73   INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                     73

     Henry talks to the camera.

                            HENRY

                Hannah's avoiding me. She doesn't

                respond to emails or voice messages.

                She's "busy." Always an excuse.

74   INT.   HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                   74

     Henry talks to the camera--his concern unmistakable.

                            HENRY

                Things have definitely changed between

                us. I did get to go to her place

                for dinner last night.

75   INT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT - EVENING                                75

     A spruced-up Henry sits down for dinner.   All smiles.

                            HENRY (V.O.)

                Hannah wasn't there. She was in New

                York with her publisher. But Maureen

                and I had a lovely time.

                                                                59.

     Maureen passes Henry more vegetables.

76   EXT. COLETTE'S GARDEN - DAY                                      76

     Colette sits on her private bench. Note the NEW PHOTO OF

     OPRAH in a new frame. Colette talks to the camera.

                           COLETTE

               Yes. You noticed. I replaced the

               photo. I may be replacing other

               things around here soon...I was just

               using William...for research.

     She holds up THREE MORE LETTERS.

                           COLETTE (CONT'D)

               Speaking of rejection...three more

               letters saying Nyet, including one

               from David Keller. I should have

               offered him a massage. How much

               more rejection can I take?

     Colette stares at the letters, focusing on remaining strong.

                           COLETTE (CONT'D)

                   (Reciting)

               "We keep going back, stronger, not

               weaker, because we will not allow--

     Her voice cracks.   She stops.   Fighting for composure

                           COLETTE (CONT'D)

               --Rejection to beat us down--

     Colette's frustration is boiling into anger as she struggles

     to keep it under control.

                           COLETTE (CONT'D)

               --It will only strengthen our resolve.

               To be successful there is no other

               way." Mr. Henry D. Thoreau.

     Short beat.

                           COLETTE (CONT'D)

               Rejection sucks.

77   EXT. COLETTE'S GARDEN - DAY                                      77

     Smoke rises from the fire pit, burning what's left of the

     letters. Colette sits cross-legged, devoting her full energy

     to chanting and beating her hands on a small DRUM.

     It isn't enough today. Watch as Colette's solemn chant

     dissolves into tears of frustration.

                                                                  60.

     Dr. Xiroman places a comforting hand on her shoulder, trying

     to calm Colette down.

78   EXT. JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY                                      78

     Sitting outside in the cheap lawn chairs with Sigrid, John

     addresses the camera. He cleans up pretty good.

                           JOHN

               This is going to be a great day for

               John K. Butzin. Yes, sir. First

               official book signing.

     Sigrid holds up a copy of Roaring Lion. The dog on the cover

     has had an image of a lion slapped over it. Sigrid beams

     with pride.

                           JOHN (CONT'D)

               Ready and raring to go. Of course,

               it would have been better to do this

               in an actual bookstore, but, hell,

               they're dropping faster than Charlie

               at Dak To. Not to worry. Since Sigrid

               works at the hardware store, they're

               going to let her favorite author

               sign a few books there.

                           SIGRID

               More than a few books. Many, many

               books, Ja?

                           JOHN

               Ja, my Strudel. Many books.

79   EXT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY                                          79

     SIGNS in front window announcing hammers, ladders, paint on

     sale. Also a handwritten PIECE OF PAPER taped to the window

     with masking tape, announcing AUTHOR SIGNING.

80   INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY                                          80

     John sits at his card table in the corner. Alone. A stack of

     books sit piled in front of him. CUSTOMERS walk all around,

     ignoring John completely. John tries to stay relaxed, smiling

     and nodding at people, not being too forceful.

     Sigrid, wearing her little red work vest and glasses, stands

     off to the side, beaming with pride. She hurries over to a

     cash register, takes the telephone out of her surprised boss'

     hand, and jumps on the store's PA SYSTEM, blasting throughout

     the store.

                                                                61.

                           SIGRID

                   (On PA system)

               Attention shoppers. Famous author,

               Mr. John K. Bootzin, signing new

               best seller. Up front of store.

               John K. Bootzin. Also, special

               today in plumbing department.

               Ballcocks. Two for one. All

               customers guaranteed will be

               satisfied. Ja.

81   INT. HARDWARE STORE -- DAY                                       81

     The PILE OF BOOKS seems untouched.

82   INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY                                        82

     Still no takers.    Sigrid comes over to console him.

                           JOHN

               Sorry, Strudel. Seem to be shooting

               blanks today.

     John looks past Sigrid. His face brightens. A smiling Alan

     has arrived, flanked by Colette, Henry and Hannah. Hannah

     holds a cupcake. Alan has a bottle of champagne and some

     plastic cups. But there is no touching, no direct

     interaction, between Colette and Alan.

                             ALAN

               Author!    Author!

     John stands up.    Clearly touched.

                           JOHN

               Hey-Hey. The cavalry's arrived.

               Look who's here.

                           SIGRID

               Hello, everyone!

                           HANNAH

               Wouldn't miss your signing, John.

     Hannah presents John with the cupcake and leans in for a

     friendly peck on the cheek. Colette aims her cell phone

     camera at John.

                              COLETTE

               Smile, John!

     John half-smiles in response. Henry reaches over and shakes

     his hand.

                                                                   62.

                           HENRY

               Congratulations, John.

                           JOHN

               Thanks, Obert. Where's the Bukowski

               wannabe?

     Awkward silence as the group members exchange puzzled looks.

                           HANNAH

               William said he'd meet us here.

                              JOHN

               What a turd.     Never liked that punk

               anyway.

                           ALAN

               Maybe he's still at our house.

                              COLETTE

               Maybe he is.     Maybe I should go see.

                           ALAN

               Maybe you should.

     What's that about? Henry studies John's book.       Flips to the

     back cover. Surprised.

                           HENRY

               This is in Chinese.

     All eyes on John. Squirming, he looks over to Sigrid: Help

     me. She thinks for a second.

                           SIGRID

               International edition!

     John nods convincingly in agreement.

                           ALL

                   (Except John and Sigrid)

               Oh...

83   INT. JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY                                       83

     Sigrid sits alone on the couch as John floats in and out of

     camera, humming to himself, dancing like Fred Astaire. John

     is happy. Sigrid seems more subdued. Marked contrast.

     John addresses the camera.

                           JOHN

               Know what the hardware store manager

               said? He said today was their most

               successful book signing. Ever.

                                                               63.

     A question is asked.    John listens.

                           JOHN (CONT'D)

               This was their first book signing?

               Oh.

     Think, John.   Think.

                           JOHN (CONT'D)

               Well, John K. Butzin set the bar

               pretty high for the next writer, let

               me tell ya. That's right: 1-2-3-4-5-

               6-7-8-9-10-11. Eleven books sold.

     Sigrid clears her throat and flashes ten fingers in the air.

                           JOHN (CONT'D)

               Oh, that's right, Strudel. You

               borrowed one at the store to help

               prop open the side door. I forgot.

                             SIGRID

               Ja...

                           JOHN

               Ten books. But there are now at

               least ten homes in California where

               folks have books by Melville.

               Hemingway. Clancy. And now Butzin.

               It's a humbling thought.

     John goes back to his routine. Sigrid offers up a supportive

     smile, but she doesn't seem quite as impressed.

84   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- DINING ROOM - NIGHT            84

     Alan sits at the writers' table. Alone. Talks to the camera

     in whispered tones.

                           ALAN

               I've made an important decision as

               group leader. I've decided to ask

               William to leave the group. Now it

               has absolutely nothing to do with

               that incident at our house. It has

               nothing to do with the fact that I'm

               now sleeping in the guest room. But

               let's face it--the kid's a slacker.

               No contribution to the group. Zero.

               Zip. Nada. I'm sure he'll be fine

               with it.

                                                                 64.

85   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- DINING ROOM - NIGHT              85

     William kicks his CHAIR over. Alan, Colette, John, Henry and

     Hannah sit calmly around the table. Henry and Hannah apart.

                           ALAN

               There's no need to get so upset.

                           WILLIAM

               Fine. I was going to quit anyway.

               Leave this bunch of losers.

     William makes eye contact with Colette: You too? She looks

     away: Sorry. Only fuels William more. He points to Alan.

                           WILLIAM (CONT'D)

               Christ. You and your stupid recorder.

               And your stupid ideas. And your stupid

               character names.

     William clenches his fist and pretends it's a microphone.

                           WILLIAM (CONT'D)

               Name for character. Bobby Blow Me.

               Gimme a break.

     Alan sits stone-faced.    William turns to John.

                           WILLIAM (CONT'D)

               And G.I. Joe over here with that

               piece-of-crap, self-published tripe.

               Who are you kidding?

     Flustered, John starts to stand up.    Alan grabs John's arm,

     pulls him back down.

                           ALAN

               Just ignore him.

     William continues on his rant with Colette.

                           WILLIAM

               Colette, Colette, my pet. News Flash

               for you: Oprah's not calling--unless

               she needs a massage. Get real!

                            JOHN

               Oprah?   She's not on TV anymore.

                              COLETTE

               I know that.

      William turns his attention to Henry.

                                                          65.

                        WILLIAM

           The great Henry O. Man, you got the

           gift, bro'. But your head is up

           your ass over poor, sweet, successful

           Hannah here.

Hannah and Henry avoid looking at each other as William smiles

at Hannah.

                       WILLIAM (CONT'D)

           Hannah. Hannah. Hannah. We could

           have been so hot together. I'm just

           as good a writer as you are, but you

           sure look better in a skirt --

                       HENRY

               (Voice rising)

           That's enough.

                       WILLIAM

           I don't need any of you. I don't

           need any of your pointless, pedestrian

           feedback. I'm a writer.

                       JOHN

           You've got goddamn three pages.

                       WILLIAM

           They're a great three pages! You

           just don't appreciate my dedication.

                       HANNAH

           You're a pretend writer, William.

Silence.   William is surprised that Hannah speaks out.

                       HENRY

           She's right. You act the part. You

           like the lifestyle. You hit on women.

           You quote Bukowski. But Bukowski did

           the work. Each and every day he

           wrote. That's your problem, William.

           You don't do the work.

                       WILLIAM

           I don't do the work? Man, that sounds

           frickin' hilarious coming from you.

           When's the last time you wrote

           anything?

That hits a nerve. William and Henry stare each other down.

Enough. William flips off the group with his middle finger.

Mumbling, grumbling under his breath, he starts to leave.

Pauses at the WRITERS AT WORK sign. Picks it up.

                                                                 66.

                           ALAN

               Not the sign!

     Too late. William RIPS it in two. And a second time for

     good measure. Throwing the pieces on the ground. Stomps out

     of the house, slamming the front door.

     The group turns quiet for a long beat. Everyone calming down.

     Alan takes control again -- eyes still darting over to what's

     left of his beloved sign.

                           ALAN (CONT'D)

               Let's move on. Next item. Richard

               Benedict is going to be doing a

               signing at Wordsmith next week.

     Alan looks directly at Henry.

                           ALAN (CONT'D)

               Who wants to go?

86   INT. BOOKSTORE - DAY                                              86

     Large bookstore. Long line. Why? Because Richard Benedict

     is in the building, doing a signing of his new novel The

     Pineapple Man.

     Hannah, Henry, Alan, and Colette stand in line together,

     waiting. Colette is holding one copy of the BOOK. Hannah

     has one. Henry has one.

     Alan reaches inside his coat pocket for his RECORDER. Snaps

     it on.

                           ALAN

               Idea for novel. Jealous husband

               murders his tramp-of-a-wife and buries

               her chopped-up body in the back yard.

     Colette pretends not to hear. Line inches forward. Alan cranes

     his neck to see what's happening.

                           HENRY

                   (To himself)

               Mr. Benedict, I just want to thank

               you. No. You've inspired my writing--

               No. Hi. I'm Henry. I just think you're

               the greatest...

     Colette puts a friendly hand on Henry's shoulder.

                           COLETTE

               Let me tell you something, Henry.

                                                                67.

     Henry looks to her, expecting words of comfort.

                           COLETTE (CONT'D)

               One day, I'll have a signing like

               this.

     Colette looks around, already imagining the event.

87   INT. JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY                                    87

     John is bent over his PRINTER, jiggling the front end, trying

     to open it. Tapping it on the side. No luck.

                           JOHN

               Nope. Not going to see Richard

               whatever-his-name-is. John K.

               Butzin, author, doesn't need to stand

               in line anymore. No, sir. This soon-

               to-be best-selling writer is spending

               every minute, every dollar, on

               promoting Roaring Lion.

     Try as he might, John can't open up his printer. Sigrid

     appears. Leans in. Effortlessly opens up the printer. Takes

     the cartridge from John. Snaps it in. Shuts the lid. Done.

     John grunts his thanks.

                           JOHN (CONT'D)

               Strudel, check my sales ranking again.

     Sigrid steps to the computer and taps a couple keys. Stares

     at the screen.

                           SIGRID

                   (Reading out loud)

               1,644,973 . . .

     Not quite the hoped-for response. Turns quiet inside the

     mobile home. John clears his throat.

                           JOHN

               Wow. Look how far I've moved up

               already.

     Sigrid types again. Reads off the screen.

                           SIGRID

               John Grisham. 12.

     Forget about John for the moment. Watch Sigrid as her eyes

     dart around--from the screen, to John in the chair, out the

     window. Back again. This is the moment. Sigrid gets it

     now: John K. Butzin is not the author he pretends to be.

     Very quiet in the mobile home.

                                                                  68.

88   INT. BOOKSTORE - DAY                                               88

     The AUTHOR (50's) sits at the signing table, obliging, but

     not outgoing, grunting hello to people and smiling (somewhat)

     for photos as he signs BOOKS. He is not here by choice today.

     CAPTION: RICHARD BENEDICT

     The young CLERK hovers nearby, assisting with books and trying

     to keep the line moving.

     Henry is first, followed by Alan and Colette, then Hannah.

     Henry clutches his copy. Good luck trying to rip it from

     his hands. The four get nearer to Benedict.

                           ALAN

               He's older than I thought.

                           HANNAH

               I've never seen him before.

                           HENRY

                   (To himself)

               Pleasure to meet you. No. Honor to

               meet you. He She They is my favorite

               novel.

     Closer...Closer...Closer they get to the table. Richard signs

     away. Henry seems transfixed by him. Now it's his turn to

     have his book signed.

                           CLERK

               Next, please.

     The moment has arrived. Henry stands directly in front of

     Richard Benedict. Henry seems nervous. Too nervous to speak.

     Richard looks up and for the slightest, milli-second their

     eyes meet.

     At that exact moment, RICHARD'S CELL PHONE GOES OFF. He

     answers.

                           RICHARD

                   (On phone)

               What?!

     Henry stands there, unable to move, staring at Richard while

     he speaks on the phone.

                              CLERK

                      (To Henry)

               Sir?

     No response.   Alan nudges Henry. No good.

                                                            69.

                      CLERK (CONT'D)

          Sir? We need to keep the line moving.

          Sir?

Alan intervenes. He takes Henry's copy of the novel and slides

it over to Benedict. Benedict scribbles his name quickly and

slides it back with no eye contact, yelling on the phone.

                      RICHARD

              (On phone)

          Absolutely not! I'll sue that bastard

          first...

Alan grabs the book and gives it back to Henry, nudging him

again.

                      ALAN

          We need to move, Henry.

Alan and Colette slide their book over to Richard.

                      COLETTE

          Hi there.

Richard looks up at her for a split second and decides to

ignore her. Another scribbled signature as he remains on

the phone.

Colette takes the book, trying not to look hurt. Alan grabs

Henry and they leave the area. Hannah is next up. She puts

her book down on the table.

                      RICHARD

              (On phone)

          Damn it! That simply won't--

Richard glances up. Sees Hannah standing there. He stops in

mid-sentence. Smiles.

                      RICHARD (CONT'D)

          Hi.

                      HANNAH

          Hello.

Richard hangs up the phone.

The two start chatting. Camera goes over to the shell-shocked

Henry, still clutching his book, watching as Hannah and

Richard carry on. Henry is so disconcerted by what he sees

that he fails to notice Eudora, still with purple hair and

matching glasses, the very next person in line behind Hannah,

waving at him.

                                                               70.

89   EXT. BOOKSTORE - DAY                                            89

     Outside bookstore. After the signing. Alan and Colette walk

     ahead. Henry and Hannah follow. Colette, Henry and Hannah

     each carry book bags.

                           HENRY

               So what did he say?

                            HANNAH

               Who?

                           HENRY

               Who!?!? Richard Benedict. You know,

               the guy who just held up the line

               for five minutes talking to you?

                           ALAN

                   (Over his shoulder)

               Ten. It was closer to ten minutes.

                           HANNAH

               I don't know. We just talked.

                           HENRY

               He sure liked you.

                           HANNAH

               We just talked, Henry. I mentioned

               my book. He started asking about it.

               Writer to writer. No big deal.

                           HENRY

               No big deal? Talking to Richard

               Benedict. No big deal!

     Colette keeps walking. Biting her lip. Very quiet.

                           ALAN

               You gave him your phone number.

                           HANNAH

               Look, a guy like that reads more

               books in a week than I ever have.

               Why would he bother call--

     Just then, Hannah's iPhone goes off. She answers. The other

     three stop in their tracks.

                           HANNAH (CONT'D)

                   (On telephone)

               Hello? Who? Richard? Oh. Richard.

               Hi.

                                                          71.

                      COLETTE

          Unbelievable.

Henry inches closer to Hannah, forcing Hannah to move back,

creating an uneasy dance between the two. She turns her

back on Henry.

                      HANNAH

              (On telephone)

          Coffee? Oh, God. I don't know,

          Richard. I really appreciate the

          invitation, but--

She listens. Her face is anguished. Finally --

                      HANNAH (CONT'D)

          This isn't a good time. Call me later.

          Yes. I'll think about it. Yes. Bye.

Hannah turns off her phone. Alan, Colette, Henry stand there,

gaping jaws wide open.

                      ALAN

          Amazing.

                      COLETTE

          This isn't fair. This just isn't

          fair.

                      HANNAH

          What?

                      COLETTE

          First, you get an agent. Then you

          sell your book. Then the big movie

          deal.

                      ALAN

          Please don't.

                      COLETTE

          No. This isn't fair. And now Richard

          Benedict wants to have coffee with

          you? All this is happening to you.

          And only you. Isn't there anything --

          I don't know--some kind of cosmic

          creative crumb for the rest of us to

          nibble on?

                      HANNAH

          I don't like what you're suggesting,

          Colette. You know how hard I work.

          How devoted I am. And I have been

          totally supportive of your writing.

          I've encouraged you all along.

                                                                  72.

                           COLETTE

               You wouldn't introduce me to your

               agent.

                           HANNAH

               Brian didn't want to meet you. I

               asked.

                           ALAN

               Hannah has earned her success.

                           COLETTE

               Butt out Mr. Idea Man.

                           ALAN

               Hannah is a writer. She devotes

               herself one hundred percent to

               writing. Not one hundred percent to

               sleeping with writers.

     Henry steps in.    Finally.

                           HENRY

               Why don't you two just go on ahead?

                           COLETTE

               It's not fair that she be the only

               one.

                                HENRY

               Go.

                             ALAN

               C'mon.    Let's go.

     Colette marches off in a huff; Alan in pursuit. She looks

     over her shoulder, shouting back at Hannah.

                                COLETTE

               13! 13!    13!     13!

90   EXT. CITY BENCH - DAY                                              90

     Henry and Hannah sit on opposite ends of the bench. Hannah

     looks distraught, lost in thought, simmering.

     Henry knows to keep his distance. Waits.

91   EXT. COLETTE'S GARDEN - DAY                                        91

     Colette looks frazzled. Pondering. Plotting. She finally

     notices the camera.

                                                                   73.

                           COLETTE

               I know. I'm a shit for exploding at

               Hannah, aren't I?

     Runs her hands through her hair.

                           COLETTE (CONT'D)

               Poor, sweet, superstitious, everybody-

               loves-Hannah.

     Starts massaging forehead--trying to reduce stress.

                           COLETTE (CONT'D)

               If she can succeed, so can I. "We

               were born to succeed, not to fail."

     Hears a question O.S.

                           COLETTE (CONT'D)

               Who said that? I don't know.

               Somebody famous. Somebody with an

               agent.

     Now come the deep breaths.      More stress control.

                           COLETTE (CONT'D)

               I can't accomplish anything without

               an agent. They won't come to me.

               Fine. I'll go to them. I'll make it

               happen.

92   EXT. CITY BENCH - DAY                                               92

     Hannah and Henry remain on the bench.      Hannah takes a breath

     and finally breaks her silence.

                           HANNAH

               Your writer's block?

                             HENRY

               Yeah.

                           HANNAH

               It's because your focus is always on

               everything else. Gatsby. Fitzgerald.

               Me.

     Whoa. Henry isn't about to argue.

                           HANNAH (CONT'D)

               Listen to me, Henry Obert. Your

               writing must come first. Take this

               passion you have. Put it on the page.

               Forget everything else. All you're

               doing is wasting...

                                                                 74.

     Hannah continues the lecture, speaking from the heart.

                           HENRY (V.O.)

               She's right. But I know what's really

               happening here. Hannah's telling me

               she has every intention of talking

               to Richard Benedict. She has every

               intention of seeing him.

93   INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY                                         93

     There. On the discount table up by the cash register lies a

     pile of Roaring Lion books under another handmade SIGN: 50%

     OFF! Sigrid stares at the pile of unwanted books in quiet

     contemplation. Heavy sigh.

     Sigrid glances up. Her boss watches her from the cash

     register with a certain longing. He smiles. Sigrid returns

     the smile.

     Back to business. Sigrid pulls a wad of DOLLAR BILLS from

     her hip pocket. Counts quickly. Then picks up John's books,

     one by one.

94   INT. JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY                                     94

     John looks like the proverbial kid in a candy store.   In

     total shock as he clutches a handful of TWENTIES.

                           JOHN

               Wow! All the books sold at the

               hardware store?

                            SIGRID

               Ja.   Every one.

     John claps his hands together. There is a certain spring in

     his feet.

                           JOHN

               Didn't I tell you, Strudel?   Write

               it and they will read.

     John can't contain his enthusiasm as he paces the mobile

     home, his mind racing. Sigrid is more composed.

                           JOHN (CONT'D)

               Get some more copies down there.

               Maybe do another signing. Yeah.

               No. Time for a real tour. Fresno.

               Bakersfield. Stockton. Call a few

               bookstores. Let 'em know John K.

               Butzin is coming. Lock and load.

                                                                 75.

     And he's off, leaving the frame, already planning his big

     adventure, leaving Sigrid alone.

     Facing the camera, she nods slightly. Then offers us a small

     wave.

                             SIGRID

               Bye.   Bye.

95   INT. LOIS PIPER AGENCY - DAY                                      95

     The small reception area for The Lois Piper Agency. Tastefully

     decorated. PHONES constantly chirping.

     The young MALE ASSISTANT behind the counter, obviously paid

     to be patient, points to the framed sign on the counter, in

     large letters: NO UNSOLICITED MANUSCRIPTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.

     Colette and Dr. Xiroman will not be deterred. She holds a

     thick MANILA ENVELOPE.

                            COLETTE

               I have to see Ms. Piper. We just

               need five minutes. 1-2-3-4-5 minutes

               of her time.

     The assistant points back to the sign.

                           COLETTE (CONT'D)

               Can you just please stick your head

               in her office, tell her that Colette

               Mooney is here. I know she's busy,

               but she'll certainly want to see my

               manuscript.

     The assistant ignores her.

                           COLETTE (CONT'D)

                   (Flustered)

               I'm a graduate of Mills College.

     Behind them, coming from the inner office, we hear LOIS PIPER

     YELLING.

                           LOIS (O.S.)

               If I have to read one more vampire

               story, I swear I'll drive a stake

               through my own goddamn heart.

     MANUSCRIPT comes flying out of her office. Loose pages

     splatter everywhere in the main office. Lois Piper quickly

     follows. Older. Tired. Needs a drink. Now.

     CAPTION: LOIS PIPER

                                                               76.

                           LOIS (CONT'D)

               Vampires! Zombies! Harry Potter

               knock-offs! People writing about

               their dogs! Just shoot me now!

     It is at that moment when Lois first notices the camera.

     Caught off-guard. What the hell??? Colette cranes her neck

     over the assistant.

                            COLETTE

               Ms. Piper?   Ms. Piper?

     Lois turns her attention to Colette. Who are you? Then--

     magically--Lois changes. A big smile replaces the scowl.

     She marches towards Colette, who is clearly not expecting a

     warm reception.

     Lois walks right past Colette and instead warmly shakes hands

     with Dr. Xiroman.

                           LOIS

               Dr. Xiroman. I can't believe you're

               here. How lovely to see you again.

     Dr. Xiroman nods his head in greeting.

                           LOIS (CONT'D)

               Just in the neighborhood? Please

               come in for a minute.

     Another glance at the camera. Then, taking Dr. Xiroman by

     the elbow, Lois guides him back towards her office, completely

     snubbing a bewildered Colette.

                           LOIS (CONT'D)

               My family talks about you all the

               time. You were so helpful to my

               sister. She's doing much better.

     Colette stands there helplessly, watching her future walk

     away. The assistant points in their direction: Get in there!

96   INT. PIPER OFFICE - DAY                                          96

     Lois plops down behind her desk. Stacks of MANUSCRIPTS cover

     her desk. Dr. Xiroman sits quietly in one chair. Colette

     sits next to him.

                           LOIS

                   (Sighing; Distraught)

               Look at my desk, Dr. Xiroman. Look

               at all this. Do you know what it is?

               Crap. It's all crap. Crap. Crap.

               Crap. I hate my job. I hate my life.

                                                          77.

Dr. Xiroman nods: I understand.

                      LOIS (CONT'D)

          Know what I feel like doing?

She looks at the camera.

                      LOIS (CONT'D)

          Come in closer. I want you to get

          this. Closer. C'mon. More. Closer.

Satisfied, Lois takes her free hand and SHOVES ALL THE

MANUSCRIPTS off her desk, sending them flying on the floor.

                        LOIS (CONT'D)

          Wheeeeee!

Colette looks aghast.   Lois seems free at last.

                      LOIS (CONT'D)

          That was so...liberating. I haven't

          felt this good since that night in

          Paris with Salman Rushdie.

Lois growls like a tiger at the memory.

                      LOIS (CONT'D)

          I envy you, Dr. Xiroman. Know that?

          Look at your life. Your work. You

          helped my sister. You've helped so

          many people. You have such a positive

          message to share.

The camera picks up on Lois as the light goes on, the wheels

start turning in her head.

                      LOIS (CONT'D)

          Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a

          minute. A positive message to share.

          Helping people. That's it!

                      COLETTE

              (Confused)

          What?

                      LOIS

          Of course. Dr. Xiroman, you should

          write a book. This could be a whole

          series.

                        COLETTE

          But--

                                                                  78.

                           LOIS

               --It's perfect! Television. Your

               own blog. Personal appearances.

                            COLETTE

               But--

     Dr. Xiroman has no reaction. Colette can't believe what she

     is hearing.

                           LOIS

               Getting from Xiro to One by Doctor

               Xiroman. Oh, I like that.

                            COLETTE

               But--

                           LOIS

               --In fact, as long as you're here

               today, why don't we just get you

               under contract? I know just who to

               call in New York.

                            COLETTE

               But--But.   What about me?

     Lois shoots her a look: What about you? Colette backs down--

     not wanting to spoil the moment. Lois yells for her assistant.

     Finally a slight smile crosses Dr. Xiroman's face.

97   INT. PIPER OFFICE - DAY                                            97

     Dr. Xiroman beams as he signs the standard agency contract

     so quickly drawn up for him. Lois and her Assistant appear

     equally excited.

     COLETTE fidgets off to the side. Then Lois hands her the pen

     and points her towards the contract.

                           COLETTE (V.O.)

               Co-Authors. Actually I'll be listed

               as junior author. It's not exactly

               what I wanted, but at least now I

               finally have an agent. And a book

               deal.

98   INT. PIPER OFFICE - DAY                                            98

     Lois and the Assistant wave goodbye as Colette and Dr.

     Xiroman leave.

                           COLETTE (V.O.)

               My novel will have to wait a while

               longer. Nyet, Colette. Not Yet. But

               soon.

                                                                   79.

99    EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT                                    99

      Henry delivers another pizza. Pockets the money as he walks

      back to his car, whistling. Checks his delivery list. Stares

      at the next address in sudden disbelief.

                              HENRY

                Shit!

100   EXT. RICHARD BENEDICT'S HOUSE - NIGHT                              100

      Henry stands in the doorway, glumly clutching the PIZZA BOX.

      Hesitates. Finally rings doorbell. Pause. Followed by LOUD

      LAUGHTER. Door swings open. Richard stands there, wearing

      only his jeans. His hair is a mess.

                            RICHARD

                You're late, Pizza Boy.

      Richard finally notices the camera.

                              RICHARD (CONT'D)

                What the --

                            HENRY

                    (Overlapping)

                They're with me. Your total comes to

                nineteen dollars and sixty-five cents.

      Richard pulls a crumpled twenty from his jean pocket. He

      hands it to Henry. Then reconsiders, calling inside.

                            RICHARD

                Babe, I need a single.

      No response.

                            RICHARD (CONT'D)

                C'mon, babe. Got a dollar for Pizza

                Boy?

                              WOMAN'S VOICE

                Coming!

      Richard gives a last glance to the camera. He's got better

      things to do. Off he goes.

      Short beat. Hannah comes to the door wearing Richard's shirt

      and little else, carrying a single dollar bill.

                              HANNAH

                Here you--

      Her words freeze up as she recognizes Henry. Henry and Hannah

      lock eyes for a long beat. Poor kid. This is the moment.

                                                          80.

Reality smacks him in the face. Hard.

Hannah starts to hand Henry the money. He puts his hands up:

No thanks. Hannah doesn't press. Henry can't hold back any

longer.

                      HENRY

          No distractions. The writing comes

          first.

                      HANNAH

          He's making me a better writer.

                        HENRY

          Yeah.    I bet he is.

Quietly seething, Henry nods towards the camera.

                      HENRY (CONT'D)

          How much better are you, Hannah?

          Show us. Who wrote Slaughterhouse

          Five? D'ya know?

                        HANNAH

          Henry.    Don't.

                      HENRY

          No, No. This could be quite

          educational. How about Native Son?

          Catch-22?

                      HANNAH

          Why isn't it enough that I'm your

          friend?

                      HENRY

          Lord of the Flies? Portnoy's

          Complaint? Do you know any author?

          Harry Potter--You must know Harry

          Potter.

                      HANNAH

          Why isn't it enough that I believe

          in your writing?

                      HENRY

          --Sophie's Choice? Anything published

          in the English language.

                      HANNAH

          --That I believe in you?

                      HENRY

          You didn't read Gatsby, did you?

          Never even opened it, I bet.

                                                                 81.

      Enough.

                              HANNAH

                I'm not--

      She hesitates.   Not for long.

                            HANNAH (CONT'D)

                I'm not the one delivering pizzas

                for a living.

      Score one for Hannah.

                            HANNAH (CONT'D)

                I'm not the one wasting my talent.

                You've read all those books, sure,

                but my book is being published. Is

                yours?

      Henry has no comeback. Hannah stares him down. The dollar

      bill drops from her hand on to the ground. She retreats

      back inside the house, firmly closing the front door, leaving

      Henry alone.

      Only then do we notice the number of the house: 4441.

101   INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                   101

      We've never seen Henry like this. He rips down all his Richard

      Benedict photos from the wall. Collects all his Benedict

      books. Stuffs everything in a CARDBOARD BOX. Next he turns

      his attention to all the rejection letters on the wall. Lot

      of rejection. Gives them a long look. Then he snaps up the

      photo of Hannah from near his computer. He takes the photo

      and tacks it dead center in the middle of all his rejection

      letters.

      Henry stares at the photo, oblivious to the camera, consumed

      by Hannah's radiant smile. His latest, and most painful,

      rejection. It's over.

      Henry understands what must be done. He goes over to his

      desk. Sits down at his laptop. One last glance over at

      Hannah's photo as he turns the computer on.

      He contemplates for a second. Then begins typing.

102   INT. JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY                                    102

      Sigrid's Wall of America has been taken down. A few nail

      holes and tape marks are all that remain--except for the

      single PHOTO of John still hanging in the center.

                                                                   82.

103   EXT. JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY                                      103

      Back to the two lawn chairs--with one prime difference.

      Sigrid's chair is empty. John sits by himself. This is a

      softer, more reflective, John talking to the camera.

                             JOHN

                 Well, Strudel shipped out.

      A side glance to the empty chair.

                             JOHN (CONT'D)

                 Oh, she wanted to stay, but... I

                 didn't have time for a relationship.

                 Not with my book selling like it is.

                 She, well, she became collateral

                 damage. Hated to end it. What a

                 dame. I mean...Sigrid. She had the

                 smarts of my first wife. The body

                 of my second wife. Thank god she

                 wasn't anything like my third wife.

                 I did the right thing. Yes, sir.

      Good acting, John. He looks back to the empty chair. Can't

      avoid reaching over and giving the arm rest a little love

      tap.

104   INT.   JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY                                    104

      John packs COPIES OF HIS BOOK ever-so-carefully into an old

      standard issue military DUFFEL BAG.

                             JOHN (V.O.)

                 What matters now is that the Roaring

                 Lion book tour is about to begin.

                 Can't wait to hit the road and meet

                 the good people of this nation.

                 Good American people.

      John gazes over at his photo on the wall. Salutes himself.

105   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- DINING ROOM - NIGHT               105

      Meeting of the writing group. Not yet started. John, Alan,

      and Hannah sit around the table. No refreshments being

      served. No small talk. Everyone is quiet.

      Hannah looks fantastic. More makeup. Nicer clothes. Fidgets

      in her chair. Seems anxious. Stares at her new KINDLE.

      FRONT DOOR opens and closes. FOOTSTEPS approaching. It's

      Henry. Looks determined. Man on a mission. Carries a satchel.

                             HENRY

                 Sorry I'm late.

                                                            83.

John grunts something. Hannah remains quiet. Avoids eye

contact with Henry. Henry reaches into his satchel and pulls

out stapled, typed pages. Multiple copies. Hands one to

each of the three group members. Puts another down where

Colette will sit.

                      JOHN

          Wutch you got here, Obert?

                       HENRY

          New pages.   I'm ready to read.

                      ALAN

          Way to go, Henry.

Even Hannah looks surprised. She and Alan thumb through their

copies. John sniffs at the front page. Henry slides in across

from Hannah. Looks satisfied. FRONT DOOR opens again. MORE

FOOTSTEPS. Colette arrives with Dr. Xiroman in tow. Xiroman?

The others exchange puzzled glances.

                       JOHN

          Christ.   What's he doing here?

                      COLETTE

          I've invited Doctor Xiroman to join

          our writing group.

                      ALAN

          You must be joking, Colette.

                      COLETTE

          I am not joking. And, as a matter

          of fact, I'll have all of you know

          that the doctor and I are soon to be

          published authors. We've signed with

          The Lois Piper Agency.

Colette stands there, waiting for the applause and

congratulations, but all she receives is stunned silence.

                      HENRY

          You can't do this.

                      COLETTE

          Why not? With William gone, we have

          an opening.

                      ALAN

          Henry's right. We all have to agree

          on new members.

                      COLETTE

          I don't care about your silly rules.

                                                                84.

                      ALAN

          I am the leader of the group--

                      COLETTE

          --Oh, please. Alan.

                      ALAN

              (Voice rising)

          I am the leader of the group.

                      COLETTE

          And Dr. Xiroman is my co-author and

          he is joining "the group."

                         ALAN

          He is not.

                         COLETTE

          He is.

                         ALAN

          Is not.

                         COLETTE

          Is.

                         ALAN

          Is n--

Hannah can't take it any longer. She throws up her hands.

                      HANNAH

              (Yelling)

          STOP!

The room turns quiet. All eyes on Hannah. She composes

herself.

                         HANNAH (CONT'D)

          I'm leaving.

Surprise all around.    Hannah avoids looking at Henry.

                      HANNAH (CONT'D)

          It's time. Richard is going to mentor

          me. Today's the 22nd. Two plus two

          equals four and we all know four's...

Her voice trails off.    Why bother explaining.   Just do it.

                      HANNAH (CONT'D)

          Anyway, I'm quitting.

There. She said it. Hannah looks so relieved. She's done.

Indignant, Colette stares her up and down.

                                                            85.

Points to Dr.    Xiroman.

                      COLETTE

          Well, in this case one plus one equals

          one very successful writing team. I

          can't believe you, Hannah. You're

          doing this just to upstage our news

          about landing an agent.

                        ALAN

          Stop it...

                      COLETTE

          No, this is what it's all about.

          The spotlight always has to be on

          Little Miss Sunshine. Her agent. Her

          book deal. Her movie deal.

John shoots to his feet.

                      JOHN

          News flash for you all. John K.

          Butzin is also saying Sayonara.

          Heading off on my international book

          tour.

                      HENRY

          International?

                      JOHN

          Damn straight. Tijuana.

              (Beat)

          I'm done with you pussies.

John snatches up his folder and marches out of the house.

Silence. Colette starts to sit down at the table--motions

for Xiroman to join her. Final straw for Alan. Stares

directly at Colette.

                        ALAN

          Get out.    Now.

Colette can't believe what she's hearing.

                      ALAN (CONT'D)

          As the leader of this writing group,

          I've determined your actions are

          contrary to our stated purpose. Get

          out.

                      COLETTE

          You can't kick me out.    I live here.

She's right.    Alan considers his options.

                                                               86.

                       ALAN

          Fine.   Then go to your room.

Points to Xiroman.

                      ALAN (CONT'D)

          And take him with you. Won't be the

          first guy.

Alan means business.   Colette stands up straight.   Gathers

up her materials.

                      COLETTE

          We'll certainly have plenty to discuss

          in therapy.

                      ALAN

          Go by yourself. I'm done.

                     COLETTE

          Oh. Just like always--Alan finishes

          first.

She grabs Dr. Xiroman's arm.

                      COLETTE (CONT'D)

          Come, Dr. Xiroman. I'm looking forward

          to working with a real doctor. On

          our new book.

Colette and Dr. Xiroman disappear. Frustrated, Alan takes a

deep breath. Reaches inside his coat pocket for his recorder.

Turns it on.

                      ALAN

          Idea for novel.

Alan hesitates. Thinks for a second. Turns off the recorder.

Slides it across the table to Henry.

                      ALAN (CONT'D)

          Here. Take it. Maybe you can use

          some of my ideas in your novel.

Alan flashes a "thumbs up" sign to Henry and to Hannah.    He

starts to leave, but remembers the camera.

                      ALAN (CONT'D)

              (To camera)

          This was supposed to be a reality

          series.

That's off his chest. Alan leaves Henry and Hannah alone at

the table. Awkward silence.

                                                                  87.

      He stands up. Calmly puts his typed pages back in his

      satchel. Leaves Alan's recorder on the table, walks away

      without looking back.

                              HANNAH

                Henry . . .

      Don't waste your breath. He's gone.

106   INT. BOOKSTORE - DAY                                              106

      Hannah's book release party. Great turnout. Her professional

      PHOTO adorns a POSTER announcing the publication of Sleeping

      on the Moon. Boy, Hannah looks terrific in that photo.

      Richard hovers around the makeshift bar, drink in hand.

      Maureen, looking radiant, accepts the congratulations of

      well-wishers. TABLE prominently centered has piles of Hannah's

      novel, waiting to be signed.

      Hannah talks to the camera, looking especially radiant. This

      is her day and she is more than ready for her close-up.

      Totally different in wardrobe and appearance.

                            HANNAH

                Exciting, isn't it? I'm so nervous.

                I don't know half these people. Most

                of them are Richard's friends.

      Hannah waves to Richard. He waves back. Hannah glances around

      the room, as if looking for someone in particular.

                            HANNAH (CONT'D)

                Nobody's showed up from my old writing

                group. Not one. Probably shouldn't

                be surprised. Haven't really heard

                from anyone in months.

      She is asked a question.

                            HANNAH (CONT'D)

                Favorite writer? You keep asking me

                that. Too funny. Sorry. Still can't

                think of one.

107   INT. BOOKSTORE - DAY                                              107

      Hannah sits behind the table, signing books. Maureen stands

      behind her helping to orchestrate the line of people.

      Hannah acts very gracious. Signing a book, smiling and

      chatting up the guests. She seems at ease. Everything is

      going her way. She looks past the line. Her eyes light up

      and she jumps to her feet.

                                                             88.

                         HANNAH

          Oh my God!

Hannah bolts from the table, cuts through the line and finds

Henry standing alone.

                         HENRY

          Hi, Hannah.

                      HANNAH

          Henry. Ohhhhh. Thank you. Thank

          you. Thank you so much for coming.

Hannah throws her arms around Henry, giving him a long

heartfelt hug, almost smothering the poor guy--not that he

complains. She lets go and gives Henry a friendly once-over.

                      HANNAH (CONT'D)

          You're the only one from the group

          who showed up.

Still awkward for them to be around each other.

                      HANNAH (CONT'D)

          I can't believe you remembered my

          signing.

                      HENRY

          Well, pretty hard to miss that article

          about you in People magazine. Just

          wanted to say hi. And congratulations.

Maureen comes up behind Hannah. Beams at Henry, and waves.

                      MAUREEN

          Hello, Henry.

              (To Hannah)

          Hannah, come back. Your public awaits.

                      HENRY

          Go on. They need you.

                         HANNAH

          Please stay.

                       HENRY

          Can't.   Sorry.

                         HANNAH

          Oh.

                      HENRY

          Yeah. Hot date. You know. Can't keep

          her waiting. A flight attendant.

                                                             89.

                      HANNAH

              (Buying the obvious

               lie)

          A flight attendant?

Henry nods.

                         HANNAH (CONT'D)

          Well, then.     Guess you can't stay.

                         HENRY

          Sorry.

                       HANNAH

          One sec.   Wait here.

Hannah runs back to the signing table, pulls out a book and

scribbles something inside. She brings the book back over to

Henry.

                      HANNAH (CONT'D)

          This is for you.

                       HENRY

              (Protesting)

          Hannah . . .

                         HANNAH

          Take it.

Henry accepts the book. Hannah gives him another long hug.

                      HANNAH (CONT'D)

          Do you want to say hello to Richard?

                      HENRY

          No. No, thanks.

                      HANNAH

          C'mon. It will take just a minute.

                       HENRY

          I can't.   Really.

                      MAUREEN

          Dear, sweet Hannah. Please!

                         HANNAH

          Just say hi.

Henry tries to back away. Hannah leans forward, grabs his

hand and tugs him in the other direction.

                      HENRY

          I've really got to --

                                                                   90.

                             HANNAH

                Oh, c'mon.   You'll --

      Then -- BAM, Henry, not looking where he's going, slams into

      Richard accidentally, spilling Richard's drink all over the

      author. Horrified looks all around.

108   EXT. OUTSIDE BOOKSTORE - DAY                                       108

      Outside the bookstore, Henry stands on the sidewalk, talking

      to the camera as he clutches Hannah's book.

                            HENRY

                Well, I did it. I showed up to

                Hannah's signing. I congratulated

                her. I supported her, writer to

                writer. And I finally got introduced

                to Richard Benedict--formally. Sort

                of.

      Henry opens up his copy of Hannah's novel. He turns quiet,

      obviously moved. He holds the book up for the camera to

      see.

                           HENRY (CONT'D)

                Look. Hannah dedicated her novel to

                me. Just like she promised.

      Right beneath the printed dedication For Henry Obert, Hannah

      has written, For Henry, My Forever Friend xoxoxo Hannah.

      Henry studies the book for a second. Snaps it shut.

109   INT. KELLER OFFICE - DAY                                           109

      Literary agent David Keller being interviewed for the camera

      in his office. Stacks of MANUSCRIPTS on his desk. David

      pulls one out.

                            DAVID

                This is why I love LA. True story.

                This guy delivers a pizza to my house

                one night. Then the very next week,

                my wife has someone come in and clean

                the carpets. Guess what? Same guy.

                Small world, isn't it? So we get

                talking. He tells me his name's

                Henry. He's a writer. He's just

                finished a manuscript. Offers us a

                discount on the carpets if I'll read

                ten pages. I like that thinking.

                So I read ten pages. Wow. I want to

                read ten more. Before I know it,

                I've read the entire book.

                            (MORE)

                                                                   91.

                            DAVID (CONT'D)

                Just loved it. Fresh voice.

                Interesting characters. And that

                ending.

      David thumbs through the manuscript.

                            DAVID (CONT'D)

                The washed-up, impotent novelist

                getting gunned down by Scott, the

                jealous, underemployed, pizza delivery

                man. This kid nailed it. It's on the

                page, know what I mean? So I intend

                to sign Mr. Henry Obert and get Pizza

                to Go out there. I predict a best

                seller. Probably a movie, too.

                I'll call him with the good news. Or

                maybe I'll just order a pizza.

110   INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                       110

      Henry taking down the rejection letters from his walls and

      packing them in a cardboard BOX.

                            HENRY (V.O.)

                David Keller did call me. One week

                later, he sold Pizza to Go to a New

                York publisher. They decided to

                rename it A Slice of LA. I did it.

                I sold my novel.

      Henry puts the last of the rejection letters away. Finally,

      he picks up a FRAMED PHOTO. INSERT shows the six members of

      the writing group from happier times--the photo snapped in

      the restaurant. Full of hope and promise.

                            HENRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                I miss the Tuesday night group.

                They made me a better writer. They

                taught me how to handle rejection.

      Henry lingers on the photo before packing it away, as well.

111   INT. RESTAURANT #2 - DAY                                           111

      Mostly empty. Henry sits at a booth, alone, a new copy of

      Gatsby in his hands. He talks to the camera. CUP OF COFFEE

      in front of him.

                            HENRY

                Hannah was right. The writing must

                always come first. Everything else

                waits. Everything. That's what I

                did finally. Finished my novel.

                            (MORE)

                                                          92.

                      HENRY (CONT'D)

          Sold it. Now? Now I'm open. Ready

          for whatever--

WAITRESS stops by the table, refilling Henry's cup. Then

setting the pot on the table, she reaches over and snatches

the copy of Gatsby.

Surprised, Henry glances up.

                      HENRY (CONT'D)

          --happens next...

It's her again. That young waitress with purple streaks in

her hair and matching purple glasses thumbs through the book.

Henry finally checks out her name tag: Eudora.

Clutching the book, Eudora recites from memory:

                      EUDORA

          Gatsby believed in the green light,

          the orgiastic future that year by

          year recedes before us. It eluded us

          then, but that's no matter--

                      HENRY

              (Surprised)

          --Tomorrow we will run faster, stretch

          out our arms further...

Eudora nods. Henry is amazed.

                      HENRY (CONT'D)

          You know Fitzgerald?

                      EUDORA

          Not intimately. He died here, you

          know.

                      HENRY

          December 21, 1940.

                      EUDORA

          I go by there sometimes.

                      HENRY

          The place on Hayworth.

                      EUDORA

          Is that weird. That I do that?

                      HENRY

          No. No. Not at all.

Eudora smiles, glad for the positive reinforcement.

                                                                  93.

                            EUDORA

                OK. Good. Because, you know, I don't

                want people to think I'm weird.

                            HENRY

                Of course not. Do you write?

                            EUDORA

                Kinda, sort of. But I'm thinking of

                joining a writing group.

      Henry bites his tongue.   Eudora nods towards the camera.

                            EUDORA (CONT'D)

                So what's this? Some kind of reality

                show, or something?

      Henry smiles. The two continue their idle chatter.

                            JOHN (V.O.)

                After a very successful book tour,

                John K. Butzin heard the Grand Canyon

                State calling. This is home now.

113   EXT. MOBILE HOME PARK (ARIZONA) -- DAY                            113

      John's trailer. COSTUMED CHILDREN knock on the door while

      holding their trick or treat bags.

                            JOHN (V.O.)

                Real God-fearing Americans live here.

                Good people. Not those La La pussies.

      John opens the front door.

                            CHILDREN

                Trick or Treat!

      John responds by dropping a BOOK in the first bag.

                            JOHN

                Look at this treat you get. A copy

                of Roaring Lion by John K. Butzin.

                Happy Halloween.

      The children are dumbfounded. John moves on to the next child.

                                                                  94.

114   INT. RESTAURANT #2 - DAY                                          114

      William is back at the counter, looking as scruffy as ever.

      Off to the side stands a GEEKY KID, gripping a FLIP PHONE

      aimed directly at William. William talks to our camera.

                              WILLIAM

                  C'mon. Admit it. You missed me.

                  It wasn't as interesting once I left,

                  right?

      He winks.   The Kid doesn't move.

                              WILLIAM (CONT'D)

                  I knew the group wouldn't last without

                  me. No way. Losers.

      He nods towards his companion.

                              WILLIAM (CONT'D)

                  Him? Oh. It's my new project. A

                  reality TV show based on my life.

                  You know...women I meet...thoughts

                  that pop into my head. Kid follows

                  me all around. 24/7. Actually I got

                  the idea from you guys. Same concept--

                  just better characters.

      A question is asked.

                              WILLIAM (CONT'D)

                  Which network? Um, well...it's

                  a...it's P-P-A...Pasadena Public

                  Access. Oh, people watch. Yeah.

                  We're on right after that pet psychic.

      A waitress's HAND reaches in and refills William's coffee

      cup. He likes what he sees.

                              WILLIAM (CONT'D)

                  Thanks, babe.

      He looks over to Geeky Kid.

                              WILLIAM (CONT'D)

                  Get a close-up on her. Nice and

                  tight.

      William will never change.

                              WILLIAM (CONT'D)

                  And, hey, Kid. Lend me five bucks.

                  I want to leave an extra special

                  tip.

                                                                   95.

115   INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY (LOS ANGELES) -- DAY                           115

      TWO POSTERS ON EASEL in the hallway. First poster announcing:

                            ALAN (V.O.)

                After I sent Colette packing, I was

                ready for a new chapter in my life...

      SATURDAY'S ADULT EDUCATION CLASSES.

      PUPPET MAKING meets in Room 22, and QUILTING is in Room 24.

      WRITING 20/20 is in Room 26.

      And DOG OBEDIENCE is out in the courtyard, but we already

      know that--the loud sound of BARKING DOGS and PEOPLE YELLING

      "SIT" is heard in the background.

      Second poster is a new version of QUIET, PLEASE--WRITERS AT

      WORK.

                            ALAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                I found it teaching Adult Ed. "Writing

                20/20" is the class. Helping writers

                to see. Inspired by my new self-

                published e-book of the same title.

116   INT. SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY                                        116

      STUDENTS scattered around the classroom. All adult. Ethnic

      and demographic mix. Listening attentively. Taking notes.

      The DOGS continue barking outside.

      Alan stands in front of the class. Beaming. Excited, He CLAPS

      his hands once.

                            ALAN

                OK. You've got ten seconds. Write

                down the name of your character.

                First name that pops into mind. C'mon.

                Tell me your character.

      Students think for a second. Start scribbling a name.

                            ALAN (CONT'D)

                1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-9.5-9.75-10 seconds.

                OK. Pass your names up front here.

                Let's see what you came up with.

      Students hand their papers forward. Alan starts collecting

      them.

                            ALAN (CONT'D)

                The right name is so important for

                your character. OK. What do we have?

                                                                  96.

      He looks at the first piece of paper.

                            ALAN (CONT'D)

                Here's one I haven't heard. Heywood

                Ja-Jabloom???

      That's not it.   Alan tries again.

                            ALAN (CONT'D)

                Or is it Jablom? Maybe Jablowme.

                Heywood Jablowme?

      Laughter and guffaws from the students.    Alan looks puzzled.

                            ALAN (CONT'D)

                What's so funny? Heywood Jablowme?

                Am I missing something? Heywood

                Jablowme?

      The students continue to laugh. Poor Alan.

117   EXT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE - DAY                               117

      Catch the FOR SALE sign posted on the front lawn.

118   EXT. COLETTE'S GARDEN - DAY                                       118

      Colette engages in intense meditation on her bench. The garden

      around her is now dead.

                            COLETTE (V.O.)

                Dr. Xiroman and I wrote our book. It

                actually did fairly well.

      INSERT BOOK. Title in large letters: Getting from Xiro to

      One by Dr. Xiroman in equally large letters. At the bottom

      of the book, in very tiny letters, reads With Colette Mooney.

                            COLETTE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                Dr. Phil turned us down. But we had

                a lovely time on Anderson.

      INSERT PHOTO of smiling Anderson Cooper.

                            COLETTE (CONT'D)

                Anderson actually wanted us back,

                but Dr. Xiroman and Lois Piper started

                dating. They eloped to Vegas last

                month. Off on a world cruise.

      INSERT PHOTO of Dr. Xiroman and Lois being married in Vegas

      by ELVIS.

                                                                  97.

                            COLETTE (CONT'D)

                So in less than a year, I've lost my

                husband, my co-author, and my agent.

                But I still have Nyet, Not Yet. And

                I will find an agent to sell my novel.

                Look. I bought an ad in the trades.

      Colette reaches for her reading glasses and shares the ad

      copy with us, reading aloud:

                            COLETTE (CONT'D)

                "The magic fingers that just typed

                the publishing world's next best

                selling novel are now waiting to

                provide free massage to interested

                literary agents. Experienced.

                Sensitive. Discreet. Memorable. No

                Junior Agents, please."

      Looking quite pleased with herself, Colette lets the copy

      fall away.

                            COLETTE (CONT'D)

                It's how I met my last husband. I

                think it can work again. No worries.

                After all, I am a graduate of --

      Her iPhone starts playing music, signaling a phone call.

      Colette smiles in knowing satisfaction--publication is just

      a touch away

119   EXT. MOVIE SET -- DAY                                             119

      The MOVIE CREW, on location, scurries about, trying to line

      up their next shot.

                            HANNAH (V.O.)

                Welcome to Sleeping on the Moon: The

                Movie! It's so exciting!

120   EXT. MOVIE SET -- DAY                                             120

      Hannah, looking good, sits in a chair, a BOOK on her lap.

      She is talking to the camera. CREW in the background.

                            HANNAH

                Let's see. My book ended up on the

                best sellers list. Stopping at Number

                13.

      She crinkles her nose in obvious disappointment.

                            HANNAH (CONT'D)

                Then Richard left me.

                            (MORE)

                                                             98.

                         HANNAH (CONT'D)

             I'm sure the two were connected. No

             loss. Such an ego. But guess what?

             I've gone back to school!

To underscore the point, she holds up a the book--it's The

Great Gatsby.

                         HANNAH (CONT'D)

             Look what I'm reading for class.

             Isn't that pretty, you know, what do

             they call it? What's that word?

She hears an answer.

                         HANNAH (CONT'D)

             Ironic. That's it. Pretty ironic.

             But I'm going to get my degree.

             Then I'll be smart. Really smart.

Short beat

                         HANNAH (CONT'D)

             You know how you kept asking me that

             question. Who's my favorite writer?

Short beat.

                         HANNAH (CONT'D)

             Turns out I do have one. Mr. Henry

             Obert. He's become a great writer.

             A published author.

She smiles.

                         HANNAH (CONT'D)

             I knew him when.

She likes her answer.    But then hesitates.

                         HANNAH (CONT'D)

             Probably shouldn't tell him I said

             that, 'kay?

She winks.

                         HANNAH (CONT'D)

             Keep it between us.

Goodbye Hannah.    Good luck.

                                                                   99.

121   EXT. FITZGERALD/GRAHAM HOME -- HOLLYWOOD - DAY                     121

                            HENRY (V.O.)

                Well, my novel finally came out.

                Seems to be doing OK.

122   EXT. FITZGERALD/GRAHAM HOME/SIDEWALK -- DAY                        122

      Henry looks more confident. More poised. Better clothes.

      The frog has become the prince.

      He glances back at the building.

                            HENRY

                You know Fitzgerald said that all

                good writing is swimming under water

                and holding your breath. He was right.

                But after all I've been through, I

                think I'm finally ready to exhale.

      He looks at his watch.

                            HENRY (CONT'D)

                Oops. I'm late. Gotta go.

123   EXT. BOOKSTORE -- DAY                                              123

      SHOPPERS coming in and out of the store. POSTER in front

      window announces book signing for Henry Obert, author of

      Slice of LA.

      Right next to BANNER announcing GOING OUT OF BUSINESS. And

      next to the banner--a YOUNG MAN leans up against the wall,

      waiting, passing time reading his KINDLE.

124   INT. BOOKSTORE - DAY                                               124

      We jump to the woman clutching FOUR COPIES of Henry's novel.

      Wait a minute--we recognize those trendy glasses. It's Eudora,

      a rather pregnant Eudora.

                            EUDORA

                    (Laughing)

                Yes, I'm totally busted. I'm buying

                four copies of A Slice of LA. One

                for each member of my writing group.

                Also because I think Henry Wayne

                Obert is the greatest new writer of

                the decade! Sexiest, too!

      Eudora is having way too much fun.

                            EUDORA (CONT'D)

                OK. So he's my husband. I'm biased.

                But I still think the kid can write.

                                                                  100.

125   INT. BOOKSTORE - DAY                                               125

      Henry sits at the table in the bookstore, graciously and

      happily signing copies of his book for the SHORT LINE OF

      PEOPLE waiting.

      This is his moment, the one that brought him all the way

      from Illinois. He has arrived. As a person. As a writer.

      Henry looks up. Eudora is nestled comfortably in a nearby

      leather chair, reading away. She looks up.

      They make eye contact. Her smile is all the encouragement

      Henry needs. All that he will ever need.

      He reaches for the next book to sign.

                                                          FADE OUT:
